Since we had about 14 people, we got one of their private rooms downstairs. The room was spacious and fitted 2 tables; a big one seating us 14 very comfortably and another kiddie table seating 5. The room was decorated nicely with Chinese New Years decorations. It was clean and super accommodating. We loved how they had a big flat screen TV playing the Warriors but with Chinese commentators. lol. \n\nFOOD (in order with pics): \n- pork bone and meat dipped in sweet&sour sauce\n- sauteed beef with bell peppers and mushroom\n- fried egg yolk\n- walnut prawns\n- stir-fried black bean clams\n- white meat chicken \n- snow peas\n- stir-fried water spinach w/ fermented tofu\n- sweet and sour pork chops\n\n- shrimp with eggs dipped in jalapeno soy sauce!\n- salty egg yolk crab\n- fried fish head from the snapper\n- whole red snapper fish \n\nMy favorites were the snow peas, water spinach w/ fermented tofu, sizzling beef, sweet and sour pork, red snapper, fried fish head, and black bean clams! Everything was flavored and seasoned just right. The salty egg yolk crab and shrimp was a hit amongst my family. The fried fish head from the snapper was fried nicely with mushrooms, garlic cloves, onions, and bell peppers. The red snapper took the longest to come out. It was our last dish and spaced out 15 minutes so we were like \"what is going on..\" lol. The red snapper was super pearly white and soft. I purposely saved a third of my bowl of rice just to eat with the fish so I can submerge my rice in the fish sauce and green onions. It was delicious. \n\nWe had two servers throughout our meal; a man and a woman. they were both very attentive and came regularly to give us water refills, napkins, etc. The TV playing the Warriors was definitely a bonus. In total, for soup, 13 dishes, dessert, steamed custard bun, oranges, the bill was ~$600 with gratuity. Very worth it cause the food was delicious, portions were generous, service was attentive, and we even left with 6 boxes of leftovers!!\n\nP.S. Did I mention how fluffy and tender their rice was!? My family especially my mom and grandma raved about how perfect they cooked their rice and couldn't stop eating it. When your momma and g'ma is constantly talking about the rice, you know its some damn good rice!", "author": "Anissa D."}

(Not like you're not getting it all over china town). The tables are nicely spaced apart, and everyone isn't just squeezed together. All the food on the menu looks amazing, but if you're not sure what to get your server does have recommendation. If anything else they might just cook up something special for you. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food. Their boiled shrimp is really good. The shrimp they serve here is a bit different from the ones your can normally get from a grocery store. The shell is a bit harder, the meat firmer, and sweeter. \n\nThe vegetable is cooked very delicious. I love their bitter melon dish. My family and friends love the pickled cucumbers. I totally recommend getting a couple of them. \n\nThe fried pork and pork shank is good as well. It is lacking a bit more flavor, but if you do have left overs, you can take it back home to make congee or just reheat it up for other things. \n\nIf ordering family style is not your thing, you can definitely order the typical none traditional asian food. I've seen other people eat orange chicken and those stuff. \n\nI'd totally come back here again.", "author": "Drew R."}

The place was packed and there were a couple of other people waiting for a table. We stood there as the servers ignored us. We waited patiently for about 10 mins before being sat at a small table. Then we waited for quite awhile as the 4 servers walked back and forth but still not acknowledging us. Then a female server who looked grumpy came to our table and practically slammed our plates and chopsticks and tea cups down on our table. She did not say a word although I smiled and thanked her.\n\nWe had no idea who our server was. We saw one take the order of another table who came in after us. A male server finally took our order. We ordered chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, seafood won ton soup and lobster noodles. He rudely said we ordered too much. WTH!!! He's not the one paying!\n\nThe food came and our small table was cramped with all our plates. No one came to check on us. My friend had to ask for more water but was basically ignored. Then when the bill came, our server told us that the bill already included a tip. WOW!!! I saw that it included a 15% tip which was ridiculous due to their lack of service.

Apparently everyone in my family but me.

The salted fish with chicken was amazing... the leftovers sitting in my car on my way home.... not so much. i'm still excited about eating the left overs though. \n\nI also ordered the pork and eggplant clay pot. My grandma asked to leave out the spicy sauce (the XO sauce). It was still good without it, but I asked for some of it on the side to take with my left overs. Also delicious when added later. \n\nYou should ask about what specials/off menu items they have. I was originally going to order pea sprouts with garlic, but the waiter told us that they some other vegetable, which my grandma asked for instead. Also a winner. \n\nWe finished with their complementary red bean dessert soup.

And it was completely unplanned.  \n\nIt was our first full day on US soil, specifically San Francisco. After holy mass, breakfast at Ziggy's and a walking free-wheeling look see of Union Square and environs, we were on our way to Fisherman's Wharf for our very first pre-booked tour. We chanced upon this corner resto. Hubby/Dad wanted to check out chinese cuisine. Our 5 children and I w/ a close friend demurred. The place looked so ordinary and uneventful from outside. Hubby won, so in we went. \n\nMy heart skipped a bit and felt a sudden hope from the feel and look of the main door handles and frame- they looked and felt of good quality gold brass. \n\nWhat followed next was amazing. The food we ordered came thick, fresh and fast. Beef, pork and chicken were juicy and savory, noodles were firm and/or crispy as needed, seafood tasted fresh, delicious and light, vegetables of good quality and deftly done. And the portions, wow, generous is an understatement. \n\nAnd the last but not the least part, the price was really reasonable. And I mean it was so reasonable, it was unbelievable. To top it all, the place was quite clean, especially the restroom. Restos this cheap normally give their price as an excuse to be dowdy. Not this one. \n\nAs we ended our trip, And after several other Chinese restos from San Francisco to New York, I realize this was bang for the buck the best we went to.

I always thought this restaurant was pretty good, but with my latest visit here, I found the dishes to be phenomenally done!\n\nThe first compliment to give this restaurant compared to other restaurants in Chinatown is that it is very clean. The prices reflect that however, as the food here is quite expensive as compared to its Chinatown equivalents. \n\nEveryone knows the famous restaurant across the street, R&G Lounge. As I'm told, the chef here had some sort of connection with the chef(s) there, so the food is definitely cooked with much skill and expertise.

But more people had said to me, \"You should write a book.\" I just assumed that was also people being polite. But I do think what I'm about to tell you is a story not lived by many, and it all started here, at this restaurant, more or less. The year was 1988, I was very young, and as one of the first few high school students of the very first foreign exchange program between the two largest world economies, I arrived in this country dazed and confused. The original restauranteur, who was ultimately responsible for making this ground breaking exchange program happen since the beginning of the People's Republic, treated us five students meals here frequently, so our transition to this country was not as drastic as it would have been.  \n\nAll those Chinatown banquets and Chinese consulate dinners felt more like a magic dust to this homesick teen. She was surrounded by people who knew what these kids represented and adored them for what they also meant to them. Each gathering was filled with nostalgia and hope. For those Chinese Americans active in Chinatown, they longed for a connection to their hometowns through us; and for those Chinese diplomats in the consulate on Laguna, they saw us as for what was yet to come: the beginning of the two world's largest economies's cooperation and cultural exchange, and the great industrialization of a third world country, which took China by storm somewhat 10 years later, propelling this country of 1.2 billion people onto the world stage. It all seemed to start from here, five young kids from three different Chinese high schools, serving as an olive branch, and starting a meaningful dialogue between the two nations since Nixon.\n\nBut, it's the gathering and meals prepared here at the Garden Restaurant that introduced me to American Chinese food. I had never seen Egg Foo Young before, nor Wor Wanton Soup. The waitstaff always gave us fortune cookies, which I had not seen before coming to America. \n\nAfter twenty-some odd years later, I returned here on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant has changed ownership, but it stayed in the same family of the people who came from the region I came from; the alumni network is strong in San Francisco chinatown. The food is very similar, and you can get the lunch or the dinner menu, apparently; though we only received the lunch menu. The great man who initiated this exchange program, who had since sold the restaurant, had retired, both of his kids attended Lowell and then elite colleges. He remained active in the community. The new owner, who's been running the place since over 10 years plus ago, had reconfigured the restaurant to allow a banquet room in addition to the regular dining room. You can still order Egg Foo Young and Wor Wanton Soup. I learned all this by chatting up with a Caltran worker, who belongs to the same alumni association. He did not remember me, though he said wonderful things about the owners.\n\nThrough this simple and delicious meal, I was transported back to when I was just a skinny teen, fresh off the boat (or the plane, as the case may be),  I spoke no English, I looked every bit lost as any immigrant or refugee would feel. I did not know at the time, that I was going to embark on a brand new journey - a future unwritten, stories unformed, and a life, not yet lived.", "author": "Victoria E."}

From reading other reviews, it looks like the ownership changed in 2011, and it went more upscale.  Since I didn't know about the change, it took me a while to rediscover it.\n\nAfter the R&G Lounge, this is the best Chinese place on Kearny St.  There are no lines, and usually it's easy to get a table.  My overall rating should be 4.5 Stars.\n\nFor lunch, they have a nice selection of soups with various meats and noodles from $7-$11.  The flavor of the broth is really good.  Personally though, I usually don't get the wontons.  I'm not sure what it is; but, every time I have them, they have a different taste than I am used to.  Their flavor is not bad, just different. You should be warned that the beef stew often includes a little bit of fat and/or tendon.  But, trust me that contributes to the flavor.  When I've order it, the chicken soup always comes with white meat.\n\nTheir Deep Fried Prawns are incredible.  The batter is very light and airy.\n\nI really like the Seafood Chow Mein.  The fish they use is delicious.  I only wish the chow mein came with a few vegetables to balance the seafood and the noodles.\n\nBased on the fish in the seafood chow mein, for the first time, I had the Fish Fillet with Vegetables.  It was amazing.  It came with a really tasty light sauce, and the fish is very fresh.  The owner told me they use slices of Rock Cod in this dish.  I don't normally order fish dishes as I'm usually disappointed; but, this dish is excellent. The dish comes with American Broccoli; but, you can get it with Chinese Broccoli, or mixed Vegetables (including slices of ginger).  Though this dish is on the dinner menu, I have found that they will make it as a lunch special.  Basically, any dish made with this fish tastes good.\n\nAs much as I like the Seafood Chow Mein, my new favorite is the Seafood Chow Fun.  To me, it tastes even better than the Chow Mein.  I still wish they would throw in a few vegetables as it usually only comes with green onion.\n\nThe Pork Fried Rice is good.\nThe Mu Shu Pork is good.\nSalt & Pepper Chicken Wings are good.\n\nThe Hot & Sour soup is pretty good.\nThe Pot Stickers are pretty good. Best yet, they take a few minutes to prepare; as they should.\nThe General Tsao Chicken is pretty good.  It only comes with chili peppers and a bit of onion.\nSingapore Style Noodles are pretty good.\nMixed Mushroom, Tofu, & Chinese Green is pretty good.  The tofu is slightly fried on the outside to firm it up and has a nice flavor.  For the Greens, you can ask for American or Chinese Broccoli, or Bok Choy.  My only complaint is that sometimes the bigger pieces of sliced mushroom are undercooked and a bit hard to chew.\n\nThe Mongolian Beef was just so so.  It didn't taste as good as it looked.  The Mongolian Lamb tastes better.\nThe Egg Plant with Garlic sauce is just OK.\n\nThough I haven't tried it here, the owner tells me they always have Salt and Pepper Crab on the menu.  The price just changes during the year depending on how far they have to source them from.\n\nEverything cooked Salt and Pepper Style is pretty good; even the Tofu.\n\nI remember when the R&G Lounge was a modest place with good food and easy to get a table.  Then, the Hong Kong celebrities discovered it, they went upscale, and now they have lines of people waiting out the door every night.\n\nPart of me hopes that also doesn't happen to this place as I want to make sure I can always get a table...

A nice combination of minced beef, egg whites and cilantro. The broth was a thick consistency that I really liked.\n\nWe had lobster with green onions and ginger.  We originally ordered dungenous crab, but the waiter recommended the lobster becase they were offering a special. Two for $21 versus $29 for one crab.  I appreciated the recommendation and the lobsters (although small) were very tasty.\n\nChow fun with BBQ Pork was very good.\n\nWe had a special fried rice that is not offered on the menu. Again our waiter recommended this as an alternative to the House Fried Rice. One difference was that it included dried shrimp, and we thought it was good.\n\nThe Sweet Pea Leaves with Garlic dish was very good. Very fresh greens and the preparation did not use a lot of oil.\n\nThe Peking Pork was my least favorite of our dishes.

The staff are very accommodating in packing things to travel and were very cooperative in following my schedule to ensure the food arrives home temperature hot.

The truth is that they do make it the BEST there. It fluffy and not oily. The fried rice showcases the fire power of the stove! It's piping hot when the dish is served and you can taste all the ingredients in every spoonful of the fried rice. For those who haven't tried, you must.\n\nThe restaurant is right across from R&G.

Chow mein was a little bland and sesame chicken was just only meh.  Sesame chicken in general is one of my favorite chicken dish.  Their version is not that great.  My friend ordered their BBQ plate with BBQ pork and duck.  It was only ok as well.  \n\nService: In the beginning, it was great.  My friend and I were immediately greeted when we walked in which is a plus.  After we got our food, it kinda went downhill.  They didn't come and check on us.  When we were done eating, they didn't bring us the check.  I had to flag the waiter down.  I told the waiter \"check please\".  He said ok and grabbed our dishes away.  I thought that he would bring our check over after he put away the dishes but nope, he came back out and was doing other things.  We continued to wait another 10 minutes and still no nothing.  I flagged down another person.  I believe he was the owner.  We finally got our check.  We paid and left.\n\nOverall, this place was only ok.  I can get better Chinese food elsewhere.

It is a smaller restaurant and my banquet was about 60 people so if you have more than that, the Garden Restaurant may not work for you.\n\nThe food here is really excellent, and their Peking Duck is especially delicious.

Honey ribs, salt and pepper shrimp, fried rice, shark fins soup, mushrooms and veggies, Peking duck lettuce wraps, steamed whole fish and dessert soups. \n\nThe staff changed out the dinner plates every other course or so, provided soft drinks, let us bring in our own wine and corked it without extra charge.

It has gone up in price to $15.\n\nIn addition to the Lobster Noodle special, we also ordered their 7 Course Meal for $69 which provides soupand a choice from their high end priced items (Peking Duck, steamed whole fish, etc.), and four choices from their medium priced items.   If you are with a big group, this is a pretty good bargain.   You can fill out the meal with some well prepared items -- Peking Spareribs , chicken with black beans and asparagus,  beef with assorted mushrooms, and filet of fish with chinese broccoli (gai lan).   The dishes were all prepared well; a bit of oil but not too much, and not alot of salt so we were all pretty impressed with the flavors and freshness.    While some of the dishes are westernized for western tastes, all of the dishes were good and tasty.\n\nI think if you are looking for simple, well prepared, reasonably priced Chinese food in very clean and comfortable surroundings, then The Garden Restaurant should be a place you should consider.   I gather from other Yelp reviewers that the place recently underwent a change in ownership/management and older reviews were based on the previous regime.   If that's the case, it might explain why the service staff here were above the usual sullen (bordering on rude) service you get in alot of small Chinese restaurants.   The people who served us were friendly, energetic, and seemingly interested in serving us.   We parked in the garage in Portsmouth Square, and the restaurant does give you partly validated parking for 2 hours with a minimum purchase.\n\nI'm giving this 3 and a half stars with an extra star for the very clean environment and above average service.", "author": "Bad News S."}

I would not have tried this restaurant from the unassuming sign and outward appearance, but our group trusted the Yelp review and tried it over the recommended R&G due to long wait time. So we had salt and pepper tofu appetizer, pot stickers and vegetarian spring rolls. Delicious and wonderful light and crispy textures. Entrees were Kung Pao chicken (spicy with slight sweetness and a hint of five spice), ma Po tofu (spicy and good), and duck lettuce wraps (wow don't miss these). \nHighly recommend for others to enjoy.", "author": "Eric H."}

When I was there during the evening most of the diners seemed to fit that profile and weren't locals. The service is good and slightly formal (for Chinatown) and the ambiance is nice.\n\nThe food is mediocre. It's not that it's Americanized or somehow prepared to the lowest common denominator, it's that the talent isn't there. I had the Peking duck and stir fried beef with vegetables. The Peking duck lacked flavor. Stir fried vegetables with beef is a basic benchmark dish but it just didn't taste very good.\n\nBased on the quality of the food this restaurant should get 2 stars but deserves an extra star for the good service.", "author": "John W."}

It was lucky that we went to dine and chat in Garden Restaurant.  Our experience was GREAT.  If there is a six star rating we would be glad to do it!\n\nThe food, all the dishes we ordered were delicious.  We had not had such wonderful dishes for a long time.  Believe me, since all four of us are native Chinese.  The bill for such good food was much less than we expected, plus they gave us two dishes for free, a well cooked nutritious soup for us, and a meat bone for our dog.  Everybody smiles.\n\nWe picked this place because it is upscale, clean, and quite so we could chat pleasantly.   We didn't expect that our well behaved German Shepherd was welcomed there.  The first thing we noticed was the floor.  It was so clean that we knew our always clean shepherd could sit without a problem.  \n\nThe restaurant boss is a dog lover.  He loved our shepherd, and he loves all the dogs since he has dogs his own.  He treated the dogs like humans, and even has two rooms downstairs to make them happy.  \n\nOur dog was very quite that night.  She was contented.  She got a big piece of delicious meat bone and a taste of all our delicious food.   \n\nWe don't go to SF that often, but we thought we found a treasure in SF.  Anytime later we go to SF this is our restaurant!\n\nDid I forget to mention that this restaurant is also super conveniently located:  It is just across the China Town's only big parking lot, Garden Parking, and you will get a two hours valid parking from this restaurant.", "author": "Shawna S."}

There was no crab present!  Just deep fried won ton wrappers filled with cream cheese.  And they give you about 2 tablespoons of sauce... so be sure to use sparingly! ;-)\n~ Honey BBQ Pork was as much meat as it was fat and gristle! Yuk.\n~ Pork Fried Rice was bland, and the pork/egg had a strange flavor/smell\n~ Hong Kong Style Beef Chow Fun was HORRIBLE!  It was like they marinated the noodles in oil overnight, and then cooked them in a vat of oil.  The dish was so oil laden and COMPLETELY TASTELESS, I had two bites (first one... terrible, second one... just to make sure!) ;-)  Then I tried to pawn off on my husband, who will generally eat just about ANYTHING... and that was a no-go!  He had one bite... and pushed it away.  We just left it for the waiter to pickup and throw away.  When he asked us if we liked it, we told him that we didn't -- as it was saturated in oil and had no flavor... he just laughed.  THAT was annoying!\n\nWith so many amazing places to eat in Chinatown, I would NOT recommend this one.

They worked really hard and deserved a delicious meal. Everyone agreed on Chinese Food. I really had no idea of where to go as most Chinese restaurants have really dirty carpeting, dirty bathrooms and that is unappealing when eating. \n\nSomehow, I spotted THE GARDEN RESTAURANT and we wandered in. My mouth dropped as the decor was NOT CHINESE style. It was .hip, minimalist bistro! I was astounded as the main wall was covered with brushed stainless wine holders with real bottles of wine. The colors were a rich and warm brown with a mellow golden mustard accent. The wood pillars are the same rich brown as are the booths. We could have sat in the dining room with round tables but opted for a spacious booth. \n\nWe perused the menu and i ordered something special and the women were all happy with what was ordered. We had Honey Walnut Prawns as an appetizer and I was truly impressed with the beautifully carved carrot phoenix bird. It was a small masterpiece of golden carrot, so delicately rendered. What amazed me we were in an unknown Chinese restaurant, not a white table cloth establishment. Its beauty added to \nour enjoyment of the delicious dish ~ the walnuts were coated with a honey glaze, they were crisp and crunchy with the added toasted sesame seeds. Basically we swooned and were really impressed with the dish. \n\nWhen we were served the roast duck we got Eye Candy once again, it was from eating the beautifully presented dish as well as THE TASTE ~ WOW!!!! It was the best we had ever eaten. Asparagus was in season as it was April 15th and they at their prime. The prep was minimalist, just a bit of sesame oil and perfectly cooked and seasoned, we basically had to restrain ourselves from eating more than our fair share.

I always eat here when I'm staying at the Hilton, which is right next door. I sometimes order to go and bring the food back up to my room. I've tried a range of things from the menu, but I like their noodle dishes the best. The beef chow mein is especially good.\n\nAlthough it's not as upscale as R&G and some of the fancier places on Kearny, it's generally faster, a bit quieter, and less crowded. The food comes out quickly and I've never had to wait to be seated.\n\nIf you are staying at the Hilton and want a good, convenient dinner, you should definitely give the Garden a try.", "author": "Ryan P."}

The white paper-as-table-cloths were gone, the Asian decor had become walls decorated with numerous bottles of wine sitting on modern looking wall racks. We walked in and the two of us were seated at a large booth. It was so large that we ended up sitting on the same side.\n\nThe Garden Restaurant's lobster noodles (with the wide flat noodles, not the skinny ones) is a favorite of my SO and it was his suggestion for the night that brought us here... But once we went in, we discovered that there wasn't any type of lobster noodles listed on the menu nor on the the chalkboard sign outside the restaurant door where I saw it written the last time we came for lobster noodles here. Not to fear, the waitress indicated that they still made them. Since I was craving something hot, we also added an order of crab meat soup, which neither of us had tried before. The waitress nodded and smiled as she took our order, advised us that the soup came in a medium size, then walked away, coming back with two empty bowls and serving spoons for our soup.\n\nThen came the weird part. Shortly after another waitress came up and asked what kind of noodles would we like in the lobster soup. Huh? I tried to explain that we didn't order lobster soup, we ordered lobster noodles and crab meat soup, but she seemed to become more confused before yelling back at our original waitress in Cantonese. Finally, she asked us to please give her our order again so she could write it down. She left looking a bit upset, then returned again only to take back the two bowls and the serving spoons that the other waitress had placed on our table. \n\nWhen our soup came (and it was more a large size than a medium), it was our original waitress who brought it to our table, started speaking unintelligibly, neither in English, nor Cantonese, nor Mandarin, and then - upon discovering that we no longer had bowls and serving spoons - became upset and walked back to the other waitress, speaking angrily the whole time. Perhaps they could work on their communication next time...?\n\nOtherwise the lobster noodles were good as usual - we always enjoy savoring the large chunks of lobster meat - and I really liked the crab meat soup although the SO thought it was bland and proceeded to adjust his portions with salt. Although instead of the house special crab meat soup we pointed to on the menu, I think they brought us the fish maw and crab meat soup - but the SO didn't notice and I wasn't going to make a big deal of it. \n\nIt all came out to $27, which is not bad for a whole lobster with noodles and a large bowl of soup for 2. When we asked for the check, our original waitress handed us the bill and started speaking unintelligibly again, but while we thought it strange, we ignored it as we were already on our way out after paying and needed to catch a bus. \n\nWe'll definitely be returning as the lobster noodles are as good as ever, however we will be more aware of waitresses muttering unintelligible things at us and the not-so-good communication with each other over what was ordered.", "author": "Jali D."}

I said scored!  Went in, sat down and ordered without even looking at the menu, thinking, \"they can't screw up on this common dish right?\"\n\nThe dish came pretty quick and it was ok.  The noodles were thin and on the chewy side, which probably meant the noodles weren't fresh.  After I scarfed down the food, the tall male waiter handed me a bill for $6.95 plus tax which totaled $7.54.  I asked him about the discrepancy and he said my dish is not the special for the day.  I showed him the sign in front and he said only the two signs \"directly\" in front of the restaurant showed the correct specials and prices.  It didn't make any sense to me at all and I didn't want to argue over 2 bucks so I just told him not to put the other sign out as it was confusing.  He said thank you and took my money.\n\nI know, I know, I probably should've asked about the price first before ordering.

I asked the waiter about the missing noodles, he apologized and went back to the kitchen to ask them to make a bowl of noddles. I was half way through my wonton when he realized no one brought me the bowl of noodles. Waited so long for mediocre food.

The crab itself is cooked perfectly, not overdone and chewy.\nThey also serve the crab.. head innards.  Also deep fried, but not encrusted in batter, so the taste is still there.\n\nThe deep fried flounder is also very good here; very crispy, not burnt, and the meat was perfect; not overdone and chewy, but melts in your mouth.\n\nIf you're a meat lover, try the Wintermelon Soft Boiled Lamb Stew Hot Pot.\nThe Lamb is deliciously juicy, tender, tendons were soft, and the Wintermelon is hot and soft.  The soup it's being cooked in is pretty delicious too.\n\nI don't remember the menu, but it had quite a selection of other choices, but these were the restaurant-brand-name dishes.\n\nI'd have to say the first impression upon entering the restaurant, it seemed designed for smaller parties.  The center of the restaurant was designed for many parties of 4 sitting arrangements.\nHowever, they do have 6 tables toward the back of the restaurant that seat parties from 10~15 people.\nI would say it's not a very popular restaurant yet because they've recently switched owners.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant isn't typical for an Asian restaurant, it's very clean, not commonly seen in many restaurants around Chinatown.  Even the restrooms are kept clean, and free of water spills.\n\nThe service is what's expected of Chinese-style restaurants, the waiters only come to you when your food's ready, or if you flag them down.  They're constantly moving around, but it's still a lot easier to get serviced than at other bigger restaurants.

If I  didn't know what real Chinese tasted like, perhaps they would get more stars.  Had crab rangoon appetizer - overly fried, garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) - bland, and chicken chao fen - bland.  It was edible (unlike Yan's Kitchen), but mamahuhu at best.", "author": "N P."}

The old Garden restaurant had pretty good Cantonese dishes.  Reliable chow mein, chow fun, and Yee Foo won ton.  Now, the chefs must not be Chinese.  Once we ordered Tomato Beef Chow Mein and got beef chow mein with sliced tomatoes.  What the ...!  It is on the menu and we ordered it in English and Chinese and got this strange looking I-have-never-cooked-Chinese-food dish.  The Hom Yhee Gai Nup Faan was like plain fried rice.  This place is across from Portsmouth Square, dead center Chinatown.  Let the tourist eat here.  They don't know the difference from Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghai, or Panda Express.", "author": "Michael N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-03", "description": "One of the very few places near the Financial District that serves breakfast at lunch.  Mama's this is not; in fact, the breakfast here is pretty similar to what I would be able to make at home.  But that's beside the point.  Sometime you just want breakfast for lunch, even if it's made with non-organic eggs, non-applewood smoked bacon, non-freshly grated hash browns, and non-homemade bread.\n\nThis is also a good spot if you're in the mood for cheap Chinese food (like when you see a Panda Express in the airport, and you think, \"I needs to get me some of that\"), but you want a step above from that place that sells three items and soup for $4.62 (admittedly, I still rock that joint once in a while).  The salt and pepper spareribs are surprisinly good (probably because they are super fatty), as are their dumplings and fried rice.  The egg rolls pretty much suck, however.", "author": "David C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-08", "description": "I went there with a big group of 13 and had a very good experience.  The service and the food left nothing to be desired. The seafood dishes were very well prepared, not cooked in a lot of greese and fat like typical chinese restraunts.  The menu although traditionally chinese in many ways, had a distinct style that not only was satisfying (as an american person), but made me feel like the new boss has really taken strong ownership of the menu.  One of the high-lights for me was the Roast Duck, definetly a must order.  The decor was clean and we were treated with exceptional hospitality.", "author": "adele m."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-10-23", "description": "Absolutely disgusting. Definitely the worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life. I had the vegetable egg rolls. Greasy and bland and mushy inside, served with a horrific fluorescent sauce of some sort. Also had the Mao Po Tofu rice plate. Inedible. This is supposed to be a nice, spicy dish. The waiter said it had veggies with it. What I got was a plate of slimy tofu with FROZEN VEGETABLES (like those horrible little cubed carrots and peas, along with another overcooked, slimy unidentifiable vegetable that may have been a pepper). It was served in a gross, gelatinous, bland brown gravy. Spice (a defining feature of the dish) came from some jalapenos that they had thrown in. It was served with a side of just okay rice. Ugh, I could barely look at it let alone eat it. I had like 3 bites, then told them what I thought. They took it away and were barely apologetic (although the waiter did kind of laugh at my expectation that they would have fresh veggies). Of course they charged me full price. They also advertised vegetarian plates, but they were served with soup with pork. No vegetarian option for the soup, no offer to substitute, no discount. Worst dining experience in recent memory. Stay away.", "author": "Sarah C."}

I realize it was a little crazy because we went in during the Chinese New Year Parade and we were prepared to be patient. But we were sitting here for maybe 30 seconds before the waitress came by and asked if we were ready to order. We had not even gotten menus yet. So we asked for some and she seemed annoyed. At least 3 different waiters came back in the next 4 minutes to ask if we were ready and we had to keep telling them to give us a sec. At one point, my friend lost her phone and asked some of the waiters and at the register if someone had turned in a phone. They were completely rude to her and ignored her to the point that my friend (the nicest, happiest person I have ever met) had to yell \"It's not a stupid question!\". They finally brought us the bill and we were sitting right next to the register and in a hurry to leave so I took it up there but she ignored me for a full five minutes, not even making eye contact with me. When my friend went up and finally paid, they overcharged us a couple dollars. So we decided to hang out, just to make them mad and we were still trying to find my friend's phone, and sat in the booth for a while. When we did get up to leave, a lady chased us out the door claiming that we didn't pay. I have never received such horrible service or been so mistreated by a place in my life. \n\nThe food was mediocre. I felt like it might as well have been Panda Express, except the portions weren't as big. \n\nAvoid at all costs.", "author": "Kelsey R."}

I like the pancakes but I've been ordering the cheese omelet, which comes with hash browns and toast and is quite filling! At $5.50 it's a pretty good deal, too. The only gripe I have about this place is a tiny glass of OJ costs near $2, which seems like kind of a rip-off but it's still damn good OJ (is it fresh squeezed or what?!)
