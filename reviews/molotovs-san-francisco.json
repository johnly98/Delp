Any dive bar, really, but this one in particular has  cheap, strong drinks, good bartenders,  loud music to my liking, PINBALL (always extra points in my book), and is generally devoid of \"bros\" of any kind (Marina or otherwise). When all the other dives in town are dying and making way for bougie \"lounges\" (rest in peace, Kimo's) serving $14 cocktails and people who will buy them because they don't know any better, I'm glad i can count on good ol' Molotov's to just be a straight up good place to have a bullshit-free Friday night and a strong drink.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-07", "description": "Everyone complaining about the staff has zero sense of humor, no comprehension of a real dive bar, and seems to be very sheltered. \"A scary-looking crowd\"?? If you consider dogs and a bearded local old man playing chess by himself scary. \n\nI come to this bar BECAUSE of the staff. If you stop acting like an entitled infant, you'd find they are all genuine people and interesting to talk to. Anyone complaining about them has clearly never worked a service job and probably never tips- Are you expecting a personal, motherly cheerleader when you order a drink from a local dive bar, from bartenders with decades of experience, who have seen hundreds of people in all states of inebriation come and go? Do you need freshly imported orchid flowers and a bartender who thinks he's a chemist and performs fancy tricks for you? Then go somewhere in the FiDi or Marina. Even better, Vegas. This is a dive bar.\n\n\nIf you want pretentious, fake staff that sucks up to everyone (guess what- they're only being \"nice\" to get a bigger tip from you. as much as you want to feel special), if you want your hand to be held, if you misunderstand a remark and instead of talking it out with the staff, you post a passive aggressive whiny yelp review, go to touristy bars and sterile lounges in SF. There are PLENTY. \n\nI've frequented this bar for years because it DOESN'T feel like a manufactured zoo with mute bartenders numbly serving person #57 of the night like a factory line until their shift finally ends, complete with perfectly placed dime-a-dozen modern \"fancy\" or \"nice\" interior design. That is NOT a dive bar.\n\nI've come here with friends but this is also a  great dive you can come to alone and unwind, maybe pet a dog. Nobody is frontin and tryin to act cool and secretly judge one another. Everyone is here relaxing from a hard work day with alcohol, a pool table, and classic tunes. \n\nIn the real world, not everyone will act like your mommy or daddy. Don't expect a local dive bar to be a daycare center. Don't immediately be shocked and outraged because a bartender isn't politically correct. \n\nAlso this bar is not racist.. As a minority I can confirm after years of patronage vs. the one guy who came here once... who happens to be white. \n\nOverall, Molotov's is an authentic, refreshingly unpretentious, truly local dive bar- complete with unpretentious prices. Sometimes, sheltered people wander in and expect it to be a fancy Vegas lounge located in The Wynn Encore. \n\nIdeally, Yelp should be a place one can find intelligent, well-rounded reviews and not a place to snitch because your feelings were hurt- leading to an emotionally biased review.\n\nLeave Molotov's alone. How can anyone think a bar that has CUTE DOGS as REGULARS is offensive and scummy? The dogs are relaxed... and you should be too.", "author": "Hunter H."}

My friend KC told me what happened at Molotov's.\n\nSorry being out of touch for the last month or two.

As I did, I looked behind me to make sure no one saw how clumsy I was. And there She was. A lady standing about 12-15 feet behind me peering at me through her Google Glass. The light was on so I knew I was \"On the Air.\" Or at least my backside was. \n\nSo I asked the fair maiden, \"Did you get a good shot of my good side?\"\n\nShe simply giggled like a little 15 year old girl and said \"OMG, It was totally Crackalicious.\"\n\nI said \"Crackawho?\"\n\nAnd of course she giggled some more.\n\nSo I said, \"You know, even though you act like a 15 year old, you look much older or else you would not be in this place.\" I continued to let her know that she did not have to go through all this trouble in buying Google Glass.

Does a person need to bring a W-2 to get an honest price around here?  \n\nMy first visit: I got two martinis for $10 (well gin; no hassle).  One week later: I ordered two martinis (well gin).  This time I get sized up (the up-down look), and then get charged $12.  Same bartender, same day of the week, same time of night.  Like a polite person, I tipped him anyways. Stupid! Why do I forget that tips are to reward good service?  The only difference was probably what I was wearing.  Last week - jeans, black coat, minimal makeup.  Tonight - red lipstick and trench. Could I have possibly cleaned up better than last time? After I let the situation stew for a minute, I realized I could have called him out right then or called him out later that night.  Or be passive aggressive and do it on yelp.  I obviously chose the latter.  The former, I admit, would have been ideal.\n\nIt's too bad this $2 incident has bittered my opinion of this place because it appeals to my punk rock sensibility (we can save that for a later conversation).  The crowd is laid back; the music isn't so loud that you can't have a conversation; the bar is dog friendly; the drinks are cheap (even when they're tacking on a couple bucks because you look bourgeois).  Plus, my friend thinks it might be her new favorite bar. In spite of all those positive aspects, I gave it two stars (\"Meh. I've experienced better.\").  It's more important that employees are straight with me. And when I get screwed over some perceived looks tax, my enthusiasm to support the establishment is likely to wane.  It's one thing to give a good price because you're a regular. It's another to charge you based on whether the bartender thinks you can spare that extra $ and not notice.  \n\nWell, I noticed, and I'm not coming back of my own free will.

My girlfriend and I are like 11 hours into out last day in SFO and we've been walking all over, miles on foot.  We decide to head down Haight out of the park and what do we stumble into?  \n\nWalking past Molotov's the first thing I noticed was Monster Bash pinball, a favorite game of mine while in college in Oregon, it's no Mideival Madness, but it's pretty awesome.\n\nIt was about 5pm on a weekday and the place was starting to pack up with a happy hour crowd.  Most people in there were somewhat hipster with a bit of a metal vibe thrown in, lots of fixed gear bikes out front and sleeve tattoos inside.  \n\nI walked up to the bar with a clear look like I didn't really fit in and visibly stoked for pinball.  I got a PBR on tap for only $2 on the their happy hour prices, first bonus, the bartender was kind of cute with that \"somebody farted\" look on her face.  I was immediately summed up by this bartender as not quite cool enough to be in this place, which I probaly wasn't, tourist suitcase on my back, and *gasp* a collared shirt?  I had no tattoos, no ironic moustache, no skinny jeans, no v-neck sweater, how dare I, how dare I indeed?   I did my best to fit in by smoking a Parliament outside and ordering a PBR didn't I?  Her only response to my excitement about pinball was, \"yeah, have fun with that\".  I can't really blame her I guess.  The table next to ours looked to be full of guys she knew all drinking PBR long neck bottles with practiced looks of subtle ennui.  \n\nAll I was looking for was a quick game of pinball with my girlfriend and a cold beer to allow me to stay and play.  I found both at Molotov's and it made me happy.  I definitely felt the vibe that I was too square to be in this place but I didn't really mind.  For a $2 beer and some pinball it is a small price to pay.  I'd say I would go back again and give it another try, but I don't live in SFO.

The fact that the people seemed to all know each other made it seem all the better, there was a familiar friendly atmosphere. We were treated very well. The pub was clean & smelled nice (to be fair one of the days we were there was 4/20 so the smell of patchouli permeated the air, but i like that). It was clean & nicely laid out. Good bathrooms .

I think I already told you about that.  But they also replaced The Creature from the Black Lagoon with Avatar.  I don't know how much I'll be playing Avatar, but having a newer pinball machine right next to Medieval Madness means all the Molotov's newbies will be drawn to Avatar and let me play MM in peace.\n\nOK, that's not necessarily true, as yesterday (who knew it was wear-a-Christmas-outfit Saturday?) the place was crammed with drunken idiots at 5 p.m.  I was playing MM; and the group of idiots that had stupidly taken up the spot located conveniently between a column, the ATM, and the pinball machines even though there was plenty of space in the bar were seriously interfering with my pinball-playing.  I can understand accidentally bumping into someone in a crowded bar now and then, but it wasn't that full, and this guy was basically leaning against the pinball machine even though he knew I was playing it.  Every few minutes or so, he would lean back all the way, and I wouldn't be able to play because his butt--literally--had pinned my right hand to the side of the machine.  Asking him to give me room worked, but he didn't apologize, ever, even though he repeated this jerk move at least five times.\n\nOh, and his friend kept putting his hand on the glass, partially obscuring my view and altering my play.  Why?  I have no idea.  Would you ever lean up against or put your hand on a pool table while people were playing pool?  The answer is no.  So why would you do it when someone is playing pinball?\n\nBut none of this is the fault of Molotov's, and the cute bartender is so sweet.  She's always going above and beyond the call of duty, and although I tip well when I buy something, I don't think I've given her nearly enough--money, credit, the affirmation she deserves.  When I learn her name, I'll add it to this review.\n\nUPDATE:  3/25/11\n==============\n\nMolotov's is a pinball dream come true once again.  They've replaced Avatar with Scared Stiff.  In case you didn't know, Scared Stiff is the machine I learned my basic pinball skills on in 1997.  And remember, if you're going to play both Scared Stiff and Medieval Madness, play them in that order.  You'll do horribly if you go the other way around.", "author": "John S."}

I am a very irresponsible drinker and I honestly could care less. The problem is that places like Molotov's, with their 3 dollar shots of tequila and $2 PBRs, are just setting themselves up for drunken debauchery such as very loud, obnoxious...your my best friend/I hate you type behavior. Plain and simple.\n\nNot only that, but that jukebox... One of my favorites in the city. Everything from Guns N Roses to the Ramones to Pantera to Mike Patton to whatever the hell floats your boat, unless you are a Backstreet Boy loving freak of nature (this is the nice way of saying you wouldn't fit in very well at this bar). Therefore...\n\nMixing tequila and hearing music where the entire bar constantly is hearing you saying (screaming) \"That's my song!\" as you walk by hugging everybody is a pretty good indicator that you will wake up the next morning saying...what the fuck happened??

If you're craving a tripel brewed by trappist monks in a cave in Wallonia head to Toronado, and if you want to listen to a live DJ while sitting in a nightmarish circus tent then you'll want to go to Noc Noc, but otherwise Molotov's isn't a bad place to start.\n\nSomething about the place rubs me wrong but I'm pretty sure it's just me.

I assumed that nothing of interest could be more than a few blocks from a subway stop (surface transit didn't count). But much of the good stuff in SF is clustered in neighborhoods away from the transit hubs, and away from all the places that casual tunnel travelers would see without one or two Muni transfers. Sometime around 2002, I started spending time in the Lower Haight, and stuck around as a regular visitor for about four years. \n\nAfter the demise of An Bodhran, Molotov's and Toronado are what hold my interest. Despite other comments to the contrary, I've always found this place to be rather friendly. Pleasant bar staff, reasonably quick service, moderate prices, functional restrooms with no lines, non-aggro clientele (except the one time I had to help mediate a fight between amputees--but hey, it's still the Lower Haight). A visit for Friday's DYL confirmed that, despite changes in the neighborhood (some for the better, some for the worse because they're for the better), the overall experience is still the same. If they could only flush the tap lines a bit more...\n\nOne of the best things about the gentrification of the Lower Haight is the humor in watching the younger, overcoiffed/business-casual folks (non-Yelpers!) walk into a not-so-divey dive bar like Moly's and do the look-around-fold-arms-pull-bag-in-close thing like it's a seriously edgy place.

The drinks are standard dive bar, you get them to get drunk then hang out with your friends. I'm sorry, there's no real science behind it. Though a few dudes did get flaming shots, which are more fun to the eye than the taste buds, but I digress.\n\nThe reason I've recently discovered I love Molotov's is because of its outstanding jukebox, keeps me entertained and always wanting more. Features a few good punk mixes along with Subhumans, Void, Nina Simone, The Germs, N.W.A, Wu-Tang, Peter and the Test Tube Babies, I could go on, but you get the point. Fun, party jams.\n\n I know, I know-if it's only the music I care about, I should just drink for cheap at my house while listening to my record player/Ipod, but if I stayed home, I'd never meet that man with carved wooden sticks or that ex-raver, current powerpuff girl 50-year-old cougar in fluffy boots.

My boyfriend and I went to check out the place, being big fans of the dive bar, and play some pinball.  I should have known when walking in that my pants weren't tight and black enough for this joint.  So after the 21 year old bartender stopped pretending to ignore us while acting important, we got some beers and played a few games of pinball.  We sat at the bar for a bit watching someone get killed in one of the Halloween movies playing above the bar.  When one of the pinball machines was free, we went over to play another game and put some money in the machine.\nHere comes the good part... out of nowhere comes the Ozzy Osbourne wannabe with oh so tight pants and very carefully styled hair that was trying very hard to make a statement.  He got in my boyfriends face and informed him in the nicest of language that he was using the pinball machine.  I guess when he was outside having a cigarette he was \"using\" it.  Maybe he should have carved his name on the Lord of the Rings pinball machine with the switchblade I'm sure he had in his pocket.  Or maybe I should give the guy a break because he obviously just really loved his Frodo.\nSo I did something I've never done and got between this guy and my guy because I thought Ozzy may actually throw a punch over pinball and we're not exactly the types to get in a bar brawl.  For the first time in my life I felt like I might get hit (or stabbed) by a man.  So we walked away as young important feeling bartender stated repeatedly \"He's a regular, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.\"  Now... I understand the importance of respecting your regulars, but you might want to re-evaluate the ones who are picking fights over pinball.  It's a game, does it really make you that angry?  Or maybe the regulars are really all they have at the end of the day when they've scared everyone away.", "author": "Erin D."}

There were quite a few youngsters that probably don't know who the fuck Joy Division is/was, and if they do, they have no idea that JD didn't look \"punk\" because they created punk and didn't need to look like anything.....as in, it's an attitude, not a look......EMO fools.\n2.

Then I watched as one of them repeatedly failed at opening his Corona with a Bic lighter. Watching both drunks was akin to watching a national geographic animal show. The way they had found their sustenance but could not figure out how to get to it. Another observer finally hailed a cab and poured both the drunks in and ended my entertainment.

The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in any dive in the city, usually void of any current \"top 40\" shit, but yet still diverse and surprising (going from playing Discharge to Hank Williams Sr. to old-school gangsta rap in a span of ten minutes).  The bartenders are all cool folks who will chat with you if you sit at the bar counter, and they usually have a good movie playing on the tv. It's a tad dark inside, which is a plus for those who often go on dive bar expeditions alone. The drink prices are pretty good, and there is a special on bottled PBR all day ($2). The location on Lower Haight can't be beat - there's a taqueria, a pizza place, and a deli across the street to satisfy those late-night drunk munchies, and usually no drugged-up asshole squatters to harass you for money outside the bar - they usually remain on upper Haight from Cole St. on over.
