Gay guy here, stopping by this busy straight bar close to my house because I wanted a nightcap and I hear they have some good beers on tap.\n\nIt's busy, so I go to the back end of the bar, only one girl ahead of me at the service area.  Perfect, minimal wait while she gets her drink.  But she's chatting up the bartender.  I think, \"that's fine, girls are why everyone is here.\"  Except I wait, and wait, and wait.  They chat, and chat, and chat.\n\nFinally, after about 5 minutes another bartender comes by, takes my drink order (the pale ale on tap) and I give him a $20 (I'd just gone to the ATM and had a single $1 and 5 $20 bills).  He comes back, gives me $4 and runs to the other end of the bar.\n\nWell, then.  I stand there looking at my $4 thinking, either:  1) paid $16 for a glass of beer, 2) he thought I'd given him a $10 and then ran off before I could ask, or 3) he ripped me off.  I'm guessing it's number 3, but willing to discuss #1 or #2.\n\nI wait, try to make eye contact and ask about pricing, and kill time by drinking my $16 glass of pale ale.  Never able to get his attention.  I stayed in the same spot, and tried to get his attention for 20 minutes or so, no luck.\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of couples come back to the service area where I'm waiting (fruitlessly) to see about my beer charge. One of the men tries to get the bartender (who's chatting with a friend) to serve him. Too bad for him; he waits several minutes while the bartender has a few laughs with his friend before he acknowledges the customer and takes his drink orders. I take a bit of cold comfort that I'm not the only one who had to wait, and I hope they don't get overcharged.\n\nMaybe all of that's normal at Harper & Rye (I don't spend a lot of time at straight bars), but I don't have any plans to go back, ever.", "author": "Andrew M."}

She called the bouncer \n(Who was apologetic but obviously at her mercy), and I asked him and her to disclose her name - she would not give it to me. Asked to speak to the manager - she said she was it. She threatened to call the cops - which i told her i was ok with since i was sober and adequate to talk to. Plus my friends were witnessing the whole thing. She got combative and started yelling that we had to leave. She then began grabbing my friends' drinks from their hands and saying no one was welcome anymore and that she would have the cops drag us out.

Saw this place and decided it looked like a great place to hang out. I walked in and counted 4 people inside the bar.. that included me and the bartender. Not a big deal since they were just open for a couple hours and its mid-week. \nThe bartender was a tall scruffy guy that came right over to ask what I wanted. He quickly helped narrow down the type of beer I was looking for and served it up quick, wet, and cold. I like talking with bartenders but I felt he was unapproachable unless you were family or a friend. What a coincidence a friend of his walked in soon after that. It's crazy how his personality changed in a matter of a few minutes. Okay, that's cool. \nI sat there with my beer and watched TV while they caught up on things. Just a bit bored sitting there with the bartender completely engaged with his friend. In my defense I'm not the kinda guy who requires a lot of attention or medication that keeps me from spazzing out. Just the opposite. I had time to kill and wanted to have a couple beers and know more about the bar and its contents rather than learning about it from a google search on my phone... while sitting at the bar.\nI was finishing up on my first beer when two women walked in. The bartender asked them what they wanted and I noticed he went back to the same unapproachable vibe he had before his friend walked in. One of the girls asked a simple question \"what's good here\". To my surprise the bartender without a wink, smile, smirk, or indication he was having  fun with them replied \"everything\". Okay, DUDE! I get you maybe having a bad day but two young, cute, happy, girls walk into your bar and you give them attitude and a stupid reply. You have any idea how may places would kill to have those girls walk into their establishment for a drink or two and maybe call their friends to come join them?! \nSo that kinda killed it for me. It killed my desire for conversation and a second beer.\n\nTo be fair I will go back because I think the bar was done right and looks like a great place to hang out. I'm praying the bartender was just having a bad day.", "author": "Kyle G."}

I've been going for months and have never had a problem with the guys that work there. They know their craft well and put up with a TON of crap from a lot of people. \n\nI have examples for days. Let's talk facts:\n\nFACT: One of the guys, blonde-ish, puts up with constant harassment from marina girls who shout his name over and over and over, almost exactly like the seagulls in Finding Nemo (\"Mine! mine!\"). They get butt-hurt b/c he doesn't flirt back. He's nice to them but treats them like everyone else and doesn't linger while they try to flutter their eyes. HOW DARE HE continue working. What. A. Dick.\n\nFACT: the bros talk to them like servants. No manners whatsoever. You, with the pastel polo and pinky up while you drink--dont shout at them, wave your money, snap your fingers. Know what you want to order, pay and SURPRISE! Good service. \n\nFACT: This place is often packed. So many people are complaining about waiting to order a drink. Are you kidding me?! Not sure what you're used to but where I go, magic hasn't been invented yet. When you're one of hundreds, you're gonna wait. You're calling them inattentive when what actually is going on is that they're paying attention to others there before you. \n\nFACT: Its easier to get an accurate number of drinks made and charged if you accurately tell them how many instead of slurring and stammering through placing an order, and waiting to correct them until the end.\n\nFACT: Just because you know someone who was born doesn't mean you get free things in life. Bitter pill to swallow, I know. Stop getting upset when whining, \"its my friend's birthday!\" doesn't work.\n\nFACT: The \"rude\" quotes people provide from them are actually called JOKES. If you can't sense sarcasm and took them seriously you're an idiot. Thats how bartenders are. You won't choke if you banter back with them. \n\nBottom line: The workers are friendly, very professional, and hilarious.

The interior design is pretty cool. There's plenty of seating (upstairs and downstairs), an area with a pool table, and a nice long bar at the center of it all. However, there's something strangely cold about the place (both literally and spiritually). When I came in the other evening, it was pouring rain outside. And for some reason, they left the front door wide open, which carried in quite a chilly breeze. We didn't want to make a fuss about it, so my friend and I just moved to the back of the bar to escape the chill factor. But still, it was kind of odd that no one thought to turn the heat on, or at the very least, close the damn door. It's not fun to sip on drinks while you're shivering.\n\nIn any case, we looked at the cocktail menu. They had some interesting selections. This is clearly a Mixologist kind of bar, and not a dive bar. I was almost tempted to order this specialty cocktail with tequila and ginger beer. But when it's cold outside, my palate leans more towards bourbon. So I wound up getting the Manhatten with Maker's Mark. The bartenders here clearly know what they're doing. I watched as the bartender took his time creating my libation. He first started with one of those gigantic ice cubes (that never melt), and then he carefully poured in the bourbon and sweet vermouth, before finishing it off with some bitters. After stirring the ingredients for a bit, his masterpiece was complete. It was definitely one of the better Manhattens I've had in a while. Granted, at $12 per pop, it wasn't exactly cheap. But there was no denying that it was delicious. On a personal note, I'd love to see them offer some sort of happy hour in the near future. We ordered two drinks each, and the bill wound up being $50 (not counting tip). Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. But if you're looking to get tipsy on the cheap, then this isn't the place for you.\n\nAll in all, Harper & Rye is a solid bar and a classy addition to the neighborhood. I'd definitely come back if I was in the area. The drinks are good. And the location is central. I just wish the place had a warmer, more inviting vibe to it.", "author": "Kevin B."}

We went on a Thursday night around 10:30pm and while it was moderately crowded inside there was no outside line as many have written about so we walked right in.  \n\nThe moment I walked in I was a little disappointed to find it felt like a regular old hipster bar. Don't get me wrong its nice inside, but based on how it looked from the outside I kind of created this image in my head of a beautiful bar with dimmed lighting and stunningly beautiful people.  \n\nThere was no wait at the bar and we received our drinks about 3-4 minutes after ordering them.

As a bartender, barman, mixologist, or whatever you want to call yourself working behind a bar, a HUGE part of your job is to create ambiance.  Very Short Blond Guy Behind the Bar at Harper and Rye, do you know what sort of ambiance you created for me in that short exchange?  Think about it- I have, and I'll never come back.  I bought a drink from you and it was tasty- something with carrot juice and mezcal(how cliche-mixologist of you), and I even tipped you $2.  I'll concede that the drink was worth it, but that was a waste of my $2, and I'm still kicking myself for not leaving after our exchange.  \n\nThe drinks here are good, from what I experienced in the one drink I had.

I arrived and all went well; got some drinks, met some nice people, the usual. Drama started when a server walked by and tripped, spilling the majority of drinks all over me. He said \"Oh... Sorry.\" I went to the bouncer, and he was very sweet and apologetic. I decided to let the incident go... Until I heard a loud, distinctive crash. A wine glass had broken, and the most dangerous part, the stem, slid towards us. I saw it before my friend stepped on it. I went to see the manager, Jake. The nice bartender was appalled at the glass stem I held in my hand, but warned me not to be \"emotional\" with the manager. This seemed odd to me, but made sense a minute later. There was another man waiting, too. He was angry that he'd stepped on glass and it had pierced the sole of his shoe. I did not know him at all, but I watched, as Jake met with him first. I was so utterly shocked at what unfolded. The man was clearly angry, and had no solution in mind. He wanted justice, or at least acknowledgment that he had been wronged. He never got this, because the manager only argued with him for five to ten minutes about why the man was stupid for thinking anyone would care about his complaint. Who would believe him? Who would advocate for him? Who would care? I watched as the manager cut him apart, bit by bit. I'd seen this kind of arguing before--- the law school kind. I reasoned he was a 2L at best. The patron was stupid for settling-- he got his bar tab comp'd, but for me, this went far beyond that. This manager disregarded safety, common sense, and basic human dignity. I was completely disregarded after my entire shirt and jacket were soaked with God knows what. A glass broke and went completely ignored. Then, when it came to accountability, the manager could only scoff and laugh the ENTIRE way through. Well, hats off to you, Jake.

Drinks are mid-range on price, but taste great.  A unique spot for Polk, but relatively par for the course for the larger SF area.\n\nI feel like this is a great happy hour spot.  After that it seems to get packed which is fine but the music and space sometimes are a mismatch if you want to dance and get a little looser.  Early evening this spot provides an atmosphere not the usual on Polk and is a lot of fun for sipping strong drinks with friends while enjoying a conversation and deciding where the evening will go.  The upstairs tables provide for a little more intimate setting while the downstairs open floor plan allows for a lot of mingling.  If you're lucky enough to snag the lounge area downstairs then you are set.  When it is not packed the drink service is at a great pace and usually you can get yourself to the bar.  As the night goes on getting a drink can be a daunting task, but then again that's becoming par for the course at a lot of spots around the city.  Bottom line is the drinks are well made, delicious, strong, and are served in a comfortable feeling spot that is great as the neighborhood go to for early evening drinks with friends.", "author": "Greg M."}
