My top 3 were:\n\nSalted Caramel: You get that aftertaste of salt that compliments the sweetness of the caramel custard. \n\nVanilla: Very simple but delicious. Reminds me of a Beard Papa.\n\nCreme Brulee Financier: This is my absolute favorite here! Coated with a sugar syrup that's hardened creating a crunchy exterior. Inside is moist and very flavorful.\n\nThe others I had were just ok. I did question the freshness because the the pastry was a bit too soft.

They're mini sized and able to be gone with one bite so how could you not want to try some cream puffs? It's definitely not like Beard Papa's because these are much more smaller and not overly filled with the sweet cream. They also come in a larger variety of flavors depending on what time you come through.\n\nLocated in the Fillmore area, Choux is a bit hard to get to due to parking. Parking is all metered around the streets till 6pm Mon - Sat so be aware as you venture here. We came through on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and was able to get parking around the corner because of the amount of construction going on and the deceiving signs. \n\nService was alright. There was one lady working when we came in and she gave us a good amount of time to figure things out. I ended up spending around $18 for a box of 8 due to redeeming a reward for one free cream puff. \n\nOverall, it's a fun idea. It's more sophisticated and Instagram worthy, although probably not into getting all the time just because some flavors are more up top than others and a little too sweet.

So if you don't live in the neighborhood or drive, it's going to be a bit of a journey to get here (walking or public transportation). There is no seating inside and not much place to stand - it's literally an order and go kind of establishment. \n\nA Choux (\"shoo\") is like the cream puff version of a French macaron. It's dense in flavor and goes great with your morning tea or coffee. It's not like Beard Papas... well maybe the crunchy exterior is similar. \n\nI ordered a box of 4 Choux ($11) - 1 regular and 3 seasonal flavors. \n\nHazelnut (regular flavor) - tasted like hazelnut and was pretty good. \n\nCandy apple (seasonal) - did taste like the candy apple lollipop. The top part is like a crunchy hard candy which was a pleasant surprise. I was really impressed with the presentation and design. \n\nPeanut butter chocolate cream puff (seasonal) - fell a little short for me. I ate this one a few hours after I left the bakery, and when I tried it, I noticed it was a little sour. I don't know if that's how they make it or if time played a factor. I also didn't like the thickness of the peanut butter cream but that's just a personal preference. \n\nPumpkin (seasonal) - really good! I usually don't like pumpkin flavored desserts but this is the exception. \n\nI came around 3-4 PM, and most of their flavors were sold out. So I would advise to come earlier in the day. The variety wasn't as colorful as I expected (their Instagram had some blue, green, or purple toppings). So I guess those were just seasonal flavors.

Poets romanticize about it, dancers take flight with newfound motivation, musicals are born as a whole cast cries out in song with refrains of Choux Bakery on their lips, all while Yelp reviewers simply stammer on about how great it is!\n\nChoux is the polished precision of the French Puff Pastry. Only here, the puff parties are experimented with and interpreted with the refinement and dignity that a master pastry chef brings. Needless to say, I very much enjoyed the items we sampled at Choux Bakery. My love and I opted to try several of the most popular French Cream Puffs (le choux \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me) as well as a couple of seasonal offerings. These French Cream Puffs were smaller and slightly denser than the cream puffs I'm used to having. I love the other variety that I often enjoy at Japanese pastry shops, and wouldn't take anything away from those, but at Choux Bakery the difference provided for a unique experience for me. I loved the texture and the more flavorful approach to Choux Bakery. And the flavors...it was as if I was experience the precise and beautiful flavors of a master chocolatier's bon bons...rich and full of distinct taste that lingered with fondness after the last relished bite.   \n\nThe shop is small and located in a neighborhood, away from the beaten path, but the trek was well worth it for me.

The two small wooden chairs and a large easel propping up drawing paper with chalk makes this bakery fun and whimsical.\n\nA few friends and I stopped by Choux Bakery shortly before opening. The pastry chef, Sara, was very sweet and friendly as we chatted a bit while she was setting up the counter display of miniature choux cream puffs. Turns out, she's a foodstagrammer herself so taking photos of the adorably-decorated choux cream puffs was not frowned upon.\n\nEach choux cream puff is small, about the size of a golf ball, and expensive for $2.50 a piece. Several flavors are regulars (eg: vanilla, chocolate, pistachio), but there are two additional flavors that change monthly (eg: cookies & cream, coconut & yuzu). The pastry puffs are soft, chewy and airy, and bursting with flavorful fillings, each very distinct in flavor.\n\nAside from choux puffs, Choux Bakery also sells meringues, mason jar filled salted caramel sauce, and coffee. Chounuts are available at noon and sell out around 3pm. I'm a sucker for cute desserts, so I'll pay Choux Bakery another visit if I'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Choux and cream puffs are similar, but choux are more lighter and airy than your regular cream puffs. \n\nFor 2.50 a piece, these cute little choux are a small bite YET not over indulgent or too much like other desserts! What sets this apart from other French or choux bakeries is the unique flavor palettes. The pistachio, lemon, and strawberry are super flavorful - and the cream isn't too heavy. Personally, the other flavors are good, but nothing life changing. The cute decorations and fondant on top also give their desserts quite a charm! \n\nI would definitely suggest buying a choux box for a group of friends or as a present, but would not suggest eating a whole box to yourself like what I did. These things can get addicting when you keep telling yourself just one more!", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

And in case you haven't seen their Instagram yet (https://instagram.com/chouxsf/), it's like something out of a magazine. So very Pintrest-worthy. But I digress. The point is, this is the type of place you go to get a sweet treat for your girlfriend//girl-you-wish-would-be-your-girlfriend/mom/grandma/friend in the hospital/birthday/etc. These pretty little treats are unique gifts + definite crowd pleasers. \n\nI first had the honor of tasting some of these bitty beauties when my office ordered a whole bunch of them for a colleague's birthday http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/choux-bakery-san-francisco-2?select=pXldM8SE3fUTtNFQYTDyug. One bite + it was gone... but I was hooked. And had to have another one. I made my first visit to the shop not even a week later to see the full selection of cream puffs for myself + ended up ordering a box of 6 to take home to share with my family http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/choux-bakery-san-francisco-2?select=R_9_LV72CLdW2dkAzWgVBA. I swear I initially just planned on just getting 2-3, but I couldn't help it. There were just too many flavors that looked good. This trip resulted in getting a S'mores (seasonal!), Lemon Curd, Irish Coffee (seasonal!), Coffee Custard, Valhrona (seasonal!) Chocolate, + Salted Caramel. All were quite delectable, but the Salted Caramel + Irish Coffee were definitely the winners. \n\nOn a second visit, the first one to catch my eye was the Rum Custard. Who wouldn't be intrigued by rum in a cream puff?!? The next obvious choice for me was getting the Salted Caramel again, + I ended up rounding out the box with a Mocha (seasonal!), Cookies n Cream + Hazelnut. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=o7Y8dMLJ4gAyhAhRwIXkkA&userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ The Rum Custard unfortunately didn't make it into the photo because it was devoured before I remembered to snap a pic. Oops. But trust me, it's worth a try for being unique. As mentioned, they feature seasonal flavors based on holidays + often make the decor on top even prettier for these flavors, which again makes this even more of a gift-worthy stop. \n\nPriced at $2.50 a piece, these babies aren't cheap, but neither is the presentation of the product. I'd rather spend $15 purchasing a prettily packaged box of pretty puffs from a local business than a generic box of Godiva any day. And if you're looking for a cute date idea, take your significant other here + then trek a few blocks over to Alamo Square Park with a blanket in tow. \n\nYou're welcome.", "author": "Janelle Q."}

Received a warm welcome from Laura (the owner) when I entered store. It is my first time here and she asked how I heard about the bakery and a few friendly conversation questions. She is so nice and friendly. I was somewhat in a hurry so I didn't start any long conversation with her.\n\nI decided to get one dozen Cream puffs, a few Chonut and Mini Meringues to share with family. Laura was so kind and explained to me the cream puff flavor of the one without a sign. She also told me they were making more DAVID (S'mores) and coming out shortly.  \n\nThese cream puffs are amazing. Yes, it's bite size and a little expensive but I think it's worth the price (keep in mind, macarons are just similar in price). They have very cute name and design for each cream puff flavor. The creativity and of course the taste wins it all.  I bought LEA (Matcha), DAVID (S'mores), SUNNY (Lemon Curd), PERRY (Hazelnut), PAUL (Vanilla), SOPHIE (Chocolate), EMILIE (Rum/Caramel), RACHEL (Pistachio) and Ben (Salted Caramel).\n\nChonut is also great! I had the strawberry chonut. Again, very cute design and amazing strawberry filling. I love this better than cronut because these are baked to perfection. Cronuts from other bakeries are good but kind of oily.\n\nMini Meringues\nRose is my favorite. Perfection of sweetness and rose flavor.\nStrawberry Basil also very delicious. I was surprised with the basil flavor mixed with strawberry. Very unique!\n\nChoquette is like a no filling puff with sprinkled sugar. It's quite good. These are so much better than donut holes. \n\nOnly street parking in this area. I was lucky to find parking nearby. \n\nWould come again to try more cream puff flavors and other treats. Grab the seasonal flavors before it's gone!  I would suggest visiting their website or call them if you want to know their cream puff flavors and availability.\n\n**They offer stamp card.

Strangely enough, these bite-size morsels reminded me of Honey Berry's Roti buns. Now, Roti bun lovers, don't get me wrong because I do love Roti buns, but if I wanted a Roti Bun I would have gone to Honey Boo-boo.\nI'm not sure if this is the true sense of a french cream puff, maybe, I'm used to the westernized version of a cream puff, however the size reminded me of a macaroon. Confused? me too.  But this one did not make me \"oooh la la\" the way Pacific Puff does. I thought the variety of creams and \"topping\" were very cute.  They were good  but sadly not good enough to go back for $2.50 a pop.  I even entertained the thought of these cuties being overly done due to the brownness and extra crispness of the choux but the entire batch looked that way so maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.

Each cream puff was about $2.50, expensive little suckers. The yelp photos made them look a lot bigger. They are actually small and bite sized, like others said, about the size of a macaroon. \n\nFirst, the cream puffs look beautiful. They kind of look like cupcakes from an aerial view and that's what I thought they were when I saw photos of them initially. They taste pretty good, nothing mind blowing. The texture of the outer parts was a bit crunchy. The filling wasn't too sweet and each cream puff had a different topping which gave the some of the cream puffs a nice crunch. We ordered the chocolate custard, green tea, rum custard, pistachio, salted caramel, and coffee. I think my favorite was green tea. I just love green tea everything though, so theres a bias. \n\nThe Chonut tasted like a Eclair, but with a crunch. It was pretty good. \n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't get my creampuff fix here for myself because I think it's a bit too expensive for the size, but if you are buying for somebody else or for a special occasion then I think it's worth it because they are pretty cream puffs.", "author": "Allen C."}

A warning should be at the front door, because once you enter this will be a place you will never want to leave. \n\nAll of the gourmet French cream puffs are named after a person in the baker's life and they are extremely unique. The level of perfection and quality that these puffs hold is impeccable, and Choux has truly created the new trend. The next \"macaron\" perhaps, but completely different.\n\nThis is not your average cream puff, and everything about Choux screams that. You become a bit wary after seeing the price sign, but after looking at the delicate handiwork and seeing the amount of labor that goes into each and every single cream puff [they make them in shop] makes you realize that you would be willing to pay double for each one. (or at least I would!) The six box deal is great, where it is buy five get one free [$2.80 each] and you get to sample some of their quirky flavors. The selection is pretty vast, enough to get two boxes with a single flavor of each I would say so from what I remember, so I'm mad at myself that I didn't get more.\n\nThe flavors are so exquisite and delicate, that for a moment you are swept away in a cream puff dream land where everything is beautiful, delicious, and happy. This is how this place makes me feel. My boyfriend was just as excited as me, while we sat there trying each flavor one by one, trying to get the bigger bite, savoring every single second of the heavenly goodness. The Meyer Lemon and the Mint were the standouts flavor wise, but the PassionFruit with the candy coating and silver star sprinkles was my favorite all around because I have never seen or tried anything like it. \n\nThis place is here to stay, they aren't going anywhere and I expect a few more locations to pop up soon. I am thoroughly impressed and really excited I have a new gourmet munchie spot that's in heavy competition with the macaron in my mind. But, I've got plenty of room in my heart and mind for both.

Choux pastry is not flaky. It's light and crispy and the choux at Choux is pretty delicious. Best way to think of these are as little eclairs.

A box of these would make a beautiful and impressive gift.\nThe owner seems super nice (I randomly shared a Lyft Line with her) and I appreciate that she's branching out with other choux-y things like the Chonut. I hope this means we'll see stuff like St. Honor\u00e9 cakes in the future..?\nThe only negative for me (nitpicking) -- the names of each flavor.

The first bite was such a dreamy indulgence experience.  I was so tempted to turn the car around to get more. I was proud to have such self control, but not for too long.\n\nI went back the next day for 6 more and 16 coquettes!! Between me and my 8 yr old son, we finished them in a few minutes.\n\nI told everyone at work and they were all so interested. How could they not? Not only they are luxuriously delicious, but they just look like gems. So we ordered them for one of our meeting.

I thought that the showcased choux were a good reflection of the refined and tasteful style of the three girls working there. \nI investigated a little and got to meet Laura in person who told me about her story and how she left everything she was doing to dedicate herself to her passion for choux.\n\nI ended up buying a box of 6 choux (even the box itself was nice) and brought it to a diner I was invited. It was a success and everybody asked me were these little gems were coming from.\n\nDefinitely recommending the place for a nice gift for a friend (gf loved it), bringing for diner or just to grab a couple of choux and hot chocolate (got a trial cup - delicious) around tea time when hanging in Lower Haight.", "author": "Boris V."}

And this adorable little French bakery/cream puffery is selling the most unbelievable sweet treats.  \n\nThe decor of this shop is absolutely worth mentioning as you feel like you are transported to a tiny shop in Paris from the moment you walk in. It's obvious the owner paid meticulous attention to every detail, and it does not go unnoticed. From the beautiful stainless steal machinery, to the staff's uniforms, to the personal touches (one of the shop's walls is a blow up photo of the owner baking with her mother), to the cream puffs themselves, this place is beautiful masterpiece. \n\nAs for the cream puffs...... there are no words! I just can't stop! You can never have just one (like with Pringles \"once you pop, the fun don't stop\"). The flavors are so unique and the proportions of all of the ingredients are just right.The decor of each cream puff is as stunning as the shop itself. \n\nThe owner of Choux is lovely. She is the perfect embodiment of all that the shop represents.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-02", "description": "I was really anxious to see this open, so this is a hard review to write. \n\nWhat I like about these \"authentic French\" cream puffs is that they are bite-sized, unlike the monsters you get at Beard Papa and other places. The fillings are delicious!\n\nThere are a couple things, though, I don't like.  First, the $2.75 per piece price tag.  For a bite.  Yikes!  Second, the pastry was not as flaky as I expect from a cream puff.  Maybe it's more authentic?  Third, because of the small size, there's a higher pastry to cream ratio, and it feels like you barely get a taste of the filling (which is really good) - I'd like more to savor.  Finally, also because of the size, the toppings tend to dominate the flavor profile, and they are the least important part of the puff.  For example, I had a raspberry cream filled puff, and all I tasted was the raspberry on top.  The berry was delicious, but I wish I'd removed it so that I actually tasted the puff & cream.\n\nBecause I was sharing with my hubby, I only got half of each of 6 puffs - we both wanted to try them all.  We tried a hazelnut, vanilla, 2 types of chocolate, a raspberry and a pistachio. Maybe if you pop the whole thing in your mouth at once, you get a better experience.  But remove the topping first!  \n\nI will try them again, eating all in one bite, to see if they work for me.  But otherwise, I wouldn't be back.", "author": "Allison K."}
