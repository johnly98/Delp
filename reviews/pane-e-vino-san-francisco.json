Dishes include a big plate of fresh food (the fresh pasta items are the best!) and each meal comes with warm bread. Pane E Vino's olive oil tastes so good with the bread and is definitely different from the olive oil you might find in a typical grocery store (add salt and pepper into the oil for extra flavor!)\n\nThe menu for this place is huge and includes a ton of different Italian dishes. The server was very friendly when I couldn't decide on which pasta dish to get and he said he would \"surprise me\" with his favorite. It ended up being the \"pappardelle con funghi galletti e prosciutto\" from the specials menu. It was basically wide egg noodles in a cream sauce that was so delicious. \n\nPane E Vino is a bit pricey but I would say the price is pretty spot on for this type of \"date night\" restaurant. I think this place also caters to an older crowd; at one point during my dinner I looked around the full restaurant and noticed that my table was the only one that has diners under 30 years old. Even so, the environment was homely and inviting - I didn't feel out of place despite the age gap. \n\nI plan on coming back and trying a few other pastas as well as ordering a wine from their huge wine menu!", "author": "Michelle T."}

A crowd that looking around is probably retired or close to. \nThe service was slow but friendly.

He rated them 5 out of 10. \nMy entree was the Risotto with Seafood and it was bland/plain (probably to cater to older palates) the shrimp was hard and had more bite then most of the clientele and I could not eat much more as it was simply unappetizing.

We parked at a parking structure a couple blocks away and it was not very crowded around 5:30. \n\nEverything was delicious.  From the olive oil to the last bite of dessert, the food was so good. They served bread with real extra virgin olive oil for dipping. The spinach salad was excellent and even the regular dinner salad was good.  They were not overly dressed and the pancetta added the special touch to the spinach salad. The calamari was crispy and the marinara sauce served on the side was super flavorful. The ravioli covered in browned butter and marinara sauce was amazing. The chicken with vegetables was also delicious. The penne with cream sauce was great and not too rich. The desserts were not super heavy and they tasted great. The cheesecake was creamy and not too rich. The fruit tart was light and the cream went well with the tart berries. My favorite dessert was the affogato. It was the first time I had every tried an affogato and it tasted like the best coffee ice cream I had ever had.\n\nOverall, the whole food experience was delightful.

They unfortunately did not have the special tagliarini that it's usually made with, but they let me pick which pasta I wanted which was nice. I got fettuccini. Overall, the sauce of the pasta was really good, but I saw some other pictures on yelp that had shaved parmesan slices which I did not get.

I repeat: no room for dessert. \n\nAs far as other things you need to know: call ahead for more than 2 people and ask to be in the main room. Back room = a little lame. \n\nCorkage fee is $20 and a pretty good idea because the wine list is okay but $$$$.\n\nThat said. Food is SF-reasonable ($$)\n\nAlso, one of the best things about this place is that while is nice and in a great location - it's not prissy. The people are cool, waitstaff is there when you need them and no more than that. And the vibe is very family/friendsy. \n\nGo, go go, go GO.", "author": "Andrea D."}

We were hungry for some good Italian, so I consulted Yelp! Even though they were booked, they fit us in! We really appreciated that. The floor manager is a great guy, I can't remember his name (I had quite a few mimosas that day). \n\nThe restaurant has a nice, homey vibe, and it smelled incredible! They brought out bread with oil and balsamic vinegar, yum! We got a nice bottle of cab for the table and ordered our entree. I heard no complaints from anyone at the table, just silent, happy eating people. My own entree was wonderful, when I want comfort food, I always go for angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce. A very simple dish but it had the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had.. Which says a lot! Because I order it frequently. The others ordered more complicated dishes. The price was where it should be. The only thing that brought down one star was our server, we had to look for him a lot and he wasn't as attentive as he should have been, he was also snappy with the birthday girl who had asked a simple, sweet question.

OH MY GOD. I have to say my dish was mindblowingly good - the pasta was hand made, and oh-so-delicious, and the sauce, oh god the sauce was to die for. I am not usually a fan of cream sauces, but this one was perfect, it was ridiculously delicious without making you feel sick or overwhelmed at the end. At the end of the meal, all I wanted to do was to lick my plate which was pretty much what I did... with the remnants of the bread basket. The boyfriend's pasta was also quite tasty but I don't remember anything of the evening aside from my super delicious to die for orgasmic pasta dish.\n\nWe ended off the evening with a fresh seasonal fruit tart which tasted neither fresh nor seasonal, but after that delicious pasta dish, this place can do no wrong.

The restaurant is small and had a charming feel of a casual, neighborhood spot. With a reservation, we were seated within a few minutes. We started with the baked eggplant, spinach salad with pancetta and egg, and a bottle of prosecco. The prosecco was the perfect way to start the meal, but we were mostly left unimpressed with the food. The baked eggplant arrived hot and full of molten cheese, but was under-seasoned. The spinach salad was fine, but nothing to write home about--although I thought it was odd that they served it with slivers of a hard boiled egg instead of a soft boiled egg that would have served well with bigger pieces of pancetta. \n\nAs for the entrees, my friends and I shared the angel hair pasta with fresh tomato sauce, linguine with clams and mussels, and pizza marguerita. The pizza was forgettable, and the linguine was incredibly under-seasoned. It could have used more salt, pepper, and a hit of acidity. The angel hair pasta dish was the best out of the bunch, but it tasted a bit heavy which isn't what you expect from a fresh tomato sauce. \n\nService was good--they even brought out a complimentary tiramisu (which was delicious) with a candle for my friend's birthday--and prices we're reasonable (less than $40 per person for the whole meal, including 2 bottles of wine and tip). They do take reservations via OpenTable, so that's convenient. Overall, the food was disappointing, considering that SF is such a food-centric city. We had a good time, but I would go elsewhere for good Italian cuisine.", "author": "Parada O."}

We didn't have a reservation, so the wait was around 45 minutes, which isn't too bad compared to the other waits we had for other restaurants that weekend. They put us down and gave us a time to return. They even told us we can walk around the area and come back at that time and that they would definitely have a table for us, which we did.\n\nWe got the Bruschetta Carciofini al Olio, Salsicce Italiana mini-Pizza, and Fettucine con Prosciutto e Funghi. \n\nThe Bruschetta had a ton of flavor, and each one was overflowing with the toppings. It was actually a lot for 2 people.\n\nSkip the pizza. Snobbish New Yorker here, but I was expecting somewhat authentic pizza at an Italian restaurant, but alas, disappointed again. \n\nBut the Fettucine. It was more than enough for 2 people. Actually, the table next to us seemed to barely touch their pasta as well, and had to take it to go, but as it turns out, each plate consists of a lot more than you expect. They even separated it into two plates for us.\n\nThe fettucine was definitely the highlight though. Al dente pasta, not overly oily or watery for the sauce, and just the right amount prosciutto, tomatoes and mushrooms. The sauce was actually too good, and I scraped the rest of it with the extra bread that we asked for.\n\nThe place is pretty small, being in the back room of a hotel, and I could have reached over to snag a bite of my neighbor's food if I wanted to. But it wasn't overly loud, and service was good (although the waiter hovered a little too close to my face at times).

Addicting!!! \nWe started off with the ANTIPASTO DELLA CASA which included prosciutto on 2 cracker sticks, 2 pieces of flavorful bruschetta, salami and coppa scattered throughout, succulent not-to-spicy peperoncinis, voluptuous olives, grilled charbroiled-like tasting eggplant and a pile of pickled peppers. The meat was thin and fresh, and the peppers were tasty. Wish there was more and had some cheese. (See pic) \n\nFor my entree I ordered PAPPARDELLE ALLA CONTADINA since I love wide pasta/noodle. It got to me nice and warm, noodles having the right thickness and delicate texture. The creamy tomato sauce was light and had a soft taste which made me want it more. There were a lot of mushrooms that really tasted like mushrooms. The chicken is breast but had a simple but kind of bland taste, which was ok since it provided some protein. (See pic) \n\nMy dad and grandma both requested their own creation which consisted of simply tagliarini noodles with meat sauce. They ordered it since my grandma used to make some bomb homemade pesto with tagliarini noodles. They were both thoroughly satisfied with their meals, cleaning the bowl. They said the noodles were perfect and the sauce had more meat and less tomato which they liked since they aren't fans of acidic/greasy spaghetti sauce. (See pic) \n\nMy dad also ordered an iced tea which they gave him his own small pitcher along with his glass. \n\nMy sister ordered the CALZONE which she enjoyed due to the soft crust, fresh ingredients which can be tasted in each bite. It smelled really good when it arrived to her, giving off a nice buttery aroma. There was a generous amount of marina filling up almost half the plate on the folded part of the calzone. \n\nMy sister and I ordered tiramisu for dessert which was pretty good. The mascarpone was rich and the cocoa powder gave it a hint of chocolate. It didn't seem like there was any rum, or at least a taste of rum, which disappointed the inner alchy in me.  \n\nThe service was exceptional, giving off positive vibes as well accommodating my dad's custom pasta. \n\nOverall, I give this place 4 stars.

Bread and olive oil were yummy and the drink menu is extremely affordable--I ordered a refresher prosecco & bitters cocktail for $6 and my date ordered a glass of Chianti for $6-$8 I believe. \n\nOur meal beyond the bread and wine was OK. Even though the restaurant was not full, our meal took a while (we had to order another basket of bread while waiting). \n\nMy date ordered the rabbit special, which was delicious, except that it was not de-boned so it was like working through an obstacle course to get to the meat (to be fair, neither of us has eaten rabbit before, we could just be naive about this, but it was not an enjoyable experience). \n\nI ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and while it was tasty, I was disappointed at the quantity--there were maybe 8 thin ravioli and the tomato sauce on top looked and tasted like it was from a can. Even with the second order of bread and my main meal, I was not satiated.\n\nI would recommend this place to enjoy its so-named items--bread and wine (and maybe an appetizer). \n\nI'll just add Italian dinners in North Beach tend to be the best of the best in SF, so gauge your expectations when indulging in Italian in another part of the city.", "author": "Ashley P."}

Sadly to say I wasted her one pasta outing in almost half a year on mediocre pasta. I could tell as soon as the pasta hit her lips that she was disappointed and me being a pasta lover of just jar sauce and spaghetti was also disappointed. I felt my sauce was a little too watery and it didn't stay on the pasta well. I didn't finish the pasta and didn't even bother taking it to go (that's the first for me).

Anyways we each ordered a pasta dish. When everyone's dishes arrived, I was surprised that the pasta dishes were smaller than anticipated. My chicken pasta dish was pretty good and creamy. The wide egg noodles in there were interesting but was tasty with the sauce. My dish definetely tasted good but the flavors just didn't impress me too much. Also, my family and I didn't feel completely full after our meal and I usually get pretty full when eating pasta dishes! So for the price and how much they give you, I feel like it wasn't quite worth it. But the service here is great and sitting in the patio was awesome!

Pane E Vino is a super cute restaurant, very busy with a fun atmosphere, but the food is average and the service is atrocious. Definitely bring your own wine, the wine by the glass selection is minimal and corkage is only $20. I started with a glass of Pinot Grigio, as other Yelpers say, it's was a healthy pour but it was quite possibly the worst Pinot Grigio I have ever tasted, and it's hard to mess up Pinot Grigio. \nI ordered the Fried baby artichokes to start from the specials menu, they were actually pretty good but not what I expected. Instead of fried quarters of artichoke hearts that you normally see, it was sliced and fried fresh baby artichokes. So I ended up with a lot of leafy parts and not much of the meaty artichoke heart, but again, I enjoyed it. I decided to splurge and get the Lamb entree. It was just okay. The lamb was cooked nicely and the sauce it came with was decent but the dish just wasn't that flavorful. It cost $38. \nMy husband got the gnocchi which was just weird. It was a dish of sliced gnocchi with the sauce served on the side. He said it tasted like pan fried mashed potatoes. We looked up the dish later on the Internet and apparently it's a specific type of gnocchi dish that is supposed to be that way, it would have been nice if the waiter told us, but he was too busy not caring.\nI had the tiramisu for dessert and it wasn't very good, it tasted premade and seemed to be missing an ingredient (maybe the liqueur?) \nThe worst part was the service, if we weren't out with friends enjoying thier company we would have been even more annoyed with our waiter who literally never came to our table. He even brought my husband the wrong beer. He never poured our wine that we brought to we just poured it ourselves. Other Yelpers talk about the bread and olive oil, I wouldn't know because we ran out of olive oil and he never replenished it ever though I asked.\nRedeeming qualities include that the host was very friendly, fun atmosphere, and our friends knew one of the waiters, he seemed nice, if we had only been seated in his section this review may have been a lot different!

Ended with the BEST cheesecake we have ever tasted - usually too dessert pick so we have tried lots.  I had profiteroles - they were fine but envious of the cheesecakes my family was eating.        \nThey bring crusty delicious bread with olive oil when you sit down.  Dine here maybe stay away from the pasta with red sauce.", "author": "Moab E."}

I have been a fan of this restaurant since it was called Via Vai, and I eat here either take-our or dine-in basically monthly, sometimes more often.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and while there are great items on it- some of the BEST items are their nightly specials.  Always inquire about these before making up your mind.  They can fax the list to you if needed- helpful when you do a lot of take-out like us.  One of the greatest things about take out from Pane e Vino is their very responsible packaging- no messes- they are fortified in armor and the food looks great when you arrive home and it's ready to go!  Plus they always throw in bread and butter!\n\nMy favorite regular item on the menu is the calzone- really the best I have had.  Right now, they are being made with two types of cheese, ham, and delicious heirloom tomatoes.  Marinara sauce comes on the side.  Love it!  Their soups are delicious, great bruschetta appetizer, great pastas, and a wonderful raspberry tart for dessert!\n\nAfter just one meal, you will surely become a fan of Pane e Vino.  Reservations are helpful but not always critical- however the place is not so big and can fill up quickly.  Although the style is not precisely the same, it compares favorably to Capannina, Ristorante Milano, Mint 54, just to name a few. I'm sure you will enjoy this place just as much as I do!", "author": "Andy S."}

So - my expectations for Italian food might be unreasonably high, but take that as you wish. \nOverall - this place was good. Not great, but definitely good! I picked it mainly because it was more reasonably priced than other similar spots in the area. Authentic Italian style menu, listing appetizers, primi piatti (pasta dishes) and secondi piatti (main dishes). \nMy friend and I both ordered pasta dishes which were both very good, but the actual pasta (I had angel hair) did not taste like it was made fresh. It tasted like box pasta.

We found the service staff to be Ugly as they were extremely fast and abrupt, dropping dishes on the table or asking questions so fast and departing before we had any chance to react.

Considering its two blocks away from our apartment, we go approximately twice per month, and have become regulars.\n\nWhat I find humorous about some bad reviews that people have left placed on yelp is of the service.  Let me fill these people in on a little secret...when a restaurant is busy they don't usually have time to coddle you like a 4 year old.  The service is fine.  They may not be the most attentive, but for the most part they are knowledgeable on the food and wine.  The staff is mostly form northern Italy, and if you've ever been to Italy you will know the personality of Italiano's.  So I understand if the personality rubs San Franciscans the wrong way.  However, as an aside, once you become a regular, they treat you like gold. Also, if you attempt to speak Italian when ordering, they appreciate that as well.\n\nAs for the food: I've had mostly everything there. My rule of thumb is \"order whatever pasta is handmade:\n\n1.  My wife usually orders the Truffle Pasta, and loves it.  Its the fan favorite.  The Pasta is handmade.  Also a vegetarian option.\n2.  Any pizza is great. Thin crust, fresh sauce.  I recommend the Mushroom and Prosciutto \n3.  The Gnocchi is handmade and incredible with any sauce\n4.  The wild boar pasta with pappardelle is my personal favorite\n5.  The Veal Steak is very good.  Has a lot of rosemary and fresh veggies\n6.  Calamari appi is ok but I don't think I'd order it again.\n7.  Bolognese is good.\n8.  Cornish Game Hen is good too.\n9.  House Chianti.  We usually get the house Chianti.  The first few times we went they had 2007 San Vincenti Chianti Classico which is to die for.  They then ran out and now have a 2009.  DO NOT GET THE 2009.\n10.  If you prefer Chianti and they dont have the 2007 get Collefrisio Zero.  Its not as good as the 2007 but is somewhere between the 2009 and 2007.\n\nHope this helps.

I agree that the menu almost doubles with the daily specials which don't seem to be listed online, but there are a lot of intriguing options - we saw a couple of rabbit dishes.\n\nWe were started with a lot of excellent rustic bread - of course, an excellent sign. The olive oil was pretty light and not too flavorful, and I would have liked some balsamic vinegar to have with it, but the bread alone was superb, so that was fine. The wine list is quite extensive, but our waiter helped guide us once we had narrowed it down a bit.\n\nWe shared an order of bruschetta and an antipasto plate among 4 people, which was more than enough for everyone. The only bruschetta we saw offered was pretty plain (the classic tomato, basil, olive oil), but it was spot-on. The bread was perfectly grilled/toasted and the tomatoes were flavorful and delicious. The antipasto plate was a bit unusual to me - no cheese, various meats, and lots of vegetables and beans. I loved the peppers and both white and kidney beans, but found some of the pickled items a bit too strong. \n\nI had the pollo marinato allo griglia (chicken breast with tomato, basil, and garlic) because I felt like protein rather than carby pasta. I have to admit that I was expecting a rather dull dish, but it was *delicious*! The grilling was perfect so that the chicken breast was very flavorful and not at all dried out. I loved this meat, and there were also a lot of nice vegetables and a couple of small pieces of potato on the side. The only thing I would have changed would have been to have more tomato on it.\n\nThe pasta I tried was cooked perfectly. The bolognase was a serious meat sauce - I would have also preferred this with a lot more tomato! But it tasted good. I'd love to come back and try some other pasta dishes and the pizza.\n\nI was also impressed with the dessert. The sorbet was truly outstanding - normally I feel like sorbets are substandard and thrown on a menu without care. We had three flavors (mango, raspberry, and lemon), and all were delicious - especially the lemon! There were a couple of wrapped cookies with it as well - very nice. The cheesecake was surprisingly tasty and the berries that came with it were wonderful! I also enjoyed my cappuccino. \n\nThis is a fairly cozy spot, and I was definitely glad we had reservations on a Saturday night (there doesn't seem to be much space to wait for a table!). It was bustling, bordering on loud, but not overly so, luckily. The service was generally good, although when we arrived, we were \"jokingly\" interrogated for being two minutes late for our reservation. That's fine if we were long-standing customers, etc, but as a first impression for a restaurant, it was odd. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was generally very helpful and accepted a substitution with absolutely no fuss, which was great. But a couple of times we had a bit of trouble getting his attention, and he brought out one incorrect dish (but promptly corrected it). So, a little hit or miss, but overall the service was pretty good.\n\nIt seems easy to go to really high-end, expensive, fancy Italian restaurants in the city, but actually harder to find a more casual, but still nice, classic Italian restaurant. I think Pane e Vino fits the bill and I'd be happy to go back.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Nothing special, but something nice to start off with.\n\nThe menu here is pretty extensive so there's something for everyone.  After debating between ordering off the regular menu vs. the specials menu, I eventually decided to go with the osso buco dish off the special menu.  The osso buco came served with a saffron risotto, and (with the boy) I ate almost the entire plate.  The meat was very tender and had good flavor, and the risotto was also prepared expertly.  It really was a large portion of food, but it was so good we ate til we were past full.\n\nThe boy ordered another special dish: penne with smoked salmon and caviar in a vodka cream sauce.  The dish was really good but the smokiness of the salmon was a bit strong.  I only had a few bites of it (mostly because the boy enjoyed it so much it was going pretty quickly) but I thought that was enough.  I probably wouldn't have been able to eat the whole dish.\n\nOne friend ordered a spaghetti with tuna roe and clams, on which we really weren't sure if there was actual tuna roe on it, but our friend nearly finished his plate too.  Our last friend ordered the guazzeto di pesce (clams, mussels, shrimp, and calamari in a tomato broth) off the appetizer menu, but it was plenty big for an entree for one.  She also said it was really tasty.\n\nThe service here seemed a little distracted, though I suppose I would also lose interest in a table that hadn't really decided on food or drinks after \"browsing\" the menu for several minutes.  \n\nAll-in-all, I really enjoyed pane e vino, and because of the wide selection of dishes  I can see myself coming back for more.", "author": "Naoko M."}

Both were amazing. The ravioli a were obviously homemade and cooked perfectly. We had to share a dessert because we were so full.  We chose the profiteroles and they were amazing.  Also in a nice part of town with plenty of boutique type shops up and down Union Street. You can tell it is really good because almost all the customers are regulars and locals.

We got there just before the rush, it gets busy on a Wednesday night! We were served two lots of bread while waiting - best bread I've had in SF. The house red wine was delicious, no Corona but they do have Heineken. The food came out fast (because we beat the rush I assume), the pizza had a delicious sauce, it looked boring but tasted great. The salmon was simple, cooked well through with veges being brocolli and carrots lightly tossed in olive oil. Service was fantastic, they all appeared to be Itallians (with their accents) and one waiter loved to chat to us, so stopped at our table a couple times in passing - probably because of OUR accents :p", "author": "Sarna B."}

I should first say that the atmosphere was lovely - perfect for neighborhood Italian - tables spaced far enough apart, good lighting, nice decor.  The wait staff was also very nice and attentive.  The bread on the table and olive oil were fresh and yummy.\n\nUnfortunately, our dishes were only average.  They are known for their pastas - so I ordered the spinach ravioli with brown butter and sage (and tomato sauce?)  The two sauces did not work together - it was like I had 2 different dishes on one plate.  I ended up scraping the tomato sauce to the side.  And the pasta was too al dente for my taste. My husband had the wild boar ragout over wide noodles.   Again, it was ok - not great.\n\nWish I could give it 3 1/2 stars - that's probably a more accurate rating for the 4 star atmosphere with the 3 star food. The pricing was good for the entrees - so we'll probably try it again - hopefully we'll  have better luck next time.", "author": "Nanny M."}

The heat wave had just dissipated, so we were walking down Union, after a stroll in the park with our pup, enjoying the \"normal\" Spring SF temperatures. We walked by Pan e Vino and thought it would be so nice if we could eat our favorite truffle pasta outside with our dog. My hubby figured there was no harm in asking so he went in and talked to the host. Within 30 seconds, he scooped up a table, carried it over his head, and proceeded to set it up outside for us. Now that's service!!!!! We were so appreciative and the great service didn't stop there. I wish I knew our server's name, but he was so friendly and attentive. He always made sure we had enough water in our glasses and oil and bread on the table.  A bus boy even brought or dog some water in a to-go container.

It's a beautiful back room, with clear ceilings so the sunlight can shine in. Flower pots hung from the terrace providing a wonderful outdoor feeling. As the only group in the back, we felt like VIPs! SCORE!!!!! \n\n...not!\n\nWe were neglected. Given menus, the waiter leaves. 15 minutes, 20 minutes. No one come backs. Finally a busboy walks by and we waved him down. He said he'll get the waiter. Another 5 minutes, 10 minutes. Where the hell is the waiter?! The same busboy walks by again. Ummm...we would like to order. He said he'll get the waiter...again.\n\nMoving forward...\n\nThe food was good, some more enjoyable than others. Their usual pastas are flavored well. I had order off the special menu, risotto with quail and mushroom. The arborio rice was slightly undercooked (not enough liquid). I was quite surprised that they serve the dish with 2 quails. The quails were quite delicious but difficult to eat. The risotto itself was plain and bland. Had to mix the juice from the quail to actually enjoy it.\n\nSo here comes the worse part of the dinner, which made me vow to never come here again...\n\nThe total bill came to less than $300, which was pretty good for 15 ppl. 11 people paid in cash with 4 people charging their own portion on their credit card. Our waiter takes our cash and cards. 10 minutes later, it was the manager that returns with the bill and receipts. He goes...\"Here are your cards. But there's a problem with the cash.\" He takes a stack of cash and counts it in front of us. \"You guys only paid $97.\"\n\nOMG. We were all like WTF?! I don't know about other people, but when my friends and I pay as a group, we usually make sure that everyone paid their portion and the bill adds up. \n\nWe were so upset, because here we are, being accused of shortchanging the bill. We had counted $227 in cash and added up the separate credit card charges before handing the waiter our bill. Even if we were off in cash, I don't think we would be short more than $100. We told him we paid more than $200 in cash. And the manager insisted that this is what our waiter had given him, which led us to suspect that the waiter had taken our money.\n\nTime passed and the manager just stood there expecting us to do something. Of course we weren't gonna put in more money, since we KNOW we paid the right amount. Finally, with us not budging, the manager goes out and asks the waiter. THEN...he comes back in and apologize saying that there was a confusion with the bills.\n\nLike the song...it was \"too late to apologize\". One sorry was not enough. We were disgusted, with the manager, with the accusations, with the whole situation. \n\nThe food is definitely not good enough to make me come back. Never again.", "author": "Marti L."}

We had to ask for bread and water refills way too often, it was annoying. The only person that was nice was infact the water boy who of course spoke no english. The server was impatient for the entire meal as well. He wanted us to order pretty much right as he greeted us and didn't care to accomodate my younger sister (she's 10 years old.) I don't care how FINE of dining you think you are, you accomodate your guests regardless. He didn't recommend any dishes suitable for a child her age nor did he take the time to recommend anything to me and my friend. The best part of the meal was of course, the food. We had a margherita pizza, eggplant lasagna, and plain pasta with butter. It was filling and delicious. The server didn't check up on us at all throughout the whole meal which was again, annoying.

Surprisingly not that many places in SF actually do.   \n\nPane has a huge variety of pasta, fish, meat and appetizers, everything was very authentic, the bread wasn't great and since it's part of the title and a staple in Italy that is something they should work on.    Some dishes were simple and almost homely and some very elaborate with flavors expertly intertwined together.  Just depends on what you want..  The portions are great too, not too big and of course you have to have wine.  \n\nThe courtyard is great too, gives you a completely different feel for dinner.

It's a covered patio with the ambiance of a grape arbor, and a view of the kitchen complete with cooks rushing around and gleaming copper pots hanging in the window.  If only the food had been as good. I usually order veal the first time at any Italian restaurant - both because I like it and because it's a good gauge of the quality of their cooking. I got the scaloppini in a mushroom sauce and while the sauce was excellent, the veal itself was like cardboard. The bread, with a good dipping oil, was yummy - crusty outside, soft inside. Well of course; it was from Acme. We got the caprese salad, attractively plated, tomato fresh and in season - but the mozzarella fresca was on the firm side. At Il Cortile in NY we were served soft, falling-apart bufala mozzarella, and have rated capreses ever since on that standard. I can't remember the hub's entree at Pane e Vino, and neither can he, but it was equally o-k but not great. On the way out, we saw that the main dining room was dimly lit, loud, and crowded.

Last night at Pane e Vino, my friend ordered a halibut dish and asked whether the chef could substitute mushrooms for the tomatos in the sauce.  \n\nThe waiter  responded by saying that the sauce was already mixed.  Well that was sort of a bad sign...pre-made sauce?  Tell me, what size jar was it in?  But he said the chef would add mushrooms to the fish.\n\nThe halibut came out and, no joke, the mushrooms came in a dish on the side.  Why?  Because the chef felt they didn't go with the dish, and they actually took the time to put them in a separate plate.  Now, that is Nick Cannon HI-larious.  What part of \"service\" industry doesn't this place understand?\n\nTo his credit, the waiter was really polite about the whole thing -- it was clearly a chef issue.  But it was a little strange.  My pasta wasn't bad, although the plate of mixed vegetables on the side tasted like it had been microwaved.\n\nSo plus stars (1) it's inexpensive and (2) the prosciutto was excellent and the serving generous, and (3) nice decor.  But minus stars for an arrogant chef and, more importantly, a casual Italian restaurant should have more than four choices of red wine by the glass, especially when two of the four are chianti.", "author": "Geoff K."}

They kept us waiting for almost 1/2 hour before taking our orders.  I asked to taste one of their wines and was told \"We don't do that\".  When I asked the host to recommend a wine he said \"No, you choose.  If I choose I know how that will go\".  The food was mediocre at best.  Tomato sauce tasted like it came from a jar.  Seafood and fish were not the freshest.   Pasta was very ordinary.\n\nSad to say -- we will not be returning.", "author": "Debbie W."}

This is the sort of Italian eatery every neighborhood should have, and indeed, outside of us, there seemed to be a preponderance of regulars, a nice sign on a Monday evening.\n\n----\n\nTried this Marina Italian eatery for the first time last night. It's very cozy inside, and you get the sense that the staff is all family. There are a lot of options to try, but I went with the homemade lasagna, which was excellent, and hopefully an indication of the rest of the menu (and why all the tables were full on a Sunday evening).

I always thought, well, maybe next time... \n\nA friend was up from So Cal a couple of months ago, and he was going to pick the restaurant. We walked all the way down the south side of Union from Gough to Fillmore, continued up Fillmore to Chestnut, did both sides, checking menus, etc, and all the way back on the north side of Union. The last place before we got back to \"go\" was Pane E Vino. He must've read 20 menus...he says \"This is it!\". \n\nSo, yeah, I got to try Pane E Vino finally. We ended up getting bruschetta, which is always good isn't it?

Maybe it's because I was wearing a hat and both E-Class and I rocked hoodies. Whatever the reason, Pane E Vino didn't seem very happy to have us.\n\nThe guy who seated us looked disappointed, and our waiter seemed annoyed when E was not ready to order two minutes after we arrived. He eventually seemed to warm up to us, but maybe that's because time heals all wounds - he ignored us from after our food was served until we were finished. I was THIRSTY.\n\nSo yeah, the service kinda blew. The food, on the other hand, was pretty darn good. I had my first cheeseless pizza, which was tasty but could have used, um, cheese. My bad. E had something with mushrooms and it was delicious.

The owners closed their other location further down on Union St and combined the two. This restaurant is definitely a place for solid Italian cuisine combined with an authentic serving staff. \n\nNow I've actually played the \"who has the best pizza in town\" game and upon visiting the classic favorites incl. Delfina and A16, I always come back to Pane e Vino for their authentic, Italian thin crust pizza. It, truly is the best you can find in SF. They've got about 15 difft pizzas to select from and it's hard to go wrong. I've had the margherita, sicilliana, and capricciosa and they're all winners. If you're looking for something really special - get the quattro formaggi and add prosciutto. The pizzas are a fairly good size so remember to share!\n\nMore favorites of mine include the housemade lasagna, ravioli, spinach salad, and the roasted chicken. If you don't know Italian reds too well, consider bringing your own ($20 corkage).\n\nWhether you're looking for a romantic date night, authentic Italian cuisine, casual dinner spot, or just some good take out - keep Pane e Vino in mind.", "author": "Josephine H."}

A16 gets rave reviews for their pizza, but personally I wasn't thrilled.  I once offered up my A16 pizza to a homeless man who turned it down.  What to think on this?  The pizza at Pane et Vino is different than any pizza I have had.  It has a generous amount of cheese, but not too much.  I ordered a pizza that had prociutto on it, and vegetables as well, and my vegetarian dining companion was able to eat the other half because they miraculously separated!

Our waiter was friendly and knew the menu well.  He was able to recommend wine and the best dishes, and was attentive to us even while it was very busy.  There's nothing worse than asking a server for recommendations and having them not know about the menu or not care about the people dining.  Oh, and our server was Italian, *bonus.  And... even though we were dressed very casual we weren't paid less attention to because of it.  \n\nStar #3 - The food and wine was really really good - we picked a Pinot Nero from Italy that was better than I was expecting for being one of the cheapest bottles on the menu - $38.  I'll be looking for it in stores.  The food was plentiful, flavorful, warm and delicious.  I had the basic salad which was better than expected - and the farfalle salmone (bow-tie)with sun-dried tomatoes and peas in a tomato cream sauce - b o m b.  It was rich and delicious and I was full before getting halfway through it.  I'm looking forward to eating it again tonight as left-overs.  He had prosciutto wrapped asparagus and a mushroom/chicken/cream sauce pasta that was also very good.  The asparagus was to die for.  \n\nStar #4 - The crowd was mellow, and of all ages.  I like going to restaurants where there are older couples, families, young couples on dates, and groups of friends.  There was a lot of variety, so I know it's a great place for any occasion.  The tables aren't too close to each other either - we were able to have a private conversation without thinking other people were listening or having to whisper.  It wasn't too loud, and the music was delightful - they played Pavarotti! I hate having to talk louder than normal to have a convo or be watchful of the people next to you hearing your every word.  The ambiance was perfect.\n\nWhy no 5th Star?  - The bus boys were a little clueless - I saw them delivering tea/coffee to the wrong tables, my doggie bag was given to someone else (before I hollered that it was mine) and one kid dropped a knife on our table.  Some might have been upset with it but we didn't mind - we're pretty easy going.  \n\nOverall, a great experience for a last minute decision on Valentine's Day.

A same size family came in afterwards and they were allowed to sit in a booth. They loaded our small table with water glasses, sugar and carafes etc. so it was very difficult to place down any food dishes. I kept having to ask the busboy to clear the dishes.\n\nMy husband and I ate linguine with clams and mussels. The first mussel I ate was under cooked, the second one I ate had a shell in it.

Well, I have been there 30 times...do you think I like it? All kidding aside, there are three great reasons to come here.\n\n1. Staff - They are always cordial to anyone, and more importantly, everyone. You are greeted at the small entry way (with just enough standing room for 6 people) by one of the 3 fantastic hosts there. They make sure you are comfortable and don't have to wait long. On 3 separate occassions, they have allowed us to sit at the bar with a complimentary appetizer to help with the apparently long wait ahead. Once seated, service is friendly, and low pressure while still being attentive. The wait staff (if busy) clearly works together to pick up slack if need be. This makes it better for us, the customer.\n\n2. The Restaurant - It is never too loud, but never too quiet. Large groups can feel as much at home as a few good friends or a couple. The lighting in the restaurant is romantic, but not dim. The aroma of the wood burning ovens is nice, and the seating is fairly comfortable. Even out in the back patio.\n\n3. THE PIZZA - I have heard so many of these New Yorkers talking about our pizza this, our pizza that...blah blah. I'll give it to them, their East Coast pizza is better than our East Coast pizza. BUT THIS IS NOT EAST COAST PIZZA. This is BETTER pizza inspired from countryside villas in ITALY. The crust is crisp and very thin. the sauce is not smothered on like  finger paint, but put on lightly, the ingredients are not Pepperoni and cheese, but Prosciutto, wonderful mushrooms, basil goat cheese, etc. The temperature is always perfect, and it always has that smokey flavor that it should have.\n\nOverall, the appetizers are good, the entree's are good, but the pizza and service are great! Oh and by the way, their wine list is pretty extensive. Prices are definately fair.", "author": "Michael M."}

So I'll tell you about this gem, but only if you promise to keep it just between us, OK? Now consolidated with Via Vai, Pane e Vino serves regional Italian-style cuisine, featuring simply grilled fresh fish and meats, thin-crusted pizzas, and exceptional pasta dishes, all of it extremely flavorful. Despite the name, man cannot live by bread and wine alone, so start out with the spinach salad, the crisp leaves tossed with warm pancetta and eggs in a balsamic vinger-olive oil dressing. Move on to farfalle (bowtie pasta) with smoked salmon, firm peas, and sun-dried tomatoes in a rich cream sauce. Then dig into a rosemary-scented rib-eye steak with a side of Tuscan beans. End it all with any one of the following - a caramelized apple served with sour cream and almond sauce, profiteroles filled with white chocolate gelato and topped with hot chocolate sauce, or a heavenly tiramisu. Considering the upscale Cow Hollow location and the quality of the food, prices are shockingly low - pastas are $12 and $13, entrees run between $15 and $25, pizzas from $10 to $13, and most desserts are $6.

(My date would probably tell you that our dining experience was great because of her.)  Everything was excellent from the eggplant appetizer to the pasta to the wine to the dessert.  I think the only reason I got a third date out of the lovely lass sitting across from me was because of our meal.  (God knows it wasn't because of my scintillating witticism and bon mots.)  Our experience was so great that we eventually returned for a group dinner about a year ago.  Talk about a total 180.  Bad service, sub par food, and a total ripoff job on our wine selection.  We chose one bottle, and they did a bait and switch with another.  This resulted in a $150 bottle of grape juice landing on the table.  Bad form.  This experience so soured the lovely lass mentioned above that we did not return until last week.\n\nHaving just returned from my annual Christmas sojourn in Jersey, I was missing Momma's cooking, so I wanted some Italian grub.  Somehow, someway, we ended up in Pane E Vino.  This would be the rubber match.  I was rooting for Pane E Vino to redeem itself.  The lovely lass had it in for the place.  Things started off badly for Pane E Vino when we got there.  The hostess was completely incompetent.  We did not have a reservation, so she was totally befuddled.  She said that she had several groups coming in later with reservations.  Several means three.  I saw four open tables.  I then looked into the reservation book and saw two reservations coming up in the next half hour.  You could see the smoke coming from the hostess's ears over the complexity of this higher math.  She told us to go sit at the bar and have a drink.  We did.  Problem.  It's not a real bar.  And no one asked us if we wanted anything.  \n\nJust as I was about to lose it, our waiter from our very first visit walked by.  If you go, ask for him.  He's the dude with the shaved head and the shirt two sizes too small.  (I have heard that chicks dig this look.)  He immediately began apologizing for the delay, pointed out a table being prepped for us, and told us that it would be ready in a minute or two.  Message  to the owners: fire the incompetent arithmetically challenged wench who was working on Sunday December 30th and give shaved head guy a raise.\n\nFrom there things were fine.  Our waiter was about 12 years old, but he knew the menu and answered all of our questions.  We ordered a roasted eggplant antipasto that was a special.  It was delicious.  I then had the ravioli special.  It was superb.  It came in a sage butter sauce that was interspersed with a chunky marinara.  This may not sound very good, but believe it was.  Two great tastes that tasted great together.  The lovely lass had the fettuccine with porcini mushrooms.  Also excellent.  The portions were perfect.  We were satiated, but did not roll out the door.  The bill was a little higher than I expected, but we got jacked on 2 glasses of mediocre Sicilian wine.  (Aren't mediocre and Sicilian redundant?  Or is it criminal and Sicilian that are redundant?  I can never get those two straight.)\n\nCongratulations Pane E Vino, you won the rubber match.", "author": "Chris I."}

She then walks away for 10 minutes, still hasn't said anything to me, by now it's obvious she's avoiding the hostess area. Other people have walked in too, she looks over every now and again and just takes us all in, as we collectively are all annoyed. Finally she walks over and I have to say (to the side of her head), \"excuse me, I am here for my 7:30 reservations.\" She goes, \"what?!\"  This is the lady I talked to 3 hours previous who took the reservation (I can distinguish her voice), and obviously did not write it down. she just goes, \"well it's crazy tonite\", and walks away FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES. \n\nNow my party is annoyed as well, finally when she comes back after avoiding us all again, we just ask when we can be seated, at this point we still want to eat at the restaurant and want the simple kindness of being told when we can eat, which 25 minutes into it she has not told us or even hinted that she can tell us.

We felt rushed, the food was good but nothing overly special, and the service was just ok.  We had a lengthy wait for things we asked for (bread, oils, wine, etc.) but never got the feeling like we did the first time we were there.  It made us think that because we had been with someone important, that we were treated that way.  And, when we went ....  just us, it was different.  A little disappointing as the first impression was so amazing.  The last impression wasn't the same, and therefore, we'll probably not rush to go back!", "author": "J L."}

The portions here are not gigantic like my stomach but they aren't skimpy either.  The eggplant parmigiana antipasta dish is probably the best eggplant parmigiana ive ever eaten.  Fattys like me love parmigiana because lots of cheese and sauce really makes the belly grow.  Not only is the food here amazing, but the other diners are my heroes as well.  Sitting next to people talking about how much money they have is freaking awesome.  I wish they would give some to fill my fat ass.  The highlight of the night was a 30 year old asian lady coming in on a date with a 70 year old, balding caucasian male.  I am pretty sure she was either a mail order bride or into his good looks.

I also ordered the spinach/ricotta ravioli with marinara sauce and it was equally impressive. My friends had the duck said it was \"good\"; the lasagna was \"good\" and the flat noodle with meat sauce was \"ok\". I guess i was the best orderer in the group!

We were greeted and seated by a friendly hostess and then greeted by an even friendlier waiter with a very obvious Italian accent. To start we ordered the ANTIPASTO DELLA CASA which was a assortment of cured meats and vegetables. It was good it had a variety of different flavors and spices. For our first course we had the pumpkin gnocchi and it was incredible. My boyfriend ordered the veal shank osso bucco served on risotto. The veal literally melted in your mouth and the risotto was perfectly cooked. I had the chicken breast topped with tomatoes and garlic. The flavor was great but the chicken was a little dry. I would love to go back and try something else.", "author": "Melanie V."}

We shared appetizers including the veggie pizza and mixed green salad. The pizza was good with fresh eggplant and bell peppers. The salad was drenched in oil. For the price of the salad ($8 or $9), I expected either fancier greens or larger quantity. For my main course, I had the fusilli con melazane with smoked mozzarella which was on the bland side. It would've been better with less pasta, more eggplant and cheese, more garlic, and a bit more salt. For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate cake which I found dry.

It's not swanky, but the ambiance is perfectly nice. Great place to go when you feel like consuming 10 million calories of yum.  \n\nService: The service is hand-down fantastic. Both times we made reservations with almost no notice and were able to get tables (although the restaurant seemed quite full). When we showed up fifteen minutes early, (no bar at which to wait) we were graciously shown to our seats and brought menus. The waiter (same waiter both times) was gregarious, helpful, and ever-present, but never intrusive. He recommended a delicious Spanish dessert wine to enjoy with our Tiramisu. \n\nFood: We ordered a gorgeous Barolo, which they happened to be out of, so they brought us the same wine, but a better year, for the same price.  Wine list had a lot of great Italian choices.  The bread and flavorful olive oil with the wine ... stunning...  \nTo start, we had the Mozzarella alla Caprese and the Scallops with Grilled Polenta.  The mozzarella was good, the tomatoes and basil fresh, no complaints. The scallops were flavorful, but a bit chewy for my tastes; however, the tomato cream sauce and grilled polenta were incredible. I had to be restrained from licking the plate clean.  \nI followed up with the Taglialini with Mushrooms in a Cheese and Cream  sauce -- it's on the specials menu -- get it. So decadent, so creamy, so very, very bad for you. You WILL come back for this. My friend had the margarita pizza, which was also incredible. \nWe finished up with the Tiramisu, which we didn't need, but had to have. \n\nAll in all, a great comfortable place to have a nice dinner.

The wait staff is friendly and attentive but I won't share my favorite waiter's name cause I want to horde him to all to myself cause he treats us like family every time.\n\nThey have a wood-fired oven where they cook pizzas and other entrees.  My personal favorites are the insalata mista (a simple mix of greens and shredded leeks w/oil & vinegar), pasta puttanesca (capers, anchiove and olives will never steer you wrong), grilled salmon and when I'm feeling especially gluttonous, the bistecca alla fiorentina.  Seriously, the steak is like something you'd see on the Flintstones and comes with huge portions of sides like yummy beans.  It's really two full meals and could easily be shared or take half home for the next day.  I find that it's helpful to order the meat a bit more rare than you would like (example: I like medium but I order medium rare - this works most times).
