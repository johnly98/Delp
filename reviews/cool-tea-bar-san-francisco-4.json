Not much seating more like 2 couches, and a table. \n.\nOrdered my usual kumquat green tea with aloe, less ice and less sweet. The difference from sac is the price is 50 cents more in SF. \n.\nThe drink is still the same as sac. Of course its refreshing and thirst quenching. Love the large size. \n.\nOverall if your craving a large drink that will last then this is the place for it. Number one roasted milk tea is my To go to unless I want refreshing drink then it be kumquat green tea. One thing that threw me off is the wet slippery floor where they make drinks. Just makes the place look unsanitary and feel kinda eeekkk.... makes me think of the water they use to make the tea and etc. So yea this place is prolly my pick up and on the go type of place for me.

As the previous \"Cool Tea Bar\" (not too far from here) closed not too long ago, they officially relocated or permanently placed at a different location at the same neighborhood at Chinatown's Waverly Pl in San Francisco. What does Cool Tea Bar do? They offer the customers of all ages to slurp their finest creations of bubble teas, refreshing juices and standard iced teas combined! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most Cool Tea Bar locations has across California, yet it's much smaller compared to Sky Parkway location in Sacramento. It's much cleaner and tidy inside with few chairs and tables around.\n\nThe baristas here are doing a good job for making the customers like me a remarkable service. No cons at all.\n\nNow onto the drinks! I ordered two drinks of: Honey Green Tea with black bobas (no sugar) and Honey Lemon Aloe (30% sugar preference); both in regular sized to-go cups. As my father and I drank both drinks, they were perfectly good! The Honey Green Tea tasted perfectly because I can feel the natural flavors of green tea and honey combined without adding additional sugar! On the other hand, the Honey Lemon Aloe also tasted not bad as my father did feel the aloe crunch and the minor sweetness of the honey and lemon. Not bad for some good refreshments after hanging around at Chinatown for nearly 3 hours long!\n\nParking at Cool Tea Bar can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. You can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, this Cool Tea Bar at Waverly Pl is closely, definitely the finest bubble tea shop that I've ever visited right here at San Francisco's Chinatown. Perfect for friends and family gatherings. My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

It got the lowest sugar amount for the oolong and it was still sickeningly sweet and I couldn't taste the tea. This is the only time I've ever tossed a milk tea because it was undrinkable. My brother got the matcha, and that, too, was also undrinkable. The matcha isn't great quality and tasted very, very off. I got my parents the taro milk tea, and that, too, was met with \"thanks for thinking of us but please never get that for us again ever\".\n\nIt sounds like other folks have had better drinks, so perhaps the non-milk teas are better.\n\nEven though this place is close to my parent's home, I'd rather drive to the city to Mr. T or to Millbrae for Search Tea.", "author": "Robbin A."}

I'd explore other places just because they exist, but I had only a few issues with Cool Tea.\nTip: It's not ON Clay Street, so look down the little alleyways. It's about 2-3 shops in and has a giant \"Cool\" on the sign.\nTip: Accepts credit cards, unlike most bubble tea places. Thank goodness!\n\nWe were in the mood for some bubble tea, and the Cool Tea Bar was close by and open on Sunday, so we decided to give it a try! It was a little confusing to find because the map pointer on mobile devices doesn't show the side street, so we almost walked past it before we realized it was on the alley street and not the main street. Regardless, there was another bubble tea place right across the street if we hadn't been able to find it. \n\nOnce inside the shop, you are greeted with a dimly lit but brightly painted establishment! There was only one staff member working when we were there, but it can get crowded at times which can drive the wait time up. There also are a few tables to sit at, which most bubble tea places don't offer for patrons looking to sit down and wait or just hang out. Even better, there's free WiFi! There's a sign a little above head level on the left when you walk in, if you want to see the password. On the opposite wall is a TV with some of the menu items, and attached to the cash register is a little billboard with additional items. I was surprised at how few options there were! I'd say Cool Tea probably only has a third of the options of a place like Tea Era. The only fruity options were passionfruit green tea and mango green tea, for example. \n\nI ordered a mango green tea with boba, and unfortunately the boba ratio was quite far off. I finished all the boba with about a third of the drink left, which left me sadly drinking the rest with nothing to chew. However, the drink was really good! A great mix of mango flavor without overpowering the green tea, and the sugar level was spot on. \n\nAll in all, I think Cool Tea was okay. I think it's a safe place to go back to if I didn't want to explore, but it would definitely take a lot to keep me from trying one of the other myriad bubble tea shops in Chinatown and the surrounding area.

I ordered regular taro milk tea with boba and it was the strangest taro tea I've tried before. The girl at the counter was friendly and did warn me it would have a thicker consistency, but that wasn't the issue. The consistency wasn't any different then any other tea, but it did have some grainy (taro/rice chunks?& yes It was different then when you add regular taro as a topping) not sure what it was but it was odd/grossing me out. It's also unfortunate they did not make taro smoothies as I usually prefer that consistency. I guess it isn't made with artificial flavoring, but I wasn't really aware, glad I tried it but not for me. Anyways not sure how the other drinks are since taro is the only thing I order when I get boba.", "author": "Hoku L."}

Got the recommendation for this place from one of the festival workers when we asked for a \"good boba place.\" Got the original milk tea with boba- it was delicious and did not disappoint. I'm not a fan of overly sweet drinks, and I found that the tea here was perfect (sweet, but not too sweet). The boba was cooked to a soft and chewy perfection. Unlike other boba places, they didn't pack the drink full of ice, which meant that the drink was consistent from beginning to end and not watered down at the last drop. \n\nWord of caution- their large drink is HUGE. When we ordered, our thought process went something like \"$4.00 for a regular and only 50 cents more for the large? We might as well go with the large,\" without realizing that large meant 32 oz of milk tea with boba. Delicious as it was, by the time I got to the last 1/6 of my drink, I thought I was going to throw up.", "author": "Sharon C."}

I suppose they only offer a limited menu here due to the location and the size of the store. I settled with the Jasmine Milk Tea on their top drinks list since I did not want to guess what they have available. The Jasmine Milk Tea was nothing special, it tasted like regular milk tea with a heavy taste of creamer or milk. But on the bright side they do take credit cards which is rare in Chinatown.

My friend has been raving about this place so I thought I'd give it a try. This please was in an alley but still visible if you were walking up clay street. Anyways, I walk in and it wasn't too much of a line. I ordered a black milk tea with boba and a passion fruit with lychee jelly. I couldn't decide what I felt like so I just got both... at the very least I could save one for the next day.\n\nFirst off, can I say that I am a boba drink fanatic? Though my reviews won't show it BUT I do visit a lot of boba places and literally get a drink every other day if not everyday! So this place is not that impressive.... the black milk tea was practically all milk. There's like a tease of a flavor of tea but it is not apparent at all. Actually, that hint of flavor repulses me.. I couldn't even finish the drink! The boba was small and I wasn't sure if they are the kind of establishment that sells 2 sizes but if they did, i wanted the BIGGER BALLS! (teehee). So definitely not impressed with this drink.\n\nNot much better with my 2nd drink. Passion Tea I know if already a sweet drink but this was overly sweet and no tea mixed in at all!!! The lychee jelly is standard so no complaints there, For a Cool TEA bar... there's is definitely a lack of tea in all their drinks. I definitely won't be coming back to this place anytime soon.... sorry but not sorry!", "author": "Mark L."}

If you choose the latter option, you'll pay the exact same price, but you'll get better quality. Now, there will be an iTea opening up in the area soon, so that will be your go-to, but until that day comes, Cool Tea Bar does the trick. The drinks aren't overly sweet, and you'll get decent quality tea. They customize, and they have plenty of toppings. The roasted oolong with grass jelly is a classic, but I highly recommend their matcha smoothie with red beans as well. Anything with 50% sweetness will do just fine. It's an extra 50 cents for a larger size, so go nuts. They also have free wi-fi if you want to work for a little bit, but that's not really a Ctown thing.", "author": "Danny C."}

Usually boba spots are quick and dont take that long ESPECIALLY with multiple staff in the back.

I quickly asked them what happened to number 28 and they handed me another boba which was not my order so i let them know they gave me the wrong number. After giving me a confused look i repeated what i got and they said \" oh okay! sorry. ill make it right now\" so i patiently waited some more and the worker handed me a new drink which was jasmine milk tea with lychee and boba which was incorrect again. I mentioned i had not gotten lychee and had ordered egg pudding instead and she asked me \" can i just add egg pudding?\" uhhh no thank you lady, if i wanted lychee i wouldve ordered it.
