The sushi rotating on the boats (basically a sushi train) was really limited to only a few options, with little sides and mainly just basic rolls. It's not the most convenient to order things if you sit at the bar because they don't even have menus with actual dishes other than the sushi rotating in front of you -- I had to ask if they have sashimi and how much it was. \n\nHaving said that, the food wasn't bad, quite good.

The first time we came we were sat and had decent service and average food.  \n\nThe pros are since it's on a conveyor belt the food is readily available when you sit especially if you do not mind how long the pieces have been sitting out (we definitely watched several of the same pieces go by the entire time we were there). \n\nCons are the food is just average and the specialty ones are few and far between and are pretty pricey for one or two bites.  We also ordered an app of tempura while we were waiting for good options to come around on the boat and it was ridiculously greasy and terrible. \n\nThe worst experience of all was the second time we visited. We arrived around 910 and the restaurant closed at 10. We walked in right after three guys and we all were told to sit and wait and we'd be seated soon. After watching the same few pieces of sushi go by we were a little worried. The three guys got sat 5 mins before us and ate the pieces that had been circling.\n\nWhen we were seated a few mins later we were starving and ready to eat. Unfortunately no more sushi was placed on the bar. Not a word was said to us when we were told to wait for a table nor when we were seated that no more sushi would be made. We even ordered an app of goyza because we were starving and needed something while waiting for the sushi. The waiter still failed to mention there would be no more sushi. After waiting 10 mins we flagged someone down and questioned the empty bar and they said we have to order from the menu and that they would not be putting out anymore sushi. When we asked why this was not told to us before being sat or for the 10 minutes we sat there they had no response. \n\nWhat a waste of time. We left hungry and disappointed and will not be returning.", "author": "Danielle B."}

I know). It's pretty unassuming from the outside in a residential area off of market. The interior of the restaurant is great. It's nicely decorated and spaced out from the walls and the waiting area which I feel like a lot of other sushi bars lack. You are close to your neighbor but they did a good job of spacing everyone out even though it was dinner time on a Saturday. \n\nFirstly, these speed boats come by FAST. It's not so fast that you can't grab what you want. The speed is reassuring however so they can get you the goods ASAP. It's also nice that you can see all there is to offer before you start attacking the boats like the hungry kraken you are, as in, you don't feel forced to take that veggie roll that's inching by when you're dying of hunger. \n\nThe real star of the show is obviously the sushi. Every single dish is gorgeous. The restaurant isn't super bright so it's not a trick of the lighting but the sushi was gleaming, well presented and looked extremely appetizing. The rolls and nigiri had thick cuts of fish on them - they are really trying to feed you. One of the best rolls I had was a maki roll with crab, avocado, and salsa on top! These came with a side of taro fries. I'm a big fan of salmon and also noticed that there was no shortage of it. At a lot of the cheaper sushi bars, you'll see a lot of undesirables going around but not here! The sushi prep is done right in the middle of the revolving bar and the chef will take requests as well. \n\nI loved this place for the ambiance, great service and delicious sushi!

Definitely a couple of levels above other conveyor belt sushi in San Francisco. As a sushi place this is a four star experience.  As a boat sushi place it's five stars plus. \n\nAs another reviewer noted, don't come here looking for omakase or exotic sashimi. That being said, there's more here than meets the eye\n\nTo wit:\n\nThe live scallop sashimi is incredible. And seasonal. You have to order it from the specials board. It's served in the shell. \n\nSame high marks go for the white tuna sashimi. Yes it's heavily sauced but it's a terrific fish and sauce combination. Worth the price. \n\nTheir oysters (seasonal) are also worth snapping up as the come around. \n\nThe spicy seafood salad doesn't roll around on the belt. You have to order it. It's a popular item and truly delicious. The octopus is truly exceptional here. \n\nWhen I sit down I check to see what's rolling around. If I don't see my favorites I order them. The spicy tako is like a little octopus and cucumber composed salad in spicy sauce. I eat three no problem. My partner lived the Mayo heavy white tuna sashimi. It comes with a cherry tomato. Tuna tataki is my hands down favorite with its gingery garlicky goodness. Get two. \n\nOther standouts are the special salmon roll (no cream cheese. It with scallions), the hamachi nigiri and the asparagus tempura roll. \n\nI always find a good balance of variety in nigiri as well as rolls. \n\nI like to sit at the front where the \"sashimi\" guy does his work as opposed to the back where the \"roll\" guy works. I prefer the fresh fish to rolls.\n\nPic of spicy tako attached.", "author": "Tim P."}

Sushi is always a great option and having it served on a conveyor belt is just so cool. The problem with SF is that we don't have enough of these places. \n\nFor Warakubune specifically, I've ended up coming here twice in a couple of weeks because of the overall experience. The place doesn't seem very big so sometimes a small line forms but don't get discouraged! Everything moves so fast. On my first visit, we were sat right away; the second visit had 3 parties in front of us and we were sat within 10 minutes. The staff is efficient. With having 2-3 servers at all time, you're bound to find the help you need. Within the middle of the conveyor belt are 2 sushi chefs constantly making creations for special orders and for the belt. Anything you can think of and imagine is made and your job is to grab what you want and what looks good. In my mind, it's kind of a production line stretch of omakase, where you eat what the sushi chef makes lol (kind of a stretch of the imagination). \n\nA normal 2 person party with drinks and sushi will run you about $50-$100; at least it did for me on both occasions. You're billed by the type of plates you grab, prices go as follows: $2.25, $3.25, $4.25, $4.65 and $4.95. When you sit, they give you a paper that shows a picture of each plate so you know what you're grabbing. Grab, eat and stack. Once you're done, the servers will tally the plates and get your bill. Pretty simple process which is probably why parties move in and out fast. The sushi overall seems good and fresh. Some items will go around the conveyor belt many times before getting picked up but overall, pretty satisfied with the flavor and food. \n\nIf you're looking for a great date night or non date night spot that's fun and interactive, come check them out! It's in a great location and offers a great experience.", "author": "Rockne H."}

I thought either it must either be super cheap, super high quality, or super innovative. Unfortunately it was none of the above. Came on a Friday night with a friend who really wanted conveyor belt sushi. I was reluctant but since this place was 4 stars I gave it a chance. In the end I just left disappointed.\n\nI'll say this. The quality isn't bad. The rice has some flavor and fish quality was your normal restaurant quality. But it's definitely not good enough for the price. Ordering is slightly difficult and we failed multiple times just cause of our seating location. The restaurant itself is decently sized but still not huge. \n\nPros:\n-Decent portion sizes so you can get full faster\n-Very nice and attentive service\n-Instant gratification if you're starving\n\nCons:\n-Lacking in options. The conveyer belt basically had a small selection of basic nigiri, a few rolls that were all similar to one another, and an occasional interesting item.\n-Prices suck. Paid almost $60 for my half of the meal. I left full mainly cause everything was full of rice.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for good conveyor belt sushi head to Kula. Otherwise take your money and go to one of the million decent sushi restaurants in the city. I'd only consider coming back if I could be seated right away and I was starving or if I only wanted 2-3 plates.", "author": "Vivian C."}

My friends and I got here around 730 pm and the wait wasn't that bad, maybe only 10 minutes max. However, the place is a bit small so it's best to go here with a smaller group. We sat at the sushi boat and the staff (being incredibly friendly and helpful) immediately filled and refilled our waters and teas maybe three or four times, which in my book is pretty damn good.\n\nI ordered the spicy white tuna and grabbed four other plates off the sushi boat and all of them were delicious! The spicy white tuna wasn't actually that spicy and was more wasabi-spicy than anything, and was very tender and fresh with a yummy sauce on the bottom to douse your tuna in. If you're expecting a very heavy, decadent, American style deep-friend sushi with lots of sauces and crunchy flakes on top then this is not your go to place. Their rolls were much more simple, less heavy on the sauces, and felt more authentic to the actual sushi you'd find in Japan, which I really liked. \n\nThe only thing that I didn't like was that it was uncomfortably stuffy in the restaurant, which is understandable since there's no AC in most places in SF, but nonetheless I was pretty hot and was ready to leave at the end. Overall the food was amazing and pretty cheap (if you watch what you eat/count how many plates you get.. I got 5 and it ended up being almost $30 total including tip. yikes) and the service was great.

We were quickly brought hot tea and water (upon request), which was also much appreciated.\n\nI really liked the sort of old fashioned, waterfront ryokan feel of the restaurant and the old-timey boats that circulate with the sushi on them are much nicer than the alternatives at uber-modern kaiten sushi options around the city.\n\nThe reason this only gets three stars, however, was the lack of food.  I know it was on the later side to have dinner, but if you're serving guests until 10, there should be food on those boats the entire night...\n\nWhen we first sat down, about half of the boats were empty.  Most of the remaining sushi on them - all rolls - was never touched for the remainder of the evening.  I had two servings of spicy raw oysters (four oysters), one serving (two pieces) of BBQ eel sashimi, and one serving (two pieces) of a ginger albacore sashimi within the first 15 minutes of arriving - all from the boats.  However, those were all items that were initially circulating.  In the entire hour we were there, they only added four more plates to the boats.  The rest of the time, the chefs were either cleaning up for the night or pushing out orders that people had placed off of a menu.\n\nFor me, the appeal of coming to a place like this is having the chefs create whatever they want and then getting to see it all and decide what appeals to me.  If I wanted to just order sushi off of a menu, it wouldn't come to a kaiten sushi restaurant.  Yes, everything we did manage to get was really excellent, but I wasn't incredibly full upon leaving because there was hardly any food to choose from.\n\nI imagine if you come earlier, you'd have a lot more selection - but I also imagine that you'd be fighting more people for it / waiting longer for a seat....a real Catch-22!", "author": "Tay H."}

I like this place so much, I almost didn't want to say so on Yelp for fear of making my wait longer next time I go there. They are in the very walkable neighborhood of Castro / Upper Market. On that note, if you can avoid driving here, you're less likely to make yourself insane trying to find parking. \n\nEvery time I've been there, I'm greeted with a smile. If your party is 4 or fewer, I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar, as food comes out fast and often, and just about everything is good. Plus, it comes around on BOATS! Who does't like sushi delivered to you on clever watercraft? \n\nKnow this, even if you're at the sushi bar: If you're a picky eater or just have a hunger for something specific, ask for it. Their sushi chefs are usually pretty cool about making custom rolls to order. Each time I've done that, the food has been very good as well. \n\nIf your party is bigger than 4, you'll probably want to sit in the small dining room toward the back of the restaurant. There you will have access to all the same food you would have at the bar, but you'll be in a less crowded environment.\n\nAlso good to know: They serve ramen. The ramen I've had there is not the best in the city, so if that's what you're craving, you're probably better off going to a ramen-specific restaurant. But if your friends want sushi, and you just can't hang with that, their ramen will suffice in a pinch.", "author": "Brian K."}

I used to be a fiend for it in my youth, but as I get older, the prospect of letting raw fish swoosh through my gullet doesn't appear to generate as much pleasure to my palate. But every once in a while, I do get a motherland craving, and I had heard good things from sushi aficionados about Warakubune. I figured going there may generate good karma since it's located close to the dearly departed No Name Sushi which I used to frequent when I was struggling in my twenties. The place appears hermetically sealed since you can't see their operation from the outside.\n\nOnce you walk in, you are automatically greeted by a pre-recorded \"Irasshaimase!\" and the familiar sushi boat beckons you just like it does at Isobune. The boats were moving quickly in front of me, so I felt a need to do some stretching exercises to make sure I can grab a plate without causing a pile-up of raw fish in the canal. The waitresses buzz by with hot green tea and a hot towel. OK, I'm ready. I started slow with the $3.75 Saba (mackerel) which I haven't had in an eon or two (see photo). It was quite good, so to pace myself, I glanced over to see how quickly others' plates were piling up. The young slackers with the pot bellies next to me had quite a tower of stoneware started, and they didn't look like they were about to finish.\n\nSo I ordered one of their $5.50 house specials, the Unagi Teriyaki, which was a roll of barbecue sea eel doused in teriyaki sauce and topped with avocado and crab meat (see photo). Delicious if a bit on the decadent side. I thought I should have some Uni (sea urchin) to cleanse the palate, and for $3.95, it was nicely smooth and fresh (see photo). Then I went on a tear - the $3.95 Kani Salad (crab meat) satisfied my craving for a bit of crab salad in a roll (see photo), the bargain-price $2.95 Cuttlefish provided a nice chewy texture (see photo),  the $3.95 Maguro (tuna) was essential eating (see photo), and the $4.35 Oysters offered fresh slurpiness.\n\nThe one miss of the bunch was a $4.75 house special of an odd California roll topped with chopped tuna and accompanied by taro prepared like French fries (see photo). It was just weird and I should have known better since several of these creations kept circling in their barges several times without any prospect of a pick-up in the near-term. By the time I found myself feeling sated, I noticed my pile of plates looking embarrassingly tall, so I divided them in half in a hapless attempt to look like I have a bird-like appetite. To her credit, the waitress didn't slap her forehead in utter disbelief, but she may have thought I was that guy from Man Vs. Food.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid sushi for the most part with a few creative misfires\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...I was getting seasick\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...you can find your sushi groove here", "author": "Ed U."}

Let me count this\" \nSo 13 plates and a soda ran me $70 which still to me seems on the overpriced end when the two of us have done more damage for less at another sushi boat place. Reason? This place prices their plates higher. I guess they can get away with it since it's the only sushi boat spot in this area. \n\nWhen you sit down, it's hard to see what's coming around. Reason for that is that the sushi boats are running above table level. So weird. \n\nThe other thing I didn't like was that they were pretty slow to get sushi out. Many boats circled around empty for quite some time and then when they did refill them, it was boring basic stuff (seaweed salad, Inari, California roll). They didn't break out with the good nigiri until later. Had some surprisingly really really good salmon. So good I ordered another 2 and a special albacore nigiri that had ginger and scallion on it for the mister. We both really enjoyed it. Forced him to eat an order of the scallop nigiri even though he said he was full because it just looked so damn good. And ya know what? It was so sweet. Yum.\n\n2 guys next to us were eating out of a massive bowl that was basically a cornucopia of sashimi. I asked myself what the heck is that and why isn't it in my face right now??

I took sashimi from a stranger. It was a hodge podge of everything! Cucumbers, little sweet cherry tomatoes, salmon, maguro, scallop, octopus...  The quality was very good!

I haven't found the wait times to be very long, even if you do choose to dine from the sushi boat seating area. The sushi is decent, but it definitely does cater to less of a traditional taste. You can expect to find some of the more non-standard types of special rolls here, along with some classic favorites like tuna rolls and salmon nigiri. I did realize though that sometimes the sushi does float around for a while, and I question how fresh the fish is after spinning in the boats. Other than that, the food is pretty decent.\n\nIf you do not find what you are looking for, you can also always opt to order specific sushi dishes that you want from the sushi chef. Pricing is coded based on the type of plate you select, so nicer items will generally be more expensive. Service is also attentive enough, and generally pretty friendly as well. I would recommend coming here if you are in the mood for a light meal because it's easy to gauge how much you want to eat since you can just pull it off from the floating boats.", "author": "Daniel H."}

I loved the design of this restaurant as the sushi chefs were in the middle of the sushi boat area so you could watch them prepare the sushi. At other establishments I have seen the boats just float in, but been unable to watch the food preparation which always makes me wonder what is going into the dish. At this restaurant we had the salmon roll, spicy tuna, and tuna roll. sashmi and miso soup. The miso soup was flavorful and the fish in the salmon roll tasted very fresh. I was not a huge fan of the tuna roll as it did not taste as fresh as the other fish. However, the spicy tuna did not have the same taste so I am not sure what the distinctive difference was. We came early, and until four to five groups were seated did not have a lot of variety in the food options. This changed as we stayed longer, but was a little annoying at first.

I walked in at around 8:30pm on a Friday night and it looked like there wasn't much left on the belt expect for some fried sushi pieces and some spicy tuna maki adorned with yam fries.  No seriously, I kept seeing those two circle around and around that I couldn't forget them.\n\nIt doesn't matter because you can just order whatever nigiri you feel like eating.  The only downside to this is that you won't know what specialty dishes they have in their pocket... some which I was able to see later like the seared tuna (which is actually more raw) and then some octopus/zucchini dish that I couldn't snatch my hands on in time.  Conveyor belt is only for the quick of mind and fast reflexed.... otherwise expect yourself to be running for your dish.\n\nNow the crowning moment was when I got the uni.  This is like the creme de la creme of nigiri for me and my dessert to a proper Japanese meal.  The sushi man said that they had only a little bit left, but possibly not enough to make two pieces.  But he scrounged it up and was able to give us two luscious pieces of glory.  It tasted fresh and buttery, just as it's supposed to.\n\nNow don't get all snobby on me because this is a conveyor belt place so treat it as one.

A lot of these types of places have closed in San Francisco and this was the only one I haven't been to. \n\nIt's not necessarily that this place is bad, it's more of the fact that it's overpriced for what they are serving. It honestly looked like everything on the boats were a variation of a California Roll. Basic AND overpriced. \n\nWhen my friend and I first arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday night, we waited about 5 minutes for them to clean up the table that just left. Not too long of a wait, we got lucky. However, they need a better system in terms of remembering who came in first. Maybe a sign-up/ wait list would be helpful or should be utilized because the male server remembered we were there first and the female server tried to seat another couple who walked in minutes after us. \n\nIf you are looking for authenticity, this is not the place. It is run by Chinese people, so it's your typical Chinese Japanese restaurant. I don't have a problem with it, I know what I'm getting myself into. I just couldn't really justify the crazy mark-up for the dishes just because we are in a particular neighborhood. \n\nAround 8pm it got super busy and there was a long wait. Also, you could tell there was a lot more people eating because a lot of the boats would be empty. The sushi chefs couldn't really keep up. \n\nService here is pretty good though. They came by quite quickly to refill tea and my teacup was never empty. \n\nCounting the plates was a little weird. If you and your party are paying together, they line up all the different plates and stack the like ones together. I understand it's easier to count that way, but it's also messy. Some of those plates have sauces and the way they stack the plates on top of each other so quickly made the table so messy and dirty when we had to pay for our check. Is there possibly a cleaner method? \n\nAnyway, this place was fun to try, but I wouldn't really come back unless someone really wanted sushi boat and wanted to hang out in the nearby area.

The nigiri is fresh, the rice is seasoned nicely, and the wasabi is well-apportioned.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this is not the place to get Americanized sushi. Avoid the asparagus tempura roll, or the mayo-covered thing which came with fries, because (1) why would you do that, and (2) those dishes look like they've had a long time to sit on the boat and quietly reflect their fate. This is a place for hamachi, sake, maguro, hirame, ikura, hotate, and maybe a spicy tuna or a California roll (if you must).\n\nThe atmosphere is lively and cozy. We didn't have to wait for a seat, but others did, so you might. (Timing is everything.) You will sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers, and pretend not to eavesdrop, and probably spill a bit of sake on yourself because there isn't a lot of room to pour. \n\nOnce you're sated, the no-nonsense staff will be eager to tally up your bill and move you on, but you'll never feel rushed. You might note that there is, indeed, higher quality sushi somewhere in San Francisco, or that you spilled a bit of sake on your leg because someone bumped your elbow. But the sushi is still very good, the location is convenient, and it is way more fun to take your food from a tiny boat.", "author": "Alex L."}

Judging by the absence of Japanese language on the menu and by the accents of the staff, they are not Japanese. Their serving style is not Japanese (gracious and pleasant) but Chinese (brusque to the point of rude). No refills were offered on water or tea. The sushi was fine but the tempura was disgusting - dense and crunchy like over-fried fish and chips, with only sweet potatoes and a single soggy broccoli - not at all light and delicate and varied in vegetables like true Japanese tempura.

The pricing is different according to whatever plate of sushi you picked. Some of the dishes that stood out were the oysters and the sashimi. I was craving oysters on our trip but I wasn't ready to wait in a long line for them. The oysters were actually pretty fresh and seasoned well. They are still raw but I like it that way with some squeezed lemon on them. We also ordered a sashimi plate (on their actual menu) and their fish was fresh and sliced pretty thick.

Creative in a good way, not Barracuda-first-date-sushi-place- whoa-look-I-put-mango-in-a-sushi-roll-cause-I-don't-eat-nigiri-kinda-way. The nigiri (which can sometimes be a little heavy with wasabi) and sushi here are really delicious. All the usual nigiris are good here with walu or escolar being my favorite. They call it super white tuna, I've had it other places, and I like it here best. The one I like the least, the hotatei cause it has a wasabi bomb in it (I'm guessing to cover the fact that it may have been a frozen scallop at some point). \n\nTheir creative rolls/plates are a nice way to change up your pallet, you might get a little salt overload though. Spicy white tuna, tataki, special roll, all hella good...all hella salty. \n\nI found out about this place probably 4 years ago, and have been coming back probably twice a month since then. That's because the service is great, the staff is nice and the food is genuinely good. It may not be the best or most authentic Japanese food you had (um duh bro, it's owned and operated by Chinese people, but so are many other Japanese places. Warakabune does it right. What can I say, some of my people really know how to imitate good Japanese food), but again IT TASTES GOOD and it's always entertaining to watch what the next sushi boat will bring. If you're sitting at the back tables or here during a slow time when the sushi boats aren't flowing with the good stuff or lack variety, you can always just order. \n\nAnd one last tip, that pretty much everyone who frequents here knows about...if you're really in the mood for fish and salt...get the spicy seafood salad..it's a combination of mixed sashimi, tako, cucumbers, and peppers in a spicy soy sauce...", "author": "Alan C."}

But she also shares some of my guilty pleasures. One of them being Sushi Boat places. I know I know, Sushi boat restaurants typically are never the highest quality place that you'll go to. It's raw fish, so it's best served right after it's made, not floating around on a little boat for every person in the restaurant to gawk at and breathe on before you snatch it up.\n\nThat all being said, I still love my Sushi boat restaurants. Like I said it's a guilty pleasure. It's like a game, hoping that the one plate you really want comes around. The issues of ordering to share are eliminated and you can just sit, talk, drink some sake and enjoy your meal. Once you're done you can sit back and admire your massive stack of plates.\n\nNow that I'm done rambling, for Sushi boat restaurants Warakubune is probably the best quality of the ones in SF. The fish is pretty decent and the service is pretty good too. I actually like the location since it's close to where we are and ironically even though we typically cab it, for some reason we've ended up driving here several times and always seem to find parking within half a block. \n\nThe different Nigiri of salmon, tuna and hamachi were all excellent and the rolls were actually tasty. To be honest much of the sushi was better than I've had at some regular Sushi joints. We also typically order Nigiri or hand rolls that you don't see on the boats which is totally fine.

There WERE some good rolls from the boats. I enjoyed the Tamago http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OZAZSQnvAGeETvoKRSEbuQ?select=ghvZ5Q4L1gtRDx3usFnNzA which tasted a lot fresher that the ones at Sakana Bune. The Kani Salad Roll was tasty as well. The other thing about this place is that they make their rolls very \"tall\". Meaning they pack a LOT of rice. I guess that makes sense because nobody wants to pay almost $4 for a plate and not get a lot of food.\n\nAnyways, parking here was a little more difficult this time. We had to circle around a couple of times and ended up a block away right in from of the Mission Delores Church/Missionary. Overall for the price we paid, I would suggest going to Isobune in the Japantown mall instead. I think they have a lot better selection and their food tastes better as well.", "author": "Mona C."}

So, she investigated some places and found this one. Now when we first tried to go the place was closed so we had to return another night. \n\nWe went on a Saturday night and the sushi looked like it was going fast and being made just as fast. Semi-worried I ordered tempura thinking that it would be an easy out if the sushi wasnt good. Well it looks like I was the loser in that situation because I soon realized that the sushi was AMAZING. Spicy tuna? I burned my tongue on it, it was so spicy.... and that's just what I like.\n\nThe atmosphere was mellow, the bar in which you sit at gives you an opportunity to talk to you neighbors about their sushi choices as well as egg them on the take the sushi they want. \n\nThere was one piece of sushi though... that haunted me the entire time I was there. It was two pieces of Nigiri with succulent crab legs. Every time it would pass I craned my neck to follow the pieces but thought that it just wouldnt be that great. Well people started to leave and so the sushi options got slimmer and slimmer and finally I gave into my primal urges and grabbed the sushi. Thinking that it may have been dry or gross since it had been going around the on boats for so long... i hesitantly bit into the crab. I was delighted to find some of the sweetest juiciest crab I've encounter, and did not expect at a sushi place.\n\nOverall good experience.

So we decied to try it tonight beucase today is my daughter's 5th birthday and she requested \"sushi boat\". \n\nWe were a party of 5. As soon as we walked in there were 4 avaliable seats at the sushi bar/boat bar. So the waiter added another chair. Meanwhile there was a purse sitting on an empty chair that belongs to a woman sitting next to it but she was done eating and is paying. No biggy, we are pretty patient. 5 minutes goes by and the woman is still seated and her purse is still on the empty chair, so I decided I ask the waiter to please let the woman know that my husband will be sitting there and if she can please move her purse. As the waiter was approaching the woman, the man (owner/sushi maker) behind the sushi boats stopped him and said \"don't listen to her\" in cantonese. He must not know that I speak cantonese and knew what he was saying. After I heard what he said it really pissed me off. I wanted to leave then and there but my kids got to the sushi already. My husband decided to ask another waitress and she was able to ask the woman to move her purse.\n\n I had to ignore what I had just heard from the owner and just sit and eat because  I didn't want to ruin my little girl's birthday dinner.  I daughter wanted a spider roll so we ordered her one. At the end of dinner spider roll was nowhere to be found and turns out the waitress forgot to put in the order. Ok fine we'll just cancel it.\n\nDinner was done and now time for cake! I specifically \"boxed\" 5 candles along with the cake. They brought out the cake along with 4 candles on it. If they looked at the cake it said \"Happy 5th birthday Melanie\"! How and why didn't they put 5the candle? Ok 4 candles... fine. We started singing happy birthday and so did the waitress. But here's the craziest part the waitress sang \"happy birthday to Camrin, happy birthday to you\" Um.....my daughter is named Melanie not Camrin...wth...? \n\nMy husband paid the bill not sure how much tips he gave them but if it was up to me they would have got NOTHING and we are fellow restaurant owners.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

Yes, there are boats that float around the sushi bar, and yes you can grab whatever you want. But what happens if you, like me, are seated on the far end of the sushi bar and everyone else takes what you want before it comes around?? Basically it goes like this. \"Oh what is he making in there? It looks so good\" \"I want that when it comes around.\" 20 minutes later it still hasn't gotten to you so you pick one of the unappealing plates that has been circling the moat for hours. And you know what? It still tastes good. but what tastes even better is the good stuff, so try and sit near the sushi door where they put the food on the boats. Then you won't feel so much like a vulture.\n\nOn another note, be careful how many plates you grab here, the price racks up quickly and it is pretty much impossible to check the bill to be sure it is correct.\n\nAll that being said, I love this place and the whole experience.

Thankfully this sushi joint was still open around his area. Upon entering this place, we had no idea it was a sushi boat style restaurant. There were about 6 couples waiting ahead of us in line, so we decided to put on our name on the dry erase board! and checkout another sushi restaurant in the area that was also open. We eventually ended up coming back here. The dry erase board should be a dead give away for divey food ahead!\n\nThe waiter had no clue who was next in line because there was really no order to the dry erase board, and the waiter was not managing it anyway. But thankfully people abide by the honor system here and knew who was ahead of who in line. Eventually, my friend and I were seated on the right hand side away from the door in the sushi boat arena. I have to say, that this could possibly be the worst place to be sat. You will always get the last dibs on all the stuff that is created, so try to be seated on the left side, the side closest to the door. \n\nIf you've never done sushi boat before, it's not hard, you just pull sushi off of a boat tray. haha. the sushi pieces are on smaller trays that are marked by a design and correspond to a price. my friend really does not like sushi boats for one big reason, these pieces of sushi are floating around for some time so they are not fresh, and you don't know if someone from across the way has picked it up, sneezed on it, and then decided oh no wait i don't want it and then puts it back. It could and probably does happen!\n\nI had about 7 trays of sushi, but they were not exactly what I wanted. There were some very good pieces of Salmon nigiri. The pieces were very thick. Also of note, the Wasabi that they use here, is extra potent so be careful! For the 7 trays it came out to 23 dollars.

However, Warakubune seems to be a nice exception! \nWe decided to get there when they opened, owing to the reviews that mention how crowed it can get later. (Like clock work, around 7 or so, it was starting to get crowed) The waiters were hyper attentive, bordering on the edge of ridiculous, which I never thought I'd complain about! \n\nSelection: \nPretty solid! In the beginning, the sushi chefs started making the cheaper plates of california rolls (~$1.95) and then moved on to more expensive ones, like the super delicious but also super stomach-filling roll with shrimp tempura and avocado on top (I think it was a $3.95-4 plate). They also made sushi on request, but we stuck to the floating boats. Between the two of us each having about ten plates in total, one large beer and a small cold sake, it came to ~$50 with tip. Not bad for a sushi bar in a nicer spot like the castro. \n\nUltimately, it's all about strategy if you want to get the rolls you want, because by the time it started filling up, we couldn't get our hands on any newer rolls. Which was fine, because it gave us time to enjoy some sake and listen to their techno soundtrack. \n\nMy only complaint is that I wish the waiters wouldn't stand right behind me waiting for my tea cup to be empty.

YES.\n\nWe had a group of around 12 and even though we took up half of the restaurant they were able to seat us pretty quickly.  2 other groups of people were leaving as we were coming in.  We had been out drinking and really pigged out and the bill came to just a bit over $300.  I have spent that with one other person on sushi before.\n\nThe waiter was extremely accommodating.  One of the people in our party asked for a specific roll and the chef made it for him.  The waitress, Sandy, was extremely nice and brought everything we asked, Sake, gyoza, edemame, etc and served us quickly and efficiently.\n\nI had the following I can remember Philadelphia roll (OK), Spicy Tuna Roll (Pretty Good), scallop nigiri (excellent, perfect balance of sweetness and the kick from the wasabi with some lemon), Dragon Roll (probably the best dragon I have had, really freshly fried shrimp, sweet and spicy, yum), a couple of the maki rolls with salmon and tuna, maguro nigiri, fried rice inari and one or two others.

Here are some of the things we had:\n\nOysters - delicious and fresh\nSeaweed salad - yummy and good way to satiate your appetite while waiting for your custom ordered rolls\nSpider Roll - good but the one they made for us was poorly constructed (it was made too fat so the nori roll didn't quite overlap enough to stay together)\nNigiri - all the pieces we had featured super fresh, pristine-looking pieces of fish. \n\nI would definitely come here again but next time I think I'm going to make sure we have a snack first.

I don't usually fancy sushi - really have to find myself in the mood - but my boyfriend loves it.  Warakubune seems to be the perfect marriage of our tastes, with tasty, affordable sushi and delicious alternatives.  I've gotten a chicken dish and the spicy soup (I wanted the spicy ramen but they were out when I went).  The chicken dish was fine, nothing great, but that spicy soup is one of the tastiest dishes I've ever eaten.  I get cravings for that stuff.  I highly recommend you try it, or drag your friends along who, like me, aren't huge on sushi but like other Japanese foods.\n\nI will say that I wanted to try their California rolls, which are bargain priced and made with real crab.  I usually don't like California rolls too much, but the allure of real crab at for the price was irresistible, and I was handsomely rewarded.  This was easily the best a California roll has tasted to me, made much the better by the low low cost.  Sushi aficionados may disagree with my assessment, but for my tastes, the California roll at Warakubune is a must-add item.\n\nMy one gripe with the place is that the service is a little weak.  I've never been totally ignored or forgotten like some people seem to have been, but there could definitely have been more attention paid.  That said, the staff was also able to seat me quickly when I went both times, each time in a group of no less than six.  They had no qualms about pulling some tables together to find us a place, and I really appreciate that.  The rest of the service felt a little sparse, but not enough to truly put a damper on the rest of the experience.\n\nThe decor is lovely and exciting, and they've got sushi boats - how fun!

I have to admit, we were a little disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to say, the fish was good enough.  It was fresh, and cold, and the portions were generous.  But, for sushi, it was also a little messy.  The chefs seemed to be in a huge hurry, just slamming the food out fast-food style and getting it onto the boats.  The prices also seemed all over the place.  There are 4-5 color-coded plates (priced from $1.95 to $3.95) but we never saw a $1.95 plate go around and the $3.95 plates were quite common.  We did enjoy the much recommended asparagus roll, but everything else was just...meh.\n\nMaybe I'm a little spoiled living in the Pacific Northwest, with amazing sushi practically at my doorstep.  To me, Warakubune was ok, but the fish was not amazing and the presentation was harried.  It also bugged me that they didn't seem to be keeping a close eye on the length of time their raw dishes were sitting on the boats.  For example, there were raw oysters on the boats when we arrived, and the same oysters were still going around the moat when we left nearly an hour later.

It can difficult to be seated for a group that is larger and having a conversation with anyone but the person next to you is kind of impossible.\n\nThis really isn't the place for a sushi purist.   Sushi on the boats are often covered with a spicy or creamy sauce. If you like crunchy rolls with tempura or avocado you will be happy here. There are several vegetarian roll options on the menu and on the boats along with seaweed salad and inari.\n\nI would rate service as pretty poor because it is difficult to get a waiter's attention and they weren't refilling green tea or refreshing ginger and wasabi promptly.\n\nI think the sushi is a little over priced for the quality of rolls you are getting but is pretty average for a casual sushi dinner in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-12", "description": "You walk in and see the sushi bar - an oval shaped donut with seats around it and a sushi chef in the middle making magic.  Take a seat to begin your sushi-eating experience.   Floating in front of you in water are actual boats with small rectangular plates of sushi.  Something catch your eye? Take it. The chef keeps making rolls and placing them out on the float; you keep grabbing what looks appetizing - and the cycle continues. It's too easy. \n\nFavorites included the spicy white tuna roll encrusted with sesame seeds and with ginger and green onions on top.  They have a delicious oyster plate that comes with sriracha, lemon, and green onions.  Also, their hot sake was full of flavor and they provide complimentary green tea - not particularly nutty but still tasty, hot, and aplenty.\n\nWhen you start to slow down and are no longer eating because you're hungry but instead grabbing a 14th plate because it just looks so good and you don't want to watch it go by, it's a sign you should flag down a waiter.  They'll count the number of plates in front of you to determine how much to charge.  Each dish costs somewhere between $2 and $4.5.  The two of us spent $60 before tip and that included a small and large sake.  We left very full. \n\nPotential con of the experience: it can be hard to know what you are eating.  The dishes aren't labeled and you'll find yourself choosing food based on appearance.  If you're picky, it will take guesswork and an ability to recognize different types of fish to know what you are getting - but I actually enjoyed the element of surprise and was never disappointed by any of our choices. \n\nOverall, this was a wonderful first sushi boat experience.  While the fish quality was not as good as Sushi Zone down the street (beating Sushi Zone would not have been an easy feat), Warakubune's offerings were delicious and the atmosphere warm and lively;  I definitely look forward to returning.", "author": "Kimya P."}

They offer a variety of interesting sushi to choose from.  The wait staff is attentive and offer many cups of tea. The wasabi and pickled ginger comes you in your own dish, which is a lot cleaner and sanitary.  The crispy pork Katsu dinner is generous and filling.

First I'll start with the good: the food is decent. I have no complaints about the food; I ordered the katsu dinner, and it was good. Nothing special, but nothing terrible either.\n\nThe thing that made this dinner so unpleasant was the service. We didn't order anything too complicated....so I have no idea why the server got so much wrong. My friend wanted the spicy udon, but somehow got regular udon with tempura on the side. My sister ordered a spicy tuna handroll, which they COMPLETELY forgot about until we reminded them at the end of the dinner, and then they said we never ordered it. All throughout the dinner, the servers NEVER came over to refill our tea OR water, so we were parched the entire dinner. Then, when the bill came, we realized that they charged us for miso soup that we didn't order....they just brought us the miso soup and we thought it came with our entrees, so we drank it, not realizing it cost extra. \n\nAnd it wasn't just our table; they kept making mistakes at the table next to us too. During the hour or hour and a half we were eating there, I noticed that they brought the next table food they didn't order, forgot 2 orders, and never refilled their tea or water either. \n\nBy the end of the dinner, the service was so terrible that it was starting to become comical how much they were messing up.

A trough with cute floating sushi boats separate the diners from the two chefs confined inside the oblong-shaped bar, rolling out nigiri sushi and maki rolls onto the boats. As you wait to be seated at the bar of this somewhat popular establishment, you'll start eyeing the sushi atop the boats and possibly drool a little.  Let's face it, any food on tiny little boats that go round and round is nothing short than adorable.\n\nThe excitement builds up, but as soon as you're seated at the bar you'll discover how lackluster the selections are. Tofu products, maimed cuts and who knows what under some drippy sauce are what you can expect to get at Warakabune. Sure you can special order from the menu, but that would defeat the mission of sushi boating. It's amazing how cute little boats dress up Warakabune's mediocre sushi, kind of like what a great pair of jeans would do to one's otherwise flabby ass.\n\nWarakabune is not for the sushi purists.

Nothing really had any taste. There were big cuts, but everything tasted the same. Like yellowtail I love and I am sort of used to it having a tougher texture around the ends and really good flavor. I didn't get any of these qualities from the yellowtail I was served.

The sushi bar has actual sushi boats going round and round...and you just grab sushi off the boats.  Oh wow! I quickly learned from my dinner companions that this is common for sushi restaurants in SF.  Why, oh why have they not brought this concept to Chicago?\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't have room for my party of 10 around the sushi bar, but we quickly scored a large table in the back.  I was a little disappointed not to be sitting where I could grab sushi off the boats, but our waitress assured us that we could push our way through the people sitting at the sushi bar (sorry to all those peeps) and help ourselves- I love this place!\n\nI quickly made my way through 4 small plates of sushi, a miso soup, and some edaname. It wasn't the best sushi I've had on the West Coast (I prefer Ryoko here in SF), but it still put a smile on my face.", "author": "Andrea R."}

Huge hunks of assorted  fresh fish in a bowl of yummy soy/sesame dressing and avacado slices.  Great deal at $20 and totally Atkins, South Beach diet friendly.  My advise is to split the salad and  grab a few boats as they float to carry you through your Sunday night.  Top off with a mongo sized Sapporo and you have yourself an affordable raw meal.  \n\nAs with everywhere else in this chilly city, I won't be taking off my jacket, but its worth it to go for a cruise at a Warakubune.", "author": "Nicole R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-25", "description": "I walked to warakubune and I was hot because I was walking pretty far and fast.  then I opened the door to this place and it was really hot inside.  Ok, no air conditioning, that's for sure.  A little gnat or something kept buzzing at my nose and that was annoying, but you know, when there are a lot of fish around, like fish guts in the trash, then it is bound to happen.  \n\nSo this place has sushi boats.  A lot of California rolls.  A bad sign that the customers don't really like real nigiri sushi or raw fish for that matter.  So i got the sushi dinner special.  Some of the fish was really delicious.  The rice sucked, it didn't seem like proper sushi rice and when I dipped it into the soy sauce they just fell apart.  Also there was not enough rice being used.  Is rice really that expensive?  \n\nThe ebi I had was really lame and looked like it had been through hell, it was really chewy and rubbery, didn't seem fresh at all.  So I decided I would try their amaebi (raw ebi) nigiri sushi.  It was just fine, not the best I have had, but yummy.  Not as sweet or as large as some amaebi I have had at other restaurants.  \n\nThe chef asked me if I wanted the head of the shrimps fried so I said yes.  It took awhile but it was totally worth the wait.  They even brought me a little bowl of tempura dipping sauce to dip the shrimp heads in.  No way, I have never seen a place do that before, but I thought it was an awesome touch!  The heads of the amaebi were delicious, like shrimp flavored Pringles, lol.  \n\nSo in a nutshell, as far as sushi boat places go I prefer Isobune in SF's Japantown for a sushi boat type of place.  Sorry Warakubune.  I would go back there someday, but I even prefer Miyabi also on Church St. over this place.  \n\nStaff was friendly, decor was fine (I like this fish on the wall).  They filled my water and tea promptly and I appreciate that a lot.   \n\nOne couple came in right before me and I think they were upset they didn't get menus or they didn't like the looks of what was on the sushi boat and they left without eating anything.  Then later six people came in to eat but not enough seats, so they had to wait.  Then a couple came in after them and they decided the place wasn't worth the wait and left.  Then after that a lot more people came in...busy place for a Wednesday night.  \n\nSo yeah, that's my review, it about says it all.  Prices were medium/low for s suhi place.", "author": "Cynthia B."}

We would have sat at the sushi bar, but it was full.  The sushi was pretty fresh and tasty - but the service???  What service.  Very disappointed.  We left with full stomachs (just two of us), only drank water & tea and did not leave a tip as it was not deserved.  The bill was only $31.

Instead, try three pieces at a time.\n\nOne of the best parts of Warakubune is the layout. You sit in a large oval, boats carrying sushi rolls travel counter clockwise in front of you. Two sushi chefs stand in the middle making their selection of rolls or just about any roll a customer requests.\n\nWhat I love about the layout is the community it builds. I love sushi but I am by no means an expert at what is what, but at Warakubune, it is inevitable that someone on my left or right is. Every time I have visited I have been given tips on the best rolls to pick up and even had a few customers make orders for me. You won't get that at a regular sushi restaurant.\n\nI challenge you to go to Warakubune and not see a regular. The fact that regulars even exist showcase the restaurants quality fish, talents and customer service. \n\nSo far I haven't had anything but wonderful experiences at Warakubune. The sushi is delicious, the chefs friendly, the staff is quick to refill a glass or pick up an order of miso soup or vegetable tempura. They know their regulars and sell the biggest bottles of Sapporo I've ever seen.\n\nSounds like an all around winner to me!", "author": "Justin S."}

We showed up at 7pm and snagged up the last two seats. Boy, was it full and crowded at the sushi boat counters. We noticed some tables in the back room but it was empty, I guess you can order from their menu but if you want sushi boat, it's just not fun sitting in the \"back room.\"\n\nWe had salmon nigiri (we snapped it before it was even placed on the boats as soon as the chef finished slicing the fish), crab sushi, salmon sushi and a few other plates. Bf felt like some vegetable udon, it came with a nice broth and was tasty. We eyed our neighbor's dish which was this plate filled with lots of fish and sauce. He pointed to the Daily Specials Board and it was called the spicy seafood salad. We ordered a plate ($14), it was worthwhile since it had so many different slices of fish (salmon, tuna, octopus, hamachi, etc) but the sauce was a teeny bit sour and it wasn't at all spicy but worth a try. \nWe'll definitely be back, the caterpillar roll looked good!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-01", "description": "Five of us went out to dinner last night (Sunday) and decided to try this place. We were all starving, having toured the city all day.  The front part of the place has a sushi boat eating area, but we opted for a table instead. The guy sat us down, dropped down menus and then briskly walked away.  There was hardly enough room for the 5 of us at this table so we used the adjacent table for the 2-person overlap. One of the servers seemed to have a problem with this seating arrangement and asked us why we could not sit together at just the one table. Really?!  Since there was no possible way to do this w/o sitting on one another's lap, he suggested we move to another table that was slightly bigger.  Okay, so this was our first warning sign to head for the hills.\n\nOn the way to the restroom to wash up, I noticed that the bathrooms were located way too close to the dining area--I guess this is alright since this joint was so small and the fact that real estate is sky-high in S.F.  Since both doors were locked, a member of our group asked a worker if we needed a key and he said something like \"I don't think so\" and simply walked away (we all should have done the same at this point).\n\nOkay, so there are 5 of us, but we only had 2 menus? Go figure. So, we finally got somebody's attention to please have some more menus, which they did bring, but only 1 more. Luckily, we all like each another enough to sit close to peek over at each other's menu.  If we knew we'd sit this close perhaps we should have kept the first table after all. \n\nRoom temp water/Diluted green tea/ Even waterier wasabi\nWe all drank water, which came to us lukewarm and seemingly straight out of the tap, but we noticed that others seated at the sushi boat area had ice in their water glasses. Though a very generously sized tea pot was set in the middle of our table, but we were all taken aback from the very diluted-down tea.  Each person received a little dish for soy sauce that had wasabi and ginger on top, but sadly, most of the wasabi was reduced to a runny-green puddle...should I continue?  Sure, why not.\nNow is when things go from bad to worse.\n\n\"A Sticky situation\" \nAlright, you think we should have ran out the front door screaming when we noticed that everything was \"adhering\" (including our arms) to the table. I'm not kidding! The soy sauce, menus, and almost everything else were seriously crazy-glued to the table.  It was so bad that more than one of us had to use a napkin to fashion a \"mock\" placemat. \nNot too many choices on the menu, especially the sushi.  My impression is that this place caters to their sushi boats and not so much the table diners?\nNow for the miso soup, which was not hot, but rather warm and pretty sub-par. My mom (who is Japanese) says that you can always tell the quality of a good Japanese restaurant based on their miso soup.  Well, lo and behold, this soup just plain sucked! ALWAYS listen to mom and you'll save yourself a lot of distress!\nOur orders finally arrive...and yeah, their service is also not very prompt here and lackluster at best.  Each dinner entr\u00e9e came with salad that was wilted and don't get me started on their funky salad dressing! It was just not good and way too sweet. Three out of five of us had the tonkatsu chicken/pork with curry.  It was not awful except that the curry sauce was placed on top of the tonkatsu and the pieces were already soggy before reaching our table.  One member of our group had a bowl of pork donburi, which he seemed to enjoy.  Another person had chicken teriyaki, which she said wasn't very tasty.  We also ordered a few 3-piece sushi including avo-maki, Ca. roll and the salmon special.  I'll admit, nobody really disliked what they had for the sushi. \n\nI must admit that the service stepped up when it came to our water glasses being filled, which was very often, BUT the person's water-pouring technique was really poor and many times, water was splashed out onto the table or onto us.  Oh well!  Thank goodness the water wasn't ice cold.\n\nBottom line is save yourself the trouble and look into eating elsewhere or perhaps give the sushi boats a try...Do whatever floats your boat.

I ordered it as is to try it this time; I plan to order it with sauce on the side next time.\n\nSpiciness level: I consider myself a moderate consumer of spicy and couldn't taste it at all. I preferred it that way. There are jalapenos in the bottom of the bowl if you want a real kick.  A doesn't eat spicy foods and thought the spiciness was noticeable. \n\nSushi is average. Keep in mind that as I'm not a huge fan of sushi, I tend to consider it all average. Service is very good. As commented, they are prompt about filling your tea and water. When we came here right when they opened at 5pm, there were no sushi on the boats yet, but we enjoyed having the restaurant to ourselves. There's a whiteboard to sign up for seats when they're busy, and they can get pretty crowded. Seating is around the boats or in the back room.", "author": "Yan E."}

First off, since it was our first time we did not know how or what to order.  I flat out said, \"Yeah we'll have the sashimi spicy white tuna\"  the waiter asked which one and I was stumped but he helped out and said do you want the one with the mayonnaise sauce, green onions and tomato?  My boyfriend said...\"yeah yeah we'll try that\" not knowing if it was the right one.  Holy!! I usually don't take chances like that but wow that Spicy white tuna was melt-in-my-mouth good!!!!!!\n\nWith the seafood salad, I again did not know and just ordered the \"seafood salad\" and he had these questions describing it and my boyfriend again said \"yeah that's it, we'll have that too.\" Scooooore!  It was chunks of raw fish and octopus in a vinegary sauce with cucumbers, avocados, tomatoes and sesame seeds....to die for! For $18.95 I thought it was money well spent!\n\nThe easiest to order was the special roll and that was really really good but I think it was the sauce and the avocado together with the roll that made it tastes reallly good.\n\nMy advice is to not sit at the bar where the sushi boats are, I like made to order things and you'd probably end up spending less than what you might rack up on that boat!", "author": "Mary-Anne C."}

The staff is very accommodating and for sushi fans you can even pre-order specialty items in advance.\n\nSome of their regular item must haves that might be called the same elsewhere but different and better at Warakubune are : white tuna sashimi, albacore takaki, fatty albacore, crab nigiri, salmon nigiri, salmon skin roll, unagi hand roll or nigiri, house special roll, scallops and mussels. \n\nThe staff are very attentive and willing to take special orders. Most importantly Bengi, the head sushi chef and manager is very careful in his preparation.  It's like watching an artist at work.  Although most items go immediately I have seen him throw out sushi on the rare occasion it sat for a several minutes.  \n\nThe ambiance is nice and inviting.

The food that was brought out from the kitchen (oysters, seafood salad, seaweed salad) were all extremely solid and good.

Within about a 5 block radius of my old house were approximately 10 good sushi restaurants.  This place was the best.  It was in a close tie with another neighborhood sushi restaurant which lost it's best sushi chef (of course he was Korean, why do you ask?), so there's not even a contest now.  \n\nAn old friend and I ate here often, and when we did, we could barely waddle out the door at the end of our meal, leaving in our wake stacks and stacks (and stacks) of trays from the sushi boats.  In fact, when he brought his Japan-born-and-raised sister-in-law, she declared that it was the best she's ever had.\nEvery time but one, I sat at the counter with the sushi boats.  Not only is it fun, but you get instant gratification, and who doesn't love instant gratification?  \n\nIf what you want isn't coming by on the boats, (it just might be because I'm sitting upstream from you and I wanted it more!) you can order directly from the chef or even from a waiter/waitress.  Trust me and sit at the sushi boats counter.  You'll enjoy it, and you might be intrigued enough by something you see to try a new item.\n\nDo have that one food item by which you initially judge a new restaurant?  For me it's Kung Pao Chicken for a Chinese restaurant, a Reuben for a deli, Tom Ka Gai for Thai and for sushi, it's unagi.\n\nThis restaurant serves the unagi by which all other unagi is to be judged.\nI've never found better unagi anywhere.  I've found some which comes close enough to pass muster on the restaurant, and allow me to continue eating there, but this is the ultimate. (Pardon me while I drool a bit).  The eel is fresh, firm, perfectly cut, grilled to perfection, with just the right amount of their exquisite sauce brushed onto it and served up hot.  It's firm, yet melts in your mouth almost before your lips touch it.  Their anago is almost as good. \n\nMy second favorite dish here, the other one for which I will swim upstream past your chair to get to it before you can?  Their tempura asparagus roll.  I'm not kidding, it's amazingly good.  Start with fresh asparagus, coat it in tempura batter, deep fry it lightly, but keep it crisp, put it in a rice and nori roll and slather the unagi sauce all over it and you have a wonderfully flavored vegetable roll.\n\nTheir spicy tuna is not the mangled, chopped sesame oil filled gooey mess that you get in some places.  It's the whole pieces of fresh tuna with a good spicy sauce (I believe they use the Vietnamese chili garlic sauce known as \"Sriracha Chili Sauce\").\n\nAll of their other dishes are wonderful.  I ate there often and can't remember ever having any portion of a bad meal or service.  \n\nYes everyone raves about the Spicy White Tuna and it is wonderful (and expensive), but I always came here for the simple sushi, and no one does it better.", "author": "Bill T."}

When I came here, my friends and I were starving, so we opted to skip the wait for the packed sushi boats and sit in the small, but empty seating area in the back.  I was kind of sad to miss out on the sushi boat experiences of trying new items, but sitting in the back afforded us all to sit and talk with each other in our own cozy corner.  \n\nAfter looking at all the yelp reviews, we had to get the spicy seafood salad.  We ordered it as an appetizer to share among our group.  The seafood chunks were huge and fresh, you could tell that they weren't just giving you scraps.  I personally think it looks more beautiful than it tastes - the sauce lends a kind of citrusy taste to the dish, that I wish hadn't been there.  Actually, had it been without the sauce, so I could just dip it in soy sauce and wasabi, I think I would have enjoyed it even more.  But a huge dish with avocados, cucumber, grape tomatoes, and an assortment of fresh seafood ranging from yellowtail, to tuna, to salmon, to octopus....I'm not going to complain.\n\nAs for the sushi, everything was fresh and the cuts of fish on the nigiri and sashimi are huge!  I had the spicy tuna roll, hamachi, hotate, and unagi nigiri.  The spicy tuna roll, definitely had a kick to it, but was very tasty.  The hotate nigiri was a large slice of scallop, very tender, but still not as buttery as I would have liked, but good nevertheless.  Hamachi, you can never go wrong with.  But definitely get the unagi - it was warm, huge, tender, and dripping with sauce (that's what she said).", "author": "AJ P."}

I had to ask more than once.\n\nThat said, the food was GOOD. They was a good options of veggie maki, as well as Inari (mmm), and the fish eaters all praised the various rolls.  One person had some sashimi that she said melted in her mouth.  When the boats were full, it was awesome...however, about half the time, there was a lull, and only the same 3 items that had been going around for an hour (seriously, at some point, take them off!) were available.

I used to frequent Isobune in Burlingame about 20 years ago when it served fresh sushi in a great environment. I found something that comes close to that in Warakubune Sushi. \n\nI went to Warakunbune on a Saturday evening. We arrived early around 5:30 and surprisingly it wasn't very crowded. There was only two other parties, about 6 people. To my surprise, there wasn't any sushi on the boats yet. If your a sushi rookie, this might have presented a problem since you would have had to order directly from the sushi chef. Though during the course of our stay, sushi was added to the boats. By the time we left, the boats were mostly full. \n\nOf course, the sushi boat experience is good for those who might be intimidated to sit and order at a traditional sushi bar. The sushi was pretty traditional Nigiri-type rolls; so if you're looking for some exotic combination roll, you won't find it on the menu. (though like any sushi bar, you can probably order it). \n\nSushi Freshness: 7.5 (1-Won't eat; 5 - what you would find at Safeway; 10 - to die for). The sushi was fresh. \n\nSushi Creativity: 5 (1- Typical nigri rolls; 5 - typical nigri rolls plus some unique ones; 10 - Many different rolls). On the boats its mostly nigri-type rolls. \n\nService: 9 - No wait for seating at 5:30! Promptly filled my tea cup and water glass (maybe to the point of annoyance. But that's better than dying of thirst with no one to be found!) One plus is that when I finished my ginger (you know the one that comes in a small dish with Wasabi) they gave me more ginger without asking! I havent had that happen except when I'm sitting at a sushi bar. \n\nCleanliness: 9 - Overall the restaurant seemed clean. I didn't use the restroom to judge those. \n\nOverall: Great restaurant. \n\ni would defiantly come back here. I would recommend Warakubune for people who want to try sushi and maybe are a bit intimidated about sitting at a sushi bar and not knowing what to order.

When we entered, we sat at the sushi bar - best place to sit since the boats are what you come there for.\n\nSelection, I would say, isn't as big - they have the basics that you'd find at all sushi places: maguro, hamachi, sake and others. When we got there, there were no boats floating around - at ALL. Minus one star. We waited and waited but no new boats came around, only the red/green tobiko came around several times - don't know how long those stayed there but they were still there when we left.\n\nWe ended up ordering straight from our server who was very sweet and pleasant. Our tea cups were instantly filled once they even appeared to be empty. The sushi came out pretty quickly, straight from the chef. They were huge, cold and pretty fresh pieces, though the rice didn't stick together and tasted bland - not a very good sign.\n\nBesides the preparation of the rice, the nigiri tasted pretty good and pretty fresh too. Apparently they also had oysters too that night but ran out that same night. The bf had this tuna/mayo/ponzu/spicy sauce salad thing, which looked really scary to eat but was soo good, he had 3 orders! Prices were fair and probably pretty good considering the size of the sushi.\n\nFour stars overall because the female server said I was pretty. She totally won me over.

Dont get me wrong though, also very good.\nUnagi was very good, I dont know why other places have such crappy tasting unagi.\nThey had like a tuna tataki? a mixture of thigns on it. Quite tastey also.\nThey had this roll topped with a lil spicy tuna and taro fries, interesting but very good.\nWe saw this fried ball thing and didnt know waht it was, turned out to be fried shrimp siumai hahahahaha, thought that was funny that was good too but of course, since its fried hahaha.\nHad some others, cant really remember but it doesnt matter. It was all very very good. And topped it off with a big bottle of Sapporo~\n\nWe also had the tamago to end it all with, I have to say their tamago was good but it could of been better...but they do make their own tamago so that actually says a lot about this place. A lot of places out there use packaged tamago. You see I'm quite picky when it comes to tamago, I'm a tamago guy....And since I've already been subjected to Tani's heavenly tamago, my standards on tamago are very high hahahaha\n\nOverall this place is by far the best sushi boat joint in San Francisco. I wont go to any other sushi boat. Their service was quick and polite and nice. That tall gentleman with glasses even came by and asked how everything was. Look now, remember I'm talking about sushi boat, I'm not comparing this place to Koo and all those other places. Its effing sushi boat. Dont compare two different things, its like apples and oranges. \n\nFor a sushi boat joint this is my top pick!! Puts a smile on my face this big   ^_________________^", "author": "phillip w."}

Add in an out of town guest who has celiac disease, and therefore has problems with soy sauce (luckily he had has gluten free bottle with him) and a boyfriend who abhors seafood (wtf), and it sounds like sushi is a weird idea. but the seafood-o-phobe picked the place... so you'd reckon there is something for him to eat.\n\nBeing a sunday night at almost 8:30PM it was busy but not packed - we had to wait a scant 5 minutes to fit our part of four at the bar. It's a relatively small place, and the boat line is not very long, so most of the food doesn't spend much time spinning before it is gulped down. The fish was all very fresh and tasty. Stand out items were the unagi (which we had to special order - but worth it), and the albacore. \n\nIs this awesome sushi? No. Is it very good sushi? Yes! And it's relatively cheap, and when there is not a long line, a quick meal. The staff is very nice, too.", "author": "neil c."}

I like the warm stuff myself and then get yourself the following:\n\n1. Spicy White Tuna\n\nLittle chunks of yellow fin tuna served with baby cherry tomatoes and a great spicy mayo like dressing.  Now with fish this fresh and tasty I would usually say let go of the sauce and eat it naked but the dressing they use here is well matched to the fish.  The freshness of the tuna means that it stands out against the delicately spiced sauce and once the tuna melts away your taste buds will be rewarded with a little sweet heat that cleans everything down for the next mouthful.\n\n2. Tempura Special Roll\n\nOk so it is tempura fried shrimp, wrapped in sushi rice, then avocado and doused in some more of the delicious spicy sauce from above.  I don't think anything else needs to be said other than make sure you get an end piece before anyone else does.\n\n3. Asparagus Special Roll\n\nTempura fried asparagus wrapped in sushi rice then some nori.  Sounds simple but the freshness of the veggies and the saltiness of the nori makes a match made in heaven.\n\n4. Tatake\n\nCrazy good marinated fatty tuna, sliced deftly and laid over a well cooked ball of rice.  I sometimes like to get this as a sashimi piece but whichever way you slice it the freshness can't be beat.\n\nSo here is the best bit, I can't remember the last time I paid over $25 a head for anything less than a very full belly!  \n\nWarakabune rocks.", "author": "Tony S."}

This was a disappointing experience and I am surprised by the good reviews.\n\nThe service was awful. In fact, while I was sitting, a couple came in and were asked to wait. There were clearly several seats open but for some reason, they were not seated. I saw the servers walking back and forth but they didn't seem to be unusually busy. The couple finally walked out after standing there having been ignored for about 10-15 minutes. \n\nUnless what I wanted was floating by on a sushi boat, it took forever to get anything (cup of water, menu, check, etc.). The uni (sea urchin) did not seem very fresh, so I wondered if that rumor that \"specials\" are actually things the chef wants to get rid of before they go bad is true. When I pay extra for a \"special\" I do expect it to be very good, silly me.  I then ordered amaebi (sweet raw shrimp). When the server brought the amaebi to me, he told me that instead of the regular price on the menu, the amaebi would be more expensive that night, because it was \"special amaebi.\" I don't know why he didn't mention that when I ordered it - wouldn't that have made more sense? Anyways, it tasted fine but nothing extraordinary. I have no idea why I was charged extra.\n\nThe sushi boat offerings were skimpy and the reason I ordered off the menu was that the same, unappealing items kept floating by.

While I'm sure one can find higher \"quality\" sushi, even though that means something different to everyone, Warakabune offers delicious rolls at reasonable prices.  \n\nPerhaps I prefer this joint to others because I am not afraid of going in there hungry.  I know very well that I can eat 8 plates off the sushi boats and not break the bank.  And when there is no wait, nothing is better than just sitting down and eating right away.  If you happen to have a hankering for miso soup, sake, or a special roll, the waiters are always there and very easy to flag down.  \n\nTo top off the great experience, they give the option of writing-up individual bills.  This is amazing when out with friends as there doesn't have to be that inevitable person that ends up paying out the difference between the bill and what people have offered.", "author": "Dylan D."}

I've been here a few times and each time their quality in sushi was consistent. The parking situation can be quite difficult at times, it's all a competition btwn them and many other businesses and local residents, it really depends on your luck...we typically have to park on a average of two blocks away each time, but it's a nice neighborhood so we don't really mind the walk. Every time we come here, there's always a wait...they have a dry erase board by the door where you can write your name down. Average wait time is about 15 minutes. There is basically one big area for sushi boats up front and a small area for table-seating in the back right by the bathroom and kitchen. The seats around the sushi boats were quite packed...there isn't really much space btwn you and the person next to you...you can literally hear everybody's conversation around you.   \n\nI am typically a happy camper when I come here. I mean, I come hungry and there's food ready right in front of me all-I-can-eat! What more can I ask for?! The sushi are yummy. Really made fresh and made with fresh ingredients. Like I've said before, I have been here more than once and they ARE consistent with the quality of food. I really like their unagi, kani (made with real crab meat), ebi, fresh raw oysters, and spicy tuna rolls. They are simply delicious. I don't really eat raw food so I don't eat sashimi...but the ones that I see look really fresh as well. I would highly recommend their sushi here. \n\nService is usually decent here. Things get cleaned up quick, orders get filled fast, and of course getting the bill was THE fastest. Usually I have no complaints, but there was one thing that bothered me this visit. It was that I almost got ran over by the same busboy/waiter twice and he did nothing about it. I know he is doing his job very well by attending to everyone's needs, but still, don't run me over TWICE when your doing it and not even acknowledge it! A simple \"excuse me\" would've been nice! I HATE RUDE PPL!! I think they really should have better training on their waiters as far as it comes to attitude and manners. A successful business is not just about it's food, but it's about it's services as well. In this case, they didn't really deliver and that's why they only deserved 4 stars.", "author": "Winnie L."}

You might have to wait a while for a certain dish but for a first timer, it's a great way to try new items you'd never think about. The items are a great price for the amount of fresh fish they offer. \n\nNow, I wish I could make it out there sometime soon. I can't stop thinking about the food.

Got there pretty early (a little before 6:00).  so the place was fairly empty.  they seated us right away at the sushi boat bar, which I wasn't really expecting, but when in Rome.  We had to ask for their menu with entrees etc.  And there it was.. donburi!!  They have several donburi selections.  We go the tekka and sake.  They were both delicious.  The fish tasted very fresh.  The cuts of sake were very tasty... tender and fatty.  And the rice was perfectly seasoned.  Yeah they serve one grape tomato as garnish (saw one reviewer complain about that), but c'mon.  It's garnish.  That's like complaining bc your steak came out with a sprig of parsley.  We also started chowing down on the sushi that was rotating before us.  Kind of hard not to when you are starving.  have to say, was very surprised by the quality of the sushi boat offerings.  The spicy white tuna tataki nigiri was reallly good. the mounds of scallions on top really hit it.  also good were the negihama maki and what I think was toro.  they definitely had some interesting rolls going around.  we ended up grabbing a salmon/crab/avocado/cream cheese roll at the very end bc we were still hungry.

The rolls we saw on the boats weren't on any menu that we received. Our service wasn't very good but wasn't horrible. It was just really awkward. The seafood salad contained a generous amount of fresh fish and was a pretty good deal for just under $20.

We eat here at least once a week, it's close to our house, the sushi is fresh, delicious and the staff is always friendly. I am slightly addicted to The Special Roll. The Special Roll is a shrimp tempura roll with avocado, a dollop of crab on top, sprinkled with sesame seeds and placed on top of a delicious spicy mayo sauce, so yummy I scrape up the remaining sauce with my chopsticks. We pretty much always grab the same things, Sake, Hamachi, Toro, Special Roll and Uni (when available) and leave full and happy. \n\nWe've noticed that when there's a wait, people are usually waiting to sit at the boat bar so we'll sometimes just choose to sit in the little room in back where the tables are.

You can grab whatever you want off the rotating boats or you can order your faves from the menu. \nMy faves: \nSpicy seared albacore - it does NOT get any better. The tuna is tender, seared perfectly and melts in your mouth. It is topped with a delicate sauce that doesn't take anything away from the tuna. It also has scallions and a tiny tomato on top! Pur-tay! \nSpicy scallops - served warm. Spicy California Roll. If you think you know Cali rolls, think again. They top theirs with spicy sauce and tera root fries. \nThe curry fish tempura roll is usually listed on the specials menu, but it seems to be available all the time.

Here I am making my way from the East Bay on my bike in 95 degree weather wearing my motorcycle jacket (because I'm such a responsible rider) I don't know if it was that or if it was really just that hot inside, but I was still sweating when I got there... gross. \n\nI don't think I have ever been to a sushi place that serves sushi on boats with FRESH fish. Usually everyone opts to not eat it or it's been sitting there going around in circles the whole night. Granted there were some of those dishes, but for the most part this is the freshest sushi boat place I actually have been to.  It was kind of rare to find a dish I wanted, but I managed. The only trouble was actually catching the dish as it flew by you at warp speed. Tracy actually tried to grab a dish only to have it snatched up by the party next to us... would have been nice if they gave it to her, but they didn't. I figure they didn't see her try and grab it, because they tried to get one for me later on during the meal.  Prices go according to the type of design on the plate. Basically you stack your plates and they tally them up at the end. Ten plates ended up costing me about $40, but I guess that is kind of normal for my sushi habits. I would suggest you get there early as later in the evening a line starts to form and you'll have to wait who knows how long.\n\ndrawbacks:\n\n- dragon roll had to much sauce beneath it... it was like sauce soup with a dragon roll.\n- had to wait awhile to get dishes you actually wanted\n- rather small place \n- what's the deal with a women's restroom and a unisex restroom? but no MENS restroom\n- boats blazing by before you could grab what you wanted\n\nthe good:\n\n- reasonably priced\n- servers walking around all the time and good with refills\n- fish fresh... not so bad\n- asparagus tempura roll was actually quite tasty", "author": "Steven T."}

It is pretty amazing that with the current economy we are so busy, and I am very thankful for it.  So, this one gentleman and I start talking about yelp, as it is the new \"thing\" I am \"into\".  Turns out he is a yelp reader, if not poster, and we exchanged a bit of knowledge on our favorite places in the area.  \n\nFunnily enough, one of the places he was raving about was Warakubune, a little sushi den that I could probably throw a stone at from where I work.   Lucky for them that I am not so violent.  Anyways, it has been on the list of someplace I need to go for a while now, but it just has never worked out, until tonight.\n\nAt about 4:30 my girlfriend comes to meet me before I close and is \"dying of hunger\", so I say... well I heard some good reviews about that place across the street that we have always wanted to try.  Coincidentally, she was craving Japanese, so off we go.\n\nThis is the second time I have been to a conveyor boat sushi spot, the other being in Japan town.  I found the fish here very fresh, and while some of the chef's were rather young, everything was delightful and delicious, including the service (less delicious, more delightful).  The fish was creamy and melted away in your mouth, without leaving a fishy aftertaste behind.

It was a great place for a party our size.  Comfortable, vaguely mood-lit, and not too loud.  Unfortunately, the service bordered on terrible.  We had to flag down a waiter to take our order, and when he brought us our food he couldn't figure out who had ordered what, and we were missing two plates at the end (which we eventually got when we pointed this out).  The sushi was actually quite good for a sushi boat place.  I had the tamago, the sake, an unagi hand roll, and a spicy tuna hand roll.  Rice was a teeny bit on the dry side, but the rest was great.  Shame on Warakubune, though, for that terrible ramen.  My friend made the mistake of ordering it, and me being the pig/ramen enthusiast I am, I had to steal some.  I realize Warakubune isn't a ramen house, and that even ramen houses get ramen wrong all the time, but please.  Get that abomination off the menu.  The broth was okay, though it tasted a bit more like chicken soup than miso, but the noodles were so thin and overcooked I'm surprised they didn't dissolve by the end of the meal!  My dear friend Shin and even Maruchan make a much tastier, chewier noodle.  Still, I had a good time here and the sushi was very good for the price.", "author": "Steph C."}

They were so adorable, and I'm so glad I checked them out! I think the boats were full perhaps 40% of the time, though it was a Saturday night, and that meant things were getting made fresh very often. The only problem I had was that there were several items in 5 categories, represented by 5 different patterned plates. So, if you are unfamiliar with sushi you might not know what's what, OR, realize you just grabbed a $5 plate when you might not have wanted to. I kept the menu near me to refer to but they kept taking it back and I had to keep asking for another one so I could try and guess what was on the little plates. This all might sound annoying, but I do love sushi so it was kind of a game grabbing things and I ended up trying a few new things and enjoying them. We had a good time!", "author": "S S."}

You start to get really picky and end up sticking to out of the way places that are mentioned in by people in the know. You drive out of town chasing the dragon of rumored broth greatness, special toppings or some other minute specialty. When my noodle partner said he noticed that Warakubune offered ramen, I balked at the idea. A sushi boat place in the middle of the parking hell that is Church and 16th? I had also long forgone my once in a while forays into the budget sushi places, instead saving up money for high quality, once in a while dinners.\nWarakubune is a very popular and it's not just the neighborhood that is bringing in the customers. We ordered 2 assorted sashimi platters (12 pieces ~$13), one assorted nigiri plater (10 pieces),  ~$12), 3 orders of uni nigiri that were on the specials board ($6 per order), tako sashimi, edamame, and some bowls of ramen. Most of the sashimi was decent, some pieces were a bit tough or fibrous, but not bad for the price. The biggest surprise was the uni, it was some of the best I've had in town. Creamy, silky, cold, and sweet. The nigiri were attractively presented but I didn't try any of them. Edamames were a tad over-cooked, so the beans were on the mushy/mealy side.\nAs for the ramen, I don't think I would go back for it. The broth was overly salty and lacked depth. I ordered tonkatsu ramen, but the broth that came out was a coffee hued beefy color unlike all other tonkatsu ramens I've sampled. The only toppings in the bowl were some spinach and 2 or 3 preserved bamboo shoots, but the set included a nicely panko crusted tonkatsu cutlet on the side. I haven't had very many bowls in SF that serve the pork fried and on the side and am more accustomed to bowls served with the standard set of toppings. Noodles were the right thickness but were already past al dente when the soup arrived. \nWe polished off 2 or 3 carafes of nigori (unfiltered cold sake) before we wised up and asked if we could buy the whole bottle (not mentioned on the menu). At $5 per carafe or $20 for the huge bottle, bottle is the way to go. Our waiter was nice enough to bring us a large metal bowl of ice to keep the monster bottle chilled throughout the meal. The hot sake was on the acerbic side (I'm not one for hot sake anyway), so I would stick with the cloudy sweet nigori.\nWe were in the small back room which is ideal for parties. The service was obviously busy with the crush of people waiting for a seat at the boat counter, but they were nice and did all that they could to accommodate our somewhat drunken party. Adjacent to the J-Church and a good value, I'll keep the W-bune in mind when I'm in the hood. Good times.", "author": "Candice L."}

The service is immediate, the sushi is top quality...the albacore literally dissolves as it touches your tongue. Known best for their Nigiri, they have recently added some tasty and funky rolls to the river; One, a California roll topped with Sriracha style spicy tuna and thinly sliced fried potato strings; the other, a shrimp tempura roll topped with avocado and sesame, swimming in a sea of spicy cream sauce. I rarely have to order anything from Benji, as the floating selection is always varied.", "author": "Nicholas M."}

It's not that it's the best sushi, it's mostly that the ambiance is down-home and comfortable, the food is always the same and basic (but good), the prices aren't overwhelming, and the group that runs this are super nice. Used to be my \"altnerate kitchen,\" it's now one of the key reasons I come back to this hood. Many people use this as their alternate kitchen, as well. My order: seaweed salad, a big beer, hamachi, their special fish (whatever that is), and usually someone gets a spider roll. Very yummy.", "author": "Anna B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-12", "description": "I live pretty close to this joint, so I frequent here at least once a week. I feel I know how to navigate these waters without a compass. All aboard, it's time to go angling on the S.S. Warakabune (Sushi-Boats).   \n      \n     First of all, climb aboard at your own risk. You could be moored down for quite some time if you arrive dockside, late, oh...say after 6:30PM. The trick is to get here as soon as they open (and preferably alone or as a pair) @ 5:30PM. This way you can take care of that \"uncontrollable urge\" (thanks DEVO) and catch a seat, port side. If you can do this, it's smooth sailing from here on out. If you can't make it here at the afore mentioned times then you are in for some rough seas. Gale force even. The only problem and it's a small one, is the seating hierarchy (or lack of). It's on a first come, first serve basis. And of course, everyone wants to be first. So keep your wits about you or you could drown in a sea of bodies. Another problem is that if you arrive with a large party, it's almost impossible to plot a proper course for your entire crew to dine at the trough. So, make a couple of them walk the plank, that way you can plunder the gully in a timely manner.\n     The catch is usually fresh, which is due to the fact that they tend to target certain species (Ahi, Hamachi, Sake etc.). No by-catch here...exotics (Kanpachi, Aji, Ankimo) tend to be tossed overboard or are harvested on the weekends (most times). Therefore, if you are the truly seaworthy type, come on the weekends to indulge in your epicurious cravings and do arrive early. Landlubber are ye? Than order from the galley, they have most of the cooked Japanese fare. \n   They have just recently swabbed the decks, the mess hall is brand spanking new. I like the new decor, it's a marriage of Tiki-hut chic and captains' trophy-room. \n\nAll in all, if you book your route accurately, it's a smooth cruise through tranquil waters.", "author": "Gabe T."}

I have lived in the Castro since 1987 and have been to at least 20 sushi restaurants in SF and many more outside of SF.  The key to great sushi is a selective chef who controls inventory so the food is as FRESH and SAFE as possible.  I am big into VALUE and this place wins hands down.\n\nOwner Ben and his wife Cynthia are super hospitable and reward regulars with little extras, e.g., if you order something like uni (sea urchin) and there is only enough for one piece instead of two, they make it and offer it free.  \n\nThe best uni is from Santa Barbara and often Ben will not order it if it is not available from there.  Lately he has had uni from Alaska and Japan so he must be happy with the quality coming in now.\n\nService is fast and friendly such as tea and water being refilled often and they hustle to bus bar seating to get the next person in line seated.  The staff is eager to take special orders if you don't see what you want.  Credit cards accepted, take out is fast, recent remodel is sophisticated for a neighborhood place.\n\nUnless you eat at many sushi places, it would be hard to compare this place.  The nigiri is larger than many places and the fish tastes more moist and succulent.  The rice is just the right amount of moisture and corrrect temperature to compliment the seafood.  They won't put oysters on the menu unless they are in the \"safe\" season.  The monkfish liver (Ankimo) is homemade and like butter!  I'm adventurous and enjoy Tobiko with Quail Egg, Ikura, Uni, Oysters ... and I've been HIV+ since 1988 with no problems from eating at this place since it opened.  \n\nSome sushi joints don't have liquor licenses ... Warakubune has wine, saki options and great beer selection ... all reasonably priced.\n\nYeah, no one ever wants to wait in this town of type A's.   But I like to see a family owned small business do well.  As it gets busier, I think of the how hard these folks work and wish them great success.  They are good people with class and a great work ethic.  That alone makes me want to support them.  But I can say that I have been to Blowfish, all the places in Japantown, Todai, Nikko Hotel, We Be Sushi, Godzilla, places on Clement, every place in the Castro, Ebisu, and more ... but if I had one last meal on this earth, I'd have the ambulance swing by Warakubune for take out!

This place is by my friends apartment, so I've been there a few times.  The first time we went, the boats were consistently awesome, especially some pieces of tuna sashimi in sesame sauce with chives.  It was the first time I ate sashimi and it was, if not life changing, then at least appetite changing.  I crave sashimi all the time now.  However, the second time we went the sushi was pretty so-so, not as much variety as the first time, so you had to wait a while for something appetizing to come around.  I had the tuna sashimi again in the end and it was just as good as before.", "author": "Emily G."}

The customer service is always friendly, but the lines are just ridiculous and that's really the only thing that prevents me from going sometimes. I like their blend of Chinese and Japanese flavors such the friend shrimp shu mai. You dip it in the hot mustard they serve it with- I love the combination of the tender shrimp and breaded crunchy crust. Also- the ginger Albacore specialty is one of my most favorite nigiri rolls i get there. It's topped with scallions and this spicy ginger sauce. The Albacore is soft, not slimy, and a hint of buttery ta ste. YUM! Last, the sesame seed super white tuna with cherry tomatoes is almost to die for. They have this spicy aioli sauce that accompanies it and it's just sooo goood! The prices are great and definitely not too expensive at all. We're talking 2-5 bucks a plate.  If you haven't tried it, try it.. just know it might take a little to get to the table.", "author": "michelle s."}

And while you are eating everyone is standing around and staring at you waiting for you to leave.  Its a very nervous experience.  That said the boat sushi is very fun and since there are so many people there all the time, its fresh and theres a great variety.  I love the small portions, so that even if youre a small party you get to have one of everything!  Avoid Friday night, or come when it first opens.  I love the \"Instant Gratification\" of it all...sit down and pop one in your mouth!  One to avoid:  The oysters, they leave something to be desired.

Went there this past saturday with this guy i have a huge crush on and had a great sushi experience.  I'm usually not into sushi but since then I'm craving it!  Had my first raw sushi and so did he, and it was pretty good.  the sushi boats are sOOo cute and i liked the fact that you can sit down and eat right away.  What made it fun too was that on each of our sides were two sushi-experienced couples that helped us in making good decisions.  the vibe was really friendly, and we all talked to each other. The service was good.  Everytime i take a sip of my tea and look away, I'd look back and my cup is filled to the brim.  nice swift work for the waitress ladies!  the guy making the sushi was quick and made any special orders promptly. OH and MY GOD the special rolls he made with the avocado and tempura were the BEST!!! my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  IT's 2 in the morning and I am feening for some right now!!! At the end of our date we had about well over 10 plates.  totaled almost to $40.00.  We had such a nice first time raw sushi experience together, that we bonded and the date lasted all night until the next morning..", "author": "ShayShay G."}

But during peak hours, the boats are frequently rotated and of course you can always ask the chefs/waiters for specific dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-09", "description": "I went to this sushi place by my house last night for a quick dinner. It's called Warakubune and is located on Church St. between 15th & 16th, across the street from \"secret sushi\". It has the moving sushi boats on a conveyer belt above the sushi bar. I know this can be a turn off for some people, but there's something very pleasing about having endless options of perfect sushi rolls and nigiri floating by. You have to react and hand select each dish. And the portions are smaller for the larger rolls (3 pieces), so you can sample more. You can also order off of their menu & order rolls/sashimi from the sushi chef that you don't see on the boats. Everything I tried was very good and the fish tasted incredible fresh. There are defintiely cheaper sushi spots in the neighborhood (secret sushi & Miyabi), but I really enjoyed my meal here. The service is impecible and fast and the atmosphere is fun. I'm not always into eating at the counter because you're shoulder to shoulder with your neighborhood (I know, that's SO American of me), but the food here is worth it. My friend and I ordered a large Sapporo and about 10 plates off of the boat. Our total was $38, which seems like a good price for what how much we ate and how high quality the food was.", "author": "Ariel D."}

In the following years, I have become obsessed with sushi, eating it wherever I can. And yet, I have NEVER had fish of such freshness and tenderness as at Warakubune - which I only learned the name of two weeks ago, having previously referred to it as \"sushi boat across from no name\". The waiter last night explained to me that the two favorite dishes there - the spicy white tuna (topped with green onion and ginger, resting delicately in a spicy creamy sauce) and the tuna tataki nigiri (topped with ginger/ garlic garnish) are exclusive to them. Which is why I will never stop going. Crafty, eh? And I have to disagree with Stellah D.'s opinion of the music. Last night they played only eighties hits from movies, so in addition to the best damn meal ever, we got to play 'Name that 80s Soundtrack Hit'.", "author": "Katy F."}
