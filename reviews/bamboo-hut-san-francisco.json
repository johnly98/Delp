So many good memories of post-work happy hours over flaming volcano bowls but it's still just as fun today. \n\nThe sand is now long gone but the good time remain. Pick a tiki drink from a pretty wide list. It's kitschy but a fun vibe. Get there early to get space in the cozy back area for larger groups. Spirited bartenders round out the experience. \n\nSF probably has the most tiki bars that I've ever seen in one city but Bamboo Hut is also like a neighborhood bar - albeit with lots of colorful tropical flair.", "author": "Jon L."}

This is not a good option for someone who likes to sit back with a glass of wine or quietly nurse a beer. This is a race to the finish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-09", "description": "This place is pretty ill yo! (ill = slag for cool) this is one of the few bars in North Beach that is trying to break away from the \"Buy one get one\" or \"Come here and get a super overly strong drink and puke everywhere\" vibe that a lot of bars in the North Beach area seem to have. This place is kinda..in a league of it's own so to speak. I'm talking about The Bamboo Hut. Let's get this review rollin!\n\nThe Bamboo Hut isn't a Dive Bar, it's not a Saloon or a Shishi Cosmo Lounge or anything like that. It's a festive, tropical almost like having a beer on a lounge chair in the sand next to the ocean kinda bar. As you enter, the decor would remind you of something that you may see on spring break with the possie. This place is really an indoor tiki lounge. Complete with a cabana, that's pretty dope if you ask me. The only thing missing is the hula girls and the fire dancers. This bar also has a huge Tiki head on the wall that will catch you off guard if you're the jumpy type. But its a cool add on to this bar. I hear they have a disk jockey on occasions and I think that's cool..me being one myself and all. I've been here a hand full of times and a great philosophy I've heard from someone is....\"If they can make your favorite drink correctly, then that's a place you need to frequent\" well in that case and amidst all their fancy and creative concoctions. \n\nThe Bamboo Hut will remain on my top 3 list of bars I go too when in in North Beach (check my sf check ins for my other hotspots) They have a beavy of specialty drinks here, to be honest....I have yet to try some of them. But I've indeed had drinks like the ones they have posted. Check out my picks for the selections and the pricing. I'm a Gin and Tonic dude, and here the bartenders make a pretty good one ($6). But the bartenders are a bit..dull and very detached..at least on some of my visits I've had here. But other than that, this place is a pretty cool place to check out and have a drink @. If you're brave go for the ($12) \"Volcano\" I've seen people order it, I haven't gotten that brave yet ha!\n\nIn closing, this place is very cool and different than any bar you will go to in the North Beach neighborhood. Its refreshing to see something different in a town full of Cosmo Lounges, Saloons, Dive Bars and Pubs. The environment is festive and fun. It sits off Broadway and Kerney street..kinda Monroe Night Club and Hue Nightclub is nearby. This place is very hip and trendy and I could imagine with the dj there it's crankin. My review is one of a few, if you're in North Beach and want to try somewhere new. Come here and as always, Yelp your own experience.", "author": "Tre S."}

There wasn't a lot of booth space since it was crowded of course but we ended up grabbing a booth. \n\nThis place gave out a great vibe. Me and my friends shared two volcanoes. Our first one was the pineapple one. It tasted okay. Kind of strong actually. But it went by fast with our group. The second on we tried the strawberry volcano. I personally think this tasted better than the pineapple but was wayyy to sweet. I was thinking to ask for a mixed flavor one because one was strong with alcohol and the other one was sweet. It would have made a great balance. lol \n\nThe volcanoes were $20 each. You can definitely share one with maybe 3-4 people. 5 people is pushing it. \n\nThe music playing was old school and I liked it.

It's a Tuesday so most people I know here can't meet up or hang out. After one friend does, but needs to jet early, he has \u00dcber cab drop me in North Beach for one last hurrah before I head back to my hotel. North Beach turns out to be full of strip clubs - I'm uninterested in that type of night - but a nearby dancer on the street is very helpful and sends me to Bamboo Hut. \n\nThe Beginning:\n\nI walk in and it's basically dead. However there is a super friendly, cool and chill bartender working. I sit down and I'm promptly served a potent cocktail and he easily engages in great conversation. He also so kindly allows me to charge my dying phone while I'm there. I had my hula hoop with me since I hooped in different areas all over SF during the day. Slowly people walk in and inquire about the pretty plastic circle I have with me. \n\nAs the night goes on, various dancers from the nearby slew of strip clubs come in and out either hunting for business or with their clients for the night to party. Everyone is very sweet...and plenty of drinks are served, all very potent...and now....\n\nThe Party:\n\nBasically, everyone is feeling it, in a good way. Stripper, client, guys night out, business men, then me...the only non dancer girl. We are dancing, singing, hula hooping (yes it ended up being the center of attention...show stealer...hmmmph) laughing, vibing, and just having a GREAT time. A fiery volcano is purchased for me, and while I couldn't finish most of it, it was quite the treat and like the other cocktails before it, potent! \n\nI partied like a brain damaged test monkey right up until close. Then the bartender and a local DJ ensured I was safe getting back to my hotel in Millbrae. \n\nBamboo Hut: It's cheap, it's dark, it's friendly, it's fun and the drinks are strong.

I couldn't ask for a better way to spend an evening.\n\nBamboo Hut started off what ended up being a very eventful Friday night. Just a small group of us left the office with the intention of doing a low key Chinatown/North Beach Bar Crawl - and if that's what your plan is, probably shouldn't start of the night with rum drinks. Lesson learned there, folks! \n\nBut I digress. We walked into to Bamboo Hut around 6 pm and it was relatively empty. Which I found surprising since the drinks here during happy hour are so cheap. Three of us split the giant volcano bowl and another two split the pina colada. Both were generous with the booze, yet didn't taste like rubbing alcohol. Maybe this is more of a late night spot?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-09", "description": "If you're looking for a tiki bar or a place that will serve all the fruity tropical drinks you desire, look no further.  \n\nIn my experience, it seems that the options in the city for the tiki bar atmosphere fall to Bamboo Hut, the Tonga Room, and Smuggler's Cove.  The Tonga Room is definitely suffering from price inflation, so reserve this place for rare occasions when you want the full experience of this slice of SF history.  I also struggle with categorizing Smuggler's Cove as a tiki bar, because I think of it more as a bar that specializes in rum-based cocktails (my favorites) and happens to have some decor resembling the tropics.  So in my mind, Bamboo Hut is the best bona fide tiki bar in the city.  But just because it won the title by process of elimination doesn't mean you're settling.  \n\nThere are a few booths, a semi-private room with bench seats and a long table (think coffee table rather than dining table), then of course the bar and standing room.  Apparently you can/should reserve the \"private\" area if you plan on bringing a large group during peak hours.  (I say \"private\" because there is no door closing it off from the rest of the bar, but you do have walls on 3 or the 4 sides so it is a little more isolated).\n\nWhile they can make you whatever tropical drink (blended or not) that your heart desires, you obviously cannot come here without opting for the volcano bowl.  Blended deliciousness (think daquiri meets pina colada) in a large specifically crafted ceramic bowl with room for lighter fluid (aka a very flammable liquor?) in the center to complete the full volcanic experience comes with many a long straw because you're going to want to share this bad boy.  \n\nThere's a \"Jukebox\" you can pay to play the song of your choice which works much better on a afternoon before the bar-hopping crowds arrive.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

They offer pineapple and strawberry, with the latter being my preference.\n\nAll was going well initially. We got there at 7 (even though their door says 8?), and there was seating everywhere. There was about 10 of us, so we grabbed the bench seating in the back.\n\nLoved the bowls, but I did not love the Bamboo Breeze cocktail. It was not at all what I expected. I'm not even sure if I got what was intended. I thought it would be blended, but it was essentially tequila on the rocks. No bueno. \n\nWhat would have been a 4 star experience became a 2 star experience when the bartender (who we had been generously tipping since the bowls were so cheap) came over after only a little over an hour to tell us a group called in and reserved the table we were sitting at, and that we had to move when they got there.\n\nWTF? The whole reason I had my group of friends get there at 7 was to guarantee we'd have a great spot for an evening of Tiki drinks. Why didn't he at least give us a heads when we sat down? Seems completely bogus to me.\n\nI have never heard of a bar doing this before, and I was and still am very skeptical. Maybe if their website had a speck of information on it, I could find out if he wasn't full of it. \n\nSo 9:40 hit, and some random dude came over cleaning up all of our glasses making it very obvious we couldn't sit there anymore. Rude.\n\nThe crowd also became very thuggish and douchey after 9:00 (yes, even for North Beach). Every one of my friends (and myself included) who used the restroom at one point were hassled in some way, either face-to-face or by people randomly banging on the bathroom door. Perhaps they needed to lay off the booger sugar. One-toilet bathrooms weren't designed for group activities!\n\nDue to this, I will not be returning to Bamboo Hut. It was all fine and dandy with the yelp prices and the early crowd, but after 9pm it was witching hour and the bar had completely changed its tune. No thanks.\n\nShould I even mention how juvenile the music was? I'm talking middle school dance.  Terrible.\n\nI'll be sticking to Smuggler's Cove, Tonga Room, and Trader Sam's.

Some you go to for the sheer perfection of their cocktail making like Smuggler's Cove ( I know it's more pirate ship but tiki bar but the drinks are the key ) Some however fall in a whole other category I'd like to call people watching.  At no other tiki bar in the bay area this is king more than at the Bamboo Hut.  First off the place doesn't have much to the design.  There's some of the typical kitschy tiki bar stuff but nothing to write home about.  The drinks are tasty and strong and probably the best value of the ones I've been to. The staff is friendly and quick. The patrons however...\n\nIt's a crap shoot every night.  It's that people watching game of craps that keeps me coming back for more.  I love the location in the heart of Broadway in North Beach.  It's always been a sanctuary for me when I duck and dodge all the people attempting to lure me into their strip joints as I walk down the main drag.  This sanctuary has always been the best value entertainment on Broadway as it is get this.... free entrance.  The bevy of personalities that have the potential of walking in is astounding. From short people with canes dressed in Smooth Criminal outfits to Russian Gangsters chatting with Peruvian surfers is just the tip of the iceberg when trying to describe who you might end up chatting with.  In many cases if you were to run into any of these people in the street you might find yourself trying to avoid them but at Bamboo Hut you are forced through the powers of alcohol and close proximation to each other to commiserate.  For some magical reason all the fears people have of stereotypes disappear when walking through the doors of the Bamboo Hut.\n\nSo my personal review is I love Bamboo Hut but it certainly isn't for everyone because it has such a unique feel to most other tiki bars.

My friends and I were awesome, though.\n\nService: Jesus, I asked for a dirty martini and she said, \"What's that?\" and then for a cosmopolitan and she said, \"I don't know how to make that.\" 'Nuff said.

I was barely drunk, so I'm convinced she was actually a goddess and wold look great if she was fully covered.  I need an in...\r\n\r\n\"What's with the costumes?  Is there a private party going on tonight?\"\r\n(Note:  NEVER say this to a stranger unless you are already sure they are in costume.)\r\n\"It's a birthday party... why are you not dressed as a pimp?\"\r\n\"I'm under cover.  Besides, pimpin is in the heart, not the clothes.\"\r\n\"Hahaha!  Do you guys know the birthday boy?\"\r\n\"No, where is...\"\r\n\"HEY!\" A shout from the back of the room.  Apparently, the goddess' boyfriend was unhappy with her talking with us.  She goes back there, and is scolded and sits down, completely dejected, next to this punk (who was, I suspect, invited, but failed to put his pimp gear on).\r\n\r\nI continue to chill, looking back at her every little while, knowing he was watching me watching her.  Finally, the fool goes to the restroom.  As soon as he rounds the corner, she jumps up and re-joins her friends.  Finally, though discreet trespass and almost imperceptible shifts in position, I find myself standing beside her once more.\r\n\r\n\"Jees.  Can you get rid of this guy (nodding towards the restroom)?  He's bringing me down.\"\r\n\"Sure.  Does he need cab fare.\"  In my mind I'm doing the calculation... Walnut Creek is far enough... about $100 away.  She laughs and is about to respond, but he returns from the restroom (you KNOW a guy like that doesn't wash his hands) so they again retire to the back of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Dude\" I say to my friend, \"we need to take that guy out.\"\r\n\"I'm with you, but he's pretty big.\"\r\n\"No problem, I'll just hit him with this beer bottle.\"\r\nHe looks closely at our soon-to-be victim...\r\n\"He's got a varsity wrestling jacket on... it might take two.\"\r\n\"How about this fire extinguisher?\"\r\nAs I'm looking at the locking mechanism, trying to discover how to get it off the wall, they leave.  Ah well, it would have been pretty messy in here.  Kinda like fighting King Kong:  Hit him with the extinguisher, grab his girl and run like hell.\r\n\r\nOnce they left, I was able to see that a really great party was talking place all around me.  The perfect 10 was gone, but a room full of 9s ain't bad.\r\nMy buddy latches onto a fine girl in a nano-mini.  They start getting close and I see her whisper into his ear.  He says something back and she gets even closer.  Nice work, my man!  Later, he comes by and tells me about the conversation:\r\n\"I have something to tell you, but I don't know how\"\r\n\"It's cool, just go ahead an say it\"\r\n\"Well, it's just that I'm... I mean I like.... I'm a lesbian.\"\r\n\"Hmmm.  That's cool.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this knowledge did not slow him down for a minute turned her on even more.  Every time I looked over, his hands were places polite society will not let me mention in this post.\r\n\r\nOh yeah... this is supposed to be a review of the bar.  Good service, friendly staff.

That's probably because I'm so charming, but I would guess at least some of you are also.\n\nSeriously though, as a jumping off point for a group friends hitting the town hard, flaming booze in the back room is hard to beat.

A selection of premium and cheap beers. Ask jay for an SOB. mellow environment. A colorful cast of characters who I assume are the regulars. Like a loud and large man that the others refer to as \"fat Sam\"... But my favorite part time and time again is the music. Usually the bar tenders Mario, jay, Jamie, rocko and Stephanie play from their Ipods...and they truly have great taste. but from time to time they have killer DJs like Aspect from the jazz mafia...saw him there on a Saturday night. There is a couple, a guy and girl (btw chick is a serious hottie) they play oldies on Monday so if you wanna dance to 50s and 60s rock and roll you gotta check them out. its a great low brow place. Won't make you wait long for an elaborate tiki drink and then charge you an arm and a leg. Plus fellas if you're on Broadway looking at the ladies this is the ONLY REGULAR BARon Broadway...and if you're lucky you won't have to pay any women you meet there to touch you...also if you wanna strike up a convo with one of the Broadway bimbos you see in the clubs they take their breaks here.\n\nAll in all this place is a hoot so check it out next time your in north beach.", "author": "Steuart L."}

Have you ever thought about where to go before hitting the club so you will have a REALLY good time. Well this is the place to go before hitting any of the clubs along the red light district. The scorpion bowls are great for groups and will really get you going. The place isn't big but its good enough for small groups. The people here are very lively and have such a good time. They end up dancing and doing weird things since they don't realize how strong these drinks can be. Just a note don't try drinking a whole scorpion bowl by yourself.

There is more indie/punk/upcoming bands played.. which I love to listen too.\n\nI went down a couple times last week.  And on Wednesday, they had a band playing and Mondays are 'drunken fiesta' with nachos and beer specials. fantastic for getting through the work week.\n\nAlright, and that's about all I've got to say about this bar.

Our DJ of the night, aside from ignoring requests, played fairly decent music.  The floor was like a giant sand box and they gave us free flip-flops, which made for some interesting times.  A few volcano bowls later we danced across the sand and made our grand exit.\n\nIt all worked out in the end: recalling the carnal look of the bartender as he objectified my friend was just what I needed to enduce the at home vomiting spree that saved me from what could have been a hangover most murderous!\n\nNext time though, I think I'll stick to Trader Sams for my tiki bar bowl of ice blended booze needs.", "author": "Christophe B."}

There are two booths in the whole place and a lot of standing room. The DJ is right on the floor in a little cubby hole playing music out of speakers that you stand right next to. You also have to pay a five dollar cover charge...I didnt really like the place. The only good thing about Bamboo Hut is that the drinks were strong and we got one for free.
