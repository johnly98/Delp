Sanppo was always in the corner of my eye never eliciting much excitement as I presumed it was one of those old-timey J-town eateries that caters to the most undiscriminating tourists. I'm not sure what motivated Jamie W. and me to try it after all these years, but we had a weak moment when nothing else was really striking a chord with us. Besides, Jamie wanted some katsu curry.\n\nWe entered, and as expected, the tables looked clumped together haphazardly, and the furniture looked rather worn. But it was pretty crowded with what appeared to be regular customers who appear quite devoted to the relatively reasonable prices to be found here. We started with a $5.50 order of Gyoza, a half-dozen pan-fried which was exactly what we wanted (photo: http://bit.ly/1o3ypOa). True to his word, Jamie ordered the $13.95 Tonkatsu Beef Curry which came with the curry sauce almost overflowing from the dinner plate (photo: http://bit.ly/22tfsHz).\n\nIt was decent enough though too watery for my taste. My mom would have rolled her eyes if she had lids. It came with a bowl of iceberg lettuce salad with miso dressing and another bowl of miso soup (photo: http://bit.ly/1VysZZg). Standard stuff really, but they hit the spot. I actually had better luck with the $16.95 Nasu Hasami Yaki, which combined a good amount of grilled beef strips with fried eggplant (photo: http://bit.ly/1pZcjxX). It was a carnivorous blend that worked for me with rice, soy sauce and a side seaweed salad. I also got the same salad/soup combo to start.\n\nYou would think that was enough, but no, we also split a $6.95 order of the Hamaichi Negi Maki which was definitely on the meh side as we weren't tasting a great deal of freshness from the sea (photo: http://bit.ly/1T4RyMJ). All in all, we were not overly disappointed by our experience here. If you want decent enough Japanese food that's a couple of cuts above Tokyo Express, then Sanppo works in a pinch. Jamie and I actually came back a month later though that had more to do with Jamie liking the familiar when he goes out to eat.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty predictable dishes served here, some good, some not as much\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...tired-looking is the most charitable thing to say\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...speedy if somewhat brusque at times\nTOTAL - 3 stars...not as bad as you would expect but no omakase here", "author": "Ed U."}

We went in at 2PM and the restaurant was busy but there were at least 3 servers and they were making things move. I ordered beef with curry. When it arrived it had a generous portion of beef, curry and white steamed rice. I attacked the dish but I quickly sensed that one side of is was barely warm so I asked our waitress to warm it up. She took it back but did not attempt to apologize. When the dish came back I could see steam which was a good sign. The beef with curry was good. The only problem was that the curry was probably medium spicy which is too spicy and it sort of ruins the flavor of the dish because it's too potent. It is not just potent but pungent and I don't like that. I can tolerate mild spicy food after eating more and more over the years but when it comes to the point it gets annoying, eating is no more fun. My friend ordered a vegetarian roll. When he ordered a second and I politely asked if it was an appetizer or a main course our waitress started to get defensive and gave me an attitude by saying \"it can be anything you want\". I would have given 3.5 stars to the business but since they did not heat the food and the waitress was giving me an attitude I can only give 2 stars. On the other hand, the older Korean lady is very polite and she is very good at giving directions to customers when they arrive to speed up the process of attending people.", "author": "X. Y."}

The service is poor. the tiny restaurant was busy, but we were able to find a table for 5 of us just fine. our server came to us after about 10 minutes, and ordered water, as we looked at the menu. she didn't return for a good 20 minutes and left half way through our sushi order. she said to \"push the button\" if we needed her....which we did many times, yet we rarely saw her.\n\n2. Food is amazing and fresh. we ordered a handful of different rolls to share amongst us and it was delicious. spicy tuna, avacado, veggie, unagi and more fill our plates and our bellies. SO GOOD.\n\n3. Prices are pretty decent. the ones we ordered were much cheaper than their fancy rolls, yet just as good. they do offer bento boxes and full meals as well, for a good price too. only downside? NO HAPPY HOUR. sad day.\n\n4. It's located right in the heart of Japantown and walking distance from our house! \n\nOverall - this place was decent. i wouldn't return if i'm ever back in the city, but it was a great introduction to the cities selection of fresh fish :)", "author": "Katie F."}

Meanwhile, other tables were served their food. The servers tried to make up for it by bringing us seaweed salad and miso soup on on the house.

Empty tables still stacked with dishes for some time after guests left.\n*No one serving or preparing food was wearing gloves. Our server handed my soup out with her thumb in the dam.. Bowl. My friend's sushi tray looked slick. She did not finish her food, she said it tasted bland and gave her a stomach ache halfway through. My soup tasted like tepid eye drops. Our place settings were \"recycled\" but not in a good way.\n*No visible health department badge or business license.\n*Our server was kinda confrontational; had an attitude the entire time she waited our table.

I've been here a few times before and never had any complaints. It wasn't that crowded for a Saturday night with about 4 other families and the environment wasn't noisy like sometimes restaurants can be.\n\nI ordered a Dinner Box which is a three combination bento box with Saba (Mackerel), Ton Katsu, and Chicken Terriyaki all for about $10 plus of course tax and tip.. but that's pretty affordable! The portions were very satisfying and maybe it's because I ate a little before but my family gobbled up all of theirs. The TonKatsu was a little too fried for me but it wasn't like there was a lot of batter, which was good. Of course the bento box included miso soup, salad, and rice.\n\nJust a cute thing: I went to the restroom and there was a small stack of mini Korean paperback comic books for your enjoyment during your trip to the restroom... sweeeet.", "author": "Lauren K."}

This is your average mediocre sushi joint, and I expected a bit higher quality from a Japantown establishment. Nonetheless, it got the job done.\n\nIn the middle of lunch time on a Saturday, our group of 10+ was quickly accommodated and served. Hot sake flasks came out one by one followed with ice cold Sapporo. Even though we were a large group, the service here is efficient and without hassle, contrary to many other reviews.\n\nI ordered a Donburi Special I, which was chicken teriyaki over rice and assorted tempura. Mediocre at best. The chicken was very plain and just had a bit of teriyaki sauce drizzled over it. The portion was a lot less than I expected and would've filled up maybe half of a standard donburi bowl. Tempura was pretty standard as well. Nothing to rave about.\n\nI'm sure there are much better places in J-Town. This works for a large group, but food quality is just so-so.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-21", "description": "We were skeptical that this restaurant on the main road (Post St.) would be any good.  It looked like a tourist trap from the outside with the sign board on the sidewalk advertising some of the types of food on offer.  It was great that they posted their full menu in a showcase so we knew exactly what they served.  We just wanted bento box lunch combination meals, and if that were so then one of the items we look for is the saba shioyaki.  Thus, Sanppo Restaurant fulfilled our wishes.\n\nNow looking through the entrance door we spotted a few tables that were full.  So we decided to take a chance and try a different Japantown restaurant.  We were given menus when seated, however, it was not until we ordered our food that we were asked what we would like to drink.  Tea and water need to be requested; they are not given upon being seated.  Note:  We were never offered refills.  I assume one needs to request them...\n\nThe food was fairly priced, and there were three types of bento box lunches to choose from.  I was disappointed in the tempura as they only give one prawn; every other Japanese restaurant offers two prawns.  The rest of the tempura was just eggplant (tiny piece), carrot, and yam.  The teriyaki beef that came with it was all right albeit on the rare side.  My dining partner had the saba, salmon, and sashimi combination which were all reportedly very good.  We also ordered an Ichiban roll which was good.\n\nService was efficient, and our server was polite.  However, as mentioned already she did not freely give any refills of water and tea. One probably needs to request it.\n\nAnother point to note is that they have clean enough toilets and even better no sharing with another restaurant.  This was welcome after having to deal with the situation when dining at Kushi Tsuru.", "author": "Luisa T."}

Best word to describe the food was....meh. It didn't really impress, but it didn't stand out in a bad way either. I thought the prices were a bit high for the quantity and quality of the food they served; most dishes they served for dinner was at or above 10 dollars, even the bento special (two dishes with miso soup, salad, and rice) at $9.95. I ordered the bento special, pork Gyoza and the grilled salmon roll, and the first thought that came to mind when my order came was how small the portions were. There were maybe 5 rolls of the grilled salmon that just seemed like mashed up fish from a can and only four bitesize pieces of Gyoza, which me and my boyfriend finished in less than a minute. By the end of the meal, I was still hungry and resorted to drinking the free water to fill me up. \n\nI would have to say that the service was pretty good though; the servers were prompt with anything we told them to do, and since I came with group of 13, they split checks for each of us.

Please do not come to this restaurant even if you are really starving for food (as we did) because it will just make you wish you hadn't eaten the food at all.\n\nFirst of all, the service was extremely slow. For some reason, when I was trying to order something, the waiter kept insisting that it was something else. Then he cut me off after I repeated my order like three more times and not understanding it, and saying he has to go take care of other customers. I can read, and i know what i'm ordering. Besides, what kind of waiter just runs off saying he needs to go help other customers when there's one he hasn't taken care of right in front of him??\n\nThe food took a long time to come. I ordered udon, and the noodle is mushy. The soup is bland and the fried tofu was just ugh. My friend ordered katsu and it was soooo dry. \n\nWhen the bill came, i found that what i ordered and what they put on the bill are DIFFERENT items, it has extra charge. I went to the waiter asking him to correct it, but instead i accidentally invited this other waitress there into this conversation. The waiter and waitress started having their conversation in Korean and i was left standing there. \n\nWITHOUT having actually served my food, she told me that the amount is correct and I needed to pay for it. Well of course, I have already finished my food, so there is no argument for me there. To avoid wasting my time further I paid without giving them tips because honestly, they were rude (the waiter never spoke to me in a friendly tone), and now after reading some reviews about how some customers were charged a tip WITHOUT notifying them and also having multiple charges of the same item on their credit cards makes me a little nervous about what they will do to my final amount. \n\nAnyways, sorry about the length. I really just needed to get this out of my head because I have never encountered a restaurant as horrible as this one. Go in at your own risk, but I would definitely not be going back there unless I need to yell at them for charging me things that I did not write on the receipt and tips they don't deserve.", "author": "Y L."}

I love Japanese food, but have grown tired of the same places I frequent in Japantown. While there for SF Comic Con, my husband, my niece, and I decided to try this place out. Mind you my niece had never been to J-Town so this was her first experience having food there. I really loved the atmosphere as it felt like a hole in the wall ramen house in Japan. The food was reasonably priced and the food was pretty good for the most part. So why the low rating? The service. Let me tell you what happened. After we were initially seated, the woman who was our server brought us water and took our orders. She corrected our pronunciation of the food, which typically wouldn't have bothered me because I know I can't pronounce Japanese words very well, however she was condescending and very rude about it. For about 15-20 minutes after that we waited for our food, drinking our water. All three of us drank the last of our water and were never once offered a refill. We had to flag down the waitress and tell her we wanted more water. She groaned and, we believe, rolled her eyes at us. After we got our water, we ate and finished our food. We all drank through our water again and were not offered refills again. We decided not to ask again out of frustration so we were sucking on the ice. After we got the check we paid cash. We weren't demanding, sure we asked for more water, but that was it. We said \"please\" and \"thank you\" and barely got a nod out of her. Because of all of this and the general attitude toward us we decided to let the tip reflect the service.  $2, but we still tipped.  Now mind you, I've left very generous tips for decent and good service, but this was bordering on insulting. As we prepared to leave and are standing to go, the server walks over, picks up the tip, slams it down, and says \"That's only 1%, you need to leave more!\" First, it surely was not 1%, it was indeed more since our bill wasn't $200. The spectacle she made and the rude, flat out insulting way we were treated convinced me I will never ever return to this establishment. If this restaurant wants to employ someone that treats their customers like this, I refuse to be subjected to it again. I've had excellent world class service at other restaurants in J-Town, and this was certainly not the case here. We were very disappointed, embarrassed, and overall disgusted by how we were treated. I rarely hope or recommend that a company fire an employee, but I may make an exception here.", "author": "Justin H."}

I don't know what's up with all the horrible reviews, it was pretty good to me. I got a Chirashi which I get at every new sushi joint. It was presented nicely and had the most common sashimi: maguro, sake, shiro maguro, hamachi, unagi, and tamago. No tako, sad face. The fish quality was really great, cut rougher like I had in Japan. Maybe according to bay standards this is low, but in Sac it would be top 3 if not best! Delicious. \n\nNow the sushi rice and tamago are a whole different story. The tamago was hard to eat, I hated the ice cold liquid in between the folds and the graininess of it. Disgusting, it came with two but I could only eat one and painfully according to my friend. I get that like every place is frozen because it's difficult to make but the ones at my jobs are good so try a different brand. The rice was hard and chewy and flavorless. Not sticky and couldn't taste the seasoning. I didn't take the rest to go and I almost never waste so I recommend a change in recipe, it's not that hard. \n\nThe service was really nice, the restaurant was nice to sit in and pretty decent prices.

If you were wondering, it is run by Koreans.", "author": "Nancy M."}

The teriyaki salmon was soooo delicious and tender.  However, my piece of salmon wasn't even half of the size of my friend's piece of salmon.\n-2. The saba (mackerel) I got was super dry and shriveled up...but I managed to scrape the middle portion of it to salvage and eat up.\n-3. the california roll is great...but how can you ever go wrong with that?\n\nVegetable tempura lunch item:\n-yummy!! They give you lots of tempura plus you get miso soup, salad, and rice with it.\n\nOverall, this place was ehh and the server wasn't very friendly and didn't really talk to us or attempt to make any sort of friendly conversation with any of us.

Sanppo just didn't cut it.\n\nMy dad and I had just come from a Giants game craving some late night noodles...being 10:30 PM we decided to go to Sanppo.

Now as a test, I started the stopwatch on my phone. In my opinion, the amount of time that it takes to get the bowl of noodles to the table should reflect upon the quality that you get. Longer time = Better quality. \n\nEight minutes and thirteen seconds later, (an alright time...considering we were the only ones there), we had our bowls sitting in front of us. To be honest, the noodles tasted like instant ramen (mushy and swolen) while I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the broth...something just did not taste right.\n\nSitting there, we figured out that the waitresses were Korean and the chef was Hispanic. So either our food was either just plain bad...or a crappy interpretation of Japanese cuisine...\n\nWhat else...we had to ask twice for water...which shouldn't have to happen when you are the only patrons in the restaurant.

Surprised it was not packed as the other places on a Friday night. Perhaps that was a sign for things to come, but I like to give things the benefit of the doubt. It was nice that they had the menu posted right outside the restaurant. I was always embarassed to go inside ask for a menu, take a look at it and walk out. So this saves face for both the diner and the dinee. \n\nThe thing that really sealed the deal was the dinner special. It was pick any 3 items for $9.50. The choices included, chicken, beef, tonkatsu, salmon, california roll, and a few other selections. I was like whoa, for a Japanese restaurant in SF, in Japan town, at dinner time, that was surely a great price.\n\nSo as we enter, I was surprised to not be greeted by the usual greeter. You actually have to walk a few feet down until and we were finally greeted. I was not sure if we just helped yourself to a seat or what, so it was a bit uneasy just wandering on in.\n\nSo I order my dinner special, and picked the california roll, beef and chicken terrayaki. Mind you this also comes with miso soup, salad, and rice. \n\nThe miso soup was ok. When I say ok, I mean it's just like all the other places that serve miso soup on the side. My girl got the Nabeyaki Udon. It actually came before my entree. It was served in a cool looking pot with a handle. So good job with the presentation. I actually had some of it and it was good.\n\nSo my food arrives, and I was expecting very small portions, but they were actually decent. It came with 3 (or was it 4) pieces of california roll. The beef and chicken was of a decent portion. The rice was good, no complaints here, and more than enough if I had gotten another choice that required eating with rice instead of the california roll. The chicken was good, and on par with places that cost much more than this place. The beef was alright. I've had better. It didn't seem as fresh as the chicken, and even the sauce could not cover that up. It was passable though. The california rolls were gooood.

The sashimi combination overall was pretty bad, tastes not fresh (with the very small possible exception of the hamachi).  The spicy hamachi roll I didn't care for (for one thing, it was done futomaki-style which is not my preference).  The one thing that secured them a one-star rating was the service.  The lady server looked bored standing around most of the evening.  Then, halfway thru dinner I wanted a refill of water.  The few times that girl walked by I'm sure she noticed my glass was empty.  She made no offer or gestures towards refilling the glass.  She only refilled it when I asked for it when she brought the check, and even then she gave a disinterested response.

Lunch time with a party of 4 of us and decided to give this business a chance.  Ordered sake, a couple of rolls and four udon noodles.  There are plenty of other restaurants in japantown that will give you a better order of curry udon noodles for less than the 12.95, but nevertheless, that was what was ordered.   When the bill comes, as with a lot of typical Asians with close friends, we fight to grab the check.  Without bothering to look at the itemized bill, we pay with a credit card on the bottom number.  It seemed a bit pricey, but we add the tip in on top of the balance.  The waitress takes the charge slip and bill away and does not leave a copy with us.  Did not think anything of it and sat around for a few more minutes before leaving.  As we get ready to leave,  I requested a copy of the credit card receipt and check for my records and leave.  After getting a moment to finally look at the receipt, it turns out that the waitress added in a gratuity amount of 18% to our bill without saying anything about it.  It turns out that on top of the tip already included, she knew that I had put an additional amount of 18% and took the receipt away with the full knowledge of being tipped twice.   What kind of scam are they running?  \n\nWith this type of conduct in a tight economy, they would risk losing customers on marginal food?\n\n\nThere are many excellent restaurants in this area that have far better food and practices.", "author": "Peter L."}

They don't get 5 stars because they aren't too well equipped to handle a lot of people, so when it's busy, their service suffers. But good food, good prices and an enviable location make this place a must.", "author": "Klik W."}

We've never been disappointed when my boyfriend and I come here.\nI guess maybe it *is* American-style Japanese but it's clean and cozy and reasonable - oh, and it's one of the only restaurants open after 10pm you can eat at without feeling greasy and stuffed afterwards!

Perhaps it's because I've been such a frequent patron in the past that I get free wakame salad (which is really good here...the perfect amount of seasame oil balances the interesting texture of the seaweed). Or that the servers are ALWAYS nice (but that depends on how you treat them). Or maybe it's because no matter what I get, it's all pretty damn good. The caterpillar roll is good and quite reasonable. So is the 49er roll. Their sashimi and nigiri showcase their fish quality. At lunch, you can get their sushi special for about $14, which includes a roll and then 5-6 pieces of nigiri. The kitsune udon is very good, as well. They're open pretty late....later than almost everything at the Japan Center (which I don't find particularly fantastic and more expensive, too).

Some 20 years ago, this place was one of my favorites.  The name of the restaurant used to be Tampopo back then.  I recently had a chance to have a lunch there again.  It was very disappointing.  I ordered a bowl of ramen and it was the worst ramen I ever had in my life.  When it comes to ramen, there are two things that are important: broth and noodle.  The texture of noodle was so so.  The broth was supposed to be boiled for a long time with mixture of meat and vegetables to add delicacies and rich flavor and then added flavor such as miso, soy sauce, or some other spices.  It didn't taste anything like that.  The broth was nothing but salty and dull miso taste.  I just don't know how to describe the taste otherwise.  The size of the meal was not big enough either.  I hate to say bad things about hard working people's work, but the ramen at this place was just unacceptable.

I went there with a group of friends. As soon as I walk into a sushi restaurant I can sense if something doesn't seem quite right. Then you place your order and the wait person doesn't understand the items you are ordering, or can't answer simple questions like \"do you have pickled plum roll?\" which is a basic item in any sushi place.\nMy sister ordered \"tsukimi\" udon. It is a udon noodle dish which has an egg on top, and the yolk looks like the moon. Thus the name \"tsukimi\" which means \"moon watching\". The food takes long time to come out...everybody else is almost done eating while my sister patiently waits for her noodle dish. It finally comes, and it has no egg on top. She tells the server the egg is missing. She answers that it does not come with it. My sister insists that there should be an egg on it. Then waitress goes back in the kitchen, and come back another 5 minutes later with the noodles with an egg on top. No apologies or anything.\nMy dish, which was grilled mackerel, was not very good. It is a tasty fish on its own, so I suspect they do not use quality fish. Then they overcooked it. \nThis is a place to avoid, like so many other unauthentic Japanese restaurants.", "author": "M K."}

Upon entering the establishment, there were people waiting, so I went to the cashier area to ask how long the wait would be, but the waitress did not hear me, so I had to repeat the question four times before I got an answer.  During that time, she ask my name three times and I told her three times what it was, but she still did not answer the initial question, \"how long is the wait for two people?\"  After I got an answer, she walked away and I had to come back again to the stand to ask to have my name be put on the waiting list.  When we finally got a table, the table next to us cleared and another group came.  The table was set for three, but the party had four people, so they made the guy stand at the table for more than ten minutes before they finally got him a seat.  After the guy got his seat, we got our tea, ten to twenty minutes.  The appetizers came, however, we didn't get all of them.  Then the sushi came, but it was the wrong items.  We told the waitress that it was the wrong item, and she had the nerve to tell us that we ordered a spicy salmon roll instead of the spicy tuna.  I told her that she must have heard me wrong, but she said that was what I ordered.  We also told her that we were missing an appetizer, she looked at us blankly and said yes, it was coming.  It was another thirty minutes or so before we realized that one of the items ordered had not come out yet.  After twenty more minutes, we just wanted to get out of there and ask them to cancel the order.  They refused.  It was just an aweful experience overall.

For entrees we split the Oyster Nabe which was chock full of plump juicy oysters and napa cabbage in a lovely clean broth with clear yam noodles and a plate of tuna and salmon sashimi.  The oyster nabe was a revelation, hearty and flavorful, without being heavy.  And the sashimi fish was pretty decent, not fishy, and very soft to mouth, although not exactly delicately cut.  With a nice, dry chilled sake, that tasted delicately and cleanly of melons, we had a very satisfying and healthy meal.", "author": "Tara W."}
