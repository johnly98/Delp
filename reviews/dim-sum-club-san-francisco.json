IMO it's more authentic than any other spot in Chinatown, and more convenient than venturing out into Richmond/Sunset (for downtown SF folks like me). This place is so low-key that, despite having lived in the city for several years, this past weekend was my first time hearing about it. \n\nMy friend and I came here at 12:30pm on a Sunday, and we were seated within 15 minutes. There was a small crowd when we arrived, but the line moved fast. \n\nMy favorite items that we ordered: \n\n1. Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (cha siu bao) - 5/5\nWow, we were *muy* impressed. Fresh pork and the perfect pork-to-sauce-to-bun ratio, nestled in a soft, fluffy bun. \n\n2. BBQ Pork Noodle Roll (cheong fun) - 5/5\nThe skin was *on point* (the make-it-or-break-it factor for cheong fun). I've had so many \"soggy\" cheong fun experiences in the city that I was convinced I'd have to go back to HK for legit cheong fun. Happy to say that Dim Sum Club's cheong fun is legit!\n\n3. Pan Fried Turnip Cake (loh bat go) - 5/5\nPerfectly pan-fried with a crispy top layer, and not at all greasy!\n\n4. Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai - 5/5\nA HK girl knows a good siu mai when she has one (:\n\nWe also ordered the Preserved Egg w/ Pork Porridge (comes with a side of Chinese fried donut) and Stuffed Eggplant w/ Black Bean Sauce, but those were meh. I'd recommend saving your tummy for their other items.\n\nAll in all, I was very impressed with Dim Sum Club and highly recommend all you dim sum lovers give it a try!", "author": "Cindy L."}

The server was quick to set our table, we passed on the tea due to an upcharge (seems to be a thing in SF).  The older gentleman watching over everything was super nice and came over to us to chat for a bit at the end of the meal.  \n\nI loved their take on the shrimp & chive dumpling, you can see it from my pictures....they were more like globs and not closed off on top but super yummy.  The scallion pancakes were a bit too thin and fell a part in your hand.  The salt & pepper tofu was anything but and probably the biggest disappointment overall, not what I was expecting and practically flavorless.  The chicken feet were some of the biggest and meatiest I've ever had, the star of the show here....if I could get those shipped back home 3000 miles I totally would do it.    \n\nThe prices keep it from being a full five stars, we stuck to the cheaper options and still had a bill over $40 for what didn't seem like a lot of dishes.  At least all of the prices are posted on the menu, many dim sum places don't do that for you.  If you live in the area, this will definitely do the trick to get your Chinese brunch fix in.", "author": "Jeff M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-25", "description": "The food here has gone downhill since the last few times dining here. The Shanghai dumplings were way undercooked (pink pork meat) and the outside was gummy and like clay in my mouth. The vegetable gyoza/pot stickers were also gummy and very underdone, and the insides flavorless and a mix of random sodden vegetables that didn't pair well. The pork puffs had an incredibly fishy smell and taste to them inside and out, perhaps they were fried in the same oil as a seafood item. Many items we ordered this round were definitely inedible and we left much of it behind because we couldn't eat them nor were we at all interested in taking them home to-go. \n\nService was touch and go. No air conditioning so the heat from the kitchen really fills the venue and makes it stuffy and uncomfortable. Floors were questionably clean. I'm sad that this was once featured in SF's Weekly Yelp and now it's really taken a nosedive.", "author": "Alison A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-02", "description": "Dim Sum Club has consistently gotten better over the past two years. Yup, five star worthy now. It used to be a little too oily (many of the dishes) but I feel like they took note and listened to customers - or got a new chef. Our last visit, we were so impressed with every single dish. What stood out: salt and pepper chicken wings (perfection) shanghai dumplings (perfect), pork chow mein (epic!) and onion pancakes (heaven!). I also like that they're friendly. Most dim sum experiences are impersonal - you order and there is no interaction with your server. Here they actually check in on you and ask you how you like everything. A little goes a long way. Yes, a Cow Hollow motel is a random location for dim sum, but heck, it works. And it's worth trekking to the area for if you are on a dim sum kick.", "author": "Meredith R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-11", "description": "One of my favorite Chinese spots in SF, right on Van Ness. Don't judge it for being part of a motel! The food is pretty darn good. Parking can be an issue with being right on Van Ness, especially with all that construction going on with the lanes. We try to park a couple of blocks away and walk over. \n\nFood: They have congee! I ordered the pork and century egg congee, with ginger and scallion. Good sized portion (enough for two to share, or just be one hungry congee eater like me), and was served with the traditional side of deep fried dough cut into strips. I rather mine be whole, but it was fine. We also ordered the har gao (shrimp dumpling), and siu mai (shrimp + pork). Both delicious and fresh. The orange chicken was perfectly cooked, with a nice coating of sauce that wasn't overly sweet. The salt and pepper pork really should come in a entree size. Crisp and delectable. \n\nService: The food does not all come out at one time. As with many Asian restaurants, dishes come out as they are cooked, and we're used to that. That does mean food is cooked to order, and everything was hot and fresh. Water glasses were kept filled, and we gave them a wave when the teapot needed refilling, but that was done quickly. \n\nCost: We had SO much food. We clearly ordered too much. It was about $70 after tax and tip. And for 3 people with the amount of food we had, that was pretty decent.\n\nOverall: Give it a try. Food is good, and the ambience was decent. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but if you're up for walking a couple of blocks, you'll be fine.", "author": "Shirley B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-03", "description": "This restaurant seems to be geared toward non-Asians (probably because of the location), and because of that, prices are really high compared to other dim sum places. Siu mai for $6.25, are you forreal?! That better be the best darn siu mai I've ever had (spoiler alert - it's not). \n\nBuddha vegetarian noodle roll ($6.50) - full of veggies, including bamboo, carrots, and fungus. Noodle was thin and soft as it should be, while still being able to hold the contents of the roll without breaking apart. \nChinese donut w/ noodle roll ($5.50) - came out looking a bit messy and deflated. The Chinese donut didn't taste like it had just come out, and so the whole thing was just kind of chewy. Didn't include sesame paste or sweet sauce, boo.\nPork & shrimp siu mai ($6.25) - looked good, decent size, juicy and tasted good too. But not so special that I can't get it elsewhere for a couple dollars cheaper. \nSteamed homemade dumpling ($5.50) - not personally a fan of this anywhere, but parents said it was good\nPan fried turnip cake ($5.00) - this was the best dish of the meal. Delicious and pan-fried beautifully with that nice crispy top!\nPan fried bean curd skin roll w/ shrimp ($6.75) - this was also fried very nicely so the bean curd was light and crispy. Very generous portions of shrimp inside.\n\nOne shocker is that tea is only $1 here, awesome! Menu doesn't have much variety outside of the standard dim sum items. They do have some rice lunch specials from 11am to 3pm. Service is good, restaurant is clean. Bathrooms are shared with a couple other office spaces in the back, but the door leading to it is broken, so you can't come back the same way and have to exit the building to go into the restaurant again. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back again because the prices are too expensive for food that isn't spectacular.", "author": "Nicole M."}

It is pretty obvious that a place like hong kong lounge has higher quality in certain items, such as the egg tarts. The choices are fair in range but again, its somewhat limited. Also the price is very high for dim sum, given the okay quality and small portions.\n\nRecommend: the shrimp and peashoot leaf dumpling, the panfried mixed mushroom dumpling, chinese broccoli, the fried sesame balls.", "author": "Crystal Y."}

I asked if they're sure this is what I ordered and if they can double check. She constantly said yes beef and chicken come with this dish and I said but the title of the dish is seafood and tofu AND it was under the seafood options so why is there beef and chicken? Knowing that the other options were beef and chicken I specifically chose from the seafood menu for a reason.\n\nI honestly don't wanna review the other items I ordered because those items were not all that great either.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Whack. \n\nAfter all that happened they even asked us for a tip; they literally said, \"Where's tip?

All of the food was good and the price exceptional considering we had eaten earlier that week at Yank Sing in the financial district and it was good but for the price I'd pick Dim Sum Club.  \n\nFood - 5 stars food was very good and freshly prepared as we were in early and the kitchen started to crank out the food. \nAtmosphere- 3 stars not great but clean and in good shape.\nService - 4 stars Considering the time of day, they did great in getting our food out and keeping up with us on refills. \nPrice - 5 stars  - We had a great early lunch for about $20 a piece before tip!", "author": "Ron P."}

But I'll tell you what I did remember: dim sum is some damn good drunk food. Oh, and that you have to these weird ascending steps in the back to get to the bathroom. \n\nOkay, okay. I remember other things:\n*****\nI. FOOD & DRINK\nFor drinks, they have your typical coke products, tea, and Tsingtao. Get a Tsingtao, because it's like the best worst-beer, ever. About the food:\n\n*Har Gow: Pretty solid. The skin didn't stick to each other and the shrimp was deliciously juicy. I couldn't ask for more.\n\n*Cheong Fun: My favorite - the shrimp crepe smothered in a sweet soy-sauce. I could eat this everyday of my life. I don't care that doing so would probably give me really high blood pressure.\n\n*Shu Mai: Plump pork awesomeness. Why can't I eat this every time I'm tipsy? \n\n*Turnip Cakes: All right! Dip them in lots of soy sauce, and it's whatever...\n\n*BBQ Pork Buns: I think they were pretty nice. I was pretty tired at this point.\n\n*Xiaolongbao: Hmm, kind of thick with the dough. Juice was hot fire, though. \n\n**Deep Fried Pork Chive Dumplings: There were crumbs on my face and grease stains on my pants. So I would say good! \n\n**Singapore Street Noodles: Don't know why we got this, but it was all right. I wouldn't order it again.\n\nSo yeah, overall, the meal was pretty legit considering the circumstances. Definitely have this place on your radar if you're the type to inhale ice cream in the morning because YOLO. Lol.\n\nII. SERVICE\nPretty fast! Not super friendly, but who cares. #dumplingsinmymouf\n\nIII. AMBIENCE/ D\u00c9COR\nNothing too fancy. When we went, there was an empty buffet bar and wine bottles out. Bathroom is in the back up the ascending stairs to the right. Somewhat clean. Lol.\n\nIV. PRICES\nCompared to other restaurants in The Bay, this establishment was pretty affordable!\n\nV. OVERALL\nSo if you're in San Francisco...\n-forget the greasy burger\n-look away from that Korean BBQ taco (errr maybe not)\n-and disregard the gigantic slice of pizza that's larger than your head, which could probably give you diabetes in one bite...\n\n...because your stomach will thank you for journeying to the Russian Hill hood to check out Dim Sum Club.

I'd say the average per item was just over $5, which may not seem high, but in the world of dim sum is quite pricey. \n\nWe ordered a number of dishes (see pictures) and they were all just ok. Everything felt a bit greasy, the fillings heavy and nothing really wowed me. Perhaps it was because my expectations had been built up, perhaps it just wasn't my style. Who knows.

We had an enjoyable, delicious dinner here.  If you're looking for a nice sit-down restaurant for dim sum this is your place. Finding it was a little challenging.  It's on the first floor in the middle of a multi-story building.  I didn't realize until I researched it later that it is on the ground floor of a hotel! \n\nThere is ample seating available.  We told them we might have some people joining us later and they were happy to seat us at a table that could accommodate them. Part of the fun of a place like this is trying many different dishes.  We each ordered individually but shared with each other.  One unexpected bonus was that the extremely friendly gentleman who welcomed us to the restaurant rolled a cart over to the table and cut the duck into bite sized pieces to put into buns.  It was interesting getting to watch that. Everything I ate was quite good.  The pork potstickers that I ordered were my favorite and a sesame ball was a great way to finish the meal (thanks Robert!).\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the food I did have some complaints.  The glasses for water they give you are the size of a thimble, which is a nightmare for me because I tend to drink a lot while I'm eating. I had to flag down our poor waitress at least three times for more water.  When I was ordering I asked for separate checks and that was met with resistance. When the bill came we asked if they could just divide it by four and that was refused also.  They would only divide it in two. Weird but definitely not show stoppers for coming back for more great food from the Dim Sum Club!", "author": "Chris W."}

Yes indeed, it's in the DaVinci Villa at Van Ness and Filbert, and at first, I scratched my head wondering how good could it possibly be? Y'see, I've been on a bit of a hunt for good soup dumplings ever since Jamie W. and I returned from Shanghai a few weeks ago where we had what we think were the best ones at a place called Din Tai Fung. It's ironically part of a Taiwanese-based international chain, but they treat dumplings like little pieces of culinary art complete with step-by-step instructions on how to eat them. Even their menu was gorgeous and inviting.\n\nNot so much here. It's the standard pink sheet with the checklist (photo: http://bit.ly/1OwfNMF) and gratefully no rolling carts like at Yank Sing where I always end up getting stuff I had no intention of eating. Alas, we still ate pretty heartily starting with a $6.95 bowl of Wonton Soup since it was too cold outside not to. It was good with a lighter broth and plenty of Chinese broccoli (photo: http://bit.ly/1VuwOMW). Jamie ordered the $4.50 quartet of Pan Fried Pot Stickers, and they were stellar, meaty with the right amount of crust and no need for the sweet sipping sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1kxjvxL). I decided on the $5.75 BBQ Pork Noodle Roll just because I like the softer texture (photo: http://bit.ly/1MKmsBQ).\n\nJamie enjoyed the pork filling a lot since they use liberal chunks of chashu. Of course, we needed to try the $7.50 Shanghai Dumplings because that was our primary reason for being there. Served in the traditional bamboo steam basket, the half-dozen dumplings were plump with broth, so it was a good thing we were trained so well in Shanghai on how to eat them lest we lose all the soup on our shirts (photo: http://bit.ly/1YV6XOw). We followed those up with a $4.25 basket of Vegetarian Dumplings which of course came in green wrappers, but they were surprisingly savory with mushrooms giving good unami flavor (photo: http://bit.ly/1SpIMYA). Methinks we'll be coming back to this motel.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...surprisingly good dumplings in a most unlikely place\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...fairly generic inside but plenty of booths and tables for large groups\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...speedy and friendly enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...if you can't make it to Shanghai, this'll do", "author": "Ed U."}

At my dinner this past Sunday evening I was alone in the restaurant for some of my meal and only a single couple showed up throughout the course of my meal.  But service was spot on, caring, and all of the food arrived piping hot.\n\nAn appetizer of shiu mai was just OK.  There were four shiu mai to the order and each was somewhat smaller than those I have had at other places and surmounted by a whole individual shrimp.  Yet the taste of these was pallid, not bad mind you, but not at all bright.\n\nNext up was lemon chicken, a main course priced at 13.95.  Actually, this was quite good as the white meat chicken wasn't overly breaded and there was plenty of chicken on the plate.  And the too abundant lemon sauce wasn't much too sweet.  This would be a good plate to share.\n\nI finished my meal with potstickers.

The rice was apparently very good according to mom. My siblings loved the Shang Hai-style steamed baozi. The duck was pretty standard. \n\nConclusion: a decently authentic Chinese joint in a non-Chinatown area of SF that won the Chinese Mother Seal of Approval. If you've ever dined with an Asian mother, you should know that they disapprove of almost everything.", "author": "Diya L."}

Seems like they've gotten lazy and don't take pride in their work or food at all. \n\nWhen I approached the door, the signs all said closed even though they were clearly open. Fruit flies were rampant at our table, with one flying by every few seconds. After we finished our meal, two of them promptly landed on our plates and started feasting away. Worst of all, the soup in the Shanghai dumplings was way too hot and actually burned my lip, causing a blister that turned a dark color and peeled off a couple days later. That type of disaster should only happen at a place like McDonald's, but really shouldn't happen anywhere. They were soupy though, I'll give them that. \n\nFried taro balls didn't have enough crispy fried parts and tasted room temperature. This place isn't cheap either. It was $5.75 for the rice rolls for and $7.75 just for porridge (rice and water). That's almost like daylight robbery, but I guess that's most of SF.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Or I just ordered the wrong things. But regardless, I left feeling queasy and sad. \n\nWe got the shu mai, shrimp dumplings, steamed bbq pork buns, golden yolk buns, xlb, and the beef roll with the rice noodle. \n\nGREASE. Everything was greasy and overly salty. The char siu in the pork buns was so sad... there was more gelatinous sugar \"sauce\" than actual char siu. The shrimp dumplings didn't have nice big pieces of shrimp... but more of like... a paste. \n\nBut I think the most disappointing was the XLB (xiao long bao, shanghai dumpling, whatever you wanna call it.) The soup was not even flavoured well. Instead of a nice mix of soup and filling, the filling was almost... overcooked? You know, when meat gets too cooked and starts to crumble. Imagine dry, overcooked meat in greasy soup and you've pretty much got an idea of what this xlb was like.\n\nMaybe my standards are too high, but even dollar dim sum over in china town beats this place. If you're going to charge legit dim sim prices, please deliver sit-down dim sum quality food. This place? Overpriced and mostly trying to appeal to tourists.

And I'm talking about every single dish, from the Shanghai dumplings to the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves.\n\n2) There is never a line. The location is so unusual for a Chinese restaurant (on S Van Ness Ave in Russian Hill) that most people probably don't give it a second glance... which only works to our benefit ;-)\n\n3) Prices are higher than what you'd be paying in Chinatown, but again well worth it for the convenience.\n\n4) Service is amazing. One time my boyfriend and I came in at 2:55pm, not realizing they close at 3pm, and the manager came over to us to explain the situation. It was obvious he cared about his employees yet did not want to deny us food, and he said he would make an exception for us, with a smile on his face all the while. I see him every time I come back and always feel well taken care of.\n\nPrior to discovering Dim Sum Club, scheduling a time to eat dim sum was always such an ordeal... we'd have to mentally prepare ourselves for long lines and wait times.

My boyfriend and I stumbled on this place yesterday and I had heard good things so we decided to give it a shot. There was (surprisingly?) no wait on a Sunday at noon and we were seated promptly.\n\nNow, this isn't a cart Dim Sum place. They give you a paper menu and you mark down what you want and how many orders. The waitresses come around and make a note of what you ordered. I think we waited about 10 minutes from when the waitress came around until our first dish arrived. Between the two of us, we had:\n\n-Steamed BBQ Pork Buns: We agree that THESE ARE THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD. Keep in mind, neither of us are very experienced in our Dim Sum cuisine so its possible that these are actually average and we just have eaten worse. Either way-we really enjoyed them!\n\n-Steamed Spare Ribs: These were ok. We ordered these to try something new and while they tasted good, they were difficult to eat. I probably just am not a fan of this dish in general rather than DSC's execution\n\n-Steamed Homemade Dumpling: Really good and had a bit of a kick! I am not sure what these are filled with, but I am pretty sure there is shrimp and pork from what I could see. These were really big and generous.\n\n-Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf: Standard but enjoyable. \n\nFor these 4 dishes, with tax, it was $18.50 which is reasonable. The one thing we didn't like is that they charge for tea which I have only seen at Yank Sing. This is a very minor complaint as the charge was only $1/person but it did sway us not to order it.\n\nOverall, I would come back if I were in the area.

I don't have much experience in this area of food honestly, but it looked good and it tasted decent. \nWe just got a bunch of appetizers. Shrimp dumplings, pork and shrimp sui mai, steamed pork buns, and shanghai dumplings. Our favorite was the shanghai dumplings and the sui mai. They had the most flavor. The shrimp dumplings were a bit dull and the steamed pork buns, well... no. It was my first time trying them and they were not what I expected them to be like. But at least I tried them! They tasted kind of like a cinnamon roll which threw us off. It all looked good so I think if you like dim sum more then you would like this place.

With Dim Sum Club, I no longer have to subject myself to hours old dim sum, warmed up by the radiator of my hotel room.\n\nThere were two parts of my meal. Regular menu and the special pink menu that they only reserve for the real Asians in the know (apparently Xerxes and I don't count).\n\nA few standout dishes (which is hard to remember since our table was literally plates on plates on plates):\n- Har Gow: Easily, one of my favorite dumplings we ordered a basket for each person at the table...plus more. We were hungry using up all of our brain power that day ok!?!? These shrimps must have come from radiated waters because they were cartoon size! Not that I was complaining. The dumpling wrapper was delicate and the perfect carby foil to those big ass skrimps.\n- Shrimp Crepes: Pretty much har gow in crepe form but as I said we used a lot of brain power that day. \n- BBQ Pork Buns - An even meat to bun to ratio and stuffed full of tasty, tasty morsels of red tinged meat. The breading was soft and fresh.\n- Turnip Cakes: On point \n- Singapore Street Noodles: Dumplings are not exactly the most filling thing in the world so this was a good way to coat our tummies with something before we got into the real deal pink menumeal.\n\nWhich...I cannot even talk correctly about since our table leader ordered everything in Cantonese. Let's just call it even and say it was delicious.\n\nMy favorite menu item was an egg omelette with more of those big ass shrimps tossed in. The eggs had the texture of Charmin Ultra Soft + Fluffy White Clouds + Unicorn Magic all mixed together. It was a simple, homey dish that had me googling recipes as soon as I got on the plane.\n\nIf I were a local, I'd be clubbin' here every weekend.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

The signature dish that pulled it off was the chow mein (HK Style) which means it's crispy noodles that compliments the ingredients.

Although some of the dishes had been sold out because of the time we were there,, we did get a complimentary dessert which was mango pudding. I, wouldn't mind coming here to eat dim sum again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-13", "description": "My cousin wanted to have Sunday lunch near her house at this dim sum place. I was skeptical of this place, especially when my cousin told me it was a little dinky place attached to a hotel near her apartment. After the trek up the hill onto Van Ness, I was surprised. It was not as dinky as she described it was, or maybe my definition of dinky is skewed.\n\nWe were promptly greeted by a waiter that recognized my cousin. Apparently when we went they just opened at most a few months ago and it used to be a hotel restaurant. Whatever that means. It was a bit busy, we had to wait a few minutes for a table. We were offered a booth but figured since we wanted to taste... I don't know maybe the entire menu we opted to wait for a bigger table.\n\nAfter a few minutes a table left and we were prompted to sit and peruse the menu. We ended up ordering a lot of food, we had an extended table and that filled up too. I have noticed they don't utilize the space of the restaurant well enough, it seems they could do better but that's just me. They have an open kitchen in the front with another smaller one in the back.\n\nAs we placed the order we started talking about what is going on in our lives and after a while we all thought, hmm it's taking a bit of time. Wrong statement to say because after that our half a roasted duck came, our shrimp dumpling came, then the chicken feet, then the Shanghai dumplings, then the Shu Mai and on and on and on quickly too one right after another, until all our dishes came out and it all smelled and looked amazing. We spent about 80 bucks for 4 people and we were stuffed. \n\nThe color on the roasted duck was really nice and it wasn't too fat. The steamed rice rolls tasted fresh, just made and not sandy at all. They also include a side of vegetables with the steamed rice rolls. The rest of the dim sum tasted so good, I can't go into detail on why it tasted good because frankly I can't remember everything we ordered.\n\nAnother thing that was delicious was the salt and pepper fried chicken wings. The light batter along with the almost perfect frying time for the chicken wings accompanied with the salt and pepper. MMM makes me want to go back for more. I think the only things that we could've skipped was the dumplings (some soup dumplings) and the pan fried green chives dumplings. The soup one you could get better at San Tung in Sunset district and the pan fried green chives dumpling, the skin was too gooey. Now gooey isn't a bad thing, but too gooey gets stuck in your teeth and is a bit of an annoyance to eat.\n\nThe waiters and waitress are all so pleasant. I was told they have dim sum in the evenings also. I must go back. In one hand I wish them all the business they can possibly have, but if that happens, then I can never get a table when I want to.\n\nOh well, I hope this place stays fantastic. Trust that I'll be back.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Harry P."}

(assuming you arrive by 1130 or closer to 1pm) We ordered too much food here and walked out with a little bit of leftovers; $16pp for 4, but could be a few bucks less if we ordered in moderation. They had some slightly different variations on dishes than I've seen in other dim sum places, e.g.: salted pork bone porridge, spare rib noodle rolls - thought those were gonna have the paiguat rolled up inside, but it was served on top of the steamed rolled noodles), a lotus paste sesame ball (really yummy).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-09", "description": "I wanted to like this place coz I like dim sum made to order, it's a lot more fresh that way. But sorry, apart from this aspect this place falls short in everything else. \n\nWe went on a weekend and there were plenty of vacant tables, which isn't a good sign. But that's not the first thing that you notice - the smell hits you right when you walk in. It's soooooo oily and stuffy in there! \n\nThere aren't a lot to choose from, but we managed to order some of the usual items. The food came pretty quickly, which is kind of expected because there weren't too many tables and the staff seemed to be idle most of the time. \n\nI'll just comment on the things NOT to order (in case you REALLY want to try this place still):\n\nRice roll (Cheung fun) with fried dough - the original name is called 'ja leung' in Cantonese. It looked good but when I took a bite, I realized the dough was toooooo deep-fried there's no 'dough' in it, it's just a crispy piece. This is NOT what ja leung should be like, but granted, most if not all Bay Area dim sum places don't get this right. I'm just disappointed because it looked really promising. \n\nSteamed bun with egg yolk - these looked horrible when they landed on our table. They looked as if there was an explosion and the egg yolk bursted. They just looked so wrong! The taste was okay though but I still find them slightly over-steamed because the egg yolk wasn't in liquid form. \n\nWe also ordered har gow, siu mai, sesame balls and some vegetable dumplings. They were all okay but nothing to write home about. \n\nAgain, if this place charges what most other chinese restaurants in the area charge, then it's not terrible, just nothing I would recommend. But the prices are way higher than other places (most dim sum items being at least $1.5-2 higher than other places in the area), so you naturally expect more, given there's also no decor to speak of (not to mention the stuffiness). I would say, avoid this place, there are many much better options in the city.", "author": "Essie L."}

On one hand, the food is pretty good, service acceptable, room is OK and it serves dim sum for dinner.  On the other, it's kind of expensive and the room is actually the hotel's breakfast buffet room.  \n\n3 of us went there the celebrate a friend's birthday for dinner.  Thought it would a little different than your standard Chinese restaurant.  On a Tuesday around 6:30pm, the place was pretty empty and we had our pick of tables or booths.  Service came quickly and brought us tea and water.  We ordered some sui mai and cha sui bau to start.  Both were very good.  Turns out the dim sum is made to order.\n\nLater we ordered their ma po tofu and chicken with double mushrooms and some rice.  Both dishes were also very good, although the ma po tofu was a little spicy for us.\n\nThe bad: prices are high.  Not Yang SIng high, but Dim Sum Club is not that nice.  Paper napkins, hotel buffet room, not really high end.  More like good Chinese restaurant quality at twice the price.\n\nWe figured they were catering more the tourist crowd or the local Union St crowd.

I've ordered this at countless dimsum places and the outside was always thick and the inside was never juicy. This was pretty legit! Thin outer layer and the meat was very juicy and aromatic. They even give you spoons on the side so the soup won't spill out (:\n\n-Salt and Pepper Chicken Wing ($4.50, 4 pieces): definitely not what I expected. It was pretty interesting; they made it into a \"lollipop chicken style\" by taking one of the two bones out and pushing all the meat to one end to make it look like a lollipop. It was pretty fun to eat, but they added too much batter to fry this so the crust was too thick. The flavor was great though. Came with a mayo dipping sauce.\n\n-Deep Fried Pork Puff ($3.50): this was \"whatevers\" to me, because of my own personal preference. I like the outside to be thicker and more chewy. This was thin and crunchy. My grandparents loved this because they like crunchy stuff so I guess it's really up to you.\n\n-Curry Samosas ($2.95): wow. This was surprisingly really good. The flavors really hit us and it was a great snack to have. The dipping sauce was pretty good and wasn't watered down.

The taro on the inside was smooth and tasty with the meat and sauce. UUUGH SO GOOD.\n\n-Shrimp Dumpling ($4.75): this was okay, nothing special. Just your average shrimp dumpling I guess. \n\n-Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai ($3.75): another okay dish.

But they put tons of meat, seafood, veggies in it.\n- chicken feet with black bean sauce : it was too salty for me so i ended up not finishing it.\n- deep fried durian pancakes were pretty good. \n\nService:\nQuick and friendly. \n\nParking :\nA bit hard to find parking spot here on Sunday but i am not sure about the other days.\n\nAmbience : \nEven though it is like a place where you will get a breakfast buffet during your stay at the hotel, it is clean enough for chinese food restaurant. It is not that big, compare to hong kong lounge.", "author": "Ulrica J."}

Several pieces of beef, white onion, and green onion in a brown sauce, which was soaked up in the crispy noodles they served under everything.  I would not order again and if the server bothered to ask, I would have recommended they look into changing the dish.\n\nThe Chicken with double mushroom dish was very good and was twice the portion of the Mongolian Beef dish, which was good,  because we didn't eat much of the Mongolian Beef. The mushrooms were fresh and cooked just right so they weren't mushy. The chicken was also very good: Not fatty scraps a lot of restaurants use. \n\nThe rice was the normal sticky rice found everywhere: no better,  no worse.\n\nService was mixed: We were seated promptly, water was refilled several times, but there was no follow up after the food was served and the beef dish was served several minutes before the chicken dish.\n\nIt's what you would expect from a restaurant attached to a hotel.", "author": "Pat T."}

What the (head, pale skinned, jade bracelet) waitress (that doesn't smile) ended up doing was slicing it even more with a scissors to make it look intentionally chopped.

There was our table and I think two or three other smaller tables were occupied, otherwise it was empty.\n\nThe food (I didn't do the ordering, so some names may be vague):\n\nWalnut shrimp: bland and starchy/slimy; walnuts were good;\n\nSalt and pepper shrimp: bland but otherwise ok - at least for the first few bites; didn't want to continue eating it after multiple flies had landed on the plate;\n\nSoup dumplings: the top of them was too chewy or almost hard, like it dried out before steaming. The soup inside was pretty flavorless and the meat felt grainy, the texture was definitely off. \n\nBeef chow mein: The beef had a weird sponge-like texture, noodles were greasy, not very well flavored;\n\nChinese broccoli: this dish actually seemed fresh and was ok if slightly overcooked.\n\nSiu mai: again, flavorless and weird grainy meat texture;\n\nThe owner seemed apologetic about the flies and brought us complimentary steamed buns, but that in no way redeems such a huge hygiene problem and mediocre-to-bad food - sorry. The quality of  the food was nowhere close to what I have had at other places in the Richmond and Sunset. I guess I have to keep going there.", "author": "Anna L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-08", "description": "Dim Sum Club is a great restaurant because of the unique combination of the following:\n\n1. Location: Within walking distance of Russian Hill, Nob Hill, Pac Heights - areas that traditionally lack good dim sum eats.\n\n2. Dim Sum at all (open) hours: You can get dim sum for dinner! For takeout! To supplement a meal! As your entire meal!\n\n3. Decent food: Of course, (1) and (2) would be meaningless if the food wasn't good - but it is. Set your expectations in that while it's not the absolute best the city has to offer, it is consistent and delicious. The sesame balls are most definitely above-par. The sticky rice dishes are great too. Xiao long bao has a slightly tough skin but is still quite good.\n\nOverall, I feel lucky to have this as a dim sum option nearby for dine-in and takeout.", "author": "Alyssa W."}

Ok let me break it down for you: \nFirst the tea should always be boiling hot. It should be so hot that once you pour the tea in the cup you cant quickly drink it you have to slowly sip it becuase dim sum is some heavy shit. You would feel shitty eating dim sum with out drinking hot tea. Does dim sum club serve tea like that? Nope. To top it off, the tea pot that they gave us was disgusting looking. It had that dried out tea scum all over the top. Come on man!! You are not a hole in the wall place ok. If you going to charge me for tea, you best clean that shit up! U know wat im sayin!!\n\nOk. Now lets move on to the dim sum. First of all, there's not too much variety to choose from. Its just your basic dim sum. You would think they would get it right? Wrong!!! We ordered cilantro churng fun, leuy sa tong yoon, loh bak goh, fung jau, loh mai gai, and seafood jook. The churng fun(rice noodle w/cilantro) was ok but the sweet soyu they used was a lil off. So that was wacked. The leuy sa tong yoon(mochi w/sweet sesame filling was horrible. The mochi part wasnt fresh and the filling was dddrrry!! Wacked. The loh bak goh(daikon cake) just tasted like flour. Wacked. The fung jau(chicken feet) was saaaaalty!!! Wickety wacked!! The loh mai gai (steamed sticky rice) was ok but very oily. Sorta wacked. The only thing that i actually liked  was the seafood jook (rice soup). The consistency was good and the seafood was fresh. Yhat was worth 2stars.

I think I'm going to crave this for a long time to come.\n\nThe long: I hate to write this review because I want it to stay a unknown secret. Had family coming into town and they had been saying they had to go to San Fran while they were in town, but couldn't tell me ANYTHING that they just really wanted to do there. Until they got there and at the last minute rattled off their requests after we parked halfway across town from anything they wanted to do. Yeah I was pulling my hair out. So after doing a few stops they tossed out they wanted dim sum and I fired up my trusty Yelp app. Well all the touristy spots were far away, but there was this new and hot place with a lot of amazing reviews and it was close. Away we went. The place is kind of one of those places you would walk right by and never see if you were not looking for it. Once we got inside it was full of ethnic diners which is an amazing sign in my book. We got sat and given a menu and we scribbled out everything we wanted and just waited. There were 6 of us in total and we all ordered about 3-4 items a piece not really knowing what to expect. Then the food came. Oh crap we ordered WAY too much. We worked our way through the waves of food that came to the table and not a single thing was complained about. Everyone loved everything and we had at least a good 15 different items on the table. We were expecting a heart attack when the ticket came and we were right it took my breath away. For the feast of yummy goods we got our total bill was just under $30. I thought it had to be a mistake but everything was on the bill. I will definitely be coming back here on my next time in the area.\n\nWhat works: AMAZING food and insane prices. As a bonus it isn't loaded with tourists so no screaming babies or people complaining because they didn't know what they were in for.\n\nWhat to improve: Service was a little slow to get going and there seemed to be a communication problem, but nothing that couldn't be overlooked.", "author": "Patrick M."}

Poor customer service if you ask me.", "author": "Alison M."}

Dim sum was very good (not as good as Koi Palace good) but pretty decent.  Service was fine.  Prices on par.  I thought some of the portion sizes were big compared to other chinese dim sum places.  It was just a little hot in there temperature wise - they need to turn on the a/c or a fan especially on a warm day (schweatty!).", "author": "Mr. C."}

Mostly empty tables and\nyet service is still slow.  The main problem I see is that the help speaks little or no English\nand it is very hard to communicate without repeating yourself and not understanding\nwhat the help is saying.  \n\nFood is okay, but we found the chow mein a little pricey for what you get which was more noodles than the main ingredients and also a bit too oily.  Dim sum was okay, good but nothing great.  All items have the same identical price, which is strange.\n\nThere is a great opportunity for them to do very well here, but they seem to lack the know how of running a business and need to hire English speaking help....because most all of their customers only understand English.  They also need to reevaluate their pricing.\nThe menu does not clearly describe the dishes they offer and so it is super important\nthat you have a waitress that speaks English to clearly describe what you are getting.\nWas hoping to make this one of our favorite Chinese food eating place, but we were left disappointed.", "author": "Girly Foodie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "I'm a pretty big Chinese food snob. I mean, I like the Americanized stuff like Panda Express but it's not Chinese food. I always tell everyone about how disappointed I am by Chinese food in San Francisco for being Americanized under the guise of authentic and expensive. I'm from the San Gabriel Valley of southern California where good Chinese food is everywhere because the population is so densely Chinese. I have always said and maintain that the worst Chinese restaurant there would be one of the best here. Long story short, I've eaten a lot of Chinese food in my life and a lot of dim sum.\n\nI was shocked to find that a pretty legit Chinese place (with dim sum, no less!) had opened half a block from me and in a shady touristy hotel I ass daily. I was skeptical at first but the good reviews inspired me to take a stab at it.\n\nI tried it out for lunch and I pleasantly surprised. Here's what I got to go:\n- salted pork bone rice porridge - huge portion and comes with fried cruller (you tiao), green onions and pickled stuff on the side. It was delicious and I greatly appreciated the condiments. The meat was on the bone and very flavorful. The porridge itself had a lot of green onions and other greens in it already, so in the future I may request green onions on the side only if it's possible. \n- black bean chicken feet - yeah, I'm THAT Chinese. It was a good portion for the price and was very flavorful. In restaurants, it usually comes with more sauce but it may just be because I got it to go. It was also cut up into smaller pieces than it's usually served but that's not a big deal.\n- salted custard buns - it was as advertised but still not what I expected. The saltiness was not what i had anticipated but it was in the description so it was my own fault. I still ate it and thought it was good.\n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful when I asked questions. The packaging is very nice, especially for a Chinese restaurant. The prices are pretty good, especially for San Francisco. How do I get those free pineapple buns though!?\n\nWould love to try dining in and testing out the other dishes. So far though, VERY promising and perfect to scratch my dim sum itch in between visits to LA.", "author": "K C."}

As a bonus, it's terrific to have such a high quality dim sum restaurant in a different part of town. Okay, it's my part of town, but nonetheless.....only thing is it's a bit noisy in there -- it was half full when we were in for lunch, and we had to speak loudly to hear each other.  But who cares? As soon as the food arrived -- which was very soon indeed -- no one wanted to talk any more!", "author": "Mini N."}

Particularly, the duck skin had been well prepared, since all the fat under the skin were carefully removed before serving. We also tried Beef w/ Cilantro Noodle Roll, Egglpant w/ Black Bean Sauce, Bean Curd Roll w/ Oyster Sauce, and Bean Curd Skin Roll w/ Shrimp. We like all of them.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-21", "description": "DSC was a big disappointment.\nWe come once a year to SF for a foodie trip and dim sum is one of our favorite food particularly in SF. We were so glad to hear about \"good\" dim sum place in the area where we stay and did have our hopes high.\n But our experience was not good at all and we are so sorry to waste our money and time here.\nThe taste of the food was very mediocre. Eatable but nothing flavorful or interesting about it. The choices are very limited.\nThe service was ridiculous. Trying to be\" more modern\" then the regular places of Chinatown, but at the same time not knowing elementary rules about servicing the client. Our waitress literally took it as an insult when we tried to ask her to bring extra little spoons for the vinegar that comes with XLB. We HAD to explain to her WHY do we need it and even after the explanation she acted like we hurt her feelings and she was kind of rude for the rest of the time. Probably couldn't wait for us to leave as soon as possible. We also observed how she was acting towards other patrons commending them to the seats she chooses for them, not the ones they pointed out to her were they would like to sit. And BTW the whole room had only 2 tables occupied. Very impolite. \nFinally the value of the meal was WAY overpriced for the quality of the experience.\nToo bad we didn't take in to consideration the negative reviews points.\nNeedless to say we are not going to be back or recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Tatyana M."}
