The waiter was a little bit gruff - when asked about the menu he explained it was prix fixe but read the choices to us, didn't describe or elaborate. Bread is available but only if you notice the fine print at the top of the menu. It's a thick cut mild ?sourdough with whipped butter that could use come salt. \n\nOur first course was a sunchoke soup which was delish and filling for a mildly cold fall evening. We could've done without the garganelli and cauliflower pasta which was a monotone dish minus the botarga. The risotto was good. My friend seemed to enjoy her branzino. My beef cheeks were perfectly cooked but my endive and ?fennel were oversauced and drowned by the creamed potatoes. \n\nWe both hated our chocolate bread pudding as the banana peel taste was overpowering.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-30", "description": "Thanks to the generosity and good-taste of my friend, I was able to try some delicious foods and desserts here at Trestle!\n\nTrestle is, what many consider, fine dining at an affordable price (I guess affordable can mean many things. Since my friend and I aren't rich, it wasn't pocket money, but we did not regret trying out Trestle).\n\nTrestle has a revolving menu every week (I believe). However, the format is always the same: Appetizer, Optional Pasta Addition for +$10, Main Entree, and Dessert. There are two options for each category. Note that the three-course meal comes out to be $38 (always, that is, unless you add the pasta).\n\nToday's menu consisted of the following: Stone Fruit Salad/Summer Tomato Soup, \"Paella Style\" Risotto/Broccoli Orecchiette, Petrale Sole Meunier/Braised Beef Short Rib, and Japanese Style Cheesecake/Chocolate Pot de Creme. My friend and I each got something different (besides the salad) due to differing preferences as well as an attempt to try everything! \n\nTo make this review short, I would just say that everything was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.\nBut, I thought I should share more details. However, since the menu changes frequently...I will just share my overall impression of what made the food fantastic:\n\n-Everything was fresh\n-Everything was of high-quality (meats, fruits, chocolate, etc)\n-Meats were tender and flavorful\n-Everything had distinct flavors that both surprised and pleased your palate (For instance, the Stone Fruit Salad consisted of such fresh, perfectly sweet/tangy fruit that had a delectable crisp. Also, the cheese-Yogurt Like Burrata they used complimented both the salad and fruits so well. Even the mini cherry tomatoes they included were just sweet and tangy enough and delightfully crispy. This was just the salad folks!)\n\nThe service was superb (so quick, attentive, and pleasant). Trestle really provides quality service as well as efficient and strategic delivery of food. The transitioning between each course was impeccable.\n\nThe dining area is so beautiful, evenly spaced out, and clean. They literally wipe your table after every course. Also, there was never a point when my glass was empty!\n\nThere really is nothing that I can pinpoint that doesn't reflect five stars.\n\nNote: It gets packed fairly quickly, so it's a good idea to make a reservation (just like my thoughtful and prepared friend did).", "author": "Christine H."}

A 3-course meal for $38 pp. The menu rotates weekly I believe. Beautifully plated, tasty food, and great service! We made a reservation a couple weeks in advanced for me and my boyfriend's anniversary on a Saturday night.... and I am sure glad we did, they were turning people away who didn't have a reservation because it was fully booked! \n\nWe basically got everything on the menu. The portions may look small but if you add a pasta, it is DEFINITELY enough. \n\nAppetizers: Tuna Nicoise and Sweet Corn Soup- I personally liked the soup better, but the tuna was good as well. \n\nWe added the Tomato Risotto for $10 extra- was worth it and big enough to share between the two of us. \n\nEntrees: Crispy Skin Salmon and Flat Iron Steak. I had the Salmon and it was PERFECTLY cooked. \n\nDessert: There was Coconut Custard and Tiramisu which was the most beautifully plated and the perfect ending to a savory meal. \n\nWe also got a bottle of wine ($48)- Sauvignon Blanc- which the waiter suggested and was perfect.

This is a pre fixe menu with each course having two options for a very reasonable price of $38 + $10 pasta supplement pp. The service was a bit strange. We made it clear that we would be sharing all of the courses, so we requested a separate small plate to have, yet for each course, they would remove our 'place setting'. When we requested another set of small dishes, we were met with a bit of annoyance. \n\nThe food portions were great, and we were really full by the end of the meal. Overall, it felt that many of the dishes were very rich with cheese in its base or as a topping. Based on the late June menu, the apps were a bit lackluster - a corn elote inspired soup (a little too rich, needed some acidity) + seared tuna salad (sizable cuts of tuna with fresh mix of greens and veggies). The pasta supplement included a vegetarian/cheesy garganelli + shrimp risotto (a little salty) but overall fairly good. Mains included salmon (a bit overcooked, tasty crispy exterior but dry interior) + short rib (too heavily salted but the fresh green beans added great crunch and contrast). The desserts were middle of the fairway, consisting of  deep chocolate 'brownie' and a fruit flavored pana cotta. Meh, ok, but we didn't finish them if that gives you a sign. \n\nWorth checking out, since the menu rotates each week.From taking a look over several weeks, the menu structure is similar from week to week.", "author": "Julia K."}

I came on a Friday night with a reservation to celebrate my friend's birthday, and we both had exceptional experiences with the menu. I would highly recommend having a reservation, and booking early in advance if possible. The restaurant is located on a small corner near Chinatown, and it can be very difficult to find parking. \n\nThe restaurant consists of a prix fixed menu for $38, with a choice of an appetizer, entree, dessert and an optional pasta course for an additional $10. That night, I ordered the stone fruit salad starter, the hanger steak, and the Japanese cheesecake. The stone fruit salad was delicious and light, and I loved the whipped burrata on top. It also had a very light dressing and a splash of sesame seeds for crunch. The hanger steak was also very good, and the steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. I loved the combination of the avocado and the puree at the bottom. I had a bite of my friends pasta, and it was definitely some of the best pasta I have yet to have. It was very chewy, and perfectly cooked with the addition of crunchy broccoli rabe and shaved cheese. My favorite course was the Japanese cheesecake! It tasted nothing like a traditional cheesecake, and tasted more like a dense, spongy cake. \n\nI would also recommend asking for their bread!

No where can you find such a great value in SF.  Most entrees are already $30-40.  They change their menu quite frequently due to the limited selection of choice of one of 2 appetizers, pasta, entree and dessert courses.  Even if you went twice in one week, the dishes may be different.  I'm all about value, but it has to taste great, which Trestle completely delivers.  The chicken was moist and the vegetables that it came with was crispy.  The red pepper soup was a pleasant surprise.  It was slightly sweet and had a depth of red pepper flavor.  The fresh green pea risotto was the right amount of creamy and the rice is still intact with a little bit of chew.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-23", "description": "A Blessing\n\nTrestle is a blessing. In a city that manages to somehow continuously overprice everything, Trestle has emerged as an initiatives driven by talented chefs (please welcome Michelin-starred Claudio Dell'Anno of Ciccio to the restaurant) to make fine dining accessible to people who can't afford to go out and drop $150 or $300 for ten-course tasting menus. \n\nThe exceptional thing about Trestle (outside of how they challenge themselves constantly creatively by having ever changing menus) is the extent to which they genuinely strive to create a fine dining experience. It would be exceptionally easy for a restaurant with famous chefs to market a moderately expensive three course menu that is filled with average ingredients and comprised of simple ordinary dishes and make lots of money. \n\nInstead, Trestle doesn't skimp on ingredients or experience. In my meal, there was crab, smoked salmon, steak, and a variety of other high class expensive ingredients. Moreso than that, they were executed with elegance that translated on the plate. The crab and avocado rissotto was unbelievable, and the hangar steak was quite possibly the most tender piece of meat I've ever had. The smoked salmon salad was gorgeous, and had a proper proportion of smoked salmon (unlike some cash strapped delis that I've been to). Without going too deep into the menu that I was fortunate enough to experience (I don't want to make the reader too jealous after all), I can comment that the food was lovely, the aesthetic was gorgeous, and that this has become one of my favorite restaurants in the city.\n\nAlso if you're a progressive cuisine enthusiast, the restaurant group that operates Trestle makes a genuine effort to treat their employees humanely. They get decent wages (a rarity), full-benefits (almost unheard of), and some lovely additional bonuses that indicates the owners are interested in their employees as human beings outside of their food production value.

The complete, multi-course part is certainly true, although I'd take issue with the \"traditional\" part in a good way, as I found the offerings to be quite up-to-date. \n\nI stopped by with a mid-sized group several months ago and found everything I chose quite enjoyable. A delicata squash salad (castelfranco, blue cheese, compressed apple, maple vinaigrette) was a refreshing, palate-priming way to start the meal. An optional $10 pasta add-on in the form of coconut risotto with rock shrimp, serrano chili, and marcona almond was savory and worthwhile.\n\nNext, the braised beef short ribs with congee, bok choy, and spiced beef broth all looked deceivingly small, but packed a decisively hearty and satisfying punch. The chocolate butter cake dessert with dark chocolate, cranberry, and 24K gold gelee was every bit as heavenly as it looked on paper.\n\nService was professional and reasonably engaging, and there was a decent number of drinks to choose from as well. As the food itself - $38 for the core three-course menu (plus $10 for the pasta add-on) - you'd be hard-pressed to find such quality ingredients and execution anywhere in the West Bay for such a minimal price. \n\nThe experience is family-style; there's no bar seating in the venue, as there are only tables that fit about 30 people in total. All in all, worth trying with a small to mid-sized group.", "author": "Vincent L."}

The food was exceptional and the service ran so well that it almost felt choreographed. The place is small but very pretty. \n\nThere were so many little touches that made this a special experience. First of all, I'd marked this as an anniversary occasion when I booked on Open Table, but I was amazed by the level of attention we received. The hostess greeted us with \"Happy Anniversary\" the moment we arrived. A card from the restaurant awaited us at our table. And dessert at the end of the meal featured a thin chocolate square with a \"Happy Anniversary\" message piped on it. Such nice touches that went well beyond anything we expected!\n\nAll of the service and plating showed that same attention to detail. Soup was poured from a small pitcher around creme fraiche in a bowl. Silverware was replaced and painstakingly arranged on the table between courses. Water glasses were filled silently and efficiently by the waiter always hovering nearby. No fears here that the waiter will disappear on you. It feels like you have a small staff catering to you.\n\nI was very happy with the wine list, but most important was the food. When serving a prix fixe menu, the food really needs to be perfect and they pretty much nailed it. Unfortunately we had eaten a fairly late lunch (not planned) and were too full for the bread or supplemental pasta course, but ordered one of everything on the main menu and shared. The menu included fingerling potato soup and summer squash salad as starters, pork schnitzel and crispy-skin salmon as mains, and Black Forest cake and lemon tea cake as desserts.\n\nThe food is exquisitely plated here and laid out like little jewels. As full as we were, it was a fairly light meal where I don't think we would have felt stuffed afterwards if only we'd walked in super hungry -- but I prefer not to feel weighed down after I eat.

It's a great place with a 3 course menu at a reasonable price ($38 per person) ! The options seem to change daily. You can choose a soup or salad (tomato and burrata salad or the coconut soup. We had a choice of 2 pastas (for an extra 10 dollar charge per dish) and an entr\u00e9e followed by a dessert. I tried the Thai tuna pasta and beef curry gnocchi and had the pacific sole with black rice with bok choy. The presentation of the dishes were fantastic and the staff were very patient. They are very accommodating and provided a nice happy birthday note for my mom ! The coconut soup was delicious with the chicken and egg and a hint of lime. Of the 2 pasta options I loved the gnocchi with beef curry. This was perfectly flavored! The sole was delicious and fried but my only comment would be that this dish was especially salty. Way wayyyy too salty (I toggle between a 4 and 5 for this because the other dishes were amazing but the main entr\u00e9e should be the star and more carefully executed). We all agreed that the salt was overdone (in the rice, on the fish, in the sauce... Whoa !). The flavors were great but the salt kind of made it not as pleasant to enjoy. Lastly the chocolate budino was a lovely finish to the meal! I'd come again and try their selection. I did enjoy my time and appreciated the organized fashion and the attentiveness of the staff.", "author": "Natalie M."}

Seven dishes between the two of us for $86 and each one of them prepared to perfection.  The dishes are unfussy but refined farm-to-table fare and almost every dish was perfectly executed.

The strong flavors on the pineapple tomato salad made it much more memorable than expected and the cous cous combined with the squash soup to make a familiar type of soup stand head and shoulders above the rest. The strong flavors on tomato arrabbiata pasta ($10 addition) once gain belied their simplicity and the smooth chewy texture on the flat iron fake was really distinctive for flat iron steak.  The only slight miss was the rockfish which was strong, but didn't have any really special to make it stand out.\n\nDessert was also more pleasurable than most places.\n\nService was efficient and friendly.

Since it was a Monday, I was luckily able to snag prime 6:30 pm reservations just a couple days beforehand.\n\nThe menu options varies on a daily basis (you can always see the menu for the day on the website), but to give you an idea, on the day we went they had (*indicates what we picked):\n\n~~Appetizers~~\nOrange and permisson salad: castelfranco radicchio, quince jam, herbed yogurt\n*Coconut curry soup: tofu, green tobiko, tempura maitake, cilantro\n\n~~Optional $10 pasta course~~\nMushroom risotto: marcarpone, king trumpet, marjoram\nUni bucatini: calabrian chili crouton, meyer lemon\n\n~~Mains~~\n*Pan-roasted corvina: beluga lentils, onion broth, prosciutto chip\nPiquillo stuffed chicken: hummos, spigarello, harissa jus\n\n~~Desserts~~\n*Pear fritter: caramelized white chocolate cremeux, poached pear puree\nSweet & salty marcona almonds, caramel sauce, rocky road ice cream\n\nLast time I thought the dessert was the weakest course, this time I thought it was the coconut curry soup. Neither my friend nor I were a fan as the flavors were too strong. It didn't help that the soup was overly salty, which wasn't a good combination with the strong flavors. Neither of us finished this.\n\nWe both skipped the optional pasta course, as we weren't too hungry.\n\nMy favorite course was the corvina, which is a fish. I had never heard of it before and resorted to a quick google search before ordering to figure out what it was. It was roasted perfectly! My biggest problem with ordering fish at most restaurants is that it's usually overcooked and dry, but that wasn't a problem here at all. I also adored the lentils and the prosciutto bits and chips that accompanied the dish. I could not get enough of everything on my plate.\n\nI also loved my dessert.

Came here with a friend on Monday evening with reservations at 8 pm. We were seated before our scheduled reservation which was nice since there is not a bar area to wait at. \n\nWhat I enjoy best about prix fixe dinners is the lack of choices for amazing food so I can quickly make a decision and make my belly happy quicker! We sat down and was asked if we wanted tap or sparkling water and then the waiter took our drink order. \n\nMy friend and I both ordered the same three items: the red kuri squash soup, the crispy-skin striped bass, and the chocolate roulade for dessert. Simple as that. We could have got both sets of prix fixe dinners and shared but the heart and belly want what the heart and belly want. \n\nThe red kuri squash soup came out first. They brought out a bowl filled with spicy pepitas, maple creme fraise, and arugula (you all know I'm a sucker for arugula). Then they poured the squash soup over he ingredients in the bowl for you to mix. The soup was excellent: creamy, tasty, and full of freshness!\n\nThe crispy skin striped bass came next. It is perfectly portioned and the skin has been fried to perfection. Sitting on top of grilled brussel sprouts with a side of mashed potatoes, it was nicely paired. I normally have a strong dislike for brussel sprouts but I ate it all!\n\nWe ended the evening with the chocolate roulade cake which had wildflower cr\u00e9meaux, caramel, and Orange segment.

We arrived early and instead got a drink at some bars nearby and then they will text you when your table is ready.\n\nThe decor is really nice, intimate, and comfortable - they have beautiful flower arrangements.  The menu here is prix fixe so you pay $35 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  You can add an additional pasta dish for $10 more.  For each course, they give you two options to select from.  I was a little worried about this -- but honestly the food is good, even if it's something out of your comfort zone -- give it a shot.  Also note, they only serve beer and wine.\n\nMy friend and I each ordered opposite entrees and shared everything - that way we'd be able to try everything on the menu.  We also added the pasta dishes too.  You definitely get the most for your money here - the food is delicious, well made, unique/interesting, and the portions are definitely enough -- we were so full and even had leftovers.  Be aware that the menu changes daily - and the menu online may be different from what they actually have.\n\nOne of my favorites was the \"Sunchoke Soup.\"  What the heck is that you might ask? (which I did haha)  Apparently it's the root of a sunflower -- sounds weird right?  -- it was delicious!  I was absolutely obsessed with it!  It also had pine nuts in it -- such a unique soup that I'd never had before.  Absolutely loved it.  \n\nMy second favorite was the dessert I ordered -- the \"Butternut Squash Tartlet.\"  This was plated so beautifully and tasted almost like \"thanksgiving.\"  I loved the spiced ricotta served with it and the pine nut butter.\n\nThe only criticisms I have is that the proteins were cooked perfectly, but I wished they had more flavor.  The sauces on the plate were good but there wasn't enough.  I also found myself wishing there was more protein in the pasta dishes.  The \"rock shrimp pasta\" didn't really have any shrimp to the visible eye.  \n\nOverall, this place is definitely worth a visit.  I think it was the experience itself that won me over.

It is a great deal - $35 for a 3 course prix fixe menu ($10 supplement for an extra pasta course) at a Michelin-recommended restaurant.\n\nWe came here at 5:30pm on a Sat (when they opened), and the restaurant filled up soon after. There aren't too many tables so it is an intimate space. The lighting is fairly dark as well, so it is nice for a romantic date. Service was fast and friendly. \n\nBetween the two of us, we decided to order everything on the menu and to split all 8 dishes. We had the following:\n\nAppetizers:\nKale Caesar salad: as a devout carnivore, I typically dislike salads, but this one actually tasted really good. It wasn't overdressed but was seasoned very well, so that the kale almost tasted savory and smoky. The garlic croutons and shaved Parmesan also helped add some umami to the dish.\nFennel apple soup: a very smooth, rich, creamy soup that had a very refreshing tartness from the apple chunks and the lemon creme fraische.  \n\nPastas:\nUni risotto: the risotto was very creamy and delicious, and paired well with the tender rock shrimp in top. I really liked the hints of lemon as well.\nBraised pork garganelli: my favorite dish of the night! The pork was super moist and tender and the pasta was perfectly cooked.\n\nEntrees:\nCrispy skin striped bass: unfortunately the entrees were not as strong as the appetizers or pastas. The bass was tender but a bit unevenly seasoned. I did really like the lentils with bacon, though. \nRoasted pork loin: the pork was quite good but I think a bit overdone, so some parts were slightly tough. \n\nDesserts:\nEton mess: I think I enjoyed this dish the least. It had several meringues in a huckleberry sauce with chestnuts. I didn't feel like it had much substance or flavor, and probably would not order this again.\nChocolate cream tart: this was the better dessert and quite good, but didn't wow me. \n\nTl;dr: a very good prix fixe deal with great quality food for a low price of $35 for 3 courses.

It's usually booked solid, but as long as you have reservations, everything runs smoothly and on time. \n\nFrom the moment we entered the restaurant, we were treated like royalty. As I glanced around the place and saw smiles on my fellow diners' faces, I could tell this place was gonna be good. \n\nOur server, Lucas, was friendly and extremely helpful- steering us in the right direction whenever we couldn't make up our minds and answering our questions about the menu. \n\nWe ordered 2 4-course meals with different but equally good counterparts. \n\nThe first course was a persimmon salad with toasted almonds, pomegranate and queso fresco lightly dancing around it. I was delighted to see persimmon on the menu and how none of the other ingredients were respectful to not steal its thunder. \n\nThe next soup was something completely new to me: Sunchoke Soup- made from the root of sunflowers! The broth was thick and creamy like a cream of mushroom soup with pine nuts and pickled sunchokes that tasted something like crunchy green apples with a nutty aftertaste. \n\nNext came our cheesy carbs. Emphasis on cheeeeesey. Rock Shrimp Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potato Risotto w Chorizo. Soft, buttery, and delicious. You couldn't really see the protein- it was so minimal it could have passed for a vegetarian dish if you didn't already know it wasn't. \n\nOur main course was a crispy skin striped bass and a pork loin. Both cooked to perfection. They were very lightly seasoned so you could just appreciate the fine texture of the meat, not dry at all, and required very little chewing. \n\nThe dessert was wonderful and I feel like it made our dinner literally end on a high note of flavors, expectations, and discovery.\n\nThe chocolate roulade cake looked like a simple chocolate loaf. I was worried it might be dry and underwhelming. However, there were layers of chocolate sponge and thick chocolate with hints of orange. There was a little jelly on the dish that made an excellent addition to a perfect bite that combined chocolate and citrus in a delightful way.\n\nThe last dessert was a whole culinary experience in itself. It was a butternut squash tartlet which tasted like the beauty of autumn and all its flavors. \nWe then noticed a strange sliver used as garnish on top. Lucas came over and explained that it was from a Buddha Hand (I'd never heard of it either). He was nice enough to bring one out for us to look at and explained a little more about this fascinating citrus fruit that looked like a mutant lemon. It was pretty cool. \n\nI would definitely come back here as their menu changes daily and we had a pleasant, memorable experience.

The salad and the soup was very delicious. The salmon was great, but I didn't care too much for the meat dish since I rarely eat meat. The desserts were good as well. Seriously for ~$10/ea dish it's honestly a steal. \n\nLoved the ambiance of the restaurant.

I've had this place bookmarked for awhile, and all it took was a spontaneous date night with my boyfriend to finally make reservations here. Surprisingly there was availability on a Sunday night, as small as this place is. But you should REALLY make reservations instead of walking in. I think we just got lucky. Anyways, we arrived and were immediately seated in the back. Cute woodsy and candlelight ambiance. Perfect for a romantic but casual date night. \n\nThe service was fantastic, as was the presentation of food. There's a $35 prix fixe menu of the evening, saving us from the most daunting and time-consuming part of dinner... deciding what to eat. Everything was delicious... the soup, meat, and dessert. Good variety of tastes and textures. I can't exactly recall WHAT we ate that night, despite the photos I took, but if you scroll through all the photos on Yelp, everything is absolutely gorgeous. Almost too good-looking to eat!\n\nI would highly recommend bookmarking Trestle if you haven't been here yet. Even if you have, the fact that their menu changes and their service remains stellar is a good reason to come back and experience more of what the amazing chefs serve up. Plus, if you come with a +1 you can easily try all the options on the prix fixe menu.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

The skin was really crisped perfectly and was super flavorful. And, the lobster pappardelle was amazing! Perfectly cooked pasta and well-seasoned.\n\nService was exceptional both before our reservation and throughout the night. It was really easy to call and make reservations and they were super attentive throughout the night. My only complaint is that there is literally no waiting area because it's such a small restaurant. So, if you arrive early for your table or if you have to wait at all, it's rather awkward because you'll be standing in a tiny little corner blocking the entrance/exit to the restaurant.

Basically anyone you are trying to impress without breaking the bank. \n\nA cozy spot in the edge of Chinatown and Fidi, it has industrial chic decor and sports some giant green bouquet throughout. \n\nTheir menu changes every week, so I won't review the dishes, rather I will review the ability of the chef. The preparation and presentation of food is perfect. The chef paid a lot of attention to select ingredients that compliment and balance each other, with some interesting ingredients and flavor profile. It is well executed classically crowd pleasing dishes with a twist. For example, the mushroom risotto has an exotic blend of mushrooms baked into chips and sprinkled on top with some herbs and spices. The result is a wonderfully creamy risotto with a delightful texture and refreshing flavor. Wow. \n\nFor 2 tasting menu with a pasta add-on course, it came to be about $100 after taxes and tip.

The service was stellar. Every single person was pleasant, professional, and efficient. Even our water glasses were never empty.\n\nTheir menu is a three-course prix fixe meal that changes nightly. You select between two options for each course - appetizer, main, and dessert. You may add a pasta for an additional $10. Since there were four of us, we followed our waiter's suggestion and ordered both pastas and shared so we got to taste both. \n\nOur appetizer selections were Beans and Charred Peppers or Squash Soup. The soup was good, but all four of us agreed that the beans with peppers was even better. The combination of ingredients sounded unspectacular, but in actuality it was very tasty, refreshing, and delicious. \n\nThe pastas that night were Beef Curry Gnocchi and Thai Style Pasta. The Thai pasta we thought was the only unsuccessful dish of the evening. The sauce was too thick and not enough \"Thai\" flavor. \n\nThe Black Cod and Duck Leg Confit mains were both delicious. The duck leg was perfectly prepared, and all the components on the plate complemented each other very well. It was wonderful! \n\nBoth desserts were also very good, my favorite being the Pear Crostata over the Chocolate Budino.\n\nIf I were allowed partial stars, I would give Trestle 4.8 stars. I am knocking off partial stars for the Thai pasta and because it is a bit noisy. I love it when the ingredients of a dish surprise me and the whole adds up to more than the sum of the individual ingredients. This is what happened at Trestle (except for the Thai pasta - sorry).

Only issue was that they include the SF Health mandate in the final total on your bill, which changes what the tip amounts actually should be.

Pork was a bit dry but flavor was there.\n- Carrot Risotto: delicious with a kick of spice. I love the pine nuts too. It is sweet because of the carrot sauce.\n- Eggplant pappardelle: this was also yummy with the eggplant that was not its usual mushiness. Flavor was good, would definitely reorder.\n- New York strip steak: nothing unique but was cooked perfectly medium rare just like i like it. A solid dish.\n- Jasmine mousse: interesting floral taste and texture of a hard cheesecake.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-04", "description": "The hubby's 25th birthday is most certainly a special occasion and after going though a multitude of options of where to take him, I decided to make reservations at Trestle for a Saturday evening.\n\nLuckily, the horrendous parking situation of SF didn't cast too dark of a shadow on our bright day, thanks to a parking garage literally right next to the restaurant that charged $2.00 for every 30 minutes on the weekend. When we walked inside the eatery, we were surprised to see a little card on the table, wishing my hubby a sweet birthday and signed by the staff. Already, that was a very nice touch.\n\nI will say that in terms of space, Trestle is a SUPER tight fit. Tables are UNCOMFORTABLY close together--so close, that you not only hear every word coming out of the mouth of the person sitting next to you, but tables had to also be pushed aside in order for patrons to get in and out. It's definitely not a place for an intimate date or for those who need elbow room.\n\nBut the decor is nice and clean, and the servers were all very helpful. We really didn't have one person wait on us the entire night, but there was always someone there when we had a request. We especially liked how our silverware was promptly replaced after every course, making for an easy transition. \n\nTrestle is famous for its fixed three-course meal at $35 per person (an additional $10 if you want to have the extra pasta course). Because the hubby and I had a late lunch, we opted out of the pasta course and went with the usual pre-set menu, ordering both dishes from every category. For our visit, we had squash soup and fruit salad for appetizers, crispy sea bass and braised short rib for the main course, and a lemon pudding and chocolate angel chiffon cake for dessert.\n\nThe ones that stood out the most for us were the squash soup, the short rib, and the crispy sea bass. The squash soup was delicately poured into the ceramic bowl at our table and dressed with Isaraeli couscous. I loved how the soup was decadent, but not the least bit heavy. The couscous added a fun element with its delightful crunch. The hubby greatly enjoyed the short rib, noting the tenderness of the meat and how it wasn't drowning in a sauce. He also liked the pickled cabbage and radish that added freshness to the dish. I, on the other hand, preferred the sea bass that had the most deliciously crispy skin. Just from cutting into it, I could hear the crackle of the skin breaking and it paired perfectly with the tomato base sauce that had asparagus and sausage. Amazing! \n\nWhile the other dishes weren't necessarily bad, they did fail in some aspects, such as the angel chiffon cake that was a bit dense and the fruit salad was dressed with too much feta cheese. We had also asked for a serving of the firehouse bread with salt and pepper butter, and while we enjoyed the butter, the bread was over-toasted. In terms of dessert, the hubby wasn't too fond of the lemon pudding, but I personally loved the tartness of the pudding and the sweetness of the pastry crumbs. It was almost like a deconstructed lemon pie.\n\nEven with all those hiccups, Trestle still managed to impress us. The quality of the ingredients and the beautifully presented dishes served as proof of how much thought and care Trestle puts into its food. \n\nNothing can beat an amazing dinner to end a birthday celebration and from the way the hubby hugged me as we walked out of the restaurant, I'm proud to say Trestle made it a success. Definitely worth every penny!", "author": "Quyen L."}

For the first course I got the popcorn shrimp salad, which to be honest was a bit random, but I didn't hate it.  There was a good balance of spice with the pickled pepper, and cooling with the dressing.  The second dish I got was the Trout with crispy skin, which was pretty standard, nothing to complain or rave about.  The best part of the meal was definitely the dessert which was some kind of chocolate mousse; it had a good balance of textures, and flavors with the walnuts, micro greens, ice cream and of course the chocolate mousse!\n\nOverall the meal was good, and they also have a wide variety of wines and beers or you can BOYB.

The food is amazing too? Am I dreaming?!\n\nWe had the heirloom salad. Probably the top 3 salads I have ever had. Tomatoes so fresh. Crispy Quinoa to make it crunchy. Incredible. Salad add-ons: Mushroom risotto and lamb garganelli. Both were incredible and a good healthy portion. Still can't believe it was $10 for each of them. Oh the mushroom risotto! My favorite dish I had there. There wasn't one mediocre thing we ate there. So it was definitely hard to pick a favorite among many favorites. Entrees were the trout and pork loin and both were perfectly done. And an almond custard for dessert that was simply heavenly as well as a chocolate tart. I love that I did not have to mull over a long complicated menu trying to decide what to get. Two options under each category.\n\nThe wine was amazing too-- $10 for a glass of their Nero d'Avola Le Casematte wine from Sicily, Italy.  $50 for an incredible four course fine dining experience?!

I chose the squash soup. The soup included couscous, mint yogurt, and zucchini croutons. What was cool about the soup was that they pouted the cream base into the other ingredients which were already in the bowl. They did this right at your table. You could then mix the soup yourself.  \n\nToday the optional $10 pasta course was shrimp & grits or arugula pesto bucatini. We chose to share the bucatini because we already had had shrimp & grits earlier in the day. It was made with toasted walnut, preserved lemon, and pecorino. The pasta tasted okay. \n\nFor the main course, the choice was between Crispy Skin-Striped Bass and Braised Beef Short Rib. I chose the Bass. It came in a Saffron broth with pole bean, chorizo, and mushrooms. I thought that the Saffron broth did nothing to add to the taste of the fish. I really liked the crispy skin and the little things that were in the broth though. \n\nThe dessert choices were  Lemon steam pudding and Chocolate Angel Food Cake. The cake included candied pine nut, nectarines curls, and buttermilk cream. The cake was very visually appealing. It was light tasting, and I would have preferred it to have been more sweet. \n\nWhile the food was good,  nothing stood out as being really exceptional. The courses were visually appealing and included a lot of neat ingredients, but were lacking in taste. \n\nThe service was exemplary with the staff constantly refilling glasses.\u00a0 They thoroughly explained each course and were friendly.

Salad was good and refreshing with a WOOP of bacon here and there. I really liked the cauliflower soup, it was smooth and had pieces of steamed cauliflower and caviar which made it more exciting. We decided to add the pasta course for another $10. I did not think this was worth it. The chestnut risotto was not bad, I quite enjoyed that, however the pink peppercorn garganelli was not satisfying at all. I had the salmon dish for entree since I do not like lamb. The salmon was pretty good, I really liked the mushroom and grits underneath. Was really impressed with the pumpkin cake and the kumquat. Usually kumquat is super sour and I like it on it's own but somehow mixing it with sweet pumpkin cake gave it another kick. \nAll in all, for what you expect of fine dining, the taste of the food wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad.

The small portions are expected, however I felt as if something was missing in the 3 course menu. I have to say though, the dessert was spectacular. Now THAT is something I won't forget. Was it worth the price? Yeah, I'd say it is reasonable. Perfect for a date!", "author": "Ashley H."}

You also have the option of adding a 4th course for only $10. Their menu changes on a daily basis based on what's in season and what ingredients are available, definitely a reason to keep me coming back!\n\nSince their menu changes regularly, you likely will not get the same food I am reviewing. It's April and the spring season had just started, our meals had a very zesty, citrusy theme that awakened my taste buds, an indication that they use seasonal ingredients. \n\nGrilled Asparagus Salad - Lemon Streusel, Quail Egg, Grapefruit Hollandaise - crunchy asparagus served with a tiny poached quail egg! So creamy, citrusy and a great opener.\n\nEnglish Pea Risotto - Grand Padano, Arugula, Crispy Prosciutto - The color was very enticing. I loved the lemony taste of this dish as well.\n\nCrispy-Skin Mt. Lassen Trout - Potato Fondant, Caviar, Pickled Red Onion - Classic, simple, yet delicious! Perfectly cooked trout, fresh fish, and I got to eat caviar!

I had bookmarked it ahead of time and knew the menu would be a three course prix fixe style with optional pasta. \n\nMy mom and I both had the burrata salad to start - full of fresh greens and more than just your average handmade burrata dish - tres bien! I loved the grit of the pepper to juxtapose the creamy cheese.\n\nI ordered the bass and mom had the short rib for the main course. We ordered the bucatini pasta and found the delicate but full flavor of the bucatini to round out the meal quite well. The bass was cooked to perfection and I ate every bit of it - rare for me as I usually avoid fishy parts of seafood. It was perfectly perched atop purple rice and sugar snap peas, creating a colorful masterpiece.\n\nFor dessert I had the panna cotta - no decision-making needed there! It was a little on the sweet side, but the texture was perfect. Mom ordered the other option, a chocolate crunch concoction with marshmallows and cookie dough - again, perfectly meshing different textures and flavors - that came with ice cream. She and I were impressed overall and left feeling very satiated after our relaxed 2 hour meal. The menu here changes frequently, so call ahead if you want to know what is available.

A high-quality 3 course meal for $35 a person is unheard of in San Francisco, but Trestle makes this dream a reality.\n\nReasons why Trestle is so awesome:\n1. As mentioned, it's 3 courses for $35, with your pick between two different options for every course. You can also add a pasta supplement to make it 4 courses for $45 if you'd like (highly recommend!). Such a deal in San Francisco for the amount of money you're paying.\n2. The options per course are quite different, so unless you're insanely picky, you can probably pick out something you'll love. Or even better, go with one other person, and you can try everything on the menu, which is a huge variety.\n3. Their prix fixe menu changes daily depending on seasonality and what's fresh. You could come here nearly everyday and not get bored. That takes some serious talent (and balls) to pull off, and that's something I really appreciate.\n4. Literally everything is delicious. Of course some dishes stand out more than others, but seriously, every bite is great.\n\nOn the particular night that I went, some highlights included tomato soup with avocado and crispy paprika quinoa, lamb bucatini with olives, crispy skin trout with a hazelnut romesco sauce, and the most amazing chocolate pot de creme I've ever had.\n\nCan't wait to go back because I definitely will.", "author": "Sara L."}

It had a small, clean, and intimate setting. The low lighting made it feel inviting and romantic. You can definitely hear indistinct chattering amongst the other groups as it echos so you kind of have to talk loudly. It is located at Jackson Square and I believe it only seats 49. Beautifully decorated. \n\nFOOD: I believe the Prix Fix menu changes daily - which allow creativity to shine through from the kitchen and gives you more reasons to keep coming back! I have to be honest, I was very surprised to hear that their 3 course prix fixe menu was only $35 considering it is Michelin Star quality experience, but I am not complaining either. Every bite was delightful and the presentation of each dish was a work of art. I think it is more than just a place to eat, it is an experience you have to try for yourself. \nOur meal for Friday, March 10, 2016 (shared between two: see photos): Salmon Croquette, Sunchoke Bisque, Clam Tagliatelle, Mushroom Risotto, Roasted Prime New York, Crispy-skin Salmon, Chocolate Diablo Cake, and Lime Cacherin \n\nSERVICE: The service was exceptional. I would highly recommend making reservations, especially for groups. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. They explain what each course is as it is brought out to you. We came to celebrate a birthday and even brought a cake (hindsight: not a good idea as you'll already be stuffed by the time they serve the cake).

Yes please!\n\nTrestle is located on the corner of Jackson and Columbus, and you might really miss it because it's very low-profile. We almost missed the restaurant because we were looking at eye-level for signage, but finally saw the giant lighted sign up above XD\n\nUpon walking in, I was a bit surprised that the restaurant was very small. It looks like it seats maybe 40 max and most tables are 4 toppers. You will hear your neighbors' conversations, and they will hear you :PThere is barely any standing room inside if you're waiting to be seated, BUT they're very fast at getting you seated. They've got their timing down pat -- The pair ahead of me got seated when they walked in, and our table was being cleaned and set up at the same time. \n\nThe service is great, with only one hostess and 2 servers. They're really on top of clearing your table when you finish a course, filling your water bottle and cups of water, folding napkins if you get up to use the bathroom -- all of it! They change the utensils with every course, which is really nice but at the same time feels a bit wasteful =/ If you come in, do expect a bit of a wait to be seated if the hostess is busy. But it's not bad, like 5-10 minutes. \n\nAppetizer:\n- Smoked Salmon Salad: I order this and really enjoyed it! The salad was light and refreshing, but a bit salty. The salmon came blended like tuna salad vs. sliced, but that was kind of nice. I think that way it's easier to get some salmon in every bite. \n- Vegetable Minestrone: The boyfriend ordered this and it was a very hearty and creamy soup. It's not clear as I thought minestrone would be. They bring it out with veggies on the side, and then the server pours out the soup into the bowl.\n\nPasta:\nWe got one to share since we weren't super duper hungry.\n- Meyer Lemon Garagnelli: SO GOOD, I wold definitely recommend adding on a pasta to share. The pasta had a lovely hint of citrus rather than the lemon being all up in your face. The citrus was perfect with the cheesiness of the Parmesan. The portion was small but good for $10 and as an add-on.\n- Sea Urchin Risotto: This was the other option and it sounded a bit too rich (plus the boyfriend isn't a huge uni fan :P)\n\nMain: \n- Crispy-Skin Snapper: This came perfectly seared or grilled or baked or whatever they did to it. The dashi broth was super flavorful (salty on its own) and was great with the fish since it wasn't heavily seasoned. The dish also came with pickled radish, one stem of bok choy (lol) and some bits of mushroom.\n- Truffle-Stuffed Chicken: This was the other option, but we were both meh about it. \n\nDessert:\nDisclaimer - I'm not a huge dessert fan. The bf loves sweets, but isn't a huge fan of American desserts.\nS'mores Bar - For both of us, this was okay. The marshmallow was very fluffy though!\nLemon Tea Cake - I enjoyed this, but it's not something I'd care to order/eat again in the future. The cake was dense but not in a bad way, and overall it was a nice way to end a meal. The only lemon part was the tiny dollops of cream on the side. The Early Grey chiboust was my favorite part of this dish.\n\nWe had a great dinner at Trestle and would recommend it to others looking for a cute date night/dinner spot that won't necessarily break the bank.

But wow, Trestle really delivered! For $35 and a 3-course pre-fixe menu (+$10 additional pasta course), it was well worth it.\n\nRESERVATIONS - Highly recommend making a reservation in advance via OpenTable. The restaurant itself is fairly small and tables are tight. You'll be able to hear your neighbors conversations--keep that in mind if you're planning to bring a date.\n\nFOOD - The s/o and I ordered alternating options on the menu, but both chose the snapper for our main.\n\n-Appetizers: Smoked Salmon Salad & Vegetable Minestrone\nThe smoked salmon was pureed and had a very similar flavor profile to the trout dip at State Bird Provisions. The vegetable minestrone was deliciously creamy with small bites of veggies all throughout.\n\n-Pastas: Meyer Lemon Garagnelli & Sea Urchin Risotto\nThe garagnelli was served in an extremely small portion and was very basic in flavor--I would pass on this. The risotto, on the other hand, was perfect. It was served with clams on top and was nice and rich--definitely worth ordering.\n\n-Main course: Crispy-skin Snapper\nThis came out and smelled extremely fishy. Once we started eating, however, it was very flavorful and light. The skin was actually very crispy! But overall, was probably my least favorite dish of the night.\n\n-Desserts: S'mores Bar & Lemon Tea Cake\nIf you're into chocolate, the s'mores bar is for you. It's served with dollops of passion fruit to complement the richness of the chocolate. The lemon tea cake is extremely fragrant, but I loved it! The earl grey chiboust was delicious--wish I could order an entire bowl of this!\n\nCOST - For a 2-person pre-fixe dinner + 2 pastas, the total came out around $100 after tax and the SF mandate cost. Not bad considering we were pretty full. They also bring your check out in a little booklet, where you can write down a silly/memorable note for the next diners to see.\n\nSERVICE - Servers here are friendly and attentive. They'll come by fairly often to top off your water. \n\nCONS - You must explicitly ASK for their bread. TBH, I feel like they should offer this to every table. They serve Firebrand bread, toasted with butter and also included a healthy dollop of whipped butter with salt flakes & pepper--SO good! \n\nAlso not sure if they have vegetarian friendly options, as I only saw fish + chicken as the main--something to keep in mind if you have any dietary restrictions. \n\nLastly, there was a fairly long delay between our pasta dish and our main course. It was especially noticeable since our food came out consistently beforehand. Not sure what happened here.\n\nOverall - I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Trestle. Apparently they switch around their menu every week or so. Will definitely be back to try more dishes!", "author": "Shirley H."}

We ended up adding $10 to our meal for the chance to try the clam pasta with uni butter. Menu changes daily.\n\nThe place was small, cozy, clean, and full. It was hard to hear conversations at times. I'd go back if I ever visit San Fran again. Probably not a place to go to if pressed for time, even though service was timely. I feel this experience should not be rushed. There was no wasted food and all our plates left the table licked clean. :)\n\nSunchoke bisque of golden raisins, toasted pine nuts, and pickled sunchoke: creamy smooth, really liked the pickled sunchoke because it was interesting. However, i would have personally enjoyed pepper or more spice to the bisque. Otherwise you have to ensure you get the other ingredients to not end up with a bite that's left wanting.\n\nClam tagliatelle with uni butter, lemon segments, and chervil: noodles were great but I was somewhat disappointed because I couldn't figure out where the uni was.

Not your usual Greek salad. Had a lot of radicchio, not sure if there was any dressing.

However, the soup was way too salty.\n\nMain:\nCrispy Skin Mt. Lassen Trout - by far the best plate of the evening. The skin was crispy and delicious. The fish was a good temperature and the accompanying vegetables were crisp and tasty.\n\nRoasted Pork Loin - two small wedges of overcooked pork. The portion of pork should have been doubled. If I weren't sharing the trout with my friend, I would be pretty bummed at the tiny portion of this dish.\n\nDessert:\nZeppole - you get three small balls of Zeppole.

It was tasty generally.\n\nOverall, it was kind of hit or miss on each course. The desserts were solid.

Almost like Restaurant Week, except the food quality doesn't suck \n\nVenue: Came here on a date Tuesday night with a 7:15pm reservation.  Given it was prime dinnertime, it was pretty busy and a bit louder than I expected.  The inside is rather cozy, but the tables were a bit close to each other to the point that it was hard to put our work bags anywhere without blocking traffic.  Luckily we came in when there was a bit of light, because otherwise it is a bit dark inside.\n\nService: fairly quick, given we are near FiDi, but not too pushy or rushing.  \n\nFood: $35/person for 3 courses, $10 extra if you also do a pasta course ($45 total).  There are two options for each course and the menu changes daily.  The food below was for 7/25/17...\n-- Tomato Salad (basil puree, roasted shishito, crispy quinoa) - tomatoes were ok, but I preferred the roasted shishito peppers over the tomatoes (which probably isn't a good thing); thank god I didn't have any spicy shishito though!  Loved the little bit of quinoa to give the dish a little bit of crunch.\n-- Also tasted the Sweet Corn Soup (cornbread crouton, chipotle aioli, queso fresco) - I was surprised at how it was very flavorful without being too creamy (which would cause lactose intolerant people like me to avoid these types of soups).  Chipotle gave a little kick to the dish but wasn't overwhelming.  \n-- Saffron Risotto (rock shrimp & mussels, chorizo, paprika) - ours was well cooked, which is always a plus!  Proteins were well cooked, though by default you could taste the chorizo more than the shrimp and mussels, but still worth the extra $10.  \n-- Crispy-Skin Striped Bass (pickled grapes, roasted cauliflower, brown butter vinaigrette) - my bass was cooked really well and I love when the skin is crisped up.  Well seasoned too!  The vinaigrette was a nice touch to the fish and the roasted cauliflower was cooked nicely as well, though the pickled grapes were a bit too sour for my taste.  \n-- Vanilla Vacherin (tarragon cream, canary melon, olive oil cake) - the highlight of my meal!  The dense olive oil cake was a great contrast to the meringue and light melon and overall ended the meal on a light note (vs. the black forest cake, which caused my date to pass out afterwards).\n\nDecent spot for if you want a Restaurant Week format but for better food for the price you pay!  If you want to treat someone out but don't want to blow a budget or go too fancy, try Trestle.", "author": "Audrey H."}

I would say they rate just below a Michelin star, although I've been to places with a star that weren't as good. Great prices for the quality of food and service. I like how the staff is attentive but not annoying. They let you eat and don't try to up-sell you or take 20 minutes to describe the menu. I never felt rushed. Ambiance and decor are also good.\n\nMy favorite thing is how easy it is to get a reservation and despite the prix fixe menu, they will accommodate vegetarians.\n\nDon't come here expecting a mind-blowing meal if you are an experienced diner.

Upon being seated, I received a nice handwritten welcoming birthday card from the staff. Very nice gesture. The appetizer, main course and dessert I had was delicious. My party ended up having trouble finishing all the food. They allowed us to sample the wines that they offered by the glass which was very nice of them. We ended up ordering 2 bottles of wine, and even though we ended up being the last party to leave, they did not rush us and we finished both bottles of wine.

Trestle is also known to be Stone Throw's sister restaurant so what a steal! But unfortunately, I think my friends and fellow Yelp reviewers hyped it up too much for me and was a bit disappointed with the cuisine.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was probably the supplement: Garganelle Bolognese. This was actually r.e.a.l.l.y. good. Skip out on the Squid Ink Conchiglie as it was just mediocre and also better made at Stone Throw. Was a bit too chewy and a bit too flavorless for my liking.\n\nThe food wasn't bad nor was it amazing; to be honest, the supplement pasta dish was actually my favorite. But if you add the supplement, then it's technically $45 for your dinner... then add a drink and your meal can easily come out to $110+ for 2 people. If that's the case, then is the price actually a good deal? Debatable... but I'd still try it for the experience.

Their carrot soup and kale salad were both good. The squid ink risotto was good but I was disappointed with the small quantity of the other pasta. Check out the pics... a pasta side for 10 dollars with only three spoons full. The low light of the meal was the chewy lamb entree. Three of us has ordered it and none could finish.

As one of the first groups in we were able to snag a corner table which had slightly more room. Trestle's tables are packed so tightly that the waiters have to move them to allow guests to sit. The decor is beautifully cohesive, from the original brick wall to the faux architectural elements to the art and even the flower arrangement.\n\nThe water was ice cold. I ordered a powerful 10% ABV Brasserie Rochefort. My husband and I selected different options so we could try each dish on the prix fix menu. We added a single cacio e pepe bucatini.\n\nThe black bean soup starter was smooth, with subdued flavors. I like how the soup liquid was poured over the other ingredients so that the textures and flavors remained distinct. The salad of chicory and burrata also had a mild flavor profile, but might have been zestier with more dressing.\n\nThe luscious cacio e pepe was outstanding. We quickly devoured it. Given another chance, I'll order individual servings.\n\nEntr\u00e9es were small, especially the diminutive chicken breast. But it worked well with the peach mostarda and spinach. The trout was perfectly executed with a crispy golden skin. White beans added needed substance to the petite portion.\n\nThe dessert of custard with watermelon g\u00e9lee was creative but not a winning combination. The four cubes of carrot cake with chocolate cream cheese frosting and pickled carrots was a trainwreck. Chocolate obscured any carrot flavor and the sour carrot ribbons were exactly as out of place as you'd expect.\n\n$35 wasn't as great a deal as it first seemed, given the smallish entr\u00e9es and dessert. \u00c0 la carte, I'd price the apps at $8, the entr\u00e9es $18 (at most), and desserts $8.

One thing I liked is that they kept giving new utensils and plates for each course. I really enjoyed that. But one thing I didn't like was the wait for the food. I think each course we waited about 5-10 minutes with empty plates before anything arrived. I'm not sure if that was the leisurely feel, etc. If you were on an awkward date this would be a nightmare but if you have great company sure why not!?

You can check online on their website to see the courses.  \n\nI came here on a Monday night after making reservations the night before. Parking was fairly easy, as there are a ton of metered spots within the vicinity of the restaurant.  Here is where my rating is on the fence between a 3 or 4.  As we walked in, we were taken back as to how tiny the place actually is.  This place is so small in fact, that there is no waiting area or reception area.  We walked in confused, and did not know where to go.  No one greeted us, so I even walked towards the back where the restroom is.  After walking back to the front entrance, a worker noticed us.  We were seated in a corner, which in my opinion had the most privacy in the entire restaurant.  \n\nOur server then presented us with menus.  We decided on the salmon croquette and tortilla soup for appetizers.  Next were the risotto and lobster pasta.  For the main course, we had the chicken.  Lastly, dessert featured thai tea semifreddo, and milk chocolate mousse. \n\nThe salmon croquette was very tasty.  The quail egg on top definitely helped add that extra level of finesse to the dish.  I could have done without all that salad used as a filler for the dish.  Maybe there could have been another salmon croquette instead.  The tortilla soup was good, but it was a tad plain and repetitive.  \n\nThe risotto and lobster pasta were the stars of the meal.  The risotto was hot and fresh out of the kitchen.  I enjoyed all the ingredients and felt they added complexity towards the dish.  The lobster pasta was rich and creamy, and just tasted great overall.  \n\nThe chicken was good, but I wish there were mashed potatoes or something of substance that came with the dish.  In a way, it was underwhelming because I expected more. \n\nDessert boasted a nice effort on plating.  I enjoyed the mousse more than the thai tea because I'm not a fan of thai tea to begin with.  The ingredients fared well together though.  There was a nice contrast between tart and sweet.  \n\nThe main reason why the 3 star rating comes down to the service.  My mindset going in was that this place was going to be a fine dining type experience.  Yet, they did not ask us how everything tasted after they took away each course.  No one walked around and refilled my water or even asked if I wanted more even though there was none in my glass.  I also wish they would have asked us if we wanted bread instead of forcing us to ask for some.  It would have been a kind gesture if they wanted around table to table with bread in hand, offering it.  The bread and butter was super delicious, and I wish they brought it out first.  Instead, they brought it to us at the same time as the appetizers.  I also wished I had asked for more because there were only two tiny pieces of bread.  \n\nIn conclusion, I would come back if I liked all the courses that were being offered for that particular day.  The cost is a great bargain for a nice dinner.  I hope I can give this place a higher rating next time.", "author": "Victor L."}

Our table was so close to the couple next to us that we felt that we were basically on their date and them on ours.  It caused us to not feel comfortable to say certain things because of the lack of privacy.

While not going overboard on fine dining and enjoying a contemporary meal that exudes the chicness of dining out, Trestle marks the spot!\n\nIt is a simple and straightforward menu with their renowned 3 course prixe fixe meal.  I am impressed with their prixe fixe for $35 and do add on a choice of pasta (opted risotto), for an additional $10.  The risotto was cooked on point and complimented well with my glass of Barbera red wine for the evening.  The presentation was admirable for each dish and the pour by our waiter on the corn soup, added a lovely touch to the entire dining.  The truffle stuffed chicken was tender, flavorful and was a filler.  \n\nThe colors popped for each dish - especially their desserts.  The Huckleberry coffee cake was my favorite.  The ice cream paired well with the cake that reminded me of a mini, bite-sized blueberry muffin. \n\nI do recommend bringing a plus one as seats are very limited (it is a cozy, tightly-knit place) and the menu only offers 2 choices for each course.  What makes this also wonderful is that they change their dishes up so it won't get boring to come here again with the same plates to try. \n\nEven though I know it isn't a word, I'm going to use it as a form of expression and feeling.

The restaurant is small, and the ambiance is cool, dark, and romantic. The way that the menu works is it's a prix fixe menu- for $35 you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For an extra $10, you can get another pasta course as well! Every night there are two options for each course, so we each got different things for each course and got to try the whole menu! Also, pro tip ask for the bread right when you're seated- they won't bring it out unless you ask for it, and it takes a minute for them to toast it up fresh! For the appetizers, we had the calamari salad and the leek soup. The salad wasn't bad, but that soup was awesome! It was silky and creamy, and it was topped with these little potatoes that had a nice char on them. For the entrees, we got the NY strip steak and the salmon. Both were great, but I preferred the salmon! For he pasta course, we got the mushroom risotto and the Cacio e pepe- the risotto was definitely the winner! There were crispy and chewy bits of mushroom, and the rice was cooked just perfectly! Finally got our dessert, we got the chocolate cake and the pineapple cake. They were definitely different flavors, but both great! To make the meal even better, we brought a bottle of wine with us because the corkage fee is only $25!

I loved everything about it, but the pasta (Uni Bugatini) and the dessert (Chocolate Cake Sundae) were definitely the most memorable. Service was on point and super friendly.

Sounds too good to be true, but Trestle really delivered top notch quality. You can add a pasta course for only $10 more- just do it! Our group of 4 ordered 2 pastas to share, which was plenty.  \n\nThe space was rustic and inviting, which was nice because we were there for hours. The service was appropriately attentive, but each course took a long time to arrive, even the complimentary bread (ASK FOR THIS!). I appreciate that our water glasses were almost always full. When J's glass was empty for a few moments, our server practically DASHED toward him to refill it. \n\nMy first bite of food, the sunchoke bisque, already blew me away. The menu changes frequently, so sadly, I doubt I'll ever get to eat this again. I sampled J's salmon croquette, which was just okay; I think I picked the right dish for me. The uni clam linguine and mushroom risotto were both cooked to al dente perfection. By the time my steak arrived, I was pretty stuffed, but I knew it would be a shame to take it home and microwave it as a leftover, so I powered through it. The portion was tiny anyway, maybe 2-3 oz. of meat. \n\nMy dessert was a lime meringue, which I did NOT know I was getting, because the menu used some other boujee word to describe it. I don't like meringue, so I absolutely would've picked the other option if I'd known. The cake chunks were dry, and the whole thing had so many elements that never came together for me. C barely touched his diablo chocolate cake, which I also wasn't impressed by. I hate wasting food, but it wasn't worth the calories. Dessert is the climax of my meal, so I was really disappointed. All that foreplay led to a whole lotta nothing.\n\nThe party next to us was celebrating a birthday, but despite our enthusiastic singing and shameless attempts to chat them up, they did not offer us a slice of the enormous cake they brought in. \n\nThe overall experience was still pleasant, until I started feeling queasy hours later. I texted my friends to see what's up. \"I have a tummy ache. :( Just me?\" \n\nA: Aww no! I felt a little off for a bit but then I drank a bunch of water.\nJ: :( Not me, I'm thinking about dessert rn lol\nC: :( Must be cuz you didn't have wine?

Thank you for giving diners the feel of a luxurious experience by keeping the d\u00e9cor classy and warm. I love the black brick walls and the bold abstract paintings that adorn it. \n\nHow's the food? I don't know how the Stone's Throw/Fat Angel team do it, but you'll feel like a classy broad on a night out in town while only paying 3500 pennies for dinner. The menu does have limited choices, but guaranteed to serve you what's in season and they usually offer fish/meat for the main entr\u00e9e. \n\nThere were 4 of us who dined so we got to try the whole menu. Tender three-pea salad with goat cheese croquettes in a charred lemon vinaigrette; a delightful French onion soup with gouda cheese; braised beef short rib with confit potatoes and crispy arctic char with creamy polenta. Dessert came as beautiful plates of chai chocolate mousse with cocoa nibs and poached pears and a chevre cheesecake with roasted pistachio and strawberries.

It was smooth, creamy and flavorful, and I loved the diced squash and walnuts included. Our pasta supplements were lobster risotto and garganelli with tomato and broccolini. The garganelli was underwhelming, but we enjoyed the lobster risotto. For entrees we had the crispy skin salmon and the braised beef shortribs. Both were divine! I love crispy skin on salmon because crunchy food is my favorite texture! The salmon was cooked perfectly and the veggies and grapes complemented the fish. The braised beef shortribs were super tender and you could pull it apart with a fork! This also had some charred eggplant and crispy onions that paired perfectly with the slightly sweet meat. By the time we finished our entrees, we were stuffed! Somehow we still finished dessert though, which was a diablo cake (basically chocolate cake) and coconut custard. The diablo cake came with ice cream, peanut mousse, and sweet and salty peanuts. So much texture in one little bite! The coconut custard was my favorite, and I don't even like coconut. The pandan creme, toasted coconut flakes, and lime shortbread definitely brought the dessert together.\n\nDon't set your heart on any one item on the menu, because it seems like it changes pretty frequently, if not every day! One thing I do like about the menu is the simplicity, as well as the variations of food. For example, they usually have a soup or salad for appetizer, fish or meat for entree, and something chocolate-y/richer and a fruity dessert. There's really something for everyone to order, or you can share everything like my bf and I did!\n\nService was super friendly, they definitely know fine-dining but in a more casual setting. Waters were always filled and waiters frequently came around, making sure that our dining expereince was going well. My only gripe is that the tables were pretty close together, so conversations are pretty loud and it can be less intimate. Other than that, no complaints!", "author": "Tara A."}

Kale caesar salad - best caesar dressing I've ever had, but otherwise just a handful of kale.  Pork chop - dry. Trout - served with tasty vegetables but actual meat overcooked.  Supplemental pasta dish good but not memorable. Dessert sadly fell the flattest - one was a Guinness chocolate cake with bacon ice cream and some other fancy bits and bites - cake was dry and tasteless.  The sauce tasted like they scraped the bottom of a pan that held bacon grease drippings - very smokey.  The bacon ice cream - didn't taste like bacon.

They offer a prix fixe 3-course menu which they change regularly for $35 or with an added pasta supplement for $45. The place is small so I don't recommend coming with a group larger than 5 or 6 people, and I managed to get a reservation for a Thursday night at 5:30pm. They were named one of the Top 100 restaurants in SF so definitely worth trying, but I would recommend making a reservation since even after 5:30 they place was fully filled.\n\nThe interior is simple with a modern, rustic feel with the wooden tables. Everything I ordered was superb. I got the chicken tortilla soup that was like a warm, creamy soup with latin flare. Did not get any pasta unfortunately, and for the entree I got the crispy-skin striped bass. The skin was definitely crispy, flavorful, and the combination of textures from the fish, the beans, and the calamari was delightful. Finally, for dessert, the huckleberry coffee cake had the perfect presentation and not too fluffy nor thick. My friend got the caprese tart as an app and the chocolate pound cake for dessert, also very tasty although I preferred my choices haha.", "author": "Alexa T."}

I had organized a work dinner at Trestle for an out-of-town colleague. We arrived promptly for our 8:45 reservation, but things were running extremely late at the restaurant. Indeed it was clear that the evening had gone pear-shaped and that we had little chance of being seated any time soon. The host, Ryan Cole, was apologetic and offered to call nearby alternatives. We ended up having an indifferent tapas experience across the street. I was moderately steamed at the experience, but it just looked like the restaurant was having a hard time that evening, with only a few tables even having food in front of them when we came in. \n\nI was planning on writing the restaurant to let them know of my disappointment. But upon checking my email the next morning, I found that Ryan had already emailed me, at midnight on the night of. It was an incredibly kind and generous email, with Ryan offering to send me a gift certificate to compensate for the evening. I of course accepted and it was a shockingly generous compensation. \n\nI then returned to Trestle last week. Ryan greeted me at the door and we had an excellent experience. The food was what you'd expect from Trestle - tasty preparation of modern American food, but without ridiculously high-end ingredients (my main course was trout). They've also spent a lot of effort on their beer list. \n\nMy only complaint is that Trestle is extremely loud.

The fixed menu that I had for the night consisted of:\n\n- Asparagus and falafel salad (5/5): Oh man. I'm not even that big a fan of asparagus but this stuff was good. Each one was charred just the right amount and had a great smoky taste while retaining some sweet tinges. The falafels were just the right amount of crisp on the outside and was savory and flavorful on the inside. Every part of the dish brought some unique, light flavors and different textures that made it one of the most delightful salads I've ever consumed.\n\n- Mushroom Pappardelle (4.5/5): The homemade pasta had just the right bite to it and the poached egg (after being broken and mixed in) provided a delicious creaminess while the porcini mushroom slices added some savoriness to compliment it. The prosciutto crisps were yummy but felt a bit salty and out of place compared to the rest of the dish though.\n\n- King Salmon (4/5): The salmon was cooked amazingly. Looked to be cooked probably 80% skin side down and the flipped at the end which made the skin crispy while the rest of the fish was tender and buttery. The bed of creamed corn was a nice touch of sweetness accomodate the fish. The beans that came on the side were well-seasoned but otherwise pretty average.\n\n- Dark Chocolate Mousse (5/5): I don't have much of a sweet tooth but this dessert was delicious. The mousse was light yet rich in flavor with some strawberry (or was it raspberry?) puree/jam that provided enough tart and sweetness to cut through some of the richness of the chocolate. Overall a really light dessert that wasn't overly sweet.\n\nI really enjoyed the menu on the night I went and managed to leave decently full as well.

However, the two of us did pay the extra $10 to try the pasta of the day. \n\nI'll let the pictures speak for itself. The taste was good but it won't blow you away. If it wasn't for the price then I would've given it 3 stars. Service was superb but the tables are WAY too close to each other. I was bumping elbows with the people next to me. Not a great place to have a conversation since the space is small already so the noise just amplifies. \n\nOverall, due to the price I would recommend coming for special occasions.

I don't even remember what my 100th review was for, since that was such a long time ago lol.  But even though there were a few other places I was thinking about I had to save this one for Trestle.  \n\nBooking a reservation here can be challenging since Trestle is so popular, but if you book it far enough in advance you should be able to get a decent time.  To be honest, I was not expecting much considering the low price ($35) and the menu being prix fixe with very limited options... however considering the flavors, service, ambiance, and overall value, it was one of my favorite dining spots of last year and I can't wait to go back!  \n\nTrestle offers two choices for each course: appetizer, main, and dessert. You have the option of adding a supplement dish for $10 and they offered two choices as well for that.  My date and I were able to try everything except for one of the $10 supplement dishes.  \nWe had the: \n- Calamari and Smoked Fingerling Potato (app)\n- Roasted Red and Golden Beet Salad (app)\n- Butternut Squash Risotto (supplement)  \n- Crispy Skin Branzino (main)\n- Thyme and Garlic-stuffed Roast Quail (main)\n- Fuyu Persimmon Cake (dessert)\n- Chocolate Pot De Creme (dessert)\n\nEverything was delicious, but what really stood out from what I can remember was the Thyme and Garlic-stuffed Roast Quail.  I picked the bones clean on that little bird!  Talk about flavor explosion.  The entire meal doesn't seem like a lot of food at first but trust me it is enough to leave you satisfied, especially if you add the supplement dish.  For $80 before tax and tip, this meal was a steal.  I kept telling my date I would have expected to pay $200 for this kind of meal at most other restaurants in SF.  It was a simple, but excellent menu in my opinion, and it definitely was not over complicated or small and pretentious.  You can view the menu on their webpage for their daily offerings.  \nI recommend you give this place a try for anytime, any occasion since it is so affordable! =)", "author": "Dean S."}

I had been crying sporadically at the thought of being failed by our country. Sensations were numb, colors in the street were faded, food no longer had taste... I was a fucking mess.\n\nAnd then we arrived at Trestle. My brother and the hostess made eye contact, shrieked with excitement, ran towards each other, and hugged. I was like \"Do you guys know each other?\" to which they replied, \"No, we just spoke over the phone.\" LOL, wut? From that point on, I convinced myself to stop sulking in sadness because this dinner was about to be a treat. And I was right-- everyone from the hostess Nicole to our server was so warm, hospitable, and HILARIOUS. Really great vibe and attitude they have going on here, I'll definitely come back for more laughs.\n\nAs for the food:\n-ROASTED BEETS & BURRATA: Great, refreshing starter. Because who doesn't love burrata amirite?!\n-CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP: Honestly the best cream of mushroom soup I've ever had, and I am a soup fanatic. I loved the addition of enoki mushrooms, and the mignonette really bumped up the complexity of the soup.\n-POACHED LOBSTER PAPPARDELLE: Yummy fresh pasta in the perfect amount of creamy, cheesy sauce. \n-BAKED GARGANELLI: Surprisingly more flavorful than the pappardelle. If rotini and penne had a baby, this would be it. The butternut squash and sage gremolata made every crunchy breadcrumb-covered bite addicting. If you can't get both pastas, pick this one.\n-PAN-ROASTED SALMON:  Instead of a plate of just pan-roasted salmon (yawn), we were presented with a bowl of salmon, clams, mussels, and lobster pieces floating in a bouillabaisse broth. Fun fact! This one time in middle school I won the spelling bee with the word \"bouillabaisse.\" Now whenever I see it, I am instantly hyped lol. This was no exception, and each bite gave me Ratatouille-like feels. I am not usually a seafood over meat kind of person, but I personally liked this dish over the short rib, especially with the addition of other high quality ingredients.\n-BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB: The only dish that wasn't outstanding. The flavors and the textures were all fantastic, but the short rib itself was a little on the dry side. Thankfully this was my brother's dish lol.\n-WHITE PEPPER FINANCIER: An upscale spin on the classic cake and ice cream combo. Good choice if you're a cake for dessert kind of person\n-CHOCOLATE POT DE CR\u00c8ME: Wonderful velvetty pot de creme! Combined with the citrus flavors and the crunch from the streusel, each bite was reminiscent of those throwback chocolate balls that broke up into orange wedges. I licked my dish clean!\n\nAs I previously said, the service here is over the top amazing. My family had a blast and my mom felt nothing short of special. Another plus: the menu changes every few days so there's always something new to try. My brother and I will definitely be back!\n\nNote: the serving sizes are perfectly filling. It was pretty funny because we got home and I watched everyone fall into a narcoleptic food coma in the living room. Definitely worth $35pp!", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

I know I'm repeating what everyone else who's gone to Trestle has had, but that should be enough to have you running over to try the place. I took my friend here for his birthday knowing that Stone's Throw treats their birthday guests very well. He got a handwritten card and a little candle in his dessert, which was cute. \n\nWe tried the corn chowder, little gem caeser salad, sausage stuffed quail, citrus bavaroix and chocolate cake. The salad was just an ordinary salad, although the parmesan and small salted fish were a nice touch. The corn chowder is so rich and flavorful; they serve it with just the toppings and pour in the actual chowder. The quail was definitely the highlight of the night. It was tender and smoky, and we had to control ourselves so we didn't rush through the dish in two minutes. The dish itself looked super fragile (you won't believe how small the bones in that thing are) and was beautifully plated. \n\nMy citrus dessert came with a bunch of flowers that I wasn't sure were edible. I ate them anyway. Desserts were good, though not as noteworthy since I was still blown away by how tasty the quail was. The portions are definitely small, so maybe plan a trip to McDonald's afterwards to fill up the empty space in your stomach.

Reservations can be difficult to make, so that may take some planning or coming here during unpopular hours. The surprise is that their menu is always changing, so that's fun and unique. While that creates variety, I can also be indecisive which is what makes me love this restaurant so much; they have a 3 course pre-set menu for $35 with only two options. So this is basically the perfect place for two with each person getting a different dish and sharing them.\n\nOn the night I came, we started off with the Burrata and Chicory Salad and Roasted Chestnut Soup for appetizers. The salad was okay while the soup was exactly what I needed on a cold night. Next, we added the supplementary pasta for an additional $10. We chose the Mushroom Pappardelle, which was definitely a favorite of mine. The thick pasta covered in the creamy sauce and mushrooms with a poached egg on top was tasteful and fullfilling. By the time our main course came around, I was getting pretty full. We shared the Crispy Skin Salmon and Braised Beef Shortrib. The salmon had an Asian flavor, especially with the dumpling soup. The shortrib was good as well, but was a bit dry in my opinion. I couldn't even finish my half and left it to my date as I really wanted to save room for the dessert. This was the best part, especially because anything green tea wins my heart. We each ordered our own Green Tea Custard rather than trying the Carrot Cake. I seriously can't get over the creamy green tea custard topped with black sesame sprinkles for a nice texture. To add, there were bits of lychee and ginger cracker to please your tastebuds.\n\nSidenote: The restaurant is close enough to walk off the wonderful meal couple with the Embarcadero just a couple blocks away.

Like, they are FINE but never mind-blowingly good. If it isn't the food, then the service is lacking, or the wait time is ridiculous, or the dishes are unbalanced... basically my friend says I often drink \"haterade.\" I am happy to report, however, that Trestle lives up to the hype and gets a solid 5 stars from me!\n\nReservations/ Wait time/ Service: First, the reservations were a bit difficult to get when we were trying to go as a big party but for a party of two, it wasn't hard to get next day reservations. We were immediately seated once we got there and presented the menu. The service was IMPECCABLE. Our glasses were never, ever, even remotely empty. The servers changed our utensils between every course and was mindful when we were sharing a dish to bring separate serving utensils. The courses came out quickly and dishes were removed just as efficiently. We never had to flag the waiter down for anything. While many of you may think this sounds like standard service, believe me, unfortunately for many places it is not. \n\nFood: The food was amazing. I had the green garlic and potato soup, short rib ravioli, duck leg confit, and grapefruit panna cotta. Everything was delicious and fresh. The one thing that made this restaurant really stand out has to be was how well balanced everything was. The thick soup was paired with crispy shallots and chorizo to give it texture, the heavy ravioli balanced with lightly pickled onions, the salty, tender duck confit with the sweet and crunch Asian pear... Clearly the dishes were well thought out and intended to be a well rounded experience within itself. I was extremely impressed. \n\nPricing: The 35 per person 3 course meal was perfectly priced and left my friend and I leaving satisfied. We opted to share an additional pasta course for and extra $10 and it was very worth it. When the courses came out originally, I thought they seemed small. However, everything was very filling. $35 per person is a steal for the quality, service, and creativity of the dishes. \n\nBathroom: I thought the bathroom was really cute with its two tone wood design!\n\nTrestle is one place that won't be shoved in my \"been there, done that\" list of restaurants that were fine but I don't feel the need to visit again.

I was told that it was hard to get reservations at a prime time so made them over a month in advance. I'm not clear how often they rotate their menu but between my two roommates, we ordered all 6 items. We opted out of the pasta option though. \n\nTrestle is kind of hidden and it took a little bit of looking around to notice the glass door. The d\u00e9cor is trendy chic and great for a date or business meeting. It's a fairly small space and some of the tables in the middle of the room were placed a bit too close. We had a table along the wall but I saw two separate couples seated within like 6 inches of each other, so try to grab a booth is possible.\n\nThe options in our menu included the little gem salad, clam chowder, pan roasted salmon w/ polenta, thyme & garlic roasted stuffed chicken, salted caramel brownie, and blackberry hand pies. The service was great and the food high quality but very little of the meal jumped out in terms of flavor, complexity, or innovation. The most notable for me was the clam chowder and the blackberry hand pies.\n\nClam chowder: Not your typical New England style. Instead, this was lighter but still maintained that creaminess that makes good chowder. The clams were also fresh and served in the shell. My roommate claimed that it was the best part of the meal and that she really enjoyed the different take on a very classic soup. \n\nBlackberry hand pies: Two hand pies drizzled in lime icing with a dollop of fresh black pepper cream. Each of the elements within the dessert were just okay independently. The black pepper cream alone was like a kick in the face and the hand pie crust to filling ratio was a bit off causing it to be a tad dry. However, a bite of all components combined was like an evolving palate of flavors. The lime cut into the sweetness of the blackberry which was further complimented by the spice of the pepper. It just all worked.", "author": "Liza X."}

Very few restaurants are able to beat the price at $35 a set menu. Reservations are hard to come by but just keep an eye out for cancellations, or if you're willing to wait until past 9PM for dinner, then this place should work for you. I had a blast dining here, and love the modern Scandinavian furniture that they used to design this place - BUT portions were pretty small. Given that this is a three course meal, I was still full at the end, but I would have preferred our main dish to be larger, and our dessert to be a smaller portion. \n\nKeep in mind, I dined back in December but never got around to writing my review. They change up their menu daily so some of the items may not be around anymore. Though I do see that they tend to keep their more popular items :)\n\nI went w/ a friend & we both got the little gem salad (ironically my favorite part of the meal, it's hard to make salads delicious! The fruit and avocado were fresh and pretty large). I got the pan seared trout, and my friend got the duo of chicken. I usually am more impressed with the seafood but this time I was more impressed with the meat dish - don't miss out on this one! The chicken mean is super tender, all the flavors used to make this dish mix in extremely well together. For dessert, we got one of each - earl grey chocolate ganache tart and the fuyu persimmon cake. I was really excited for the earl grey chocolate ganache tart because I love anything earl grey ... but this turned out to be more chocolate rather than earl grey. I feel they could have done more mixing of the two flavors.. the dessert turned to be a bit nauseating sweet towards the end. \n\nOverall, a 4/5 stars for Trestle. I was considering 3.5, but quality of food and service bumped it up to 4.", "author": "Annie L."}

We were able to change the number of ppl in our reservation from 2 to 4 without a hitch. When we arrived, the table was ready and we were seated immediately and also greeted warmly by the hostess who we had spoken to re the reservation change. \n\nThe 3 course menu had great options. I went with the green garlic potato soup, garganelli bolognese (+$10 pasta option), crispy skin artic char and ended with a decadent chocolate pot de creme. Despite each course seeming small in portion size, I was stuffed. Everything was delicious!!! They also had a pretty extensive wine menu. Wait time between each course was perfect and we really enjoyed ourselves. \n\nGreat value at $35 although w wine and pasta supplement, it was closer to $60-65 per person. In our party of 4, we were able to sample all the options and in my opinion, the only dish that was below average was the other dessert option (passion fruit cake, pretty dry). \n\nThe check arrived in a guest book that we could sign in and we had a lot of fun with our own rendition of dog or muffin (google it) :)\n\nCan't wait to come back when the menu changes!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-20", "description": "If the logo for Trestle is a whimsical bear playfully dancing with leaves, does that make it a non lazy bear? In any case, Trestle is definitely loads more affordable than the real Lazy Bear, and one can claim that it falls on the ranks of legit fine dining.\n\nIt's ideal for date night because each course has two options. If you are both omnivorous, you can get one of each and you would essentially try the whole menu, all while avoiding indecisiveness, second thoughts due to prices, and FOMO. \n\nOne would benefit from not only mindful eating, but also mindful ambiance-soaking in appreciating the sophisticated European vibe: exposed trestles with tall ceilings, vintage print wallpaper, exposed brick, lovely wooden tables, and a towering flower arrangement. It feels simultaneously romantic and comfortable, especially since the servers have ebullient personalities, and the lighting is normal (unlike dramatically candlelit places with stuffy, starchy service). Note that it's so cozy, some tables are right next to one another.\n\n1 | Apps\n*Caution* If you are as obsessive with food pictures as I am, be sure to intercept the soup at its arrival. It's presented in a bowl with artistically laid out ingredients, and the actual soup in a separate cup that is poured over in front of you. I had no time to appreciate the arrangement of the dry ingredients, much less take a picture, before it was all submerged save for a few leaves sticking out like the tip of an iceberg. (I'm sure I had a look of horror as the masterpiece disappeared before my eyes)\n- Food porn tips aside, the BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP (cranberry-chipotle jam, maple, smoked pepitas) was a delightful debut. The squash puree was soothing and augmented with the infusion of sweet and smokey tones. Curiously, I was most enthralled by the temperature: Goldilocks precision of warmth, a degree shy of the threshold for too warm.\n- I liked the crunchiness and slight bitterness of the LITTLE GEM SALAD (duck liver mousse, candied peanuts, persimmon), though the duck liver mousse didn't mesh well and seemed to be added just to make the salad fancy.\n\n2 | Firebrand bread\nOmg... rustic bread, lightly buttered and toasted to an optimal crisp. The precision promotes this to artisan toast.\n\n3 | Pasta supplement \nWe passed on the more basic garganelli bolognese (calabrian chili oil, burrata, basil) and opted for the MUSHROOM RISOTTO (porcini, black truffle, grana padano). The combination of boldly al dente rice and seamless blend of umami made the dish hearty and brimming with flavor. I daresay it actually smelled truffley, though I'm not bouge enough to be able to detect truffles as well as the dogs that hunt for them. \n\n4 | Mains\n-The CRISPY-SKIN SALMON (creamy farro, Brussels sprouts, candied black walnuts) initially turned me off because I detest scaly fish skin, but the roasty crisp layer turned out remarkably tasty. It reminded me remotely me of salmon teriyaki, except with melt-in-your-mouth succulence and robustly omega-3-y-tasting (for lack of a better description). The side was excellent as well, almost an afterthought of the complex risotto prior.\n- I couldn't help but think of the FRIED QUAIL (fingerling potatoes, coleslaw, BBQ jus) as a State Bird knockoff. Just like at State Bird, the fried quail tasted unsatisfyingly similar to fried chicken, and the BBQ sauce take was not particularly memorable. Trestle does do a good job in tuning the crisp and the moistness, but overall I was more impressed by the other dishes.\n\n5 | Desserts\n- The WHITE PEPPER FIANCIER (black mission figs, pecans, vanilla ice cream) had a style similar to Japanese desserts--not too sweet, perfected consistency, highly gratifying but not indulgent.\n- The CHOCOLATE MOUSSE (chocolate angel food cake, plum, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche). Mmm, this is more indulgent, but the mousse and cake remain balanced and tempered, a nice end to the meal.\n\nTrestle's specialty is its mastery of simple but synergistic ingredients--the fine dining of home-cooked food at its finest. Although the menu changes weekly, some items are similar and I'm quite content having tried it just once. The total came out to ~$90 total pre-tip for the prix fixe for 2 with one order of the pasta supplement. \n\nAs word has gone around regarding Trestle's prix fixe, reservations fill up fast and you need to plan ahead. (I made it one and a half months ahead of time in order to get 6pm on a Saturday) Can't slack off and be a lazy bear if you want a RSVP at Trestle!", "author": "Edna C."}

This restaurant gets booked up quickly, and often the only seating time one could get is 5:30 PM. You get the staggering effect, and when you don't show up, it messes up their seating schedule. He was nursing a glass of red wine when she arrived. Ever a bit of irritation shown on his face. The waitstaff asked what she wanted to drink the moment she sat down. She opted for water to save time.\n\nThe rest of the decision was quite easy to make. This was the new 3-course tasting menu trend, if you arrive in a pair, you could just each order one thing off the menu, down to the dessert, and viola you are done. No thinking involved, no decision needs to be made. Everything made fresh and served quickly and yet not too rushed. \n\nTomato soup was one of his favorites. She knew because when they went to Cafe Prague, he ordered that too. The falafel salad was quite delightful. Squid and salmon with micro greens. Beef had a nice flavor to it. Completely perfect. Right amount of time in between each course, polished servers checked in sometimes but not too over intrusive.\n\nHe opened his birthday presents. She and he met every year for each other's birthdays. But they did not otherwise see each other much these days. For this birthday, where he was turning a milestone age, among other things, she bought him a piece of drift wood, with an old fashioned bike etched onto the wood. He biked to work often. Over bread pudding with chocolate and peach panna cotta, he became more relaxed and smiled more. She liked his bright smiles. Always did. \n\nThen just like that, he said what he wanted to say to her for a while now, \"you know, I wish that we never stopped dating.\" He looked almost solemnly. She looked around, there were a lot of couples around them that night. Perhaps it was the wine, or perhaps it was this pretty, romantic restaurant that made him say such things. She smiled, while gently touched the back of his left hand, and then said, \"And yet, we did.\" \n\nThe waitstaff took their photos sitting together.

My friend and I came in for the earliest reservation time (5:30pm) and they seated us immediately and gave us a rundown of their menu and how their restaurant works (two options for each of the three courses, you choose one of the two).  They brought us water glasses and a hipster water pitchers and poured the water for us.  Every time I took a sip of water, a waiter would return and fill up my glass even though my glass was 3/4 full.  How can you not feel like a valued diner?  Food came out and after each course, someone asked us how we enjoyed it.\n\nFood: 10 stars.  We tried to get one of each dish since there were two options per course.  For appetizers: Butternut squash soup was pretty good but the salad with poached egg was the real winner! The yolkiness of the egg was so satisfying with the salad, who would've thought.  For entree: we both got the pork schnitzel because we weren't fans of trout.  But I did see many people around us get the fish, so must be delicious.  Anyways, pork schnitzel was cut up into smaller pieces (so convenient!) and there were no bones or annoyances to deal with while eating.  Dessert: the chocolate pot de la something was alright.  Pretty basic in my opinion and not sweet enough for me but that's just my preference.  The lemon financier was really good though!  Just the right amount of citrus and sweetness.  And the ice cream that came with it matched perfectly.\n\nPrice: insane, in a good way.  $35 for THREE courses, people!!! And great service.  A huge win in my opinion.  But obviously people have caught on to such a great deal, so be sure to call to make reservations in advance because the likeliness of walking in and getting a table is slim to none.", "author": "Michelle B."}

I think once word got around about their 3 course dinner for $35 and add to that their reputation being the sister restaurant to Stones Throw, and you have now got yourself some serious restaurant buzz.  Fortunately for me, I was able to land an RSVP easily on a Monday night with me and a couple of friends.\n\nI like how the menu has different choices between course and also changes quite frequently so that your experience at Trestle will never be too alike with other diners.  Plus, if 3-courses aren't enough for those with big appetites, you can add an extra pasta course for $10.\n\nFalafel Salad w/ crispy lavash, tzatziki, mint -- http://bit.ly/1X05mJ0\nA very nice light salad to start.  The falafels were nice and crispy and added some good substance to the salad.\n\nSince I got to dine with a couple of friends, we decided to add both pasta dishes to our dinner and share between the three of us.\n\nMushroom Risotto w/ king trumpets, upland cress, shaved parmesan ($10 add. fee)-- http://bit.ly/1fNPuYn\nI'm always a sucker for a good risotto and this one didn't disappoint.  Risotto was creamy and the mushrooms and parmesan shavings gave it some nice flavor.  This was actually my favorite dish of the night.\n\nAnson Mills Polenta Ravioli w/ hollandaise, crispy prosciutto, English peas ($10 add. fee) -- http://bit.ly/1JsMT0I\nThe ravoli was good too.  Liked the crispy prosciutto!\n\nPork Schniztel w/ melted cabbage, pickled mustard seeds, cipollini onions -- http://bit.ly/1MUDeT2\nThis was my main course.  I thought it was just okay,  The schnitzel was a little dry, although the onions and mustard seeds gave it some much needed flavor.  So while I though the dish was good, it was a little bit of a disappoint being the main course.\n\nBrown Butter Financier w/ lemon curd, blackberry compote, vanilla ice cream -- http://bit.ly/1ItH92I\nThankfully, this Brown Butter Financier was a good end to my dinner.  It was sweet, but not overpowering.  Almost like a glorified Twinkie like the dessert I once had over at Prospect.\n\nI guess my first experience at Trestle was a little hit or miss, but for the most part it was a solid dinner.  Don't get me wrong though, for the price, Trestle is worth visiting several times to try different things.  Or if you're with a small group, you can actually double up on the menu and order everything and it'll still be great deal.  They definitely serve you a good amount of food that is probably enough, portion-wise, even without the pasta dishes.

I was super excited to try this place given the high reviews. Unfortunately I was super disappointed and very let down. I think it's the first time a 4.5 star rated yelp restaurant didn't pan out for me!\n\nSince the menu is fixed, my bf and I decided to divide and conquer to try everything. We ordered both appetizers, main entree, and dessert options. We also did a pasta add on.\n\nPotato garlic soup w/ egg yolk: pretty good the first few bites, but lacking in anything unique afterwards. It got a bit too creamy/cheesy by the time we got to the end of the bowl. \n\nCarrot salad: this was the better appetizer hands down. The carrots are soft and flavorful. \n\nShort Ribs: well cooked meat but way too over flavored/salty! Also honestly nothing exciting with the flavors; it's pretty straightforward.\n\nSea bass: also lackluster. It's a pretty thin piece of fish and was a bit dry for me. I also felt like it was pretty bland. I think having recently eaten the sea bass at the House, I might be holding extra high expectations. If you want fish, I'd highly recommend going there instead.\n\nButter squash risotto: this came with rock shrimp and a creamy sauce.  My bf really disliked how much heavy sauce was in this dish. Basically you have risotto and shrimp making up of like 30% of the bowl and everything else is sauce. Too heavy for our liking. Definitely not worth the extra $10 add on.\n\nChocolate Tart: this was delicious! Order this for dessert. \n\nGrapefruit panna  cotta: I think this would've tasted better if they didn't overdo the granola topping over the actual dessert. Each bite was basically me struggling to avoid getting too many crumbs stuck between my teeth.\n\nI'm not sure if it was just this menu or if we caught them on an off day.

I hadn't heard much about this restaurant but once I reviewed their website I knew it was for me.  They offer 3 courses for $35, with supplements for pasta dishes and fresh truffles.  Each course offers two options.\n\nMy friends and I ended up ordering almost everything on the menu between us, which afforded us the opportunity to try everything.  I started with the falafel with salad and pita chips, both pasta dishes (one wtih butternut squash and the other with mushrooms), the striped bass and the chocolate pot de creme.  The menu changes daily, resulting in really fresh ingredients in each dish.  The dishes were simply prepared to highlight the ingredients and were well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The portions are reasonable and are appropriate for the number of courses offered.    I would say that I left satisfied but not full. \n\nTrestle is a small restaurant so reservations are an absolute must.  The tables can be a little close to one another but it didn't feel tight or claustrophobic. There is a small waiting area which can get crowded when it's time to turn the tables.\n\nWhen I showed up there was a card from the restaurant wishing me a happy birthday!  That was a really nice touch, and a first!  A few staff members also came by our table to wish me a happy birthday.

They rotate the items on their menus daily, so check their website the day of if you are going to dine there!\n\nFor each person, you get to select one of two choices for the three categories: appetizer, main entree, and dessert.

Pretty big portions for the boys!\n- Pan-Seared Sea Scallops: lentils, delicata squash, vadouvan, and crispy leeks.\n\nI love, love, love scallops, so I was pretty disappointed when I saw Trestle was serving salmon for most of the week. (Yes, I was stalking their website for a whole week before dining there.) Since I was pretty busy at work on Friday, I wasn't able to check the website. But when we got to the restaurant, David and Allen excitedly told me they were serving scallops. The stars aligned for me! :) Although there were only two pieces, the scallops were so freaking bomb. They were perfectly seared and were moist and plump inside.\n\nDESSERTS\n- Chocolate Devil's Food Cake: honey milk chocolate pudding, black mission figs, and honeycomb.\n- Huckleberry Coffee Cake: espresso streusel, vanilla ice cream, and mint.\n\nThe coffee cake was plated beautifully and tasted bomb with the ice cream, and the boys said my dessert was better. :) I guess it pays off to be a chocolate hater sometimes!\n\nThe service at Trestle was A+, so it's perfect for any special occasion or if you just want to splurge a little.

I made a same day reservation for 2 on OpenTable (www.opentable.com) for Wednesday, September 9th at 6:15pm.\n\nTheir Thirty-five dollar prix fixe consists of three courses and an optional pasta course. Since there are two options per course, we ordered the whole menu! If you are a bread lover, please note they offer Firebrand bread upon request, so you have to ask for it. I didn't care since I'm not much of a bread person, but Peter seemed a little upset since he didn't notice they offered bread until our dessert course.\n\nAppetizers:\n*Grilled peach salad: crispy lavash, arugula, ricotta salata\n*Red kuri squash soup: maple creme fraiche, almond-sage crumble\n\nThis was my least favorite course, but I knew that was the case going in. I'm not much of a grilled fruit person, so I didn't care for the salad. Mixing savory and sweet to me feels wrong. The soup was too thick and to me, needed more salt to cut into the added sweetness.\n\nPasta ($10 supplement):\n*Mushroom risotto: king trumpets, upland cress, shaved parmesan\n*Pappardelle pasta: sauce vierge, ricotta salata, basil, breadcrumbs\n\nSurprisely, this was my favorite course! And I don't really eat much pasta. The risotto had the perfect amount of creaminess and great mushroom flavor. The pappardelle was the perfect al dente and the breadcrumbs offered a delightful crunch.\n\nMains:\n*Crispy-skin branzino: corn, polenta panisse, summer beans, salsa verde\n*Pork schnitzel: red cabbage, herbed spatzel, apple and fennel salad, mustard jus\n\nThe mains were okay. Out of the two, I liked the fish better. A touch overcooked for me, but the flavors worked together. I had a couple bites of the schnitzel and unfortunately found it a little dry and chewy. I remember thinking the katsu I fry up at home is more tender.\n\nDesserts:\n*Brown butter financier: lemon curd, blackberry compote, vanilla ice cream\n*Chocolate devil's food cake: honey-milk chocolate pudding, tiger figs, honeycomb\n\nNot big on chocolate, so I skipped that dessert. The financier was good, but by the time we got to dessert, I was full, so I couldn't eat much of it. I did like the tartness of the dish and it wasn't overly sweet.\n\nDrinks:\n*Sauvignon blanc lime rock, central hawke's bay, new zealand 2014 ($12 glass)\n*Chasselas dominique lucas 'les vignes paradis', savoie, france 2013 ($44)\n*Montepulciano dezi 'dezio', marche, italy 2012 ($43)\n*Coffee ($5 small)\n*Villefranche sauternes ($14)\n\nIt was a hot day and though I normally only order reds, we asked our waiter what he would recommend. Both bottles were great and paired nicely.\n\nOverall, I'd say the food is more of a 3, but the service and the price point make up for it. Where else in SF can you get a 4 course meal for $45 each?!

But in expensive SF, we all know what a steal $35 is for a three course!  \n\nThe restaurant is small and doesn't really have a waiting area.  Our party of three had a 6pm rezzie but we were able to get seated earlier.  The whole restaurant was filled about 30 minutes later.  My selections included: the smoked salmon appetizer, the bolognese pasta supplement (+$10), the truffle chicken with maitake mushrooms, and the white chocolate tart.  Janice and my hubby got the corn soup, & Janice enjoyed the bass for her entree.  We also asked for some of their bread since we were starving.  \n\nThe smoked salmon was a little too fishy in my opinion, but the two of them told me it tasted normal to me.  Needless to say, I made my husband swap me his luscious perfectly balanced corn soup.  The Firebrand bread was so good!  Brushed with a little bit of olive oil and grilled served with butter.  The Garganelli Bolognese was my favorite dish.  It was served with burrata which melted perfectly over the pasta and the Calabrian chili gave it a little punch.  I wish you could choose between a main or a pasta for the $35 pre fixe.  The truffle stuffed chicken was next and looked to be the size of about half of a deboned chicken breast served with dirty rice.  The meat was moist and the mushrooms were a nice touch, but we could not taste any truffle at all.  The best most truffletastic chicken I've ever had was Monterey's Restaurant 1833's.  Lastly, dessert was served.  I was the only one who got the White Chocolate Tart.  It was served with blueberries, a cream filling, and lime pate de fruite.  It was a refreshing end to the meal but was way too sweet.  Surprisingly sweeter than mine was their peach cobblers.  \n\nThe tables were so close (I joked with my husband & asked if he got pinkeye when an older gentleman with quite a big butt rubbed his butt against hubby's arm as he was getting seated at the table next to us) and it gets stuffy in there.  There's one unisex bathroom which seemed to be occupied frequently throughout the night.  Service was very friendly and attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-16", "description": "Choice is good... and just enough choice is even better. This is especially true when it comes to the pre fixe menu at Trestle. $35 for three courses + $10 per pasta supplement and you get to choose between two in-season options per course. That's a total steal and a delicious one at that. \n\nI started with the heirloom tomato salad and that was by far my favorite dish of the night. Loved the balance between the sweet and ripe tomatoes with the basil pesto vinaigrette and herbed ricotta plus crispy lavash for textural contrast. Overall a very well composed salad. Everybody else on my table had the sweet corn soup which was decent and very seasonal for summer but I definitely preferred my salad. \n\nThey recommend sharing a pasta between two people so we got both pasta courses to share since there were four of us. I thought I would have preferred the mushroom risotto which was rich and creamy but I thought could have used a little more salt. The Garganelli Bolognese on the other hand was just delightful. Al dente pasta accompanied by some burrata, basil, and a Bolognese sauce. Very satisfying.  \n\nI opted for the scallops for my entree while the rest of my table had the sausage stuffed quail which I definitely think I got the better choice between the two. Pretty large scallops perfectly seared so they had a nice crisp on the outside while remaining plump and moist on the inside. The flavorful scallops were accompanied by some calamari, hummus, and sauce vierge. \n\nA little disappointed with the desserts though. I found the warm banana bread to be dry and served with an extraneously excessive amount of peanuts. The peanut butter ice cream was a saving grace though. The brown butter financier with the berry compote was definitely the better dessert. \n\nWhile not a total hit, dinner at Trestle was really delicious and bottles of wine are reasonable too. We split two bottles of wine between us following some beers. It's a small space so you're gonna need to make reservations even for off-peak hours. All in all, a delicious deal and with an every updating menu, more reason to to return to Trestle.", "author": "Jon L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-15", "description": "So glad I finally got to try the newest gem in San Francisco's five studded crown of restaurants positioned where the Financial District, Chinatown and North Beach converge (on their website they're calling it the burgeoning \"Jackson Square\" district.)\n\nTrestle is an extremely affordable, well thought out, compact little casual restaurant on the corner of Jackson and Columbus Streets that previously housed the old Great Hunan Restaurant for many, many, many decades. I just love it when new restaurants make older buildings that once housed restaurants of yesterday seem fresh and new, which Trestle is a perfect example of that effort. The food from executive chef Jason Halverson comes across like artwork with detail and thought put into every new dish that was placed in front of us (and trust me there were a lot!). The place is compact, but airily modern, without being cold and divinely sets itself apart from the rest of the neighborhood. With the place being so compact, the service was attentive without overbearing, our plates and silverware were cleared and replaced with each new dish's arrival.\n\nTrestle exclusively offers a nightly fixed price menu, but with a very non-exclusive price tag--only 35 bucks for three courses (your pick out of two options from appetizers, main courses, and dessert) plus for 10 bucks extra you can pick from two additional pasta choices. It turns out the format was inspired by limited storage and prep areas in Trestle's small space, which made implementing an extensive menu a challenging proposition. See I love it when new places make due with their old digs and you get meals like I had the other night!\n\nSince both my friend and I were hungry, we agreed to sample all the goods that Trestle had to offer, so we decided to order both meal options for all three courses plus both pasta options so we could both share. I told you we were ravenous! Trestle is great because Chef Halverson changes his menu every few days so you have to check their menu on their website to see what you're in for for the evening you are dining. \n\nOur meal began with a salad and a soup with a Falafel Salad served with a Crispy Lavash, Tzatziki and Mint and a Roasted Tomato Soup with Focaccia, Burrata Cheese and Basil. I found the salad detailed yet delicate with their little balls of falafel. And the soup tasted like a rich sauce, although a bit on the Spaghetti-O soup side, I still found both delicious so wonderful I just didn't care. Then came the pasta, which I was so glad we ordered, the Ricotta Gnudi with Eggplant and the Shortrib Ravioli. They both tasted amazing, but the Ravioli, although not the most original dish, was the best tasting dish of the entire meal! Each ravioli was so flavorful and juicy, Shortribs combined with the Gremolata, you simply wanted to be served more! But this was a prefix menu and there was more to come...\n\nThat included our main course which included a Pan Roasted Salmon with Fingerling Potatoes, Padron Peppers, Roasted Corn, topped with a Chimichurri Vinaigrette and a Pork Schnitzel served with Melted Cabbage, Pickled Mustard Seeds, and Cipollini Onions. The Schnitzel was cooked nicely it was more or less a glorified pork chop coated with panko bread crumbs. But the salmon was the real surprise, it was cooked to perfection as each bite of fish melted in your mouth. That with the corn and the peppers, the dish tasted borderline extraordinary! All of these dishes perfectly complimented my glass of Grenache Blend Ampeleia 'Unlitro' wine, which mind you went down like grape juice. \n\nAnd then it was finally time for dessert. Tonight's two dishes were the Chocolate Pot de Creme topped with Bourbon Whipped Cream, Orange-Almond Streusel, and Cocoa Nibs and the Brown Butter Financier with Lemon Curd, Blackberry Compote and Vanilla Ice Cream. The Pot de Creme tasted like a good semi-hardened like mousse while the Financier which was basically a cake caramelized with a crispy burnt sugar. I have to admit both were rich in flavor with the cake balancing the perfect blend of sugary and sweet with a little mellowness from the ice cream to even everything out.          \n\nThe bottom line is that Trestle needs to be on everyone's \"must-try\" list, the food is original yet familiar, piquant yet comforting, and the restaurant restores your faith in what can be accomplished when restaurateurs think outside the box when presented with a space that comes across as bit opaque at first glance. Trestle is my new destination because the menu (most certainly the main courses at least) will hopefully keep changing every few days like it is supposed to, so every time you go it will be like a whole new experience for your palate to sample. On top of it being anywhee from 35-45 dollars a person your wallet won't take a hit. And for that reason we should all be celebrating Trestle's arrival on the San Francisco food scene.", "author": "Jason F."}

The restaurant is located in Chinatown and you can almost miss it if you don't know where to look. Minimalist decor with tables around perimeter make it feel very open. We had early reservations, so we're some of the first to be seated. We each opted for three courses in the tasting menu, but split a pasta course between us. The first course was between a stone fruit salad and a butternut squash soup. It was SO GOOD! Creamy and sweet, laden with heavy cream, goat cheese, butter crumb and tender pieces of zucchini. The soup was poured with the condiments already stacked in the bowl. Next, the shared pasta course-an arugula pesto with bucatini -it was slightly bitter and tasty. The pasta was a little in the soft side, but the flavor was wonderful. Next, the main course. We both opted for a striped bass in saffron broth. The broth was a deep red and completely filled with beautiful saffron smell and flavor. It had tiny potatoes and chorizo to add to the deep taste. The fish was cooked perfectly and the skin crackled under each press of the fork. The final course, admittedly, was my least favorite but I am not a sweets person. I had a steamed lemon custard-very curd like with a strong lemony taste and tender short cake to accompany it. The staff was attentive without being overbearing-our water was never empty and our table was always clean and tended to. I would highly recommend for a group outing or if you are with another foodie and want to \"discover\" a menu together.", "author": "Carolyn H."}

I had a corn soup to start and that was the highlight - velvety and super tasty. My main course was a risotto, which was supposed to be creamy but was on the chalky side. The rice wasn't cooked quite enough. The peas in the dish were the best thing about it. I've made risotto many times and the consistency is something you just learn to get right over time...a lot of restaurants don't make it because it takes too much time and care. I tasted my dining companions Garganelli Bolognese and didn't think there was anything remarkable about it. \n\nFor dessert we both had a peach cobbler and I think it was supposed to be served warm - the little pots it came in were warm-ish, but the dish itself was cold.

Definitely don't come without a reservation. It got crowded.  It was well managed, but still crowded.\n\nI love set menus. They make things so much easier. Their set up is simple, but still has flexibility. $35 - Choice between two of appetizer, main, and desert.  Add pasta for $10. Perfect for two people, right? You get everything.\n\nAppetizer: Sunchoke Soup and Beet Salad were both good, but the Sunchoke soup wins.  Just perfectly balanced and creamy.\n\nPasta: A bolognese which really was quite nice. \n\nMain: Braised Beef Short Ribs.  Wow.  So melty.  So flavorful.  How do they do that?\n\nDesert: Pumpkin Cheese Cake and Devil's Food Cake with Honey and Pear.  Both were really good, but the Devil's food/honey/pear combo was so spot on.

The menu is slightly different daily, there I guess the day we came it just wasn't that great. \n\nFalafel Salad - Not a fan, not much favor. Maybe its suppose to taste like that but not something I would order again. \nPotato Soup - The soup was good. Very flavorful. It was pretty heavy, therefore the portion they gave us was enough. \nMushroom Risotto - Risotto I love, worth the extra $10 dollars, especially the mushrooms gave it a great taste in flavor. Yum! \nPork Schnitzel - Nothing special. Pork Katsu taste way better. \nCrispy Branzino - It was too dry for me. The veggies on the side was good but the fish lack in flavor but it was crispy. But I think they over cooked my fish. \nPumpkin Cheesecake - I love pumpkin and this was yummy. So glad it was pumpkin season. \nPot de Creme - Too rich. It was okay but won't be able to eat too much of it.

The handpies and salted caramel warm brownie were a great sweet ending.

Two of my girlfriends and I decided on doing some belated birthday celebrations on a Monday night, and with the menu changing daily, it's almost like getting a surprise gift when you sit down! Since there were three of us, we were able to cover almost the entire menu for that night.  I would definitely coming here with at least 3 people so that everyone has the opportunity to try all of the menu options and the two pasta add-ons! Here's what we had:\n\nAppetizers:\nRoasted Tomato Soup with Foccacia, Burrata & Basil\nApplewood Smoked Salmon with Rye Croutons, Cucumbers, Dill, Pickled Jalapenos\n\nI had the salmon and while you don't get the traditional slices of salmon, the smoked salmon was absolutely delicious with the croutons.  The real winner on the plate though were all of the pickled items!\n\nPasta:\nAnson Mills Polenta Ravioli with Hollandaise, Crispy Prosciutto & English Peas: \n\nThis was a perfect thing to share between the three of us.  The polenta filling was creamy and corn-y, and I loved the crispy prosciutto that came with the dish.  It added the right amount of crunch to the otherwise very creamy texture dish!\n\nEntrees:\nPork Schnitzel with Grilled Peaches, Red Russian Kale & Farro Verde\nPan-Roasted Scallops with Summer Corn, Shishito Peppers & Chimichurri\n\nI had the scallops and while I thought that my dish was amazing (I was a huge fan of the summer corn with the chimichurri!), I admit that I probably would have enjoyed the pork schnitzel better.  Tasting very similar to tonkatsu, the pork wasn't dry and when eaten all together with a little bit of the peach and kale, it made for a very complete and well rounded dish.\n\nDesserts:\nChocolate Brownie Bananas Foster with Banana Ice Cream, Caramel, Candied Walnuts\nBrown Butter Financier with Lemon Curd, Blackberry Compote & Vanilla Ice Cream\n\nI opted for the brown butter financier and I'm glad I did since the chocolate brownie looked and tasted incredibly rich.  The dessert itself was good, but it certainly paled in comparison to the other dishes we had.  I definitely enjoyed the crispy crumbs that dusted the plate, and the vanilla ice cream was refreshing with the blackberry compote.\n\nService wise, our server gave us enough attention when we needed it and left us alone when we needed it.  I enjoyed the pace in which everything came out since I'm sure it's easy to dish out the plates at a rapid fire pace with such a focused menu.

The service was amazing. I still think about the corn chowder and seabass.

We each opted for 3 courses + the pasta dish. We also asked for wine pairings, which they don't officially do, but our waitress was confident she could choose good wines, so we let her!\n\nFirst course: tomato salad / corn soup. Both were great! I love soup, especially creamed corn, so I was a happy camper. The tomato salad was delicious too with the pesto and crispy wontons.\nSecond course: tri-tip ravioli / mushroom risott0. Both were pretty heavy. I don't know if I was a fan of such a hearty ravioli, and the risotto was kind of plain. They needed to some how meet in the middle.. or add truffle oil. \nThird course: we both had the quail because neither of us liked scallops. The quail was DELICIOUS. I love quail. i'm so happy I came on this day! The grains were a little too tough.. but YUMYUMYUM!\nDessert: meyer lemon cake w/ berries and vanilla ice cream / chocolate truffle idk. I LOOOOOOOOVED my dessert (the former). I wouldn't even share even though we had agreed to share it all. I would go back just to have this dessert again.\n\nOh, and don't forget to try their bread!

North Beach is on a serious roll w revamping old spaces into shiny new restaurants...Doc Ricketts, Devil's Acre (drinks only), Ferry Plaza Seafood, etc.  Now there's Trestle to add to that list.  Tiny, warm, & intimate.  Even the lighting is right.  Exposed brick & knockout flower arrangements.  It's simple & classy.  Really well done.\n\nWe ordered one of everything.  Out of the 8 dishes, only one of the mains was subpar.\n\nThe asparagus salad was full of flavor, multi-textural, & uber fresh.  The corn chowder, something I thought would be predictably lackluster, was actually superb.  The kitchen nailed it w the flavors & consistency.  And the mushroom risotto, something I wasn't excited about initially, turned out to be the creamiest risotto that I've ever had.  \n\nMy salmon main did not disappoint; but my man did not love his roasted quail.  At all.  The center of the bird had a strange consistency, & he felt it was undercooked.  He really wanted to like this dish, but only took a few bites.  When I told him he should let our server know, he was totally reluctant.  That's just not his style.  So when our server specifically asked about the dish, I relayed what my man had told me.  Not only did she encourage & appreciate the honest feedback, she took it off of the check.  Accommodating, professional, & personable service.\n\nFinally, the 2 desserts, the warm brownie sundae & the peach panna cotta were a nice juxtaposition; one rich & decadent, the other light & refreshing.  \n\nThe 4 courses were a lot of food.  The pasta dishes sent me over; I just couldn't possibly kill my salmon dish.  I'm thinking next time I will customize the 4 options into only the 3 dishes that I want the most.  \n\nDining at Trestle is a pure pleasure.  They succeed at all points...classic comfort dishes w innovative touches, comfortable yet refined space, professional but unstuffy service.  And all for the nice price, too.\n\nA fabulous addition not only to north beach, but to the city itself.", "author": "Veronica M."}

We're usually the first diners at an empty restaurant (I like eating early to avoid the chaos during peak time). Thank goodness we're well over the first stage of dating awkwardness...of staring at the ceiling and twiddling our thumbs.  Well, that's until the booze kicks in. Nothing like a little liquid courage to get the party started!\n\nLast night, we arrived at 5:30 pm for our reservations at Trestle and it was popping! By 6 pm, all except one two-top was full. Reservations are a must!\n\nGiven how much we loved Stones Throw, I was hopeful that Trestle, their sister restaurant would be just as great (opened April 28th). Offering a prix-fixe menu of three courses for a very reasonable $35, Trestle is a welcome change to $30+ micro mini entrees that have been popping up in the city (I'm looking at you, Aster). You won't have to grab a slice of pizza at Golden Boy afterwards because the portions are filling. We added the pasta dish for an extra $10 and my food baby busted out of my spanx before dessert. Wine and beer only. There are a lot of affordable bottles of wine for under $50. No romancing the bottle since I had to come into work today so I ordered wine by the glass ($9-$15).\n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\nThe rotating menu changes daily so don't get your heart set on something you see on yelp. For each of the prix-fixe menu, you get to select one of two choices for each of the 3 categories (starter, entr\u00e9e, dessert). We choose one of everything plus the two pastas so we can sample the entire menu that day.   \n\n*(1a) Little Gem Salad w/ crispy bacon, sunny side up egg, dijon vinaigrette: http://bit.ly/1DPfiYx\n*(1b) English Pea \"Chowder\" w/ smoked salmon, mint, potato: http://bit.ly/1GUHwWm\n*Garganelli Bolognese w/ burrata, basil, chili (+$10): http://bit.ly/1I8zBGz\n*Anson Mills Polenta Ravioli w/ corn pur\u00e9e, prosciutto, spring onion (+$10): http://bit.ly/1GUHH3Y\n*(2a)Thyme & Garlic Roasted Chicken w/ roasted carrots, panzanella, chicken fat vinaigrette: http://bit.ly/1AzVwjy\n*(2b) Crispy Skin Mediterranean Seabass w/ olive tapenade, calamari salad, fregola, radicchio: http://bit.ly/1R6cErS\n*(3a)Strawberry & Rhubarb Pavlova: http://bit.ly/1ERExie\n*(3b)Warm Chocolate Brownie Sundae w/ vanilla ice cream, salted caramel, walnuts: http://bit.ly/1dI8MxW\n\nSurprisingly, the dishes I normally wouldn't order, I loved. You can never go wrong with bacon and a runny yolk so I really enjoyed the little gem salad. I wanted to go cave girl status on the ravioli filled with creamy polenta. I enjoyed the salty crunch from the prosciutto and the fresh sweetness from the corn. I usually avoid ordering chicken when eating out but my goodness, this Per Se style roasted chicken was phenomenal. The breast was the most tender breast I've ever sunk my teeth into and was stuffed with umptious chicken mousse mixture of thighs and cr\u00e8me fraiche. It's a damn shame that I had to share this dish. The dense chocolately brownie was sinfully delicious especially with the temperature contrast from the vanilla ice cream and the oooey goooey salted caramel sauce. \n\nAs for the other dishes, they were good but were just outshined by my favs above I still like Stones Throw better though). The two courses I didn't like were the pea chowder (too thick) and the seabass because the olive tapenade was very overpowering. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nIf I could take the Trestle staff to every restaurant I go to, I would have a stellar experience every time. They were all genuinely warm, friendly, and attentive. Our waiter rocked! He was super knowledgeable of the menu and made great wine suggestions. One of the staff from Stones Throw remembered me from my visit long ago and was kind enough to stop and say, \"hi\". Talk about a steel trap memory. \n\nConsidering how busy they were, food service was pretty timely. From start to end, our leisurely 4 course meal took about 90 minutes. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I  A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nGeesus Christ, they did a great job transforming the old Great Hunan restaurant with nauseating green walls to something urban chic (black exposed brick walls and wooden beams) yet minimalist so your attention is on the food and wine. The space is oddly shaped but they make great use of it and can accommodate about 40 diners. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nParking is a nightmare in the surrounding area but Sunday is the easiest day of the week to find parking in the FiDi area. There's a parking garage next door that charges $4/hour after 5 pm.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We arrived earlier, opted for a walk in the lively neighborhood and came back on time.\n\nSmall, but smart prix fixe menu. We both had the 3-course plus one. Portion sizes were just right. Thoughtful pauses between the courses. Subtly seasoned salmon dish balanced out the strong aftertaste of pepper and vinegar - from salad and risotto, respectively. \n\nService team was efficient. The place was so full, servers must have felt rushed. They, upon serving, explained in details the components of the dishes, but didn't waste much time on salad, just said Burrata with vegetables. We identified what those vegetables were on our own. The place was so loud, we could barely hear them anyway.\n\nThe young couple at the corner table were visibly in the mood for love. Their check arrived seemingly unexpected. They left and their table remained unoccupied.

I really love the idea behind a three course prix fixe meal with seasonal and wholesome ingredients. It's nice to have that fine dinning experience in a cozy environment. \n\nSince the menu changes so frequently, it's difficult to just judge the food. The experience must be judged as a whole. I obviously enjoyed the idea behind Trestle and appreciated the experience I had. \n\nThe service was great when I went. I have read it's a little iffy but Stuart was the host and greeted up graciously. We also came about 30 minutes earlier than our reservation and since it was fairly early for dinner, there was a set for us. The tables are mighty close! There was literally four inches between my table and the next. It was a slight hassle to get in and out, but I can see that it's going for that family feel. The servers were polite and described each course as it came out. I could tell that they have been trained for fine dining. So expect that your utensils will be changed after every course, table wiped in between, and napkins folded when you leave the table. It's nice to have that server without that uppity, snob atmosphere. \n\nThe food was really good! In order to taste everything, my boyfriend and I ordered opposites. We also got the two additional pasta plates. It was definitely a lot of food! But I do like how the food was portioned. It was mindful of the entire meal. My favorites include the mushroom risotto and I liked the sausage-stuffed quail with the salmon plate's sides (corn and bean salad). To have a little more fun with the courses, I think that you should try at least one bit with every component in it. For example, the salmon plate came with creamed corn, summer bean salad, and corn panisse. Everything tasted great separately, but they also taste wonderful all together. It really goes to show the skill of the chef. \n\nI'll definitely come back when the menu changes, and I look forward to trying the other Hi Neighbor restaurants and hope for the success of their new projects.", "author": "Tina Y."}

The salad had interesting components but was overall a little too acidic with not much counterbalancing, the presentation was artsy but I did not find it aesthetically appealing. The seabass looked beautiful, but the portion was pretty small and the flavor of the meat didn't wow me. I liked the grilled veggies and the lemon sauce was the star of the plate. Lastly, the passionfruit cake looked the best, and was good and refreshing but again too small of a dish. Also, I was a little unsure whether I was supposed to eat the flowers but they seemed pretty well integrated so I just ate them. \n\nThe service was good and the place seems fancy, but it was just a facade and this particular menu was disappointing.", "author": "Steven V."}

Reservations were made 2 weeks before for table of 2 and no trouble getting a spot. Most people already know this place for it's prix fix 3 course meal for only $35. Probably the best deal out there in SF! \n\nFOOD:\nThe 3 main courses are appetizer, entree and dessert and an optional pasta course for additional $10. Everything course includes 2 different options. Me and BF usually like to try different things, so we got one of everything minus one of the pasta courses. \n1) Appetizer:\n-Tomato Soup: cucumber, melon, basil, yogurt and tomato puree. I loved loved the addition of the melon, it adds surprisingly fresh splash with the flavors. Genius!   .\n-Falafel Salad: mix of a variety of greens, yogurt cream, 4 falafel balls and cherry tomatoes. Great mix, some of the greens were too exotic for my taste. \n2) Pasta: \n- Brentwood Corn Risotto: black truffle butter, potato and corn. This dish was soooo good. The mix of truffle butter and freshness of the corn with the risotto worked so well together. \n3) Entree: \n- King Salmon: salmon was very tender and had some sort of curry cause and deep fried potato and veggies \n- Pork: this reminded me of katsu Pork was on top of a bed of mini pasta and cheese and veggies. Worked very well. \n4) Dessert\n- White Chocolate Tart with blueberries: loved the tart and the white chocolate ganche. They added some clear gelatin on the sides that were way too sweet. \n- Deconstructed Peach Cobbler?: this dish was wayyyy too sweet for us. It was a peach compote with way too much added sugar. The crumbles were a great touch but I wish there were more of the crumbles to balance the sweetness out. \n\nSERVICE:\nI would change nothing about it. From the moment we stepped in the restaurant, service was top notch. Very attentive. Constantly refilling our waters, set up our silver wear for each course, even fold our napkins when we left if on the table to use the restroom. Since we noted it was a bday dinner, they included a bday card and added a extra candle and \"happy birthday\" to one of the desserts :) \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThe restaurant itself is actually quite small. Decor is very hip and has a nice earthlyxmodern feel to it. There are tables for parties from 2-8. Location has horrible street parking as expected, but there is a parking structure right next to the restaurant $2/30mins. We ended up paying $8.   \n\nI would come back to get out their other items, I'll probably give them some time to completely update their menu.", "author": "Samantha F."}

For $35, you get a 3-course prix-fixe with 2 choices for each course: appetizer, entree, and dessert. You can also add on a pasta dish for $10. For 4 people, I recommend each person getting the prix fixe and getting 2 pasta plates to split between the 4 people. If you're a picky eater or a vegetarian, you probably won't want to eat here. Selfishly, I almost don't want to tell people how good this place is, because I want to keep it my hidden secret. This place is on the smaller side and it's already hard to get a reservation at the last minute -- you'll have to make reservations around 30 days in advance for a decent seating time.\n\nI've been here twice, once shortly after it opened (July 2015), and recently (April 2016), and have loved every dish I've had. \n\nThey change the menu really frequently, so the dishes that I'm listing below probably won't be on the menu any longer, but it will give you an example of some of the things that you may find there.\n\nAppetizers:\n\n- Chicory Lyonnaise - This was a chicory salad with bacon, a poached egg, pepitas, with a sherry vinaigrette. Who doesn't like bacon and a runny egg with salad? It's delicious!\n- Roasted Tomato Soup - This was good, but tomato soup is not one of my favorites soups.\n- Smoked Salmon - This was served with rye crisps, some lettuce, and cucumber. The amount of salmon was a little bit on the skimpy side.\n\nEntrees:\n\n- Striped Bass - The sea bass was pan-fried, with rock shrimp, served atop risotto. The fish was fresh, the risotto was delicious, and it was all great. I always love all their seafood dishes. You can't go wrong.\n- Pan Roasted Scallops - Usually one scallop dish will run you $25, so I was really happy to find this was included in one of my prix fixe menus. It was perfectly cooked, served on top of corn, shishito peppers. Delicious and highly recommend if they ever bring it back!\n\nPastas ($10 per plate):\n\n- Mushroom Pappardelle - With prosciutto, parmesan cream sauce, and truffle butter, this was delicious. The noodles were al dente and the cream sauce was one that you wouldn't just be able to find anywhere.\n- Garganelli Bolognese - Served with buratta, and a bolognese sauce, this was one of my favorites. I preferred this to the mushroom pappardelle, but I've never been disappointed with any of their pastas. You can't go wrong.\n- Shortrib Ravoli - Delicious, and served with a horseradish sauce. If they have this, you should get it as - this combination of pasta + meat + sauce can't be found at a lot of other places. \n\nDesserts:\n\n- Passionfruit Cake - I love anything with passionfruit, so this as great. Little triangles of soft passionfruit cake, with interesting basil seeds on top for some crunch and texture, and with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. I always love all their desserts here.\n- Brown Butter Financier - This was a deconstructed dessert served with lemon curd, blackberry compote, and vanilla ice cream. I normally love chocolate desserts over non-chocolate ones, but when my Mom ordered this one and I ordered the chocolate pot de creme, I wanted to trade. This was light, citrusy, and a delicious combination of flavors.\n- Chocolate Pot de Creme - Served with bourbon whipped cream and an orange-almond streusel, this was rich, decadent, and delicious.\n\nOne of the best places to eat in the city. Nice ambiance, modern decor, good service, and a 3-course prix fixe price that can't be beat. One of my favorites!", "author": "Christina L."}

Decisions are easier and you can bank on the fact the back of house knows what it's doing, making the quality dishes, over and over again. Portions are just right. If you add a 4th course, only do 1 order and split. The 3 courses by themselves are plenty in quality and quantity. Also, ask for an order of the complimentary, lovely grilled bread with soft butter (finally, a restaurant who gets it right when offering butter that is actually spreadable and not too cold!).\n\nBeverages - solid selection, nice to see classics from France!

The menu is ever-changing, so it's possible to frequent Trestle and not get bored.  \n\nThe tastes were split during our visit, so our table sampled EVERY SINGLE dish offered that night.  SCORE!! Trestle offers bonus pasta dishes for the table; we ordered both options for ours.\n\nThe dishes we tasted were:\ngem salad\nclam chowder\nenglish pea risotto (bonus)\ngarganelli bolognese \nsalmon\nshort ribs\nchocolate brownie\npeaches and cream\n\nThis is how much I like Trestle:  I visited 6 days ago and I have a reservation to visit tomorrow night with a new group.", "author": "Andrea H."}

I was anticipating this meal for a few weeks as it would be our second pre-fix meal as a couple. \n\nwe showed up 5 minutes early and stood in the doorway for that time and a few extra minutes. not a serious issue but something to mention. I believe something like a complimentary flute of Andre, or some rose` would be a nice gesture whilst forced to wait standing around looking akward. \n\nthe vast majority of the 4 course meal was pleasant and interesting. we noticed a few items being used on separate courses. like orange wedges and lemon. the bitter aspect of taste was over done over the top. I believe the very bitter elements ruined the crab hush puppies. (only 2, 1oz balls....maybe 3-4 plz!)\n\nthe pasta dishes were very well played and also extremely tasty. 5 pieces of \"gnudi\" a gnocchish cheesy ball of awesomeness! We wanted a few more cause they were delish! \n\nNow for the only dish we disagreed on. The Crispy seared fish(believe grouper) was surprisingly chewy and tendon-like. Needed a steak knife with a good cerated edge to cut the chunky white flesh. I've cooked a lot and ordered a number of fish dishes in the past and have not experienced chewy fish like this before. I almost question the species being grouper..... Maybe carp? My girlfriend is a 26yr old Philippino woman and she enjoys a range of textures and flavors that I struggle with.... I just don't want to struggle with my fish.....The 2 piece steak option was mind bogglingly good. I've never had such a tender ny strip. Maybe dry aged I suspect.\n\nDessert was a tarletet(micro and skimpy on chocolate ganache) . Also some \"elevated fried dough\" basically state Fair donuts with some jam.\n\nAll in all I was disappointed for spending $80/meal+$40(bottle vino)+20%tip=$255..... Im not one to usually spend boocoo bucks for a meal and now I remember why. We like to relax and enjoy a meal that we didnt slave over cause we do that err day of the week. I know when I'm cooking food for others or myself I use the best possible ingredients and make them to the best of my abilities, if your cooking and not doing that then please let the devotes step in. They might be the young person working really hard as a dish washer. They need to earn thier place but don't slow them down. I worked every position at a steak+seafood place(ties required). From dish washer-lead tableside flambe and rib carver. When my boss slowed me down to become a server I put in my two weeks. He offered me a raise and told me I was always welcome to eat there or work for him. \n\nNow I see the benefits I earned from my time as a service provider. I now can not handle being in that industry. I am a Land Surveyor, enjoy my outdoor office and the quiet times alone drafting. Dealing with an irate adjoiner is another animal all together. Time for that later.\n\nAll in all I realized the mistake is mine. I saw the price on the menu and proceeded to partake (my fault) I just need to not over-extend my expectations.\n\nOn the other hand I've and food from small restaurants that over shadowed this food by long shots and offered more reasonable prices.", "author": "Eli B."}

Luckily, the restaurant was very accommodating - while they offered to make me a special entree not on the menu, I opted to sub in the Pasta course as my main.

A lot of prefix meals can set you back a couple hundred dollars per person, but at Trestle you can get a 3 course meal for $45 and for an additional $10 you can get a 4 course meal. For me personally, 3 courses was plenty of food, but for those bigger eaters out there, go for 4 courses. You will not be disappointed. Their pastas were spot on and probably some of my favorite dishes of the night. Since I went with a couple people, we got to try everything on the menu and here were our picks of the night (I forgot the exact names of the dishes, so I'll just go with general descriptions): \n\nTomato tart with goat cheese (5/5) vs corn soup (2/5): The tomato tart was one of the best things of the night. It was the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and tart. The tomatoes were gently roasted. The goat cheese added lovely hints of tang. Tart itself was crispy, buttery, and flaky. As for the corn soup, we all thought it was nothing special. A+ for presentation, but tasted like plain corn soup. None of the toppings (avocado mouse, radish slices, egg yolk) added to the flavor of the soup.\n\nChorizo and squid risotto (4/5) vs mushroom cannoli (5/5): Both the \"pasta\" dishes were really good. My friends preferred the risotto due to the balance of flavors, but I personally love mushrooms, so the cannoli wins it for me. The mushrooms were earthy and delicious. Cannoli filling was smooth and creamy. Peas and arugula added a touch of freshness. Perfection!\n\nCurry trout (2/5) vs beef shoulder (4/5): Trout is usually a huge hit or miss for me. The trout here was a miss. The curry didn't add anything to the dish and the trout itself lacked flavor. Tomato relish was the star of the dish for me, which, is sad considering the trout was supposed to shine. I also was greatly saddened by the difference in portion size between the 2 dishes. Unlike the small filet of trout, the beef dish came with a generous hunk of beautifully braised beef shoulder, as well as a side of potatoes and salad. Every element on that plate meshed well together. Would definitely order this again next time. \n\nPrickly pear cactus donuts (2/5) vs chocolate boudino (4/5): The donuts were nothing special. The glaze was supposed to contain hibiscus and prickly pear, but neither flavors really stood out to me. The donuts were on the dense side and basically didn't taste like anything. Chocolate boudino on the other hand was delicious. Rich, velvety chocolate topped with some vanilla whipped cream and poached pear slices. Only part I didn't like was the cornbread croutons on top. Although the dish did need a crunch factor, the cornbread croutons just tasted weird and mealy to me. Could have done with a shortbread cookie crumble or a tuile instead.\n\nPros: \n- Very affordably priced prefix dinner (great for people who want to feel fancy, but don't want to pay the $$$$ price tag for it)\n- Fresh and innovative dish ideas that worked well together for the most part \n- Pretty easy to get a reservation if you book a week or two in advance\n- Great service, staff were all very attentive\n\nCons: \n- Hard to find parking \n- Pick and choose your dishes wisely because some are really a hit or a miss", "author": "Diana C."}

Food wise, $35 for a 3 course meal sounds like a fantastic deal but is it really? Aren't dine about town prices the same for a prix fixe dinner? If you add another pasta dish, it's $10 more.The dishes are also smaller than normal but you do get full so prices aside, let's talk about the food. \n\nThe wine and beer menu is extensive! I totally dig that, and according to the article, wines are mostly under $50 which is a great deal. I had a sour beer myself and that was $10. It's great to go with another person so you can order all of the options then share them. \n\nCalamari starter- great flavors! You can add a pasta dish for $10 so of course we got both options. The ravioli was meaty and good with a great texture of sausage, the other one was mashed potato (corrected By Matthew K. It's risotto, that's how mushy it was) with prosciutto which was just ok. The beef short rib were well done but I wasn't a big fan of the fish- branzino. And lastly, the dessert: you can't go wrong with either one!! The strawberry rhubarb stood out to me and the chocolate one was great to have in between. The desserts reminded me of Stones Throw because that was also my most memorable part of the meal (and those potato balls!) \n\nThis is a great addition to the neighborhood and a great experience and date night spot! I thought the food was A-ok, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends who are coming to SF. It's more a weeknight dinner spot to try out.", "author": "Joanna S."}

You can totally start the night off with drinks at any of the bars in North Beach, then make your way to Trestle for a 3 course meal, and resume partying it up in North Beach. \n\nI didn't like our waitress tho. She was attentive but a bit too eager. She came to clear our plates before we finished our food.....there was still food on our plates and she wanted to take the plates away. What? No. Anyway....\n\nAbout the food -- \n\n- Firebrand Bread: SO DELICIOUS. (TIP - each table can ask for 2 orders.... I recommend getting your first order with the SOUP, and second order with your entree). \n- Appetizer: Butternut Squash Soup. This week, the featured appetizers were either a butternut squash soup or salad (duck liver mousse, candied peanuts, persimmon). I opted for the soup because it was a cold evening and there is nothing better to get you feeling all warmed up than a bowl of soup! \n- Pasta: this is $10 add on. Please do it. Order it for yourself or at least share it with the table. The portion is pretty small (fair) so will leave you room for the main course and dessert. We ordered the bolognese, made with fresh basil! The other choice tonight was mushroom risotto, which I am sure is excellent as well. \n-Main: The two choices were crispy-skin salmon & fried quail. I ordered the salmon, which came with creamy farro (yuuuummmmmyyyy), brussels sprouts, and candied black walnuts. \n-Dessert: chocolate mousse :) with creme fraiche and plums :) \n\nReservation: I made the reservation for two at 6 pm on a Wednesday night about two weeks out.", "author": "Dana Z."}

We tried to make reservations on-line the same day, but had to leave a message at the restaurant. Brittany called back quickly, and was able to fit us in close to our requested time. And then later accommodated us when our timing changed. \n\nIt was one of the most enjoyable meals we've had. Anywhere. The food preparation, presentation and service were all impeccable. Since the menu changes daily there's not much point in reciting it, and there are plenty of pictures you can drool over, so we won't contribute any of those. The crowd (no Santas) was mostly what you expect in SF - young professionals. (That doesn't describe us; we were certainly the oldest ones in the room.) The noise level was also what you expect - loud, but not so loud that you couldn't talk. In fact, we had nice conversations with our server, Danielle, and hostess Brittany, notwithstanding the sound level.  \n\nWe've had dinner a couple of times at The French Laundry over several years, and it always lived up to it's reputation: outstanding sophistication in food prep and service. We enjoyed it very much as a bucket-list kind of experience. Food and service? More sophisticated at TFL, but not by a whole lot, and Trestle was much more comfortable.  We both prefer Trestle; it's a lot more fun. And that's without comparing the prix fixe of $35 at Trestle against $340-350 at TFL. Go figure. Go to Trestle. \n\n(If you've got an expense account, a yearning to be able to say you've gone to TFL, want an excuse to come to the Wine Country, and can get a reservation, go to TFL.

Very solid, high quality food. Atmosphere is chill, a little dim and casual. It's an incredibly reasonable price for value here (3 course prix fixe at $35) and I'm glad a place like this can exist in SF. 4.5 rounded down.\n\nFalafel Salad w/ Crispy Lavash, Cucumber, Tzatziki Mint\nA tasty light starter. There were 4 small falafel balls which were soft and on the mushier rather than crispy side. The texture was finer grained and smoother as if they used milled chickpea flour and not as coarse as your usual falafel. Served sweet pickled cucumber slices and peppers and crunchy lavash chips\n\nPan Roasted Ocean Trout - Salt Baked Beets, Horseradish, Barley, Parslane\nFish was cooked perfectly, succulent and not the least bit overdone. Grated horseradish was memorable and the barely in the creamy sauce was incredible. Beets and some small piles of spinach to the side.\n\nThe dessert was somewhat of a let down.\nChocolate Devil's Food Cake w/ Honey-Milk Chocolate Pudding, Black Figs, Honeycomb\nHoney punctuated the cake. There were 3 small bits of chocolate cake, light, not dense. Chocolate flavor was one dimensional and not particularly interesting. The chocolate pudding dollops on the side were really sweet, creamy and milky - the opposite of what I like of chocolate but might be your thing if you're a milk chocolate person. Figs were nice garnish but not particularly flavorful.\n\nWhite Peony Custard w/ Quince Puree, Granny Smith Apples, Pomegranate\nThis was the better of the two desserts. Custard was a bit eggy and had a good firm texture. The ingredients perfectly complemented each other. Sweetness, mellowness and texture of the quince puree were balanced by the tart small chunks of apples and pomegranate seeds.\n\nService was okay and prompt.", "author": "Truc N."}

I just had to find an occasion and the boy bestie's birthday was coming up so I booked a table for his birthday. I know it's a bit selfish to go to a place I wanted to go to, but he is always down to try places. Eventually, I'll get him to a Michelin starred place, but that's a story for another day. \n\nThe meal changes often so what I've tasted may not be on the menu for the day, but their dishes are great. \n\nWe started off with a calamari and smoked fingerling potato and the asparagus soup. Out of the two, I think my favorite was the asparagus soup. It was nice and refreshing and the shaved asparagus was a great texture against the soup. Also delicious croutons.  The calamari was deliciously fried and the harissa aoili was delicious, I just don't like olives and there was an abundance of them. You know the Olive Theory? (from How I Met Your Mother - it's true between him and me, except we won't make a good couple). \n\nThe pork and pea risotto was next and oh yes. I loved it! I love a great risotto and the small bites of ham and peas in it gave elevated it since I could get it all in one bite. \n\nOur main courses was a crispy skin snapper and the sausage stuffed roasted chicken. Now my chicken was not sausage stuffed (or at least I couldn't tell), but it was still deliciously moist. The foie gras farro that came with it was probably my favorite thing. The snapper was pretty good, but the rromesco sauce was spicy and paired well with the dish. \n\nFinally dessert - I'm so happy I told them it was his birthday because one of the two desserts came out with a candle! The passionfruit cake was amazing and I loved the pieces of dragonfruit. The hot cocoa custard was an interest twist, but my favorite part of the dish was the candied kumquats.

Here it's 3 courses for $35 or 4 for $45. The only problem I do see is that the choices are very limited. If you happen to not like either option, you might just be out of luck. For example, the entrees when I went was branzino or beef short rib. What if I don't eat red meat and fish? A third option would be nice but I understand to keep costs low and the business profitable, they have to maintain a small menu. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small. I do wish tables were not as close to each other but besides that the space is very well designed. I love the wood and exposed bricks with modern touches.\n\nFor only having been opened for 3 days, the service was smooth and flawless. They were always checking up on us and we never had to ask for anything. If I didn't know better, I would have thought they been opened for a long time just from how well our dinner went.\n\nThe meal I had here was better than my meal at Stones Throw (their sister restaurant). I only wished they would have offered some house bread between the time that we ordered and the first course.\n\nNon-alcoholic drinks were limited. We ordered a coke and it came in a small glass bottle which was enough for one glass. It was $4. It didn't quite fit the \"value\" theme but I guess they have to make money from somewhere. \n\nParking in the area is not too difficult. Stones Throw is in a much more difficult area to park so I'm glad they didn't stick to that area. After 6pm all the meter spots open up especially in the financial district area just a couple blocks down.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered the entire menu. It was fun to have a total of eight different dishes to try. Value is certainly there but don't expect to get out for less than $100 for dinner for two.\n\nThe menu changes very often and not posted on their website until day of so you can't exactly plan ahead.

Our dinner group of six made Trestle our group dinner on a recent Friday night at 6:15pm.\n\nUpon checking in with the hostess, we were promptly seated in the front of the restaurant.  The restaurant is quaint with modern touches with about 14 or so tables.  The menu is a simple price-fixed menu for $35 a person, which includes an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert.  You can add $10 for a pasta supplement. The diner is given an option of two choices for each course.  Grilled French bread with butter is served upon request.  Bread was so crispy and tasty.\n\nOur choices this evening were:\nAppetizers:\nLittle Gem Salad with avocado puree, lavash, Ni\u00e7oise olive vinaigrette. Beautifully presented.  Was tasty. \n\nBroccoli Soup - ricotta dumpling, pickle kohlrabi, chili jam.  The soup was poured at the table into the bowl consisting of the kohlrabi and chili jam.\n \nPasta Supplement:\nGarganelli Bolognese with burrata, basil, Calabrian chili oil. Good, but preferred the pappardelle.\n\nPappardelle Carbonara with Maitake mushroom, soft poached egg, parmesan. This pasta was so delicious. The mushrooms and egg made it so tasty and rich. \n\nEntrees:\nCrispy-Skin Striped Bass with petite pois, spiced dashi, calamari.  Bass was moist and the broth was flavorful\n\nParmesan-Crusted Braised Beef Short rib with French onion broth, farro, shave asparagus. This was a rich and hearty entr\u00e9e.  \n\nDesserts:\nCitrus Chamomile Custard with quince puree, pomegranate seeds, granny smith apples\nChai Chocolate Mousse with cardamom mascarpone, poached Bosc pears, cocoa nibs\n\nBoth desserts were light and nicely presented.\n\nOur waitress was engaging, attentive and friendly. At $35 a person for three courses and an extra $10 for the pasta supplement, this is a true value for the quality of food at the edge of the financial district.

Worth a try.\n\n***\n\nFirst, my kudos to Trestle for incredibly smart marketing. $35 for a pre fixe meal sounds too good to be true. Rest assured, you will end up spending more $ than you think, I can almost guarantee it. I willfully submit to over indulging at Trestle bc it's part of the experience. Do you have to get a bottle of wine and a supplemental pasta dish? Absolutely not. Will you? Of course you will, silly!\n\nRegardless, Trestle offers tasty and interesting food with their ever changing menu. You don't know what's being served up, until the day of, just like it was in Mom's kitchen.

With the bonus pasta, the three-course meal is very filling for a party of 2.\n\nI opted to get one of each of the items on the menu (only of the pastas) for my party of 2.  I preferred the salad VS the potato soup, the salad was very well balanced between fresh and tangy VS the creamy and filling texture of the soup.  The skin on the salmon was charred to perfection, seriously well done.  And by the time dessert came by, we were already pretty full...\n\nOverall, the food is fantastic, very solid, the service is exceptional, a cozy yet spacious atmosphere which makes for a great fine dining experience.  This may not be my go-to but I would definitely go again.  Great spot for a date or catching up with a group of friends.  They serve beer & wine.\n\nDo make reservations ahead of time.  If they do not offer you your ideal time slot, let the host know and they can put you on the wait list for an earlier time slot, they are fairly accommodating.

They're pretty small but have a good number of seating for their size. They have wooden tables and chairs, very antique and rustic like feel. Dim lighting for that mood setting.

I got the dry cider which was slightly sweet and refreshing, just what I wanted. For appetizers, we got the wild mushroom risotto and red kuri squash soup. I normally don't like squash soup but this was delicious. And you just can't go wrong with risotto. For entrees, we got the pan seared scallops and the garganelli bolognese (we paid the additional $3 to substitute for an entree). The scallops were perfected seared and had great flavor without being overseasoned and salty. The garganelli bolognese was the star of the night. Perfectly al denta pasta noodles with that fresh delicious burratta and the sauce didn't overpower the cheese or the noodles. Perfection with each bite. For dessert, we got the chocolate tart and the persimmon cake. I really enjoyed the persimmon cake, it really had a complexity of flavors that complimented each other so well.\n\nService was awesome! Our server went into detail about how the prix fixe menu works and informed us about pasta substitute.

Should you have been a waiter or a cook before you're allowed to eat out?\n\nSpeaking just to the last, I'd dare to say ... perhaps.  There are some who might stumble on this that I've seen out and about who I would like few things more than to take your fine-coiffed self straight back to the kitchen to get your dishes on.  Then the next night you could run me a little food. Then the day after learn what in the weeds really means, all the while taking home a hundred clams a night for your trouble.  \n\nAnd then, after that, I'd take you to Trestle.\n\nBecause you'd have been good and now you get it a little more than before and now, ami, you'll be in the proper frame of mind to appreciate something truly special.  You'll know because you'll have had first-hand experience that the front of the house here is genuine and truly wants your experience to be memorable.  That the folks who clear and fill your water aren't invisible and work very hard.  That the people in back, the ones you don't see, find their work interesting and enjoyable and sometimes peek out to see if you're smiling because they really try to turn the corners of your mouth in a pretty way and when they do they're happy inside.\n\nThe menu at Trestle is always different, and this makes it easier for me presently because unlike lapin I rarely make a mental note of what I've eaten and now I kind of feel it's ok to have nothing in particular to regale you with here.  I'm a big picture kind of fellow.  But the big picture is made up of the little details and if one of them is out of place the big picture is as well.  \n\nHere, at Trestle, nothing was out of place.  From start to finish, every detail was perfect.  I think you should go.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Markus N."}

But was it exactly $35.. possibly, if you stuck to the menu without add ons and drinks. I made a reservation in advance, but it was for 2 people and we didn't mind going on an off day, so it wasn't too hard to find an agreeable dinner time. \n\nI want to say first that their service is outstanding. They certainly pay attention to you and your needs as a customer, refilling water, changing plates, folding your napkin - I felt valued and am satisfied with my dining experience in that sense. \n\nIf you come with another person, just try all 6 items on there, I think it's perfect! They have a rotating menu, so it's nice to try new things. Their butternut squash was very creamy and I loved the bits of squash and nuts added in. Their salad had a nice citrus vinaigrette. They offer supplemental pasta for $10, so we ordered a mushroom risotto which was pretty heavy on the cream and cheese. The main courses were a sea bass and pork schneitzel. The pork schneitzel didn't stand out to me because it just tasted like a pork tonkatsu. The sea bass was very fresh! To finish off the night, the two desserts included a fruity berry cake with ice cream and chocolate devils food cake, so it really was just the best of both worlds. \n\nI'd certainly recommend this quaint and cozy restaurant to others!

I have to say...the pasta was REALLY good!!! I don't even like pastas usually, but the pasta at Trestle is divine!! What I love most about Trestle is that there's an element of surprise in each dish. I had the corn chowder. In the beginning I thought it was just sweet corn chowder which is really good...but I get these very light kick of spiciness to it with some bites and was surprised. I think after dining out so much these days...alot of food at restaurants are good and yummy, but it starts to get boring because it's not surprising anymore. Trestle is full of surprises. What looks like a normal pasta has a bit of crunch to it, and the fish for the main dish tastes really good with the rice and special sauce on the side. Desserts were really yummy too. I wanted to take photos, but it was a bit dark at dinner to take a great photo, so I decided not to and enjoy my food instead.

Keeping things affordable is always great.\n\nTrestle has got the fine dining model right, by providing a fine dining experience for those who are on a budget. I made reservations with Christine C. and Allen C. months in advance to secure a premium 6 pm time slot on a Friday. The wait list can attest to their popularity.\n\nAs we walked through the doors of this fine establishment, I knew we were in for a treat. The interior had a rustic feel with trestles running along the brick walls up to the roof. Looking further on the white walls, there are elegant gold foil patterns that compliments the flower arrangements at the center of the room. Loving this place already.\n\nThe menu is simple. A $35 prix fixe meal for an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. There is also a $10 pasta course addition for the carb lovers and diners who have a larger stomach. There are only two choices for each dish, but the menu changes daily, so you'll have a different food experience every time. We got at least one of every dish since we couldn't decide.\n\n// Appetizer \n- Falafel Salad: the Falafel was fried nicely and most inside. It felt more like a deconstructed Falafel sandwich with out the pita than a salad, but the fresh vegetables and tzatziki made this dish great.\n\n- Carrot Ginger Soup - this soup screamed carrot from the carrot puree soup base, to its carrot cake croutons and carrot top pesto. If you are in love with carrots, you will fall in love with this soup.\n\n// Pasta\n-Mushroom Risotto: We only ordered this dish to make sure we had room for the other dishes. This dish was made with king trumpet Mushrooms, upland cress and shaved Parmesan. I could not get enough of this dish! This is a must have if you are a fan of savory.\n\n// Entree\n- Braised Short Ribs: A melt in your mouth shortribs Braised in a delicious sauce reduction over a bed of farro and broccoli rabe. \n\n- Pan Seared Scallops - these were the star of the night! Two big Scallops pillows with crispy leeks, vadouvan, and squash. Trestle does seafood right.\n\n//Dessert\n- Chocolate Devil's Food Cake: Honey Milk Chocolate Pudding, Honey Combs and black mission figs. This cake is rich ($$$$). This is only for those who have a big sweet tooth. \n\n-Huckleberry Coffee Cake: Espresso Struesel, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Mint. This is a refreshing touch to the end of the meal. Loved everything about this dish.\n\nThe night was perfect. We received Michelin Star service for a fraction of the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-28", "description": "Trestle is definitely worth a try. You have to be ok with the prix fixe concept, but at $35 per person it isn't a huge gamble. You'll need to reserve a spot days/weeks in advance, but the menu won't be revealed until the night before your meal. So, if you (or your date) are picky you might look elsewhere. One thing is certain, you'll be treated to a well executed dinner with expert, albeit a bit over-rehearsed, service.\n\nThis is a relatively small space, at an uncharacteristically affordable price, so they do seem to encourage churn. We had concert plans later in the evening, so weren't bothered by the pace.\n\nWe liked, but perhaps didn't love, everything we were served. The sunchoke soup was nice, and the arctic char was expertly prepared with a crisp skin and tender and juicy medium rare on the filet. My wife opted to select the risotto as her main course though it probably is best served (as intended) as a pasta course. It lacked the flavor and complexity to stand on its own. Desserts were well presented and a perfect portion for one.\n\nTrestle is a nice option if you're looking for a quality meal, at an affordable price point, with attentive service...and particularly attractive if you're on a schedule.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-26", "description": "We went to Trestle with high hopes - for the most part it delivered, although there were a couple kinks that I think they should rectify in the future. \n\nFirst point: Chinese Chicken Salad or Tortilla Soup as appetizers. If this had been Applebees, I wouldn't have batted an eye, but this is supposed to be a really special restaurant, and I was sorta disappointed with these offerings. The Tortilla soup was fine, but it wasn't awesome, and felt disconnected from the rest of the meal. Maybe these were \"ironic\" dishes but I wasn't getting it. \n\nSecond: I am long accustomed to being asked what type of water I want...the standard is for restaurants to offer premium still or sparkling waters first, and wait for you to say you want \"regular\" or tap water. Let's face it - this is always awkward for everyone, and not saying that it's been solved yet as a dining conversation. However, in this case, the server asks whether we wanted \"regular\" water - sparkling or still. The \"-\" is the way I heard the question. I assume by his leading with \"regular\" that they don't charge for water, and like many places, they offer either still or sparkling at no additional charge. We were a party of three, and he brought out two bottles. For a second I thought to ask, but again, assumed based on the language used that these were on the house. He served one, and then immediately opened the second since he poured the first one out completely. So not only did we not align on this being premium water, he made the decision to charge us for two bottles since in his determination we were so thirsty that we wanted a second bottle without asking for it (had these been free, of course, what the hell did I care!) But they weren't free, and that's the disconnect. They should make it clear these are not free by asking in a much clearer way, and they should ask if you want another bottle before opening and pouring a second. \n\nThese issues alone aren't enough to dissuade me from going back, assuming they are rectified - I just wanted to pass along this info so you are able to check out the menu beforehand,  and ensure you are clear you are paying for water.", "author": "Nick S."}

It was good, but did not taste much different from any creamed corn soup you can blend yourself or get out of a can.  \n\nThe pork schnitzel was basically a Japanese tonkatsu pork cutlet you can get with a Japanese bento box.  It used the Japanese breading instead of what you would expect since they used the German term schnitzel.  \n\nThe short rib ravioli was unremarkable, but this $10 supplement was necessary because the other 3 courses would not have been enough food for $35.  \n\nI thought the chocolate bananas foster was solid.  The ice cream was not too sweet, which complemented the chocolate, which was more rich than I personally prefer.  \n\nAll in all, it was a fairly priced $45 meal for the ambiance of eating out, but the food was not particularly well executed.

It was good and the dressing was especially refreshing and went very well with the calamari. \n\nWe also ordered the saffron risotto to share for an additional $10. It was rich, creamy and I really enjoyed it. \n\nThe entree was more disappointing though. The braised beef short ribs were just unremarkably average, one of those dishes where it didn't taste bad, but does not wow you either. The sea bass with couscous was the same; you just can't really go wrong with sea bass as long as they cook it correctly. The skin was crispy and the fish and it was good and all, but after the very good appetizer and pasta, the entrees were underwhelming, especially as they were much smaller than expected. \n\nI had the dark chocolate tart for dessert and that was absolutely wonderful. This dish combined hazelnuts, earl grey and a dark chocolate cream together for a mouthful of flavour. The soft bittersweet cream contrasted with the tart crust and the hard hazelnut bits and was easily my favourite dish from the night. My friend had the Pumpkin panna cotta, which was very pretty but definitely more average. \n\nThe ambiance at Trestle is excellent. It's a very intimate setting with high ceilings and was very well decorated. The dishes were all plated beautifully and service was great. Entree wasn't the best but the other dishes were all quite good and somewhat made up for it. I was expecting more so it was underwhelming but for the number of courses and the price, Trestle offers good value. Given the price and quality, Trestle definitely stands as a more affordable fancy dinner place with friends.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

(http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg) and Vicky L. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M271Ac7UKVaQ9U5AOvc_9A) wrote about it, I was anxious to give this a try.  A friend called me out of the blue and invited me to dinner without naming the place until I picked her up.  You know where it was... hence, here we go.  We score rock star parking around the corner on Kearny Street as it reverts to regular street parking after 6 pm.  We were seated at the second table from the door which proved convenient since I'm not a small guy.  The menu is straightforward with a three-course menu for $35.00 as mentioned by everyone who wrote about this place.  There are two choices to each category including a pasta supplement section.  I'm confident that they would customize dishes based on food allergies and dietary restrictions, but you might want to call to make sure; you might do the same if you are picky about the menu.  After our kind waitress recommended a beer from Oklahoma for my gracious host, we ordered our meals and here's what I tried:\n\nAppetizer\n1) Little Gem salad (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=uPqqWDM0v0k6N_BaknizYw) -  Sounds healthy, until I busted that egg to make it runny, a perfect accompaniment to those pork belly chunks (aka bacon?).\n\nPastas, both shared at $10.00 supplement per\n2) Ravioli (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=JgQmAKNyLX0qz2iO-7EdQA) - A very NorCal dish with the in-season English peas and a light sauce.  Not my favorite.\n\n3) Mushroom Risotto (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=K6DgVcXJRQYYsYQ6eHvd6A) - Our table's favorite dish, the earthy mushrooms paired well with the rich yet not too mushy risotto.  No question, we both wanted seconds on this one!\n\nEntr\u00e9e\n4) Beef shortrib (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=dTxt2S1jiAf5iy_t8OnD2g) - This was tender, as in you don't need a knife, and braised nicely with flavors infused into the meat.  It's too bad that none of the other ingredients on the plate really stand out.\n\nDessert\n5) Chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Innocent looking, but the whiskey infused whipped cream gave this a kick!  \n\nMy companion gave me a spoonful of her corn soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=D1r-tGIwEkG5YPugnP2wqg), which she dubbed her second favorite dish of the meal; it was sweet and you can taste the freshness of the local corn. \nPlease note that the dining room is on the small side and the tables are pretty tightly arranged so the noise level can get loud; again, luckily, we were closer to the entrance so it wasn't as bad.  Our waitress was great in explaining the menu and making recommendations.  The runners were very responsive to refilling drink glasses and fulfilling our utensil requests.  \nAt $35.00 per meal, especially in San Francisco, this is a bargain considering the caliber of the cooking and food.  The food rates 4.5 stars as it just  isn't quite the best I've had.  Boosting up 0.5 star for the service and affordability.  Will be back.", "author": "Mike C."}

Honestly, as delicious as my meal was in itself, I think I could have been just as happy if only served bread the entire night.\n\nGoing to Trestle is, as Forrest would describe it, like a box of chocolates. Because the $35pp menu changes daily, you never know what you're going to get. But, based on everything we had that night, I think you're golden regardless.\n\nOur menu consisted of:\n\nApps:\n- Applewood Smoked Salmon\n- Roasted Tomato Soup\n\nPastas (extra $10 each and well worth it):\n- Corn Risotto\n- Garganelli Bolognese\u00a0\n\nEntrees:\n- Crispy Skin Branzino\n- Sausage-stuffed Roast Quail\n\nDesserts:\n- Brown Butter Financier\n- Chocolate Pot de Creme\n\nMy favorites, besides the bread of course, were the pasta courses. With the success of Trestle, perhaps Stones Throw ought to seek a pasta eatery opening next.\n\nService was super friendly and attentive; our water glasses were never left empty, and food arrived fairly quickly.

Three courses for $35 ands $10 supplement for pasta - each course is pretty substantial (not to mention delicious). \n\nFor the courses, there was a choice between corn soup or tomato salad (I chose corn soup), short rib with farro or salmon (I chose short rib) and I asked if I could do my third course as pasta instead of dessert. Yes, with a $3 additional supplement...100% worth it! The pasta choice was between a bolognese (similar to a penne) and a mushroom risotto - bolognese all the way and I had no regrets. Meaty and rich, I was not sharing this with my friend. The server was surprised we were each getting our own pastas...it is definitely worth it to not share!\n\nI love the way they have their wine list divided between \"affordable\" wines and splurges. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small so the quarters are tight; if you're looking for an intimate and quiet dinner, this probably isn't the place for you. \n\nService was on the slow side - it took our plates longer to get cleared than the people who sat next to us...and they arrived 20-30 min after us. Otherwise, an amazing deal for some top-notch eats.", "author": "Wendy L."}

My BF and I shared every plate and they were all fantastic!\n\nReservations: We made reservations for 2 about a month in advanced.

My observation told me that any walk ins around that time would be seated within 15-20 minutes.\n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is small but very lively. It is bright, clean and comfortable. Service is fast (probably because of limited meal options).\n\nPrice: for a $$$ ranking this restaurant is the best deal I have experienced in San Francisco. the fixed price is 35 with the option to add another course for 10 more dollars.

Went there for the first time a month or so ago and four amazing courses later, I have to say that Trestle really earned each and everyone of those stars. This is about as good as it gets in SF, especially for price vs. quality. \n\nThe restaurant has a $35 3-course prix fixe menu (+$10 extra pasta course) that changes daily with two choices for each course. I love this concept because it really allows the restaurant to really focus on the quality of the ingredients and the construction of their dishes. \n\n-Cream of leek soup (w/ crispy potato, bacon, chives) -5/5\n-Garganelli bolognese (w/ burrata, basil, calabrian chili oil) - 5/5\n-Crispy skin striped bass (w/ curried brussel sprouts, cauliflower) - 4/5\n-White pepper financier (w/ figs, candied walnuts, vanilla ice cream) - 3/5 \n\nI definitely recommend adding the pasta course, particularly if the bolognese above appears on your menu. The combination of burrata cheese and calabrian chili oil is heavenly. This was possibly the best bolognese I've ever had in my life (and I'm a big fan of Italian food). The cream of leek soup was also outstanding. I wasn't expecting much from it, but the combination of the crispy potato and bacon flavor was just fantastic. Dessert was the weak note of the evening as I wasn't wild about the white pepper financier, which I thought was a bit plain after all of the outstanding food combinations from the first three courses. \n\nDecor is chic and service is outstanding. My friend accidentally made a reservation on the wrong date and they were able to squeeze us in even with a full restaurant. \n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Barbara B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-29", "description": "4.5 stars but rounding up. Delicious food for an amazing value in this day and age, with wonderful service to boot! I was able to score last minute reservations (I think someone cancelled) for a party of 4 at 6pm on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived, but we were seated right away. It's $35/person for a 3 course meal, with an optional $10 supplement/person for an additional pasta dish. There are two choices for each course, so a friend and I decided to order the opposite dish so that we could try everything on the menu. We also ordered 2 pasta dishes for 5 girls, and this was more than enough food for our group. We tried:\n\n-Appetizers: Little Gem Salad (Crispy Bacon, Poached Egg, Dijon Vinaigrette) & English Pea \"Chowder\" (Smoked Salmon, Mint, Potato) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4Lbonfy71qLTpvTh74hxDw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg][http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4Lbonfy71qLTpvTh74hxDw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: I'm not a big soup person so liked the gem salad more since it's hard to mess up a salad with crispy bacon and a poached egg. The \"chowder\" was very thick and chock full of ingredients- it was too heavy on the potato for my liking, and I thought the smoked salmon was a bit strange in it. However, the english pea soup part was super fresh tasting and really good.\n-Pastas, Addt'l $10 Supplement: Polenta Agnolotti (Roasted Corn, Pickled Red Onions, Arugula) & Squid Ink Conchiglie (Clams, Calamari, Piri Piri Chili, Greens) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=R7D5ioLd8cp1rm4LY1l5dw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: We were all surprised that we liked the polenta agnolotti more, which was delicious with the sweetness of the roasted corn. The conchiglie was a little too salty, and we didn't like the flavors in that dish as much. However, both pastas tasted super fresh, and the texture was amazing- the pasta is definitely a must try!\n-Crispy Skin Branzino (Fregola, Olive Tapenade, Grilled Radicchio, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pCM_SaroV6tffpqGWynhYg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): A bit disappointing- the branzino was fresh, and the skin was crispy, but the fish itself was overcooked and dry/tough. We also didn't like the fregola and olive tapenade combination- this dish was a miss for us.\n-Braised Beef Short Ribs (Asparagus, Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Sauce Choron, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rpuDjtZeyHXdaPjIsmbwUA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good, but the short rib wasn't as tender as we expected. It also needed a bit more sauce. This dish was ok, but definitely could be improved.\n-Desserts: Blackberry Hand Pie (Lime Sugar Glaze, Black Pepper Cream) & Chocolate Pot de Creme (Whipped Cream, Orange Streusel, Cocoa Nibs) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FqdKE49oeRx6tDVqa1Wtsw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: We all loved the blackberry hand pies more, since the crusts were deliciously flaky, and the lime sugar glaze/black pepper cream really tied everything together. The pot de creme was good, and very creamy, but the cocoa nibs were too crunchy and detracted from the dish. \n\nThe biggest misses were the two entrees, but overall we still had a fantastic meal here and hope to be back in the near future! The service was also excellent, and we felt like the servers really cared about our experience here. I hope to come back and try new dishes on their rotating menu soon! The seating arrangement is on the cozy side, so be prepared to be close to your dining neighbors. I wouldn't recommend dining here with a group larger than 6. There is also only one unisex bathroom, but it was very clean and spacious. The biggest drawback about dining here is the parking, which can be very difficult to find, especially on the weekends.

Pretty affordable wines and a constantly changing menu.\n\nMy 3 course meal for the night started with a summery corn soup. It was both savory and refreshing. I skipped the request for their fire grilled bread and instead opted for the $10 pasta supplement (choosing my carbs wisely)! A mushroom risotto was available but i can't resist comforting bolognese. Melting, burrata cheese topped it off. Too good - i'll have to try that at home! We were encouraged to share the pasta versus an order per person. The portion still seemed rather small but once you polish off your last 2 courses, you'll be perfectly content. My main entree was a branzino with cauliflower. Of all courses, this was the least impressive. I was much happier with their financier dessert. Vanilla ice cream topped the cake with lemon curd and blackberries. It was light and palate cleansing. I also shared a banana foster chocolate cake/brownie. Exact opposite of the first. Dense, super sweet and luxurious. Both really delicious!\n\nI'll be making another reservation soon ... they're gaining popularity fast.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Got seated right away and waitress served us water. \n\nFood/Drinks- friend and I shared our food so we could try most items. We ordered the same first course though\nTomato soup: had to order it again since I loved it so much last time. Burrata in there melted the same delicious way, but the soup was a tiny bit more tart than I remembered it, I still liked it a lot bc I like tart ;)\nThyme/garlic roast chicken: blown away by this dish. The chicken was so moist and soft and tender I asked my friend \"is this chicken?\" When I had the first bite that was just below the skin. The Brussels sprouts with it was tasty.\nBranzino: cooked nicely but a tiny dry, skin was crispy. Served with white beans and a fruit (?plum) jam that wasn't described on the menu so it was an interesting surprise \nChocolate pot de creme: delicious like last time. Bittersweet just the way I like. Rich, but not too sweet and the cocoa nibs with light cream complimented it so well\nHuckleberry coffee cake: berries were tart which balanced out the warm cake. Tasted coffee at the end of each bite and the vanilla ice cream was so smooth\nChardonnay and rose: enjoyed the Chardonnay more, but Rose was decent\nBread available upon request, but we didn't get any because we wanted to ensure we have enough room for the meal. We couldn't finish out desserts even though I really wanted to. Stuffed :'(\n\nService/Staff: still friendly and attentive, filled our waters periodically. The desserts brought over were the ones we ordered, but no mention of a happy birthday. They didn't remember that this dinner was a birthday celebration for my friend even though I called them to let them know beforehand and the staff said \"okay, I'll be sure to make note of it\". I guess they really just made a note of it and didn't act on it! By 7pm, waitress came by to ask if we were done with our desserts even though there was more than 50% left on each plate. That made me wonder if they were trying to wrap us up for another customer who was going to be in at 7:15pm or 7:30pm. A bit uncomfortable, but if that was the case, it was their job to do that. Anyway, we took another 5 minutes and then asked for the check. \n\nStill a terrific meal that is worth the price and the trek out to the Chinatown area. I'm disappointed that they had forgotten it was a special occasion since I called to inform them in advance and the staff sounded like she would do something about it... some simple birthday lettering on the dessert plate would have been a nice touch yanno?", "author": "Iris H."}

There are just way too many restaurants to keep up with. But when a chef suggested that we try it out for dinner, I figured I should trust his instincts. (If you're reading, don't get upset that I don't remember exactly what we ate). I would say that the overall experience was good although the servers kept trying to take our plates away when there was still a lot of food left. They were unsubtly telling us to hurry up. \n\nThere are two choices for each course on the menu and we decided to share and try every item (including the two pastas). For the appetizer course, the salad looked and tasted like seasonal fruits and veggies piled on a plate without too much tying everything together. The corn chowder soup option was much better (but the one I had at Lazy Bear was still far superior).\n\nFor our pasta courses, he really loved the squid ink conchiglie (and noted that this is a signature at Stones Throw). Perhaps my palette is not sophisticated enough to fully appreciate it as I thought it was good but not fantastic. I felt pretty similarly about the risotto option as well.\n\nThe main courses did not stand out to me at all so let's just move on. The only thing I could remember about dessert course is that the kitchen utilized the same crumble for both desserts. Overall, the meal was a great value (although even if it wasn't, I guess my wallet would not have known the difference).

Eating in San Francisco you're used to dropping a quick $100 for a good bite to eat, but money isn't the only thing that should be looked at. Trestle boasts a pre fixed menu that's not the glitz and glam of others but it's delicious, properly made along with impeccable service. I actually dropped my fork while in between courses. By the time I bent down to get it, the waitress was there with another. Now that's the kind of service that I've only seen at Michelin star restaurants. \n\nLet's get to the food. I started with the clam chowder while the hubby opted for the salad. My clam chowder had whole clams and mini potatoes. This was probably my least favorite dish. It was very thick and I wish it had a bit more going for it. Regardless, It was still not bad. The salad included a soft boiled egg which I thought was intriguing.\n\nWe opted for the pasta course which is a cool $10, and chose the pea risotto. Again, great for the price. \n\nThe main entree was the salmon. It was perfectly crusted with the bright pink in the middle. It came with a corn and pesto.. Mmmm delicious. \n\nI usually reserve my last star for the dessert, and Trestle earned the full 5 star. I had a warm chocolate brownie, drenched in carmel, walnuts served with a scoop of ice cream, how can you beat that!

Yum. \nRoasted pork loin. \nCrispy skin salmon. \nDevils food cake - little squares of delicious cake along with some dollops of peanut butter cream and a small oval of vanilla ice cream. \nThe menu changes regularly, so chances are you wont be able to order exactly what we had. \nEven at high end restaurants, it's difficult to have a dinner where every person loves every course they were served. \nTrestle pulled it off. \nCannot wait to come back.", "author": "Lewis C."}

Our glasses of water were kept full. They actually asked about dietary concerns (and although they could nothing about a cucumber allergy for the falafel salad, the thought counts). There were short gaps between courses but we never felt rushed. \n\nFood - You can choose a pasta instead of an entree or add it as a supplement for $10. For our two prix-fixe orders, we substituted one entree with a pasta dish (because we weren't feeling the salmon) and added a supplemental pasta. P.s. ask for the bread! Yum!\nAppetizer: I got the carrot-ginger soup with carrot cake croutons and carrot top pesto. I was afraid it would be two sweet because yes it was the sweet carrot cake you get at the corner bakery, but the soup was savory with a subtle umami flavor (sort of reminded me of the carrot version of chicken soup). \nPastas: The butternut squash risotto with rock shrimp,lemon, chervil was delicious. It was relatively fresh and light tasting for a rich risotto.The shrimp were perfectly cooked but cut into chunks mixed into the risotto (maybe not as impressive of a presentation but it was darn good). The second pasta was a garganelli bolognese with burrata, basil, calabrian chili oil. It was served on penne and topped with ooey gooey melted burrata which tastes a lot like mozzarella but has a much more neutral flavor and also creamier. Sadly, though this was my least favorite dish as I found it salty and pretty standard. \nMain: Sausage Stuffed Roast Quail. As you might guess, it's like a mini chicken that was mostly moist (especially near the center and professionally stuffed. It was served with creamy farro, red russian kale, and figs! I rarely touch figs (I think they look funny) but these paired perfectly with the quail. This was surprisingly yum when I thought it would be just okay. \nDessert: The white peony custard with quince puree, apples, and pomegranate was very refreshing and a clean way to end a meal. The custard reminded me of a panna cotta or an unfired creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (so just the creme, hold the br\u00fbl\u00e9e). The Huckleberry Coffee Cake with espresso streusel, vanilla ice cream, and mint was fun to eat.  The berries were a little too tart for me but when paired together with all the other components it was a great bite. Most surprising was the espresso streusel and mint flavors. It's a little odd at first but very addicting in a good way. \n\nOverall, it was ~$45pp before tip but after tax/SF-health fee: 2 meals + supplemental pasta. I would return again if friends were in town because the service was nice, some dishes were great, and its in a fairly convenient location. A reservation though can be tough.", "author": "Tammy T."}

That, and the ideal of an affordable prix fixe was a pretty appealing one. Given that they only have two choices per course, with the option of two additional pastas you can order, a party of two is perfect, and means you can pretty much order everything on the menu.\n\nI'll break it down by courses this time, rather than individual dishes, since the menu changes daily anyway:\n\n* Appetizers - Alright, so these were the most disappointing part of the meal. The salad and soup we had weren't bad, but they were just so... okay that they didn't stand out much at all.\n\n* Pastas - We actually only got the corn risotto, because we didn't think we could finish it all, but oh my lord was it FABULOUS. I totally wish it came in a (much) larger portion!\n\n* Entrees - Both the salmon and chicken were pretty solid. Not as mind-blowing as the risotto, but certainly the next best part of the meal, with the former cooked just right to still melt in your mouth, and the latter just right to still stay nice and juicy.\n\n* Desserts - This was a tossup: their hand pies had good flavor, and I think, if they were served hot and toasty, they'd be amazing. Unfortunately, served cold, they were a little too heavy, with undertones of old oil. The warm brownie a la mode though? Hrrrrrng. That, was to die for.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A mid size restaurant with perhaps some ten to fifteen tables. Not all of the seating was accessible from what I recall (the ones up against the walls), but a large majority of them are, so this shouldn't pose a problem. The area outside is North Beach though, so expect a (un)fair number of slopes.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

We shook it off and tried to enjoy ourselves, but our entire dinner experience took 2.5 hours even though we told our waiter (politely of course!) that we had another reservation at a bar down the street that we ended up being an hour late for.  I never really care about service, but it really felt like we were being neglected for other tables. Really unfortunate!\n\nAs for the food, the menu was inventive and the wine selections were delicious.  We got the chilled pea soup with creme fraiche (which the soup fans were very into), the smoked salmon BLT with burrata, which was pretty tasty as well.  The real winners here were the short rib main, very tender meat with a perfectly subtle glaze and the vegetarian truffle butter pasta.  The striped bass was pretty small and forgettable, and the mushroom pasta was pretty bland as well.\n\nOverall, if the service had been better I would consider returning, but it really made us feel forgotten and left a sour taste in our mouths.", "author": "Reyana F."}

The chocolate budino (pudding) was also a tad stingy. Overall, food was good, but forgettable. What wasn't forgettable however, was the poor service - which teetered on indifference and aloof.

Typically there are two appetizers, two main courses and two desserts to choose from for $35 per person plus an optional pasta dish (choose from two options) for $10 more. It's gotten a lot busier than when we first went so be sure to RSVP. Today I really enjoyed my choices which were the parsnip chowder, pan roasted salmon, uni tagliatelle and the chocolate velvet cake. The chowder's potatoes gave it a slight smokey flavor giving the soup a more balanced taste. The uni tagliatelle was cooked on the slightly more than al dente side, but still good, however I had a slight fishiness lingering in my mouth afterwards. The breadcrumbs add a little cruchy texture and you taste the uni flavor nicely. One of my extra favs of the night was the salmon. They cooked the salmon well with a crispy skin which I loved. The fish had a citrus touch with a crackle from the skin and a crunch from the fennel. Such a well balanced dish. Last, but not least, the chocolate cake! Grapefruit with chocolate cake with orange confit with jasmine meringue with ice cream and crunchy nuts of some sort!!! Such a joyful dessert that I wish for all to try! Oh and don't forget to eat some of their bread if you have tummy space. Your mouth will thank you for it. Thank you Trestle for an amazing meal, wonderful service and timeliness!

Unheard of and very much appreciated. In terms of ambiance, I'm actually a bigger fan of Stone's Throw. Trestle is smaller and feels a little more claustrophobic by comparison. We came on a Sunday night and ended up ordering the entire menu between all of us. Standouts for me included the duck confit and mushroom risotto, which I added the white truffle to... It was amazing. I also highly recommend adding the pasta courses (they're good for sharing). The menu rotates very frequently and I already see new items that I need to come back for. Be sure to check out the NON-insane markup on their wine. What I love most about Trestle is that they could be charging a lot more, but don't. They stay true to their mantra - enjoying a family gathering style, proper meal.\n\nJason - another amazing meal, thank you so much!

You're not going to be having a quiet conversation here, but you won't be rushing for the check just to escape the noise.  The servers are attentive and pleasant.  The food is really good -- nothing really that would make your eyes widen, but very good.  You'll probably want to order the extra course to ensure you get enough to eat; portions are adequate but by no means generous.  For two people eating the $35 prix fixe menu and sharing one $10 pasta course, two glasses of wine each, tax and tip, the bill was over $170.

I won't go into specifics -- I'm sure the offerings will change -- but each dish was well thought out and executed. The dishes were not pretentious, much like the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. The portion sizes were appropriate; I was completely satisfied at the end of the meal. \n\nThen there's the service. The service is really what earns this restaurant a special place in my heart. I've eaten at places with much higher price points, but I've never experienced such stellar service. Even though we did not order any wine, our water glasses were never empty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-19", "description": "I went to Trestle with two close friends the night before I got my wisdom teeth out. I was in the most pain I had ever been in my entire life after the extraction and subsisted on applesauce and Odwalla Mango Tango for an entire week, but the memory of my experience at Trestle kept me alive and guided me towards eventual recovery. \n\nFirst, can we just take a moment to appreciate the price? $35 prix fixe plus $10 for an optional pasta course is insane. I enjoyed every single course even with the limitations of the prix fixe menu. Perhaps it was just on the day I went, but I noticed that the prix fixe menu featured two options for each course -- one that was more comforting and one that was more adventurous. I had the chicory & persimmon salad, roasted local halibut, and yuzu posset, and shared two homemade pastas (mushroom pappardelle and sunchoke risotto) with my friends. \n\nI don't know what use it will be to go in depth on these dishes because Trestle's menu changes nightly even though there are recurring seasonal themes, but I have to share my enthusiasm so I'm going to go for it anyway. The chicken liver mousse in the chicory & persimmon salad was magical, especially paired with the candied nuts, which added a little bit of sweetness to contrast with the richness of the chicken liver and the fresh crunch of the persimmon and the strong flavor of the chicory. The sunchoke risotto is what I dreamed about every night when I was recovering from wisdom teeth surgery. The sharpness of the grana padano and the creamy, fluffy, loaded rice was so delicious. The mushroom pappardelle was incredibly flavorful and creamy and delicious -- I'm glad I shared it with friends because there is no way I could have ingested something so rich on my own. My favorite, however, had to be the yuzu posset, which turned out to be a delicious deconstructed variation of a kind of lemon bar/lemon curd reminiscent dessert. The presentation was beautiful and I appreciated the different and creative uses of citrus -- the candied citrus, the fresh citrus on top, and the citrus inside the custard. \n\nFinally, I loved the service -- the staff were so eager to help us when we had questions about ingredients and made sure we were enjoying our meal. As we paid our bill and left personal notes in the cute little notebook, I was already thinking about the next time I could come back.", "author": "Em S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-15", "description": "Those of you that live in San Francisco or follow the amazing San Francisco food scene, recently named Best Foodie City in the Country by Bon Appetite Magazine have probably heard of Trestle.  It's a restaurant that opened Spring of 2015 and offers a 3 course prixe fixe dinner for $35. Pretty unbeleivable, right? I thought the same thing which is what peaked my curiosity. See more about my experience, the gorgeous restaurant, the Trestle concept and of course the food below....\n\nWhat is the concept? The main idea is to offer well-executed food at a reasonable price,\" said Ryan Cole, one of the five partners in the Hi Neighbor restaurant group, which also includes chef Jason Halverson, Tai Ricci, Jason Kirmse and Cyrick Hia. The group wanted to open a restaurant that looked back to a different way of eating, hence the name Trestle, referencing the days of communal dining at a \"trestle table.\"\n\nHow does the menu reflect the concept? The restaurant's motto is \"the return to a proper meal,\" referencing a time when dining was less about the intricacy of the dishes, and more about the experience of sharing a good meal. The menu focuses on several simple, but precisely executed, courses. \n\nHow does it work?  Diners get two choices to choose from for each course. There's an additional pasta course you can add on for an extra $10 per person. \n\nWhat about the wine program? This is also heavy on value, with a big selection of bottles at $50 and under, and some splurge-worthy wines at $100+. Either way, the markup on wine is capped at $40, which means that diners can try a Grand Cru with dinner for a shockingly reasonable price. Wow, pretty amazing Trestle. Great concept and cost savings for us diners. \n\nWhy you should try this? Whether you're a foodie always wanting to experience the newest hotspot (does that ring a bell, I know it does for me) or just enjoy delicious food at reasonable prices, Trestle appeals to both groups. The atmosphere is very attractive with a simple, clean decor, yet not so sterile you can't relax and feel at home. The service is excellent with very friendly knowledgeable staff and the food is delicious at great prices! Pretty much the package deal!\n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista. Emily", "author": "JetSettingFashionista J."}

When Trestle first came out, I was a loyal fan. I praised this local joint and recommended it to everyone in sight. The last 6 months I have been to Trestle about 5 times and my expectations have lowered. The service is truly subpar. As a local, there are far too many places in San Francisco to be mediocre. Tonight was my fathers 66th birthday. I couldn't think of a better place than Trestle to help commemorate. Our server was just ok- the woman was not engaging and seemed uninterested in serving us ( this is actually the 3rd bad experience with this lady). Salad was 6/10 (bean pole) just OK. Squid ink risotto 6/10(flavorless) and trout was good. Since my dad decided to skip on the dessert and sub for the pasta, his birthday  candle came out with the main dish. It was tacky and very sad, to be candid, who doesn't offer a dessert for a birthday? Overall, my dad said why would you take me to such a crappy restaurant... which really hurt me. I have always loved Trestle, praised Trestle and recommend to family, friends and clients. I will give this place a break for a while. Too many places in SF for just subpar. If you see my previous review- I give 5 stars and make a slight comment on the service. Now 3 stars. Unfortunately places that lose the quality due in San Francisco.

My entree was branzino and the others had some kind of pork, which didn't look amazing to me but they all loved it. My branzino came with apple and celery salad - celery is the worst thing on the planet, but it wasn't overpowering and everything else was great. We tried both desserts.

I absolutely love that the menu changes every night, making your experience truly unique.\n\nI came to Trestle on a Tuesday for my boyfriend's birthday. With my friend's recommendation, I made reservations 6 weeks in advance. And I was sure happy I did; even 6 weeks in advance, there was some unavailability on certain days (Thursday-Saturday). \n\nSince you can choose from one of two dishes for each course (Appetizer, Pasta - optional, Main, Dessert), I ordered one of the dishes per course and my boyfriend ordered the other. This is definitely the best way to go if you want a taste everything. We chose to split one of the pastas and that was the right decision.\n\nCan't wait to return and see what's on the menu next time!", "author": "Emmy Q."}

I will give them the benefit of the doubt in assuming the format (prix-fixe only - you choose between two options for each course - at an affordable $35 base price) gives them the opportunity to be somewhat experimental so perhaps we just hit an off night. I'll do my best to give them another shot in the near future. \n\nThe food all sounds nice on paper and it was beautifully presented, but the flavors were odd. Every dish had ingredients that seemed out of place and perplexing seasoning. The pork schnitzel was especially funky. It tasted like McDonald's chicken nuggets. Don't get me wrong - I like nuggets. But it wasn't what I expected for pork schnitzel at a noteworthy spot. \n\nThe service was good. Very friendly and attentive.

We had a 4-course meal and it was really quite standard. Nothing was especially out of the ordinary. For a $200/meal I would have expected maybe a little more attention to detail with their plating, flavor pairings, etc. \n\nI can't say I was disappointed but I wasn't wowed.

I got to try all of the dishes since we had 4 people and tried to order different things.  Our server suggested two pasta dishes instead of 4 for the table, which worked out well. Tonight, we had: \n\nAppetizers: \n1. Roasted beet salad: red and golden beets with blue cheese and pistachios. It was a standard combination, done well. \n2. Roasted sunchoke soup: I love sunchokes in the fall.  The confit egg yolk made it nice and rich, and the sunchoke crumble added texture. It was a beautiful presentation, but it definitely needed salt. With some salt and pepper, it transformed the soup\n\nBread: \nTheir warm grilled bread with butter is worth the wait (upon request only).\n\nPasta Course: \n1. Butternut squash risotto: with rock shrimp and lemon. It needed a bit of salt, and the squash could have been cooked down a bit more, but the shrimp was really nice. The portion doesn't look big, but it's a pretty dense and rich dish, so one so enough for two people to share \n2. Anson mills polenta ravioli: I don't usually like ravioli, but the short rib sugo and smoked onion got me.  The pasta texture was good, but the toppings really made the dish \n\nMains: \n1. Pan seared salmon: the parsnip latke and baby turnips actually stood out more than the salmon for me.  The salmon was cooked well but was otherwise pretty standard\n2. Sausage stuffed roast chicken: anyone who knows me knows I love my chicken breast. Theirs came with a nice celery root puree and brussels sprouts, very appropriate for fall.  The chicken itself was all white meat but very flavorful and moist, with sausage stuffed under the skin. The skin was also browned nicely, and this was one of the best chickens I've had in a while \n\nDesserts: \n1. Pumpkin cheesecake: the maple cream didn't taste much like maple, and the cheese cake texture was off. I tasted pumpkin but not cream cheese. This dish was disappointing \n2. Chocolate devil's food cake: not dense enough for me, but the Asian pears and honeycomb were an interesting twist to it. I couldn't taste the honey  in the milk chocolate pudding, and this dish also benefited from a sprinkling of salt.\n\nI thought Stones Throw was just ok, but I really liked Trestle for their savory dishes (desserts were kind of a flop).  Too bad they are beer and wine only, but we had a nice $48 bottle of Tempranillo and some good beers. \n\nI would come back, but I wish we could substitute the dessert for more savory stuff!", "author": "Marilyn H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-11", "description": "This is a highly conflicted review. My friend and I were seated tonight (a Monday night) without reservations at about 8. Trestle is a gorgeous little restaurant with a strictly prix fixe menu. My date had eaten already, but wanted to meet me after work and keep me company while I ate. We ordered a bottle of wine, after we'd been offered a generous tasting. When the time came to order,  I asked for the full menu plus the additional pasta option, and I said that I would be the only one eating. The waiter told us that this was not allowed - that everyone at the table must order the full menu. I explained that my date had already eaten, and was there to keep me company and perhaps eat what I didn't, since a 3-course meal was a bit more than I usually eat for a weekday dinner. The waiter suggested that I eliminate the pasta course if it was too much food for me, but that we each had to order two full meals because, \"This is a small restaurant, and that's how it works here.\" I told our waiter that we would prefer to just settle our bill for the wine and leave. To the restaurant's great credit, they first offered to \"accommodate me\" (I.e., allow me to eat without forcing my friend to order), but at that point I was stressed out, had lost my appetite, and just wanted to go. The restaurant then VERY graciously comped us the wine we had ordered. So... I'm conflicted. I would have loved to love this place - the food looked and smelled amazing - and I totally appreciate how well they handled the situation in the end. But of course, I left hungry; and I felt like Trestle thought I was trying to get away with being a cheapskate when really, all I wanted was to have a nice meal in the company of my friend who wasn't hungry. My 3 stars are basically because I feel halfway like this was a 5 star experience and halfway like it was a 1 star experience. I also feel awkward and embarrassed enough that I doubt I would go back.", "author": "Lisa O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-17", "description": "Random Saturday dinner I decided to try Trestle. Overall, this is a good restaurant with a very limited menu. Yes, the menu changes daily, but as a diner (especially since most people now have allergies) it is difficult to plan ahead when you don't know the menu. I don't mind the menu changes daily and think more restaurants should do daily menu - I assume ingredients are fresh. I give the restaurant 3 stars because I consider the restaurant as average. Excluding the scallops, the food is decent but not amazing.  This is more of a neighborhood / in my pocket restaurant where I would go to relax. i would recommend Trestle, but would not be willing to wait for a reservation.\n\nTotal bill: $270.00\n2 tasting menu\n1 supplement (ravioli)\n1 bottle wine ($135.00) Chardonnay Far Niente 'Estate'\n1 desert wine\n1 port \n\nRestaurant:\nReservation was for 8:45 and the restaurant was 90% full.  By the time I paid (10:20) the restaurant was still full. The interior is loud, but annoyance will depend on your desire ignore people. The two woman sitting in the table adjacent to me were very loud, but I had tuned them out.\n\nFood:\nFalafel Salad:\n Why ordered: I enjoy eating salads, mint, and wanted something little. Moreover, I've traveled extensively in Asia Minor and the Middle East, so the salad description appealed to me. I would probably eat the salad again. \n** Pro: \n         - Cucumbers were really nice. Reminds me a little of Japanese/ S. Korean pickled cucumbers. \n\n** Con: \n         - The tzatziki and mint didn't have much flavour. I couldn't not really taste the mint. \n         Falafel was okay not nothing special. \n\nRavioli:I would not order again. Dish wasn't good compare to other items on the menu.\n** Pro: \n         - Pork favorable.\n         - Portion is big.\n\n** Con: \n         - I would have prefer to not have the peppers in the ravioli dish.  The peppers add texture to the dish but nothing else (opinion). \n         - Pork sugo (sugo is basically sauce, unless it is succo) was okay.  I think it was too thick for the dish. The sugo overwhelmed the flavors of the polenta.\n \n\nPan-Seared Scallops: Amazing!! These are perhaps some of the best seared scallops I've ever eaten. \n** Pro: \n        - speechless!! These are what pan seared scallops taste like - fresh, no rubber taste and not over cooked.\n\n** Con:\n       - Nothing.. \n\n\nFufu Persimmon Cake:\n** Pro: \n        - not heavy\n\n** Con:\n       - Nothing.. \n\nService:\nService was good and impressive for such a small restaurant and staff - 4 on waitstaff.  Overall, the staff was very friendly and attentive. I had a very nice waitress who was friendly but not intrusive. This is a restaurant where I would return because of the service.", "author": "Pierre C."}

It's also nice to be surprised by an ever changing menu. Service was great from the moment we walked in the front door to our last steps out of the restaurant.\n\nThe stand out dishes for us were the salmon/dill salad - super generous portion of salmon with not too much dill/mayo sauce and some delicious pickled red onions and cucumbers. The second stand out dish was the polenta ravioli with pork cheek sugo, melt in your mouth creamy and rich with some carrots and red peppers. Overall the ravioli ended up being our favorite dish, and it was an add-on.  Our complaints for the main courses were really that we wanted a little more salt and pepper, but that's our deal not necessarily a bad thing. Dessert didn't thrill either of us, the chocolate tart was just way too much, and the persimmon dish needed more persimmon.\n\nThe tables are really close together, which makes for some awkward butt on table sliding and you can really get to know your neighbors.  We met a lovely couple celebrating their 37th wedding anniversary in town from Seattle. Again, not a bad thing, but don't plan on having a really private conversation.\n\nOverall I liked Trestle, but I'm not going to be going out of my way to return.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-15", "description": "Review for 2/13/15\n\nFrom some of the reviews I read, it appears that it is hard to get a good reservation, but because my husband planned the dinner, I did not have this experience. Nor did he. He did call a month in advance though, and Trestle was able to squeeze us in for an 8:15. No qualms with that!\n\nUpon arriving, we were seated momentarily and shown the menu. Now, this being my first time and hearing great things about this place, I was very excited to try everything, and that we did. We ordered each item from each course and added the pasta supplement, which was a saffron risotto.\n\nAppetizer:\nCalamari and Smoked Fingerling Potato - The calamari was cooked perfectly, no signs of sogginess. The dressing that was paired with it complimented it perfectly. Take a bite of it with a bit of potato and it's got the right amount of crispiness. If you're going to do calamari, you better do it right. Thank you, Trestle. \n\nButternut Squash Soup - This was both our first time having butternut squash soup and it made quite the first impression. We are both now a fan, Every spoonful gave you the sense of warmth and comfort. It has some curry to it, which I'm not too big on, but after a few sips, I didn't even notice it. I could definitely go for this on a cold San Francisco night.\n\nSaffron Risotto - I love a good risotto. THIS was a good risotto. I will never refuse surf and turd and this dish had rock shrimp and chorizo with a tomato-like sauce over it. Forgive me as I don't remember all the ingredients. The creaminess of the risotto gave it a good texture and it was rich in flavor but not so rich or heavy in that it made you feel like you were taking a bite of butter. \n\nMains:\nCrispy-skin Striped Bass - Under average. I was disappointed because who doesn't love crispy-skinned fish. The fish lacked flavor and seasoning. The couscous was fine but I don't think it fit with the fish. No real big highlight.\n\nDuck Leg Confit - Wish we had both ordered this. The meat was soft, cooked perfectly, and had the nice crispy skin. When you add the forbidden black rice and peking jus into the mix, you got it just right. \n\nDessert:\nGrapefruit Panna Cotta - Hubby could only eat this one because the other one contained nuts. This was a plain jane dessert for us. The grapefruit really comes through 2-3 seconds into the bite and the granola was fine. I didn't bother eating too much of it because I was too focused on my own dessert.\n\nChocolate Tart - OH MY GOODNESS. This is one of THE BEST desserts I have ever had. From the beginning to end, every bite was consistently the same. After finding out that the whole thing was made with practically hazelnuts, I was a little sad the hubby couldn't try it, but after the first bite, i was very pleased I didn't have to share. Okay, so onto the tart .. The crust was made out of hazelnut and it was light and thin, breaks right with the spoon. The hazelnut dark chocolate filling with the hazelnut crumble was creamy with a bit of a crunch. Add a little bit of the earl grey ganache and creme/mandarin orange to that spoon of tart and you have heaven in your mouth. I will be dreaming of this, for I will never know if I will get it ever again.\n\nTrestle was such a great experience. The ambiance is lovely, not too noisy in there.

Instead of saying \"I apologize, let me clear the plates here and we will remake them for you\" she said \"so do you want me to take these plates away... Well if you're going to eat it I'm not going to give you another pasta\". It was a strange reaction and although she finally cleared all the plates, left a sour taste in our mouths. Our server however was more gracious came by and apologized for the salty pasta and took it off the bill.\n\nAfter the replacement pastas came, to our disappointment again it was very salty.  The mains came and the scallops were super salty, some of us couldn't eat it all. I was hungry so I cut the seared top off and ate the middle.\n\nFor dessert the pot de creme was ok but the bourbon whip cream was intense. The financier was dry dry dry. Tasted like a muffin from Safeway. \n\nNow I've been to Stones Throw and can say the food there is way better than Trestle, although nothing impressive. The desserts at Trestle are just as bad as Stones Throw... \n\nI don't get how SF can be so easily impressed by new restaurants. Trestle was sadly disappointing and I won't be recommending it to anyone.", "author": "Dien N."}

That being said, this is definitely the most bang  you can get for your buck in the city. $35 prix fixe for a meal, and service that could easily be $100 elsewhere is hard to pass up.\nThat aside, it was really such a great experience. Not pretentious whatsoever, and absolutely delicious. Getting a reservation was also pretty easy (did it the same week -- many places in the city you need to get one at least a month in advance).\nLuckily for me, my date was my best friend who is always down for sharing, so we got one of each of the items on the menu, and shared it. (I seriously recommend doing this).\nThe standouts were the cream of cauliflower soup (which I easily could have gobbled up 10 or so bowls of), the pumpkin risotto (essentially an umami bomb), the salmon (perfectly tender, with skin crisped to crunchy perfection), and the green tea custard. (The couple sitting next to us didn't finish their green tea custard, and it took me all my willpower to be a civilized human, and not as if I could have it). The sundae I didn't care for as much. It definitely felt cheaper, and more an afterthought by the chef than the green tea custard dessert. \nAll in all though, a great experience. Would highly recommend!", "author": "Rita K."}

I finally got to go and it was a great experience! Trestle has a prix fix menu which choices for each course. It's kind of hard to review a place like this because some of the choices change from day to know, so you won't know the menu you're going to have until that day. They have 3 courses plus an optional 4th pasta course. They are very flexible and allow you to twist the menu any which way you want. For example, you can substitute the appetizer with a (smaller portion) pasta dish and then get a main course and dessert OR you can substitute your dessert with a pasta dish (don't know why anyone would want to do that? but you can! haha). If you're vegetarian, they give you the veggie pasta option in a bigger portion size for your main entree. \n\nMy favorite parts of this meal was the appetizer and the dessert! For my first course, I got the sweet corn soup, it was so delicious (especially good if you love corn like that) and the crunchy corn pieces added a great texture to the soup. For dessert we got both the dessert options for the day: one was a chocolate brownie with pecans, caramel and vanilla ice cream while the other was brown butter financier with lemon creme, blackberries and vanilla ice cream. They both were great together because the brownie had a rich creamy taste while the other had a very light, citrusy taste. I enjoyed them both a lot! And if you come in a group of 2, get both desserts so you get to try a little of each! \n\nIn my opinion, the main course was just ok, I got a chicken dish which tasted very similar to chicken marsala, while my friend got one of the pasta dishes - ricotta gnudi with eggplant and cherry tomatoes. The chicken was cooked well and had a good flavor but wasn't amazing. The pasta dish was very rich and cheesy and the eggplant was fried, so this made the dish very heavy.  \n\nOverall, a pretty great place for a well priced prix fix menu. I think it is not as great for vegetarians, but for all others, I would recommend it!", "author": "Malika R."}

While sister restaurant Stone's Throw is a personal fave, I found a similar experience at Trestle, maybe even at half the price! Our waitress was the sweetest and made our dining experience very enjoyable- in fact all the people there were so kind. The food was all amazing- choosing each course from only 2 options definitely made the ordering a lot easier and more satisfying! The firebrand bread was also to DIE for- must ask for this (complimentary) if you are a carb lover (so worth the cheat day!) I had the butternut squash soup (excellent presentation), fried quail (really interesting combination with BBQ jus and Cole slaw for that southern feel), and huckleberry coffee cake with ice cream (MMM!!!) My friend got the other entree option (fried salmon with creamy farrow) which was just as delicious, perfectly cooked! I preferred something that I wouldn't normally be able to get or prepare myself though, and the quail did not disappoint ... So tender and full of flavor!

You get two choices each for an appetizer, meat course and dessert for $35 (not including tax or tip). A pasta course is $10 extra (I assume per person or per order but didn't ask). Bread is available upon request.\n\nSecond, the place is booked well in advance as word has spread about this amazing deal. But they reserve a few tables for walk-ins.\n\nWe arrived at 6pm on Thu to find the place full but they expected (75% probability) that something would be available around 6:30pm. I asked for recommendations for places to hang out nearby and they pointed me to a few nice bars saying I had enough time to get a drink and the table would be ready just as I was finishing. They even took my number and said they'd text me to let me know. I'm not sure why more restaurants don't do this but I LOVE it. I was already inclined to like this place based on such a basic service. So we went and had a drink and I actually received a text saying the table would be ready in 10 minutes. Perfect timing for us to pay the bill and walk back. I even got a follow-up text asking me if they should hold the table for us if we were going to be late (no chance of that!). I cannot say enough about this solicitous and gracious service. Not snobby, just super nice and thoughtful. More than expected at place with this kind of price point. They even took our bags and stored them for us while we ate.\n\nI was really prepped and in a good mood now. Hubby and I split the prix fixe menu by getting one of everything but skipped the pasta course. We also requested the bread.\n\nBoth appetizers were really good (salad, tomato soup). To give you an idea the roasted tomato soup came out in pitcher that they then poured into the bowl which had croutons, herbs and cheese in it. The salad was also artfully plated but more importantly yummy with a poached egg and lardons. 5 stars\n\nMains were nicely put together too but not as good as the appetizers. The salmon was tasty but the pork schnitzel was a little dry and not as tender and it should be. Our bread came out with the main dishes (very Euro) instead of as an appetizer. They had taken two slices of bread and fried / toasted them. Great with the butter or for sopping up juice from our plates. 4 stars\n\nDessert was the brown butter financier which I preferred over the chocolate pot de creme. The financier was broken up into pieces on the plate with a dollop of ice cream and other toppings sprinkled about. 5 stars\n\nTotal including tax, tip and beer = $100. A great experience at a steal.", "author": "Jean K."}

And it totally worked out, because all the regular dinnertime reservations were taken up for a few weeks out, so I booked one for 7:30 close to our anniversary.\n\nIt's right on the corner of Columbus and Jackson, and we scored parking directly across the street.  The restaurant was PACKED, and it's one of those places where the tables are close to each other and it's a bit hard to have an intimate conversation.  The interior is modern rustic and sleek, and strange but true, I thought the bathroom was super nice and clean (especially considering there's only one for all diners).\n\nThe menu for our evening was English pea chowder or falafel salad, crispy skin branzino or pork schnitzel, and peaches & cream or brownie sundae.  I opted for the pea chowder, branzino and brownie sundae, while Husband got the falafel, pork, and brownie.\n\nHoly crap, the pea chowder was SO GOOD - it's a pea puree (lactards beware, this will set your stomach OFF) poured over cooked smoked salmon, breadcrumbs, mint, and potatoes.  Perfect amount of texture from the breadcrumbs, fragrance from the mint, saltiness from the salmon.\n\nI also really enjoyed the branzino (fish), but I didn't care too much for the squid ink pasta that was under it (I can't remember what type exactly, but they looked like pasta pearls) because it had little taste, and the squid rings didn't add much flavor or texture either.\n\nWe also received two pieces of grilled bread (!!) along with our main dish (though we had to ask our waitress twice for it, and we were expecting it as a filler between the appetizer and main).  Since it's apparently grilled to order, it came out piping hot and crunchy, and the butter melted right on top.  Uh can I have like a whole order of this?  Thanks!\n\nFinally came dessert, and though I don't like brownies on their own, I must admit that ice cream, caramel and candied walnuts make them really tasty.  Great combination of warm, sweet, and crunchy.\n\nVery impressed with the quality (and quantity) of food for just $35.  We considered splitting a pasta dish ($10 - and it comes between the appetizer and main) but we're glad we didn't, because both of us were stuffed by the time we were done, and the pasta would've been too much.\n\nThe only downside is that because of their changing menu, they can't always accommodate food allergies, plus they only have two options to choose from for each course.\n\nOne of my new faves for a lovely dinner that won't break the bank!", "author": "Tori S."}

To dig into the details:\n\nCarrot / Ginger Soup - very basic carrot soup with a heaping amount of fall spice. The spice overpowered the soup. \nFalafel Salad - beautiful presentation, better than the soup, but a truly inferior version of a falafel.\nMushroom Risotto - I actually loved this, very well executed and the best dish of the night. Would order again in a heart beat. \nShort rib with Farro - Very simple and basic flavors, everything was cooked well, nothing stood out.\nScallop with Lentils - scallops were cooked beautifully, but had to unfortunately be accompanied by a lame effort at Indian lentils, which didn't work together with the dish at all.\nDevil's Food Cake - Imagine a dry day old chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting.

This was only our second meal at Trestle and dare I say it was better than the last. \nTheir soup game is on point, we had the Clam Chowder the first time we visited and claimed it was the best in San Francisco.

The Little Gem Salad with a Soft Poached Egg and Crispy Bacon Lardons should be the only way to eat a salad. \nBoth meals we chose the Pasta Supplement that is so worth it and for $10 extra, I'll take that all day long.

Beautiful to behold and a perfect way to start a meal.\n\nGarganelli bolognese with burrata, basil and cracked pepper was a great.  The meat sauce was replete with meat and who isn't going to love having burrata melted over their pasta?  This plate shows that Trestle serves what real people actually like to eat.\n\nFinally scallops with chickpea hummus, calamari, peas and avocado.  Every component of the plate was perfectly prepared including the calamari, which can sometimes get rubbery.  \n\nService was great, the price was right, and I was a happy camper.", "author": "David D."}

I'll get relevant in a bit but the question on my mind now is:\n\nJust how many reviewers are going to write \"pre\" fixe, and will Yelp automatically weight their reviews at like .00000000001?\n\nAlso, I noticed an \"elite\" reviewer--they tend to be stingy with their stars because they're very sophisticated--describe some disappointment in a mashed potato dish... I had the same dish; it was a great dish; it was a risotto... Food for thought. (pun)\n\nSnark aside, it may be hard to rely on reviews for this restaurant, qua food, because their menu will constantly be changing. On the other hand, it's pretty easy to rely on the fact that the chef came from Michael Mina and hit it out of the park with Stones Throw. So...the food's likely to always be great. On to things that won't change nightly or semi-nightly:\n\nIt's a beautiful space and a great addition to the neighborhood. I didn't expect it to be that busy, but it was packed the two night's I've been since opening. To that end, it's a smaller space so I'd definitely get reservations. There's no place to wait inside but, with the owner bringing good things (beverages of choice) to those who wait, the balmy San Francisco evening becomes perfectly enjoyable--THANKS climate change!\n\nI'm very eager to gain 20 lbs exploring their ever-changing menu over the coming months. But with the value passed on to diners from the prix fixe concept, I'll at least be able to afford a gym membership for me to stare at while digesting on the couch with great self-loathing yet satisfaction...", "author": "Matthew K."}

I sorta don't want to give it 5 stars so it doesn't get too busy that I can't get in, but that wouldn't be right.\n\nMany Pros:  Wonderful combinations of flavors in most dishes - also the dishes are artfully pretty.  Several dishes had a little \"heat\" normally missing from California/continental cuisine.  I like the modern but warm wood-heavy decor.  Nice people.   Diverse (bottled) beer menu.  Overall, a very good value. \n\nTips:  Despite the 3 courses, you are not overly full leaving, so go ahead and split that extra $10 pasta course - it's not too much.  Also they will let you get another savory course instead of dessert with an upcharge.\n\nPossible Improvements:  Offering cheese course as dessert option.  We liked the music a lot (70's rock when we were there), but maybe everyone wouldn't?  If your table was not ready when you arrived, not sure where you'd wait - very small entry space.  But no one had to wait when we were there, so maybe they are managing it well.\n\nFinally:  I believe dishes change daily, but here are some comments on what we had in case you find them on your menu:\n\nAsparagus+Poached Egg salad - I think the egg may have been sous-vide rather than poached - I prefer a little firmer egg, but still enjoyed it.\n\nCalamari Salad - My teen son got this as appetizer and it was so good my husband changed his \"dessert\" course to have this instead. Calamari came 2 ways and it had a little spicy aioli and potatoes.  mmmmm - total winner.\n\nPasta with Bolognese, Burrata & Chili Oil - Great.\n\nShort Ribs - My son and husband both got this.  It seems like others didn't like it as much as they did.  Husband thought it was perfect; my son liked it, but found it a little rich with the creamed spinach - he would have liked plain steamed spinach with it.\n\nCrispy Branzino with Ravoli - Excellent. I was actually surprised I liked it so much (I almost got the short ribs but wanted to be different than the boys).\n\nBlackberry Hand Pies - A little dry, but good berry flavor and the accompanying whipped cream was nicely delicate.\n\n\"Cherries Jubilee\" Brownie - My son loved it but I thought it was too sweet (I don't generally like chocolate cakes anyway so it's probably just a taste preference).", "author": "Anne M."}

We came here because I was trying to find something Italian and this looked interesting with the idea of picking different courses and being price fixed it would make it easy splitting the meal with everyone.  I guess when I walked in I was a little surprised by this place.  I mean it is extremely small.  The parking is also very difficult so note that if you plan to come at busy times.  The menu was also not exactly what I was expecting.  The people who were at the table were very diverse in terms of what they eat so at the beginning of the meal I realized it was going to be a real challenge to accommodate everyone.  I can be flexible in these cases but my cousin doesn't eat any wheat or dairy and the menu here pretty much has all of those things in their menu.  The other issue is they only give you two choices to choose from on each course so again it can be challenging for picky eaters.  The good news is the waitress was very thoughtful and after she heard all of the restrictions she talked with the chef and they were able to modify all the dishes so that it worked out.  They had a nice beer and wine selection and overall the atmosphere is fun but slightly cramped and noisy as they are totally full every night.  What I liked about this place was that you could relax and hang out and enjoy each course and take your time with no pressure.  It also felt like you were not just going out to eat but you were enjoying the SF atmosphere.  None of us live in SF so it's a fun change to go to a place like this.  Overall besides the restricted menu we all had a good time.", "author": "Ron K."}

I walked by the restaurant twice thinking the main entrance was a back door, FYI there is no hostess booth up front so it looks a little weird. Seating was crowded with our table about 2 inches from the table beside us... eavesdropping came with the territory.\n\nThe food was amazing. We started off with the tomato burrata and foccacia soup. I (not so) jokingly admitted it tasted like Chef Boyardee ravioli. Not a great date appetizer, as my friend and I were face-in to the soup pulling out strands of melted burrata from our mouths/chin for 30 seconds at a time. We shared a corn risotto, which was delicious, and the main entrees for the evening, fish and stuffed chicken were impeccably cooked. The chicken was one of the most tender I'd ever tasted and the fish was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Dessert was delicious (chocolate pot de creme and the berry lemon curd financier) and I could only eat a few bites from bursting at the seams.

Located in North Beach, this tiny spot is a gem. For a set price of $35, with option to add on a $10 pasta course, you get an appetizer, main & dessert. As others have noted, the service is excellent (especially for the price point) and I appreciated the ambiance/space/exposed brick. I think Trestle is a unique experience, obviously contingent on the menu du jour, but I don't see how you could top the value for the price in SF!\n\nThe details:\n\nMy friend and I decided to go here on a whim after hearing rave reviews. So, on a random Tuesday, we made our way over to this little spot in North Beach. We planned to walk in, but the restaurant is tiny (approx 20 tables) without a bar and they were booked solid until 10pm. The host was incredibly friendly and took our name down, encouraging us to stick out a bit of a wait. We went to grab a drink at Comstock Saloon and play the waiting game -- well that paid off, not even 10 minutes in I received a call from Brian asking us to head back over.\n\nWe decided to split a bottle of wine, on the recommendation of our waiter (and the selection was spot on), and tasted all the courses, including one pasta dish. We had the following dishes: \n\nApps: Falafel Salad: Crispy Lavash, Tzatziki, Mint & Sweet Corn Soup: Corn Fritter, Arugula Puree, Roasted Corn \nPasta:  Garganelli Bolognese: Burrata, Basil, Cracked Black Pepper\nMain: Pan-Roasted Salmon: Israeli Couscous, Summer Squash, Sauce Vierge & Sausage-Stuffed Roast Quail: Grilled Peaches, Red Russian Kale, Farro Verge\nDesserts: Brown Butter Financier: Lemon Curd, Blackberry Compote, Vanilla Ice Cream\nChocolate Pot de Creme: Bourbon Whipped Cream, Orange-Almond Streussel, Cocoa Nibs \n\nWe both liked every single dish that came our way but agreed that the sweet corn soup (perfect for a warm summer night), pan-roasted salmon, stuffed roast quail and the brown butter financier were the highlights.", "author": "Maya C."}

I would definitely make reservations at LEAST a month ahead of time. They get booked quick on Fridays and saturdays. The service, the food, and the ambiance was just perfect. Its a small restaurant so seating is limited. But very cozy. Menu is straight forward. You have 2 choices between the appetizers, main course, and dessert. And the menu does change as well. All for 35 dollars. You can add a pasta element for an additional 10 dollars and there's two choices for that as well. I would definitely add only one pasta supplement if theres only 2 of you. Getting both was just a tad bit too much for 2 people. But my boyfriend and I just ordered one of each just so we can try a little bit of everything. And let me tell you it was delicious! They also gave my boyfriend a birthday card right when we got seated which was very thoughtful!! This is what we ate:\n\nAppetizer course:\nLittle gem salad w/ duck liver mousse: 4/5. (Duck liver is definitely an acquired taste. Boyfriend didn't like this at all, but I enjoyed it)\nButternut squash soup: 5/5 (creamy and so flavorful, must get!)\n\nPasta supplement:\nMushroom risotto: 5/5 (and I'm not a risotto fan and I LOVED  this, very creamy but not too rich.

If on the other hand you usually don't get dessert and don't do multi-course this place is a miss and if you want more interesting ingredients than chicken and chop salad and brownies this may also be a miss.\n\nWent tonight. The two mains were the sea bass and a roast chicken. The starters were a pea soup with smoked salmon and the little gem salad. They put the bacon on the side for us and used a meat-free vinaigrette. They also can make a completely vegetarian version of the three course meal.\n\n    The pea soup was the best thing by far. A good serving with fresh peas and salmon that had the soup pours on it table side. The sea bass was good with a nice crisp skin. I found the chicken to be rather bland in flavour on it's own but the sauce with it was delicious and full of umami.\n\n    The \"pavlova\" was not a pavlova at all. It was a tiny chewy meringue rather than a slice of the pavlova which is more marshmellowy in the middle usually and shaped like a cake. The portion of fruit to the meringue was off with way more fruit than meringue and there was no whipped cream. The taste was fine especially eaten together but the whole dish was undeveloped.\n\n    The other dessert was a brownie with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce. It was tasty but nothing special. Since every meal will come with dessert I wish they had put more thought into the desserts.\n\n    They said they are going to be changing some of the menu every two days and they have about 40 dishes already planned.\n\n    It was full the entire time we were there and it was running very smoothly. There was no wait for course nor were they rushed out, the servers and all FoH were all friendly and informed.\n\n    The space is noisy but they have put sound baffling panels on the ceiling and the brick walls and beams are charming.\n\n    Parking on the street was easier than I thought it would be and we parked a of couple blocks away where all the galleries are towards the Embarcadero.

Simple menu, for $35 I it's a good price for a nice setting. I absolutely love the squash soup (I love squash) and pairing it with almond crumble was such a good match. The falafel salad was mediocre. The pasta bolognese was actually average and slightly on the salty side. I ate like 2-3 bites. And for entree, not too bad.

This place simply rocks. $35 for a 3-course menu (add a pasta course for $10 -- do it (get one to share for two) it is awesome). \n\nThe staff is fine-dining attentive and the food is prepared with attention to detail that belies its reasonable price. This place will be mobbed for the foreseeable future with foodies looking to escape the usual SF screw job and get a taste of comfort cooking for discerning palates.\n\nIt's a prix-fixe 3-course menu, with two choices for each course. The theme seems to be one safer choice per course and one more adventurous one. Whichever you pick, you are treated to deliciousness. Both show off some serious skills in the kitchen. Even a simple little gems salad gets dressed up with thick morsels of bacon and a perfectly fried egg. These guys are serious about treating their guests to a real treat in every course.\n\nThe wine list is mercifully bullshit-free and is reasonably priced for a casual meal-most clock in around $40. Plus, they have an indulgent section if you want to throw down a couple of hundred on a bottle. Perfect. Request the bread, too. It's grilled, soft, flavorful and kicks all kinds of ass.\n\nOnly niggling details--there needs to be a screen or something to hide the dishwashing station from the few tables on the right side of the room. The space is tight, so I get it, but still... We were seated in close quarters with our fellow diners, but the staff's pleasant, attentive service kept the scene intimate and enjoyable. So, even the dishwashers weren't that big of a deal. The room is beautiful otherwise.\n\nIt was Sunday night, so a set of Jazz at Doc's across the street was in order. The perfect combo.

There was wayyyy too much salt and cream in the majority of the dishes rendering them barely edible for me.\n\nIf you have high blood pressure this is definitely not the place for you.  After eating here I felt like I was going to get it!  \n\nWe had the corn soup, very creamy but good and the tomato salad which was the only dish that was not salty and overly seasoned.\n\nWe ordered their scallop and it came with carmelized onion, lentils and some kind of curry sauce that was inedible due to the scallop being salty as heck as well.\n\nWe also ordered their pasta for $10 more.  It was the saltiest dish.  The ravioli had beef and horse radish.  The horse radish was way too over the top in some bites.  The meat was good though and the ravioli.  It was just too bad the dish was so salty.\n\nThe risotti pasta was even worse.  Salty and creamy with too much butter it appears.  Very inedible in general.\n\nThe deserts were overly sweet.\n\nI guess it depends on what type of pallet you have.  We don't like salty and over seasoned dishes.  We want the dish to speak for themselves.  \n\nOverall, we would not come back because we couldn't eat the salty and creamy dishes.  If they added less seasoning this would be a home run.  \n\nThe staff were very attentive and continually gave us more water and cleared our tables and gave us new utensils quite frequently.  They run a fast/tight shift.  \n\nAlso, this is very close to north beach/Chinatown there is only garage parking pretty much so add that to you bill as well.", "author": "Eating And Living Well U."}

But as more people arrived (we were the first ones there at 5:30) the music volume was lowered.  Unfortunately, the restaurant become warmer and warmer and was quite stuffy by the time we left.\n\nMy other negative that irked me was my glass of champagne was half full upon arrival.  At least six other people ordered champagne and their glasses were filled to an inch from the top.  It still kinda pisses me off.\n\nI saw a few other tables get bread but we didn't see it offered on the menu and our server never mentioned it.  Not sure why some people get bread?  I don't  understand the concept of a restaurant forcing you to inquire about it.\n\nThe corn soup, and  the gem salad were unbelievably delicious.  We ordered the two pastas and they both were fantastic.\n\nWe would have been happy right here and could have left happy.  I wish somehow they could figure out a way to come in and have a salad and pasta.\n\nNext was the entrees of short rib ((good)) and salmon ((boring)). Entrees need some work.  Again, I'd be happy to not have an entree next time, if we came back.  But overall this place is pretty darn good for $35, but not quite swoon worthy for $170 which was our final bill (tax, tip, pasta extra $$, and three glasses of wine).\n\nThe banana foster brownie sundae was out of this world good and Mr. Foodlover  doesn't even like bananas!

They were running a bit late, but offered some free bubbly as an apology and were super nice and attentive.  I went with the GF, so sampled everything they had to offer.\n\nWine - $11 Barbera was solid.  $14 tempranillo was excellent.  Probably a reflection of my taste in wine, rather than an indication that the Spanish did it better than the Italian.\n\nFirst course - english pea chowder was delicious.  Rich, creamy, green, with just the right consistency in the chowder - not to thick, but still hearty and creamy.  Little gem salad was good, but basically a delivery medium for chunks of bacon and an egg.  So it was a bacon and egg salad.  It was very good, but I won't give them that much credit because the bacon did all the work that was necessary.\n\nPasta course - let's be honest, unless you are celiac, or otherwise mistakenly believe that gluten is somehow bad for you, the pasta course is not optional.  The raviolis tasted like Spring, with light, crunchy corn, citrus notes, and buttery pasta.  The bolognese was fantastic, with a generous portion of burrata gently lain on top, balancing out the acidic flavor of the pasta sauce.  Just the perfect mix of hearty, meaty, spicy goodness.  You could eat the sauce like a stew, but the garganelli were the perfect delivery method.\n\nMain course - hard to stay hungry with the first two delicious courses, but the mains held their own.  Salmon was cooked perfectly, with a touch of crispiness outside, but moist and a the right kind of flaky inside.  Flavor was perfect, not overly salted.  The accompanying farro was killer.  Shortrib pot roast was less perfect, but still very good.  Potatoes au gratin did not blow me away, but you can't go wrong with potatoes and cheese.\n\nDessert - strawberry rhubarb pavloca was great, with citrus and sour notes in the fruit to balance the chewy, dried marshmallow texture of the pavlova.  Brownie sundae with elderflower ice cream was what you would expect.  The elderflower ice cream won for most intriguing taste of the night.\n\nSuper friendly, attentive staff, very good food, great affordable wine list.  They missed perfection on the pot roast, and I felt like the little gem salad was cheating, though delicious.  The price point is great.

The menu is posted late the night before for the following day. There are two choices for each course for $35 for the 3 courses with an optional pasta addition for $10. One partner selected option A of the appetizer, entree and dessert and with the other half of the couple selected the other. We also tried an order of each pasta option which we shared amongst the four of us. The firebrand bread was nice and warm but took a long time to come -- finally arriving at the same time as our appetizers. We split a bottle of wine for the table and thought the wine list was extremely reasonable and well rounded. The room was quaint and rustic with trestles (hence the restaurant name) and high ceilings. We didn't enjoy our table near the front of the house because of the draft that accompanied the door opening and closing. \n\nWe thought the corn soup and quail croquette was extremely tasty. The asparagus salad with bacon was crisp and fresh yet savory. The crispy Branzino was perfectly fried and served in a tasty bed of squid fregola and a gremolata pur\u00e9e. The herb roasted chicken was a sizeable portion of moist chicken and accompanied by carrots and other root vegetables. The brownie and caramel sauce with ice cream was nothing amazing but one dessert you can't go wrong with. The blackberry hand pies were a little dry but had nice warm filling that oozed as you took a bite, a tart or creamy gelato would have made the dish better. We thought the meal was solid especially given the reasonable price! Definitely a restaurant we'll visit again when the menu has evolved!", "author": "NJ A."}

But going to a prix fixe place takes some preparation, tummy-space wise.  So for my birthday, I decided to semi starve myself in order to fully enjoy a 3-course meal, my partner was game, so off we went.\n\nWe ate there 2 days ago.  We both had the smoked salmon salad, we shared the polenta ravioli, my partner had the branzino and I had the flank steak for the main course and, for dessert, I had the chocolate tart and my partner the lemon financier.  We also each had a slice of their complimentary slice of bread (upon request).  Of everything we had, the 2 things I enjoyed the most was my dessert and the slice of bread.  The smoked salmon was way too salty to have spread all throughout a dish so we both ended up leaving most of the fish behind, eating everything else on it.  The raviolis' dough were too thick and tough in sections where they are not fully soaking in the sauce.  My steak was also somewhat salty and tasted one note.  My partner thought her main's fish was delicious but the accompanying pickled juice was unnecessary and lessened the dish for her.  The financier did not include a hint of lemon despite its name.  \n\nSo, all in all, it satisfied my curiosity but I don't feel the need to return anytime soon.", "author": "Yvette F."}

The promise was so huge, but fell way short. My friend and I ordered opposite meals, covering the full menu. The appetizers were thoughtful but somewhat poorly executed in both flavor and presentation. My burrata was goopy and the salad was blandly seasoned. Secondi was the worst part of the meal. I adore all risotto, perfectly executed or not. This was Rice-a-roni quality and not risotto. It was overly salted, bizarrely creamy (which I later learned was not from the starch of the rice but actual cream) and the butternut squash highlight undercooked and randomly inserted into the rice. The dessert was very good and we both agreed the only positive of the meal. I was also disappointed by the wine list.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-06", "description": "We were excited to try Trestle based both on the positive reviews as well as the novelty of trying something new.\n\nFor context, we are skeptics on new restaurant concepts in San Francisco only because they tend to be overpriced, overhyped and a general disappointment. I find that in an effort to outdo the last restaurant opening, SF restauranteurs are compelled to create small plate menus at ridiculous prices yet neglect the basics.\n\nTrestle is a quaint new restaurant venue in the Jackson Square/FiDi/North Beach neighborhood that is both charming and unique. The space itself is small and makes for a great date setting on even a casual Sunday night dinner. The staff is incredibly inviting and make you feel welcome as soon as you arrive, something some restaurants miss.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, Trestle offers a $35 prix fixe menu with a rotating menu. There is definitely value in the pricing, and it gives a couple or table of 4 an opportunity to try and taste different things. The downside however is that the menu may include course which do not suit your palette that evening. That said, we found ample variety on the menu for most tastes.\n\nAmong our favorites were the cauliflower soup, freshly poured table-side with a meat garnish, a mushroom starter salad as well as the butternut squash risotto (available for a $10 supplement to share). What was most surprising about our experience was that the mains were not the highlight of our meal. We ordered the Arctic Char and Beef Short-ribs, the latter of which was slightly better. The Char was basic and quite fishy and the beef just wasn't that memorable unfortunately compared to the starters. All in all it was the experience itself that wowed us. I think the mains will vary based on the night so perhaps this was a fluke.\n\nLastly we ended with desert which was a grapefruit type pot de creme and a fruit cake of some sort. Unfortunately neither were amazing, but again this could have just been the night. I would have preferred something more basic and wholesome like a take on an apple cobbler.\n\nWe were definitely head back to Trestle, and I would highly recommend giving it a try!", "author": "Bryant W."}

These people are no nonsense. I arrived at 5:15PM for a 5:30 reservation and the doors were locked. I peered through the glass doors and it was clear there was a staff meeting going on - good for them for preparation.  But it was cold and I was bored so I wandered up the street to Comstock for a drink. My friend arrived and the bartender made her a fabulous drink, so we enjoyed that. Unfortunately 20 mins had passed and we were late getting back to Trestle. Lots of attitude thrown our way about being late, even though I told them I tried to check in early to locked doors. It was as if my mouth was opening and no words were coming out, completely ignored. They did seat us. We enjoyed delicious food ( be sure to ask for the bread when you order to avoid bread-ordering attitude).  Cauliflower soup was divine. Salmon was delicious. Desserts completely suck, I would have been happier with a platter of Oreos. My friend and I were shooed out so the table could be turned (I get it, but it still sucks).\n\nSo I will say this.  Go try this restaurant and enjoy your food. It's good and it's cheap. But don't book here if you want to forget where you are and engage in a meaningful conversation.  I might go back with my husband to try it again but this time I will have the right mindset. Get there on time, eat your food and get out.  That is a thing, I can do that.

Everything was delicious.  Good wine list and great service.  I am giving 5 stars because it was really wonderful, but I have two suggestions for improvement:  (1) The music is WAY too loud.  We had to yell at each other to be heard.  Having music is good.  Having music that is too loud is bad.  (2) Three of the four of us had the heirloom tomato salad.  Curiously, it was very evident that the tomatoes had been refrigerated.  It's never a good idea to refrigerate tomatoes and serve them cold.....  Having said that, this place is terrific and we intend to return often.", "author": "Thomas M."}

I'm very into dishes having 'personality', which means both having flavor and flair. Trestle's food definitely had personality. The portion sizes were also very generous. By the time I got to dessert, I was so full that I was only able to savor one bite of the cheesecake and scoop up all the cranberry seeds before admitting defeat. I would definitely recommend adding a pasta supplement as well. We ordered the shortrib ravioli.

We also split the two pasta supplements of the day: mushroom risotto and ravioli.\n\nAmbience was modern with a touch of rustic. Service was attentive and friendly. A great place for a dinner with friends (easy-ish to split the bill), or a romantic date. One comment though is that the tables are a little crowded (the space is quite small).

Amazing. It had a spicy kick to it, and the shells still on the clams, which made it fun to eat. We were licking our bowls. 2) Added the bolognese pasta. Divine. House-made pasta was perfect, and the sauce delicious. 3) Short ribs. So tender and flavorful, and the breadcrumbs, onions, and special sauce were perfect compliments. Again, licking our plates. 4) Peaches 'n cream cobbler dessert for me, the brownie bananas foster for my date. Both unique and very tasty.

And it was really good but my reasoning for the 3 stars is only because i've definitely had a better prix fixe meal/options before. The starters were great and i really loved the heirloom tomato salad better than the corn soup. The pasta supplement was on point but i wasn't really going here thinking that i would like the pasta dish the best. Both main courses were \"meh\" the fish wasn't flavorful at all and the \"forbidden black rice\" tasted like plain brown rice. Still good but just not my favorite. The sausage stuffed quail was pretty smokey and i did like the added touch of peaches to that dish. Both desserts were fine. This is a place that changes its menu weekly so we may have just gone on an off week. It didn't help either that we had a woman who was obnoxiously loud sitting next to us. I couldn't hear myself or my boyfriend talk. The seating arrangement put our two top pretty much at the same table as them without really being at the same table. I think the hostess could have sat us at a different table and been a bit more conscious of that. There were at least 4 other table options that she could have sat us at.

It is a really good concept to have a limited menu with a low price.  It seemed like they were saying \"a three-course dinner is only $35\" and then forgot to deliver the goods.  \n\nAlmost everything we ate was mediocre.  The roasted tomato soup was bland.  The corn risotto was under seasoned. The grilled bread with butter was delicious but a very brief flash of \"yum!\" in an otherwise unremarkable meal.\n\nPork schnitzel was very skinny and was mostly panko and really had no flavor; even the fennel and melted cabbage accompaniments were under cooked and flavorless.  The best thing we had was the ravioli in hollandaise with crispy prosciutto.  If everything had been close to that Trestle could have redeemed itself.\n\nProbably the most disappointing dish was the brown butter financier (a/k/a pound cake).  It was just a sweet mess on the plate.\n\nService was very good.  The place was way too noisy but overlooking that, the sum total of the experience was \"meh\".  \n\nI don't know how other reviewers rated Trestle so highly.  With only six or eight dishes to prepare you would expect each one to be absolutely amazing.

Tables are close together so you can hear your neighbors yelling at one another over the noise.

We were running 15 minutes late due to an uber driver who drove like my mother and decided to fight his way through Chinatown, but I called ahead and the host was very understanding and accommodating. The space is quite small and they have crammed as many tables in as possible. I don't know if it was the acoustics or just our luck, but we had some of the loudest table-neighbors. The price is absolutely right, and I like not having to make too many decisions (ideally I could eat a whole menu), so the prix fixe menu was perfect. The broccoli soup had amazing flavors, but an oddly tough arancini in the middle. The mushroom pasta is unbelievably delicious, creamy and well balanced. My date's bass portion was quite small compared to my big honkin' duck leg, which was well seasoned, but a tiny bit dry. The chocolate tart had a crumble that was similar in texture to the arancini - much too hard and well, not crumbly. Overall it was a solid meal for a very reasonable price.", "author": "Claire T."}

I think I'm still flabbergasted by the sheer fact that this exists. Service was impeccable. Our server was down to earth, gracious. She made our dining experience. I started with the roasted sunchoke soup. I love sunchokes and cooking with them but never thought about putting it into a soup form. The pickled flavor profile cuts into the creaminess of the soup, which I appreciated but wasn't my most favorite. Personal preferences though, I'm not crazy about cream-based soups. The confit egg yolk made it aesthetically gorgeous. Second course: I had the sausage stuffed quail, which was delicious. They even left the bones so that we could eat with our fingers to mimic a real quail. The highlight though was the   pasta with burrata. Best pasta dish I've had in a while. Dessert was good, but I was still hung over that pasta to remember what exactly it was. Definitely would recommend this gem.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Unfortunately, my meal had a great appetizer (butternut squash soup) but only a mediocre at best main and disappointing dessert. My pasta was good but not great, as in it is definitely better than what I can make at home, but it isn't going to make me crave it next time (pasta course is extra). Service was faultless except nobody thanked us when we walked out which always leaves a bad feeling (hints to me that they are too busy to notice you). Still, a place with great potential. I am still intrigued enough to browse at what's cooking every once in a while. They should print their unalcoholic drinks on the menu (why not)?", "author": "George L."}

I  don't normally write reviews here but wanted to say something about how refreshing and needed it is to have a restaurant taking the more European route of offering casual upscale three course prefixe dinners that more of us can afford.  I dropped over $75 on each of the prelisted restaurants splitting with people and still the food and intimate charm was valued at Trestle.  Trestle is well designed, good service, and with a lovely plating of two different menu options for anyone.  I will definitely go back and recommend this to anyone.  Thanks for making fine dining more affordable.", "author": "Kat C."}

We also shared a bottle of Sangiovese. Everything tasted fantastic and at $35/person, very reasonable. They even made a special vegetarian dish for us. The service was just not that good. The wait staff seemed somewhat annoyed to be there and answer questions. The food also took so long to come out. Cool atmosphere though, was full the whole 3 hours we were there.", "author": "Manisha S."}

The tomato soup and risotto were standouts, but the falafel salad, ravioli, salmon, and schnitzel were all excellent as well.  I wasn't a big fan of the desserts, particularly the pot de creme - the bourbon whipped cream was a good idea in theory but didn't turn out that well.", "author": "Josh Q."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "description": "The service was excellent, but I wouldn't recommend this place if you're vegetarian.  I called ahead (the day before) to let them know that we had a reservation and were both vegetarian.  The person I spoke with said it wasn't a problem, but apparently forgot to pass the message along.  Our server was super nice about it and spoke with the chef, but the dish they prepared was a bowl of seasonal vegetables.  It was good, but a pretty small portion size (considering it was just vegetables), and it wasn't anything special.  The ambiance is nice, but our table was really close to the table next to us, so it kind of felt like we were dining together.  The desserts were both really good - definitely the highlight of the meal!", "author": "Sapna M."}

The staff was so friendly and warm, and the service was more attentive than I have seen in a while. You might think with a prix fixe menu that dessert would just be an afterthought, but both desserts on the menu were hands down fabulous, and I am a picky person when it comes to sweets. The decor was also beautiful. I will definitely be returning for the exciting, changing menu!", "author": "Chloe A."}

My boyfriend and I have been here twice in the past few months and both times the food has completely blown us away. The quality of ingredients and the care in preparation are unlike anything we've experienced before- especialllllllllly at this price point. I can't stress this enough- this $35/$45 prefix is worth double, maybe triple that. I love that the menu always changes, both times I went were completely different menus which is so much fun. Never skimp on the pasta course. And just in case you were wondering the salmon has been my favorite dish. I also can't rave enough about their affordable wine list. Why don't more places do this??? Trestle really nailed this. The ambiance is intimate and romantic. The service is superb. We had the same waiter both times and he remembered us!! Always such an unexpected and wonderful surprise. I really can't say enough great things about this place. My new favorite restaurant in SF for sure.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Along with our dinner, we had two bottles of wine and three coffees at the end. Food was great, and the service by the servers were also great. One star is for this arrogant, I think maybe he was a manager person. We didn't even finish our coffee and he came over to our table saying \"there's a group of people that has been waiting for 30mins, do you want to order more coffee?\" First of all, I was sitting facing the front door and people were NOT waiting for half an hr.. And I looked around and outside, there were 3 empty tables and one group of people waiting outside with drinks. I'm sorry but on a Saturday night, restaurants get packed and it's not abnormal for people to have to wait a bit for their tables. And Yes, granted we were chatting it up but who doesn't do that when they are out for dinner with friends? That was very rude and I've never had anyone actually tried to kick me out like that. I'm also in a service industry so I know how frustrating it could get when people hog the table, but we didn't even finish our coffee yet!!!!??? And this isn't like an AYCE place with time limits! I woulda understood if we finished everything and just kept on talking, but that wasn't the case at all..He was so rude.. other than his arrogance and poor POOR customer skills, it was a good experience.", "author": "Lolo P."}

We were looking for a new place to try after the theatre last Sunday afternoon and had heard good things about so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant is small and has a slight urban feel. The service was great, especially David, who went out of his way to ensure we had everything we wanted. Another female server guided us gently in making our decision as to how many pasta dishes to order for the table. She was spot on. Then there was the food...delicious! I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant. Give it a try!", "author": "Lynn L."}

A warm welcome with two glasses of champagne along with an intimate, modern ambiance. The friendly staff.. truly amazing, some of the best service I've ever had. The prix fixe menu allowed us to explore every dish - things I generally wouldn't know to order were absolutely delicious (expanding our palettes!). My favorites; tomato soup starter, corn risotto (supplement but worth it!) and the pork schnitzel. We finished up with the Bananas Foster Brownie and the Brown Butter Financier for a delicious desert to end the night. We'd recommend to anyone and can't wait to try the next menu!", "author": "Michael D."}

The short rib was delicious, but not enough to overcome not being able to have a comfortable conversation.  The 2 scallop entree was tasty, but more like an appetizer.  The overall dining experience was not enough for a return visit.", "author": "Martin C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-13", "description": "I went to Trestle last Friday night (5/8) with a group of five friends, and we were all blown away with the ambiance, service, food, and beer and wine selection. I love that the $35 prix fixe menu (starter, entree, dessert) changes daily, and is seasonally oriented. Between the five of us we ordered everything on the menu, plus we added two orders each of the two optional pasta courses, which were brought to our table family style. After trying literally everything on the menu, I can't say that there was anything I would make better or change on the menu. The corn chowder was better than I've ever had, and the Branzino was cooked to prefection. I was totally surprised to have pasta that contends with best in North Beach, the bolognese with\nburrata and chili oil was loved to death by our entire table. I can say that it's truly liberating to make all the ordering/food decisions upfront, and especially when you're with a bigger group. Our dinner had such a relaxed vibe to it, because we all knew that everything was taken care of, from starters to dessert. We ended up spending more time cruising the beer and wine list, and ordered some lovely bubbles, rose, and sour beers to compliment each course. Trestle is also a super convenient spot for Marin folks who are looking to use the ferry, since it's only a 10 min walk from the ferry terminal. I'm totally looking forward to my next visit!", "author": "Michaela B."}
