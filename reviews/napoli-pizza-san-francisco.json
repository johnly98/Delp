I'm actually kind of surprised that not a lot of places were open after 11PM...c'mon, isn't the city supposed to be alive with the smells of drunchies?\n\nNapoli's delivers delicious and ENORMOUS pizza for an affordable price, but that's all good if you can overlook the nasty lack of upkeep of the shop. The standing countertops are sticky and disgusting...don't touch the marbletop unless you have a layer of clothing between you and the table. There were a few other people who looked like they just left the club and were waiting for their $4.00 slice of goodness.\n\nI got the veggie pizza but substituted the black olives for pesto--BEST DECISION EVER. There's no extra fee to sub a topping, so Napoli's gets two thumbs up for keeping it affordable. I was shocked to see that there were two young boys manning the phone and keeping watch on the cash register...yo, it's 11PM...aren't you supposed to be at home fast asleep? Question marks a-plenty for their parents who are probably running the restaurant. This place is clearly family-owned, so that makes this grimy shop seem less disgusting.\n\nDelicious and large pizza slices for $4.00--no complaints there. But there are some interesting figures that come out to eat here at night, so be aware of that. However, Napoli's is still in an OK area on Polk Street, but I wouldn't come here alone after 10PM.

The crust is very bready and, for me, it has just the right mix of ingredients (cheese, Italian sausage,pepperoni,salami and Canadian bacon. ). Some may think there is too much cheese. But for me, there is no such thing. The only thing I can complain about is that the smallest is a medium and their medium is actually very large. I can never eat more half and it doesn't hold up well for leftovers.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3ubf9a8\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3mnmqac\n\nCheeseburger and fries - This is a very basic burger. It is almost assuredly from a frozen patty. I would not order from them for just a burger. There are plenty of other places with much much better burgers. But if you are hungry for a great calzone and a burger. I've had worse.\n\nChicken wings - Their wings are very average. They are dry. They are not made in a traditional way where they are flipped in a sauce. The spice is a little bland. They could use more kick.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3n8jlko\n\nGarlic bread - This is actually not very good. It is basically just a soggy roll with some basic ingredients.

Pepperoni was fine but there were barely any mushrooms on the one I wanted to devour. The only other complaint was that their crust is a bit weak. Too fluffy and not much flavor. It's cool we aren't big fan of crust in general so no big loss but just a lot of waste... they should spread the sauce and cheese up higher to the edges I think.

It was very creepy, especially when I walked out of the bathroom and found him just standing there looking at all of us (God only knows what was going through his head).\n\nMy friend paid in cash (the total was $27 and she paid with two $20 bills). He gave her change but we realized after he left that he took $10 for himself as his tip, even after we had chipped in $5 for his actual tip...so he walked away with $15. I'm pretty sure he thought we were all totally drunk and wouldn't notice. We weren't drunk, just very tired/hungry after partying so unfortunately my friend that paid didn't notice the missing money from the change until the next morning. But any honest pizza guy would have given her back the right amount and then taken his tip before leaving.\n\nDo NOT order from these guys if it's between 1am-3am...they're probably going to hope you're drunk and/or high so that you don't realize they're ripping you off.

I realize that its location (close proximity to a number of popular drinking establishments) may cloud one's recollection, but I can honestly and confidently say this was the most dreadful pizza I've ever had.\n\nThis place is set up for failure from the get-go.  It's filthy, dingy, and I immediately noticed upon ordering that the area where the pizza is prepared is concealed from view - not a good sign.  I ordered a slice of San Francisco, and Greek.  After waiting over 10 minutes, which, considering we were one of two parties in there at the time, was far too long, we received our \"food\".  Words can't describe how ghastly and revolting the pizza was when we received it.  It's clear that all they do is bake a number of plain cheese pizzas, and then create your slices once they're ordered by, and I shit you not, literally piling the additional ingredients on top of the pre-made cheese slice, and putting it BACK into the oven.  The problem is, they make absolutely no effort to conceal the fact that this is what they're doing.  The applicable ingredients are literally PILED on top; so high, in fact, that it's impossible to eat a slice without the ingredients falling all over the place.  Not to mention, the fact that the pizza is essentially baked twice results in an already mediocre cheese pizza slice being further ruined.\n\nHonestly, people, stop abandoning all standards merely because you've been drinking.  There are infinitely better options on Polk, including pizza.  In a city that features actual pizza, like Tony's, there's no excuse for this crude, awful detritus.", "author": "Cameron Y."}

Their delivery is fast and makes for a good late night meal if in the mood.\nIn addition to pizza, there are other options as well such as sandwiches, pastas, or salads and are all worth trying.\nAlso, be aware of any deals or coupons available as they are really generous with their specials and can receive a free 2-liter soda! \n\nNapoli is a genuine pizza spot and should be tried out if your in the area.

The truth is I ordered my first time from here today and found it far superior to all the other midrange delivery pizza places here.  The crust is great and tastes homemade.  This it not some chain or cheap cardboard style crust.  The toppings were very generous, flavorful and a much higher quality that similar places.  The sauce was lovely....good flavor.  The price point is below all others in the area.  In short, the value here is the best you will find in NW SF.  In addition, the delivery man was very quick to arrive and friendly.  Order from here and get 25% better quality at 20% less cost.....and an awesome pizza!  The wings.....I thought they were great.  Expect very tender, soft, moist wings, not the harder ones you get in restaurants.  Just give this place a try.....it defies what I somewhat expected from a Tenderloin low priced pizza place.

The delivery people are very punctual and polite. Plus, the free 2 liter of soda is pretty sweet. My only hesitation here is their garlic bread. I love garlic, but found some bites to be overwhelmingly garlicy while other bites were pretty bland.

Their California special pizza has a great mix of veggies. And soda is only $1. Try getting that elsewhere.

In fact, I would take a frozen Tombstone or Pizza Hut pizza over it any day.\n\nHOWEVER, on a lazy and cold evening, we decided to order some \"other food\" on their menu and have it delivered. I can't remember if the minimum order for free delivery is $10 or $15, but either way it was worth it. She ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and I ordered the Lasagna. Both were the \"complete dinners\", which the menu says includes bread and butter, and salad.\n\nWhen the delivery guy came, we were hungry! But I wasn't expecting much, considering we didn't really like their pizza. We were pleasantly surprised! The salads that came with dinner were HUGE! We probably could have had those salads by themselves as meals! But the only downside is that they put the dressing on beforehand, which made the lettuce soggy, and there was just too much italian dressing. Next time, ask for it on the side.\n\nBread & butter was two huge slices of bread each (looked like sub sandwich bread, haha) and butter already on them, melted. Mmm. What can I say, I love me some carbs!\n\nMy lasanga was FANTASTIC. It was absolutely COVERED in cheese. That is to say, though, if you don't like cheese, don't get the lasagna, because it was cheesy. BUT I LOVED IT! That itself was huge, if I wasn't so damn hungry, it could have also been split into two meals.\n\nI tasted the spaghetti and meatballs, and it was pretty good too!\n\nAll in all, you can order the lasagna complete meal for $9 and actually split it into two or possibly even three meals (if you don't eat that much).

Come here often and leave happy.  It's a good quick bite before catching a movie at the AMC on Van Ness.  The characters that come in may be even be enough entertainment for one evening.", "author": "CAKE E."}

The delivery guy was very friendly too which was a bonus. We ordered a mushroom pepperoni. The ingredients tasted fresh and the crust is filling. Overall, the pizza isn't exceptional, but it's a solid choice for a neighborhood pizza. I'd rather support this local pizzeria than a chain one. A minus is that the location is in a slightly bad neighborhood which is why we prefer delivery.", "author": "Allison v."}

Not thin but not thick - kinda like Scarlett Johansson.  I like the Tijuana - sausage, bell pepps, onion, tomato, jalapeno.

No more but I must join the mass of people in saying how good the pizza is here. The Greek pizza (pesto, olives, feta) was so good I found myself craving slices of it every day that I was in town. The employees, several men who run the place, made for some friendly conversation as did some of the patrons, house-less people coming in off the street for a big slice of cheese pizza (2 bucks) paid for in change they collected outside. Standing at the counter and eating my pizza, provided me with much to observe in the way of a neighborhood pizza place and how people interact with it. Drunken wealthy spoiled brats would wander in off the street loudly and rudely. Some hard working janitors and deliverymen would come in at odd hours to get a meal and some rest. A few hipsters came in. I couldn't resist talking to them, since I have a distant loathing/masochistic fascination with that sub-culture. They were kind of intimidated and out of their element (they all betrayed southern or mid-western accents) but nonetheless complimented me on my hair and boots. I sampled their pizzas too, the San Francisco Pizza (basically the Greek but with meat on it) which was delicious and left, but not before realizing that the pizza place was providing me with more fun than all the tourist sights I had been to in San Francisco. I felt like I was in a sitcom and the pizza place was where assorted groups of characters hung out.

I wasn't expecting much, hence the generous 2 stars, but this was real low. Must say that I knew what i was getting into, but I need to voice this right about now. To ALL pizza by the slice joints in all cities everywhere, you gotta let go of this nasty practice, of taking an old slice of cheese that is basically lifeless, throwing a bunch of toppings on it, more cheese, and then in the oven for a minute. It's just gross. I'm thankful, i suppose, that you are not wasting any food, however, it's like, for real, I'm a nice lady, and you can save the leftovers for people who are a little less nice. Like those loiterers outside that told me they would like to eat my ass, while I was crossing the street, on my way in. Also, I will give you the benefit of the doubt, and recognize that a full pizza would probably be much higher quality, but for my quick slice fix, I will stick with Piccolo Italia on Larkin and O'farrell.
