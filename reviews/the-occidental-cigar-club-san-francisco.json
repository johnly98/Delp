Very low key vibe with many different types of background music, depending who is bar tending. No pretension. They have a very sophisticated and wide range of spirits, as well as local beer and wine. The cigar selection is not huge, but it does change from week to week. You can sometimes smoke cigarettes if that's your thing, but you shouldn't count on it.  \n\nWhat really makes this place special is what it is beyond fine cigars, whiskeys, and scotches. All five bartenders (who are actually owners) are very different and unique personalities. I have had long and wonderful conversations with each of them. In addition, the clientele is very diverse, not just racially, but in terms of interests, politics, and other. I have met the most interesting people here and have had very insightful conversations with many of them. I often learn something new.  It's not cheap, but it is well worth a visit.", "author": "George B."}

I am a member of a few cigar lounges and decided to try this bar/lounge. When I first arrived I ordered a simple rum on the rocks.  I ordered a second drink and it was different. The bar tender told me I might want to finish that drink. After asking for the tab I now know why. He informed me that I asked for some 30 year rum and that is why I had 8 $50 charges. You would think the bartender would inform a customer that they were paying for a $400 glass of rum and most would probably decline. I enjoy rum and can't even remember the last time I seen even a bottle of rum that was over $400. He must be getting a commission or pocketing the money. Stay far away!!!!!\n\nUPDATE: I went to my financial institution and found out the establishment tried to charge my card 4 transactions of $79, 2-$279 transactions and a 1-$479 transaction. Glad my bank caught onto this establishment trying to over charge. I urge all to stay away unless you want to get ripped off by this bar.", "author": "Jason D."}

No cigarettes, not allowed.  \n\nAs an alcoholic, I noticed a huge selection of spirts and wine. Truly a well thought out array of unique top shelf choices. The beer list is equally extensive and fairly priced. Even the non-alcoholic offerings feature Fever Tree from the UK. \n\nNot expecting to enjoy a smoke and not bringing a favorite, I chose an Aston Corona, is mild and has a smooth draw. With the fatter gauged cigars, I prefer a punch rather than a cut. I think it provides a boulder taste.

Based on pictures alone, it reminded me of speakeasy type place. And it did not disappoint. To assist with the speakeasy type of feeling, I arrived to find a 1937 Buick parked out front. While it did not belong to the Occidental staff it definitely helped set the mood for my entry into the bar (more on the car later). \n\nOnce inside I found the place to be more of a bar (which allows cigars) versus being a true cigar bar. That said, it was nicely laid out with an ample amount of bar stools/tables along with seating at the bar. The typical leather sofa/lounge chair seating found at most cigar bars was nowhere to be found. Although the front door was open, the ventilation system seemed to be decent. There are also a couple of TVs which at the time were showing sports. \n\nAs I already mentioned, this is less a cigar lounge and more of a bar that sells cigars. There is a small humidor which contained some very nice high end sticks. Considering what was available, I thought the prices were acceptable ($20 for good cigars and closer to $30 for the really good ones). Also, outside cigars can be brought in. There is a $5 cutting fee for them. There was one bartender on duty. He was friendly and did a great job of keeping up with the various orders. \n\nLastly, as I mentioned there was a 1937 Buick parked out front which was in pristine condition. Approximately 20 minutes after I arrived, the owner walked in. He was dressed the part; long trench coat, fedora, double-breasted suit and two tone lace up shoes. I share this as it helps to highlight the the ambiance of Occidental; sort of a Roaring Twenties/Thirties feel. I thoroughly enjoyed the bar and will definitely return on my next visit to the area.", "author": "Willis C."}

Nicotine addictions are hard to kick, and it was his birthday after all -- he wanted a pack of cigarettes, I had made plans to take him here; it all worked out perfectly! \n\nThe shop is small, but more of a cozy small rather than a overcrowded small. The setup is similar to one you would find at your typical bar, with the bartender/owner behind the counter helping you. It's very dark here, but I like it... It felt like I was in one of those 1920's black/white romance movies (haha, half-kidding..) \n\nWe didn't really know much about cigars so we left it up to the guy who runs the place to pick one with the whiskey we ordered. Given this task, he walked over to one of his several glass cabinets where he picked one up for us. It was a really fun experience, but I wish that he had spoken to us a bit more, or at least told us what cigar he had chosen and why. \n\nFinal thoughts: I'd definitely come back, but only after maybe studying up/dabbling in smoking cigars a bit more.

STAY AWAY\n\nI have never been so offended in any public bar/restaurant in my life. I must provide that I have frequented this cigar bar a few times, without Yvette working, and I had a great time when Thomas is tending the bar. Great guy.\n\nAlright, back to the bad and there is a ton of it. I stopped into Occidental to have a cigar one day after work. (Yvette works on Mondays and Tuesdays....DO NOT VISIT ON THESE DAYS). I sat at the bar and waited to be served. Whatever Yvette was doing on her phone was much more important to her than even pretending to care to provide any type of reasonable service. After she shuffled over to me, being obscenely disgusted that someone was at her bar, she served me. After having a sip or two, two regulars came into the bar. Let me preface this next statement by acknowledging that I understand how 'regulars' work at a cigar bar.\n\nWith that out of the way, Yvette looked at me and said \"You need to move and sit in the seat behind you.\"\n\nI couldn't believe she said this to me. I have never been so appalled by someone that has no right to have any type of arrogance towards another person.\n\nThis isn't the first time that I have experienced or seen her wrath.\n\nHere's the deal. She's part-owner of the place. She thinks she can do what she wants, and she does, and it has no negative consequences on the bar. I feel awful for the other owners that they must tolerate her actions and bring-down what could be a decent cigar bar.\n\nYvette knows that there are no other locations to smoke cigars in the city. Therefore, she treats the patrons however she desires. However, if you are one of Yvette's friends, you're in for a treat! You're actually treated like a human being.\n\nIf you want better service.

Though I used to live in SF long before the place opened in 2001, I still travel there often and frequented the place regulatory particularity after the smoke ban a few years after.\n\nThe two older gentleman behind the, I assume owner operators, consistently treated me with respect over the years. As I know both my smokes and brown liquors, they were smart and concise with great suggestions. Service was intuitive and never pushy. Though I am usually in there with small groups, I did have many followers a few nights during Super Bowl week but no issues.\n\nHowever, I was in there on a Monday night earlier this year and encountered a dark haired woman behind the bar. Slow night, seemingly regulars only. I had never seen her in there before. She was not friendly at all and very brief. That, in and of itself, was no problem as I was in there after a long day, alone, not looking to talk or socialize. Then, her attitude devolved beyond aloof toward disdain almost anger. No idea why. I was as quit and detached as she was, I just wanted my drink and a smoke. \n\nMe wanting to pay in cash rather than use a credit card seemed to irritate her. She took forever to take my order. Barked out her request for a $5 cigar cutting fee which I have NEVER been asked for in all my year's visiting. I get how those types of \"charges\" can be applied at the owner/operators discretion, but I was clearly being treated much differently by this woman compared to the two other guys I was familiar with. She did not service me at my table at all while I was there (again, small crowd), I emptied my own ashtray, not problem in isolation, but while she saw doing this, she never came back to bring me a clean one thought I was still smoking.\n\nOrdinarily, I would have told her to F*&K OFF and left but, those spots are limited and I needed my after-work ritual which I was not going to let her ruin. So I stayed.\n\nBut that may be the end of a long run between and OCC. Whoever that was behind the bar that night cost the business money at the end of the day.", "author": "Ralph G."}

But, a good spot for San Fran as long as you are not expecting a quiet cigar and comfortable seating.\n\nBig plus is that it is open on Saturday afternoons!  I came in again and it was peaceful. The bartender was great. Music was great. I think it was the Pandora David Bowie channel. They were out of the brandy I wanted and she gave me tastes of two high end brandies and a bas Armagnac. They have a great selection of whiskey, port, and cordials. Several very good wines from boutique vineyards.

As everyone can see, the reviews seem good and I wanted to try one of their higher end cigars.\n\nWe find some parking and head in only to be confused by the fact there isn't anyone behind the bar. Someone who sounded cheerful enough said hello, but I wasn't sure who that was in the dark interior. My wife pointed out that I didn't seem to know what was up in the place and I pointed out to her that I hadn't been there before. This was apparently RIGHT BEHIND the person who works there, who ignored this statement.\n\nMy wife sits down at one of the small tables and waits patiently while I peruse the cigar selection, a VERY small cabinet humidor. The only thing that makes up for the small size of the humidor is the, admitted, quality of the sticks. I am not sure if they are kept well, as things went further downhill from there.\n\nAfter I decide on what cigar I want, I looked around for a bartender/tobacconist to assist me. No one appears, no one behind the bar. I look over at the end of the bar and notice someone folding something and assume that they work there. I migrate my way over to their area of the bar and they tell me, \"I am doing something right now, the cigars are at the end of the bar. I will be with you when I have a second.\" \n\nAs far as I could tell, all she was doing was folding stuff and chatting with someone. No money was exchanging hands, drinks being served, cigars being cut, and so on. \n\nAs it appeared that she was too busy to serve us, we decided to leave and not spend any money in this establishment. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't recommend this club to anyone.", "author": "Jon F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-27", "description": "We were excited to try this cigar bar, especially considering there are only a few of them in the area. We walked in and were greeted by an unattended bar; however, a patron warmly approached us and told us that the bartender had to step out and would be back shortly. About 10 minutes later, the bartender shows up and asks us what we'd like to drink. In the middle of the conversation, another patron walks up to the bar and she quickly dismisses our conversation and leaves us in mid-convo. \n\nWhile she's on the other end of the bar, the patron who approached us earlier asks her if she's tended to us and the bartender replies \"They don't even know what they want yet.\" When I heard that I responded by saying we've been ready to order and she says \"oh - well I'll come over once I'm done.\" \n\nAfter a few more minutes she comes over and asks us what we want to drink. My friend makes it a point to address the fact that she walked off while we were still trying to order and she immediately gets defensive and tells us how this is an owner-operated bar and that she had an errand to run and is understaffed but she's here now - all with jarring attitude and piercing eyes. My friend responds and says \"considering that this is an owner-operated bar, you'd think that customers would be more appreciated.\" \n\nShe finally chills the freak out and comes to her senses and pours us a glass of their Angel's Envy Occidental Bourbon (they ran out of their signature Blanton's) and proceeds to grab a Padron Aniversario 1926 cigar for my friend. The bourbon is smoother than your normal Angel's Envy, and the cigar was good as expected (not dry or poorly kept). The bartender actually makes up for our little \"tiff\" earlier and becomes more welcoming and attentive, checking on us and recommending bourbons (I tried the Black Maple Hill compared to the Balcones Baby Blue - the former had a lot of bite from beginning to end; the Balcones was much smoother). \n\nOverall, the bar has a good bourbon and scotch selection as well as a decent selection of cigars to choose from. The ambience is dark, smoky, classy - like something you'd familiarize with the 60s. However, it's become quickly apparent that locals are definitely more welcome and more tended to than out-of-towners.", "author": "Kimsua L."}

There are no comfortable sitting areas typical to a cigar bar and it is a very cramped and poorly ventilated space. We decided to give it a go and grabbed the two open stools, only for the bartender to be immediately rude to us and yell at us for having outside drinks (water bottles). She did not tell us about the policy before she started raising her voice and acting annoyed. She then said we could finish them or toss them and then started making a grabby motion with her palm while going \"now, now\" while I was finishing mine. We handed them over to be trashed and then immediately left.

Sure, it's a $100 a pour, (NOT just because its the FiDi, but its quality at its finest) but to enjoy that sip for sip, and w/ your favorite cigar in the other hand, well I couldn't think of a better marriage.\n\nThe staff is very knowledgeable in their whiskeys, and even more so in their cigar selections; very fitting!  My favorite here is Yvette, she's a super smart cigar and whiskey connoisseur who is patient, willing, and able to find you the perfect drink to accompany your cigar.  \n\nIt's an old school bar w/ new school flair.  The ventilation is pretty well configured with large overhead fans whirring atop you at about every ten feet or so.  There are charging cables galore at the end of the main bar for all your phone and accessory needs.  There are cigar cutters, lighters, matches, and really anything you need right at your fingertips at the bar.\n\nYou cannot order directly from the bar; however if you're nice, the staff will give you a stack of recommendations from the eateries on the block and they will deliver it straight to your seat.  I love that this cigar bar is conveniently located within spitting distance of our office.  It really is a great place to just unwind when you need a few minutes to get away and just relax so you can get back to grinding it out. Even more so, after a long day when you can sit back and relax while the sweet stenches of the Macanudos and Drew Estate Kubas fill your lungs with finely rolled tobacco accented in herbs and spices.\n\nENVIRONMENT: Not for the breathing impaired.  This IS a CIGAR BAR!\nDRINKS: Not too shabby depending on strength and age of your drink.  I only order one.

Why not top an amazing meal with a celebratory cigar? We walked the 5-8 blocks from BIX and entered in a small bar, filled with cigar smoke and older gentlemen.  I tell my man to go pick out 2 of the finest cigars (to be honest, I never have had my own cigar before) and I order us 2 aged scotches. We settle by the window. I come back from the bathroom and my bf has made friends with a great chap from Toronto. We all start hamming it up and next thing you know shots of Prevette (spelling, actually name?). Prevette is this Jager type shot that is pretty nasty, similar to Jager, but, people drink lots of and is supposedly \"huge\" in San Fran.  We knock a few of those back. At this point we got a good little crew, a guy that runs a winery up north and my bf's homie from college. No ladies.\n\nI start dancin'. That happens to me... a lot. I got moves too. But, back to the story, I am the only lady in this bar at this point so, I am conjuring up some attention. I declare that its this handsome guys 30th bday (pointing to my bf) and all these gentleman (about 6 suited up guys post 40) all stand up and raise their glasses and toast my bf and tell him he's an old fuck and come over and pat him on the back and start talkin' shit.  It was hilarious. It was fun. It was random. It was overall a great time that probably wouldn't of happened anywhere but this place. No ladies.\n\nWe closed the place down to me twirling all around the bar post hours with my bf and his friend, jamming out hard to the music.  The bartender/owner who was an amazing sport through this whole evening with my drunken shenanigans was a delight, a pure delight. Schmokin' stoges with his customers and offering up a drink to those in need. \n\nThe next morning I was hungover and my clothes reeked like cigar smoke, my tokens from the night prior.

I ended up raiding her closet before the S.O. and our two friends went out, so I wore knit leggings and a suede and leather knit sweater. Basically, it was the bomb. \n\nOutside of awesome fashion, something that came out of the 80's was a penchant for going wild. Since my idea of a wild night doesn't involve copious amounts of cocaine (like the 80's), I decided a cigar bar would be as far as I could go. The suggestion was made and we walked right in. \n\nAdmittedly, I should have asked the bartender for a recommendation on a drink rather than just ordering four beers. I decided to get a vanilla cigar - COME ON - and smoked the rest of the night away while sipping on my beer. Not the most fantastic combination, but will do in a pinch when you've ingested enough alcohol to tranquilize an elephant (I'm convinced that in the 80's people drank beer to sober up). \n\nThe S.O. ordered up a fat cigar, but his review of it was not so stellar. Oh well! Hey, I liked the place. There aren't many establishments that still allow smoking ANYWHERE, shit, even Paris got a stick up their ass about it. When you imagine a Parisienne, you think - \"Beret. Striped shirt. Long, thin cigarette.\" How disappointing. \n\nI recommend coming here as a nightcap to going out on a special occasion. Word to the wise: If you decide to wear a 25 year old outfit in mint condition, be prepared to shell out major bucks to get Neiman Marcus to specially dry clean it, or you're going to get a mouthful of expletives when your mother asks how the outfits are doing (WHOOPS).", "author": "Jaime L."}

The bar is dark, compact, boasts a enviable shelf of whisky that just calls to you.  Clouds of thick, luxurious smoke rise from their collection of choice cigars.  I'll be honest, this is one of the quietest bars I've ever been to.  On the particular aftetnoon I was there, it was mostly solitary patrons either reading, writing or contemplating life.

I had a couple of friends from out of town and they were excited about smoking cigars so I obliged.  The place was quiet with a good amount of bar stools around (we were the loudest thing in the establishment).  I thought I would be annoyed with the smell and smoke but instead, I loved it.  It was a chill place with lots of alcohol and more importantly whiskey.  The boy got some whiskey for the guys, wine for me and a martini for my friend.  We spent an hour there and would've spent more if not for dinner.  \n\nThe bartender was helpful and the people there were really nice and easy to talk to.  It's one thing for the employees to be awesome but another thing for the other patrons to be equally as awesome; I believe it says something about the place.

Its a smaller place, very comfortable looking, great selection of bourbon, humidors full of fine quality cigars, and the lovely Yvette sitting at the counter laughing that we had walked past one time and then promptly turned around and came in.\n\nCigar selection is finely curated, they are reasonably priced and high quality. The selection of bourbon, like I said, is vast and equally as high quality. The atmosphere varies depending on day of the week and time, but it is always fun and comfortable. The customers range from older gentlemen who have been coming here for years, to the overdressed hipster.

That way customers aren't asking what I'm smoking and why it's not stocked in the humidor. This also prevents the owners from raising any hackles.\n\nPlus, it's a matter of person ethics.

The crowd quickly died off, however, and we were able to get a seat at the bar and looking around whilst I smoked said bone.\n\nImpressions - a very \"Norm!\" kinda neighborhood bar.  Small selection of smokes for those who didn't bring their own, and a good selection of wine and liquor.  Also a good choice of draft beers (Stella on tap...that was a star right there).    \n\nEnded up cutting the bone short, however (and MAN do I hate that)...for good reason.  This, unfortunately, is a bar that allows cigars...NOT a cigar bar (a HUGE difference!).  More than one completely soused idiot were present...and as one became more and more belligerent, it became obvious that he really wasn't going to calm down anytime soon...and rather by a bystander at a bar fight, we chose to go.\n\nStill on a quest for a real cigar bar in SF.

The place is cozy to say the least. It's actually rare even on weekends to see this place packed but it's not hard to do so. It isn't the kind of place that would be convenient for a large party or events. I personally have never inquired about private parties so I don't know about that one. There is a markup on the cigars that they carry here so if you don't bring your own be sure to remember what you're spending on the cigar, though as of late it is one of the better humidors in the city. It is also very much geared towards a male clientele so I would understand feeling apprehensive about bringing a lady friend with you. Finally, and while this is a criticism this is incredibly understandable considering the nature of the bar, you will come out of the place smelling like an ashtray. \n\nNow that we covered the negatives, let's talk about why you should come here and why you shouldn't let said negatives stop you. Though it is a relatively small place, there is almost always seating, the few exceptions is on game days and when there is some kind of event or business conference in the city. It is the last good place to find cigars in the city. They will let you eat there and have menus behind the bar of various good restaurants That deliver to this place, including the restaurant next door. All the bartenders are very friendly and are knowledgeable about the spirits and the cigars they can provide. Their selection changes around from time to time and they're always of good quality. Very nice atmosphere, unpretentious and full of tongue in cheek humor. One of the better selections of beers, wines, and fine spirits. One of the few places who pride themselves on good service but not stuffy. It has that hospitable, almost family feel to it.\n\nAll in all this place is a specialty bar and obviously the appeal of this place is not as universal as other bars strive to be, but of you want a good beverage to go with your cigar, have a good conversation about spirits, tobacco, or the nature of existence, maybe even catch a game or two then this'll be the place tailor made for your tastes.", "author": "Nicholas J."}

Its nearly a club but without the red tape and fees. Always good for a good laugh and an intriguing conversation. A good place to go alone and shoot the shit w/ the owners/bartenders or with friends. Its my guess that the average regular there has an IQ level of around 125 +. It is also not large enough to bring in the obnoxious crowds. The Occi is a real bar and one of the last real bars in San Francisco in my opinion. They have a condensed and complex stock of liquor and wines to cater toward anyones palate and the owners/bartenders take pride in knowing whats on hand.The smoke alone breeds out the prudes as well as the pretentious.

They asked me to at least make a purse out of one of them...  I think it's my turn to indulge them. \n\nKnowing you'll leave their bar smelling like cigars/smoke, Jake keeps a stock of Febreeze on hand.  He Febreezed me before I left the bar; it's an interesting process...  You should ask him about it when you visit to save your significant other from the pungent scent of the cigars.\n\nThe bar feels like Cheers.  All the patrons know each other and they're very welcoming to the newbies.  After I told them I just lost my job, they were all so willing to help me find a new one.

I usually bring my own cigars but they have some in a humidor for sale.  OK selection of cigars but not great.  That this is one of the very few places that allow smoking inside is huge.  We have spent many rainy happy hours here relaxing with a cigar and scotch watching people running by soaked and miserable.  After a cigar or two and twice that many drinks, it could have been snowing and we didn't care.\n\nThis is a great smoking bar but most of all it is a great bar.

They have a good bar with typical drinks for this type of bar (whiskey, scotch, cognac, etc.)  They even had a bottle of Lagavulin.  They have a limited selection of cigars that are only moderately well kept.  That doesn't sound like a good review but it was a fun place to hang out and smoke cigars.  This is a tiny place so don' t be surprised if it's crowded (we went by a couple of times).  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  Service is at the bar only which was perfectly fine with me.  They  don't have room for a humidor so the cigars are just stored in some glass cases which might result in less than ideal aging what with the doors being opened all the time when people are getting things out.  But at the rate they were selling, nothing probably sits there very long.  Cigar prices were high but probably reasonable for single sales in a large, expensive city.
