Orale Orale was the first place I tried.\n\nI was instantly skeptical of the fact that they charge for chips and salsa; $1.25 for chips, another $.30 if you want salsa to go with them. Typically, I've found that this is a sign of inauthenticity, but I was still willing to give them a shot.\n\nI got a supremo vegetarian burrito, which cost me almost $11 including the aforementioned chips and salsa. I gotta say, that's pretty steep, but if it's good food, I was willing to give them a break.\n\nWell, I am disappointed. A huge taqueria pet peeve for me is when the burrito is cold. The rice, beans, and other fillings were room temperature. The cheese was unmelted. It also lacked flavor; the rice was very bland, and I'm not sure if they even used salsa or pico de gallo - it tasted like diced tomatoes, which kinda reminded me of Taco Bell (sorry to have to go there, but it did).\n\nI would have forgiven the surcharge for chips if they were the cripsy, thin, classic taqueria style chips, but instead, they tasted like chips out of a bag. The salsa, however, was very good. I will give them that.\n\nLastly, the burrito was on the smaller side. I should never be able to finish a proper burrito in a single sitting, and I scarfed this one down in its entirety, even accompanied by the subpar chips.\n\nHence, my search for a new favorite Mexican spot will have to continue...", "author": "Kelsey S."}

I've eaten the burritos fresh and I've eaten the burritos after a few hours of sitting around, and I can't quite figure it out, but I really enjoy them after they've been sitting around for a few hours. Maybe it's because the juices from the meat are soaked up in the tortilla....? Lol, I do not know. But I do enjoy their burritos. \n\nI always have the Carne Asada Supremo Burrito... (or is Burrito Supremo?). The burrito comes with carne asada, rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, green onions, sour cream, and guac. I've tried coming here for lunch and had my burrito fresh and for some reason the meat is just not as flavorful. But still pretty good. I really like how you can taste the guac, which always tastes pretty fresh and I do like how they add green onions to their burritos. It makes the burrito different than the typical burrito. But their salsa is the absolute best! It's pretty spicy compared to other places I have been to. I would totally go here just to get the chips and salsa. I've also tried the breakfast burrito, which was okay. But that was probably my bad since I got the one with scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, and beans. Pretty basic, nothing special. I'm sure the other breakfast burritos on their menu are more exciting.\n\nThe place is fairly busy during lunch, so I suggest coming before the madness. I have had to wait for a while each time I've tried ordering at the counter for take-out. And sometimes I wish I got a little more salsa since I do like using salsa on every bite. I don't get any chips when I get my order to go, and I'm not sure if there is a minimum for that or what, but I do know that you get some if you dine-in. Anyway, the burrito is pretty solid. My friend enjoys the quesadilla, so maybe I'll give that a try next time.", "author": "Meghan J."}

General consensus was that it's fresh, tasty, and filling. The rice and beans are definitely negligible, but the carne asada was pretty close to perfect. Also, they're really flexible about customizing your toppings which is always appreciated. \n\nThe best part about this place was the service.

Obviously not as good as well-known Mission staples, but a safe bet for lunch downtown.  Heck, it's not uncommon to see some office workers sneak a Margarita or Tecate when dining in.\n\nBeef & Pork Chimichanga: Better than I expected.  A nice mix of ground beef and pork cubes for good meat texture contrast.  Some veggies mixed in like grilled peppers and maybe even lettuce.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.  It felt like just the right portion of deep fried burrito to be satisfying, but not to over stuff you and make you feel gross.  I like that the tortilla was fried on the outside but still a little soft on the inside so it didn't feel overly deep fried.\n\nBeans & Rice: Pretty standard refried beans and yellow rice.  Complemented the main dish, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat just these.\n\nNachos & Salsa: The salsa definitely tasted like it was made earlier in the day rather than a few days back.

That sauce on the burrito was delicious as well. The aroma just makes your mouth water.

The food though..perhaps I am too spoiled by the options we have in the SF Bay Area. In the future, I think I'll save myself for the Mission area, or Uno Dos Taco, if I want to stay in the Financial District.\n\nAnyway, the shrimp tacos were BLAND; the shrimp itself tasted boiled, overcooked and not seasoned at all. I had one bite of one taco and asked my bf to taste it too, to confirm it wasnt good. I tasted the black beans (okay) and rice (dry, tasteless). The server came by when she saw I wasn't eating any longer and asked me if I wanted to wrap it up to go. I said it was not very good, and asked if it could get taken off the check, gven I hadn't eaten 90% of it. Some guy comes over and says he will charge me for 1 taco since \"you ate it\". Hmmm okay. Ive never had a restaurant (not even the one I worked at) nickel and dime me on subpar food, especially when it's all still on the plate.\n\nMoving on, they took 3 dollars off the bill. The math does not work out, but I didn't really want to argue about it or wait any longer, so suffice to say, we will not come here again or recommend anyone else to. $40 for two drinks, 1 taco (yea, sure) and enchilada plate PLUS the price of my actual lunch.

A co-worker and I were feeling some Mexican food and this was the closest thing to a cantina we could find online. We went and ordered a burrito and an enchilada plate. I look for a table. Apparently this place runs separate registers for dine-in and to-go, although we were never asked anything of the sort. \n\n\"Hey!\" he barks, \"You have to wait over there for a table\" and gestures to the same area in which we stood while ordering food. Awkwardly we spin around and try to intermingle with the crowd still ordering. Three tables are open and set-up, with no other parties in the jumble of patrons seemingly waiting. \"Would it be okay if we sit here?\" I ask a busboy. \"You can't eat here!\" Mr. Oaf toss in. I'm surprised he's still listening, but it seems like we are his new hobby. \"We already ordered\" my friend responds, \"now we are just waiting or a table.\" \n\n\"You ordered to-go, you can't eat here. There are two separate sides, the signs are there for a reason!\"\n\nBemused, confused, ultimately pissed off, i wait for him to call our number, grab our sub-par food, and gear back into the cold winter streets. \n\nP.S. the carne asada burrito: steak tastes okay, but it was mostly bland avocado mash and super wet beans. Souper-wet. I've had pho with less juice than this burrito. Not delicious steak grease mixed in with the salsa. Just weird, undrained bean juice. Gross. \n\nAnd they put lettuce in their breakfast burritos. Wtf. \n\nTo the oaf: you're a jerk and that was completely unnecessary.", "author": "Nick K."}

And wanted to eat somewhere close by. His suggestion was this Mexican place. \n\nFOOD: \nSupreme burrito. There's something lacking here. If it wasn't for the burrito doused in sauce it would've been quite a plain burrito. Ton of beans. No guac. Pretty huge burrito. Served on cheap colorful plates. You've got to use a knife and fork to eat it with because it's pretty much a wet burrito. Come here when you're hungry, you get GIGANTIC portions. Probably best to call in your order or get it to go. \n\nSERVICE: \nAsked us what we wanted to drink right when we sat down. However, we didn't know if we were supposed to seat ourselves or ask for a table. So we stood there dumbfounded for a minute before someone told us that we could sit anywhere. I think it's seat yourself if there's no one there, and wait in line if there's a ton of people there. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nYou got your mom and pop looking place. With a bunch of wooden old school tables and checkered table clothes with glass on top. \n\nTIP: the best time to go during the weekdays is before 11:30.

My coworker said good things about the baby burrito, saying it was sizable even for being the smallest burrito you can order. \n\nPlaced a phone order for pick up and asked them to hold the rice and add guacamole and salsa, and the very nice lady on the phone said it would be ready in less than five minutes. \n\nImmediately after hanging up I went downstairs and down the block and when I walked in my burrito was already ready. Taking it back to the lunchroom in my building and unwrapping it, I was surprised by how generous of a burrito it really is. For only $4.25 you get a ton of meat (I ordered the chicken) and ingredients - but this is definitely as messy as it gets. Multiple-napkins-required messy. And I reveled in every bite.\n\nThe chicken was flavored wonderfully, and the salsa and guacamole combined with the pinto beans made this an incredibly delicious, cheap dinner. With the added toppings and a can of soda my total came out to $7.30. I'm still savoring the flavors left behind. My menial complaint: not enough guacamole. It was definitely there, but there wasn't quite enough for the whole burrito.\n\nSeriously one of the best burritos I've ever had, and it's a fantastic deal that left me full but not stuffed.

I'll try to keep this brief as I will not be wasting any of my time or thoughts on this place ever again.\n\nAte there with my family last week and had the WORST service I've ever experienced anywhere.  To be fair, my wife did have the audacity to ask the server (who I believe is one of the managers/owners) if he could check on our food (we'd been waiting for about 15 minutes and, if you've ever been here, you know they move you through fast).  The manager barely glanced at her and said, \"Yeah, it's coming up\" as he pointed to the kitchen.  It went downhill from there.\n\nMy wife ordered the grilled tilapia and it came out dry (obviously cooked too long).  When she commented to the  server that it was dry he didn't miss a step as he flew past our table - he said, \"put some lime on it...\" in a voice that left no doubt that he was irritated and didn't have time or patience for his customer.  My burrito was hardly better (and I have always loved the food here).\n\nThe manager who was obviously miffed at us never came back, but as we were preparing to leave, my wife did stop him to say that the fish was the worst she had ever had (since he never stopped to ask how the food was, or if there was anything else we wanted, she had to bring it up to him).  Now, I can understand that he might not like hearing this, but that's no excuse for what ensued.  He launched into a ridiculous defense of the poor preparation, indicating that she shouldn't expect grilled fish to be moist (really?  Um, we've had plenty of grilled fish and, if cooked properly, it should be moist).  He argued with her until she said, \"I'm the customer and you shouldn't treat customers like this!\" He ended up shouting at both her and my son and insulted us before storming off.\n\nI don't care how good the food and service has been in the past, I will never be going back.

She had stomach cramps and I felt nauseous afterwards. \n\nThis place is definitely a little overpriced for your classic greasy Mexican food. But for those of us who are too lazy to spend an extra 15 minutes making our way to the Mission, this is what we get. Sub par, overpriced burritos/enchiladas/tacos sitting in a pool of liquid-y beans, yum.\n\nThe upside? Service was friendly and the meal tasted good in that junk-food-grease-heavy kind of way while we were eating it. It's just the aftermath that might be a little more unpleasant. I hate to seem hypocritical but having said all of that, I have an inkling that I'll be back here.

As a customer, I feel that it would only be courteous for restaurants to let customers know what they are charged for and the amount for each item (correct me if you feel differently on this as a consumer).\n\nI called this restaurant and have asked the manager why I was never given an itemized receipt and the answer I received went like this: \"Well, we're very old fashioned and we just enter in the amounts and throw away the receipts\".  I don't know how the rest of you feel about this, but I wasn't happy.  My order was around $300 by the way.  I insisted in getting a receipt for what I have ordered (for reconciliation purposes) and the manager answers, \"Well, I can't give that to you.  What I can do is make up something for you.\"  ... hmm, I don't know how I feel about having a made-up receipt (that probably has nothing to do with what I've ordered).  He then brushes me off saying that his shift was going to end in another 30 minutes ... I don't know where \"good\" customer service plays a role here, but I definitely do not see it.\n\nI tried calling times after that but had no luck.  At one point, an employee who answered the phone hung up on me THREE times.  You're the one at fault and you're going to hang up on your customer ... awesome.\n\nI had to literally walk over to their store to talk to them face to face for me to get my (made-up) itemized receipt and had to harass them by phone to get my (obviously again, made-up) itemized receipt for my second order.\n\nWay to go, Orale Orale.

They take all credit cards which is a plus for me and often influences if I come back. The burrito was a decent size but a little \"squishy\" and not firm compared to other places. Semi loose/tightly wrapped if that matters to you. It got a little sloppy at the end as a result. The chicken is shredded. I prefer grilled. The guac and salsa and rice and beans were a little \"soupy\" inside the tortilla. Doesn't bug me a whole lot but I'm just giving a description. You don't get chips (but you do get one small container of salsa to go), which I think should be an automatic. Chips are an extra cost to go but free if you dine in.

It was good enough to be worth the price.\n\nThe last two times I went, however, the burritos were about 1/2-3/4 the size they used to be. Literally. It used to be when I'd get a burrito I could eat half for lunch, take the other half home for dinner. I'd get chips, too, so it was perfect. I'd be satisfied, but not stuffed full. (They charge for chips if you get them to go. If you sit down, you get chips for free.) When I went a few months ago, I thought it must be a fluke - they just were having one of those days. I went today, and sure enough, small burrito. Definitely not worth $9. Which pretty much sucks, because the shredded beef supremo was pretty decent.\n\nWon't be returning.", "author": "Chloe J."}

It's located just across from Embarcadero Center 3.\n\nThe good:\n- Cheap, authentic Mexican food. Most dishes were between $8 - $12.\n- The rice and beans were really good. They sprinkle melted jack cheese over your beans, which I love :)\n- Chips and salsa are yummy - the salsa is spicy and fresh made with chunks of tomato, jalapeno and onion\n- Fast service (once you're seated)\n- Portions are generous\n\nThe not-so-good:\n- Long wait to be seated\n- My fish tacos ($8.95) were okay, but I've had better. The fish itself didn't have much taste, so much of it came from the sauce.\n- Seating is cramped so you won't have much elbow room.\n- They don't sell Mexican drinks like horchata, agua de Jamaica (hibiscus juice) or agua fresca. Just soda or alcoholic drinks. For me, that's a big deal because I don't drink soda. And I also can't get boozed during my lunch break. So I just had water.\n\nTips:\n- There are two lines here. The one on the left is to be seated. The one on the right is for to-go orders.\n- It gets packed really early, so get there early or late to avoid a wait. We were there at 11:40am on a Thursday and had to wait til noon to be seated.\n\nOverall, it's a decent place for cheap Mexican food. I give it 3 stars. Of course, I'm also a harsher judge of Mexican food than the average person (for obvious reasons).\n\nOrale!", "author": "Mariela D."}

I have had a chicken baby burrito, a carnitas taco (I hear they only have carnitas on Thursdays), and a shredded crispy chicken taco. \n\nEverything so far has been good. I love the concept of the baby burrito. At only $3.50, it's a great deal for when you are just a little hungry and don't need a big 'ole burrito. Their shredded chicken is juicy and flavorful, unlike I have had elsewhere (shredded chicken can sometimes be bland). I am pretty much hooked on their shredded chicken crispy tacos at this point. Even though it's not listed on the menu, they have no problem with me ordering just one or two a la carte (instead of with beans and rice) - makes a great afternoon snack that won't spoil my dinner. The carnitas was also moist and juicy, although I did find a bit of fat in it. I prefer my meat without hunks of fat, but there was just a little bit, so not a big deal. \n\nI am picky about my Mexican food and will not settle for mediocrity. This place, from what I have had so far, is definitely better than average. Your food comes out quickly too. I agree it's kind of odd they charge for chips, but then again, most of the time unless I am dining in, I don't eat them anyway, so that works for me. I look forward to trying more menu items....I will definitely be back. Oh yeah, and Chipotle around the corner's got nothing on this place.

They serve good portions and their burritos are very tasty. They are a very popular place, deservedly so in my opinion. Service is lighting fast - and I mean really fast...so fast that you start to wonder how they were able to prepare your order so quickly. Again, it's all part of the mastery of highly efficient rush hour service.

The food is consistently excellent and the service is friendly and attentive, and prices are very reasonable. As a lawyer who has worked in the financial district for the last ten years, I have eaten at Orale at least one hundred times, so I really know their food well.  Truth be told, if I were writing this review in Tucson, AZ, it would not be five stars, it would be at most a four, but we are in San Francisco where there is a dearth of good Mexican food anywhere but the Mission, where I rarely have time to go.  There is no better Mexican anywhere near the financial district, so I give it five stars. My favorites are the beef taquitos, ceviche tostados, green sauce enchiladas, taco platter, and the steak ranchero. I like the burritos as well, and the margaritas are yummy and not expensive.

I happened to be in the mood for a burrito so I figured I would check them out. It ended up being one of the worst customer service experiences ever. The lady at the counter didn't even acknowledge me until I stood at the counter for literally 5 minutes. She just continued to look down until I spoke to her. When I asked her about the menu (they have several choices for burritos) she acted as though she didn't understand me or she didn't want to. And if she did in fact have a language issue, i would have been totally fine with that had she been pleasant about it. \n\nAs for the food, I have to say it wasn't totally bad but only \"so so\". I got the Carne Asada with a side of chips and salsa. The burrito itself lacked a bit of flavor but was still decent. I was hoping to enhance the flavor with the salsa. However, the salsa ended up tasting like plain tomato sauce. I literally pictured a big jar of plain Prego behind the counter as their source of this stuff. Thank goodness I got my food to go. I happened to love salsa and had a substitute at home. And as for the chips, they were  a bit stale.\n\nIn closing, I have to say that I don't normally leave Yelp messages but I really value customer service.

You can get a burrito for $5 and its stuffed with cheap greasy beef. Many of the Mexican restaurants in San Francisco are more true Mexican food.

I got the carne asada supremo, which came with guac/sour cream which is essential to any burrito. The tortilla they use is a little flimsy and tends to fall apart as it gets soggy from soaking up the grease and juice. \n\nThe service was great. Caters to a lot of lunch time office workers so it gets backed. Theres are separate lines for take out and seating. They workers are fast and friendly which was a big plus to this place.

If it's any indication of how good a place is by how packed they are, forget about going after 12pm.  Lines are out the door.

That is CHEAP by Financial District standards!   And when it's described as \"supremo,\" you betcha it's a big one!  They also have an excellent chicken omelet with the works - I usually have them hold the beans (definitely not a bean person), and add extra rice & hash browns to the order.  So big I don't usually need to eat until dinnertime.  (Note: they do charge an extra 20% after 10:30am for breakfast items.  Only found out from reading the fine print!)\n\nOrale's is so good that whenever I order, I have to bring an extra back to my husband.  We normally don't eat a lot of Mexican food , because they are all chains out here in our area, like Chili's - yuck - so this is a treat.

I single-fingeredly? am writing this review as I slowly drift into what I fondly refer to as \"flavor coma\". Other less refined patrons may refer to this as a food coma. But I say NAY, this is more...much much more.\n\nThis morning as my co-worker and I went for \"walkies\" around the financial district we came across this tiny, hole in the wall, never heard of, I guarantee they re-use the chips type mexican restaurant. And let me tell you my friend, the smell alone brought my appetite to life. Thus, we made the calculated decision to leave for lunch a bit early to beat the rush of other, like-minded patrons but unfortunately our plans were foiled by that oh so evil...job. I can't believe my \"job\" actually expects me to \"work\" when I'm here. Preposterous! \n\nBut I digress. As we came upon this establishment (finally) we found a long line out the door, but chose to wait it out. The line moved rather quickly, as people went in, ate and left without delay. Mainly no one delays after finishing their meal due to the dozens of pairs of eyes burning into the back of their heads with resentment for making others wait longer.\n\nOnce we were seated we were immediately served salsa, chips, and agua. (that's water for all you ignoramusses....usssss haha) The salsa was sooo good and the gravy boat it comes served in is an added bonus to the decor. Salsa was spicy enough to make a girl cry. And the best part? They refill your chips and salsa like THAT. *hopelessly tries to snap and fails*\n\nWe both ordered the tostada salads, his with beef, mine with chicken. The food arrived fairly quickly and there was so much of it. The chicken couldv'e been more flavorful but the dish was definitely worth the price. For $8 I was soo stuffed that I had to get a to-go box, and so did my co-worker (and he usually eats twice as much as me). \n\nThe service was excellent, the waiters are all running around at lightning speed replenishing chips and salsa. My one and only con: the chips are stale and I think re-used. It looked as if they simply picked up the bowl of chips when a table was done, put it in the pile with all the other chip bowls, and gave you a different bowl--therefore creating the illusion of \"new\" and \"fresh\"", "author": "Scooby D."}

My favorite dish is combination #5 -- a corn tortilla flauta stuffed with chili verde pork, and a perfect chili relleno.  I don't suggest the fish tacos -- they are not what this place is known for.

I'm pretty much strapped to my cubicle everyday trying to race deadlines, and almost everyday I don't eat until 2pm.  So I look forward to that end of the week where I catch up on lost calories... I look forward to Burrito Days.\n\nI've shopped around the FiDi, North Beach, and I'll peek around Chinatown at times (Mushu pork is close, but the Chinese just aren't fond of guac) for that perfectly wrapped meat, rice, and fat.    But Orale Orale has been constant and a big favorite of mine.  There are 2 lines (table service and takeout) in here everyday and both are often out the door.  Don't bother looking at their extensive menu of yummy lardy goodness.  Just go for a burrito.  Celebrate Burrito Day with me.  Yours can even fall on a Monday if you like.  \n\nWhat is the exception here?  Say it with me -- \"But-ta rice.\"  Ok, it really isn't rice with butter, but it has a lovely yellow hue to it and it's super moist.  I am guessing it was made with saffron.  The meats are juicy and they aren't sitting under a heatlamp where the marinade is drying out.  I do have to warn you that the pork can be rather chunky so grab a fork and dig in when need be.  But you'll find a nice suprise in the end, because all the meat juice, sauces, and spices have now pooled in at the bottom.  Those last 3 bites are heavenly... and a little messy.  Do like a hamster and suck on the bottom.  No wasting, k?\n\nAnd one element they've mastered is the wrapping.  I've had some really gnarly \"burrito knots\" where the tortilla has been wrapped over so many times that it creates a big bundle that kills the the entire burrito texture.  I want to sink my teeth where it closes in, not stop midway in order gnaw at that damned knot.  So keep it loose!\n\nHave a happy Burrito Day!", "author": "Chris T."}

I had to eat it with a FORK. what kind of quesadilla has to be eaten with a fork?? Tastewise it was okay, but it was also so greasy and fatty that after two slices I couldn't eat any more and just threw the rest of it out. After that I saved the taquitos for lunch the next day. It was a little better, because after being in the fridge overnight, the taquito tortilla shells had harded enough that i could actually eat it without it falling apart on me. I always thought taquitos were like.. long thing cylinders though. These were more like fatty short rolls. The gross part was that there was a ton of sour cream in my box, and overnight it had become...a solid block. Does sour cream normally do this?? While I was eating, my food thawed out (I don't reheat my leftovers...haha) and then the taquito got oozy and fall-aparty again, but the sour cream was still solid.\n\nI'm sad caus this place is so close to where I work, but it was really not worth it.

I also notice that there's always a long line coming out of this place during lunch time so I had a pretty big breakfast and got there after 1pm and although there were a ton of people eating inside, there wasn't a line for take out.\n\nI ordered the enchiladas combo.  They were OK and I really loved the salsa they gave me.  I do agree that the food is not bad but it's also not spectacular or really great....just OK.  They do give huge portions and it's pretty cheap considering all of the surrounding places that charge an arm and a leg for lunch.  \n\nI'll have to try something else when I feel like going back.

Alive with hustle, bustle and the warm crackle of a thousand handheld data devices.  Is there a more likely cradle for authentic Mexican food?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the good people at Orale Orale (roughly translated \"Who's Your Daddy?\") clearly had the right idea when they set up shop across the street from the Gap at Embarcadero Center.  \n\nFirst, The Good:\n1.  It isn't Baja Fresh, Taco Bell or Chevy's.  There's no \"El Machino\" churning out tortillas while overly-peppy waiters clap Happy Birthday to some poor bastard whose work friends clearly hate him.  In fact, there are no peppy waiters at Orale.  There are savvy business men who, if the Health Department allowed them, would pre-chew your food so that it would take you less time to eat it.\n2.  You will never want for chips and salsa.  They're on the table when you sit down and they'll be refilled before the last one is gone.  This, my friends, is the essence of a good Mexican Restaurant.\n\nNow, the Less Good:\n1.  Remember what I said about non-peppy waiters?  Well, it's great when you're in a hurry, but not the best for casual diners who don't want to go back to the office.  They really don't want you to stay long, and that might be a problem if you've decided to play hooky and get tanked at lunch.\n2.  The food doesn't stand a chance on \"Top Chef,\" but -- wait, maybe this one belongs in the \"good\" section.  The food is tasty, but hardly award-winning.  Y'know? It is, however, superior - in every way - to the El Machino corporate style of any Baja Mess.\n\nOh, and did I mention it's reasonably priced?  Four stars, sir.  Four stars.", "author": "Richard T."}

I got the chicken supreme burrito, but I had so little meat that it might have well been a water and rice burrito. Maybe I should be nicer? It wasn't that bad...I'd still rather get these burritos than the ones at Palapas.  \n\nAnother unsettling factor was that the chips didn't come with the burrito (I paid $1 for chips) and the salsa is very, surprise, watery.  \n\nI would probably come back here because if I want Mexican in the FiDi, I would have no other choice.

We will hold the salsa and tostada salad in such high regard that we will build a temple for it, lavishing it with gifts and offerings. Then rival temples of the burrito and taco will arise claiming that theirs is the true divine. We will ignore these cults at first but then their followings will grow larger and larger. Families will be divided, friends will become enemies. Debates will turn to arguments which turn into fights which turns to conflicts and finally all out WAR!!! Mankind will be devastated from the fighting because with all our science we built space-guns and laser-bombs, WHY?!? WHY DID WE BUILD SPACE-GUNS AND LASER-BOMBS? From the ashes, we will rebuild and question how we fell, some will say it was human nature, some will say it was God punishing us for worshipping a false idol. Me? I say it was because THEY DIDN'T BUILD ENOUGH FUCKING TAQARIAS LIKE ORALE ORALE!!\n\nI came here for lunch and although there was a line to be seated it moved quite quickly (for those of you who have never been and just want something to go, just go straight to the register, don't worry only a few people will stare at you with hatefully eyes because they think you're cutting, but all there anger will melt away like the cheese on my tostada salad). The service was prompt, refilling the chip bowl and salsa even when it showed a slight sign of being depleted. The serving was very large, so for the financial district, it was like a Godzilla meal crushing all other meals and their homes as the other food ran away in fear. It's actually quite devastating for those meals without food house property insurance. \n\nThis combined with a the food being good with a not so monstrous price of 8 bucks boosts this place to 5 star territory. The only way this place could be better is if they offered an assortment of salsas.....and helped me conquer the Balkan Peninsula.", "author": "Youchen W."}

To think I'd been foostering with Chevy's (where I do admit to a fondness for the frozen margaritas).   So to cut to the chase, have returned several times, tried the chicken enchiladas (thus far, my M-Th favorite), the chimchangas (good, but not a favorite), the rellenos, the flautas, and the burritos, all excellent.   I still think Cancun makes the best foiled burritos, but Orale's are quite good.  I shared the chicken quesadilla with a friend and it was nice, although she did not like the onions.  Prices, especially given the financial district location, are reasonable -- each entree is under $10 and is accompanied by rice and beans, and endless baskets of tortilla  triangles and salsa.  \n\nI do believe Orale sets a high standard other Mexican establishments must meet to be included in my Yelp reviews, and so far have not found anything better in San Francisco.", "author": "Joanie F."}

Unfortunately, Orale Orale has fallen through the char-grilled cracks on many levels. Given the downtown (financial district) location, I expected this but decided to give it a shot anyhow.  The menu, which lacks a vegetarian section, only offers one option for meat-free burritos and it's the \"Vegetarian Supremo\" for $5.25. The Veg Supremo has 8 ingredients (rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, green onion, sour cream and guac). I like things simple so I ordered a burrito with rice, beans, cheese and salsa (4 ingredients), which came to $5.70. So for subtracting 4 ingredients I was charged an additional 45 cents. Add a can of diet coke and the whole thing was $7.20, which is just insane in vegetarian burrito land. Looking at the menu, I see that the for the same cost ($5.25) the Burrito Supremo offeres everything the Veg Supremo offers, only they add chicken, ground beef, port orsteak. So for budget burrito eaters like myself , this makes no sense. \n\nAnd they don't even give you chips! There was extra salsa in the bag, but no chips! The loosely folded package was sad and lumpy.

So far out here in Cali, it's alright, not great, not horrible either. So that said, I am very biased when it comes to Mexican food. Maybe I'm just partial to south Texas Mexican food. I had the cheese enchiladas and my wife had the crab enchiladas. The cheese enchiladas were the worse I have ever had. There are road side stands in SA that blow them away. The crab enchiladas were not edible. I really like crab but could not stand the taste of these. The salsa was good, actually spicy and the margaritas were worth it. I would give one star but the two stars are for the salsa, the margarita, and because my taste is biased.", "author": "Wes K."}

The meat is flavorful and has a nice crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside texture. The salsa is fresh and the rice is run of the mill. I recommend this place over Rubio's (eek) anyday.

Since transferring to the city, I've been missing the on-site cafe at my previous office that offered basic taqueria entrees on the daily lunch menu...then I was recommended to check this place out.  Granted this is the first time I've tried this place, I'm pleased that I have and even more pleased that it's just up the street from work!  I'm a little saddened to see that their fish tacos haven't gotten good reviews, as I was hoping to find another place to fill those cravings (Mijita's is good...yet too small, especially for the price).  Anyway, back to the quesadilla.  Ironically it's under their appetizers but I think the portion is perfect for an individual serving.  The tortilla was nice and crisp, the chicken was tender and guacamole and sour cream are included on the side (most places will charge extra for this!)  Waiting for my order I noticed others dining in enjoying massive burritos and tasty looking chimichangas...I will definitely have to try those next time.  There was only one person ahead of me and after placing my order, I was out of there in no time--though I did go around 1:00, after the lunch rush.  Okay, just finished my quesadilla and I'm stuffed!", "author": "Tess E."}

The owner or manager came out and said he had to order an entree.  We were put out by that and told this individual that we would order additional drinks that would be more than the cost of an entree.  The individual refused and told us we could leave if we didn't like it. One person in the table said he thought this policy was ridiculous.  So the individual opened the door and told us to leave.  He also physically threatened two of the guests as we were leaving--granted they were griping about the treatment, but still ....
