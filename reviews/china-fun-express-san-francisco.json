I love the eggplant, i love the orange chicken, or Gen'l Tsao's or whatever they have. I like the fried crispy rolls and \"dim sum\" type things. The veggies are good - not overcooked or soggy like many buffets. And I almost always get one of those sesame balls for dessert.", "author": "Richard M."}

There were various Chinese take-out like items, along with some dim sum and other bits and pieces, but the sad part is that nothing tasted all that good.\n\nThe noodles had been all broken up, the curry was too salty, the food in general was lukewarm, the whole experience overall was just disappointing.\n\nI don't think I will be back, unless I am only a little hungry and want a quick bite, but even though I'd rather walk down to Sam Wo and they are open late and have slightly better food.", "author": "Tyler T."}

I've been here a couple of times just before their closing time to find only leftovers in the trays. I'm not sure at what point they stop refilling the trays but around 8 pm you will be greeted by half empty containers. I've seen people walk-in, have a look and then walk right out seeing the sorry state of affairs, but without many options in the area, at the time, I get what looks like the freshest from the lot.\n\nIt is your standard Chinese buffet so you have your standard Chinese Chicken, Beef and Pork dishes along with fried rice, noodles and also some dim-sum options. The food is very average and nothing to write home about. Fried rice and noodles were also not bad. Beef was not overly chewy. Even the leftovers at closing time are very eatable. Keep your expectations low and you will not be disappointed.\n\nPricewise they are $6.68 per pound. A decent lunch plate would be about 2-2.5 lbs which will run you around $15 with tax. This is the cheapest option that you will find in FiDi. Lee's is $8.75/lb and Chez Falayala and the like are $11+/lb. Average food at reasonable costs (for the area) is how I'd sum up.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I don't lile to leave negative reviews but this particular experience was so bad that I feel the need to inform others. My family and I had just come back from the museum and were atarving. We typed Asian food into google maps and came across this restaraunt. It seemed convenient and appealing so we went in. The items available were extremely limited - just a few old pans of food under heat lamps in the corner. The store itself was dead - no music, no vibes, no ambience, zero attractive qualities. After picking through the pans of food (one of the workers kept forcing herself into our space to wipe and clean under us as we were getting our food despite the fact that we were being cautious and leaving no mess) for things that kinda looked good, we went to the register and found out that your plate was priced by WEIGHT. Whatever, it's the restaraunt's discretion but I really would have liked to be warned beforehand. We pay, take the plates of food, go upstairs, and proceed to attempt to choke down some of the most AWFUL restaraunt food we have ever had. Not even the two ravenous middle school boys with us could eat it. Add to that, the sound of RETCHING coming from the street under the window and the odd musty smell that permeated the restauraunt. Honestly, I hate to say this, but the meal put a real damper on an otherwise fun day. Just the thought of the stale food and nauseating smell makes me want to  retch months later. The only reason that we didn't ask for a refund was because we were that hungry.", "author": "Jamilah P."}

When it rang up (which, it was a good amount of food stuffed in the container!) It was about $6. The lady at the register offered me soup since I reached the $5 minimum--nice! I decided to be weird and mix the hot and sour with the Egg Drop (what can I say, I find HS soup too sour and ED too sweet). \n\nThat stuff really hit the spot. Pretty good price for a little bit of all the goods ;) Way better than ordering a ton of food you can't finish from any other take out place that has standard orders! compared to a place like Lee's, I'd say the variety here is better for the chinese-styled fare but I'd rather go to Lees for sandwiches or salads, or for an all around, lil' of everything option. \n\nI'd love to see more places offer a pay per pound option, it's great for those of us who just like to taste.

I don't know what prompted me to come here, but I have noticed I've been to the dungeon, I mean the International Food Court, a couple of times recently for new places that opened. Perhaps it's a bad trend I need to stop. Actually there's no perhaps about it. I need to stop feeding my curiosity about Asian fast food spots.\n\nBecause if it quacked like a duck, it probably ended up here in the warming trays in a pool of sweet-&-sour sauce.

At $5.99 per pound, it adds up if you're on a carb binge. I tried to load up on Szechuan eggplant, mapo tofu and cauliflower, but I still failed because I scooped up Shanghai noodles, pork fried rice and a few steamed dumplings (photo: http://bit.ly/1M5lnY2).

I got fried rice , chow mein, broccoli beef, tofu with black mushrooms ( the most delicious) sweet and sour chicken then shrimp dumpling and egg roll and a pot sticker. It was ok I don't know if I would go here again the egg roll and pot sticker were really dried up , sesame chicken good , beef and broccoli- ok sweet and sour chicken pretty good. I think if you go with the attitude it just so so Chinese and don't expect to get great Chinese then you're ok it's simply a convenient place when there's not much choice on a Saturday downtown !", "author": "lyn m."}

It looks slightly sketchy but hey, I was craving some Chinese food so I decided to take a gamble. I see that it is $5.88 per pound, but a pound of food doesn't really mean anything to me. I fill up my thing for dinner and it's only $4.80! So cheap! So yummy!

But I have my reasons:\n\n1.) I wanted to get a jump start on breaking my New Year's Resolution of eating more moderately and mindfully. (Ironically, my other resolution is to procrastinate less, which, beside in this case, I will fail at miserably.)\n\n2. I like visiting a place a few times before writing a review so I can get an accurate experience. THIS WAS ALL FOR YOU!\n\n3. It hits the spot for greasy food cravings that inevitably come along and it's super affordable.\n\nAs usual, my disclaimer is to take it for what it is. This is neither a gourmet, super authentic Chinese place, nor is it the most American Chinese place you'll find and there's probably MSG in the stuff, which totally doesn't make me feel good, but totally is not what I'm thinking about when I want to put their crispy hot wings in my face.  \n\nIt is however, consistent and has a wide selection of items. Grab a tray and whatever size container you want to get to it. Multiple options for starch, seafood, chicken, beef, and veggie, along with dumplings, egg rolls, and soup. My faves: The aforementioned hot wings, some crispy shrimp thing that never seems to be labeled, and the green beans. I think it's $5.88/lb. which is great because I need to feel worse about my habits and weighing them seems the way to go. \n\nSeriously though, everyone here is super nice and the line, if there's ever one, moves quickly. Better than a buffet because you only pay for what you actually choose to take.", "author": "Suganthi J."}

I think I got an MSG reaction the first time I heard of it.  \n\nWorking in the FiDi on and off for years, I must've passed this restaurant on Kearny countless times.  But I never gave it a second thought, until a couple of friends mentioned that they enjoyed going there for lunch.  So I figured, it couldn't be that bad.  Despite numerous options in the area, I tend to stick to the same familiar places.  Adding a new lunch place to my list couldn't hurt.    \n\nIt is a buffet style/steam table set-up of classic, americanized Chinese cuisine.  What I do enjoy is that they separate their vegetable entrees (which include tofu dishes), making it easier for vegetarians to gravitate to, rather than having to guess which tray is veggie amongst the other meat dishes.  They are also clearly labeled (there is a vegetable dish that has oyster sauce, i.e., not vegetarian).  \n\nPricing is based per pound. I've been here several times now, and I've managed to keep it down to under $6, yet still have a filling meal.  (And I believe if you spend more than $5, you get free soup.)  There is plenty more seating upstairs.  The trays, seats, and tables, are almost always sticky, so beware, lest you ruin your business casual attire.  \n\nI haven't gotten an adverse reaction to MSG yet, so China Fun is a-ok in my book.", "author": "Marsha Z."}

While the restaurant is pretty clean and the proprietor was good about keeping the buffet items fresh, I didn't particularly enjoy my meal.\n\nI decided to get some chow fun, braised tofu and vegetables, and some General Tso's chicken.  The chow fun tasted like it had sat there for a while- the noodles were limp and slightly mushy.  The braised tofu and vegetables were probably the best tasting item- the tofu was soft, while the zucchini and broccoli still had some crunch left to them.  The General Tso's chicken were an abomination- while they looked fresh on the steam table, they were actually more breading than chicken and the breading was chewy rather than crunchy.  \n\nOverall, China Fun Express was a good place to get a fast, if mediocre meal.  It is one of the few places open on Sundays in this part of town, so I may be back if I was really craving Chinese, but its almost easier to head over to the Westfield and get some Panda Express instead.", "author": "Angela H."}

Before you know it, the setup has you grabbing one of those cafeteria-style plastic trays, then sliding it down the  line of chaffing dishes and greedily heaping spoonful upon spoonful of oily proteins and carbohydrates into a styrofoam take-out tray.\n\nSound like fun?  IT IS!!!  But the party's over the minute you get to the cash register.  Soon thereafter, big eaters find out that a pound of Chinese food isn't quite as big as they thought it was.  For reference, the standard Glenpak 3-compartment styrofoam tray with hinged lid weighs in at around 1.82lbs when stuffed to the gills with Chow fun, fried rice, pot-stickers, and broccoli-beef.  The first shock hits when the cute girl behind the cash register beams at you with those big brown eyes, and utters your amount-due through a perfectly charming smile.  It's almost always more expensive than you you expected, but at this point the girl with the charming smile might as well be a bandit holding a loaded .38 to your head.  You can't go back and scoop food back into the trays, and you'd feel like an ass if you complained....so you wind up shelling out somewhere around ten bucks (drink included), and heading off to a table.\n\nThe second shock?  You dig into that huge assortment of not-so-cheap Chinese food, and come to the shocking realization that it's *all* incredibly bland.  On my 2-28-07 visit, the Broccoli Beef was OK, though notably long on the Broccoli and short on the beef.  The pot-stickers were borderline-acceptable, and the Chow-Fun, though not dried out, was severely lacking in taste.  Worst of all?  The fried rice was among the blandest I'd ever encountered.  My inner weight-watcher told me to ditch the tray and cut my losses....but my conscious cheapskate howled in protest at the notion of tossing out anything edible that cost me the better part of a twenty-spot.\n\nPeople had warned me that I wouldn't like this place....but I came here anyway.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-15", "description": "i love this little chinese buffet.  it's not exactly gourmet, certainly not organic, nor unique cuisine, but it hits the spot.  it's chinese comfort food  - most of it is probably not very healthy, but i trick myself into believing that the steamed ginger fish is sort of a healhy option.  it's really tasty too!  they often have steamed or sauteed green veggies like broccoli, green beens, broccoli rabe and they have a fruit bar which makes for a nice dessert.\nbest thing is, it's cheap -i can always get out of there satisfied for under $5 and that includes a complimentary cup of soup.", "author": "Mary C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-24", "description": "China Fun Express has a weird name, and a large selection of common Chinese foods like fried rice, curry chicken, chow mein, chow fun, and even some dim sum stuff. None of it is particularly good, but then again, it's cheap, fast and not particularly bad either.  They weigh your food, and charge something like $6 per pound. If you need a quick place to go for lunch, you could definitely do worse.", "author": "Eric W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-01", "description": "This is one of my financial district lunch staples.  Pay by the pound can be a blessing especially for people with small appetites like myself, so first it has that going for it.  Even if you eat more, though, the price is very fair.  The selection is great, and I think they've gotten better about refilling the bins since some of the earlier reviews here b/c they're all always full when I go.  Very tasty and fresh food, especially all the vegetarian dishes.", "author": "Carolyn B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-28", "description": "This is a buffet-style chinese place that serves an array of familiar chinese food dishes with a pretty strong vegetarian section. It's a little over $5 a pound here so you can get a substantial portion for $5-6. The food is pretty good considering the price! My only complaint is that the restaurant itself is a bit grimy and greasy. All the trays are sticky. Ew.", "author": "Kevan M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-21", "description": "OK so you really have to put this place into perspective of where it is (downtown) and what other comparable Chinese restaurants in that area offer.  Financial district is riddled with dressed up, crappy fast-food Chinese restaurants which this place is not.  They have a good/decent veggie section and have a wide variety of meat dishes.  What it's not is eloquent and to say fun is a stretch, but if you are like me and work downtown, care about what you put into your system and like to pay no more that $8 for lunch then this place is worth it.", "author": "G L."}

Well they looked at me like I had 3 heads yet made me soup.  Not so much.  It was okay, I was full after 2 won tons, but it had broccoli and all this funky barbecued pork and beef in it.  Sounds good right.  Wrong.  And tons of MSG.  This is a place you can skip.", "author": "Nicole F."}

I've had just about everything there and its all better than the average Chinese buffet.  The biggest complaint is the slow people in line who don't know what they want to eat.  Move over!  The best thing is that day after day the food taste the same. There is an upstairs that is hardly used but its a little to warm for my taste. I do pass by a few other Chinese places to get to this one because, I love that I can just get in and out within 3-4 minutes with some pretty good food.  It is what it is: A pay by the pound Chinese buffet.", "author": "Angela Y."}

I get my fix of Chinese food at this place once a week or so. Never have I seen dried up and cold food trays. A lot of meat and vege selections. love love love their spicy chicken wings....slightly crispy dipped in chilli sauce/paste and vinegar and what not..yum yum..tastes much more delish than it sounds. Make sure you have a pitcher of water around :-)", "author": "MrsNIFTY G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-05-05", "description": "Self-service chinese buffet by the pound. Fairly priced and fairly cooked. A rather large non-vege section and a six item vegetarian section, though I've often gone only to find four of the six vege trays have run out and not been refilled - super frustrating!
