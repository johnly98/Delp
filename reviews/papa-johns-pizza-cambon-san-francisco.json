Been here many times, due to the place being close to SFSU, and their tuesdays, buy 1 pizza, get another one free, for any size deal. Lots of pizza variety, and their garlic parmesan breadsticks, garlic knots, cheesesticks, its it ice cream (vanilla, cappuccino, and mint flavors), and cinnamon pull ups are all good. Their wings are also good too, but they're a bit more expensive. They have many different sauces they can provide you, such as buffalo, nacho cheese, pizza sauce, honey mustard, etc. My top favorite pizza still is the buffalo chicken. For a pizza chain, the buffalo sauce is good, the chicken is tender, bacon is good, overall, its pretty tasty! (you cant beat the buy one get one free deal)", "author": "Kyle H."}

I normally order from this place when I get my free 1 topping medium pizza from T-Mobile. Online order and then I go pick it up. No waits, always ready when I get there. All I can say is, portion size is terrible. One would assume that they fill up the pizza. NOPE. You get like a sprinkle of toppings. It's like the bare minimum. (Though I can't complain when it's free I guess but still imagine if I were to pay...) The medium has about 8 slices. I liked the garlic butter that each pizza comes with.

We ordered for delivery from this Papa John's Pizza for our winter party. The kids' review begins here:\n\n     We think that Papa John's pizza is so delicious and awesome! One reason is that there were breadsticks and they were chewy. We also ate pepperoni pizza, cheese pizza, and a John's Favorite pizza. Our favorite part was the pizza of course, but everyone also liked the breadsticks, too! One reason the pizza was good is because we like cheese, pepperoni, and sausage, and there were a lot of those ingredients on our pizzas. Some kids disagreed on how much sauce was on the pizza. Another reason the pizza was good is that it was hot when it got to our classroom, and it looked perfect! We also gave it four stars because they made it in time for lunch! The driver was right on time. This is important because it gave us more time for recess. \n     Here are some quotes from our class: \nStudent L: \"I thought the pizza was okay because I thought there was too much cheese and too much pepperoni but I liked the breadsticks.\" \nStudent G: \"The food was radical!\"\nStudent J: \"The food was delicious!\"\nStudent P: \"The pizza was so delicious I want to make my own pizza store and eat more.\" \nStudent S: \"The food was so good, I really want to eat some more.\" \nStudent T: \"The pizza was so delicious I want to go into this screen so I can eat more.\" \nStudent K: \"I like your pizza!\" \n     Overall, most kids in class loved the pizza, but some of us thought there were better pizzas out there. It is on the top five pizza list for most kids in our class. Thank you for the pizza!", "author": "Natalie K."}

I put the order in when I left work, as per usual, but because of the rain and an accident on the freeway, I showed up 20 minutes after the estimated pickup time. \n\nNot only was the staff rude about me being late, but one of my XLs was only a large.

There's a roundabout (I hate roundabouts) that you drive around and around waiting to find the exit out to feed you to the mouth of the strip mall but I kept missing it. Maybe I should blame that on myself but it ruined my experience.\n\nAll in all a good pizza, just a little far for me.", "author": "Julia P."}

Sometimes, I lie down and pour tomato sauce all over my body and cover myself with shredded cheese and pretend to be a pizza. THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE PIZZA!\n\nWeirdness aside, I've been to all the \"gourmet\" pizza places in San Francisco (Little Star, Patxi's, Tony's, Pizzeria Delfina, etc.) and continue to come to this simple conclusion: Papa John's has the best pizza in California. I know everyone buckets Papa John's into a quick service restaurant like Pizza Hut and Dominoes, but in reality, Papa John's is a premium brand with much better pizza. In fact, in 1998, Pizza Hut sued Papa John's claiming Papa John's was falsely advertising with its slogan: \"Better ingredients. Better pizza. Papa John's.\" This case made it all the way to the Supreme Court before the Supreme Court realized this case was the stupidest case of all time and clearly Papa John's had better ingredients and better pizza. The appeals court ruled that Papa John's slogan was about personal taste and concluded the cheese from other pizza places was made out of the sour milk from the hairy utters of an ugly anorexic cow. \n\nPapa John's never freezes any of its ingredients, which is why the pizza tastes so much better than any pizza I've ever had. I view Papa John's as the In-N-Out of pizza. The ingredients are fresher, the food tastes better, and the service is fantastic. Papa John's is a huge company with thousands of locations worldwide so it is able to buy all of its premium ingredients in bulk at a cheaper price than all the expensive and high-end pizza places in San Francisco. Not only are you getting better quality ingredients at Papa John's, but you are also getting it at a much cheaper price. Lastly, I'm excited for the opening of the new Papa John's in the heart of San Francisco that will finally deliver to me; this Cambon location is quite far from the heart of SF.", "author": "Heisenberg W."}

Knowing my expectations I have ordered several pizzas from them online with Groupons or coupons they send in the mail.  There is a 10% discount if you order online too.\n\nI've never had any problems with their customer service.  They have always been polite, fast and helpful on the phone and I have always got my pizza in less than the quoted time (granted I have almost always taken it to go).\n\nThe one time I had it delivered it took much longer than the quoted time.  Called the store and they said it had already been delivered right as I saw the delivery guy veer around the corner.  He looked new and anxious so I quickly forgave the late effort.  I always pick up now and the pie takes less than 10-15 mins every time.\n\nI like how they can be a bit sloppy with their toppings and how everything sort of falls off the slice as I eat it (my fault, I always order extra sauce!).

Could have been both, I forgot) He would talk for years about wishing there was a Papa John's in the City. I don't know what Pagan god he was worshiping to get it, but it came to him, and it was super close.\n\nIt's not like I didn't believe him about the awesomeness of Papa John's, but this was the same person who said SoCal burritos are better than the burritos made in San Francisco. And he said dogs can't look up... no wait, that was from Shaun of the Dead... my bad.\n\nWe ordered online, and I was amazed that a pizza joint had a very competent online order system that wasn't Pizza Hut (meh.) The delivery guy was on time and cool, and the pizza was great. It wasn't as great as Escape from New York's You Say Potato pizza, and I have to have a taste test with this and Senore's... but for its price, this pizza was really, REALLY good. The garlic Parmesan breadsticks are freakin' awesome, but I think it's glazed with some type of human catnip or liquid crack. And sure, their cheesesticks are basically a cheese pizza cut in rectangular slices, but it's still good.\n\nI've read the other reviews, but honestly for me, I've never had a problem with them. The pizza was usually good to great, and they always have a good deal going on. Plus, it felt like seven times out of ten, I'd get a free box of It's Its, which makes it even more awesome.\n\nSince I've moved, I've only ordered once from them, and when I ordered online, it wouldn't allow me to pick \"delivery,\" and when I thought I fixed it, it still said \"pick up.\" I called them up and they said my location was literally on the border of their delivery limit, that the other side of my street was their cut off, but they made an exception and fixed the problem with no complaints. \n\nI'm giving them a very high 4 stars. They're not perfect, and I've had better pizza, but I definitely prefer them over any other national chain like Pizza Hut and Domino's (Round Table is second.)

I'm never expecting amazing authentic fabulous delicious pizza, especially not from a chain delivery place right next to a college. What I do expect is my order, delivered on time, correct toppings and freshness.  \n\nWhat I have consistently gotten from this location is the wrong toppings, forgotten items, and a lack of concern about that. Also, why does it take 45 minutes for you to deliver my pizza when I live 5 blocks away? That's right, I live inside Park Merced. 45 minutes? Did he walk, the long way round? \n\nThe employees never know what the specials are (or don't feel like sharing the info) and consistently tell me that they cannot honor sales or deals from the NATIONAL website because \"we are special, we offer free ice cream here instead of those deals, nobody else does that\". Okay. Who the eff wants It's It with pizza? Who thought up that brilliant scheme?? Ice cream sandwiches and pizza aren't exactly peas and carrots my friends. Also, if you don't want to honor national deals from your corporate website, maybe you shouldn't have purchased a franchise...?\n\nThe fifth time they screwed up my order I emailed the corporate office. I didn't hear back from them for a few weeks so I sent another email asking if their customer service office is a black hole in the abyss, and was called back by the store manager a few days later. He said he had called repeatedly and left messages (sure, ok, I guess my digital voicemail is on the fritz again??) and has a free pizza waiting for me at the store when I want it.

I love you man!!\", followed by a manly fist-bump (no hugging or other such displays of affection for us insecure str8 guys) was his reaction.\n\nNow, I know pizza places can get busy on SB Sunday. But I'm thinking: this is Papa John's. They're a chain. They know the drill by now. Still, to give them enough of a lead time, I ordered the pizza online around noon, for pickup at 2:45. I'm thinking: pick it up at 2:45, zip back on Portola, stick it into the oven and zippidy-doo-dah, I'm all set. Game starts at 3.\n\nI show up at 2:45 after bumbling around in the maze down by SFSU, and there's a long line. Secretly congratulating myself over my awesome move to order online, I find myself pitying the folks standing in line. \n\nWith a straight face I casually tell the dweebs in line: \"I just have to pick up my pizza.

How is this possible?\n\nAs I stood there, torn between getting to the game, and keeping the promise to my buddy, I watched the sorry state of affairs in this pizza place. They had no clue about what they were doing. The girl at the checkout counter was completely overwhelmed. Every few minutes she'd say \"your pizza will be ready in just a minute\", followed by more bumbling around. I heard irate customers (who had ordered delivery, apparently) call to complain and be put on hold; followed by the eventual disconnection. A lady walked in and was told that pizza would take an hour; but chicken fingers would be done right away. So she ordered the chicken fingers. And waited 45 minutes for them too anyways. \n\nEventually, I got my pizza at 3:45, and missed the entire first quarter (which wasn't that great, from what I heard). \n\nThe pizza was just plain average. The wait and lack of preparedness just did it for me; never again I'm going back.\n\nOh, and they did give me a free box of \"It's It\" Icecream, for the trouble.", "author": "A J."}

Although their pizzas are good and try to be gourmet, they fall short in a few areas: quality of the pepperoni and sausages is questionable and can't compete with pizzerias; tomato sauces that can be too sweet and uninspiring (unoriginal, bland, flat) in flavor; cheeses that don't melt; and the pizza needs to stay in the oven longer to allow the dough to bake thoroughly. Also, there's a reason why toppings are called....\"toppings\". I do not understand why they bury most of ingredients under the cheese.\n\n1.  Hawaiian BBQ Chicken (5/5) -- The tangy sweet barbecue sauce worked great with all of the toppings, from the wholesome white chicken pieces, crumbles of bacon, mild but sweet red onions to the juicy pineapples. And the pizza wasn't too greasy or oily too!\n\n2.  Spicy Italian (5/5) -- This pizza could use more heat! They delivered the spicy Italian kick by way of generous portions of small spicy Italian sausages but they should have thrown in spicy pepperoni as well! Overall, a more interesting choice than a meat lover's typical salty all-meats-topping pizza.\n\n3.  The Meats (4.5/5) -- Saltiness is the name of the game! What do you expect when pepperoni, (regular, non-spicy) sausage, beef, hickory smoked bacon and Canadian bacon are loaded on the pizza? Honestly, though, all the meats tasted the same when buried underneath the mozzarella cheese, and I can't remember if tasted any beef.\n\n4.  The Works (4/5) -- It's topped with the usual pepperoni, Italian sausage, green bell peppers, red onions, mushrooms and olives; the only oddball it also includes is the Canadian bacon.\n\n5.  Garlic Chicken (3/5) -- Because the tangy sourness of the the garlic ranch sauce overwhelmed the toppings, this pizza did not rate well for me, even more so that it lacked strong garlic flavor. The white chicken meat was not grilled. I appreciate they used whole garlic cloves but not all pieces were well roasted. The artichokes, buried under cheese and needed to be roasted, were saltier than the the ranch sauce.", "author": "Cliff W."}

We ordered 5 large, thin- crust specialty pizzas.\n  \nDelivery- they said it would take 35 min.  Pizzas came after an hour- luke warm.  I asked the delivery guy about the garlic dipping sauce I heard about that came with the pizzas. Delivery guy said the sauces are in each box.  Mind you, there were 5 large pizzas.  When I opened them, there were none. I called papa john's and told them about it. The staff said it didn't come with it. Hmmmm. So what is it? \n\nPizza- VERY SKIMPY on the ingredients. Not worth it.  \n\nFirst time and last time. I don't recommend them.", "author": "M D."}

They give you a choice of thick or thin crust, light or extra sauce, regular or light cheese...and they have lots of 2 pizza specials.  My bf and I are big eaters and we usually order our own pizzas.  He always gets the thin crust which is always very crispy almost like a cracker..but he gets extra sauce which balances it out. I always get jalapenos on my pizza they are always crunchy and spicy but not too hot. The are a few things I do not like about this place is they charge you a delivery fee, maybe it's to make up for people who don't tip well....and they ALWAYS skimp on the mushrooms!! For the most part though they make good pizza and the delivery man is always very personable and friendly...he even greets our dogs nicely.", "author": "Charla M."}

You must place your order on-line to use the Groupon. Website is easy to use. Placed my order and received an email right away stating my order will be ready in 15-20 minutes. This was my first visit to Papa John's. Plenty of parking. My order was ready when I arrived. The staff is awesome and they rock! This location is located right by SFSU...so the place is always busy with college students.  We ordered an X-Large pizza with one half sausage, mushroom, black olives and fresh tomatoes and the other half ham and pineapple (our usual pizza order for any pizza joint). It was yummy. There's something different about the dough that makes it oh soo good compared to other places. We also ordered cheese sticks. It was insanely good. If I wasn't watching my calorie intake to fit in my wedding dress I would have eaten the whole thing. I'm soo glad that there was a Groupon for this joint because if it didn't I wouldn't have known about this place. Papa John's is definitely going on our list of pizza joints! \n\nMMMM...Cheese sticks!!! *drool*", "author": "Jo S."}

I always order my pizzas online and they post all their current deals on their website plus they give you 10% off. You can't get better than that. You get what you pay for and Papa John's definitely have better pizza than other chains like Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Round Table. I recommend everyone to order their pizzas online to take advantage of the current deals they got online. I just ordered a large with 5 toppings online for $10.79 ($11.99 + 10% discount). Just finished eating half the pizza by myself because it tastes that delicious. \n\nDon't call Papa John's and expect them to tell each and every customer about their current deals.

I ordered 2 Large Pizzas for delivery on a Sunday for an NFL Football playoff get together. Our pizza arrived fast and piping hot. Unfortunatily that's the only compliment we can give. When we dug in expecting a great pizza, all the toppings fell to the ground. Ok so the pizza might have been a little soft but when we looked closer, the dough was still raw. We tried to eat it but it but the raw dough was just too disgusting. From what we ate, the toppings and sauce tasted decent but the dough just ruined it. Anyhow, we couldn't finish the pizza and ended up throwing it away. What a waste. We ended up ordering 2 more pizza's from another place. Bummer.......I understand they are a new location but I hopw they work on the quality.", "author": "Eddie N."}

I ordered in the store and for some reason it took a while for them to enter in my card. Once the transaction was finally done he said it would take 10 minutes, so I decided to sit and wait inside. I ended up waiting for 30 minutes for a personal pepperoni pizza! During my time waiting I noticed that the workers don't change their gloves when they switch from making pizza to taking orders at the register. Gross. I even saw someone order after me, and they got their order done before mine! So after 30 minutes I asked how much longer it would take for my order and they told me they messed up and would have to start all over again. But then they ended up finding my order, laying on a counter in the back. You'd think after exchanging looks with the workers so many times they'd think to just hand me my order since I was only sitting 5 feet away from them. My pizza wasn't even hot anymore by the time I ate it. I am never going here again.", "author": "Jayzel Ann R."}

Not only was this completely inappropriate and no way to treat a customer, but I was completely appalled by the way he handled the situation. Yes, I was taking a nap and did not hear the delivery guy smashing away at my door knob. Personally, I would have CALMLY called the customer and CALMLY notified them that they were at the door. Instead, this guy used a very hostile and unprofessional tone of voice asking whether I was home or not and demanded an explanation as to why I was not answering my door. I was extremely shaken up and was rudely awaken from my slumber. I regrettably tipped the guy for the \"inconvenience\" I bestowed upon him. Hands down, the worst customer service experience ever. I also asked for two garlic sauces and they ended up giving me one garlic and one pizza sauce .....", "author": "Erica A."}
