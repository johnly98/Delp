Great bento bozes with lots of variety. From a variety of mains like grilled salmon and saba to takoyaki to deep-fried horse mackerel (ajipura) accompanied by a plethora of sides like fried tofu, calamari, tamago, pot stickers, salad and more. They switch it up quite frequently which is nice. Fret not if you're not on Mealpal, grab-and-go bento boxes are $10 for lunch and you have quite a few choices for the entree. \n\nHaven't actually eaten in but the space looks nice and the folks that work here are very friendly. Still, I thoroughly enjoy Zen Izakaya as a speedy and delicious take-out lunch option.", "author": "Jon L."}

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the salmon. The uni was another pleasant surprise - no weird/fishy taste here! They harvest (is harvest the right word?) their ikura themselves from salmon that they get in - kewl!\n\nOverall, solid spot, just be sure to count what you're served lol.

In addition to the perfectly cooked piece of salmon, there was a piece of fried tofu, pickled veggies, one gyoza, a few pieces of fried calamari, two octopus balls, a small salad w/ tomato, and seasoned rice. \n\nI would definitely recommend getting this as a meal and also plan to dine in for some more extensive options.

Wagyu beef typically only has some seasoning; salt and pepper. But this dish had a garlic sauce on top of it (probably to cover up that it wasn't actually wagyu beef).

Was weirded out by the location at first, thought I was in the wrong place. Upon entering, it was actually cool. \n\nLots of wine and sake, I just got a Yuzu Shochu for myself, which was great! Waiter recommended one of the Ginjos, I think, so shared that with my girlfriend. \n\nFoodwise, we got the Papaya Splash, Lovely Night Roll and the Wasabi Salmon. The papaya Splash wasn't my favorite, too fruity and tangy, but my girlfriend loved it for exactly those reasons. I liked the presentation though. The Lovely Night Roll was good, but completely outshined by the Wasabi Salmon. My girlfriend hates wasabi, so I got it all to myself. If you enjoy real wasabi, not the fake stuff they give in many restaurants, then this is the dish for you. The wasabi was the perfect amount to not overpower the salmon. The flavor was enhanced with soy sauce, but it's one of those dishes that doesn't need it. The fish overall had great texture- you could tell it was fresh. \n\nFor dessert we got red bean taiyaki. It was presented with blueberries and whipped cream. Weird.. but it actually paired really well with the red bean! Would get that again. And will now buy blueberries when I get red bean desserts at the market lol\n\nOverall, a great place for a date.

We ordered a handful of their newer items by recommendation of the staff.\n\nFirst two things to come out were the Asparagus Gomaae & Garlic Edamame. The latter definitely being something of interest due to garlic flavor being enhanced by the butter.\n\nWhat followed was the Pepper Tail & Wasabi Salmon. Both were just absolutely amazing, with the pepper tail being complimented by lemon juice & jalapeno and the wasabi salmon being accompanied by fresh wasabi (not the paste that you normally expect from lower-end japanese establishments). Definitely recommend getting either of these two if you're into raw fish at all.\n\nThe third set of items were the Tonkatsu & Duck Breast Roasted. Though I had personal reservations with the tonkatsu, it was overall pretty good. The pork itself was really nice and tender, the breading wasn't too heavy, and the demiglas sauce is where this dish is taking in a different direction. Instead of the tangy, heavy sauces that we're used to from other locations, the demiglas is lightly sweet and very easy on the stomach. It is best followed by sushi, as I've been informed by the staff. The duck breast was absolutely wonderful, paired with garlic chips made for a great deep flavor profile. My friends definitely enjoyed adding some of the demiglas sauce onto the duck, which made it even better in my opinion.\n\nAs extras, I ordered Toro Nigiri & Corn Cheese. The toro I requested lightly seared (imo brings it to way higher level due to some oils coming out in the searing process) and the corn cheese could honestly have been a bit sweeter (totally personal preference) but was still awesome to have.\n\nThe staff were very attentive and we were treated very well during our time there.

For one person, I'd say expect to spend something like $25-$35 here before drinks for a normal meal. For example, a unagi donburi (BBQ eel bowl) is usually $12-$15 at your typical family-owned sushi restaurant but $20-$25 here depending on if you get the mini or the large. \n\nBut once in a while it's worth it to pay up, because this place is not your normal sushi restaurant. I might go as far as to say what they do is akin to sushi art; they do try to experiment with different flavors to delectably innovative results. Nothing is too in-your-face per se, but the differences are delicate enough to be familiar yet *better*. I'd definitely come here again, but only on special occasions.\n\nIf you're looking for recommendations, I'd try the rolls (I like the Rock 'N Roll) and the chef's creations.

Wagyu beef on sizzling stone: the fat is evenly distributed and is of good ratio versus lean meat. The result is super tender meat that's just perfection alone, without the sauces. \n2. Tako yaki: delicious and authentic  \n3. Scallop appetizer: served on sliced avocado, fish roe, and special aioli sauce. This was my favorite dish, simply perfection. \n4.

It took 5 minutes after sitting down for anyone to acknowledge us and bringing water. \n2. After we placed our order, it took 50 minutes for the food to arrive. No one came checking on us during this time. \n3. When food finally came, the server realized how unhappy we were and offered to give us a free appetizer and half off one entree.

This japanese restaurant recently opened up in my neighborhood so my bf and I checked it out on a last minute whim. We didn't have to make reservations ahead of time, although they do take it, which is nice. The reason why I give 3 stars here is because of waitress we had. \n\nmost japanese restaurants do not use dairy, but this place is more of an asian fusion japanese restaurant. I was extra careful when ordering.\n\nI recently developed a very serious allergy to dairy which I've gone to doctors multiple times and avoiding it to a T. I'm not on some \"healthy\" diet here. I asked the waitress multiple times and emphasized that I have a FOOD ALLERGY. and she told me \"oh everything on the menu is pretty self-explanatory. it's very straight forward if it contains dairy it would state it as such.) She repeated the same statement multiple times when I wanted to double check which items had dairy and which didn't.\n\nSo my bf and i decided to share a couple items. Everytime she came back, I'd confirm with her about the dairy situation. I think at this point she was somewhat annoyed at me since it was so \"self explanatory.\" We got a few items to share: a roll, the hamachi kama, and chicken breast. \n\nWhen the chicken breast came, I was about to take a bite until I noticed the crust looked oddly like cheese. On the menu, the chicken breast stated \"panko crust\" and no where on the menu did it state \"WITH CHEESE.\" I was furious at this point! Not so STRAIGHTFORWARD at all is it?!? \n\nWhen I called her over to talk about the situation. She was extremely defensive about how the menu changes and she had no idea we would share. \n\nlet's take a moment here and talk about kitchen laws. If someone states a food allergy, the restaurant is required to pass a note to the kitchen and keep certain food at a distance during preparation. Not only was the cheese not kept at a distance, it was cooked into our food! If I had a peanut allergy or if I had a air-restricting allergy and I didn't notice the cheese, I could have died. \n\nShe went to her manager who came by and gave us a reasonable apology. \n\nI wanted to give this restaurant 1 star, but I thought the manager was very professional about the situation and comped our meal.

I had the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, which was really cool because I got to see the chefs prepare all the food right in front of my eyes. \n\nThe main chef in the restaurant is this super nice dude who puts so much heart and attention into all of his dishes. I watched him create the sashimi special, a monster ice plated dish with an art exhibition made out of seafood on top, and every step of the way, he made sure everything had to go exactly where it was supposed to. If he thought something was missing, he'd redo the entire part again, and the presentation was just breathtaking. The dish seemed to be a bustling city of activity (ironically though, since all the seafood on it was dead).\n\nI didn't have the luxury of ordering such a magnificent dish, since I was alone, so I settled for one of their sushi rolls. I ordered the OMG Roll, which is great for those who love fish, and really enjoyed it. It was presented in a pyramid fashion, which is different from what you'd normally expect, but the toppings, the sauce, and how everything was wrapped together was awesome. Also, a surprise for me was the wasabi. Their wasabi is not too strong, and had enough flavor that enhanced my sushi eating experience. \n\nOverall, the service was actually pretty slow here...they didn't start making my roll until 30 minutes in, but at least the food was excellent and the chef was an awesome guy.

Had a lunch combo that came with 3x3 basic rolls, a salad, and a miso soup (California, spicy tuna, and shrimp tempura). It was some of the blandest most uninteresting sushi I've ever had, even as these most basic rolls go. Maybe their fancier rolls are better, I can't say. \n       The main reason for the 2 star is for an incredibly awkward experience where the server who spoke very poor English placed a 2 piece sashimi in front of me. I thought it was complimentary because I declined the salad that came with my combo. I figured it was a substitution or something. Maybe a minute goes by, she snatches the sashimi back without saying anything, and promptly gives it to the guy sitting two seats next to me at the bar. We just sort of awkwardly stared at each other. I'm sorry, but are you fucking kidding me? You don't put food in front of a customer, and then take it back with no explanation. You definitely don't give said food to another customer. Major health code concern there. Will never be returning.", "author": "Yanni D."}

Here is what I ordered..\n\nTonkatsu ($20) - the tonkatsu was dry, not juicy \nBlue Fin Toro Tartare ($25) - this was good but a very small amount of tartare with avocado on the bottom, it also only came with 4 chips. I asked for more chips though\nUdon Carbonara  ($17) - this was extremely overpriced, as it was just udon with cream sauce and veggies, no meat whatsoever. This looked like it should cost $12\nAnkimo ($21.50) - this was extremely overpriced. This only came with 4 pieces of ankimo and it was dry without the ponzu sauce. I had to request it from the waiter. I think ankimo is usually $10-12 at other Japanese places\nSeared Yaki Roll ($19.50) - this roll was yummy! But once again $20 for a roll is kind of overpriced for a $$ sign place. I think $15-17 max is more expected\n\nOverall, I've had much better Japanese food for a better price elsewhere (like Zushi Puzzle, sooo good)", "author": "Sophia L."}

The servings are incredibly small so don't come hungry, and while I understand that small portions are characteristic of fine dining, this was not fine dining. I expected traditional, simple sushi but Zen Izakaya seems to serve more Asian fusion-inspired dishes. \n\nThe plating was truthfully very picturesque but the flavors were underwhelming. The papaya-crab salad California roll was no better than a roll at a standard sushi joint. In addition, the service was slow and the waiting times long.

Being at an izakaya, I was expecting juicy, marinated dark meat with crisp fried breading.  What I got instead was white meat, brined at best, with some uninspiring breading (I was getting chicken tenders vibes). I was the most excited for the fried chicken so this was definitely the biggest let down for me. I'd give the kara-age alone 1.5 stars. \n\nOther than that, I ordered the beef tendon nikomi, along with some sake toro (salmon belly) and unagi (eel) sushi. The beef tendon dish was fine, and my sushi was good (though their sushi rice was also lackluster). \n\nI might come back to try the hirame (flounder) sushi, since they were out and I haven't found many other places that serve it, and potentially some entrees, but my expectations have been set for any future visits.", "author": "Billy Y."}

Not the best I've had but definitely one of the better ones I've had and worth the money.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-26", "description": "This place's name is misleading, in my opinion, as it does not really remind me of an izakaya. Still, if you are looking to try a Japanese restaurant, this one could be a good try.\n\nThe table service was okay and the service upon entrance definitely needs improving. Near the entrance, there was a reception desk on which there was a sign saying 'please wait to be seated.' No one was sitting behind the reception desk and so I just followed the sign's instruction, sat on a chair near the reception desk, and waited for someone from the restaurant to take me to a table. However, for 10 minutes, no one came to me. I thought the place could be busy so I just patiently sat there. When someone finally came and realized that I was waiting for a table, he said he thought I was waiting for my take-out order. While I am sure that the mistake was unintentional, the restaurant could have been done much better. With the 'please wait to be seated' sign there, how was I supposed to know that I should immediately go into the dining area, called a staff and asked to be seated?\n\nThe food was decent. The nigiri rice was tight enough so that the rice didn't fall apart when picked up, which was a plus. However, the rice was also too tight such that the rice tasted 'lumpy'. Still, overall the sushi was okay. Additionally, for rolls, I wish the chefs didn't put avocado in every roll...\n\nI went to this place during the lunch time and thus the experience was somewhat incomplete, since the dinner menu is much larger than its lunch menu. Hopefully, next time the experience would be better from the beginning.", "author": "Sydney C."}

Came here for dinner we started to order two things for appetizers, both of which they had run out of, along with a couple other appetizers and rolls. Fine, we chose other appetizers - gyoza and chicken nuggets, which were both good. My husband and I then ordered 3 rolls and 2 orders of salmon nigiri to share. It was delicious but way too much food. We can usually have a couple rolls each at least, but these rolls are very heavy. Zen doesn't have a lot of the basic rolls that you usually see, such as salmon avocado, spicy crunchy shrimp, California roll, etc. Their rolls are very unique but each roll has a ton of ingredients, which ends up making it heavy. I would come back again, but I recommend starting with one roll at a time, especially since each roll is $17-$20.", "author": "Gauri B."}

I was incredibly disappointed with the quality of food as well as the pricing for such low quality food. Nothing I ate was in the slightest authentic-tasting. I recommend these chefs spend a little more time visiting and learning how Izakaya style restaurants prepare food in Japan. The karage/ fried chicken was nothing like what you'd find in Japan.

Again, the risk didn't pay off.\n\nWe also ordered a seaweed salad, which was a tiny portion. Again, I think they tried to make the presentation look special and served the appetizer in what looked like a small cocktail glass. As a result, the portion was a miss, and the two of us barely had a mouthful each.\n\nAs for their regular nigiri, nothing special here. The fish wasn't great. Had a saba, which they they torched and ruin the flavour of the fish. The salmon sushi was the only decent thing. Portion was average, but way too much rice, and each order was about $7-8.", "author": "Raph T."}

The pork belly salad came with a generous serving of meat which was not oily at all.  The scallops served over seared avocado and topped with caviar were amazing-probably my favorite of all the dishes.  I loved cooking the Wagyu at the table over a hot stone.  Lastly, the cheesecake ice cream was yummy too.  Cannot find these dishes at another restaurant and they were ALL delicious.  Will definitely return soon!", "author": "Jenny K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-16", "description": "I feel conflicted. The food here was actually decent, but way over priced. The restaurant seemed like it wanted to be upscale, with smaller portions sizes and higher prices, but the environment was severely lacking, with its paper menus and sticky tables.\n\nThe wagyu sizzling stone cooked beef dish was tasty, but the sizzling stone gimmick was rather annoying, as the stone would cool down very quickly and we would have to wait for the waiter to come bring us a new one. \n\nWe saw advertisement for $10 lunch bento boxes, which sound like they might fit the restaurant style better. The dinner however, cost us about $40 per person, and we left unsatisfied.", "author": "Hope Y."}

If you have options though, go somewhere else.  \n\nThe service is okay.  There was someone there to take our order, get us the check, but no check in's. I am not high maintenance, so that's enough services for me.  \nThe menu is huge and confusing. They cover rolls, sashimi, entrees, a bunch of random apps.  Nothing about this place is what you'd exactly think of as Izakaya.  I am skeptical of places with huge menus. It's a small kitchen and you can't do everything well. The menu screams of a restaurant that's trying too hard.\n\nThe food was average at best.  We got the Wasabi Salmon, fried crawfish, age dashi tofu, beef tendon (just to be a little adventurous) and some sake. Salmon and sake were good, the rest were in the C+ range.  \n \nThis place is also surprisingly expensive. It really is on the low end of the $$$ range. This was not a lot of food and cost a bit over $80.", "author": "John S."}
