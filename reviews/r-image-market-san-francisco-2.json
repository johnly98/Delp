I think it comes down to a combination of factors:  the bread is always super fresh and softer than at most delis, they use quality ingredients (boar's head meats, homemade hummus and falafel, etc.), and Ray's Mix.  Ray's Mix is a mixture of different herbs and spices, along with a little bit of finely-chopped red onion and pickled jalape\u00f1o.  Not enough to be spicy, but enough to add some great flavor.  There's nothing bland here.  They also have an exhaustive selection of beverages, including some that are difficult to find elsewhere in SF.  Overall, highly recommended.  I only wish I had discovered this place sooner.\n\nMy tip:  try the sesame roll on whatever sandwich you're getting.

If you live nearby, you need to be shopping here.\n\nThe details:\n\nReasonably priced and really good wine. (Try the CarMenAir or the Gascon Malbec!)\n\nA large selection of microbrewery beers.\n\nHealthy/organic grocery staples at the same prices you'd see at a larger store, or less. (Brands like Amy's, Lundberg, Bob's Mill, Mary's crackers, etc.)  This is the kind of place that had Seitan in the freezer, ten kinds of organic soy/rice/coconut milk, organic butter and cheese, quinoa, Adel's sausages, kale chips, etc.  You could probably do about half your grocery shopping here without missing out.\n\nThe bagels are delivered fresh from The Bagelry a few times a week. \n\nThe Felafel wraps here are some of the best in the city.  The house made hummus and babaganoush in the deli case is possibly the best I've ever tasted.  \n\nThe breakfast bagel sandwiches are such a good deal and so delicious.  They are made to order and you can get an egg and cheese bagel or lox and cream cheese. The best thing is to get a cup of coffee at phills and then come to Ray's for a bagel sandwich, and eat it outside at the little table.\n\nYou might think from this description that this is an upscale gourmet market for yuppies.  But actually the vibe is totally down to earth and lots of people shop here from all walks of life.  They accept EBT.  There are a range of prices and products with lots of really inexpensive staple foods available.  \n\nRay is such a nice and funny guy, always joking and making everyone feel welcome.  The rest of the staff is awesome too.  It is very stable, with the same employes there for the long haul.  \n\nAs far as I can tell, everyone who works there speak both Spanish and English fluently, and I see many local Spanish speaking people from the neighborhood shopping here.  Several of the staff speak Arabic too, and there are some nice Middle Eastern/Mediterranean specialty foods on the shelves as well. Just when I think I've browsed everything they have, I find some new little treasure.  Justin's nut butters.  Dad's cardamom flavor ice cream.  Blue Bottle Gelatto Popsicles. Just Desserts Carrot Cake.  House made rice pudding. I could go on and on, but really you should just go see for yourself.\n\nThis really is the place!", "author": "katie s."}

I love Ray's!\n\nThis store epitomizes my conceptualization of the local corner store:\n- family run (Ray and family)\n- fresh made, large portion sandwiches for the budget inclined\n- craft beer, more than basic wine selection, & tons of different juices, sodas, etc.\n- some fresh fruits/veggies and deli cooler w/ olives, potato salad and such\n- legit chip selection\n- great hours (open early and late)\n\nMy go-to sandwiches are Chicken Basil, Chicken Pesto and the Pastrami. Can't go wrong with the Falafel (super-sized and tasty) either. \n\nRay seems to know about everybody that comes in his store.

I had a coupon from kgbdeals for this place (deli item voucher for $6), and, based on the great reviews, decided to try them out. So I show up on Thursday (May 12) at 9:10pm - the guy is super friendly, says 'Oh yes, we take these coupons, no problem, but the deli is closed, you need to come back another day before 9'. Fine, I am in the neighborhood again on Sunday (May 15) and stop by at 5pm. There are three people behind the counter, and the moment I offer my coupon, they start whispering among each other. The one who says he is the manager says that they would accept it at first, but then changes his mind and asks me to 'come back later when the owner is here'. I tell them that I was already there a few days ago and they get very confrontational and start challenging me and tell me that I am lying. I insist they call the owner, which they do after a lot of argument. This is the side of the conversation I hear - the 'manager': 'Hey, do we take those kgbdeals coupons?'; 'We do?'; 'What, so I will just hand out free sandwiches now, is that it?' Then he hangs up and says, 'Sorry, we can't take your coupon'. That's it, end of story. I ask to talk to the owner myself, and they refuse rudely. The whole time, everyone is super disrespectful and insulting, and treat me like I am a criminal. All the other reviews here can't seem to stop raving about how friendly and helpful 'Ray' is - so is he going to do anything about this?

Really, the hummus is amazing - it comes with oil, herbs, and spicy stuff on top, and you mix it all together to make the most perfect goodness.  At $2.99, it's a steal.", "author": "N. S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-12", "description": "Their sandwiches are super generous with the meat and generally cost $4.5, under $6 if you throw in some avocado and/or cheese.  Plus, the special red onion, pepperoncini, and jalapeno sauce is damn tasty.  Moreover, they don't add an excessive CRV charge for Arizona Iced Tea tall boys--just $0.99, like it says on the can.  And they have a great selection of said cans, including the elusive Energy Tonic, my personal favorite.  Plus, the family that works there and probably owns the place are super friendly.  My expectations for a corner store are well exceeded.", "author": "Alan R."}

Secondly, try the Pastrami, I found it by accident. He's so good I just ask him to make whatever he feels like making. I've eaten about 20-25 of his sandwiches never knowing what i'll get till I get home. He's the Leonardo of sandwich culture!", "author": "Michael R."}

His son sometimes man's the register while watching football and their banter feels like being in a family's or friend's living room and kitchen. \n\nAltogether, the kind of small family business you may not believe exists in more cynical moments...", "author": "Charles D."}

The former owner had a filthy place and sold 40-ouncers to the homeless. About 4 months ago it was sold to a great guy who has brought a jewel to the neighborhood. Pluses:\n1. Huge variety of wine, ports, champagne including 2 Buck Chuck and lots of Aussies. He always tells you when you buy a white wine if he has one chilled. He also has a punch card good for 1 freebie after 10 purchases.\n2. Service - I bought a bunch of stuff for my St. Paddies party and he had his helper carry it home and into my kitchen for me. How often does that happen in SF?\n3. Variety - he keeps some fresh stuff, but has lovely olives, capers, mustards, dressings and etceteras on the shelves with the staples at fair prices.\n4. Deli - he makes a huge sandwich and piles on the meat for cheap, and he's fixing up a deli counter in the rear for Mid Eastern yummies.\n5. Smiles - the owner is the greatest - always waves to me on my way to the bus, has fresh flowers, newspapers, and I have vowed to shop here at least once a week even if I don't need anything because this is the type of store that is giving the neighborhood back to the residents instead of the creeps on the street.\n\nNo minuses. Three cheers for R Image!", "author": "OffToRio B."}

We were visiting San Francisco from out of town and popped into R to pick up a bottle of whiskey for our hosts. First, the place had a great selection. It's basically everything you'd want out of a convenience store, plus more. For example, it has a deli that serves Boar's Head meat. Love that stuff. And I remember feeling like there would have been plenty of bottles of wine to choose from, if we were buying that instead of whiskey. The real appeal, though, was talking to the guy who worked there. We talked to him for maybe 20 minutes about the store and life in San Francisco. You can just tell that this guy works hard, takes a lot of pride in his store, and cares about the customer service experience. You don't see that kind of enthusiasm and sincerity all that often. He's the exact kind of business owner you want in your community, and I wish I had an R in my neighborhood back home! If you're choosing between the tons of places to buy those everyday things in the Mission, pick these guys. They deserve your business.", "author": "Elena V."}

He's personable, thoughtful and remembers his regular customers. There are also several young men who work there that are also quite wonderful. The usual young man behind the sandwich bar, with the glasses and dark hair, is sweet as pie and makes a damn good sandwich. The red-headed young man is also, always personable and funny. As for whom I take to be the youngest worker, the one with the brown hair and flat face, well, I'm pretty sure he is the spawn of satan. I have been coming to R Image for 3 years, and he never seems to remember me. He never smiles, and even though I am 30 years old, he asks for my ID every time. My fiance, however, he knows by name, and is friendly with. I've talked to him several times, asking why he feels the need to ID check me constantly, even though I'm in there three times a week. He pretends to be sorry, and sarcastically remarks he will remember me next time. Needless to say, he doesn't. Jerk. Tonight I stopped by for some food, and he short changed me by a dollar. I told him this, and he dismissed me completely and rudely. I'm kicking myself now for not being more forceful. It's a shame that I tend to hold grudges, but what's the point of going to a friendly, neighborhood market, if it's not friendly? Goodbye, R Image. I'm taking my champagne-addicted shopping habits elsewhere.", "author": "Jo B."}

Unlike the other little stores around here,  R Image seems to carry a lot of interesting and useful groceries and everything is not overpriced.  They even have stuff like charcoal, cold medicine,  a selection of important produce items (that I always seem to run out of such as garlic, lemons, limes, potatoes, bananas & tomatoes), lots of gourmet & organic products, and a great selection of beer & wine.
