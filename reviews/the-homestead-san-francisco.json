{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-21", "description": "Let's be honest. \"Happening\" neighborhood bars in the West Bay are a dime a dozen these days, and the Homestead is no exception.\n\nYes, the venue has a rustic, saloon-like feel to it. Yes, there are antiquish touches throughout. Yes, it tries to be down-home and casual enough so that you can feel free to throw your peanut shells onto the floor instead of cleaning up after yourself like a civilized human being like your Momma taught you to. Yes, the prices and service are decent, but at the end of the day it's the same gentrified, borderline self-absorbed crowd you'll see anywhere in the West Bay.\n\nSo what's so special about it? Cue the sound of crickets chirping. It's simply a neighborhood bar. And that's about it. Just because it's located in a supposedly \"hot\" neighborhood, let alone the West Bay, doesn't mean it's the best thing since sliced bread.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Only one which is a little too strong for me unless it's a light beer Guinness. I will drink it now the beer. I do like Japanese Sapporo. I'm not sure what the other name is for the other Japanese beer, but I also like Belgian beer which is Stella. It's light. It's crisp. They also had a Christmas blend beer which I didn't get to taste, but I heard that my sister in law and brother liked it had a little cinnamon and some other spices little flavors in it. They enjoyed the beers that they ordered: Hammerstein Guinness, some Christmas blend, and Stella beer.\nOh one more thing there was a fireplace and we SAT right next to it so we were very warm and cozy, and they also give you a basket of peanuts which you can  conversating while  drinking your beer.  \nAnd above me had they had alcohol glass case and a cross from me was a naked portrait of a woman with Tatas that the men would love. lol\nThanks for reading my review. ~Liz~ :)", "author": "Lizzie G."}

Came in here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night, while conveniently getting some laundry done next door, for a beer and cocktail. We walked in and after walking back and forth to get the bartenders attention we found two seats. The bartender walked past us several times but refused to even look at us. There were two guys next to us and he asked them if they wanted another beer but not once glanced over at us. Then another lady walked in and sat down and not a minute passed by when he took her order and served her right away. Then he continued to walk by us and not even glance over at us. I have been living in this area for 21 years and I really wanted to like the bar hoping it would become a regular spot for us but I guess the bartender ruined that for us.

While, yes, the hipster-to-normal-person ration was violently askew, ask yourself, \"Self: where are you?\" Get the answer. Go back to doing what you were doing.\n\nNow, with such a popular venue, it may be difficult to find a place to rest your tired legs. If so, simply do what I did: growl at the fellows lazing about four seats (2 guys, 4 seats; is this a new internet meme?) at the bar until they get uncomfortable (read: scared) and they leave. Problem solved. Even though the bar tends to fall on the crowded side of the aisle, it's not so loud that you can't spend some quality time catching up with one of your best friends in the world.\n\nI found the bartender to be pretty cool. He wasn't overly chatty but he was attentive, polite and d@mn good at his job. I started the evening with a Blood & Sand -- because they make me feel fancybroody. This one was expertly made. The scotch was the star of the show but the liqueur brightened it up enough to make it dangerously drinkable. The vermouth added to the aromatic quality of the drink and the blood orange just makes it look cool. After a couple of those, I decided to switch to beer because I had to work in the morning and calling in sick wasn't an option. But besides the skill behind the bar, cool vibe and relaxed scene, my favorite element of The Homestead is the Scooby Doo quality.

I told the bouncer that I was 101 years old, but he checked my ID anyway (and said I looked good for my age). Amazingly, it wasn't too crowded, and we managed to snag a table right next to the upright piano, which was serving as a drink-stand. It reportedly gets its keys tickled every so often, so I didn't feel too bad for it.\n\nHomestead has a great collection of beers, including big bottles of Belgian blondes, and they make fantastic mixed drinks. For $1 you can tuck into a deep bowl of peanuts, smoky and salty. Cracking them open while chatting with friends has to be one of the most satisfying bar activities, aside from petting the wayward pooch that makes its way under your table and allows you to scratch it behind the ears.\n\nThere's something uniquely comforting about the luxurious velvet drapes, beautiful wallpaper, antique tin roof and paintings of nudes; it brings class to a bar that would otherwise be a dive. Said my friend, \"Would it be porn if those were photos instead of paintings? Such a fine line...\" Beware, as the back room is reserved and you may get booted; otherwise, the crowd is fun and friendly.

At one point, we were led in a group rendition of \"happy birthday\" for someone whose name I didn't catch. In London, this would be the most embarrassing thing that could happen on a night out. In The Homestead, it was just a bit of fun from which you could seamlessly go back to your conversation.\n\nI don't know if it was the mixing or the ambiance or the lack of ice in my glass, but my Sazerac tasted better there than it ever has in London.

Because it's a place I had bookmarked and wanted to try, and we were half mile away, I made their asses walk over there with me. Yep!\n\nIt was a Thursday night, we got there around 8:30, and it was about half full. The bar has a wide selection of liquors, AND Boddington's beer on tap. double snaps! The Jukebox is full of David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Elvis Costello, Rolling Stones and other great rock. There's bowls of peanuts at the bar for you to munch on too!\n\nI love the way the place looks- from the outside in. The side door was open when we got there, and although it was nippy out (lol, SF, when you not nippy?) the breeze felt nice. It made the peanut shells on the floor, under a bulldog sitting in a chair, swirl around on the floor. That's right- there are dogs allowed in this bar, on a leash, and every dog I've seen here (2 at most at one time, really) is well behaved, well groomed, and adorably friendly. (And no, the dogs are never bullied or given any booze.)\n\nI see the word \"hipster\" in these previous reviews, and yeah, alright, I suppose. They're hip people, sure. But the people here are nice and friendly and funny as hell. Met some awesome people here! Reminds me of the places I used to frequent and my friends back home. \n\nThe prices are consistent, reasonable, and LOW. Just the other night, 4 beers and 2 whiskey sours cost $25. I MEAN, COME ON. (That was pre tip, ladies & germs... tip your bartenders well. They are your friends.)\n\nLet me divulge that I live in the Parkside. I trek over here often to enjoy the drinks and the atmosphere. It's become my special little watering hole, despite me living a decent amount of miles from it. It's worth going over to.", "author": "Savannah P."}

You'll see every type of person, and the peanuts at the bar are wonderful for snacking after a few too many brews. \n\nI think my favorite moment of the evening came when myself and a couple others headed outside to smoke some cigars.

Ironically, the bartender walks outside, and tells us the CIGARS were bothering her even though we were further down the block, while the guys with the joints were clearly not an issue for her.

I live in the hood and have been a handful of times in the last year or so, and it's always been cool. Love the dogs, the peanuts, the wallpaper, the jukebox. All of it. \n\nThis review is less a review of the bar, and more a review of the bartender. Here goes: Dear girl bartender with the long dark hair and tattoos: You. Are. Awful. My boyfriend and I came in on Friday night, right around 7:30. You were not busy. We sat down at the bar, I smiled a hello at you. You did not smile back. Fine. You waited on someone else who sat down around the same time we did. No worries there, we'll be next, right? Nope. It's time to wait on the guy who JUST walked up to the bar. You're smiling at him and being super friendly. Encouraging! So excited to order our drinks! Oh, but wait....now you're helping the girl who literally just walked up right next to me. You're being really nice to her, as well. Maybe...now...we can...no? You're going to wait on another couple who are basically standing behind us? Oh, but you're being a super bitch to them, but hey, at least they're getting a drink (you don't like couples, honey, do you?)\n\nUgh. At this point I ASKED her if we could order drinks and she responded with \"yep\" without making eye contact. The only reason she's getting two stars instead of one is that she made me a proper whiskey drink and poured a proper beer for my boyfriend.  I can't understand why she was being so nasty to us, as I don't typically inspire nastiness in bartenders (I've had loads of bartender friends over the years, and I know how to be a good customer), but she's ensured that I'll never, ever come back in for a drink.

The corner entrance makes me imagine a pair of flapping bar doors where cowboys and gamblers swing aside on their way to feed their additions.\n\nOnce I walked in I saw a room of colorful, very hip bar patrons. They plaid shirts and driving caps filled the room. A few out-of-place individuals hugged the walls like flies.\n\nIn the back is a room for renting if you so wish. I asked about it for my birthday, and was told by friends it's as cheap as $20 for the evening. Unfortunately they have just raised the rate to $50 a night. understandable. The room fits about 20 people and has chairs and tables. I will find a reason to use it eventually.\n\nI felt completely at home there (no pun intended).

Met up with a couple friends for a chill Thursday evening drink - they were already there, and my friend and I arrived and I ordered 2 drinks at the bar. I was asked for ID (for the first time ever at that bar), so I obliged even though I thought it was weird. Then the bartender insisted that she see a 2nd ID for the other drink, and my friend, who had just gotten off a flight from London, had left her passport at home. The waitress then insisted that we leave the \"establishment,\" despite our suggestion that my friend doesn't get a drink and we just hang. I was quite calm and asked if she'd really checked everyone's ID in the bar. She didn't answer and went to get another bartender (I believe could be the same one that appears in the other bad review below), who said that they check everyone's IDs. My friends confirmed no one had checked theirs. I ask her \"so if I call the cops and have them come and check everyone's IDs here, you're sure everyone will pass?\" to which she replies \"well you can do that but you need to leave my establishment right now.\" \n\nI should have placed a call, but figured the cops have better things to do than tend to the whims of some arrogant and discriminatory bartenders. If you want the chill local neighborhood-y bar experience, which this place USED to provide, just walk 2 blocks away from it and go to Shotwell's.

Over 40 and way NOT. \n\nBut my friend who is a bit of a connoisseur of tequila got a 1/2 for her first shot. Short shots only work in muggings, oy, sorry. Admittedly the very nice bartender overheard her and gave her a second shot for free (and yes we did pour it in the original glass and yes, it was a way short shot.) My marguerita was nicely fresh lime juiced per my request but if there was any tequila in there, I missed it. Both were $6/USD.\n\nAmbiance is old western saloon. I say that with some authenticity bc my dad comes from Meeteetse, WY. I spent a couple of nights last summer in a saloon in Cody, WY and they had the same pressed tin ceiling. The Homestead has way more tasteful naked ladies on the wall. VEWY sexy. \n\nI would give it a second chance, esp since parking is pretty easy on a weeknight.", "author": "Miel H."}

She literally threw my drink on the bar so hard that it spilled enough liquid  to soak the drink napkin entirely, leaving me to preside over a puddle of vodka. The bar was mostly empty, so this was not a \"rushing bartender\" type thing. She mumbled something to husband and slammed his beer down as well.

I was so appalled I had to stay for more punishment... you know, like watching a train wreck? She's just having a bad day? We ordered a second drink and waited for her \"royal\" treatment.

You can throw peanuts on the floor here (!!)and they still have the Dylan Thomas quote above the bar to pay homage to the fantastic watering hole which occupied the building before. One curious thing though, the window says the bar has been there since 1902 which isn't true unless 1902 means 2005.

I'd heard very good things about it and was happy my brain decided to function at above normal capacity, so I actually remembered I'd heard it was great, remembered it was on Folsom, and then, most importantly, remembered to go there at the proper, convenient, serendipitous time. I never do that. I always find myself drinking at the same old place, bored stiff. Then on my way home I smack myself in the forehead, let loose a mighty D'OH! and realize that I could have spent the whole evening somewhere new and different. \n\nThe Homestead is a little bit like your grandma's house in that pleasant, cozy, non-smelly way. It has pretty fuzzy red wallpaper, lovely wooden details and a sparse yet classy ambiance. The bartender was ever-so sweet and the crowd in the bar were clearly local, neighborhood types and my only complaint about them is that they seemed to fear the jukebox. The Brewer and I were the only ones stepping up to the musical plate. Which I guess isn't all bad. \n\nTheir beer selection doesn't suck, but it ain't great either.
