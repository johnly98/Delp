Is there even a difference? Do they serve actual pigeons?\n\nWill I come back? Of course!

I probably waited for 15 minutes before it was my turn to order.\n\nThere are some tables if you want to eat there as well, but I was there strictly for takeout. My coworker really likes the chasiu (barbecue pork) and the soy sauce chicken here, so even though I'm not big on chasiu I decided to try it out. \n\nThe barbecue pork is $8/lb, and the roast duck is $10 for half or $19.50 for a whole duck. I bought two pieces of the pork and a whole duck and walked out with my wallet $32 lighter. Not too bad, but somehow still more than I was expecting to spend.\n\nThe chasiu was definitely one of the best ones I've had, in my limited experience. It's well flavored and not dry at all. However, it does run on the sweet side, so I ended up cooking it at home with some low sodium soy sauce to try and get it to be a little bit more savory. The duck was pretty standard and I enjoyed every bite of it.\n\nThis place isn't too far from me, so I definitely see myself coming back whenever I get a craving for Chinese bbq!", "author": "Dianna H."}

She went ahead and charged me extra.\nLots of times the duck rice plate is fat and burned hidden as well.\nThe latest, I ordered halve soy sauce chicken, halve duck and a bit of the pork cheek to go. The chicken was OK, the duck was hella fat and burned. Almost halve of it was not eatable. The last few times I noticed their foods didn't taste as good as before.

You can order meats to go or sit at one of their tables and order one of the rice plates with these bbq delicacies. I have noticed the portions have gotten a little smaller but still a tasty lunch deal. Service is very casual. Lots of Chinese contractors come for lunch here.

Beware of line cutters.  \n*Ming Kee (formerly named Happy Bakery & Deli) reopened last week after burning down from a fire 1.5 years ago (my review: http://bit.ly/M4Ku2P). They had a temporary location on Irving street for 8 months (my review: http://bit.ly/1jWZCeK).\n*Ming Kee is a Chinese deli that sells your typical roast meats. For chicken, you have a choice of regular or \"yellow\" free range chicken which is a lot bonier but has more flavor. \n*Signature items: Princess Chicken (free range steamed chicken w/ ginger & scallion sauce) & Soy Sauce Chicken.\n*MUST ORDER the Cha Siu: BBQ Pork jowl/neck portion ($8): http://bit.ly/1clFDEU\n*Staff doesn't speak or understand much English.\n*6-7 tables for seating\n*CASH ONLY\n*Reason for downgrade from their previous locations?\n\nA) Prices are 18-28% higher than their previous locations. For example, a whole duck was $15 and is now $19. Rice plate combos were $7ish and are now $9.50.\n\nB) Quality seems to have declined and/or we got a bad batch. I ordered the Princess Chicken & Soy Sauce Chicken Combo ($8.50 + $2 for free range \"yellow\" chicken): http://bit.ly/1d4O2s6. The free-range princess chicken was not as good as I remembered it to be and the ginger-scallion sauce needed more oil. The free-range soy sauce chicken was horrible; it was like incredibly dry turkey breast meat and it was hella salty.\n\nC) Unprofessional behavior. Lady #1 kept ordering Lady #2 around (to clear tables, take orders, and grab tea) and rudely yelled at her on multiple occasions in front of customers. Granted, I found some of her comments (about us) to be comical but I felt really bad for Lady #2 as she seemed bullied and embarrassed.

Unfortunately after they shut down the Irving location, the stir fry chef either stayed on with Guangdong or left for other pastures. It seemed that cheap a$$ local$ thought MK was super overpriced, and they preferred lower quality competitor Lam Hoa Thuan Restaurant's roasties down the street, and sadly higher quality MK could not compete with that ingrained thinking. It just goes to show that some people prefer value with lower quality over something that may cost just a tad more but you get so much more mileage. What can I say. A$N cheapen$$ can sometimes manifest into a mental disorder in the wrong direction. \n\nBut the king being back, unfortunately does not translate to a happy kingdom at the moment. The king was out of comission for at least a year, and seemed to have lost his mojo. The king still has a lot of loyal fans in the hood, so if there are picky buggers (or Yelpers for that matter) it's no loss in the short term. Locals seem unphased by the negative reviews thus far. \n\nA few issues with the current Ming Kee (now back in the original location)\n\n- prices seemed to have crept up a bit\n- consistency and quality seem to fluctuate depending on your roll of the dice and time of day. \n- no more stir fry, like in the previous Irving location\n- stripped down dine in menu of mostly rice plates and a few other things\n- reports of inability to pick and choose the specific cuts of roasties you want and being given the bad ones (could be the entire batch is not prime that day)\n- customization of rice plates (e.g an off menu pairing of certain roasties combinations) may be met with re$i$tance in the form of unexpected price increa$e$.\n\nAs well as other random issues. \n\nBut really...where else are you going to find half decent roasties in this area? In some ways, Ming Kee has retained that neighborhood deli flavor. For me I will continue to patronize them and not Cheung Hing, who don't know how to properly season and process their roasties (and no, mass and volume does not mean quality).\n \nFOBenese quicktips on MK:\n\n- MK cuts their cha siu (BBQ pork) a lot thinner than the competition. The marination is on the sweeter side. Eat this with rice for best results. Order leanest cut, because you might end up with some fatty pieces. If you are adventurous, try pairing with garlic bread at home, or a banh mi with other seasonings. Or create the \"golden chicken coin\" and mash it up with chicken liver...\n\n- I would wait a while before ordering crispy skin roast pork. They may still be trying to figure out roasting with the new rig.\n\n- BBQ pork neck meat (jowl) is fantastic but uber fatty. Of course it is pricier, there are only two cheeks to a pig. Don't be $hocked if it costs a bit more. Indulge in moderation.\n\n- soy sauce chicken, as delicious as always\n\n- ask for a container of ginger scallion oil. You might pay a little more but it adds to the experience.\n\n- for best results, dine in, unless you plan to eat your takeout immediately after getting home. It is cash only so bring ample bills. For even better results, get one rice plate and entrees (no rice) of roasties.\n\n- roast goose depends on your luck. The luck being a combination of availability and nailing it down where it tastes reasonable. Availability is already a mini jackpot, so don't push your luck too much just yet. \n\nI hope they overcome the issues with consistency and perhaps scaling. \n\nIn the old movie, I believe Stella did get her groove back. I can only hope MK will in time as well.", "author": "Ken K."}

I got the bbq pork over rice. it was ready pretty quickly -I was lucky it wasn't that busy when I came in. So they give you a lot of rice. Its basically like 80% rice, topped with 10% bbq pork and 10% lettuce..but it was pretty good.", "author": "Carmen L."}

I'm glad I tried this place because it has a delicious duck/BBQ pork plate. For 9 dollars, you get rice, veggie, two meats and this onion thing you put onto duck. You need to speak Chinese to order or point to the menu item. Overall the service is meh but the food is legit.", "author": "Ricky C."}

The owner is an old lady chief commander \"yellow chicken\"  you will notice her the first you step in this place.  She likes to micro manage every details and manipulate her staff which i really don't care but her voice is really breaking my ear drums!  Peaceful is what we missed....", "author": "Cookie M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-04", "description": "Typical Chinese restaurant, no wonder CHINESE restaurant can't make it big and famous like the American restaurant. They are rude and don't know how to treat customer and they nickel and dime you on everything, extra for  an take out container, extra for sauce. Their prices went up a lot already and they still want to squeeze more out of the customers. You don't really want to put up with their crap. You can do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere where you will be treated a lot nicer.", "author": "Allie T."}

I couldn't find the menu online so I called to get an idea on the prices and what they have for an entree. The woman who speaks limited English said \"no we don't have the menu, ok thank you\". Wtf??? Do you NOT want businesses? I was going to place a to-go order but guess not. I tried to get her attention and by speaking very slowly; \"How much for food?\" to break it down for her and make it easier. But she said \"No, we don't have food. Thank you\". Uhm..that's super awkward. Look, I appreciate authentic ethnic food, so authentic that the staff don't speak English well (it is San Francisco after all!) but when  you can not tell people how much your entrees are, AND there isn't a menu available online, there's a huge problem with how you're running your business. If how they run the business is indicative of their food, I would not go there. Guess I dodged a bullet. Bye!", "author": "Clint S."}

I'm half Chinese half Peruvian so I dont really look like either, still no one was rude, service was timely and everything tasted great. I ordered the Roast Duck and Char Siu Pork plate and my friend had the Yellow Chicken, Both dishes were out in about 5 minutes, The bill came out to $15 not including tip, Which is really cheap for 2 people, we were both full and satisfied. I came here because of how busy it looked one day walking by, now other reviews also say these people are pushy and such, they must not have much experience living in the city, if you want to be treated like a princess expect to pay a bit more than $8 a plate, if you want a nice quick meal for cheap, this is your place.", "author": "Bruce W."}

On the first day it reopened, I attended and had a dine in. I had roasted duck with rice and cabbage. It was extremely tasty. The roasted duck was not flavored with so much spice that you had to drink gallons of water after, but wasn't flavored too little to have no taste of what you ate. What stood out to me the most was the personalities of the workers. Each and everyone of them, let it be the custodian or the store owner, were absolutely kind. How do I know? When it came the time to pay( it came up to a total of $6.75 for a Roast duck plate, again, very worth for the price paid!) I only had a debit card on me. (I didn't read the $15 minimum for the use of a bank card.) While everyone looked at me like I was one of those people who ate without paying, the store owner told me with a reassuring voice that it was okay, and to bring cash next time. Then she made sure everyone knew that everything was settled. I left a $5 tip because the workers were truly amazing. If there were to a negative, it would be the trouble to find parking. Ocean Avenue is normally very crowded with cars. Other than that, I highly recommend this restaurant. Couldn't have asked for better!", "author": "Brandon H."}
