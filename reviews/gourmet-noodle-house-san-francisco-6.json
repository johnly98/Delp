Anyway, what I was hoping to get as an appetizer, \u9999\u5e72\u99ac\u862d\u982d (bean curd with ma-lan veggies), was not on the menu anymore. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Scallion oil noodles with dry shrimp (\u8525\u6cb9\u62cc\u9eb5): supposed to be classic Shanghainese, a bit too much sauce, but the fried scallion was nice. Al dente noodles were nice. \n- Vegetable and pumpkin noodle soup: lots of veggies which was nice, but overall the flavor was a little off. \n- Wood ear and cucumber appetizer: not bad, not outstanding either. \n\nOverall, an OK restaurant, but nothing to write home about.", "author": "Wendy K."}

This places was not crowded nor empty, they seated us right away. The only thing was that they didn't give us the menu for another 5 mins when we asked. All the workers speak mandarin and it was a little hard to communicate sometimes.\n\nWe got the Beef, Clam and Tomato noodle soup. The noodles are sooo good! They were a nice slippery chewy noodle in a nice tomato soup. It's perfect for a cold day or if you're feeling sick. The noodles were not super heavy either, they were thin and easy to pick up. I think they make their own noodles too. I was very satisfied.\n\nThe Wontons in chili oil and peanut sauce were very good too. It was a simple dish that taste so flavorful and complex. You can see them cooking it from where I was sitting because the kitchen was pretty open for people to see.\n\nI got a soy milk to drink that was supposed to be sweet, I saw them put regular sugar in it but it did not taste that good so I feel like it was not worth getting.\n\nOverall I would definitely come here again and try all the other noodle soups as well!", "author": "Ada N."}

So my suggestion is that know what you want before you go in to avoid a long wait. A table behind me is literally fighting among themselves because the grandma and the mom wants to cancel the order while the son and daughter wanna just be a bit more patient and wait for their food. \n\nthey need to hire some more help front or they will loose a lot of repeat customers. We are here twice for the past two days and have seen many of customers left angry. \n\nI think this place is one of the selective few restaurants that does Chinese and American Chinese dishes right. When we came here for lunch the restaurant was pretty much full with half Chinese customer ordering some really authentic shanghainese dishes and other none Chinese customers ordering American Chinese dishes like beef broccoli over rice. \n\nVery tasty noodle dishes such as beef noodle soup and my fav noodle with scallion and dry shrimp( N25 this dish is dry, no soup). Some great appetizers as well, loved the smoked fish, bamboo shoot and you gotta try A17, bean curd with ma lan vegetables, very rare dish, hard to find. We also liked the house special pan fried pork bun, very delicious! \n\nI agree with some of the reviews that service can be slow since there is only one lady works at the front. She is very chatty to the point it might be annoying but I guess she needs someone to talk to since she is the only one working at the front. A great place to eat!

We were hungry and using the GPS to help us find a decent place to eat.  Weirdly enough, some restaurants in the area were closed. After some time (and a few blocks) we spotted this cute restaurant and I'm truly thankful! I ordered the Beef satay soup which I ordered \"mildly spicy\". It came back with the perfect kick I was looking for--just enough, but not too much that it takes away from the flavor experience.  I loved the bok choy, the flavor of the broth and the noodles.  My First-Born had the beef tendons & it looked & tasted (according to him) very delicious.  Although I was very happy with my choice, I found myself having food envy & wanting his food choice. LOL! The Huz and my Youngest both had the Meatball Soup.  It included two gigantic flavorful meatballs.  They were very happy!

I eat out all the time and price is not an issue but i will never order anything else from besides the dumplings.

It's not a very cozy restaurant so heat and hot tea made the experience better. The service was good and they were friendly and the servers spoke both Mandarin and Cantonese. The dishes came out fast and fresh. We liked reading over their menu because it had a few dishes we don't typically see on menus of other Shanghai restaurants such as Marinated Egg, Soybean in Wine Sauce, Eel Noodle Soup and Smoked Fish but we weren't in the mood to try something new today. We went with the usuals: Shanghai Steamed Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Chive, Shrimp & Pork Dumplings, Spicy Wonton, Ji Vegetable & Pork Rice Cake (new to us), and Garlic Spinach. The Xiao Long Bao and dumplings were really good. We liked the tasty broth in the Xiao Long Bao and there were big pieces of shrimp in the dumplings. We didn't care for the spicy wonton though. The peanut sauce on the wonton was bland and not spicy. The rice cakes were different than the regular Shanghai style ones because the vegetable was something we hadn't had before and we really liked the flavor. We loved the Sesame Pancake stuffed with green onions. They have dessert options too so we tried the Black Glutinous Rice Pudding. It's not pudding but is a sticky black rice dish stuffed with red bean paste. I've never had or seen anything like it before and it was ok. I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad. I just expected an actual pudding. We'll try this place again for their other menu options.", "author": "Jen L."}

It doesn't matter which to me, as it's the first real Shanghai-style \"mian guan\" (noodle house) I've encountered n SF. Think of it as a Chinese counterpart to a ramen house, and order a bowl of noodles and a small side dish or two to flesh out (or veg out) your meal. The noodles are all made (though not hand-pulled) in house, as they would be in any respectable Shanghai noodle joint, as are the xiao long bao.\n\nI highly recommend the yellowfish noodles (N4 on the menu), an excellent version of what has become a classic Shanghai noodle dish. The server will warn you of the possibility of small bones in your soup, as it's almost impossible to de-bone a yellow croaker of all its fine bones, but I found no bones in mine. I also lucked out with my choice of fried tofu as an appetizer. It had a pile of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside cubes of tofu interlaced with slices of jalapenos and onions, a bargain at $3.95.\n\nOn my first visit I checked out the house-make xiao long bao (because it was there) and the savory soy milk soup (xian doujiang, which oddly appeared under \"drinks\" on the menu). Both were respectable though not great, though they aren't the point here. Noodles are.", "author": "Gary S."}

I guess Din Tai Feng still holds its reputation for the best xiao long bao.\n\n(2) Stewed Beef, Tomato and Clam with Noodle Soup (N4) - My older son chose this and it's quite appetizing. The broth was rich in flavor fresh tomatoes and clams. \n\n(3) Fried Beef with Black Pepper Sauce and Noodle (N24) - A bit on the bland side, this dish really has not much to offer. I've had better. Skip it as there are many selections here.\n\n(4) House Special Beef Flank Noodle Soup (Spicy, N11) - this is pretty good. Beef Flank was very tender and broth was flavorful. Noodles were fresh pulled ones which gave the chewy texture. Could have been a bit more generous with their beef flanks. \n\n(5) Shrimp and Chive Dumpling (S2) - we had to cancel this one because there was NO SHRIMP in the dumpling at all. Why would they name it Shrimp and Chive dumpling if there were no shrimp in it? I brought it to their attention and the waitress told us that's the way it is. Well, glad she was willing to cancel the order. \n\nStop on by if you are looking for some Chinese comfort food other than dim sum.", "author": "Em T."}

I tried to like this place (would always welcome the opportunity to frequent another Shanghainese restaurant) but a second visit is just never going to happen. \n\nUnlike most Chinese restaurants, the service was shockingly good but the quality of both the ingredients and cooking was poor.  Most of the beef flank in the noodle soup was not edible as it consisted mostly of chewy gristly tendon that even curls.  The allegedly handpulled noodles were too perfect and did not resemble homemade noodles.  I had never (until today) felt pork inside Shanghainese dumplings (xiao long baos) were of bad quality because it's usually fatty juicy meat anyways, but it was obvious that the meat quality was very poor when the meat made crunchy sounds.  I think the straw that broke the camel's back was the watered down black vinegar that accompanied the xiao long baos--who does that??!!  A really cheap Chinese restaurant willing to sacrifice quality--that's who!\n\nThe lion's head meatballs were very soft and tender but not flavorful; I just knew the meat quality was poor after eating the other two dishes so I did not feel the need to finish the dish (my kids, on the other hand, did finish the meatballs but they are not picky).  We had to send the garlic spinach back since it was SOOOO salty and greasy--it was the FIRST time I didn't feel right feeding my kids veggies!\n\nI was surprised by the decent Yelp reviews but I'm thinking the other reviewers are not very discriminatory.", "author": "Marina S."}

I waited for 20 minutes and the wonton arrived but without the yellow fish.  It is just a typical Chinese restaurant which does not know the meaning of service.  I waited for another 3 minutes and the yellow fish did not come so I had to start to eat the wonton before it is getting too cold. \nThe wonton broth was basically water.  It did not have any salt, bland and just slightly warmer than the room temperature. Inside the clay pot, there were 6 tiny wonton but not even one single piece of vegetable.  The wontons were so small, I could eat two at once.  The whole wonton clay plot does not even have more than $1 of ingredients within.\nBy the time I finished the wonton, the yellow fish was still not there.  I waited for another minute and gave up.  I walked up to the cashier and told her I want the check and canceled the yellow fish.  She charged me the yellow fish because they had made it already.

We were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress who can speak Mandarin, Cantonese and English. We ordered shanghai salted chicken (4/5),  shanghai dumplings (4/5), house special noodle soup with beef flanks (3/5), and lion head meatball noodle soup (5/5). We both like the lion head meatball noodle soup! The meatballs (you get 2 pieces only) are well-seasoned and the soup is somewhat bland, but they go so well together. The home-made noodle itself is fresh and chewy. Highly recommend you to order the lion head noodle soup. The dumplings are juicy, but the skin is too thick.  The house special noodle soup was too spicy for me to finish it all and the beef flanks were a bit overcooked which made it hard to chew. I would definitely go back for more lion head meatballs noodle soup.", "author": "Cindy W."}

And the twice cooked pork is good.   The dumplings aren't that good.  A little pricey for what you get i think. Clean and good service though.", "author": "CR L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-17", "description": "The 'Shanghai style fish' appetizer and the 'lion head meatball noodle soup' are my usuals here.  They're quite good.  I would stay away from their dishes involving clams or other seafood as those are not guaranteed to be fresh (like the 'beef, tomato clam noodle soup'...you will want to spit the clams out and fort/unfort there are only like 4 of them in the soup dish).  Overall the flavors are authentic Chinese so I do rank this among the top chinese restaurants I'd like to frequent in the neighborhood.", "author": "Evelyn H."}

The food can be hit or miss but most things I've had were tasty. The service can be lackluster. I placed an online order for pickup, then when I walked in 20 min later, judging from the look on their faces/the discussions they promptly had, it was obvious they had forgotten my order. Tell me, what's the point of ordering in advance if you're going to forget my order and make me wait there anyway?", "author": "Eric H."}

Got the beef shank noodle soup and sheng jian bao - both were very tasty. The sheng jian bao was served Shanghaineae style and was very well done.", "author": "Christel C."}
