We came here for lunch on Thanksgiving Day, and the restaurant was almost full, maybe because it is known among the locals in the area. \n\nWe ordered three dishes and a fried rice. Prices are affordable, most items are $8 or $9. They have a luncheon special during the weekdays from 11:30-3pm where dishes are only $6.50 or $6.95. \n\nHunan beef: This was pretty good. The beef was tender. There's not a lot of meat however. This dish is a little bit spicy. \n\nTofu and shrimp: Not my favorite dish. It was a bit lackluster. It would have probably tasted better if it was cooked spicy. \n\nBaby bok choy with black mushroom: Portion size is not really that big. The bok choy was cooked perfectly. It wasn't cooked for too long, so each bite was crunchy, exactly how it should be. \n\nCombination fried rice: Flavorful, but could use more meat. \n\nOverall, the food here is pretty good, but I wish they were more generous with their ingredients. They also deliver for free after 5pm if you purchase a $25 minimum.", "author": "Julia K."}

We had been going there every week for quite some time now.   We tried a variety of dishes over the years; everything is really good.  Our favorites are dumplings, chive pockets, beef noodle soups, tea duck, string beans, and spicy chicken wings.  The dumplings and chive pockets are hand made by the owner; she says that's how she ensures the taste is consistent.  She sometimes stays up past midnight to make the batch for next day.  All the noodle dishes use freshly hand made noodles and are quite good.  \n\nThe service is fast, but there could be a wait on weekends.  The owner has to work very, very hard every time I see her.  Sometimes her friends (customers dining at the time) would jump in and help her serve the tables.  I asked why she doesn't hire additional help; she says the business is inconsistent; when they are busy, everyone seems to show up all at once.  However, the place could sometimes be empty on weekdays, and that's why she can't afford another full time employee.  So for those that complains long delivery time, please understand that this small business can't afford to hire extra help, and things do get a little crazy sometimes.  In fact, I would never order delivery unless you like mediocre food. Chinese food tastes best when they are fresh.  If you leave hot food in take out boxes, everything starts to taste soggy and over cooked.", "author": "El C."}

The portion is pretty large too.\n\nNoodles: don't remember the specific name, but it had some sesame-peanutty sauce to it.  It had mushrooms and pork as well.  The portion of noodles itself was a bit ridiculous- it was a huge bowl food of noodles.  Unfortunately, the noodles kind of clumped together and it was a bit difficult to mix the sauce through the noodles.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty okay.  It was hot and filled me up.

Is there one huge chinese kitchen factory in San Francisco with massive vats of the same stuff? Because this place tastes exactly like sooooo many other delivery places in the west side of SF (Sunset, Richmond, Glen Park). Bottom line.... Meh.\n\nHere's what we sampled:\n\nChive, Shrimp, Pork Dumplings (12) $6.95\n-- OK\n\nShrimp Chow Fun $7.55\n-- Oily mushy noodles, bland shrimp\n\nVegetable Fried Rice (free with order)\n--- Bland. Cheap frozen diced vegetables.\n\nWalnut Prawns $9.95\n-- Bland frozen (for near eternity) shrimp.\n\nSeafood Deluxe Soup (S) $6.95\n-- OMG... DELUXE???? I would have expected a cornucopia of shellfish and fish. Not so. A couple of shrimp and scollop pieces. The rest, frozen diced vegetables. Soup the consistency of corn huskers lotion. Corn or rice starch. No flavor. At all.\n\nSesame Beef $8.55\n-- Dried out beef. Softened with artificial tenderizer. Smothered in sugar.\n\nBeijing Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs $8.55\n-- Dried out pork chops. Not spare ribs. Fried in oily batter. Drowning in sugar.\n\nBlack mushrooms with snow peas $8.25\n-- Bland. Not fresh. A couple of mushrooms. The rest were fiber-y snow peas.\n\n\nNone of the dishes with prawns had much taste. The prawns tasted bland. Overall, any dish's taste aspects relied mostly on sugar, salt and oil. \n\nOne \"star\". Four \"blehs\".", "author": "The V."}

In particular, the beef noodle soup broth was watery; the noodles also had a strange textural consistency to it, being slightly overcooked and bland. The only saving grace of the meal were the chicken wings and stir-fried string beans. The chicken wings had a nice crunchy texture; which was complimented by the spicy sweet sauce.

Wow... what a disappointment in all facets of the meal.\n\n1) As some of the other reviewers, mentioned the service. We used to be served by this nice, friendly Chinese waiter. Either he was off tonight, or no longer works there? Anyway, the Asian lady who served us provided non-existent service. Some others present (perhaps the delivery people) brought us the cabbage appetizer, she seemed annoyed even when I asked for water. During the meal (needless to say) she never showed up. It must have been because the place was packed (only one other table dining at the time), imagine if they had 4 concurrent tables. \n\n2) The food. we ordered 2 House specialities, the recommended , spicy chicken (YUK), and salt-pepper spare ribs (didn't care for this either). We're used to really, really enjoying our dishes. Either we picked some poor dishes tonight, or perhaps there's new ownership of this restaurant. \n\n3) I recommended to my wife , let's go there tonight, and I've apologized repeatedly all the way home. I like authentic, and great Chinese food, and this place used to be great. Tonight, the green onion pancakes (still good, I admit), and the rice were the best parts of the meal. Truly sad. \n\nIf it's the same ownership, and the waiter was off tonight, I'll let the restaurant message me and tell me this, and perhaps I'll be willing to try again (IF and only IF he would be the one serving me). This was some of the worse service I have experienced, and the food sad to say matched it tonight. \n\nTime to find some new places to go.....", "author": "G L."}

We came here last night & are fans of this place; the owner, Jenny, is very hospitable; making suggestions & getting to know you.  The atmosphere is bare bones, the restaurant a bit smaller than some around, but a wonderful atmosphere.  The spicy won tons are sumptuous with a lite wrapper, seasoned ground pork filling, & a wonderful chili sauce that subtly becomes spicy once you bite into each dumpling.  The green onion pancake is one of the best I have had with layers of dough & onions & perfectly fried.  The general Tsao's chicken is crispy & greasless with tongue tingling hot sauce.  The hunan beef is tender with fresh broccoli, carrots, & zuchini in a wonderful chili paste.  The Beijing string beans are crisp in a wonderful bean sauce.  The bean sauce noodles are to die for with hand pulled noodles, thinly sliced pork, & vegetables in a wonderful bean paste.  Sure, we ordered a little more, but we like having leftovers for the next day.  Note, all of the dumplings, pancakes, & noodles are made in house.  Anything on the menu that says house special is the way to go for anyone not sure; needless to say, it was second nature for me being a Chinese efficianato.  Round it off with a Ching Dao or in my mother's case, some red wine & you will not be disappointed.  The owner loved my limited Mandarin.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-23", "description": "Little Beijing is a favorite of my GF's parents, so I've had a chance to come here many times and try a lot of different dishes.  It's a cute little hole in the wall on Noriega that serves up typical Mandarin dishes.  The food is okay although it's been growing on me.  The first few times we went, the parents had ordered everything for us and you know how that works.  Inevitably there were only like 2 things I really wanted to eat and the rest was, well, bleck.  As of recent, however, I've made more of an effort to be involved in the ordering process and have ordered some dishes that have turned out to be quite delicious.  As a result, I'm eating more and more, and liking Little Beijing more and more, every time we go there.\n\nThey give complimentary peanuts and vinegar soaked cabbage to every table.  I've never seen that at a Chinese restaurant before, so that was interesting.  I'm not a fan of the peanuts however the cabbage is sweet/sour and can get addicting if you're not careful.\n\nThe hot and sour soup doesn't stand out from any other restaurants, however be forewarned that this can sometimes come out unexpectedly extra spicy.   \n\nThe dumplings and fried onion cake are both great ways to start your meal.  The shrimp dumplings are so succulent and ooze with soup when you bite into them.  The fried onion cake is quite tasty as well.  It comes out piping hot and crispy.  I've found it quite tasty to spread the chili sauce from the table all over the onion cake before eating.  We've also ordered the chicken wings a couple times.  While the wings are usually nice and spicy, they don't come close to the wings at San Tung or Marnee Thai.  \n\nFor the entrees, we usually just get a couple noodle dishes.  I can't remember what any of them are called, however none of them are great in terms of flavor.  We seem to always have noodle leftovers. \n\nOne entr\u00e9e that did stand out for me was the orange chicken!  I ordered that for the first time last week after seeing it on another table and it was fabulous.  I know what you must be thinking; I only like this because I'm white, and I probably like the orange chicken at Panda Express too.  LOL, that is so wrong!  Panda orange chicken sucks.  The one they serve at Little Beijing is far superior.  It's drenched in sauce, yet still super crispy.  The meat is all chicken breast, which I greatly appreciate and there are no pieces that are just batter with no meat (something you will find is often the case at Panda).\n\nLittle Beijing is definitely a place to come get your Chinese food fix.  It's not as oily and dirty as other Chinese restaurants and the food tastes pretty good.  I look forward to continuing to eat here many times to come with the family.", "author": "Timothy C."}

The BF and I had cravings for some tasty Chinese-American food, and after trying other places we had gotten pretty jaded. Little Beijing, however, really impressed! \n\nWe each got the lunch special: my bf got the \"General Cho's\" chicken and I got the Szechuan eggplant.  They have about 30 different items to choose from the special, and everything was under $6. Each came with a bowl of white rice and a cup of Hot & Sour soup. The special is available Monday-Friday until 3pm, however it is still available at other times and on weekends but will cost an extra 50 cents. Pretty sweet deal! Especially since the portions were pretty big. The BF and I ended up sharing our dishes, and by the time we were full, we still had enough to take home. Total for the bill was $12. STEAL.\n\nThe chicken made in small, bite-sized pieces that were reeeally crispy and smothered in the slightly spicy brown sauce and succulent garlic chips. It was very flavorful. The eggplant, also served with a spicy brown sauce, was just as delicious. Both items were labeled as spicy on the menu, but they actually weren't spicy that it burned your mouth. \n\nService (just one waitress during lunch today) was friendly and prompt.\n\nI'd LOVE to come back to this place and try their more authentic Beijing dishes, but I think the BF and I have already become instant regulars.", "author": "Trang N."}

I am not very familiar with good Shanghai cuisine but this place will do for the average person not looking for anything extraordinary. \n\nWe ordered a bowl of the sweet soybean milk with crispy flour roll ( dou jiang &  you tiao), green onion \"pancake\", savory sticky rice roll (), beef hand-pulled noodle soup, and dan dan noodles w/sesame paste ().\n\nThe soybean milk is likely pre-made since it came out really fast, followed by the crispy flour roll. The soy milk was decent. Wipe the spoons clean yourself because there was some residue on the upper end from excessive use. Don't forget to stir the sugar at the bottom before serving in smaller bowls. The crispy flour roll is on the worse end since it is too fried that it is as solid as a rock. I like to soften it by dipping it in the soy milk.\n\nThe next dish is the green onion pancake. This is one of the best in the meal as the pancake is not thin like many other places. It is fresh out of the kitchen so it is super crispy and extremely hot when you take a bite. Be careful! Then the savory sticky rice roll came shortly after. I love rice rolls and have since I was a toddler; it's not bad here having been lacking it for months. There is a lot of rice to the roll and a small crispy flour roll which is good. \n\nThe two bowls of noodles came last. The beef hand-pulled noodle was pretty good but I like mine spicy. The noodles are great but the quality of the beef was a bit lower than I expect. There is a good amount of choy in the soup but for some reason the soup smelled like wonton soup even though it clearly tasted beef.\n\nThe dan dan noodles were my least favored entree. My mom expected the soup-style that Hong Kong serves but the one that was served has dry noodles with sesame paste (ma jiang). It's sort of like the infamous zha jiang noodles but with a worse sauce. I would recommend pretty much everything except the dan dan noodles.\n\nI was pretty surprised that it was actually somewhat busy today.

Their not cheap with their napkins though.. so kudos to them for the first asian restaurant that gave my table a \"STACK\" (yes you read right) of napkins! Now onto the food.\n\nThey gave free green onion pancakes... which was alright, but it was just luke warm and there was no dipping sauce. The dipping sauce would have given it the little push to make it really good. They give you free pickled cabbage and peanuts too. The peanuts are marinated and taste pretty good... however one of the peanuts that my brother broke into had a maggot in it... was kind of gross. Can't blame them I guess since it's not like you can was the inside of the shell. We ordered the spinach tofu soup which was pretty good... expected it to be pretty boring but not bad at all. We got the chive and egg pancake as well... that I really didn't care for. Was kind of too wet for me since every bite, some of the juice was leaking out... and it was kind of bland. Got the lettuce wrap with chicken... it was decent but they should shake the water off the lettuce more since water was literally dripping down my arm with every bite... but I guess that shows that they at least rinsed it clean... so oh well? We also ordered the hunan chicken, some vegetable dish with sugar snap peas, and a beef dish that I forgot. Nothing really stood out to me but nothing was disgusting either.

As we SF residents know all too well, there is the best AND the worst Chinese in San Francisco so I am always skeptical of trying new places without a recommendation or a Yelp review pointing me in the right direction. Once we sat down we watched 3 other Chinese families be seated and served before us. I don't want to mention the weighted term racist, but if you are not asian, some places in asian districts do tend to treat you differently. After 20 minutes we finally were able to give our orders. Everything except the crab cakes and the soup was very mediocre if not less than average. The chow mein was terrible. The crab cakes, however, were some of the best I have ever had!

The fare here is not all Northern Chinese, but rather more of a hodge podge of various cuisines from around the \"Middle Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThey also have their own take on \"Americanized\" Chinese food such as General Chao's chicken and Mongolian beef, and do quite a great job with it. For those who crave something more authentic, they have practically everything covered. There is nothing rare or unique - just your basic dishes you can find anywhere else - but the chefs here tend not to use too much sauce or salt, so you don't feel all bloated when you are finished.\r\n\r\nUnlike many establishments in the Sunset, non-Chinese are welcome here as far as I can see. Obviously, I wouldn't know first hand, but from my observation, the staff here treats everyone as equals. Also, typical of Chinese restaurants, there is a \"secret\" menu written in Chinese on the wall, but if you do not understand, the waiter will be glad to translate for you, instead of telling you that  \"You wouldn't like it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a high class restaurant, nor does it try to be.

My friend said the shrimp had no taste, not even a seasoning. The onion pancakes were good though. I didn't like how they charged extra for rice. Most Chinese restaurants already give you rice with your dish.\nThe service here only added to the horrible experience. It was terrible. Yes, the lady is a *****. She seemed to treat regulars nice while she completely ignored the others. There was one instance where she tossed a dirty rag onto the table next to us, right over my head, and it almost nailed me. No tip for her. The waiter didn't seem to know who ordered what and had to continuously ask the lady for help. I ordered a Coke and it never came to me until after I asked them about it.\nDo you have free time to kill or like waiting in restaurants? This place is perfect for you. It took them about 40 minutes to get our order and then serve us our order. A family who came in a little after us got up and left because they were sitting there for 20 minutes without any service. Some guy PICKING UP his food-to-go was waiting ten minutes until someone finally helped him.\nI think I know why this place is empty most of the time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-21", "description": "This place is a rare find in SF, where most of the Chinese fare could be described as greasy spoon Cantonese. This is also a simple family style hole in the wall, but it is Beijing style. The flavors, I am told by Chinese friends, are spot on authentic. Everyone suggests the green onion pancakes, but I would suggest going with the shrimp ones instead. They are flakier and tastier. The noodle dishes, on a good day, are excellent, just like many favorite Mandarin eateries on the Penninsula (which are actually as a whole, better than those in SF--perhaps because this is where larger immigrant communities live?), and compares to casual eateries in Beijing. Skip this place if you are there at peak hours. The quality noticeably goes down.", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

But generally speaking it is a pretty good restaurant if you like spicy and Northern Chinese food.\n\nBUT! I have to say the owner(manager) is kinda rude. She got cranky to her staff some times and showed less patience with costumers. Since she is also Chinese so I just ate it up and didn't say anything. But not matter with which standard, American or Chinese, she is rude sometimes.\n\nSo if you only want to enjoy food there, it's definitely a great place to go, you won't be disappointed. But you might also \"enjoy\" the manager's bad manners if your unlucky...  \n\nHope this review is helpful.", "author": "Sophie Y."}

I actually prefer the take out option, as the dine in service can be somewhat lacking. The price is right and the delivery time is pretty decent.", "author": "Steve M."}

Most waitress/waiters will fill your tea when empty, give you a new plate when your's is full, bring more napkins, rice, or any other standard necessities!\nAfter giving the place a second chance, I have to say the food is pasable, the service and attitude will turn your stomach.", "author": "Patrick G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-08", "description": "The place is a jewel.  They do everything well, not just their fabulous green onion pancakes!  I favor their Generals Chicken, homemade soups, and handmade noodles over many other places.  The polite old-fashioned gentleness of the wait staff, and the ease in which they interact, would be enough to bring you back.  Prices are comfortable, so just order to your heart's content like I do. Place is clean, but the focus is on the cooking, not the decor.  Patronized by locals, young, old, families. Like I said, it's a jewel.", "author": "Judy A."}

This one is probably one of the best. Excellent food. The green onion pancakes are great. So is the eggplant. It's a small place, so maybe nicer to just get it to go.", "author": "N L."}

I learned to use chopsticks quickly although like a good American I naturally gravitate towards a utensil that enables me to shove as much food as possible into my mouth at one given time. Chopsticks are a good thing. I should say that there is a touch of nostalgia encapsulating this review because I spent my high school days living on 21st and Moraga and have eaten at Little Beijing for more than a decade. Their consistency has amazed me. I'm surprised by the not so positive reviews. I do always order the same dishes though so maybe I'm missing out on something. Here's what they do better than anyplace I have found yet: Green Onion Pancakes (when you eat in the restaurant look around, you will most likely see it on everybody's table), Beef  with Broccoli (best flavor! nice cuts of beef! not all chewy or stringy or otherwise frightening!), I love to pour the sauce over my rice....mmmmm, General Tsou's Chicken is the best I have ever had--theirs is what sold me on the dish in the first place (although I haven't tried it at every single place in the city--let me know if someone thinks there is a better one) and my Mom who is a little more adventurous than I am always likes whatever weird thing she orders. I'm sorry I can't think of any of her favorite dishes right now. I guess I'm kind of about 'me' when I go out to dinner with my Mom. Oh Little Beijing, why won't you deliver all the way across the city to me? You're mean. But you know I'll get my ass on a 71 Noriega bus one of these days and come crawling back to you. I think I'll have to transfer though. Ugh.", "author": "Magi C."}
