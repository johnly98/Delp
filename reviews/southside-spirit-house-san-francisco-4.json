So, after some research, I rounded up a group of friends to do Tuesday trivia at Southside.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I decided to come at 7 pm for the 8 pm trivia, in order to ensure we got a table. However, it didn't seem to be a big problem. When trivia started, there was only 5 teams, and the bar itself wasn't too packed.\n\nFor drinks, I really enjoyed the Hookers Boot and Smoked Oaxacan Neogrini (although beware that it most definitely tastes like smoke!). In general, I appreciated how the drinks here tended more towards smoky than sweet, and at around $13 each were reasonably priced for quality.\n\nSo... How was trivia, you ask? It was a lot of fun, even though we completely sucked! Even coming in last, the game was good and the atmosphere upbeat. Trivia or not, Southside is definitely a place to check out.", "author": "Angela C."}

They have jenga on some of the tables which can be a nice little group activity for people who can't hold a conversation otherwise.\n\nIt is a little weird that the guy checking IDs always interrogates you about whether you have knives or water(?) - so I guess make sure you pre-hydrate?", "author": "Joe B."}

The space is really great, the finger foods are very tasty and the cocktails are delicious. On top of that, the beer selection here is top notch as well and from what I can tell, they often rotate a few taps bringing in new seasonal beers.\n\nYou can reserve some spaces I believe, otherwise there a big bar, communal high top seats and some lounge seating. There's sort of half outdoor patio, and the bartenders are pleasant peeps. Foodwise, the shishito peppers, truffle tater tots, and chicken fingers are all great choices. I've had a number of the whiskey cocktails including this spicey one they had on special one night, I think it was called the diablo and it was sort of a take on a whiskey sour I think (or maybe more like an old fashioned), but damn, it was so, so good.\n\nWhen it's busy, you're just going to have to wait sometimes for the drinks. Any good cocktail bar cannot just spew out drinks left and right when they're making them from scratch. My only complaint is that they have all these tables, but you have to order everything from the bar. Seems like a waiter or 2 would go a long way in efficiency, at least for the bartenders to take in food/drink orders. 4.5 half stars so far...something I really, really wish we could give on Yelp...1/2 stars...oh well.

It was around 9/10PM and we were looking for a spot that had a kitchen open past 10PM. Yelp told us to come here. I called and the person who answered the phone said that the kitchen closes at 1AM! Heck yes.\n\nThe food menu was pretty small, but we already had a few drinks, and I knew that the truffle tater tots and margherita pizza were calling my name. Everything tasted great, and the flavors were fantastic. However, I think the only thing needing improvement would be the bread-stick-hard quality of the pizza dough. The crust was not fresh-tasting, even though the burrata and cherry tomatoes used were delicious and perfect. Just change the crust quality, and everything will be amazing.\n\nI love the ambiance of the place. There are loungey short tables as well as taller bar tables and bar seating too, so it's perfect for small groups, date night, or larger parties looking for a fun night. We enjoyed people watching. The vibes are dimly lit and on the sexier side for a bar--without being on the opposite ends of the spectrum of obnoxiously stuck-up or dingy. I would totally come back again and try their whiskey selection. I didn't order any drinks this night, but boo got a beer on tap.", "author": "Jodi H."}

Granted it was busy and very loud inside the bar, the fact that it took 10 minutes to order some tater tots and another 20 to actually get them after following up with 2 different people about the order was a bit confusing. \n\nDrinks: Moderate craft beer selection. Wine and cocktails available too. \nHappy Hour: 3-7PM (M-F), $1 off beer and wine. \nFood: Garlic tater tots were tasty.\nPrice: Pretty good.

There's lots of room to stand around, though, with a decent amount of elbow room. \n\nThis place is relatively new to the area (located where Eve used to be - their gold-embossed entryway serves as a little reminder), but they've made fantastic use of the space. Borrowing from the naturally-lit, open-air, trendy-but-rustic-but-priced-more-on-the-trendy-side developments in SOMA in the past couple years, Southside fits right in. They've got a solid list of house cocktails, beers on draft, and shareable snackables like flatbreads, fries, and tots. \n\nI went with a $6 beer (which may be a $1 off during HH? not positive) and snagged a few flatbread slices from a buddy. Both were great! The vibe is chatty and friendly without getting too loud, and the skylight adds a relaxed glow to the space, which is decked out with original artwork and wooden detailing.\n\nFalling somewhere between a chic bar and a lodge, Southside is a solid spot to grab a couple drinks and catch up with folks. We only stuck around for about an hour, but if you grab a table near the bar you could easily pass an evening here. \n\nIt's hard to compete with the Tuesday Happy Hour at Kate's right next door, but on another weeknight I'd happily return.

My friend was waiting for me at the bar, which I'm thankful for, because it was fairly crowded for a Wednesday after-work happy hour.\n\nThe bartenders are so sweet. When I took bartending classes, I'm glad that my instructor emphasized the importance of etiquette to their patrons. Any bartender who takes the time to say \"I'll be right with you.\" even if I'm not in a rush, deserves praise and a slightly bigger tip. Over the course of our stay, I ordered the Toki Koki and the Resurrection cocktails. So good! Perfectly strong and well-crafted. The Toki Koki was a strong scotch drink, while the Resurrection was a fruity vodka drink. Either way, this place definitely earns an A+ for its cocktails.\n\nAs for food, there's a limited menu, but it's way more fulfilling than plain bar food. I ordered chicken tenders, which came with a delicious BBQ sauce. The other sauce, which was my only complaint, was disgustingly watery. It tasted like someone forgot to shake the bottle of Ranch dressing. I should have asked for another batch. The chicken itself was very tender and tasty, not dry and overfried like most chicken tenders served at a bar.\n\nIn my mind, I saved the best FiDi bar for last.

A table opened up so we moved closer, and it was still so hard to hear. I would recommend for them to put up a temp wall to separate the space just for trivia night to fix this issue.\n3. The last 2 rounds, music & celebrity identification, are the best rounds! You don't have to worry about not hearing the speaker.\n4. I don't like their grading policy.

Naturally I thought that it would be a good place to have my coworker's birthday celebration.  After work, on a Monday, I figured that it shouldn't be that full or crowded and that we can find seating easily.  Also, if we ordered food, then it shouldn't take that long for us to get it.\n\nGetting here at 5pm, it wasn't full at all and we got seats easily.  From their list of draft beers, half of them were not available for some odd reason.  That was slightly irritating as I wanted one of those beers that they were out of.  I had to settle for one that they did have.\n\nWe ordered food, a pizza and a lot of tater tots and a salad.  The pizza took a long time...way too long if you ask me.  How hard is it to put cheese and stuff on a pizza?  The tater tots came out but again, way too long for a place that wasn't too busy.  As for the salad?  It never came...we asked the server who was running food and he said that they don't have a salad order pending.  What?  After getting one of the bartender's attention, they immediately said that they would refund the charge including the tip that we left.  OK...great...but how about an explanation and an apology?  Never got either one.  It also didn't help that the food runner had an attitude as well, not being helpful or accommodating when we were asking about our yet to be delivered food.\n\nIt seems almost laughable that these amateur hour type of things happen in such a seasoned business as Southside.  Sure they can still make a good cocktail and they have very comfortable and wide open seating, but the customer service experience that we had was well below average.  If this happens on a slow Monday night, then why should I ever trust that this place runs any better on nights with way more customer traffic?\n\nI definitely owe my coworker an apology for choosing to go to such an unworthy place for celebrating his birthday.", "author": "Ben H L."}

Greg and I passed by here on our way to Thirsty Bear from our home and saw a sign out in front that said \"Soup of the Day: Whiskey\".  Anyway, we stopped in for a few cocktails and saw that when you order two cocktails on their menu, you get a free pizza!!  FREE PIZZA after ordering two drinks?!?!? ummmm this obviously makes so much sense.  I had the Maiden Lane and my friend had the Gold Rush cocktail.  Mine was served in a mason jar and was definitely pretty potent and strong.  The Gold Rush is served up, and comes garnished with black pepper.  We ordered the Mission Pizza that came with mushrooms and cheese.  All of this makes so much sense, except when it came down to the service.  We had asked the bartender who took our order for drinks if the note on the botton of the menu was true, where getting two cocktails meant a free pizza.  He said yeah, but his reaction was like \"UGH. I mean, yeah I GUESS that means you get this.\"  So, even after saying yes, there was no indication on what/how we order said pizza and we were left sort of guessing about what was next.  We flagged down the second bartender and asked the same question, got a similar response that resembled rolled eyes and heavy sighs, but was pointed to the back of the menu where we could choose which pizza we wanted.  Ultimately we ordered it, it came out, it was actually pretty delicious, and reasonably sized for two people to share.  Naturally our friends caught on to the idea and before you know it, Southside had to pump out 3 more pizzas for our group of friends.  My thoughts on the whole thing: Don't get mad about something that's on your menu, bro.  The most awesome thing here is their cassette tape wall.  Super hipster, but so cool at the same time.\n\nSo, the main takeaway here is that the whole idea of this place is good.  The cocktails are priced for SOMA/FiDi, and this free pizza incentive is amazing.  That being said, the attitude of the bartenders here really need to change.  We might be back if we're i the area and in the mood for cocktails + pizza.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I also was recommended to try the \"Grey Hound\" because the citrus fruits are fresh and in season. That was definitely a great drink to have, too.

Huh. \n\nThis place is HELLA loud, and REALLY crowded. I guess it was also a Friday night, so maybe that added to the extra crowdedness of the place. I LOVE that they had the Giants game on, which made it a little less \"after work\" and a little more \"San Francisco.\"\n\nDrinks here are pretty strong, and decent. I was swayed by their White Manhattan, and HOLY VODKA batman! This thing was like Vodka on ice, with a splash of bitters. \n\nIn the midst of our drinking, my friends (ok, really me) was tempted by their pork belly sliders...so I ordered one. The flavor of it was pretty good, but I wish they seared the belly fat a little longer. I got more mushy lard than that delicious crisp that you can get with belly meat. It came with some pickled veg, which really helped cut the fat. \n\nOverall, I like this place. They had random games (Would You Rather, Jenga, etc) on the tables for fun.

Due to circumstances I've actually wound up here twice in the last week, and both times the new bartenders were snappy and rude. The first time I came in and tried to order the Dia De Los Muertos- they were out of guava. Then i asked the bartender if he could still make the Hooker's boot (see previous review), and his response was : \"I'm new here so I have no idea how to make that.\" Ooookkaaayyy, can you ask someone? I'm pretty sure I'm not the first/ last person to ask for this drink, and as a former bartender I would have offered to try to replicate it or ask the patron what kind of drink they like. Honestly these SOMA bartenders parade around like mixologists, but a true mixologist would be able to make any drink, on the fly, or invent something equally delicious to make someone happy. Frustrated, I asked for a Trumer...they were out. Finally I got a Kellerwies from Sierra Nevada. At this point my co-worker chimes in and makes a comment about the beer and mr. salty bartender asks if he's tried it. Co worker starts to reply he is from Chico and MSB replies \"what is that supposed to mean?\" Um, Sierra Nevada is from Chico bro.\n\nFast- forward to last night. Company happy hour. Our group arrives and someone who was assigned to be our server comes up, introduces himself, and says we can order from him or at the bar. I decide to order at the bar and as soon as I get my drink another salty bartender rudely snaps \"you know you have a server, right?\" From that point on I ordered from our server (who was really nice btw).\n\nI know I'm not alone in this feeling since others remarked they also had salty experiences here.

It was chill, pleasantly populated and the sun was shining in through the open windows. We ordered cocktails (happy hour 'til 7) and got a free pizza to go along with them (free pizza with two signature cocktails on Saturdays). \n\nThe drinks were excellently made. I despise sweet drinks, so I stay away from most cocktails with fruit in them. My friend got a strawberry cocktail and I had a sip, and I have to say it was sublime. It was like tasting childhood afternoons by the beach (I'm from Hawaii). The fruit flavor was excellent and it was not at all sugary.\n\nOf course, I rather liked my whiskey drink.\n\nPours were huge. They use those Champagne coups I love, however the ones they use are nearly double the size of the ones at Tradition and Rickhouse. And they're filled up nicely.\n\nThe mezcal Negroni was substantial.\n\nOnto the pizza, we ordered the one with squash flowers and burrata. It was large; enough for two. The bartender even asked if we wanted another, since we ordered four drinks. We said no, because we were full, but I suspect that is somewhat unforgivable of us.\n\nAnyway, Southside Spirit House (on a mellow night) has won my heart.

It's cool atmosphere brings in the crowds by 5pm for happy hour. It echos of people having a great time. They also have music playing starting around 7pm which makes it even louder. I came here with a large group of about 15 people and it was so difficult to converse among my peeps from across our table. I guess I wouldn't mind such a loud atmosphere if I had been expecting it and it was later in the night. I had not been here before and didn't realize it's not really that great for large groups that want to actually talk to each other. \n\nThese specialty drinks were soo good and the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. I had emailed to reserve a table 2 days before and they hooked us up with a very nice, lounge-y table - plenty of seating for a large crowd. I even got a personalized reserved seating label for...\"Chanelle.\" Oh yeah, that's me -Pretty fancy, huh? They even let us pay and/or open a tab individually instead of one large tab. They really go out of their way to ensure you have a great time. Happy hour means you get $1 off your drink. They also have a late night happy hour. \n\nI had saw someone walking around with a copper mug and immediately thought \"Moscow Mule.\" Well, I wanted to have a cool copper mug too so I ordered one for myself. Needless to say it didn't come with the cool mug. Apparently people steal them so if you want the cool cup with your drink (not to take home), you must front your ID at the bar as collateral (which of course I was game for). \n\nTheir food menu is pretty amazing. Our waitress recommended a margherita flat bread which is not on the menu and it was probably the best thing That Should Be on the menu. \n\nI'm not sure how often this happens but there was a new, local vodka company promoting their product by giving out free vodka shots (Seven Still of SF). Who can pass that up? Really cool if they promote local companies like that. \n\nLastly, I could not find this place at first so if you are planning an outing here, it's right next to Kate O'Brien's on Howard at 2nd.", "author": "Chanelle N."}

As an \"eat this so I don't get too tipsy too fast\" substance it's fine - but I wouldn't say it's overly enjoyable to eat. The Mission pizza lacked the truffle flavor we all expected (but was heavy on the onion) and the Twin Peaks left everyone -whelmed. Not over, not under, just whelmed.

From the moment we sat down at the bar, the bartender was cold.  No smile, no water to start us off.  Just working to pay the bills it seemed.  We ordered the Vieux Kenner, the Ramble On, a Happy Hippie pizza, and pork sliders.  When our pizza arrived sans squash blossoms I was devastated because that was my sole purpose for ordering it in the first place!  (I would've ordered a carnivorous pizza otherwise!)  I inquired about the squash blossoms and the chef was like, \"I'm sorry, we ran out!  The bartender should have told you when you ordered!\"  Figures.  Later on I wanted an Old Fashioned and asked the bartender if their specialty Autumn Old Fashioned made with maple syrup was sweeter than the classic because I dislike sweet drinks.  Her answer?  \"I don't know.\"  No attempt at an explanation whatsoever.  I'm sorry Missy, but it ain't unreasonable to expect you to understand the ingredients your mixing and if you work in the service industry, it's your job to provide some service!    \n\nIt's really too bad, because the rest of the service was excellent - the chef, the busboy, the male bartender were all great.  The male bartender even offered me a free drink for the lack of squash blossoms on my pizza.  \n\nNow finally onto the food and drink.  My Vieux Kenner and Autumn Old Fashioned were both not sweet and overall acceptable, but not complex in flavor.  The Vieux Kenner was light on the Fernet and therefore not very licorice-y, while the maple did not shine through in the Autumn Old Fashioned.  The Ramble on was loaded with muddled blueberries but was otherwise too sweet for my taste -- but it certainly was an excellent girly drink.  The squash blossom-less not so Happy Hippie was topped with fresh, flavorful shrooms and the flatbread crust was excellently crisp and seasoned with parmesan.  Bottom line, the food and drink are all pretty decent, especially for a bar!  In the future if I'm going to spend $11 on a cocktail I'll take my money to the Alembic or one of the B&B bars, but if it's Saturday and I get a free pizza with my drink purchase, I'll be back to revisit Southside Spirit House.

On top of beers, I tried the Vieux Kinner (Rye, Cognac, Fernet, Vermouth) which I enjoyed a lot. I tasted some of the other cocktails ordered by friends and those were pretty good as well. \n\nThe bartenders and staff were very friendly and responsive. One of the staff was especially helpful and attentive. After some chatting, we found out he was the owner, Colin, just filling in for the night. He is a cool dude - he let us know about the various specials and when there was a mix-up that delayed a couple of our drinks, he comped those drinks. The greatest revelation of the night is that on Saturdays, if you order two cocktails, you get a free pizza. Mind explosion. My memory is a little foggy about which ones we got (one was prosciutto and fig), but they were tasty.\n\n Will definitely be back in some capacity. They have a happy hour with $1 off drinks and a late night Spirit Hour with $2 off spirits / $1 off beer and wine. Southside also has TV's, so it could be a good place to catch a game. \n\nP.S. for the the people commenting on the $13 beer, you probably ordered Hitachino which retails for about $6 for a small bottle. With regular bar markup, $13 is about right.", "author": "Brian C."}

Off the top, I'm pretty impressed with this place.\n\nWe all ordered various cocktails and beer and passed it around to taste.  The drink I selected, the \"Ramble On,\" was definitely a home run.  (Gin, fresh lime, house made blueberry basil syrup).  Frankly, I could drink it for days.\n\nTo our surprise, there was a Saturday night special where you received a free (whole) pizza with every two cocktails you ordered.  These pizzas are sizable (somewhere between a small and a medium size, 8 slices).  They're also tasty, but there was something missing that I couldn't really put my finger on.  I could see how other reviewers have dinged them on their pizza.  But then again, I don't hold it against them as SSH is not really a pizza place.\n\nLastly, just a heads up, Saturday night is dead at SSH.  Its a great place to go if you want to sit and chat with food.  But if you're looking for a party, go somewhere else.  This place seems more suited as an after-work happy hour bar/restaurant.\n\nBottom line, as long as you view SSH from the perspective of a nice place to get drinks, have a seat, chat with friends, and munch on a few things to fill your stomach, you'll have a great time.  If you're looking for the next Pizzeria Delfina, go somewhere else.", "author": "Bobby L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-16", "description": "My rating is four stars but I see Southside becoming a five-star bar soon. \n\nGreat drink menu at Southside. The prices for beer and wine are surprisingly reasonable. The draft beer list is full of glasses at either $5 or $6. Only one is at $13, if memory serves. Most glasses of wine in single digits as well. \n\nThe layout is nice, offering plenty of room for multiple groups, and yet it doesn't feel too big just for a twosome. A few TVs are placed strategically around the bar. Plenty of Warriors fans (yes, this is another Bay Area bandwagon time of year, though hopefully one of the folks will be wearing her own Sharks jersey - respeck!) cheering on the Dubs. \n\nVieux (spelled viex on the menu) Kenner is a steal at $11 because it tastes good, of course, and packs a punch; it's all alcohol. Get it neat rather than on a big block to taste it chilled and not too cold. You want some flavor to come through.\n\nClosing out the tab wasn't easy if not done immediately when receiving the drinks. Anyway, you may need to speak up, way up, at the bar to get your bartender's attention even if Southside doesn't appear busy. My habit of putting down a credit card only if ordering multiple rounds works against me here. When just buying one round, I pay with cash, unless it's work T&E.

Comes equipped with alcohol & seating!!\n- Reasonably priced drinks.\n- DJ & room for dancing (although you won't want to).\n\nCons:\n- You might die if you drink here. \n- $20 card minimum (3 drinks). \n\nWalked in here at 1:00 am yesterday, on Friday night, for a final drink of  the evening because it was close to the Marriott where I was staying.  \n\nThe venue itself has potential to not suck - there was a mediocre DJ playing, an area for dancing, ample seating + booth seating good for groups toward the back, and an impressive array of liquor behind the bar.  Not surprisingly though, the place was relatively dead (especially for a Friday night) and the people who were there effectively accomplished giving the place a weird, old-dude vibe.  Not feeling it. \n\nThe purpose of this review was to lament the appalling and abhorrently irresponsible service I received at the end of the night. Come 1:40 am, the lights lifted and the staff began their efforts to round everyone up. We had already purchased 2 drinks for $14 but needed to order a final drink to meet the $20 minimum requirement.  I asked for a Screwdriver, thinking it would be a drink that we could easily share and consume quickly. The bartender informs me that she can't serve me a mixed drink, but offers a shot instead (I assumed this was due to a time consideration - they were trying to get people out after all). So, I ask for an oj back with my shot. I'm told I can't have juice, as it's been put away (under the bar where it always is? Perhaps you should keep out the items needed to service your customers while you're still open...), but I'm offered a soda back and I concede. This woman is in such an all-fired rush to get people out so that she can get off at 2 o'clock on the dot that she negligently hands me a glass of coke that is hot, un-rinsed, and full of chemical sanitizer.

A bar should not serve food if if can't actually deliver.\n\nWe arrived at 9:40pm on a Friday night to kill an hour and change before a movie at the Metreon. The good- nice ambiance, busy but not crowded. A fantastic long ceiling/wall mirror lets you people-watch discreetly without being creepy. \n\nUnfortunately the good stops there. The drink we ordered (Hooker's Boot) tries to be everything at once- sweet, smoky, spicy- and ends up being too much and as subtle as, well, a boot to the face. For the price there are much better drinks in the city.\n\nThe worst is that we almost didn't get our food. We ordered sliders at 9:55pm. At 10:45pm, the sliders still have not arrived and we need to go to watch our movie.

They also did a good job of keeping people arriving for another party to stay in their section (they had a bigger crowd than my group).  That's not an easy thing to do.\n\nDuring the event, the food came out piping hot throughout the first half of our 3 hour event. Late comers didn't have to settle for cold food.  All the food was delicious!!!  I had been here before just for drinks and thought the food other people ordered looked great.  So I was relying on my \"foodie\" instincts and hoped the food would taste as good as they sounded.  Flat bread doesn't sound like fancy party food, but SSH made them with upscale ingredients that are super tasty and elevated them to party food status.  Our waitress was \"on it\" when getting everyone's drinks.  When I checked with a new arrival about flagging our waitress to take their order, she had already gotten it!\n\nGreat food, great drinks, great space, great staff = great party, even for the hostess!!!", "author": "Lisa T."}

They did a good job with the interior but it's the bad attitude of the staff, the lame happy hour crowd, and the pizza that tasted like cardboard that has me never wanting to come back. Drinks are also mediocre at best.", "author": "Aman V."}

It's great for big groups (make reservations), not too crowded and the staff was attentive.  Although, other Yelpers complaint about the noise, it wasn't loud at all, but I guess it depends on the night and if there's an event.  A plus was the free pizza with every two special cocktails ordered on Saturday nights and Jenga which was fun to play. \nWill defiantly come back to this place..", "author": "Rachelle B."}

Hipster bartender refused to turn even 1 TV to Sharks game 7 last night saying they had elected to be only NBA that day.  Mind you nobody watching the TVs and no Bay Area teams on.   We had brought 10 people and stayed for 3 hours so I'm surprised at the lack of customer service.", "author": "Mike W."}
