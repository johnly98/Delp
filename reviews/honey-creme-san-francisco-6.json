I came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm. There were only a few seats, but it was empty so there was no problem getting a spot to sit. We asked what flavors she recommended and she told us the most popular was the honey or the honeycomb. \n\nWe got the honeycomb ($4.75) and added boba ($0.50). Honestly, it was kind of underwhelming. The ice cream was creamy, but had no flavor whatsoever, unless paired with the honeycomb. There was only one chunk of honeycomb so it was hard to spread it with the rest of the ice cream. I wish they layered honey in it (though I guess that's why they have the honey flavor you could pick). It melted pretty quickly (but I guess that's understandable with soft serve). The boba was good and soft, so I would definitely get that as a topping again. Also, a bit pricey for the size of the dessert. \n\nI would be open to giving this place another try if I was in the area, but I would probably get a more flavorful option, like Chocolate or Oreo.", "author": "April L."}

The interior has limited seating but it's clean and bright and features a large, easy to read menu highlighting their signature soft serve options and their flavored ice cream cone choices.  Our order:\n\nHoneycomb Ice Cream - $4.50. it's a beautiful dessert with luscious swirls of milk soft serve mixed with ribbons of honey and a very nice and impressive cube of real honey comb on top.  Flavors are delicious and it's easy to see why this shop has the hype behind it.  The soft serve isn't too sweet and the honey matches very well with everything tasting fresh, organic and high quality.   Several other patrons tried the cotton candy version and it's also impressive and great for sharing.  \n\nIf there's one caveat, it's that the close-up photos all make the desserts look larger than they are in real life.  You really don't have a good reference in the store but if you can see their cone selection, you notice how petite the desserts are and the cup choices are similar in size. \n\nOverall, even with the smaller than expected size, I loved the flavors and thought it worth the cost.  I look forward to Honey Creme's continued expansion and will look out for a Peninsula location if they have that in their future. \n\nHoney Creme accepts credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

I recently tried the honey milk tea and that was pretty bomb too. I appreciate how the tea flavor is still apparent in all drinks they make.\n\nOne of the unique things about Honey Creme is their soft serve ice cream. The earl grey with boba is PERFECTION.

The thing that makes Honeymee is delicious is the flavor of the soft serve combined with the great tasting honey (and honeycomb).  \n\nThe flavor of the ice cream was lackluster, making us question why we were paying $4.50 for McDonald's level ice cream.  Also, it's an extra $1 for the honeycomb.

I'm the kind of person who desperately craves soft serve ice cream, so I stopped by to get some one night. I think the soft serve itself doesn't really have much flavor and it leaves a bit of a weird aftertaste. Also, the portion is super small for the price you pay. I did however think the mango slush with lychee jelly that my boyfriend got was quite good! So, I'd probably go back for the slush but it's definitely not one of my go-to places.", "author": "Claire C."}

I am a huge fan of soft serve so I've been excited to try this place for a while now and I'm so happy to say it did not disappoint. The soft serve is so rich and creamy without being too sweet and the addition of the honey compliments the soft serve perfectly. I got the cereal milk so mine was topped with some type of cereal that tasted like a mix of Frosted Flakes and some kind of cinnamon granola...not sure what it was but it was bomb af! Very much looking forward to trying other toppings as flavor combos!\n\nI'd say the only downside is that it's kinda pricy for the amount of soft serve that you get but I don't mind that too much.", "author": "Paige M."}

I happened to be on Irving St. for dinner, and spotted Honey Creme while walking up and down the street waiting for San Tung wings. \n\nFirst impression: I was immediately drawn in by the minimalistic decor--everything was very neutral with white and wooden walls, which I appreciated. They also had a super cute rotating rainbow ice cream cone display which made for aesthetically pleasing pictures! I also was impressed with how many items were on the menu. I'm a regular at Milkcow in Fremont, which only has about 10 different topping combinations as compared to Honey Creme, which had many more. The store itself is pretty small with only one bench and no tables, so it's not really a good place to hang around with friends.\n\nWhat I Ordered:\n\nCereal Milk: (3/5) It was okay...definitely not bad, but not noteworthy or anything. It definitely looked better than it tasted, unfortunately. The ice cream was not very sweet, which is usually a good thing for me, but it didn't taste like anything at all which was frustrating. It also melted remarkably fast! The cereal on top was a nice touch, but didn't add enough flavor to the ice cream itself. \n\nService: They took my order quickly and promptly, and I didn't wait longer than 2 minutes for my dessert, which is definitely appreciated :)\n\nOverall, it's a cute, reliable dessert place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.", "author": "Stephanie N."}

I went with the honeycomb soft serve and they had a special flavor of the month: milk tea. This is my first time but, I had soft serve(original flavor) at MilkCow before so I wanted another flavor. The milk tea flavor is pretty good at first, but the more I eat, the less appealing it was. It definitely tastes good with the honeycomb was it was also really waxy where it left little bits in my teeth(weird hmm). Once the honeycomb is gone, the soft serve is okay afterwards. The cup may look small, but 8oz of soft serve is a lot, easily shared with one or maybe even two others. Honey Creme is an alright place, I'd come back if I was craving soft serve. You get to take Instagrammable pics so I guess you can say it's worth it!\n\nINSIDE:\nThere is a long bench right next to the window display so you can sit and enjoy your soft serve.

Ice cream are made with fresh organic milk with cream and the honey comb is sourced from US bee farms. Not much flavor in the ice cream but they don't use artificial sugar which is a good thing. The honey comb is sweet which puts the sweet into the ice cream if you take a small scoop of honey comb and combine it with a scoop of ice cream and eat it like that! My biggest thing with this shop is their \"Hollow middle\". The ice cream itself is in a small cup already combined with a hollow middle, there isn't much ice cream you are getting. I told them about the \"hollow middle\" and they said that's how the machine makes the ice cream when it comes out into the cups.

This is basically the original frozen yogurt with honey drizzle. The honey added a nice touch, but the frozen yogurt literally had no taste whatsoever.

It's pretty similar to Milk Cow in Fremont. It was a cold day so there wasn't anyone in the store so no line. The cashier was really nice and presented me with a menu when I walked in.  I wanted the honey comb but I also wanted some chocolate syrup so the ice cream wouldn't be so bland because I felt if I just got the honey comb it wouldn't be enough for all the ice cream in the cup.\n\nI got the chocolate syrup with a honey comb (To add a honey comb to your ice cream it's an extra $1)  So I paid $5 for a small cup of ice cream which was pretty expensive. The honey comb itself is good and is filled with honey but the only problem is you have to spit out the wax every time you bite into it. I think the soft serve could have had more flavor in it.  It was tasteless to me without the honey or the chocolate. \n\nOverall this place is just okay but if you're in the area and never tried honey with your ice cream I would say to check it out.", "author": "Sherry L."}

I am a huge honey fan, so I ordered the mixed grains and regular honey comb flavor. \n\nThe mixed grains has a lot of honey and texture to it so I highly suggest getting this. Their honey combs are good but have a waxy after taste! It's also an extra dollar to add a honey comb to your order of it doesn't come with it already. Compared to other dessert places, their Creme is very light and you can make it sweet by ordering the popcorn, coffee, or other flavors with it. If you order something more simple, you'll be left with just vanilla ice cream. So I suggest getting whatever has the most honey and toppings to treat yourself!!!", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

I'm also comparing this place to Milk Cow in Fremont, which I think has better quality soft served ice cream and is cheaper. The ice cream at Honey Cream,to me, is reminiscent of McDonald's soft serve. It lacks depth and I wouldn't really say it's milky. The toppings, like honey and cotton candy, makes up for it, slightly. I also find this expensive as they give you a small cup for $5+ dollars. At Milk Cow, for that price you can get a large cup of creamy goodness. \n\nThis shop is pretty small and it has no seating. People end up sitting on the window sill or standing in the middle of the floor. As people kept coming in, my friend and I resorted to standing outside in the cold, with our cold desert.\n\nSince Honey Creme is the first of its kind in the area, I think it's an OK spot to hit up if you're in the mood.

Honey Creme satisfies my preferences, as their soft serve is deliciously more milky than sweet, well balanced between creamy and light, and notably photogenic.  \n\nI tried the Mixed Grains, consisting of a caramel drizzle and mixed grains that I couldn't quite identify. (In any case, I can fool myself into being guilt-free for eating something called mixed grains). As many Yelpers have pointed out, there is a hollow core but I found it insignificant since the soft serve is piled so high to a decent overall portion size. The main issue I found was the heterogenity of the toppings: most of the topping/sauce was on the top and the bottom, leaving the middle largely plain. I suggest mixing it well to avoid leaving disgruntled over plain-tasting ice cream.\n\nPrices are standard for dessert in SF, at $4.75 for a cup with topping and $5.50 for cone, and they even have a stamp card! (This is the city where $4 gets you a piece of toast or a cup of pour-over coffee.) I think I'll be sticking with the cups because I don't see anything too special about the cones, besides the colorfulness and the whimsical cone boquet decor. Along the same vein, their whole shop is clean and modern, with lots of good backgrounds for Instagrams.\n\nI will be back to try the other flavors, especially dark chococlate since it looks like one of those sauces that solidifies. The honeycomb is popular but in my opinion it looks odd and chewy, more for the looks. I also chatted with the servers to ask about upcoming flavors, and they said they will be adding a cereal one soon and a coffee milk tea soft serve in the near future!

This satisfied my every craving and especially reminded me of good desserts from LA's Korea town. \n\nHoney creme is from South Korea and Taiwan originally. Reviews are asking, \"I dont get what's so special about this\" and people are wondering \"what makes this different?\" \nThe soft serve is made with fresh milk and creme and the honey is from the bee farms. If you're not super into fresh ingredients or if you're not too big of a food critic, then yes, you really won't care so much for this. \n\n::Dessert::\nHoney 4.50: If you dont like it too waxy/thick, this would be a better choice than honey comb. Light and refreshing. But if I'm comparing to the ones in LA, i think the soft serve was a little off. The honey was pretty good though. The first bite everything felt perfect. As I ate more and more the soft serve was not bold enough and felt a bit plain in flavor and there was definitely not enough honey. In socal, they have a whole bottle of honey  available on the counter for you to use. Overall still good though, I believe they will improve over time. \n\n ::Atmosphere/Service/Parking::\nThe place was very clean cut and simple. There are no tables only one long bench along the window. My friend and I came on a Tuesday around 8:30pm and there weren't that many people. \nService was good.

Soft serve is crazy popular in Asia and when I heard that Honey Creme is opening their first US location and in my hometown out of all places, I was thrilled!!  While service was friendly, their soft serve did not blow me away as I had expected.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the soft serve itself was indeed velvety smooth.  You can taste the quality in each cup but at the price point they are charging and for the size, I won't go out of my way to come back.  We got ours in a cup and unfortunately, the core was hollow, leaving plenty of room for them to pack more.  One flavor that I did not get to order but noticed that they weren't skimpy about their ingredients is their affogato.  Off to the side, they were making shots of espresso out of their nespresso machine and if you like drinking nespresso drinks, you also know that those pods itself can be quite costly.\n\nI welcome them to the neighborhood wholeheartedly as it's always nice seeing new additions in the Sunset.  If I'm in the area for dinner, sure, I'd probably be back to check out some of their other toppings.  However, they definitely have some tough competitors within a 2 block radius.  For some crazy reason, more and more froyo, ice creamery, and sundae shops are popping up in the upper Irving area so being the newbie in the neighborhood, I fear that they will have to creative with their marketing to keep the steady flow of customers from returning once the grand opening novelty wears off.  I heard they were offering BOGO coupons but yesterday when we were there, we got a free cotton candy coupon for the next visit instead.\n\nGranted yesterday was their soft opening, their seating/ventilation can be improved.  It was a hotter than usual day in SF but it felt like an oven inside Honey Creme.  Many folks ended up spilling onto the sidewalk outside since they could not bear the hot heat inside the store.  Not to pick on the design/spacing of the store itself, but I wished the space was better utilized for customers to have a seat/table and enjoy their soft serve while inside the store.  By the front window, there's a long bench (no tables) that strangers are sitting up close and right next to one another enjoying their soft serve.  Maybe a counter w/ chairs or stools for that area would have been better suited?  Or, break up the bench by adding some tables?  Just some thoughts but I am sure they will continue to improve as they settle into their space.  \n\nBonus: they do offer a frequent buyer/stamp card so definitely make sure you get your stamps for each order! :)  Cash only for now too.", "author": "Janetto L."}

Turns out, it's really more about the creme than the honey. After getting some recommendations from the very friendly people behind the counter, I went with the honeycomb. I guess I had an incorrect idea of what to expect because I was expecting that kind of crumbly, melt in your mouth honey comb that I've had before, but this was just a hunk of waxy honeycomb which I didn't end up eating (not even sure if you're supposed to) because I felt like I was chewing on a candle. Also, I guess I thought they would have drizzled some more honey on the froyo itself, but they didn't (there is another flavor option that's just honey drizzled over), so my dessert really didn't have a ton of flavor. The yogurt itself was richer, creamier, and denser than is my personal preference. It's great if you like a really decadent, heavy kind of frozen treat, but I found myself pretty full after eating less than half. \n\nAt $4.50, it's an expected price point for a specialty dessert like this, but I guess I was hoping for something more unique and distinctive. I took a look at their website and I noticed that there are lots of really cool sounding flavor combos that weren't available at this location. I would have been all about that rose jam with popping grape cotton candy! I don't even know what that is but it sounds so fun!

I kept trying to pick up notes of vanilla or tart or SOMETHING but seriously, takes like cold air...maybe cold nonfat milk? \n\nService was kind and the store is minimally decorated, one long bench for seating, clean, etc. I think the \"hand crafted\" part of their tag line means that they put the toppings on by hand since this tastes like run of the mill commercial soft serve mix. \n\nWon't seek this out again since there are other ice cream and soft serve places on that part of Irving that offer more value.

You will remember this place because it's different than other ice cream shops, but not because of how delicious the desserts were \n\nMy friend and I shared the honeycomb sundae ($4.75). Here are my thoughts: \n\nPROS: \n- Yay it's a new way to indulge sugaaaaarrrrr\n- Pretty to look at since it's served in a clear, plastic cup \n- Ice cream is not too sweet, and the drizzled on honey adds on an extra kick of flavor and scent\n\nCONS:\n- THEY DON'T FILL UP THE ENTIRE CUP. The ice cream was swirled around the center of the cup, leaving the center of the cup empty\n- Pretty average ice cream. Ice cream itself was kind of flavorless so all of the flavors came from the add-on items. You are basically tasting the syrup\n- No seating so you just grab and go\n- You can't try the flavors before buying \n\nI think most people come here because they want to say they've been here, not to really enjoy the dessert. It's a fun way to eat ice cream but I think I like the $1 sundae at McDonald just as much. Haven't had too much luck finding a good ice cream shop in the Inner Sunset yet.

I think it's an Asian thing (not surprising, Honey Creme appears to be a Taiwanese/Korean mini ice cream chain!). \n\nI've tried the regular honey, the honeycomb, and the mixed grains. I really love honey and the two honeycombs that come with the honeycomb are enough for the amount of soft serve you get, but I don't think the honeycomb (the regular honey, even less so) is worth the price (despite how Instagrammable it is). You're better off buying an original and putting on some honey or fruit you may have at home. \n\nMy favorite flavor by far is the mixed grains. A drizzle of caramel is a lot sweeter than honey and it does a better job complementing the mellow soft serve. The flavor and scent of their \"grains\" reminds me of kinako (roasted soy powder, like the kind you find in warabi mochi). Like I said, this sort of dessert appeals to Asian sensibilities.\n\nThe price could be more Asian ($5 for a small soft serve is a bit hard to swallow) but at least they have a loyalty card program!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

The soft serve wasn't sweet at all so the honey was a good complement. I don't like my desserts very sweet so this was just the right amount for me.

A clean well maintained store, their menu was posted on wall behind the counter. With my terrible eyesight, I was relieved to find a handheld menu on the counter :). \n\nThe organic ice cream, sweetened by honey, appeared to be the main flavor, options enhanced with different toppings such as caramel corn, cotton candy, honeycomb, dark salt chocolate, espresso, and chocolate bean.  There was another flavor called Organic Mixed Grains which appeared to be it's own unique flavor--very interesting, for ice cream.  May try that next time. On average, cost for a small cup will cost around $4.50 each.  \n\nWe ordered the Affogato (ice cream with espresso) and the Himalayan Dark Salt Chocolate (ice cream drizzled with dark chocolate with salt), each in cups (cones were another option). The ice cream was not very sweet at all, as you would expect ice cream to be, but more rich and creamy--even the espresso and the dark salt chocolate toppings on each were not terribly sweet.

Milkcow, you have been good to me though you've just gotten to the point that your soft-serve is too sweet and is just a constant cycle of the same flavor profile over and over again. \n\nDespite the fact that you, Honey Creme, offer the same varieties of toppings such as the infamous honey-drizzle, classic chocolate sauce, fluffy cotton candy, and honeycomb, you have added handheld alternatives such as cones (with a tray for less mess) and my new favorite; the affogato (espresso poured on top), which is unique and works well as a combination. So kudos to you.\n\nAffogato // $4.50 // 4 stars - Say what?! Did I just pay almost $5 for unflavored ice cream that is essentially the high-end version of McD's with some extra coffee as an added bonus? Honey Creme seems to think so by throwing in white walls to make it more Instagrammable, by making their soft-serve aesthetically pleasing, and by boasting about higher quality ingredients (at least they use a name brand [Horizon milk] // organic). Well, that is Honey Creme's philosophy. \n\nAfter thinking straight about the whole experience, I think it's fair for what they give. For one, it wasn't cloyingly sweet as a result of the ice cream being more milky and plain tasting though was still plenty sweet especially loaded with extra toppings. The consistency was a lot nicer since it was thicker and creamier. Also, the portion sizes though manageable were quite generous especially since it was thicker than normal. On a side note, if you order it with a cone, you pay almost a dollar more but you essentially get more ice cream along with a cone and a nicer looking dessert (perfectly swirled + contrasting dark cone + golden yellow tray for color).\n\nThe overall aesthetic that Honey Creme aims for is simplicity. The place itself is small with an open kitchen, its lone communal bench, white and yellow glossy brick wall panel, and colorful bouquet of stacked cones for display. The employees were polite, patient, and very efficient in completing our order.\n\nMy only complaint that really involves all stores of this type are that they should offer multiple flavors though that defeats the concept of Korean soft-serve. Generally speaking for Asian-style soft serve ice cream, I've only found Momofoku Milk Bar in New York, Matcha Love in the Mitsuwa Marketplace in San Jose and Cha Cha in Hong Kong to offer other flavors such as Green Tea and Black Sesame.", "author": "Jacquie H."}

Honey Creme's soft serve does truly taste organic, the flavor is very light. I could understand why some of the reviews would say it's bland.

The general price per item is $4.50 for a cup that is bigger than that of bi-rite ice cream. For the uniqueness of the concept and the fresh ingredients on top of the high quality ice, cream, it is a really good place to go to for a snack on a sunny day or dessert after dinner.\n\nThe soft serve ice cream itself is probably one of the best ones I've had and I think is well worth it. You cannot compare it to that of McDonald's or Costco soft serves. It's not too sweet and is light and creamy.\n\nFor the toppings I tried honey comb (their trademark), mixed grain, and chocolate. I highly recommend all of them.", "author": "Stanley C."}

I usually don't care about ice cream but it was surprisingly good not too sweet and went well with the honey which tasted like local honey. As for the mango slush, it tasted like fresh mangos and the sweetness and ice was just right.

Honestly think they opened this in the wrong city though. We looked online to see if they had other locations and were not at all surprised to discover they are a chain from Asia. Their flavor is light- not too sweet. If you are used to regular American ice cream and desserts- and enjoy the sweetness of it, you will think this doesn't have taste. But for those who are more reserved in their intake of sugar, this hits the spot!", "author": "Jai L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-06", "description": "Before I begin my review, here's a little background information about Honey Creme:\n\nHoney Creme is a company with many locations throughout Asia and is owned jointly by Taiwanese and Korean companies. This SF location is their first in the U.S. They are known for using fresh, organic ingredients that are found locally, and for garnishing their soft serve ice cream with real honey combs harvested from bee farms.\n\nNow onto my review:\n\nI came here the day Honey Creme opened and the timing was impeccable. SF had unusually warm weather that day, making me crave ice cream like a fat kid who loves ... well, ice cream! I, myself, am not a big fan of ice cream, but looking through the photos that IG users have posted worldwide, it had really excited to try it out!\n\nGot there in the afternoon and totally bypassed any line they probably had in the morning time. The staff were friendly, energetic, and eager to take your order. Looking at the menu, though, I was a little disappointed. It's still somewhat limited, and the selections are fixed in portion size and no customization of toppings are allowed. They also didn't offer some of the items I saw online, like the Yuanyang Milk Tea with Boba - ( http://www.honeycreme-icecream.com/img/our_flavors/introduction/Yuanyang_Milk_Tea_With_Boba_Cup.jpg ) or their Churros - ( http://www.honeycreme-icecream.com/img/our_flavors/introduction/Churros_Cup.jpg ).\n\nI chose to just get a cup of their original ice cream ($3.75) to share with my friend. The cup was small, maybe too much so for many, but was the perfect size for me and my friend. To my surprise, it was good! Refreshing, airy, and not cloyingly sweet. But I also felt like I could get this kind of ice cream at many places in the city. And since I was sharing it with my friend, we asked if we could also get an extra empty cup to split the ice cream with, but they only allowed us to get two spoons. Maybe they're on a budget because the cute logos printed on the cups cost a lot?? But I honestly didn't mind because they were generous that day and gave away coupons for a free ice cream. How nice! The interior of the shop was also sweltering, and the only seating was a bench beside the window with no more sitting room, so we had no choice but to go outside to eat the ice cream. TIP: Eat fast, cause it melts fast!!\n\nI'm glad a shop like this has opened in the area, but right now, it's just a little too gimmicky and feels like a passing fad. Once the IG users have taken their photos with the shiny, golden honey combs on their soft serve, the competition will be too fierce if Honey Creme doesn't offer a wider selection or offer customization options. In the meantime, I will go back to use my free ice cream coupon. ;)", "author": "Enari L."}

My thoughts changed pretty quick as I devoured the first few bites.\n\nDespite the reviews saying that the soft serve tastes like something you could get at McDonalds, I found it to taste much smoother and tastier than anything I could get at McDonalds. The honeycomb really does make a difference when you eat it together with the ice cream, it really was a delicious pairing! Granted $5 is steep for a small cup of soft serve and a piece of honeycomb, I'd say it's definitely something you should try. Heck, I paid $5 for it yesterday and already feel like getting another one today!\n\nTwo people behind the counter, young guy and a young girl who I heard is the owner. Not much to say about the service as all they need to do is take your order and make it. The girl was extremely nice though!", "author": "R C."}

I stuck with the original milk flavor with honeycomb- it's really airy and light but after a while, it got too sweet.

I'd say share the dessert because even though it's pretty small, if you're coming after dinner, it seems really heavy due to the thickness of the ice cream and the toppings. All in all pretty good.

Their name sake is honey (honey comb, or honey), but I ended up trying the special Cereal Milk ice cream. The soft serve appears bland at first, if you're expecting vanilla, but I sort of like it. It's not too sweet and therefore you don't feel like you're overloading on sugar when you eat it with the very sweet toppings (e.g. honey). That said, I didn't end up finishing my whole cup because at the bottom (where there's no topping) it didn't taste like anything. But in concept I like this place!", "author": "J L."}

Frankly don't know what it is but it has a distinct chemical after-taste.  We couldn't even finish the sample --  it was ghastly and went straight in the garbage bin. \n\n They refer to many of their toppings as \"organic\".  The fake \"ice cream\" cannot possibly be \"organic\" --  actually it cannot possibly be ice cream.  Most of what you are paying for in their very small servings is the \"ice cream\".  Save you money for something that is and tastes real. \n\nWe can't think of a single reason to pay 4 to 6 dollars for frozen chemical glop topped with a tiny bit of so called \"organic\" sugary substance.

I got the ice cream with coffee bean while my friend got the one with dark chocolate. I didn't like the coffee bean one. It taste like the corn pop cereal BUT my friend's dark chocolate was really good. I will definitely get that next time or the honey one.
