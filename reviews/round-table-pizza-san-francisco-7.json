First time ever it was late.....called after hour and a half said it was on its way.  17 min later it arrives.  I thank the driver and open the box and the pizza is soggy and the bottom of the box is all wet.  Pizza was icky crust was totally soggy.  Called the store and spoke to the RUDEST WOMEN who told me it was because of the pineapple.  I assured her that it wasnt because I get it all the time and its definitely NOT the pineapple.  She was arguing about the pineapple, I tried to explain it was the crust and the bottom of the box that was wet and bowing because it was so wet and heavy.  I asked for a refund because she said her driver had already gone home.  Said NO REFUND but offered 25% off next time.  UM, NO.  She kept repeating OK, OK...like somehow her repeating this was gonna make me feel OK.  I told her I was NOT OK.  She said it was the pineapple AGAIN!!!  I repeated no it wasnt and Im not OK I need a refund please.  She hung up on ME!!!!!!!  NEVER NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!  IT WAS LIKE THE WHOLE BOX WAS STEAMED FROM UNDERNEATH!!!

He goes on to say that the wings are maybe too spicy for me, but that is not really a \"them\" issue. \n\nAfter some more awkward and frustrating back and forth, he says he will send someone to pick up the wings and give me store credit ... he said that was all he could do. I said \"okay\", but then he hangs up in my face before all of it could be sorted out. \n\nI sat for a second and thought about just letting go and cutting my losses, but then I spent way too much money for this and I can't eat everything!!

After giving him the address he said its on its way.  When I again brought up that it was supposed to be here in 45 minutes and now its well over that and asked what he was going to do to make it right, he simply said we're busy, your pizza will be there soon so that's it.  I told him I was quoted 45 minutes and he said well its an hour and half and the online system isn't right but whatever.\n\nI then asked to speak to the manager.  I got John.  The franchise owner.  Not even remotely better.  When I explained the situation that my order was late and I was calling and not pleased and expected him to make it right.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-28", "description": "Edit: I should have known that once I left a positive review their service / food would go to hell. The last 5 times we have not gotten what we've paid for - it's either missing toppings (normally the linguica is non-existant from the pizza) or it's a swimming pool of pizza sauce. I have ALWAYS stated LIGHT sauce yet, I get the entire can. There is a reason I state LIGHT sauce 1) I don't like much tomato sauce and 2) I'm allergic to tomato sauce. When it's light tomato sauce I can muddle through the stomach burning and mild hives but, a pizza bleeding tomato sauce is just money I've thrown away because I can't eat it. I'm over ordering out and I'm over this place - can't seem to ever get anything right or follow directions. What's the point of telling them how I want something I am paying for if they are just going to do whatever they want anyways. Must be nice to make so much money that you can just throw away dedicated customers like they were trash. Really wish I could post pictures of the disaster I just threw away but, there are no options for posting pics. ~sigh~\n\nI'm really surprised by the reviews and to be mary (you can be frank), I usually wait until after 3 - 4 visits first before writing a review - you know, just in case the first time was a \"fluke of excellence\". \n\nI tend to be a little intimidated by eateries with bright lights (I prefer ambient) but, I walked in with my roommate and Cyrus greeted us with a big happy smile and took our order. My first reaction was, \"Wow! He's in a good mood!\" which is more than I could say when I worked food service. He very happily took our order and while doing so, I was my typical observant self and noticed the place was very clean and it appeared everyone was working (despite how slow it was that night). \n\nIt was indeed, quite slow that night, there were only 2 other tables taken. The T.V. wasn't blaring loud and this is the one place I actually approve of a television - television and pizza just go together. We honestly didn't wait very long when the pizza arrived at our table and was cooked EXACTLY the way we like it - crispy pepperoni, stringy cheese...... Ohhhh, I couldn't stop eating but,  if I hadn't I would have leaked all the way home not to mention, I still had to get through my salad. Speaking of which, their salad bar was awesome! All the vegies were fresh and crisp though, I really wish they had a few more items, one being red beans.\n\nThe girl who brought our pizza to the table was incredibly nice and had a smile on her face. Good and friendly service is important to me and I base my gratuities on such - not a percentage. My gratuities are usually much higher than the percentage and I always tip at the end of my meal to ensure the entire experience was pleasant. I was really surprised that Cyrus was surprised when I tossed a few bucks in the tip jar. Don't people tip anymore for service? \n\nOverall, this was a very pleasant experience, the place was clean (though there were several stacks of pizza boxes in the back area which indicated that they were often busy), the dining booths were large (big ++) and the atmosphere was pleasant. My only regret was not sitting closer to the TV while I enjoyed my crisp salad and delicious pizza.\n\nOh! And to the corporate peoples - SERVE BUFFET! IT IS VAN NESS AFTER ALL! HELLO?!? LOTS OF FOOT TRAFFIC!\n\nUPDATE (11/29/16): These people haven't gotten any better - still completely and totally incompetent. Ordered a pizza with NO SAUCE because of tomato allergy. Ended up eating 95% of the pizza and discovered THERE WAS TOMATO SAUCE ON IT! You people trying to kill your customers?! Done and over with these people - so much for forgiveness and second chances!

My receipt says $8.39... I'm not a stickler about the $ but moreso the principle. This one star review is more for the one-trip salad bar policy... the Round Tables I've been to in the past have two options: a single trip salad bar for a reasonable price around $5-6 and an unlimited salad bar for $8-10.

Since it showed online at the discount price, I asked if they would honor it that price, it just seemed like the right thing to do. They just said No, in a very unapologetic tone with no further explanation. A little frustrated at this point, I finally agreed to the higher price. She then tells me my new total is $36!! Clearly I questioned this because that math did not add up, and I sat on hold for another 4 min for her to agree that the total was way off. \n\nWe finally got our pizza an hour and a half later and the crust was under-cooked and doughy. The crust thickness was about 2.5\" thick, because they didn't put the sauce and cheese up far enough. To top it off, we ordered a side of red sauce on the side, but they gave us ranch.

I don't know about other people but when I take a lunch break I want to relax and enjoy my time away from the office.  I couldn't believe how UN-PROFESSIONAL this owner was.  If you have an issue or something that needs to be addressed, NEVER discuss it in front of customers.  We felt so uncomfortable being witness to this.  Fortunately, the employee took the public reprimanding in stride.  I was tempted to actually go up to the counter and say something to the owner about how this was making our supposed \"relaxing\" lunch VERY uncomfortable.  But since I'm pregnant, I didn't want to any un-necessary stress.  So my sister suggested yelping this would be better.  \n\nSo I am not rating the pizza because as I mentioned before, Round Table is great.  I am rating the owner of this establishment.

I pay with my credit card online because I cannot pick the pizza up. Instead one of my co-worker went there to pick up the pizza. The girl working there \"KIM\" (name on the receipt) told my co-worker that the pizza has not been pay yet. Therefore, my co-worker pay for the pizza (pay partial with cash and the rest on his credit card). Then, my co-worker told me that he pay for the pizza and that the girl did not charge my credit card because it has not been pay. When I called the store to confirm, they say they have canceled my credit card and it will be in pending state for couple days. Couple days later, I checked my credit card statement, the charge went through. I called them again, they told me they cannot find anything and they will call me back. After two days, they never called me. I call them again and they say the owner of the store is not in and they will leave a note for the owner to call me. Once again, I did not get any calls. I call them once again and they say to call in the morning. After at least 5 times of trying to reach the owner of the place, I finally got through him today on 3/17/2015. Of course the attitude of the owner was @#$@#% and they cannot view the transaction online and nothing they can do about it. Then they told me that they reversed the credit card charge on my co-worker and the partial cash is in-store ready for us to pick it up.

During this past Tuesday my friend and I came here and ordered a pizza prior to a movie at the nearby AMC Theater. We ordered a half pitcher of Anchor Steam beer. The menu listed premium beer as $7.50 for half pitcher but they charged us $8.99. We contested the charge with the cashier but he insisted he just works there and the prices are built into the computer. I said okay, but seriously anyplace else we'd have a winning argument that the posted price is supposed to be what's charged ever if it's in error or not updated. This reminds me that I should write a formal complaint before I forgot. It's not the dollar amount but the principle.\n\nAnyway, this is still the only Round Table rotten enough to charge the Healthy SF surcharge.

We had to put our freshly delivered pizza in the oven, the second it was delivered. Why not just got to Safeway and spend less than half on a frozen pizza?! \n\n2)  I was sincerely disappointed, because, as stated above, I LIKE Round Table and would actually ORDER from this place, if it was any good.  I called them to let them know what happened, and give them a chance to redeem themselves, before I write them off. The manager said he would send me a gift certificate in the mail for the next time I order. (I didn't want him to redeliver another pizza because we had already waited almost an hour and were starving) So I thought, sweet!

The pizza wasn't too bad.  Definitely not the best I have had in the city, but it was ok.  I also got a salad to go with the pizza and I will say their salad bar is horrible.  The lettuce is some of the worst iceburg I have ever seen and they were running low or out of quite a bit of stuff.  Some of the things that were in stock, the tomatoes and cucumbers for example, looked like they had been sitting out for a while.  Plus it was $5.99 for the salad.  Another disappointment.  I can't believe I paid almost as much for the salad as the pizza.  Maybe they should just stick to pizza.  Plus, if they didn't have the $10 deal I would NOT eat there.  It would have been $18.99 for my 1 topping pizza!!!  Definitely NOT worth it!", "author": "Jessica D."}

I figured I would call to see if we were spending approx. $1,200 a month on pizza it wouldn't hurt to ask if there was any discount incentive and figured it would be a win win for both us & this location.  The worst they could say was no.  However, I was wrong.  I called at 6:00 on June 18 and requested to speak with the manager.  I was informed I was speaking with the manager and his name was Mike.  When I asked, he was INCREDIBLY rude and before I could even explain  my situation (and after being put on hold TWICE so he could talk to another employee) he interrupted me & rudely said could \"just get to the point & make a long story short.\" He then told me that even if I spent $300 a week with them, that \"he only makes 10% so he would only make $30 so whats the point.\"  He gruffly continued to say that if I wanted a discount then I would have to buy much more than $300 a week (again $1,200 a month) to get a discount & if I wanted one that I should just look to my mailbox bc that's the only discount theyre gonna give no matter how loyal of a customer you are.  Had he simply said \"no\" I wouldn't have an issue.  After all, I was only asking because I thought the worst they could say was no.  However, after the treatment I received was so condescending and rude that I will never support them nor the treatment that they dealt out.  If they treat a loyal customer like myself and my company like that, how would they treat me if I were only spending $24? To me customer service is everything and I would rather pay extra to have our pizzas picked up from now on than support them.

I believe everyone is bound to make mistakes but it is how a business deals with the mistakes that distinguishes businesses\n\nI ordered a pizza at 7 pm.  I was informed it will take 45 minutes to an hour.  At 8:30 I called to check on the status.  I was told that the pizza was sent out to my home \"a long time ago\".  I said well I still don't have it.  To which the person on the phone says \"are you sure?\"  I told her that since she obviously doesn't know how to solve the problem I would like to talk to a manager.  She said that she does not know who the owner or the manager is.  Few minutes later I got another call this time from a woman identifying herself as the manager and saying the \"truth us that the driver took the pizza but came back forgetting to deliver it\".  I then said then please be sure I get a new one since this 1 hour old pizza is going to be cold.  She said that she is warming it in the oven and will send a warm pizza.  Before I had a chance to hang up with pizza the 2 hour old cold pizza arrived (9 pm).  I called back and said that obviously you lied since the pizza is here, it is cold and she never sent a fresh or warm pizza.  \n\nAlso the manager told me more than a few times that I should not tip the driver since this is his fault.  I never see the problem at the bottom but at the top.  This is why in both cases I did tip the driver.\n\nThe biggest problem is the entire time the manager spoke to me she was yelling and I had to hold the phone away from my ear.  \n\nThe worst part is that this is the second time this EXACT same scenario happened with this pizza place.", "author": "Simone D."}
