Ordered fries and onion rings.  Pearl's is located in an unpretentious store with a few tables. Check out the menu, it's exhausting.  So many choices, so little time. The minute I first tasted the burger, the gene that tells me when to stop eating went recessive. Why I never found this place before is a mystery since it's close to the Donatello.

I've been here before, in fact, I used to live in a loft a couple blocks away. Yet, those were pre-yelp days, a decade or so ago, and in fairness had to experience Pearl's in real-time again. And so glad I re-visited Pearl's Deluxe Burgers! \n\nThe last time here I was maybe with my ex-wife? Sadly not Scarlett! This time around I was flying solo. Pearl's is on a busy street corner in the heart of the city, very urban, but as you enter you feel stress falling away at the doorway. You know you're entering awesome burger territory! Enjoy! \n\nPearl's is somewhat cramped, but it works for a burger joint. It's clean and has maybe four tables and counters at the window. You place your order at the cashier and a huge menu sits on the wall to help you with choices. I order the Pearl's Deluxe w/ Cheese, French Fries, and San Pellegrino as my drink. I sit near the window, near someone talking to them-self, but it's harmless, so all is good;P\n\nPearl's is a \"good busy\", not overly crowded, just people coming and going. Some still talking to themselves lol. The decor is like a small diner with the \"graffiti\" art bathroom in the back. Place is very clean too. And before I can count to 100 bottles... my order is brought to me. It's piping and all mine!\n\nAll in all, I have only good things to say about Pearl's Deluxe Burgers - it's pretty awesome! It's probably a 4.5-Stars in my book, but not sure if I rank the burger as top rate! It's good, don't get me wrong, in fact, the crispy on the outside, tender inside, French fries are to die for... maybe the best fries, ever!

Best burger ever granted I am not a burger guy but I had to show Pearl Deluxe some local love considering all the headlines of it having the 7th best burger in the United States! So I made the trip on foot, up the hill through Union Square and to my surprise the joint did not have a line out the door which, considering this week's news about Pearl's having one of the best burgers in the country. \n\nThe San Francisco location is like three blocks up from Union Square and worth the uphill walk. It is a small location that has seats for about 20 people or less but nowadays we have options to have this deliciousness delivered to us aka DoorDash! The staff was working very hard and they were very nice, I ordered a BBQ burger and a classic Pearl Deluxe burger with sides of fries (burgers don't come with fries). You have mustard, ketchup and very good quality pickles to serve yourself oh and water that you may pour while you wait. It was the shortest wait, less than ten minutes and my order was ready which was impressive considering business was coming in today because all seats were taken, people were walking in to take to-go's and the guys looked like they had been working very hard by the time I got there at 5 pm--trust me I know things, I did work in the food biz once upon a time. \n\nFlavors on absolutely hit! The fries had a very light crispy seasoned batter on them that made them crunchy but not so battered they felt like tempura. The burgers....wow...so good!\n\nI had the Pearl Deluxe, the classic with no substitutions or custom options,  I got the burger just how they make it with mayo lightly spread on a toasted sesame bun that had  a lettuce bed (not leaf) with red onions and a slice of tomato followed by a patty with melted cheddar cheese. The cheese was perfectly melted on the juicy patty, and the crunch from the red onion, lettuce and tomato in every bite of the Pearl Deluxe was amazing. This is a good classic burger I highly recommend it! \n\nNext time I'm going for a milkshake to really do it proper. \n\nKeep up the great work Pearl's you have something special, I'll be back!", "author": "Karlos G."}

I've had nearly ever special burger on the menu, and the best ones are the Phat Bob (the first one I ever had and IMO still my favorite), the Prized Pearl, and the Bula Burger. Definitely replace the beef patty with Kobe meat or buffalo, you won't regret it!\n\nAnd if you think the burgers are better, the fries are EVEN BETTER. Not even kidding about this, last time I came here I didn't even bother getting a burger. Went straight for the frings (fries and onion rings)! They're extra crispy because they do throw the fries in flour before frying them (so if you need to stay gluten-free, stay away from the fries). Legitimately proved I would come back here just to eat the fries. :P\n\nLast, if you love milkshakes, THEY GOT MILKSHAKES TOO. Trust me, they're excellent. Maybe don't order it with a burger and fries, that's a tad too aggressive. But ordering one on its own? Just what the doctor ordered!\n\nService here has always taken a while, but that's because they make every order only once it's been ordered. Guarantees the highest quality available! In all my times here, they've always been great to me. \n\nAnd last but not least, my last review of this place said Pearl's had sadly become cash only. Well not only do they take cards again, they have Apple Pay too! No idea about Android Pay though.\n\nNow that I'm not in NorCal anymore, I really do make it a point to come back to Pearl's every time I visit SF.

The meat was fresh, tender, and very flavorful. \n\nI also had the Oreo Cookie Milk Shake. The consistency was on the thick side but still able to use straw or spoon to enjoy it. The shake was very flavorful and they weren't skimpy with the Oreos.\n\nIf you're in the area looking for a good Burger then come by and give Pearl's a try. This is my regular spot when I am in the area. Make sure to bring Cash but if not then there's an ATM near by.", "author": "Paul V."}

I remember stopping in here randomly years ago on a SF adventure and calling it a hidden gem because it was so affordable and filling and fast. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it again... until now. It has the best and cheapest sweet potato fries. And regular fries. And burgers. Everything tastes like gourmet fast food because it's nice and greasy and filling, but so much tastier than any fast food chain. \nBe warned, it's cash only. They only offer tiny water cups so if you're really thirsty just order a water. They have a variety of burger and meal options. There's not much seating inside, so if you have a group you'll have to order it to go. You don't have to wait long because service is fast and direct.

We didn't know that, so being people who never seem to carry much cash, this was a teeny snafu. After ordering online though, we were there waiting, and they asked if we wanted it for here.

The proximity to our hotel (across the street!) and the great Yelp reviews convinced my husband and myself to try their burgers. The restaurant itself is small, with very limited seating. The ordering process was easy. Cash only, but there's an ATM in the small restaurant. The server that helped us could have been a little bit friendlier--smile every now and then, girl! \n\nMy husband ordered the Bula burger (bacon, spicy pineapple, bbq sauce, jack cheese, mayo) and I ordered the Prized Pearl (bacon, bleu cheese, grilled onion, mayo). We shared a fries/onion rings half/half and a chocolate shake.\n\nVerdict: \n\n- Bula Burger: the bbq sauce overpowered the overall taste of the burger. My husband said he didn't taste the spiciness in the pineapple. Patty was cooked as described by the server (I believe medium rare, closer to pink than red?). However, the burger patty was not seasoned enough. There was an overall lack of flavor the entire burger due to the lack of seasoning. \n\n- Prized Pearl: I was incredibly disappointed with this burger. Now, I love grilled onions...but man, this burger was just overwhelmed by the grilled onions. To make matters worse, the onions were grilled in so much oil--which was transferred onto the burger itself. Basically, all I tasted was greasy grilled onions and not much else. There wasn't enough bleu cheese in the burger to cut the greasiness and overpowering onions. And similar to my husband's burger patty, the meat in my burger was very underseasoned and didn't taste like anything. \n\n- Fries/Onion rings: decent. Both items were fried to crispy yumminess. A bit greasy, but it's fried food so that's expected. \n\n- Chocolate shake: meh. Thick milkshake upon first sip, but eventually loses thickness way too quickly. Midway through, the shake just tasted like a somewhat thick Nesquick. \n\nOverall, we were underwhelmed by our experience here. I had high hopes, but they were not met. Maybe it was an off afternoon (that happens, right?). During our next visit to San Fran, we'll probably give it another shot.", "author": "Denise P."}

This place has been on my bookmarks more or less since I've started Yelping and I finally got the chance to try it out after running the SF Half Marathon. Needless to say, I had a ravenous appetite and a juicy burger was just the kind of thing I needed. \n\nThis place is small..but packed. Our group of 7 had to wait awhile to get seated but it was well worth the wait. The menu is crazy extensive. There probably was a list of 10 or so \"special burgers\" as well as regular burgers, vegetarian burgers, Kobe burgers, grilled cheeses, and hot dogs. In addition, there was also a large variety of sides and shakes as well. Be aware that is cash only, but I do believe there was an ATM inside. Upon suggestion of someone who's been there before, I ordered a Phat Bob and a side of garlic fries for something around ~$14-16 (I forget). Not the cheapest, but I figured I just ran 13.1 miles and I might as well treat myself. Little did I know that this thing would be massive. Like two meals worth massive. That, or I have a tiny tummy. Could be both. Anyway, the Phat Bob was seriously P H A T. It was loaded with thick cut bacon, perfectly crispy onion rings, and bomb bbq sauce. By no means were they stingy on any of the ingredients. Even the side of garlic fries was surprisingly huge. They both were so filling that I could only get myself to finish half of it. I ate the other half a few hours later and it was just as great even then.\n\nAll in all, I'm super stoked to have finally tried this. Will definitely make the 0.6 mile trek out from the Powell BART station next time in the area. Can't wait to try all the other special burgers!", "author": "Gabrielle S."}

I expected it in the corner, yet it wasn't there.  \n\n+ Dining and menu board +\nThe place is fairly small and can get pretty packed.  As I stood in a long line, and in front of the fridge with sodas, I wasn't sure if people were stealing free drinks because it was crowded.  Or if they had actually paid for them and grabbed it after the fact.  Who knows?  But that's how packed it was.  The menu board was handy:  Burgers listed at $6.99 to $14.99, from Turkey to  Buffalo, respectively.  Sides and milkshakes also listed.\n\n+ Service +\nThe girl was cute, so no issue.  She gave good recommendations too!  The manager was also cool.  He sweatily hustled and served orders, made milkshakes, helped the cashier, etc.  \n\n++ Sides ++\nWe tried the Springs (1/2 sweet potato fries 1/2 onion rings, $5.99):  It was ok, but kind of flimsy.

Wish I tried the regular fries.  \n\n++ Beefy Burgers ++\n~ Pearl Deluxe with cheedar cheese ($7.99):  The bun was nice and buttery on the inside, and the patty was real beefy.  I ordered it medium rare and expected a lot of juiciness, but didn't get it.  Overall, not a bad choice.\n~ Kobe Burger with jack cheese ($13.49):  This was bigger than the Pearl Deluxe!  The burger and all it's fixings were freakin' huge.  Like I previously mentioned and at first glance, \"sometimes you just can't enjoy it in that fashion\".  Plus big bites of a dry bun aren't fun.  The kobe patty itself was like a steak, yet leaner.  It's what I expected.  Loved the patty, medium-rare as well.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  Stick with a Pearl Deluxe.  \n\n++ Overall impression ++   \nWasn't too impressed really.  I did enjoy the free chocolate shake I was given, since no one claimed it, so the manager gave it to me.  Bonus star for being nice, even though I saw him insert the straw tip down with his index finger, eek.  The Oreo cookie shake was yummerz too!  A soothing mix to help push that kobe beef down.  \n~ Was I stuffed?  Yes!  \n~ Was it worth $35?  Not in my opinion.  Sorry fellow yelpers!\n~ Would I come back?  Maybe.

A  1/2 burger cooked rare and topped with Jack cheese, bacon, onion rings, BBQ sauce and mayo. When they say rare, they actually mean RARE and not medium rare like a lot of places seem to do. The burger was massive in size and flavor. Though an excellent burger there is one thing I would change.  The amount of toppings over powered everything else just a tad. I love tasty toppings for my burger, but want the burger to be the star. That being said, the patty itself was seasoned pretty well and overall it was a pretty decent burger.\n\nWe ordered a side of frings (50/50 onion rings and fries). The fries were hot, crispy and seasoned greatly. The onion rings were home made (always a plus), plus they were cooked to perfection. I thought the onion rings could have had a little bit more seasoning on them, but in the end I was very happy with the little basket of fried joy. \n\nThe inside is very compact, so if you're extremely claustrophobic or if you just have a problem eating next to strangers, I would suggest taking the food to go. The customer service was amazing. The guy behind the counter took my order quickly, and was very friendly. He mentioned we get free refills on our drinks, which I assumed was the case anyways but it was nice to hear him say it.

Dating a vegetarian is hard sometimes, and I often get these uncontrollable urges for meat. I was really hankering for a Super Duper or an In N Out, but this Pearl's Deluxe Burger seems to be well regarded so I checked it out.\n\nPearl's is right on the edge of the Tendernob, with only a bit of poop and not too many crazies nearby. Parking was kind of a pain, and there was poop smeared all over the sidewalk right by my car door.  Not really what you want to see prior to getting a big juicy burger.\n\nI ordered the Pearl Deluxe with Cheddar. It was pretty good, in a traditional All-American sort of way. The meat was obviously very fresh, and had very good beefy flavor, and was cooked medium, as per the cashier's strong suggestion. The burger was nice and juicy, and a steady trickle of fat and juice accumulated at the bottom of the plastic tray as I  munched on the burger. The burger had a generous amount of lettuce, onions, and tomatoes, and was really thick. I had to open up wide to take a  proper mouthful. As other commenters have mentioned, the burger seems under salted. I think it would be quite a bit better with more salt.\n\nNow, the real question is how does Pearl's compare with Super Duper or In N Out? Unfortunately, while Pearl's is a very good burger, it is not as good as Super Duper or In N Out.  Although my craving for a burger has been temporarily satisfied by Pearl's, I will be heading to Super Duper and/or In N Out the next time I want a burger.", "author": "Allen T."}

Approaching this restaurant, it was clear that we both had an appetite for burgers. Couldn't wait to see what this place had to offer!\n\nWalking in, you'll notice a fairly small joint. Window seating and a few extra tables make up the dining area. Grab the first seat you see or you'll be standing the duration of your meal. The place has a large chalk board of a menu. You choose what  you want, order at the counter and pick it up when your name/number is called. Pretty simple. The staff was fast and friendly, nothing out of the ordinary. Be advised though, it's a cash only establishment. No cards whatsoever. \n\nFor dinner, I decided to get a mushroom burger on the special burger menu for $8.99 and upgraded it to a kobe burger for an additional $5.99. Aside from the burger we got a small garlic fries to share for $3.99 and a mint oreo shake for $4.99. The fries were super crispy and delicious, definitely smothered with garlic. It was to the point were the garlic would create a more spicy affect because of the amount. The mint oreo shake was nice and thick, offsetting the garlic from the fries. The kobe burger was super juicy. Along with the mushrooms, this burger was dripping from my hands. Be advised, it does get a little messy. The flavors were definitely there, good burger!\n\nIf you're in the Tenderloin and really want to try a good burger joint, don't hesitate to stop at this joint.

I love pickles and they just have it by where they keep the condiments so basically it was all you can eat pickles. That's a huge bonus for me already!\n\nI got the spicysly burger with Kobe beef. Love how you can tell them how you want to cook your burger! Most places don't really do that so another bonus point for Pearl's! I got my burger rare and it was deliiish. The meat itself was so juicy and tender and had lots of flavor. I definitely recommend upgrading to the Kobe because the meat was just so tender! The components on the burger really worked well too. The only thing is that this burger was super messy. Everything kept falling out and it was just too hard to eat so I ended up using a fork but still good. \n\nI also ordered the fries, the half regular and half onion rings. They were super crispy and tasty. The only thing is there was barely any onion rings...

It was the most amazing thing you could have in a city full of amazing food to be had.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and things are not quite the same.\n\nThe clear turning point to me was around the time they decided to stop taking credit cards and become a cash only spot. Just a bizarre decision when you're located in the heart of world-technology where any old food truck carries a Square linked to an iPad or some way to accept your money. I do understand a lot of places in the city have historically been cash-only, but when you aren't one of them, why would you go backwards a step? That alienated a lot of people I know as it did to me.\n\nThe changes have also reflected on the food. It went from the juiciest, most delicious burger, to a better than average three-star burger. The patties aren't seasoned (or minimally seasoned?) and are always undercooked. Thank God the fries still manage to save the day. \n\nIt just seems Pearl's has used its once well-deserved hype to slowly morph from a local's favorite into a tourist trap, attracting people who have heard about how great it is but were never planning on coming back again anyway - and I'm sure they enjoy their meal each time.

For $8.99, I was served up a HUGE juicy burger, toppings pouring out and fingers never clean from all the drippy goodness!  I would say the burger was actually cooked medium but was still plenty flavorful and just stupid juicy.  Topped with teriyaki, mushrooms and jack cheese, even at a half pound it was so tasty I inhaled it.  The fries reminded me of Ore-Ida Zesties, which is a compliment trust me, and their onion rings were very flavorful and actually packed a little heat thanks, I believe, to a generous crank of black pepper in their coating.  Ranch was provided upon request, as well as extra lettuce, tomato and onion for toppings, all with no upcharge!  Another freebie were large slices of homemade pickles - I'm not a pickle person but my friends were raving about them.  Nothing wrong with a free appetizer!  \n\nSwing by their bathroom when you visit too - you probably will need to because you'll need to wash your hands, napkins just won't handle this job!  Their bathroom was very tidy and flowery smelling, and in delightful contrast their walls were covered in epic graffiti.

It was quite cool!\n\nTo top off a tasty meal, the proprietors were super friendly and sociable, asking everyone how they enjoyed their meal and where they were from - neat to realize this place doesn't only survive on business from the locals, and the owner not only is aware, he is appreciative!  Definitely recommended if you're exploring SF and in need of a serious burger fix, at a very reasonable price.  Grab a stack of napkins and enjoy!", "author": "Terri N."}

Their portions are generous and me and a friend (both girls) split the burger and a order of spries and were super full after the meal. I think the only two negatives were that it's not in the best neighborhood as at one point a homeless person came into the restaurant and asked us for our fries and the other con is that this place is cash only.", "author": "Isabella P."}

I've been here a few times for lunch as it can get pretty packed since the place has a limited seating. So go earlier or later to avoid the lunch crowd. The service is really good too. The front counter was really helpful when asking questions and they bring the food to you if you happen to get a seat.

The Tenderloin District is generally seen as a place to avoid when in SF, but if you want a burger that will make you feel alive, you need to check out Pearl's.\n\nI was at the Westfield Mall near Market Street with a friend when we decided to look for a good and inexpensive restaurant nearby. After checking Yelp, Pearl's immediately stood out to me because their burgers looked great at an affordable price. It was a good 15 minute walk to get to Pearl's, but it was well worth it. At first, the restaurant seems rather plain. There's nothing on the outside that catches the eye, and the inside seems simple. But the aroma of the restaurant is all you need to be convinced that they serve good food. Pearls' list of specialty burgers is something to be admired. I had a hard time trying to decide on a burger, but I went with my gut and decided on the Phat Bob. This particular burger included BBQ sauce, bacon, mayo, onion rings, and jack cheese. I also ordered a chocolate milkshake on the side (not the most healthy meal ha).\n\nThe burger was unreal. In a world full of fast food, it's sometimes hard to find a burger that really stands out, but this burger did just that. The milkshake was great too. Overall, the meal exceeded my expectations. My friend ordered the veggie burger with a side of frings (half french fries, half onion rings). He really enjoyed his meal as well. The fries were good and the onion rings were average, but the burgers overshadow any other part of the Pearl's experience. I can't wait to go back to try more burgers on the menu. If you are looking for a healthy option and a nice dining experience, then Pearl's probably isn't the best option for you.

When it comes to burgers, Pearl's does it exactly how I like it. It seems like it's these hole-in-the-wall burger joints that perfects a great tasting burger.  At Pearl's, that's exactly what you get, a great tasting burger.  I prefer my burgers as basic as it gets...meat, cheese, and just the bun. Pearl's burgers impressed me at all levels.  I had the Buffalo Burger and it was heaven.  I'm not sure if it was the juicy patty or the light bun.  Whatever it was, it was phenomenal.  My burger was huge, juicy, and wasn't greasy at all. In da' face!  My burger was deMelished. I even have 10 Yelp Friends that gave Pearl's at least 4 stars.  Well, I take that back. One of them gave Pearl's 3 stars.  Regardless, Pearl's isn't just hype.  Pearl's is one of those stops that you need to make if you're craving a good old fashion burger in SF. \n\nAs for sides, I was torn between fries and onion rings.  So, I ended up getting their Springs (half order of onion rings, half order of fries).  I was little stuffed from my huge burger that I failed at killing my sides. But both were good.  You can't go wrong with their sides as well.  \n\nService was as good as it gets too.  The employees were all efficient and nice. For a hole-in-the-wall burger joint in the middle of the Tenderloin area, this place was also clean.  According to other Yelp reviews, expect lines out the door. We arrived right before the rush and didn't wait at all.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my first visit at Pearl's.  Hopefully, there's more to come.

Highly recommend the Spicy Sly if you like spicy. I particularly liked the shake - it was thick with chunks of banana in it. \n\nOne of the best things about this place is the owner who really sells his menu well when you enter. He gives you a quick summary of the menu offerings, recommending items and answering your Qs. The place is very small, with 4 tables total and 1 window-side bar style seating, so don't go here if you're a large party. When we came the place was full; by the time we ordered a table had opened up. But the owner joked that if one didn't open up, he would ask his friends (eating at one of the tables) to empty theirs for us :)\n\nOther disclaimers / things to keep in mind:\n- The full sized burgers are HUGE. The quarter size was a full meal so I really don't recommend getting anything larger unless you're absolutely ravenous.\n- Cash only\n- Usually packed and often has lines out the door. We went around 2:30pm on a weekday and it was still full but there was no line. Plan accordingly\n\nMy only suggestion for improvement to the owner would be to not have the avocado as cold as it was in the Avocado burger I ordered. Because the burger patty is so hot, refrigerator-cold avocado along with that feels strange to the mouth. Room temperate would have been much better.", "author": "Saba G."}

I got a mushroom cheeseburger ($9) and shared a small order of sweet potato fries ($3).  My friend got the Phat Bob, which had bbq sauce, bacon, mayo, onion rings, & cheese ($9).  The menu didn't have any specification on the weight of the burger, but it was huge, which later I found out was probably a 1/2lb!  They do list 1/4lb on their site though.  \n\nThe mushroom burger was cooked perfectly medium per requested & came with so many mushrooms (which I enjoyed), but a little too much mayo.  Burger was juicy & kind of messy.  The fries were cooked perfect & had the right amount of sweet & salty.  Just like the burger, they gave a lot of fries for a small.

We hit the Carnaval parade, listented to some music, and I had two family members from far away visiting in town. I raved about Pearl's burgers and told everyone to come with me despite that it wasn't some fancy sit down.\n\nAfter we got there, we placed an order, and my girlfriend (who's vegetarian) ordered a Veggie burger. She thought it was over, had already started walking away and the girl looked up to ask what kind of cheese. I answered Swiss for her. We proceeded to let the rest of the people order, and my dad paid.  We waited a while to get a seat (which is apart of the game, just expect it) and they brought onion rings and fries reasonably fast.  Later they brought burgers and had a chicken burger.  We said that we didn't order a chicken burger, and she said well look at this receipt right here.  It was weird, almost as if she thought we were lying about ordering a chicken burger for a vegetarian. She took the chicken burger and then went and started arguing with a young asian girl with bleached or lightented hair.  We proceed to eat slowly hoping her burger would come soon.  When we are all practically done with the burger, I get up to ask about it, and the young asian girl comes over and with attitude says \"so what exactly happened\".  I told her that we ordered a veggie burger, they brought a chicken, and we had been waiting for the new burger.  She asked \"didnt she read the order to you\", at that point if she had read the order it might have been to someone else, so i said I didn't remember, because I hoenstly didnt remember if she read it to me, or if she had read it to someone else. But regardless I was standing right there when she said veggie burger, and I said that because clearly she was trying to imply we would have to order another veggie burger.  I thought this was ridiculous, most importantly because they took the chicken burger, and never intended to order a new veggie burger until we asked.  At the least if they were going to rudely suggest it was our fault, then they should atleast tell us, and not leave us expecting it to be replaced with a veggie burger.  The girl relented, we sat back down, and she eventually brought the burger dropping it hastily on the table and not saying a word (clearly mad at us).  It was very uncomfortable, ruined our dinner, and ruined the vibe of everyone in the party.  All for what? Because clearly the ordering system wasnt organized enough? We did not make a mistake here on the order, so why should we be punished? And even if we had a part in it somehow, is this a way you treat a customer in a clearly innocent mistake between parties?\n\nThe burgers are good, but if you are trying to make this a special occasion, I would very much suggest passing for one of the MANY other good burgers in the city. The closest match with great customer service every time is probably Sam's which Anthony Bourdain called his top 3 burger. You could also go to Roam, or even Super Duper Burger. They will all be on par in quality, and avoid the nightmare customer service situation.", "author": "Jason A."}

Although I haven't been down to Pearl's in awhile, I used to frequent this place and there was NOTHING like a good, fat, juicy Pearl's burger. After my visit tonight, it is clear something is distinctly different. Not only the food but the actual restaurant.\n\nThis burger was NOT the true Pearl's Deluxe burger that I came to know and love a few years ago.\n\nThe patty was not thick and juicy as it used to be made. It did not seem hand made at all, it truly seemed like a frozen patty. I ordered medium well but it was still bright pink in the middle. You know when you have a hand made burger, you can really see all the pieces of beef and spices and fat especially when the middle is pink? The middle of this was compact, and basically solid like a frozen patty cooks up.\n\nThe bun was the most generic, dry, white bun and they don't even warm it or toast it.\n\nThis must be a different owner because they now only accept cash when previously they took cards. But hey, you can pay $4-$5 extra (after fees) to withdraw cash from the atm next to the soda machine. Like, it's 2015 and people are using smart phones to pay no, cash only is not going to cut it.\n\nThe price is the same or a bit higher, yet the quality is nowhere near what it was. The place is definitely taking advantage of the original reputation this place established.\n\nI will not be back.", "author": "Thomas K."}

I was disappointed actually.  \n\nA few problems I had with this joint.  For one thing, I'm telling you right now, if Pearls was really serving 1/2 pound of Kobe beef, the burger would probably cost about $110 dollars.  I'm not willy foo foo!  And if it was Kobe, you would be calling it Wagyu.  Maybe the beef is from L.A.  \nI think that's where Kobe Bryant lives.\n\n Then the other burger was grass-fed. Grass-fed isn't a big deal to me. The only experience I had with grass was back in senior year in high school.  That's also overrated.  Some reason it just made me stare at the chalk board...\n\nSo I decided to go with grass-fed.  I asked for it cooked medium.  So the Pearl's burger came to the table, I took a bite and noticed it was cooked well done.  No biggie.  Then I noticed the bread was stale.  That is a serious offense to me.  I was thinking about giving them Hell like they were all atheists.  But I remembered I only paid $9 bucks for the burger.  I'll live.\n\nMaybe I got Pearl's on an off night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-30", "description": "Visited San Francisco yesterday and was looking for something cheap but delicious. Checked out Yelp for the first time (really only ever used it for reviews of places I've already found, not to find new places) and found this little place. It was near where we were headed so we decided to check it out. Worst comes to worst we just walk a few extra blocks and then look elsewhere, right? It really doesn't stand out much from the outside and it can easily sneak up on you if you're looking for it while driving, probably even while you're walking if you're not specifically looking for it. It's a teensy place sandwiched between a few other food places that probably leave a lot less to the imagination. There are only a couple tables, two of which are cramped in near the register which I imagine can be annoying should it get busy in there. We didn't hit it at a particularly busy time (it was around noon) and we still felt a bit cramped so definitely don't expect to eat on site if it's crowded! For the small size and \"homeliness\" of it, it's well kept and the food isn't bad-- especially for the lower prices. It's your basic burger shop though so I wouldn't recommend visiting if you're looking for a lot of variety in your cuisine options. I ordered a mini deluxe cheeseburger (that's a 1/4 pounder if you're curious like I was; just wanted to know exactly how mini the mini really was!) with a side of regular fries and a large drink. I believe it came to around $12. Keep in mind this was just for a basic (mini) cheeseburger; prices increase as you get more \"fancy\" (i.e., adding more toppings besides the complimentary lettuce/tomato/onion/mayo or using different meat options). The bison burger was around $14 base price, excluding sides and drinks. The burger patty was a bit off center and slightly smaller than the bun so about 1/4-1/2 of my burger was just bread and ketchup with traces of melted cheese but the other half made up for it well enough. The cheese was super melty and the meat super greasy but if you like a bit of a mess and you don't mind some grease you should certainly enjoy these burgers. The fries are easily some of the best fries I've ever had, albeit a little bland (a bit of salt should do the trick though). Thickness wise they're in between thin and steak fries but they're extremely crispy and fully cooked internally, which is great because that's always a problem I have with other thicker crispy fries, without being grossly crunchy. The staff was also great. The cashier made sure to ask about every aspect of our order to ensure we got everything as customized as we wanted it. The trash bins were right next to our table yet the staff still finished cleaning off our table for us after we'd already started throwing things away ourselves. Personally I found this unnecessary but in a good way as the ambience seems more like a self-cleanup type of place. They kept up with keeping tables clean as customers left which is great so new customers don't have to wait for a clean table. If you don't mind smaller spaces, greasier (and quite filling) food, and a place that isn't exactly 100% up to date with their interior decorating, I would certainly recommend this place!\n**** They do take cash only so be sure to keep at least a $20 on you!

Then I learned that Pearl's won \"Best Burger\" challenge at the Great American Food and Music Festival, with celebrity judges Bobby Flay and Anne Burrell (no relation to Ty Burrell of Modern Family or the World Champion Pat Burrell).\n\nSuch enormous pub was enough to catapult Pearl's to the top of my bookmark list.

Sorry Tyler, I'm not jumping on the \"best burger\" bandwagon with you, but I'll give credit where credit is due. \n\nPearl's probably has the juiciest, most substantial burger I've had, though not the most flavorful.  I ordered the Spicy Sly, a burger filled with sauteed onions, peppers, spicy sauce, monterey jack cheese, and mayo.  Napkins are definitely required, and perhaps advisable to bring your own - at least half a roll of paper towels.  The problem I had was that the meat itself lacked flavor.  The sauteed peppers (granted they were delicious) overpowered the burger, so it felt more like a delicious sauteed pepper sandwich with a burger patty in a supporting role.  That's really nitpicking.  The burger was very good, though I still prefer Urbun Burger in the Mission.\n\nOther than that, the burger was legit.  I finally found buns that could handle all the crazy fixins' these places throw into burgers these days.  Sweet potato fries were perfectly fried, crispy, and sweet.  \n\nNow I get to my favorite part, the Nutella milkshake.  I've made no secret of my love for Nutella.

I ordered a daily special called California Dreamin; the description emphasized bacon and avocado, but the vegetables to meat ratio was too much for me and it was really bland. My friend's Teriyaki Kobe beef burger was very good though! \nThe fries and onion rings as good as well. I definitely recommend it on the side.\n\nApart from that, the interior is small with limited seating and I would only recommend it for groups of 2-4 people unless you plan to take it to-go. Lastly, the staff provides attentive, quick service.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

Saw all the stars and raves on the Yelp app and had to stop by!\n\nFirst off, this place is smaaaaall! There were only a handful of tiny tables. We were lucky to get a seat! But it looked like we just beat out the late night rush. Woo hoo!\n\nI knew I wanted bacon in my burger (because everything tastes better with it!). It was between the Balu Burger and the Phat Bob. Unfortunately,  I'm not into BBQ sauce, so I skipped Bob and went Balu instead. \n\nThe Balu has a spicy pineapple teriyaki sauce with bacon, mayo and swiss cheese. Definitely upgrade the patty to their kobe beef patty if you don't mind spending the extra money for it. Totally worth it. The patty is extra juicy, fatty and flavorful. The sauce was sweet and tangy and wasn't too spicy. I thought the mayo might have been too much, but the extra creamy texture really worked with it and it balanced out the heat. And you can't go wrong with bacon! \n\nGet a side of Springer, too! It's half onion rings, half sweet potato fries with a side of mayo for dipping. So. Good. Both items were fried right and the onion rings had a nice extra crisp to them. It was too bad I had to share it with the hubby. I could have eaten the whole thing myself! \n\nI really like the burgers here. They have interesting combos (but there are the simple combos, too) and their sides are great!

Standard burgers are around $9 if you don't add a bunch of extras.\n\nBula Burger is one hot mess to eat.  The pineapple teriyaki sauce will drip ALL over your hands so don't even bother wiping until you're done.  Actually, don't wipe at all and just wash your hands in the bathroom.  In addition to the beef, mayo, and Swiss cheese, you get thick pieces of bacon... so many that I actually took some out to give to the hub. \n\nBula burger is award winning?  I'm not so sure about that.  While it's good, it's definitely missing the balance of veggies.  It ends up being a whole lot of creamy.  I'm not a fan of the sesame seed bun; it needs to be buttered and toasted or something to add flavor and the proportion of bread to meat was a bit off so we ended up peeling away bits of it away.\n\nI was a big fan of the fries though.  They have a little crust around them that adds to the crunchiness.  A large size is enough to share between 3-4 people.  I don't know if I'll be returning back to Pearl's.... maybe if I was really craving a dirty burger which is usually never.", "author": "Shannon L."}

Oh, and there was this one judge on the show that I would like to do more than eat burgers with...) But out of the three choices, Pearl's was the one I really wanted to try.\n\nMore than two months after we watched the show, \"A\" surprised me by taking me to Pearl's.\n\nBut let's back up to a few minutes before we walked in the front door...\n\nWe managed to find parking a little over a block away.  In this neighborhood, you're kind of used to the streets smelling a little, well, like pee.  I stepped out of the car and it did NOT smell like pee.  It DID, however, smell like poo.  Awful, stenchiriferous poo!  Apparently, someone left a bag of gross, smeary, mushy poo IN the parking spot and we rolled right over it and got poo all over the back tire.  Blech.  \n\nDid I say Blech?\n\nI meant double BLECH!!!\n\nAnyway, back to the reason of this review - we walked into Pearl's and it was packed.  There was a line to the front door and every seat was taken.  We ordered fairly quickly, but then had to stand off to the side waiting for a table to become available.  A group of three guys came in later and stood next to us waiting for a table.  A few minutes later a table opened up and you would not BELIEVE what happened.  The three guys swooped in and claimed the table.  \n\nUmm...hello?  We were here first and were waiting for a table.\n\nOur order came out and the guy told us that was totally our table and we should open up a can of of whoop ass, so \"A\", the guy with our food, and I walked over to the table and \"A\" kindly informed them we had been waiting for a table first.  The three guys were super apologetic and said they were from out of town and got up.  They told the woman behind the counter they would take their food to go instead.\n\nSo, cool that the guys let us have the table, but not cool that they swiped it in the first place.  Apparently that's what you do when you're not from San Francisco.  (I kid though.  I really appreciated that they let us have the table.  Thanks three guys from out of town!)\n\nOh, but the FOOD!  We decided to go light and split the Bula Burger, because that's the one they highlighted on \"Best in Chow.\"  We got chicken rather than beef, so it was lighter.  Definitely tasty, but maybe because, for some reason, I like pineapples in my burgers!  We also got a side of fries.  Just the fries, not the frings, or the other half/half options they offer.  They were really good fries.  I would go back just to order the fries.  Yummy, crispity goodness!  We also ordered a chocolate peanut butter shake, but I think all we got was a peanut butter shake.  It was still delicious though.\n\nWhen we were almost done eating, the owner came over to chat with us because he recognized \"A\" from \"Best in Chow.\"  Yeah, if you haven't figured it out - my darling \"A\" was one of the judges in the burger challenge!!!!  \n\nWe also let another couple share our table with us.  Because we cool like that.\n\nAbout $18 for the two of us.  Cash Only.", "author": "Kris L."}

At first sight it appears to be a small unpopular food joint but when you walk inside you are greeted with the smell of cooking beef patties. You are then greeted by the clerk who takes your order with ease and you sit down. Although there aren't many seats the people before you leave so you sit.\n\nAfter a while your burger comes (I would recommend the phat bob ) you smell the 1/4 or 1/2 pound patty and dig in.

It just looked like your run of the mill hole in the wall burger joint. It took someone who isn't even from this country bringing it to my attention to finally decide to step in, and holy sh!t....\n\numm... yeah... How blind was I??\n\nThis place is ridiculous good. Easily one of my favorite burgers ever, let alone here in San Francisco. It's pricey, but the upgrade to buffalo meat is well worth it. The little paper on the wall with buffalo fun facts had me sold, and after trying it, it's pretty much become my default.\n\nThe Bula burger is kinda what they're known for, however i prefer just the standard Pearl's Deluxe. Throw some crispy bacon on there and some american cheese. Good god...\n\nThe fries and onion rings are also delicious and crispy, so i often go for the \"Frings.\" If you like pickles, they also have a self-serve container of pickle Spears.\n\nMy only real wish would be for the buns to be a little more sturdy. They often sort of begin to fall apart as i get to the last 1/3 of my burger. But the bun is delicious though.\n\nFinal note: GO HERE", "author": "Charles Michael B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-11", "description": "This place did not disappoint at all. I admit, they have very limited seating (like about 4-5 tables only) and their prices might be a little high for the burgers, but you will definitely get what you paid for. There's a reason why they call it Pearl's DELUXE burgers. \n\nI ordered a TERIYAKI BURGER medium-well (grilled mushrooms, teriyaki sauce, mayo, and jack cheese) and a small side of SWEET POTATO FRIES. I had them cut my burger in half so I can share 1/2 with my cousin. My cousin ordered a BBQ CHICKEN BURGER (bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese). She also had it cut in half so she could share 1/2 with me. For her side, she chose GARLIC FRIES. We shared that as well as a side of ONION RINGS with my sister.\n\nWhile waiting for our order, we lounged around standing waiting for a table for 4 to be gone since seating was so limited. Luckily, a group of 4 elderly people saw us waiting and so hurried up and finished their garlic fries (thank you, so much, but you didn't have to rush on those fries).\n\nSo I was able to taste a good amount of food and sides from Pearl's and I must say, that all the burgers and sides I tasted were phenomenal (though I did prefer my beef-patty burger to the chicken burger my cousin ordered). \n\nMy TERIYAKI BURGER was very well made, they made sure it was medium-well, the way I wanted it. They had the right amount of sauce and the jack cheese was fully melted thoughout the burger. As for the sauteed mushrooms, they did not go cheap. There was sliced, sauteed mushrooms everywhere throughout the burger and they weren't puny either, they were pretty big. \n\nMy cousin's BBQ CHICKEN BURGER was alright. I loved the bacon as well as the grilled onions (I would take my fork and get all the ones that fell out). The chicken was a bit dry, in my opinion, but it might be due to me eating this half of the burger after my burger so it was about 20-30 minutes old? Hehehe. I'm trying to make up excuses. \n\nAll the sides we ordered were amazing. The SWEET POTATO FRIES weren't limp, but were well fried and sweet like they should be. The GARLIC FRIES were also very pleasing with enough garlic to accompany each fry. Also, the way they were fried made it extremely crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Nice touch. My favorite though would be the ONION RINGS (I love, love onion rings). They were well seasoned and crispy on the outside. What I loved about them was that when you bit into them, the outside crisp wouldn't fall apart in my hands, it was very well intact (one of my pet peeves for onion rings). \n\nI definitely wouldn't mind visiting Pearl's Deluxe Burger again, but this time I would probably share one meal and a couple of sides since it was pretty big portions.", "author": "Diana N."}

You can get at least 4 kinds of patties here.  Plain old beef (they already use great quality meat), Kobe, Buffalo, and at least one other one (like ostrich, turkey, or veggie or something - forgot.)  On top of the kind of patty you choose, they have many varieties of toppings. \n\nI've had their plain old burger with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their fancier burgers with all kinds of goodies on it.  They are all EXCELLENT burgers.  Pick what sounds good to you, and you'll be happy with it.  There aren't any real bad choices.\n\nSome notes:\n-- The Bula burger is worth the awards it gets.\n-- You can tell the Kobe is juicier.  The regular beef is good too though.  Kobe may not be worth the $4 premium on a regular basis, but try it at least once.\n-- Buffalo burgers rock.  They are better for you, and only a few people can tell what they're getting - they're still juicy and tastes like beef.\n-- Their fries and onion rings are A-OK.\n-- Their buns are perfect sesame seed buns.  Not silly kaiser rolls, or anything dumb you get at fancier burger places.\n-- They actually cook your meat to the temperature you ask.  You want Medium?  It will actually be slightly pink.  I've eaten here at least 5 times, and they haven't missed yet.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, Pearl's is worth a look see.  Heck, if you're within a few miles, it's worth a detour.  \n\nPearl's was our first and last meal on our trip to San Francisco.  What does that say?", "author": "Anson G."}

It was good sized, delicious and cooked just how I wanted it (medium). I read the Yelp reviews and saw so many comments about the spries- so naturally, I had to get an order. Half regular fries, half sweet potato fries. People weren't lying, these were great! The regular fries were nice and crispy. \n\nThe staff was friendly, and there is a small container with some free for all pickles. I'm not sure if they limit you, so I only took one.

The burgers are still great but my sweet potato fries were a little dry from being overcooked. The shake, which in all honesty is the real reason we walk a mile uphill to lunch on Post Street, was not right at all. It was way too thick and there wasn't enough chocolate mixed in with the peanut butter. Normally you can't get me to share my milkshake with anyone because I slurp that sucker up til my straw makes annoying noises. But after we left Pearl's I ended up throwing away a 3/4 full cup in the trash can down by Market Street. Totally sad panda!

Cafeteria-like seating / tables (limited as well) and a small counter to order from up front. I'm sorry Pearl for judging you before I tried you. You definitely showed me up though.\n\nBurgers: regular size is 1/2 lb of meat, or you could order a mini for 1/4 lb of meat. You can order a regular hamburger (called a Deluxe) and add your own cheese and bacon, or you can order from the special ones (Phat Bob and Bula are the favorites).\n- Meat: medium-rare is the way to go. perfectly pink interior, great flavor, tender, and juicy\n- Buns: baked fresh daily (from a bakery that I don't remember the name of) and topped with a generous amount of sesame seeds. This was my least favorite part of the burger, a tinge of staleness and top bun was a bit big.\n\nFries: zomg. Perfectly fried. Tried both the Sweet Potato Fries as well as the regular Garlic Fries. SPF's were thick and crispy, soft interior. Garlic Fries were infused with garlic flavor, with a perfect crunch and thick enough to get a good soft potato inside. Still can't get over the minced garlic in the fries.\n\nShakes: 20+ flavors, and can be customized (one guy got a blueberry cheesecake with pineapple milkshake, to which we smiled and nodded.. to each their own). Didn't have enough space to try the milkshakes, but I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the city!", "author": "Jennifer M."}

I'm a little odd but I like my burger meat a little on the drier side in terms of how long it's been on the grill.  I like that taste meat gives off when it's been on the grill slightly past the point most people like it, when more of the lipids has dripped off.  Their buffalo burger is a loving warm textural lean red meat that doesn't feel too heavy.  Warning to the Ladies, if you can split a burger -- do so; a whole burger is just crazy big.  My husband with the hollow leg had trouble shaking down his buffalo bula burger.  \nI usually get the peppery \"spicy sly\" buffalo burger.  I always hold the mayo because the buffalo meat is so flavorful, it doesn't need it.\n\nOnion rings here are fresh and sweet.

We might not know where Canada is on a map (It's next to Transylvania, right?), but we know what constitutes a burger. And SF has an embarrassment of riches in the burger department. Sure, we've got the usually McD's and Burger Kings about (I miss the Wendy's on Market), but those all taste the same. Good thing we have no shortage of old-fashioned burger joints around town.\n\nAh, Pearl's. If there's one thing about which I'm skeptical, it's a turkey burger. I know it's supposed to be healthier, but that doesn't mean it has to be devoid of taste. Pearl's makes a mouth-watering selection of burgers and the turkey burger I had when I first wandered in (it was a helluva New Year's night) made me want to get on my knees and thank God.\n\nIt's too bad their Market St. local didn't work out, but I think of this as the only \"real\" Pearl's anyway.

Good burger, but messy to eat. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?userid=8Ces6YdT6j7BYycnZLrSng#3PNWVeX89qUC_2tck2_nKA\n\nThe menu can be confusing, so I'll summarize the options. Most signature burgers are in the $7-9 range (without extras), the plain/ chicken/ turkey burgers and mini sizes cost less. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ#lKNTHMbvi0HLRS_8Uu5FXQ Any burger can be made with buffalo meat by adding $2.49, or with Kobe beef for $3.99 more, but those meats are not available as mini.\n\nIf you've never been here before, u should know that their burgers are 1/2 lb. and the \"mini\" are 1/4 lb. (equivalent to a \"regular\" at other places). So u can split a burger with someone or order the mini version, if you're not that hungry. The special burgers are VERY messy, like that Carl's Jr. commercial with a burger that drips all over (because of the teriyaki sauce, BBQ sauce, etc).\n\nThe sides - cole slaw, garlic fries, regular fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries - are also available as combinations: Frings (fr+rings), Spries (fr+sweet fr) and Springs (sweet fr+rings). Most people rave about either the crinkle cut sweet potato fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ#YL5zbyA7BjXoPywxvB_VhQ or the onion rings (which are similar to the ones from Jack in the Box or Burger King). Both are good.\n\nI LOVE the milkshakes - $3.49 for the regular flavors and $3.99 for the special flavors, with about 10 different flavors in each group. The mud pie shake (brownies and chocolate) is a new favorite.\n\nNo opinion on items I haven't tried yet: veggie burger, hot dog, chili, and the salads (garden, cobb, asian chicken).\n\nTips:\n\nCheck your takeout order before leaving, because mistakes can happen. One time I received 'Frings' instead of 'Springs'.\n\nAnd the kitchen can be inconsistent. One night my fries were way too salty. I didn't complain that time, because the 2 cooks looked angry. Maybe they were having a bad day. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pearls-deluxe-burgers-san-francisco?select=SikRV7WAxjrPjoLM_3V3TA#SikRV7WAxjrPjoLM_3V3TA", "author": "Luis C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-19", "description": "Staying in the neighborhood in an AirBnB rental and a chalkboard in the apartment had the words \"Pearl Burgers ~ Prized Pearl + Garlic Fries\" written on it.  Hoping it was left there as a suggestion, and not a warning, we made our way over to the restaurant.\n\nYelp said it took credit cards, but a sign on the door announced CASH ONLY. Luckily, we had cash, but they do have an ATM as a backup.  I don't actually have an ATM card (long story), so it wouldn't have helped me as much as correct information on Yelp would.  As soon as we set foot inside, I knew we were taking the meal to go.  It wasn't so divey that I'd refuse to eat there, but it was crowded, and I wasn't going to wait for a cramped table.  This wasn't a big deal since we were staying nearby.\n\nWaiting in line I heard the very efficient guy manning the register take the order from the customer in front of me.  My ears perked up at the \"How would you like your burger cooked?\" question and the \"medium rare\" response.  Really? This dive hole in the wall not only cooked to doneness, but was willing to stop below medium?  Be still my bloody rare heart.  \n\nWe ordered the Prized Pearl and the Garlic Fries, because the chalk board in the apartment told us to.  We also got The Bomb (chili burger).  They asked for my name and we made our way to an empty spot to stand and wait for our food.  About 5 minutes later my daughter lamented that she'd forgotten to say \"No mayonnaise.\"  They seemed really together and efficient so I decided to be that annoying person who goes up and asks to customize my order while it is already in progress.  They handled that without an eye roll or a hitch.\n\nSoon a large bag was handed to me.  During the hand-off I caught the most alluring fragrance of mega-garlic wafting out of the bag.  Once we got on the street, I told my daughter \"smell this\" and waved the bag under her nose, our eyes met over the fumes and we double-timed it back to the apartment.\n\nThe garlic fries were great. Extremely garlicky, and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  They were great even after being trapped in a box for the walk back to the apartment.  I imagine they'd be even better if there'd been enough space too eat at the restaurant.  Fried food goes downhill quickly.\n\nThe Prized Pearl's bottom bun was completely soaked through and disintegrating from the juices.  This is a problem with To Go food, and I'd still rather have a juicy burger than a dry one.  Luckily there was a spare dry bun available from the chili burger because that works better with utensils anyway, so new bun to the rescue on the Prized Pearl.  It was very tasty.\n\nWhy was the chili burger bun dry?  Because they actually go ahead and package the chili separately as a side for To Go so it doesn't just all turn to mush.  Very good move on their part.  The chili burger was also good, but their housemade chili wasn't really to my taste.  It wasn't bad chili, as in overly greasy, or made with crap ingredients or anything, it just wasn't my particular preference, crossing a bit more over into the sweeter notes.  Not a big deal, definitely edible, but I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nWe'd absolutely eat there again if staying nearby.", "author": "mstori .."}

They have quite a large selection of burgers but I'm a sucker for blue cheese so went with the Prized Pearl and ordered side of sweet potato fries. Partner had the The Bomb burger smothered in chili. My burger was so flavorful. The bacon was thick and.. well, it's thick and it's bacon what else can I say?!? LOVE bacon! Blue cheese and caramelized onions was added bonus. The meat was cooked perfectly, and very moist. Ok, greasy! haha Fries were yummy. My partner's chili burger was gone in 5 seconds.. I think he inhaled the whole thing haha. \n\nI do regret not seeing on the menu garlic fries because I saw someone else ordered them and they looked sooooo good! Smothered in garlic?! Heck yeah!

The sweet potato fries were cooked well, had a nice texture though maybe not crunchy enough for some people and were unevenly salted, but otherwise very good. \n\nThe pesto burger, cooked medium rare was pretty darn perfect. I ate almost the whole thing except for maybe a third of the bun. Most of the time when I order a burger elsewhere, I leave most of the bread behind because most other places make their burgers so dry, that having to eat all that dry bread along with the dry meat would be a real chore for me. No such worries at Pearl's. My burger meat was juicy and flavorful, topped with a generous slice of Jack cheese (no paper-thin, barely visible cheese here) and lovingly slathered with enough pesto sauce to leak out of the sides with each bite.  \n\nYou'll need at least 4-5 napkins...

I have ordered the mini deluxe burger twice, the pearl's burger once, and the spicy sly. The spicy sly is very oily and it's not spicy (plus, it's a weird burger with some bell peppers). The bun overall is very unimpressive. The patties are on the dry side. I really wanted to like this place because it's really close to where I live. But the burgers are just really not juicy. And I really don't like their buns, which are not soft. \n\nThe burgers are also really really overpriced. 9 dollars for a burger only is really expensive. I have to spend about 15 dollars on myself whenever I visit this place. Wish it can be cheaper or maybe have a combo with the fries. \n\nBurgers goes from 8.99. Mini burger is 6.99. Fries are 2.99 (small fries). The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because their fries are really good and crunchy. I would come back for the fries, but definitely not the burger. \n\nI also remember that the first time I visited, I said no to the drinks and a person in the back said something like \"who orders burgers and fries without drinks?\" It was rather unpleasant overall and I've been hesitating to go back. If not for how close it is to me, I would have never come back after the first time.", "author": "Erni L."}

OK, OK...of course.\n\nSeduced by a feature story in the Chronicle's 96 Hours Thursday supplement, I saw a burger with my name on it. Pearl's does not serve the big, bulbous and hand-molded hamburger you would get at a more expensive eatery. Don't get me wrong...I love those as well. This is definitely the school of identical flat patties. The difference is that the meat is grilled so well it becomes a piece of circular, piping hot art. And it certainly tastes fresh, not at all packaged.\n\nThe $4.99 Deluxe Burger with Cheese is delish and may well be on the pantheon of In-n-Out. The fries are nice and lightly crispy, and they come in their own separate red basket so as not to mix your greases. Definitely a thoughtful gesture. And there seems to be an unspoken opportunity to refill your drinks since no one winces when you do.\n\nI was gratefully at Pearl's when it was close to empty. Very clean and new, it's a teeny-tiny place with five little duet tables and a counter for three. That's it...and I can imagine it being as bad as an IRS office on tax day during peak meal times.\n\nThey have turkey and veggie burger alternatives, grilled chicken sandwiches and even salads. Carnivores can remain indifferent to such variety since they offer specialties like mushroom. teriyaki, pesto and a rather idiosyncratic creation -the King, a burger with a hot dog as a toppings with gobs of cheese and 1000 Island dressing. Oh my.\n\nThey are open until 2AM if you dare. As you probably know, the transitional area between Nob Hill and the Tenderloin does not provide much opportunity for easy street parking. Perhaps you can join me on the uphill climb up Jones to earn your burger. It's worth it.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...one juicy burger and plentiful fries well priced\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...one cute, compact place...unless it's crowded at which point it probably becomes the survival of the fattest\nSERVICE - 4 stars...fast..and hey, he even comes to your table\nTOTAL - 5 stars...a good burger is not that hard to find anymore", "author": "Ed U."}

Therefore if you'd like a regular burger, pretty much homemade type of quality, that is hearty and will fill you up--this is the place to go. The buns were small but very puffy so they have the same mass as regular buns. And they are so cute! They are seasoned with all kinds of seeds.\n\n I came here expecting delicious burgers, and that I got, just not in the sense of having an out-of-this-world flavor. Because there's little grease, the flavor is only slightly bland, but that's the standard.

I like most of them. That said, I can tell the difference between a great burger, a good burger, and a bad burger. Criteria are things like meat quality, correct doneness, juiciness (also known as not putting a weight on the fucking burger), bun flavor and texture, quality of fixins, seasonings, and maybe some other factors I'm forgetting. My exact rating might not match yours, but we'll probably be within the same ballpark. If we disagree, you can rest assured that you're wrong.\n\nYou also have to take into account the price. A 4-star burger and fries at $14 dollars would be a 5-star meal at $7... and that's basically what we have here at Pearls.\n\nI've been to Pearl's on Post three times now, so I feel like I can write balanced review. Everything is good. Meat is good, and cooked to order. Bun is tasty, although as other reviewers have mentioned, a little delicate. Toppings are generous and fresh, especially the bacon, which is great. Mushrooms are freshly sauteed to order. Oh, and lest you miss out, the pickles are self-serve on the counter, and they are frickin' awesome. The fries are... okay. Boring, honestly. Obviously frozen, and a little mushy, but they get the job done.\n\nSo if it were a $7 combo, or even $9, then this would probably be a 5-star review. I think that $14 is a little much to spend for a burger and fries, though. On top of that, the burger patties themselves aren't huge, maybe 1/3 of a pound?\n\nI will certainly go back. Pearl's is 2 blocks from my apartment, and the food is good, just a little too expensive.", "author": "Dave T."}

The burger was good (Pearl's Deluxe; no bacon, no cheese), but nothing incredible. I don't get the impression that the flavor issues were unique to training day events. Which also included the wrong order being delivered, orders taken after mine being delivered first, incorrectly assembled and cooked order. \n\nI would also recommend skipping their tomatoes; pretty confident that they are hydroponic and coupling that with a bland burger doesn't help either achieve greatness. \n\nThe onion rings were good, the place was clean, and the people friendly. Would try again.\n\nA few recommendations for the establishment:\n1. Season the burgers. If you are already do it more or switch seasonings. \n2. Don't train everyone at once. Unless you can't avoid it. \n3. If what you add to your product (aka tomato) isn't adding anything positive then it is taking away from the end result. \n4. Medium is a little more done than what you are hitting.\n5. Regardless don't be too diligent with cleaning the flat-top.

It was a great burger already, beating all of my experiences in Atlanta, but my second experience had it beat when I ordered the Bula Burger with Kobe beef and cooked medium. I took a bite and I died, mostly because every burger after this will never be as good. The bula sauce is genius; the sugary, acidic sauce cuts the richness of the burger, bacon, and cheese so delicately. The owner of the store claims that Chef Bobby Flay stole the bula sauce from him. \n\nA thing that earns great marks in my book is that there is a vat of free pickles. I love pickles and I cannot get enough of them, so having a free self serve area is the only thing that could've beaten the burgers. \n\nI plan on flying to California to see my boyfriend again.

After a long day of walking around, discovering how not to hang out of a street car, and watching scores of cat owners flee a burning building while the fire department do a stellar job of sorting out the whole sorry affair, I was knackered (that's British for \"pooped\") - not to mention the jet lag and hayfever. It was time for a break. So, on the recommendation of a friend I decided to find Pearl's - I looked on the map. \"What luck, it's across from my hostel!\" I thankfully didn't exclaim in the breakout area of the hostel.\n\nI closed my laptop lid, splashed some water on my increasingly tired-and-showing-it face and headed across the road for some much-needed nourishment.\n\nI decided to keep it simple; blue cheese on a burger, with everything else on it (except mayo). The friendly lady asked \"what kind of fries would you like?\" and despite replying with \"yes please\" in my almost-passing-out state, she agreed to get me some small fries.\n\nI waited patiently with another diner-to-be who was passing the time by playing some Farmville on his phone. \"Why,\" I wondered, \"would a grown man play Farmville at all, let alone on his phone?\"\n\nSoon my attention was diverted elsewhere though, as I noticed in horror my terrible mistake: the mistake of not properly reading the menu. Had I known that I could have ordered a burger with pesto on it, or with avocado, or perhaps a kobe beef burger instead, then I would have gone with one of those. \"Alas,\" I mourned, \"My first meal in this city I have longed to enjoy for so long is going to be mediocritised by this... this... 'DE-LUXE' burger; this standard, run-of-the-mill burger whose only notable trait is the addition is blue cheese instead of the normal, plasticy, film-thin cheese normally found in burgers.\"\n\nSoon it was too late - I was to face my fate. Pearl (or whom I assumed to be Pearl) handed me my brown paper bag. I forced a smile and thanked her, thinking only of what could have been between myself and the pesto burger. I walked slowly down the street towards Union Square, replaying the scene in my mind as I ate the delicious fries that were crunchy on the outside yet moist and soft on the inside. As I savoured the delicious flavour of their seasoning I wondered if I would ever again get a chance to try the Spicy Sly or the Prized Pearl. \n\nSoon I reached my destination - the stage where the final act of this tragedy would be shown: Union Square. I sat on a bench; a pigeon eyed my food, and seemed to turn its beak up and fly away. A man walked by with a dog and the dog seemed to whimper at the thought of such a shameful excuse for a burger.\n\nI reached into the paper bag, and pulled out the sturdy plastic container which held the burger with absolutely no leakage of juices or dampening, like what one would expect with some burger joints.\n\nI placed it on my knee, prized open the lid and beheld it in all its dreadful normalcy. Although it appeared large and juicy, I knew the truth - I knew that it was merely a mockery of the wide and exciting array of burgers which were otherwise available to me.\n\nI picked it up with two hands. My muscles almost straining from the mass, I managed to bring the sandwich to my lips, open them up, and make a small bite into the burger.\n\nI chewed slowly, expecting the worst: mere satiation. And yet, something was not right. Not only was this burger satiating... it was satisfying, nay; it was a pleasure. It was as juicy as it looked, and the description used for the fries earlier would apply just as readily to the buns surrounding the patty.\n\nThe generosity with which Pearl offers up onions is matched only by the perfect ripeness of the tomatoes, crunchiness of the lettuce and tanginess of the blue cheese. This truly was an excellent burger. Perhaps one of the best I have ever eaten.\n\nPearl, you have not disappointed. This was an excellent twist in a tale which set me up to expect the minimum, and you went above and beyond the call of duty. It was exactly what I needed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I won't be coming back for my pesto burger.", "author": "Daniel H."}

You order at the front and they call out your number in about 7-10 minutes. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nNo frills, small diner feel; several tables and window seating for about 10 people max. \n\nPARKING:\nStreet parking is a bit difficult since it's located in the TenderNob.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love burgers but NOT ones that squirt and drip oil. After all, I do want to be able to live to 30 years-old w/o having to get a triple by-pass. \n\nPerhaps, I ordered the wrong thing or came on an off day, so for now, I'm going to be super generous and give Pearl's 3 stars.

I got the teriyaki veggie burger with grilled onions - it was huge and dripping with teriyaki sauce.  So, so good.

I've learned some new tips for eating at Pearl's though...so follow some simple steps to a streamlined visit to Pearl's.\n\n1. Know what you're going to order or others ahead of you. Most times they're regulars and don't want to be rude and tell you, \"are you ready yet?\"\n\n2. Know which type of  protein you're going to pick out. Is it the Estancia? The Mini? The chicken burger? What temp? Be prepared people 'cause there are lots of options here.\n\n3. Fries? Strings? Frings? Springs? Milkshakes? There's like 20 different options so again, know what the hell you're doing. I empathize with newbies overwhelmed but be strong and firm about selections 'cause you just can't go wrong with any of them.\n\n4. Have money ready at all times. (a $20 should suffice.) For my mini Phat Bob, order of Springs and a chocolate banana milkshake, it usually comes out to about $15 and the change which goes directly into the \"Sex People Tip Jar.\" Who can argue with that logic really?\n\n5. When  you receive said bundles of joy promptly delivered by the cooks usually (and I have no idea how they who ordered what but they do), I advise taking rings and possibly your watch off and secure them in a pocket. Why? The juices-that's why. You'll be so busy wiping beef juice and habanero pumpkin, bbq, or pineapple sauce off your fingers, why not save your poor jewelry some damage? I found my burger trying to make a run down my sleeve the last time and luckily my watch was already in my jacket. Whew!\n\n6. If dining in, I suggest a counter spot if possible so you can get some sufficient people watching in and enjoy a nice breeze by the window. You can relish in the fact that you're enjoying one of San Francisco's best burgers and at the same time make others jealous when they see the joy on your face.\n\nMy latest recommendation is the Phat Bob. Organic beef with jack cheese, bbq sauce and two fat onion rings paired with a side of sweet potato fries can never do you wrong. My last visit to Pearl's took 20 minutes from counter to mouth wiping. It was that damn good. Take my recommendation and save yourself the heartache of lowering your standards to a place like Jack in the Box of Burger Joint. Eat at Pearl's and support local business. Your mind and stomach will thank you (and me.)", "author": "Jessica K."}

Perhaps it came down to two main mistakes: the over-hype from the BF which set my expectations through the roof, and the decision to order burgers for pick-up to devour at home (out of convenience and one part laziness, of course).  \n\nUpon their arrival both our burgers were a bit soggy. The meat paddy was juicy, and I really enjoyed the sesame bun on top. I don't remember the exact burger I got (which speaks to how unmemorable it was) but I remember thinking the depth of flavor in the accompanying sauce needed exploring.  However, sweet potato fries are always a must for me if they're on the menu, and those did not disappoint. \n\nOverall, the flavors were good but nothing exquisite.

It is located in the Tenderloin/Nobhill district so it's not filled with too many bums. There are a couple tables, 1 table that seats 4 and 2 tables that seat 2 people.  There's is also a counter style table by the window that seats 3 people.  \n\nOn to the food.  My boyfriend ordered the Prized Pearl with kobe beef and blue cheese and I had the Mini Deluxe Burger with American Cheese.  We shared the Frings (1/2 order Fries and 1/2 order Onion Rings) and a Nutella shake.  \n\nBF asked for medium rare but his meat came out well done.  My burger was cooked perfectly.  I asked for medium rare and it came out nice and pink on the inside and super juicy.  The regular burgers are 1/2 lb and the mini burgers are 1/3 lb.  The mini burger was a good amount of food considering I still had to eat Frings and the shake.  Burger bun had sesame on top and was toasted perfectly so it was soft but also had a crunch. Meat and veggies were very fresh and pickles were yummy. The onion rings were prob best I've had, stayed crunchy the entire time and didn't fall apart. The nutella shake was nice and thick and they give you a boba straw to drink it so you don't have to waste too much energy sucking the life out of it.  Tasted mostly like a chocolate shake, would've liked a little more hazelnut flavor in it.  \n\nAll in all, we would come here again.

Ok it's not that terrible for you, but it felt like it after eating 2 burgers.\n\nThe interior has a diner-like feel from the bright red and white in spite of the lack of booths, but most importantly, this place is CLEAN. The staff brings the food to you in spite of also giving you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. The 1/2 lb Deluxe, Kobe and Buffalo (as in buffalo meat, not buffalo sauce) burgers are served as standard burgers w/ the usual fixings, but we opted for the specialty burgers where you can choose to get a 1/4 or 1/2 lb patty.\n\nThe Spicy Sly packs a slow-rising burn, as the first few bites are no big deal but then you realize that you've got a great tingle going when you're halfway through the burger. The veggies are sauteed to appropriate done-ness, and the burger was cooked to medium as desired. The Phat Bobb was a bacon-burger like none other: this place serves fairly thick cuts of bacon and packs it in, to the point where I was completely distracted from any possibility of onion rings (no seriously, I don't remember if there were onion rings in my burger). For their garlic fries, they don't use garlic powder or flavored oil but instead put an ample amount of raw minced garlic on top of the fries, amazing! The chili cheese fries were a little disappointing as the chili seemed to consist entirely of beans (no onions, no meat, just beans), but the fries are batter-fried (a la Burger King style) so they have great texture. Additionally, you can get unlimited kosher pickle spears next to the soda machine. My only other complaint is that the bun is rather plain and flimsy and I wish it was made of heartier stuff, but then again, at the end of 1/2 lb burger x2 with 1/2 an order of chili cheese fries, your body will probably thank you for avoiding the additional carbs.\n\nThe prices here are really reasonable, and they serve a multitude of ice cream shakes (although I'm not sure if they use soft serve as there is a soft serve machine plainly visible at the register) as well as beer.

The Kobe beef patty they used was big and juicy and was cooked to perfection (medium rare). Besides the Kobe beef patty this baby was also topped with crispy bacon, Swiss cheese, onion rings, mayo, and their delicious spicy teriyaki sauce. This burger was so juicy (not greasy) that when I picked it up and took the first bite all the juice from the Kobe patty dripped out of the patty, and down my hands and wrist. It was so tasty. \n\nTo go along with my Bula I also got a side of their crinkle cut sweet potato fries. These fries were great. For a dipping sauce I got a side of their homemade pesto. Their pesto is pretty good but not the best I have ever had. \n\nTo top off the meal I decided to get one of their homemade malts. OMG I truly think they have the best malts in all of SF. \nWhat makes them so good is that they use fresh ingredients when preparing them. I ordered a peanut butter and banana malt and when they started to make it I knew it was going to be great. They started off by pouring soft serve vanilla ice cream into a big cup, then they pulled out a fresh banana, cut it up, and threw it in with the ice cream. Then they took out a jar of PB and put 3 huge scoops into the cup. To finish it off they added some malt mix and blended all the ingredients u together. Words can't explain how good this malt was, I loved it so much. Every sip I took contained pieces of fresh bananas and PB. In fact I loved their malts so much that I went back the next night and ordered a blueberry malt made with fresh blueberries. \n\nPearl's is a tad pricey. My burger, fries, and malt came to 25 dollars which is kind of expensive for a small, hole in the wall burger joint. I guess that since they use Kobe beef and nothing but the freshest ingredients that I really can't complain. This is one of those places that you truly get what you pay for.", "author": "Craig R."}

Great burgers, great shakes, great onion rings and great staff. \n\nI could go on about my deep and abiding love for Pearl's, but the reviews seem to already back me up. Instead, a brief aside...\n\nThey used to serve buffalo meat for just a few bucks more. As of 4 or 5 years ago, it jumped up to $8 for buffalo instead of beef. That's a big ask and it's not backed up by the price you see for ground buffalo at other locations. I understand buffalo hit a supply crisis a while back, and maybe that's not over, but I can't believe buffalo meat today is twice the cost of high quality beef. I hope they revisit this. \n\nBuffalo or not, this place will give you an outstanding burger than can stand toe-to-toe with the best in the business. Five stars.", "author": "Phil D."}

I hadn't planned on a big dinner, but when some friends mentioned going to a favorite burger joint of theirs, how could I possibly ever say no?\n\nSo I went for the Spicy Sly burger. Packed with grilled peppers and onions, as well as a habanero sauce, you'd better be ready for some serious heat if you're going to take down this bad boy.\n\nIt turns out the habanero sauce on this burger is vinegar based, which intensifies the heat of the habanero. The vinegar was perhaps a bit of a turnoff simply because I wasn't expecting it, and there may have been a bit much, but it's hard to complain when you've got grilled peppers and onions everywhere, right?\n\nShared some frings with a friend - they were good. Tried my friend's Oreo shake. Delicious.\n\nI imagine this place gets super busy, but we lucked out and were able to seat 7 people as soon as we ordered.

From the moment that we stepped in the door, it seemed like things were going to go well.  Our order taker took the order quickly and efficiently.  After our order was placed, I decided to take a look at a copy of a the most recent health department findings.  These findings included mouse droppings in a storage area, etc.  I immediately began to reassess our choice of venues.  I tried to put this out of mind and thought that maybe this was a \"one-off\"  situation.  While we were waiting for our order to come up, another order taker, who I assume may have been a manager, began barking at the customers who had previously ordered food.  Our food order came up and we took this verbal abuse of a sign to get out...and fast.\n\nOnce we arrived back at our hotel, we unpacked what we had ordered:   2 deluxe burgers w/ cheese, a large order of fries and an order of onion rings.  With that said, the highlight of the meal was the fries.  The burger was tasteless (no salt, pepper or other herbs) and more than likely was from a box of Sam's precut patties.  The onion rings were burnt and tasted like they had been fried in old oil.  Somehow the fries were cooked properly in the midst of the rest of this culinary chaos.  My bf ended up throwing out at least 1/3 of his burger.  I was thoroughly unimpressed and I have no idea what all the glowing reviews are for.  This visit was the culmination of 5 days of lackluster food in SFO and this was by far the worst.  Where I'm from, burgers may not be super fancy but, they taste good at the very least.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-and-market-houston#query:lankfords", "author": "Mark M."}

Since I was on a road trip in North Cal, I stopped by the lovely Mill Valley for lunch.\n\nHere is how I break it down - \n\nEnvironment: It really is a small place. There are probably 6 tables. Unluckily, most people eat pretty fast so I was able to find a small table. Pearl's is clean but a little dark. Restaurant is unisex and pretty clean as well. (3-star)\n\nStaff: They are pretty friendly and speedy. I noticed they ran out of pickles and asked them if I could have some. The cashier said they would put some more out and within seconds, the bucket was full again. (4-star)\n\nFood: I ordered Pearl's Phat burger (medium rare) with cheese and bacon and a small side of fries. My food arrived within a few minutes and boy! it was PHAT! It was so big it could not fit in my mouth! And the patty was so juicy! It was dripping! Their fries was crispy, fresh, and, hot! Now I understood why Pearl's had been so many people's favorite! Half way through the burger and I was already full but it was so so good so I kept eating till the last bite! I can't wait to go back again!

After all, I have Yelp and Stephanie K. to thank for first discovering Pearl's for me. \n\nA couple years back, my friends asked me where I wanted to celebrate my 23rd birthday.  Having just seen and been visually tormented-and-delighted-at-the-same-time by the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Best Burger in New York,\" I couldn't resist requesting a similar search right here in our beloved little City by the Bay.  \n\nEven with my hyper-inflated birthday expectations, it somehow did not disappoint.  (That's saying something, too, seeing as how I suffer from chronic \"birthday deflation-itis.\"  Happens regularly, once a year or so.)\n\nI've been back maybe a dozen times since, and it always hits the spot.  Except for maybe, in all honesty, one time: when the level of juiciness destroyed my bun.  However, I just can't bring myself to complain that much about a burger being too juicy.  (I really can't...this doesn't count.)\n\nAnd sorry Beatrice T., but I've come here a bunch of times with groups of 5 or 6 people at prime dinner hours, and never had a problem with seating.  The place is small, for sure, but a lot of customers go the takeout route.  Those who do stay and eat are usually pretty good about moving on when done with their food (when there's obviously other people in need of seats).  Probably not the best place to hang out for a 2-hour meal anyway, unless you just really like no-frills/no-booths diner ambiance.  It's not perfect, but the turnover system has worked well enough in my experience.\n\nCan't ask for much more from a burger joint.  The shakes are delicious, and are made with fresh ingredients for each flavor (fresh strawberries = awesome).  And gotta love all those different flavors to choose from.  The fries come out hot and crispy, and the burgers juicy and flavorful.  Extra cool points for offering kobe beef and buffalo burgers.  I mean, cool for meat-eaters.  Sorry to my vegan and veggie friends...all 3 of you.\n\nDear Pearl's, although Mr. Bartley's in Cambridge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-bartleys-burger-cottage-cambridge) has since inexplicably stolen my heart/arteries from you, I'll be a customer as long as you keep up the good work.", "author": "Emmanuel H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-25", "description": "Pearl's is one of my top five burger joints in the city.\nIt is quite possibly the best burger in the city--and the whole bay.  Simply said, they get all the basics for a burger right:\n\n1)  the bun.  must be fresh, toasted, warm.  This is probably equivalent in importance to the actual meat itself because the bun touches your mouth first and is the first texture you feel as you bite down into the burger and chew it.  Pearl's gets it right, toasted, soft, chewy, with sesame seeds on top.  Don't get me started about how often this is screwed up in all the new \"gourmet\" burgers in SF.\n\n2)  the meat.  A good blend of lean meat and fat, cooked to order.  Since Pearl's actually cook it to order most the time, I go with their Bison meat which is leaner and has more flavor than the american kobe which is fatter.  The specialty burgers all have a full 1/2 lb patty which is glorious and very satisfying.\n\n3)  the cheese.  melted and hot on top.  hard to screw this one up.  decent selection of cheese.  I know they have swiss, cheddar, blue, and of course american.\n\n4) veggie condiments.  cold, fresh.  again, most places don't screw this one up.\n\nThe Bula burger is awesome:  swiss cheese melted on a huge burger cooked to order with their homemade spicy pineapple BBQ sauce and a perfectly toasted and fresh bun.   Honestly it's really hard for me NOT to order this here.\n\n The King burger (with a hot dog on top) was good too, but it didn't quite work because the hot dog just slipped right out of the bun when you bit down.  might work better if it was somehow made into a patty or chopped/sliced up.\n\nI should add:  their fries are lightly battered so they are kinda like giant tater tots.  both the regular and sweet potato fries are seriously good.  They may even be double fried because they resemble belgian fries in a way.  And the onion rings are really good too.\n\nPearl's is conveniently located 1 diagonal block from my favorite watering hole, Rye.  so yeah... I go fairly often.  :)", "author": "Fong L."}

Just the right size (cashier mentioned that the mini burgers are 8oz and deluxe are 12oz) and the fries are amazing! Possibly the best fries from a burger joint that I've ever had.

I have no idea how we missed this unassuming establishment for so long. It isn't as fancy as a Sliders or as trendy hip as Umami Burger in the Marina, but it's damn well tastier. \n\nWe hit up the Pearl's in downtown San Francisco on Post and Jones. There are two other locations, one in SOMA and another in Alameda. Pearl's has an assortment of standard burgers as well as some out-of the-ordinary choices like the Bomb Burger, an open faced burger smothered in chili, shredded cheese, and diced onions. I chose the mini-burger (1/4 lb.) as opposed to my husband who chose the Delux (Standard) 1/2lb burger. The burger was absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. Pearl's doesn't offer a \"topping bar\" like Sliders, because the burgers speak for themselves. No need to dress them up. Two points for Pearls also in that they had a bucket of serve yourself pickles on the counter. (Yum) Pearl's also offers fancy burgers like Kobe beef and buffalo meat for almost double the price. \n\nI'd say my second favorite thing about Pearl's besides the delicious burger is that the Post location is right down the street from 2 international hostels. I couldn't figure out if I was in a hostel common room or an actual restaurant in San Francisco. I loved it! Listening to all the hipster travelers brought me back to my good old traveling days. I would probably walk the extra few blocks from our house past Sliders to hit up Pearl's just for the entertaining conversation.", "author": "Alice S."}

I tried the Bula Burger and it was awesome! The burger was delicious and juicy! The burger and a side of frings was so filling, especially since the regular sandwich is a half pounder. The sweet teriyaki pineapple sauce that the beef patty is lathered with definitely tastes as good as everyone raves about and added a nice tangy kick to the burger! Their fries and onion rings were also fantastic - extra crispy and crunchy!\n\nThis place is definitely a neat little spot that isn't too hard to spot when you're walking along Post St. I'd definitely recommend it burger lovers all around!

I was salivating just reading the menu. I decided to order the Phat Bob with a side of garlic fries and a shake. \n\nThe burger: Very savory and the combination of ingredients made for a good meal. But I'm not sure it's worth the $10. It's about 3/4 the size of a Red Robin Burger and doesn't really have any flare. I still think Five Guys makes a better burger. I'd say it was worth $5 at best. \n\nThe fries: Very well cooked, not greasy at all. But good luck getting garlic salt on the fry. The garlic salt comes in clumps and doesn't really stick to the fries. So either you dip your fry in sauce and hope to catch some salt, or you stick a spoon full of the stuff  in your mouth and risk 72hr garlic breath.\n\nThe shake: This is one of the few places I've been to that makes everything with real ice cream and malt.

The bula, simply put is heaven in a bun.\nIt is essentially, Pearl's twist on the Hawaiian burguer! it comes with thick cut bacon, swiss cheese and a pineapple teriyaki sauce. I've got to admit, I'm sucker  for everything Hawaiianish, pineapply, or bacony. Hell, I even love Hawaiian pizza and yes, I don't care to admit it. But this burger is something extraordinary, actually it was named best burger in the Bay Area by Bobby Flay! \nThe onion rings are a bit disappointing. They are cut to thick so they get soggy in the middle, the batter is tasty tho. I don't know  if this is a new thing with the fries or what, but the last time I ordered Frings (french fries and onion rings) the fries came battered just like the onion rings, those were the best fries that I've ever had, super crunchy in the outside and soft in the middle \n\nAsides that, Ive tried the Phat Bob, which is pretty good, but nothing like my bula. The chilli burguer was really good too. They even have a low carb meal that is a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.

After eating a Prized Pearl and onion rings at Pearl's, the napkin carnage was formidable. This is probably the best I've ever had. That title was, until today, probably held by the Rogue Ale House, which offered me a Kobe beef burger that seemed to have it all. Well, it didn't have enough -- and I didn't even opt for the Kobe beef option at Pearl's.\n\nThere is not a single thing that I would change about the Prized Pearl ... well maybe the fact that it left me too full to try the sweet potato fries, one of their milk shakes or any of the other amazing-looking/sounding burgers on the menu.", "author": "Art Q."}

The place is tiny, and the tables are set up for groups of two or so.  When we walked in as a group of 8, one of the guys working there immediately started rearranging all the tables and chairs to accommodate us.  That was super nice of them. \n\n2.  I ordered a mini deluxe with cheese and upgraded it to Kobe beef for an extra $3.99.   After I ordered, paid, and sat down to wait, the cook came out and said that the cashier made a mistake because they could only do Kobe beef upgrades for the regular half-pound burgers.  So, I told them I'd just pay the extra $1.50 to upgrade to a regular burger.  The cook, however, was like, \"It's okay, we'll just upgrade it, no worries!\"  That was SUPER nice of them!  Thank you, Pearl's!\n\nSo, yes.

Let me compare my most recent experience at each restaurant:\n\nBullshead: I got a half pound buffalo burger and a side of fries for $11.25.  It was the sauteed fresh garlic burger, which has sauteed cloves of garlic on top that are subtle and delicious.  The burger was cooked perfectly, and I left happy.  This is how every visit is to Bullshead.\n\nPearl's: I got a half pound buffalo burger for $11.99 (more expensive) and then had to pay $2.99 for some fries.  I asked if they could put garlic on, and they said yes.  They put about two tablespoons of diced raw garlic on, which was overwhelmingly powerful and made the bun garlicky and soggy.  Disgusting.  And the bacon was way too fatty and chewy.  They also included a random bag of extra toppings, which was also a bit soggy.  Why?\n\nI need to learn my lesson and never go back.

What we love the most, however, is their milkshakes. Imagine my chagrin when we were informed last Saturday that the blueberry milkshake was unavailable. We were going to call the Main Street one and check there but ultimately decided against it. No loss there because we just discovered that that location shut down! Anyway, being blueberry milkshake-deprived almost drove me to tears. At least my friend got her Nutella milkshake. Are blueberries out of season or has the flavor been removed from the menu completely? How many other of their flavors have been cut?! The last time I checked, there were a MULTITUDE of milkshake options. Do they only offer vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and Nutella now? Am I making an unreasonable fuss over a milkshake? Perhaps! But I can't even check out the menu because their website is \"under construction\" and unavailable! Pearl's, what is happening to you?! All I wanted was a thick, creamy blueberry milkshake to wash down my Phat Bob...\n\nAnyway, it's a really small place so like 90% of San Francisco be prepared to 1) not find parking (My friends once circled the block while one person ran inside to order and get the food) and 2) not have anywhere to sit. The Main Street location was a lot bigger, but alas, it's gone now. Time to let it go. I'm not quite ready to lose my blueberry milkshake, though. Seriously, is it coming back anytime soon? I've never tasted anything like it anywhere in the world and until I find a substitute it will haunt my dreams. You might as well just call it liquid crack in a paper cup.", "author": "Elle T."}

So, we figured \"sure why not?\" and headed in for something delicious. \n\nI ordered the mini-deluxe with everything and Smoosh got the deluxe without onions. We also got a small side of sweet potato fries. Who doesn't love sweet potatoes and fries? So naturally sweet potato fries caught our interest. The place was pretty small but it got packed quickly. We were lucky when we got in lest we be standing in a line that nearly touched the door.\n\nOur food came quickly. The burgers were good and not greasy. It would have sucked if they were because our trek back to Smoosh's place would have killed us. Mine was cooked how I liked it, well done thank you very much. Smoosh liked his. It was a good burger, not the best, but pretty good. I was disappointed in the sweet potato fries. I felt there needed to be far more seasoning than there was on there. It had the perfect amount of salty goodness but a little bit of kick would have made it kick-ass.\n\nOverall, an ok place.

The sweet potato fries here at Pearl's are crinkle cut fries. They were fried perfectly and taste awesome with ketchup BUT they are on the bland and dry side. Usually, sweet potato fries have more of a taste to it than just being bland like normal fries. I'm used to sweeter sweet potato fries like the ones they serve at Taylors. They're not called SWEET potato fries for no reason! Plus, Taylors serves them on the softer side so you can definitely taste the sweetness of the potato without having it covered up by the crispy fried outside and oil. The only reason I dip my sweet potato fries in ketchup is either because 1) it has no taste or 2) they are too dry. Might I add, I dipped each sweet potato fry from Pearl's in ketchup.\n\nSERVICE\nMy apologies for walking in here 5 minutes before closing and expecting friendly service. The workers were already putting up chairs and preparing to clean up. I should have known they were going to be on the edgy side.\n\nSTRIKE #1\nMy friend: Can I use the bathroom?\nServer: No. It's closed because I already cleaned it. \n(Um...really? No bathroom privileges for PAYING customers?)\n\nSTRIKE #2\nServer: What can I get for you?\nMe: An order of the sweet potato fries, please!\nServer: Ok. Anything else.\nMe: Nope. Oh and to-go too, thanks.\nServer: Everything at this hour is to-go. \nMe: Uh..ok.\nServer: DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT ANYTHING. LAST CALL. HELLO? ANYTHING? \n(We all stared at him like he was nutso and proceeded to shake our heads...)\n\nCan I say RUDE?? In this economy, where people are penny pinching like crazy, any business should be GLAD to have customers come in even at the last minute. If you close at 2am, you should close at 2am, not 1:55am. I was mildly turned off by this and the more and more I think about it, the more and more I want to rule out coming to Pearl's ever again.

This burger makes me shrug my shoulders at the thought of having a triple bypass heart surgery. This burger is topped with big crispy onion rings, thick slabs of bacon and warm, drippy BBQ sauce. The burger is pink in the middle which makes my lady lips quiver. I am an average sized chick but I can take this burger to the face.

It's great that they serve Niman Ranch beef, Kobe beef and buffalo (I've tried it all from here), but from my experiences the burgers have really lacked that distinct beefy flavor and juiciness we meat eaters enjoy and love.

And I guess you could consider the patty to be juicy...but I just saw it as really greasy.  And it was kind of disgusting as the bun had sopped up most of the grease by the time I had took a bite out of it.  \n\nMy friends got the spicy sly burgers and they seemed to enjoy them.  I also tried the onion rings and I felt that they too were just alright.  Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy a good burger but the food here is nothing to write home about.  I'm not exactly tempted to go back but I'm willing to give it another shot considering all the rave reviews.  I'd probably try their award-winning burger (the bula?) which I had missed on the menu the first time around.  Hopefully the damage to my heart will be worth it.", "author": "Jen N."}

Not sure why, but was expecting it to look a little fancier.\n\nChecked my to go order quickly before driving off (a must anywhere nowadays) and actually spent more time looking for a place to park and eat than I did getting my food.  Upon opening the two cartons, was impressed with the size and appearance of my half-pound burger.  Nice!!!!  Is what I said when I first took it out of the container and held it up.  Looked so impressive that I wondered if people walking by would notice it like they did when I had that cheesesteak from Jake's.  Or like the time in my car when I had a big falafel wrap from Oasis (the best in SF!) and some guy walking by said, \"WOW, look at that burrito!\"  Would it perhaps incite a little burger envy?\n\nAnyway, the bacon was a little underdone and there were stringy portions of fat that I had to tear off, but overall, I really liked my burger.  It was really good.  Wasn't a religious experience, but hey, this was just their base burger with cheese and bacon.  Next time, I will try the grass-fed or most likely their Kobe beef version.  The Bula looks real good.\n\nAlso ordered 'Frings' (half fries/half onion rings) in which the 'rings' were a tangled battered mess, but actually tasted pretty good.  Wish there had been more of them though...less fries would have been okay as that was a generous portion.\n\nIn the end, I couldn't believe I finished it all and was really, really full.

Fresh buns made fresh daily by a local bakery and produce so fresh you would swear they had a garden out back. We both tried Pearls Deluxe burger  (first thing on the menu) the FIRST time we went (because we went twice in five days).  We added bacon and cheddar cheese. Fries were hot and crispy. Second time we went we left off the bacon but had the \"frings\" Half french fries half onion rings-- wished we'd gotten just the rings this time as they were perfect-- crunchy and delicious and the coating didn't fall off with the first bite. For two burgers one large order of fries and two drinks we spent around $29 and change and didn't feel the least ripped off. Big burgers, generous portion of fries (and rings) and two drinks -- not bad for SF. The guys behind the counter were very friendly. The only problem is there are only three tables and some seating by the window. This is s must-try place if you're in the Union Square area.", "author": "Nancy H."}

I was kinda overhyped for this party ya know?  \n(burger looked/smelled good, fairly average in flavor/quality/size)\n\nThe venue was \"meh\", it was in that crappy warehouse like kind of near Oakland Chinatown under the freeway.  So, way sketchy.  Jackie's car wasn't even very flier'ed up so you know that's ghetto.  Not a lot of room, no place to puddle or chill.  and hot!

It was greasy without being revolting, I asked for a medium burger and that's what I got and the toppings were fresh. My only complaint is that the bun, while tasty, ceased to resemble a bun after a few bites. The whole thing just fell to crap. Don't think that deterred me, though.

The burger juices are so vividly unique and tasty it is as fine like a choir of angels figure skating on the ice doing open axels with trumpets flaring.

You pay upfront and then they bring out your order. The specialty burgers were 8.99 while the basic 1/2 lb burger is 6.49. Cheese is 50 cents and bacon is +$1. They also have a mini burger option. Any variety of fries are 4.99 each.\n\nI got the regular with bacon and I have to say it was quite juicy as with every bite, little bits of juice and grease dripped out. \n\nI also tried the springs (sweet potatoe fries + onion rings) and I have to say they were above average. Its big enough to share with another person. The onion rings were battered just enough while the yam fries were cooked correctly.\n\nOverall I would have to say its the best place to get a burger in San Francisco although my friend says the one at the cheese cake factory is better. I will be the judge of that.", "author": "Robert Y."}

I'm really a fan of the Spicy Sly. I like that it's actually spicy, and I suspect that it's made with a sauce made with pumpkin seeds. I also like that you can taste things other than \"heat.\" It's a VERY wet burger, so get a stack of napkins. This is my favorite so far: the Bula Burger and Prize Pearl didn't really do it for me.\n\nOh and don't be an asshole and reserve a table. There are only 13 seats in this restaurant and you should yield tables to people in line before you. The turn around is pretty quick, so you won't be waiting long.

Along with an order of small fries which is fairly large and a large soda (I was really, really thirsty when I walked in.) I found myself in a serious food coma.\n\nEven though it is posted on the menu board I failed to see that Pearl's burgers are cooked medium unless otherwise requested.  So I accepted my burger medium for a change.  I had ordered a Deluxe with bacon and no cheese or onions.  The burger patty was very good with good beef flavor, but the bacon wasn't cooked as crispy as I would have liked; in fact the fatty portion of the bacon was still quite chewy.  Between the grease from the burger and the bacon, the moisture from the lettuce and tomato and a thin film of mayonnaise the bottom bun disintegrated in a greasy, drippy mess.  \n\nThe long, meaty fries were fried up golden crispy.  One thing did catch my eye on the menu, which stated that an all-natural Beef Patty could be substituted for an additional charge.  Does that mean there was something unnatural about my burger?\n\nFor such a tiny restaurant the menu is pretty extensive.  Quarter pound options as well as buffalo, turkey or vegetable burgers, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs and salads are also available.  I'm pretty certain I'll return as their Spicy Sly Chicken sandwich sounded quite good.  They have lots of milkshake options too, but I was out of Lactaid tablets at the time.

There are only 6 or so tables, and a few stool seats.\n\nThe burgers are big and juicy, with lots of options.  Me, being the so called \"Bacon King\", had a bacon and swiss burger with garlic fries.  There are \"special burgers\" too, that add mushrooms, and other things.  I stick with the basics.  The regular burgers are 1/3 pound, I think, while the Deluxe weigh in at 1/2 pound.  It was cooked as ordered, a good Medium Rare.  They are pretty messy, but napkins are at your table, so feel free to get your hands greasy.  A \"natural patty\" can be had, but it looks like only for the \"special burgers\" for about $1.25 more.\n\nThe garlic fries were very good, but a little over salted.  I would prefer to add my own salt.  The drinks are self serve, which is a plus, because you never know how much you can drink.  Shakes are available, but I did not order one.  That is the only way I eat ice cream ... and it's a rare occasion when I do.\n\nCheck it out, but don't plan on finding a place to park.  Cheap ... my meal cost about $11.00.  Not bad when you consider some places across town charge that much just for the fries.  OH ... you want a burger with that too?  Another $20 please ...  You won't regret stopping by Pearl's, for all you burger fanatics!\n\nSecond visit!  Tonight, I had the Prized Pearl, natual beef.  This one has blue cheese, sauteed onions, and bacon.

I also noticed they had onion rings and asked the owner if they were any good. He said he didn't like onion rings, but he likes these ones. I mean what else is he going to say - right?! So I said as long as they were not battered then let's do this...\n\nSo when I got my burger I was a little confused. So being a natural beef place the burger kinda looked as if a pre-made patty. The cheese was a little bit too melted and so it was like a yellow coating on a pre-made patty. Everything else looked in place, except I must add that the bun they used was a whole lot of bread for a burger bun. more bun than burger, which leads me to say - Where's the BEEF!!! So then I was kicking myself not ordering the Kobe burger, cuz maybe that would be a whole different experience.\n\nOn to the onion rings... not fully battered, but still battered w/ a few mixed in crumbs... ugh... or maybe not quite breaded but a whole lot of holes going on in the breading...

I downed that burger so fast, that I finished before my friend even went through half of her mini-sized burger. Yaa, it was that good.\n\nOne of the best burger places I've been so far.

I had Kobe beef Burger which is $4.00 extra but more than worth it. Bread was fresh, cheese was Excellent and I will be a regular. Its a small joint, not a restaurant,  but it is worth it even if u have to wait for a table to Hope\n They are friendly and courteous which is rare these days. I have not had their regular beef Burger, but my roommate (boyfriend/significant other) has and said it was equally as good, but its worth the extra four bucks to upgrade.

The spicy pineapple teriyaki sauce is the headliner, separating it from its peers of other specialty burgers. The sauce has a perfect blend of spice & sweetness. The thick layer of bacon accentuates the greatness of the Bula. It's messy, juicy, and cooked to perfection. \n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat, especially if you're a burger lover. Whereas some burger joints underwhelm on providing \"deluxe\" burgers, this joint truly earns it's title. The place is small, so it may be tough to find a spot during prime lunch and dinner hours, but you can always get it to go. Also, it's now cash only, so come prepared.", "author": "Reid T."}

But when cutie-pie and super-prego Honolulu community manager Emi H mentioned that she was really craving burgers, fries, and a shake - now, how could I resist?\n\nAnd all I hafta say is: OMG! All that hype is true. Pearl's doesn't look like much from the exterior, and I was potentially frightened off by the lack of seating when we arrived, but luckily window seats opened up while we were placing our (massive) orders. Don't go here expecting veggie burgers, my friends, although if you've somehow lost your mind feel free to order a salad or a chicken burger. You just have to indulge in every possible sin, including a juicy burger with all the toppings, fried things, and thick shakes. I sampled the bacon cheese burger, sweet potato fries and a chocolate peanut butter shake. And by sampled, I mean sampled, because this was way too much food for me. A little advice: order a mini (1/4 burger) and split a fry with your friends and it will be plenty, I swear. Take the shake to go and try to stuff it in your mini fridge for a midnight snack. \n\nMake sure you know what you're ordering before you get to the counter - size, toppings and type. I made the newb error of changing my order midway through, and they had to re-ring me in. They did it with a smile, but I swear I spotted people rolling their eyes in line behind me.\n\nI'm sure someday soon I'll be able to resist the lure of the burger.

I went there to pick up my food and I didn't check the food. I just left the place with my order.

I had the Bula Burger and some of my friend's Phat Bob Burger:\n\n1.   Bula Burger- I was expecting more from the spicy pineapple teriyaki sauce that comes with the burger.  I liked the sauce, but I wish I could have tasted more of the pineapple because that was the only thing that seemed to be lacking in the flavoring.  The burger as a whole was pretty good though, the patty was thick and soft, and the gooey cheese was great.\n\n2.   Phat Bob Burger- It reminded me of a Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr., but better.  The patty was supposed to be cooked medium, but it was quite pink in the middle, but I didn't mind because I like medium-rare meat.  The burger overall was decent.\n\nNote: I didn't like the way they prepared the bacon in either of the burgers.  For burgers, I like the bacon to be crispy and they can break into pieces/fracture off easily.  Instead, the bacon was not cooked as long, so it was still a little tough, which is not really my style.\n\nOverall, the burgers themselves were pretty good.  The decor and the space available in the restaurant were kind of turn offs because it was kind of cramped, dirty, and uncomfortable.  So in addition to that plus the bacon, there is the -1 star.

Someone's obviously put a lot of thought into the menu, where you'll find gourmet-ish upgrades like buffalo burgers and natural beef (for an extra $1.25-$1.50) and seasonal fresh-fruit shakes, alongside frat-boy gutbombs like a hamburger that comes with a hot dog on top!\r\n\r\nThe place is clean and crisp, without feeling sterile. Service at the counter was on the ball, and the prices seemed in line with similar joints: We paid a bit more than $20 for the two of us. You could see the fresh fruit for shakes in pourable containers in a little fridge near the register, and everyone backstage looked like they knew what the hell they were doing. They even offered frings, so I didn't have to choose between two equally appealing options... sa-weet.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I was so distracted by the surprise fries-with-rings option that I didn't specify what kind of cheese I wanted on my Pearl's Deluxe, so I got some particularly nasty American technicolor-orange stuff. The theoretical 1/2-pound patty was flat, obviously machine-made, and tasted downright industrial. It came with a decent, but obviously store-bought bun, plus nice leafy lettuce, cardboardy tomato, and sliced onions. The meat was cooked to medium --- as they said it would be by default --- but tasted manky enough that I don't think I'd dare order it again.\r\n\r\nMy husband wisely opted for the natural-beef upgrade on his mushroom-bacon burger; his Jack cheese tasted a little less processed than the American, the 'shrooms were good (although they paled in comparison to those at Joe's Cable Car), and the patty looked like it had been formed by human hands. Unfortunately, they'd cooked the living daylights out of it. Medium? Nononono... this poor patty was scorched to fare-thee-well-done. Still, it remained reasonably juicy and definitely worthy of another try.\r\n\r\nHow 'bout those sides? Both fries and rings were from a bag, but actually tasted like someone had bothered to find the best premade versions they could get, rather than the cheap, sugar-coated nasties you find most places. Similarly, a vanilla malt --- although made with soft-serve ice cream --- was actually creamy and malty, without the gloppy texture you ususally find with extruded dairy.\r\n\r\nWould I go back? Probably, yeah. But I'll stick with the natural beef, make sure to specify real cheese, and ask for my burger to be cooked medium-rare.", "author": "anita c."}

I was enticed by the thought of juicy burgers and crispy sweet potato fries....... and the fact that they have the word DELUXE in their name.\n\nI ordered the Pearls Deluxe Burger with American cheese, while my sister got the Phat Bob. In addition, we wanted the strawberry milkshake and spries (half sweet potato, half french fries order)! The total ended up being around ~$25, which is not bad. The cashier was being really informative and kept repeating everything I ordered, even when I wasn't done, just to be sure. I thought that was funny because we kept talking over each other by accident.\n\nThe deluxe burger (no mayo) was really juicy! The juices were seriously dripping down the side of my hands and it spread all over my face. Other than the fact that the beef was nicely cooked, it tasted like an average burger. The Phat Bob, though....... mmmm. I could taste the heart attack. Sadly, these specials didn't come with lettuce and tomato, so the Phat Bob was just a meat+bun kind of thing. Nevertheless, it was delicious.\n\nAnother thing that I liked was the spries. This order gets its own paragraph. It was so crispy and I could not stop eating them! It was the highlight of my meal... I knew the sweet potato fries were going to be delicious, but the regular fries were surprisingly tasty.  I saved half of them to eat later, and they were still crunchy!", "author": "Karen L."}

Pearl's cooks their patty's medium (unless otherwise specified) and personally, I loved my beef cooked medium, but, I next time I would ask for it to be cooked medium-well because the medium part of the patty had a weird taste to it that made me gag a bit. I also thought that the patty wasn't seasoned well, it tasted bland and I had to turn to the salt shaker to excite my taste buds.\n\nI ordered the Avocado burger and replaced ranch for pesto. Upon biting the burger, my taste buds didn't go crazy; my eyes didn't bulge and I didn't let out an exaggerated \"Mmm!!!\" (which is a clear sign that whatever I was eating was mediocre). If you do love avocados, this is your burger because they are not stingy at all with it; they give you about half of an avocado! \n\nWe ordered Spries (Sweet Potato fries and French fries) and they were delicious, the portion was satisfying as well.\n\nWe also had an Oreo shake which was absolutely delicious! It didn't have that thick consistency to it like I expected. I was also disappointed because it came in a regular soda cup and didn't have that extra refill tin cup.\n\nAll in all, we payed $28.00 for two burgers, a side of Spries, and an Oreo Shake (which I think is a bit pricey).\n\nAlthough my burger didn't WOW me, I'll definitely be back to try out the other options.", "author": "Juliette R."}

I honestly am perfectly happy with the \"basic\" Nieman Ranch, but knock yourself out if you feel like it.\n\nThey have awesome fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings, and you can get different combos if you like (ie. frings, springs,spries). Make sure to load up on ranch for your dipping pleasure as well.\n\nWhile seating is limited and the ambiance is not the most amazing, it doesn't even matter! The food more than makes up for the fluorescent lighting!!!\n\nMy personal favorite order: Pearl's Deluxe Burger with bacon and bleu cheese, with a side of frings (fries & onion rings) and a diet coke (you know, because I'm OBVIOUSLY on a diet).\n\nAnd yes, I do eat here once a week. I am engaging in an ongoing courtship with Pearl's Deluxe Burgers.", "author": "Felicity M."}

Some friends and I came here on a busy Friday night and we ordered burgers for each of us and spries (sweet potato fries and regular fries), frings (onion rings and regular fries), and garlic fries, just to sample them all. To our surprise! They were all soggy! Sad to say, the much raved about sweet potato fries were horrible, they tasted like mashed sweet potatoes because of the lackluster texture. Now on to the burgers\n\nOh lalala! The burgers! So I ordered the Prized Pearl - a enormous burger with bacon, carmelized onions, and blue cheese! MHMMMMM! Is all I could say for at least 10 minutes! I loved how the strong taste of the blue cheese went with the natural flavor of the burger. It was AMAZING! \n\nConclusion:\n- Burgers are phenomenal!

The big problem is that here's nothing personal or local about the place to make me want to champion it.\n\nI had a bacon cheeseburger, and like others have noted, the bun was not stellar. I think the problem is that the ingredients here are highly processed, so the bun is lacking flavor or texture (it will fall apart and be a big mess). The meat is molded into a form (at least mine seemed to be) and seems to inevitably dry out. Mine was so dry I had to keep adding mustard and ketchup. They probably need to hit these burgers with some kind of special sauce or Worcestershire or something to keep them moist if they are always this dry. The fries are fake with lots of artificial seasoning, etc. I did enjoy the onion rings, but again they are clearly not made fresh but dumped from freezer to fryer and made who knows where. Again, all that is fine if you're on a budget and on the go, but the decor and environment and details of the joint don't really inspire you to buy into the place like an In & Out Burger or similar chain grabs you. It's just another reiteration of a fake diner, and let's be honest: who really cares about diners anymore except baby boomers? They need some pizazz or a clever gimmick if they're going to really make it, IMHO. If your focus isn't quality ingredients made for the community (see Burgerville in the Pacific Northwest), you're going to need something novel to stand out as a budding chain. \n\nHowever... bonus points for having a big container of decent-quality pickles that you can take at your leisure.

It's super lean, and just tastes...FRESH! No grease or anything dripping from it-- I guess that's what \"organic\" tastes like. \n\nThey have Kobe beef, Buffalo meat, chicken and even veggie burgers. Although-- I don't know why'd you come here if you were a vegetarian. \n\nThe little man is right, it is very clean inside--very small, but very clean. The staff is really nice, just like he said. I ordered a specialty burger not knowing it didn't come w/ produce, and when I asked for it after my burger already came out-- there was no hesitation. The worker came back out in 2 minutes w/ a basket full of lettuce, onions and tomatoes. \n\nAnyway-- I guess I'm just confirming that everything that man says in the video is true! This place is the spot to go to for a DELICIOUS FRESH burger accompanied by a friendly staff!!

Ah yes....because of Pride weekend and all the  cars that jam packed the main street, it took us sooo long to get to this place.  My sister and I went to get pedicures in the Glen Park area.  I told her that my friend told me about this burger spot and that we had to try it and on top of that I added that I had yelped it and said that they were going to be on the food channel soooooo it was a must to try!  \n\nSo just before leaving Glen Park I called in an order of large sweet potato fries and a spicy sly burger.  He said it will be ready in 8 minutes!  Great, so I head down to the city from Glen Park not even thinking that there was going to be traffic...why? LOL I have no clue.  So I get off of Civic Center and headed towards 12th St. to get on Van Ness, *bam* 50 feet in 10 minutes.  I had to get out of there...turn around go down 7th street to get to the Tenderloin that way and once I get to Howard....blocked off!  I thought to myself, wow this must be a sign that I should just turn around and go home. Ha yah right, I was determined and restrategized....hopped back onto 101N and exited Octavia and traveled parallel to Van Ness hit a right on Post and tada!!! Victory in 45 minutes.  \n\nMy sister had called Pearls to let them know we were stuck in traffic and they were A-Ok with it.  We were thinking, 'oh great our burger and fries is gonna be cold!'  I put my hazards on and sent my sister on in to get it.  We were sooo hungry that we just pulled into a spot on Jones to chow down.

To know you is to know an isotope of perfection, rare and elusive but, once there, forever at your side even if only in memory.\n\nI, a child of the land which idolizes the unhealthiest of sandwiches, the land which worships the German transplant that is the burger by taking it to new heights of innovation and glorious excess...I have eaten many specimens of this food both foul and excellent. I have eaten ones for a dollar, and for twenty. It is not my favorite nourishment by any stretch of the imagination, but as a culinary archetype I believe it to be one of the finer points in life. Especially when taken together with accoutrements such as fries, onion rings, and shakes. Great happiness lies within these things.\n\nAnd so, preconceived notions of what characterizes a burger done well firmly in hand, I finally made the brief trip and ordered a bula (regular beef) with a basket of springs. The universe at this moment rends itself in two and here I am, in some place unknowable and beautiful. The patty is succulent and flavorful. The bacon is crisp and aromatic. The sauce a festival of tang and spice with terriyaki umame. I ask, what is the definition of luck? And perhaps somewhere in the dictionary it says, \"Living four blocks down the street, however briefly, from Pearl's Deluxe Burgers.\"\n\nI'm spent just thinking about all this, reliving the springs (perfect combination of sweet potato fries and onion rings) and the exquisite mess of a half-pound honest-to-goodness-great bacon cheeseburger with sauce. Their chicken...also incredible, of course. The staff...yeah, super nice and quick too.\n\nYou can spend $15 easily if you splurge on trimmings and upgrade on your meat. If you like burgers, you will consider the cost to be trivially worth it. You will be fatter, but happier.\n\nPlease come here, and try it for yourself.", "author": "Peter B."}

(and sorry about the mess we left...)\n\nSaturday night, about 20 of us crowded into Pearl - get this - with a styrofoam case of cold beers to celebrate the birth of a lovely friend named Amy.  And hey, the birthday girl wanted to have cheeseburgers for her special day, and she was definitely going to have it her way!\n\nThese guys were SO fantastically, incredibly accomodating to our loud, obnoxious party, and even handed Amy a $20 gift certificate when I thought they for sure would have booted us as soon as we started poppin' those beers open... (seeing as how they don't have a liquor license, and we basically broke the law that night.)\n\nThe burgers were scrumptous - I ordered a 1/4 lb cheeseburger (no onions, thanks).  Loaded on the ketchup and mustard and had my way with it.  Split the sweet potato fries (which are crinkle cut!) and tried some french fries as well.  Fries were yummy, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  Pretty solid.  Though, I will note that they overcooked the meat a tad - I asked for \"medium\" and it pretty much came well-done.  Nonetheless, it was a juicy, flavorful, satisfying cheeseburger, which I scarfed down.\n\nI overlooked the Kobe beef option, which apparently you can request for about $4 more.  Perhaps next time.  The rest of the party seemed to really enjoy their burgers, so - thumbs up all around.\n\nOf course - what's a party without some cake?! And a \"princess cake\" at that.  Yes - we brought our own cake. plates. knives. candles that sparkled and relit themselves when blown out.  Of course, we shared a slice with the man who worked there as a thank you gesture (and apology).  \n\nMan, I'm giving this place 4 stars for the food ...and 5 stars for not kicking us out that night...", "author": "Christine Y."}

Very small but the atmosphere is really cool, the people behind the counter are cool and the burgers here are real, real good.  Mine was real messy and juicy.  I can't remember the exact name but it was the fairly common combination of onion rings, bacon, bbq and cheese.  What's even better is the crazy flavors they have for Milkshakes that sadly you don't find at too many establishments.  After I devoured my burger, I ordered a peanut-butter and chocolate shake for the road.  I could barely drive straight this thing was so good.  Eyes kept rolling into the back of my head.

In the two times that I've been here, I've ordered the Bula Burger and the Pesto Burger. Although an insane mess, the Bula Burger is definitely one of the best burgers I've had in SF -- one of these days I'm going to get that with the Kobe beef because I'm sure the meat would be a lot more juicy & tender. The Pesto Burger, on the other hand, was pretty bland -- I really wish there was more pesto in there and maybe some roasted garlic would've made it great. \n\nLove the sweet potato fries. Krinkle cut, soft sweet potato fries. Awesome.\n\nI give this place 4 stars because the burgers are definitely some of the best in SF, but only if you order the right ones.

I travel all over and I like to try the best burgers around whenever I get the chance. Here in San Francisco... Pearls was that burger. I would get the pearls deluxe with bacon as often as I flossed my teeth which is daily. It was always an amazing treat. I like my burger to taste like a burger so I ordered it medium rare always, and it WAS always spot on. \nAbout 6 months ago I went and ordered my medium rare pearls deluxe, and as I took a bite I noticed it was definitely medium cooked. \"Oh well\" I thought to myself... \"We all make mistakes\". I went again a few weeks later and BAM same thing. This time it could have almost been considered medium well which made me wildly unhappy. This happened about 4 or 5 more times with the same result. What happened to my beloved Pearls??? Then they went ahead and changed their weekend closing time from 2am to 10pm which really put my in a tail spin one night...\nTonight I decided to give them another try... \"Listen I love your burgers, but lately Iv'e been ordering medium rare burgers and they come out medium. So I'm going to ask you to cook it rare, but please I don't want a raw burger... I just want a lot of pink like medium rare\" I said to the cash register dude. For half a second he acted like he understood, and went on with his work. About 30 seconds later my burger was ready. \"That can't be good\" I thought, but I thought the burger gods would be on my side. Right when I took a bite i knew it... RAW BURGER! It looked like it was on the grill for less time than a piece of sushi. It truly was not edible, even by my standards. Then I decided after 6 months of this... They have earned a horrible review. \nThere has definitively been a change in management and it seems the current staff has totally let quality control go out the window.

I have found my go-to place for burgers in SF! \n\nWent there on a Saturday afternoon at 1:30 and there was still a line! I ordered the mini bacon cheese burger and its was everything I dreamed of. Juicy burger cooked to medium, gooey cheese, crunchy bacon, fresh tomato slice, crisp lettuce, and light mayo on a toasted sesame seed bun. Every bite was perfect. I hate burgers where the patty is too small or too big and the cheese, bread, veggie ratio is off. Not at Pearl's! Dlish! The mini burger was the size of a normal burger so it was perfect for me...can't imagine trying to eat a regular one by myself! \n\nUnfortunately, I didnt try their famous shakes but now I'll have another reason to go back!

I was staying in Union Square and wanted something within walking distance. Pearl's on Post st. was just a few blocks away from the hotel. Thanks to yelp I found out about this amazing place. Its size is small and it was hard to find a seat sometimes but the food more than made up for it.\n\nWOW. I was in SF for three days and ate here three times. It was that good. First time I went I had the Prized Pearl which was mouthwatering. It had blue cheese, onions, bacon, and mayo. It was to die for. Perfect tenderness in the patty, grilled to perfection (medium rare) and tons of flavor. I also ordered the sweet potato fries which were excellent. They appeared to be fresh cut and were salted perfectly.\n\nOn my second visit I had the phat bobb with a peanut butter chocolate shake. The burger was, again, outrageously good. Yet the shake was even better (if possible) tons of flavor and perfect thickness. It was a party in my mouth!\n\nThird time around prized pearl again and a nutella shake, the shake was great yet again. I wish this place was located in my hometown but I guess its a good thing that it is 2000 miles away so I don't eat here daily and gain twenty pounds!\n\nSpectacular, definitely the best burger I have ever had.", "author": "G K."}

I hate burger joints where their buns overwhelm the patty. I ordered the deluxe mushroom burger and onion rings. The key to a great burger is to melt the cheese correctly and obviously to cook the burger right. You know how some places just place a slice of cheese on the patty and they don't leave it on the grill long enough on the grill to let it melt? Well.........you won't have that problem here. It was melted correctly. \n\nThe burger was cooked perfectly. It was juicy, the buns were toasted, the mushrooms and cheese were a great compliment. Added some tobasco, ketchup, mustard, and black pepper and this was close to heaven. The onion rings however wasn't that good. The batter wasn't fluffy. It fell apart and it just looked like it needed help. \n\nIt's tough to find parking here but they do open til 2 am on Fridays and Saturdays. If you are craving a burger late at night on the weekends, then this might be a great spot to check out. I really can't compare this to In and Out burger, Burger King, or McDonald's.

By the time 7PM rolled around and I was leaving work, I still hadn't eaten a bite of food all day long.  So on my walk back up to Nob Hill, I took a different route home, and as I rounded the corner of Post Street, my burger senses started tingling.  Yes, I smelled that beautiful beefy grill aroma and followed it until I arrived at Pearl's.\n\nTo get a good sampling of what Pearl's had to offer, I decided on a mini deluxe burger and an order of springs (sweet potato crinkle fries and onion rings).  My thought after the first bite of the burger?  OH HECK YES!  Their meat is extremely juicy--not greasy--and cooked consistently all the way through.  The bun was also really soft and fluffy which I liked, because nothing is worse than eating a burger sandwiched between two bricks.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were out of this world amazing, and I think I might go get them again tomorrow for lunch.  When you get them, don't even think of disgracing them with ketchup or vinegar.  They can stand on their own don't need to be insulted like that :)  The onion rings were also great, but nothing could compare to those sweet potato fries.\n\nWhile I was eating, I also observed a first-time Pearl's eater having an explosion of foodgasms from the buffalo burger.  I thought someone was going to have to mop that poor guy off the floor before he could finish it.   He was honestly ready to combust from food-induced pleasure.  Apparently that buffalo is some good stuff.\n\nOther random things I like about Pearl's:  The employees are super friendly.  They conveniently put all of their condiments up on the counter, and they have lots of dill pickle spears in a tub, so you can take a few as you please to go with your food.  The little dine-in area is nice and breezy when the front window is open (great for warm afternoons).  And last but not least, the burger I order here is $4.29 while the one I like at Taylor's is $8.

We were surprised at how small the place was, and that it didn't off that much seating. Since it was after the \"Lunch Hour Rush\" we were able to get a large table shortly after ordering. 2 of us had just a regular cheese burger and the other had a veggie burger and we split a large order of fries. We can honestly say it was by far one of the tastiest (and juiciest) burgers I've had in aeons and the fries were to die for. I asked the owner how he was able to get his fries to be so crunchy, and he said he uses a special \"proprietary\" type of oil, which keeps them crispy and not limber for a while after they cool. What amazed me was that he and all the staff kept asking us how everything was and always checked on us, even though it wasn't the kind of thing that we expected. What made our experience even more special, was that the owner (forgot his name) asked all the patrons if we'd like to have a complimentary cup of coffee, as he was going to get rid of the coffee and didn't want to \"waste\" it. I thought that was genuinely kind and thoughtful. You just don't find that kind of service and caring anymore. I give this place a 10 rating hands-down!", "author": "Timothy L."}

So after reading the 4 and 5 star reviews I was ecstatic to walk into Pearl's.\n\nThey cook burgers \"medium\" unless you ask otherwise.  I said I wanted mine medium RARE, leaning closer to rare than to medium.  The vapid dude at the counter grunted and entered something into the computer.\n\nWhat I got was medium WELL. The patty is flat and flavorless.  Salt is NOT a flavor!   Their burgers all look impressive when they come out, largely because they pile on a lot of \"stuff,\" and the bun itself is chubby (but tasteless and doughy, a step above buns from Safeway)\n\nThe bacon on mine was generous, but it was barely cooked, and the the pieces which were cooked were sort of half cooked/half not cooked.  That gets a loud EWWWW out of me.\n\nThe grilled onions taste like they were cooked yesterday.\n\nThe batter of onion rings was a big yawn with no flavor.  Absolutely not calorie worthy.\n\nCall me crazy but I thought they'd make their own ketchup or offer something really good.  I thought they'd have good mustard.  What's on the table is a mystery - both are in opaque squeeze bottles with no brand name.  The mustard is likely Frenches (they do not offer anything better) and the ketchup is probably el cheapo from Costco, laden with high fructose corn syrup and other horrible things.    \n\nThe fries are not house cut/made, they are the usual frozen things you expect from a place which does not use grass fed meat.\n\nWhich brings me to their meat.  Snarky McSnark at the counter got into a snit when I said that Estancia from Uruguay is hardly \"sustainable\" since the stuff comes up the George W Bush Memorial Super Highway from South America . . . Snark Boy pointed to a poster on the wall and told me to read the Estancia propaganda.   Puh-leeze, he must encounter a lot of gullible and stupid people, which I am not. I was all set to enlighten the unenlightened with resources for purchasing California grown grass fed meat, but I realized I was trying to talk to someone who's drunk some bad Kool Aid which dissolved any desire for facts and common sense.\n\nNiman Ranch is barely acceptable to people like myself (and I hope you too) and I've had faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar better Niman Ranch burgers at Tower Burger than the thing I was served today at Pearl's.

Cheeseburgers are not just filling, but it's \"comfort food\" to me.  I'm not a snob about what kind of burger I have - - everything from my specific \"special\" burger from Mickey D's (quarter pounder w/ cheese with no ketchup, no pickles, no mustard, only onions) or one of life's greatest inventions: the double double from In N Out.... all the way to a $20 burger from Epic.... I love 'em all!  Some burgers I do not like come from Burger King and Carl's Jr. but even then, I'm not unhappy eating one of them - - I just miss Wendy's is all.\n\nNow, I should explain that this was a take-out order.  So, it did have to survive on its own for about 6 minutes prior to my taking it out of its misery.  \n\nI specifically requested no ketchup... and no pickles.  \nI do not believe in ketchup.  You put ketchup on anything and all you taste is ketchup.  There aren't many things in life I hate - - but ketchup is definitely at the top of that short list.  Whenever I see someone dunk their otherwise delicious food in ketchup - - I make a mental note to never trust that person's food recommendations.  Seriously!\n\nI order my burger w/ the option of cheddar cheese.\n\nThe first bite was pretty good.  It had a nice big bun that was soft - - a big patty and a healthy dose of onions, tomatoes, and I spotted a piece of lettuce that was totally wilted but hey, like I said, it was takeout order.  This is forgivable!\n\nBased on these reviews, I expected to be wowed, but it just never happened!  Looking at the burger, I expected wonderful things to happen to me for the next 4.1 minutes.  \n\nWhat I did NOT like and don't consider directly related to the 6 minute wait was that either the cook forgot to use salt, or he feels about salt the way I do about ketchup.  I worship salt, so this was the first ding.  The beef was dead already, but he killed it completely by cooking it without salt.... and that cow died in vain.  No flavor.  \nI have certain expectations of cheese.  I love cheese.  I like it melted on a burger - it makes a plain burger fabulous -  but I don't like it when cheese melts into OIL.... it should melt in a gooey fashion but maintain a consistency and color that is reminiscent of \"CHEESE\".  This cheese melted into a semi-clear oily covering on the beef - - and left nothing to taste.  Combine this with the lack of salt, and basically, I tasted nothing but tomatoes, bun, and wilted lettuce.\n\nDue to it being so big, and not very flavorful, I started to take the thing apart and ripped off the buns, took off the cheese, took out the melted lettuce and then decided only to eat the meat.  Taking one bite into the meat, I noted that the texture of the beef was not what I'd expect of real ground beef.  That's not to say it was fake beef, but it was definitely a pre-made patty that one buys in bulk - - just a different texture than what I'd expect from a freshly made burger from a restaurant.\nWith no salt or pepper.\n\nThe entire burger was also incredibly oily and watery.  Now I love fat and oil more than most, but don't I simply don't need it, mixed with water from a frozen patty, dripping from my fresh burger in a continuous stream. \n\nI was just under-impressed on the whole.  \nWhat was even worse, though, was the onion rings.  These onion rings were SO bad that they made Burger King look like a 3-star Michelin restaurant.\n\nThat said - -  this place makes some fresh and BEAUTIFUL fries.  I like my fries big, a bit crispy on the outside, and  completely SOFT on the inside.  Pearl's made it exactly that way - - it was lovely, and the texture was perfect  - - - but as expected, it could have used some.... \n\nSALT!!!!!\n\nI MIGHT try a buffalo burger one day and order it w/ extra salt or something.  Surely, there must be something all these Yelpers are raving about, but I just don't see it right now.  \n\nI really, really wanted to like this burger, but it just didn't happen.", "author": "Grace K."}

If you're a little girl like me, the big burgers might be a bit much (I can only eat half and the other half is wasted because I don't like leftover burgers).  I order the mini burgers which is still bigger than an In N Out burger.  The sweet potato fries here are crinkle cut sprinkled with Garlic Salt.

If you don't believe me, see the proof for yourself underneath the menu.  I believe it.  It had to be one of the cleanest, most sterile burger joints I've ever been to!\n\nI was SO wanting to like this burger after reading all the reviews.  With a few other friends in tow, we ordered the Prized Pearl, the Spicy Sly and the Phat Bobb.\n\nSo here's the critique.  Though we ordered the burgers cooked medium, they were cooked a little too long to medium well, which created a pretty dry burger.  We liked the taste of the beef, but it was a pretty dense patty with little flavoring.  A little bit of salt, pepper & perhaps chopped onions would have gone a long way.  We liked the sesame bun, but it was also a little dry.  I prefer a Kaiser roll or a Challah roll myself.  However, we had to agree it was a good size and the condiments were excellent.\n\nThe Spicy Sly with sauteed onions, peppers, spicy sauce, jack & mayo was just spicy enough without being overpoweringly so.  It definitely had a kick, but it didn't kill your tastebuds so you couldn't enjoy the other elements of the burger.\n\nThe Phat Bobb with bacon, onion rings, bbq sauce, jack & mayo was tasty too.  The bacon was nicely crisped, the onion ring kept it's shape well and gave a satisfying crunch when bit into, and we liked that the bbq was more savory than sweet (i.e. more Cattlemen's than KC Masterpiece).\n\nThe Prized Pearl with bacon, sauteed onions, crumbled bleu cheese & mayo was good too.  Bacon makes everything better, right?  The only complaint about this one was that the bleu cheese wasn't salty enough.  I've found pre-crumbled bleu cheese tends to be less flavorful, so the ones that pack more of a pungent whallop (what this burger really needed) are the ones sold in wedges.\n\nAll in all, a decent burger but not quite the one I envisioned it to be.", "author": "Janet L."}

The place is very small so we got our order to go which took about 15 minutes to get.  We quickly walked up nob hill, hurrying home to taste the meal while still hot and fresh.  When we arrived at the apartment, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the folks at Pearls had strategically cut a hole in the top of my onion ring to go container to keep them from going soggy on the walk home - awesome!  The rings were composed of delicately sweet, soft yet slightly crunchy onions, and PERFECT, delicate, peppery, crisp batter.  My burger was The Ranch Burger with Buffalo meat - ranch dressing, cheese, avocado, tomato, a perfectly cooked medium 1/4 pound bison patty, on a not-too-hard-not-too-soft poppy seed bun.

On a Saturday night, we drove around forever trying to find street parking somewhere remotely walkable from Pearl's, but FAILED. Had to pay for parking.\n\n\"Well then, Pearl's had better be pretty freakin' amazing,\" we said to each other. Turned out to be a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint. They had special burgers, normal burgers, frings (fries, onion rings), springs (sweet potato fries, onion rings), spries, I think (fries, sweet potato fries), as well as various flavored milkshakes...including pumpkin and blueberry.\n\nI settled on the Teriyaki Burger (mushroom, jack cheese, patty, teriyaki sauce) and Y got a Phat Bob, another special burger.

Maybe you're thinking of wooly mammoths?\n\nWe ordered springs, but they heard wrong and gave us frings. I nicely asked to exchange them for springs and they nicely obliged. Total came to around $20.

Y described buffalo meat as tasting somewhere between beef and liver, which kinda disgusted me because I don't like liver.\n\nI probably ordered the wrong thing.

And what is better than having a place right across the street that serves them 6 times a week.  It's all been said before, so instead of giving the blah blah blah review about how it's great that they serve Buffalo, organic, and kobe meat in their burgers and how it doesn't matter what you ask for the outside of your burger always looks like it's been singed, I'll just tell you about the do's and don'ts of Pearl's.\n\nDO:\n-Always ask for medium rare. It doesn't really actually matter was you ask for (see above) but this will guarantee that you burger isn't too overdone.\n-Always ask for your fries well done or crispy. Since I usually get take away and Pearl's has a tendency to wait until you get there until they start making your fries (because who wants soggy fries,) sometimes they under cook them. Asking for well done or crispy fries will make sure that your fries are as good as they can be when entering your mouth.\n-Always get malt in your Milkshakes... even though that could just be a general overall rule when it comes shakes.\n-Always Tip! they do enough to keep that place friendly and clean that they really do deserve that extra buck.\n-Never get the Peanut Butter Shake unless you like eating peanut butter directly from the jar.\n-Always sit near the window if you can. Best seats in the place.\n\nNow food wise this place would only get 3 or 3.5 stars.

Pearl's doesn't live up to the accolades, awards, and praises.\n\nUnlike graphic tees, Paris Hilton television shows, and green house gasses; the world DOES need another good hamburger joint.  Hearing so much good things about this place made me giddy.\n\nPearl's is quite small.  Seating serves about 15 but 10 is likely more comfortable.  Half of the space is taken up by the kitchen.  Although their signage is nice the interior is quite humble and stripped down.  Their bathroom is surprisingly clean with only one graffiti tag.\n\nI ordered a \"Prize Pearl\" hamburger and a side of fries.  End total was about $10.  I was lucky enough to grab a table in this busy nest.  If you spot an empty table -- grab it.  The people in line won't realize until it's too late.\n\nTypical ketchup and mustard squeezers and napkin boxes are stationed at each of the tables.  They also have additional vinegar, halved pickles, and water in the front.\n\nMy hamburger and fries were individually served in red plastic trays layered with deli paper.  The burger was absolutely dripping with juice and grease.  The juice I like, the grease not so much.  This is a burger after all so I wasn't kidding myself.  \"Prize Pearl\" comes with mushrooms, grilled onions, sprinkled blue cheese, bacon, and beef patty in between two sesame seed buns.  The guy didn't ask me how I wanted my meat so I assumed that this was one of those places that didn't do it; I then heard others ask for custom meat preparation (~doh!).\n\nThe burger was okay.  If this came out of some roadside diner I wouldn't be so surprised.  I guess my expectations were too high.  Although the Prize Pearl sounded good in text, it didn't meld well in execution.\n\nJust way too many ingredients used in the wrong way.  It needed more cheese, the bacon needed to be sliced into bite sized pieces, the mushrooms and onions were all over the place.  The bread was also a problem for me.  At first glance I was glad they used higher quality bread, but this feeling didn't last long.  The bread doesn't elevate the burger to the next level like it should.\n\nFries are a let down.  They taste like the freezer bag kind.  They were so thick and feel stale I needed to use a lot of ketchup.  On the bright side, they give enough to feed two people.\n\nAs I ate I read the menu on the wall.  I wished I had ordered something different.  They even have buffalo meat for $1.50 more.  Still, the food I had tells me I wouldn't be satisfied with anything.\n\n___\n\nAn average burger joint constantly filled with fans.

Then when they were mentioned in the Eater SF poll about best classic burger (which I believe they won) I knew I really had to schedule some time to go.  Even though they're opening just a couple of blocks from work, I couldn't wait.  So hubby and I (I knew I would not be able to tackle these burgers myself) went for lunch.  I was kinda expecting it to be one of those dives, like Reds Java House, but instead I found a clean welcoming little burger joint.  I intended so show some restraint but my resolve was quickly weakened after reading the menu.  We ended up getting a burger each, springs and a milkshake.  Reading that now I'm not sure what we were thinking.  It was a lot of food.  The prized pearl burger was super tasty, juicy, etc, etc.  Everything you would expect from a classic burger.  I think next time I need to get the mini burger (1/4 lb) instead.  Or give up on the springs.  Okay, there's no way I'm giving up the springs.  The sweet potato fries were really good.  As was the milkshake, though I could probably sacrifice the milkshake if I had to.  I do not recommend ordering as much as we did if you want to avoid falling into a food stupor in the afternoon.  Was it worth it?  Yes.", "author": "Jean K."}

Hubby loved his burger too, though it was hella messy.\n\nOur only gripe is about our orders of fries and onion rings.  Our own fault for not noticing that they had a fries/onion rings combo.  That's fine.  But what we didn't like is that they had small and large orders of both - and without asking, we were charged for large orders.  Again, yes, we didn't notice there were two sizes - but you don't assume and charge for the more expensive one.  I can understand not mentioning the combo, but really, they should have asked if we wanted small or large orders of our sides.\n\nOn the whole, the burgers were good.

But I'm getting carried away, also something I do, so let's refocus. \n\nAnyway as it turns out the guy was from Hawai'i too. Now, you'd think a shared background in colonialism, miscegenation, and land rape would foster a stronger sense of brotherhood, but to my astonishment the dude was something of a prick because smack in the middle of our conversation he let the following non sequitur rip:\n\nDude: well, I'm not gonna sleep with you.\n\nFollowed by:\n\nMe: excuse me?\nDude: you have a nice body, but if you've got an ugly mug it ain't gonna work.\n\n...\n\nOHHHHH.\n                     HEEELLLLZ.\n                                                NO.\n                                                          HE.\n                                                                  DIDN'T.\n                                                                                  JUST.\n                                                                                               GO.\n                                                                                                        THERE.\n\nSeriously? SERIOUSLY?!? Did this guy have a motherfucking death wish? WHAT THE FUCK?!? I mean, I can't even fucking REMEMBER the last time someone said straight up to MY FACE that I was UGLY! And for the record I didn't even WANT to sleep with this asshole, okay that's a total lie but whatever this is my review and if you spurn me in person I'll deny any exchange of conversation or bodily fluids, not to mention that everyone knows dealing the \"Ugly\" card to someone gives them the right to play the \"Bitch\" one.\n\nBUT here's the thing. I'm learning. I'm maturing. See, instead of torching his car with Bacardi 151 and my purple lighter or stomping on his head with my stacked heel boots or attacking him with a rubber hose or otherwise acting out and directing my anger towards others like a sullen child I have taken ALL the vituperation crashing over my head like cresting waves in a warm ocean of hatred and internalized it LIKE A PROPER ADULT. And until that glorious moment when I rise from the ashes like the Phoenix and the pent up frustration and self-hatred explodes in a display of mature, adult irrationality like buying red Corvettes or accessorizing needlessly or paying for hookers or droping $50K for plastic surgery, I will settle for the quiet comforts of overeating -- in this case, Pearl's delectable burgers and shakes which were my balm and salvation after leaving the bar in a huff.\n\nWhether it's the Phat Bobb and its smoky, thick-cut bacon atop two onion rings and a meaty patty wrapped in jack and slathered with barbecue sauce and mayo, or the King, who is a cheesy despot of ground beef to which you will gladly submit since he's crowned with a hot dog (yes, a burger with a fucking HOT DOG ON TOP OF IT), Pearl and her friendly, professional crew KNOW THEIR MEAT. Toss in one of their lactatious (yes, I made that word up, fuck off, this is my review) shakes and crisp sweet potato fries and BOOM! you don't need ass for the evening.\n\nI give Pearl props for providing patties for the vegetarians and other health-conscious folks in the form of veggie burgers and buffalo burgers, thought to be honest I've never tried either 'cause if I'm gonna eat a burger I WANT A BURGER THAT WILL CLOG ALL MY ARTERIES ON SIGHT, the very idea of a patty low in fat is anathema to me (et tu McLean?!?).\n\nAnd listen up bitches, here's the deal-closer: it's open until 2 AM on Fri/Sat which, combined with its proximity to many downtown/TL watering holes, makes Pearl's a great leveler of social distinctions. 'Cause it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman; it doesn't matter if you're gay or straight; it doesn't matter if you're stumbling up to Post Street from a douchey venue (Redwood Room, Ambassador), a scenester venue (Rye, Bourbon&Branch), or a divey venue (Whiskey Thieves), the fact is you're STUMBLING and I think -- regardless of our differences -- we can all agree that the best way to prevent a hangover and cap off another luckless, sexless night is to eat a delicious burger.

We FINALLY got to the place around 6pm after being out since 11am. We were not disappointed. Sure you have to pay almost $8 per burger and sides and drinks are not included, but it is worth it. (Plus they offer combo meals, but I prefer to order a personalized burger.) \nI had the Phat Bob. I generally tend to think that most burger are average, but this burger was amazing! it comes with heaping portions of BBQ sauce, bacon, mayo, jack cheese and ONION RINGS! The rings were perfectly crisp even after the 15 minute ride home. My friend ordered the King Burger, (1/4 lb patty with a hot dog thousand island, and American cheese, surprisingly good.) We also ordered a side of the Spries. A perfect side of sweet potato fried and french fries, but we could barely eat them because we were so full! A great snack for a Sunday afternoon. \nYou can order to go and I would definitely recommend this place. they pack your burger in a sturdy carrying case for to-go orders and the staff is very friendly. Two thumbs up!", "author": "Antoinette C."}

Bison is the only red meat that is non-allergenic.\n    \n3.   Bison was the main diet of the Plains Indians who:\n\n      a. never had cancer\n      b. never had heart disease or heart attacks\n      c. lived to be 85 or 90 years old AND, scientists speculate, would  \n          have  lived to be 125 with adequate dental care.\n    \n4.   Eating 5oz of bison, 3-4 times per week can help most people reduce LDL cholesterol 40 to 45% over a 6-month period.\n    \n5.   Bison has 40% more protein than beef so you can eat 1/3 less volume and still come away satisfied.\n\nhttp://www.americangourmet.net/healthy-buffalo.html", "author": "LaSha G."}

This place is always busy, but mostly people get their burgers to-go. \n\nI wonder what characters I will encounter on my next trip to Pearl's...", "author": "Fancypants X."}

The fries, there regular fries aren't good not crispy enough and undercooked it seems, the sweet potato fried were great and the Onion Rings are AWESOME!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-21", "description": "Oh, a soft wind blows across the road as I head into Pearl's at the ungodly early hour of 4pm with two friends. One of our party was seriously jonesing for a Chocolate shake from Pearl's (they give you the bubble tea diameter straws) and the other two of us, had eaten 3 hours before but were pulled in by the mythical status of Pearl's burgers (which, incidentally, aren't so mythical on Sunday when they are closed).\n\nSo we arrived and there was a couple other people in the joint. They had their 100 health inspection front and center (and no bugs clearly visible) so we saddled on over to to the counter and proceeded to stuff our faces in the most gluttonous of Augustus Gloop manners. My \"impaired\" friend nearly fell into the 6 inch diameter straw of his tasty chocolate milk shake. His onion rings were notable, while the fries where just aight.\n\nBut you don't care about that, you wanna know about the burger.\nOverall, 7.5/10 on THE burger list ranking.\nBurger: Cooked medium rare Meyer beef. Nice size, but a little more greasy than I prefer.\nBun: White Bun, but had nice firmness and held up against a big burger.\nToppings: I ordered Cheddar and Grilled Onions. Which were both fine, although the cheddar didn't have the bite that I was looking for. Still, good. The burger also came with mayo, lettuce, and tomato ALREADY on it. I didn't know this, and generally would prefer to have none of those things on my burger. They put it on the bottom of the burger, so you don't know about it, until you pick the meaty goodness up.  \nSides: The onion rings were good, very mealy. The fries were alright, but it must be noted that they were the only things that remained uneaten on the table when we finished.\n\nFinal Analysis: This is the best \"Diner\" burger that I have had in town. I would watch out to make sure they don't put any toppings on that you specifically don't want, but they do a good job.  And, at $6.50, it is a very reasonable burger, especially compared to what you get at Burgermeister and Polkers.", "author": "Matt C."}

So, anyways, I try to pick up this beast and it was all like... dripping some juicy stuff. I mean, like... that has NEVER happened before when I normally order a standard burger. So, when I like... grab it... it was like... bigger than my whole mouth, I mean, how was I going to fit this inside of me. It's like WAY to big, WAY to much more that I was expecting to take. Huge. So, I try... all the while I am all like... embarrassed someone is like... watching me like... maybe a perv or something... trying to swallow this big hot piece of meat. I'm all like... scared of being raped at this point. Which totally freaked me out! I'm all like... looking around with my eyeballs to see if ANYONE is paying attention to just me. Freaks! So, by this point, I get like... a portion in my mouth... and it is like... dripping out the corners of my mouth... both sides... like... warm liquidy swiss cheese... so embarrassed... AGAIN! Thinking SOMEONE has to be staring at me. Like... you know, wanting to rape me! I mean, you know, when you go out to eat a burger you shouldn't think of rape. Anyways, so I have this big hunk of meat in my mouth... and get this, you will not effin believe what happens next... SO, it tastes like... you know... like... what heaven probably should taste like... if, you know, you believe in that sort of thing. Like... yeah... I know! Effin good... effin fuckin' heaven good. Like... all Pearly and stuff...\"\n\nSO, just so you know, like... I yelp a lot. No... like... an awfully lot. Seriously. So, you should probably listen to like... what I am telling all of you.

I ordered the mushroom burger with a side of fries.  \n\nThe food was definitely tasty, and the bun looked fresh and perky, which is a very good sign.

There are a number of fixin's and styles offered for you to munch on. The cost is pretty fair considering SF price gouging. These guys appreciate their patrons, there are gift certs to Sports Basement on site (where the manager works part-time) and they'll always try to give you what you want, so you come back again. They offer a good amount of tasty sides, from fries & rings together in perfect harmony to sweet potatoe strings. Its all good in the neighborhood at Pearls.\n\nCons: Size of the patties.\n\nMy one knock, and this goes for a lot of places, is that their patties tend to be kinda thin. I don't mind it some much at most places, this includes Pearls, however its my opinion that the really great burger joints handmake their patties thicker. That thickness lends to you having a tastier, juicier burger, not to mention often times those places will combine different cuts of meat in their patties. I can hardly hold that against Pearls though, as their patties are still of decent size and quality.", "author": "Charles L."}

That cost me $20 bucks. Once the food came I dug right in. The mini burger was exactly that a very tiny burger that I could have ordered from burger king $1 menu. The springs were not worth the $4 dollars I paid. The sweet potato fries were excellent but the few onion rings that came with it were all smashed, pretty much onion strings. The phat bob burger was good until I got to the center where I started to notice some pink in the burger. It's not like it was raw it just wasn't cooked all the way through, probably because of the size of the patty. \nThe place is very small and a lil grimy because of the amount or tables that are shared throughout the day. As soon as some one cleared their table others were already sitting down. No employee was even wiping the tables down. Oh and the one trash can in the place was overflowing with trash. \nOverall the spot was good (3 stars) but I'm definitely in no rush to go back but I would eat there again.

I know.\n\nThe meat was overcooked, not red at all, and lacks flavor. It was also kind of hard. Bacon was of the crumpled kind. Onion rings played no part in the taste. I just had a burger from Mel's last night that was better than this. I ate maybe 3/5s of it and stopped. \n\nGarlic fries were of the thick kind.

I didn't see any drippings from the burger. The Bomb is what you would expect of a burger with chili, cheddar, and onions. Nothing to wow about there. The Prized Pearl I had high expectations for since I love bacon and I love bleu cheese. Sorry to say, but the burger is not prized at all. The bacon was so fatty and tasted a little undercooked. I couldn't even even taste any bleu cheese. The only thing I can say for the frings .... Skimp! After about four reaches into the basket and it's all gone.\n\nMaybe I'll need to come back and try a buffalo or kobe beef burger.", "author": "Eric L."}

The selection of toppings is as complete as any gourmet burger joint (want avocado or mushroom? You got it). They've even got sweet-potato fries (with enough garlic to kill a vampire) and, of course, milk shakes.

Well played, Mr. Chappelle. Yet clearly, you have not had the burger at Pearl's? For the burger at Pearl's is juicy, pink, delicious, and yes, TENDER. So you see sir, the Tenderloin is about more than just \"smoking crack in front of Starbucks,\" the Tenderloin is about...well, it's about...(cough)...I dunno but we had a really good burger there.\n\nThe burger at Pearl's has been heralded by Tyler Florence and other fancy-panted celebrity chefs as one of the premier burgers in San Francisco. Pearl's is not a fancy restaurant (and I'd be hesitant to recommend an aspiring restaurateur to establish a ritzy place in the 'Loin) but you could easily find their burger in any upscale establishment. The 1/2 lb burger had a fancy weight, size and look and was quite good. We were somewhat disappointed to find out that Pearl's was not serving any of their top-notch meat - Niman Ranch, Kobe, or Buffalo - that we had seen highlighted in a publicity reel, but the FavCo Ranch substitute proved to be a worthy opponent. Our burgers were cooked perfectly-reddish pink throughout with a thin layer of brown encompassing the patty, which for some reason kept reminding me of an inside-out red M&M. The texture and consistency of the patty were great, although I thought the burger could have used a bit of seasoning to bring out more of that beefy flavor. The accouterments seemed fresh and the bun was proportional and springy. Note: Pearl's does not have a liquor license. Like bacon-chocolate, this sounds like a bad thing, but is not! Unable to purchase a beer at Pearl's, we purchased the 22 oz. beverage of our choice at a nearby corner store (Charlie would say \"bodega\" because he's east coasty like that)  and brown-bagged it into Pearl's. We came to find out that Pearl's wasn't BYOB either - uh oh - but the nice lady behind the counter (strongly) suggested that we pour our beers (quickly and discreetly) into large paper soda cups she provided. Win-win! Right?\n\n\nSize: 1/2 pound (their mini burgers are 1/4 pound)\nRanch: New Zealand's FavCo Ranch...although because the internets couldn't find their website for me, my doubts as to whether this \"FavCo Ranch\" actually exists will remain very high.\nMeat: Cow\nAccouterments: Arrives pre-assembled with lettuce, tomato, mayo and enough red onions to render your breath absolutely repulsive. Added cheddar cheese.\n\nBeer with burger: Ballast Point Big Eye IPA (from corner store)\n\nBeer availability: None. This place is as dry as a nun's gusset! I'm Rick James, bitch!\n\nAmbiance: And so we break our streak of uppity yuppity/bougie places, with Pearl's. Pearl's is a small burger joint, with a handful of two-tops and a street-facing counter that seats maybe four. It is brightly lit inside (although not easily spotted from the street) and very clean. The staff is friendly, efficient and informative. For most folks, it's the kind of place where you wouldn't imagine spending more than half an hour of your time. In fact, many of the patrons took their burger to go, but we are not most patrons! We beat out three generations of customers in staying past our welcome!

I love that you can choose the type of meat you want.  I love that they have a 1/4 mini burger (now if only they offered a meat choice for the mini).   I love that you can mix your fries or mix fries and onion rings.  \n\nIt isn't the best hamburger I've ever had but it is close.   I sort of wish it wasn't so close to home - my burger consumption has definitely gone up in the past couple of months.", "author": "Julie P."}

On my more indulgent days, I've had the deluxe pearl's burger (also your typical burger, but bigger than the mini), the Bula Burger, and the Phat Bob.  I recommend all of those, but be careful, they get really messy.\n\nOther stuff I've tried:\n\n-Chocolate shake:  Decent\n-Fries:  Occasionally I get them a little soggy, other times they are perfect\n-Frings:  Fries and onion rings; I noticed they tend to skimp on the onion rings, so if that's what you're really going for, just order onion rings\n-Garlic fries:  Love it!!  Super garlic-y.  Like the kind that makes your stomach ache, in a good way (but maybe not so much if you're with a date).", "author": "Michelle N."}

It's kind of like a french roll with sesame seeds, but still shaped like a burger bun. It's never too hard  or difficult to bite through like some french bread can be, but strong enough that the structural integrity isn't compromised by the greasiness/sauciness of the burger. I really cannot say enough about these fabulous buns.\n\nThe breading on the onion rings isn't my favorite, it's almost like the breading you'd find on some fried chicken. Too floury or something.\n\nThey have both beef and buffalo burgers and good milkshakes in a ton of flavors. Everyone who works there is friendly and if you order for take-out they wait until you come to pick it up to cook your fries so that they're fresh and hot when you take them away. A nice touch. Also, an inspection score of \"100\" from the Dept. of Public Health. Bonus.\n\nMaybe my favorite hamburger place this side of Bill's on Clement.", "author": "Trav W."}

They've got soda and other drinks like Snapple, Rockstar, etc.  \n\nIt's a bit spendy, but the dangerous thing is, the burgers are worth every penny.

Painful flourescent lighting, Spartan little tables, hard impersonal linoleum. Side orders don't come with the order - that means no fries, no drinks with that burger. The two women who took orders and made the food were nice enough. They took orders with a smile and walked your food over to your table promptly enough. This place takes cash and plastic, and you can call in for takeout. I see enough locals walking in here, which is a good sign. \n\nOh, and great feature: the choice of having your burger in full size (1/2lb.) or mini (1/4lb.).\n\nIf we're talking just about taste, the burgers are good. But the burgers are badly built. More bread than meat. Also, when you bite down on one side, all the toppings come squirting and squishing out the other side, and you don't really get any in your mouth. Very irritating, especially when you're trying to finish. \n\nI don't know if I'd come back. If so, it would be to give the other burgers a try - they have as many creations as some ice cream stores have flavors. The Prized Pearl with the blue cheese and grilled onions tasted off, and I was biologically punished for it later.

I dived right in the spot, and it just happened to be in front of Pearl's Deluxe Burgers... I honestly didn't even know it existed, but judging by the line, and that I was greeted on the street by the owner, I decided to try it. I stood in line like everyone else, and studied the menu.  I was surprised to see that they had Buffalo Burgers. The only other place I had that was in Vegas, and it cost me an arm and a leg.  I decided on getting a Buffalo Bacon Swiss cheese burger, with some garlic fries, and a vanilla shake.  I was also surprised because it was so clean, everyone was always cleaning the tables, the floors, the counter tops, washing, etc... you would think that the smell of cleaning supplies would over power the smell of the restaurant, but it didn't. I found that my mouth was starting to water while waiting for my burger, all the smells, and watching the other customers eat their food was to much to handle.  I wanted my burger asap so I can see if it tasted as good as it smelt and looked. \n\nWell as the 5 stars indicated above shows, the burger was amazing.  The taste of the buffalo was not gamy as I had expected, but very neutral and tasty.  Then the bacon was amazingly crispy, and the garlic fries were not to overpowering with garlic.  Washing the food down with the shake was also another bonus, it wasn't to heavy at all, and I didn't have to suck on the straw so hard that I felt like I was going to pass out.  I couldn't believe that everything I had touched and ordered was made to perfection.  Usually, the fries are soggy, and the meat is over cooked, or the vegetables are not fresh, but everything on my plate including the shake was exceptional.  Then I couldn't help but notice that the cashier / owner was very communicative with the customers.  Joking around, laughing, and making adequate small talk.  I hate it when owners, waiters, or cashiers, tend to jaber on and on, while you are trying to savor the food you have in front of you.  Anyways, I walked out of the store thinking that it may have been because I was so hungry that the food was so good, so I came back again with my wife and friends hoping to have a negative feedback. I was wrong, everyone loved it, they had the same opinions I did about the restaurant, burgers, owner, shakes, etc.  \n\nA definite 5 stars for Pearl's and thank you for bringing the restaurant to Post street. I have gone back about 9 times now and have become a regular.  I definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone in the Bay Area, the drive will be worth it. \n\nSteven W", "author": "Steven W."}

It was my first Pearl's burger. I heard from somewhere once that \"You know it's good if you have to wipe your mouth after every bite\", and this thing is so messily delicious. It dripped all over me, but I didn't even care. You can have the sauce on the side as well but if you enjoy Sriracha or Tabasco like I do, you will want it as the cook does it. Besides, I am a firm believer in just trusting the cook/chef.\nFor a few weeks, we would go there and try something different once in a while, until I tried the Prized Pearl. I am drooling as I think about it. Like, right now..... *drool*\nTHEN I asked for some spicy sly sauce, and it was, I kid you not, the BEST burger I have had in my life, fast food, gourmet, homemade, NOTHING can compare to that thick, juicy beef patty with Blue cheese, and... here it comes... BACONNNNNN!!!!!!! I have had bacon burgers, and I think what sets this apart is the quality of the beef and the bun.\nIt's about $7-8 for a burger, you can change it up to buffalo or wagyu if you like, they also have a wide selection of chicken burgers but I like to live beefy. \nSides are so-so but I was never a big fan of fries anyway so I can't judge those. Onion rings are similar to the frozen ones we have at a pool place, which are fine, but there are better places to get those. Here, it's about the burger.\nIt is just so pure and honest, the place is sooo tiny but the people are great, they'll do your burger however you like it (med, med-rare).\nI am now sorely disappointed that Yelp rates Hubert Keller's Burger Bar lower, I'm a big fan of his, but sorry Hubert, Pearl's is TOO good.", "author": "Lydia R."}

I mean, it's in the tenderloin and at the time, I wasn't craving a burger and wanted to go to the thai place across the street. I think picking this place over thai was the best decision I've ever made in my life. I got The Bomb burger and omggggg. The chili was perfect. The meat was cooked just right. The Nutella shake..................\n\nThe Nutella shake deserves its own paragraph. As if Nutella isn't delicious on its own, they just had to make a milkshake. I can't speak for any of the other shakes because the Nutella shake is just too good to not get so I haven't tried the others. In my opinion, it tastes exactly like a chocolate hazel Pirouette and thinking about it, makes me salivate.\n\nMoving on. I used to HATE sweet potato fries and when my friends got some, I decided to give them a try. ANOTHER great decision I've made in my life. The fries were fried just right and not too salty. Just perfect! The day after my first time here, I seriously started to get withdrawals. I missed my burger so much and every burger I've had after that day just did NOT compare. In-n-out even started to taste bad and I LOVE(D) In-n-out. I went again last weekend and got the BBQ chicken burger and that thing was HUGE. I needed a stack of napkins because of the burger. It was delicious, but not as good as The Bomb. I want to come back and try the Kobe burger that everyone is talking about. I swear thinking about this place kills me. It's just too good! The service is great. The staff is really friendly!\n\nThe only thing that disappointed me was the time changes. One night, I tried going here with my boyfriend and a couple friends (we were super excited to eat Pearl's). We got there around 12am only to find out that they changed their weekend closing time from 2am to 11pm ): But that won't change my love for Pearl's!", "author": "Camille T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-15", "description": "So we called this night \"Babes and Burgers\" and it was a real deal, roll up the sleeves, mean and serious research night with the homegirl 'food-in-the-city committee'.  As per a stellar yelp review, neighborhood savory hearsay, and the agreement we'd go 'mom &pop' vs. 'gourmet'- Pearl's Deluxe Burgers was the mark for this reconnaissance mission on this warm San Francisco night. \n\nThe venue was straight to point. No frills, no pretentiousness . This is a business that boasts 'we sell damn good burgers here' nothing more nothing less. That was noted from the get-go and the joint was conducive for our no- mercy burger examination that was to follow. \n\nWe wanted to a good variety to sample. Four girls, 3 burgers to share in attack:  Pearl's Deluxe w/ Blue Cheese (for the classic), Phat Bob w/ Buffalo Meat (for the girth), and the Pesto Burger (for kicks). \nOf course we had to see what the Spries (sweet potato fries) was about, which we got laced with crunchy sweet onion rings. \n\nThe notes:  An obvious respect (if not worship) of the meat as the big boss in the bun; grilled perfectly medium/ medium rare. Whether it was the blue cheese, pesto, or bbq sauce in each of these burgers cases- the condiments were careful not to mask taste but accentuate; the bun buttery and light in a happy soft embrace of the beef. And every bit was bite-able and fat with taste. The attention to detail was exciting- props to the architecture of each.  There was surprisingly nothing but a harmony of yums and oohs that came from our table. \n\nQuotes: \n\"Despite the medley of flavors in a single burger, my taste buds and olfactory system were surprisingly not overwhelmed.\" \n\n\"I don't usually like blue cheese, but the combination of blue cheese, red onions lettuce and sauce made it fantastic!\"\n\n\"pesto burger a surprise and the buffalo meat very tasty with just enough spices.\"\n\nConclusion: Based on the varied elements of our sample tonigh, we agreed the burger to build next time would be a Pearl's Deluxe/ buffalo meat/blue cheese/ and bacon. No joke. That'll be the winner. That, and the spries (couldn't take one bite without the 'that's good' nod). And lastly, the staff. Justin (who reigns there Tues, Wed, Thurs) exemplified down home service, pride of his product and the intergenerational family history behind building a great neighborhood feel good burger...all of these, made the experience addictive and hearty for sure.", "author": "irie o."}

After several months of eating here with increasing frequency, it's only right that I bump my rating to five stars. This place serves the best burger that I've ever had. Yum.\n\nNow, in my last review, I mentioned the milkshakes. They are disappointing. Which is fine - otherwise, I'd be having far more milkshakes than I should. This raises the question, incidentally: how many milkshakes should one have? I don't have an answer to this vexing problem yet.\n\nSo the only real problem (and it's a PROBLEM) is that they aren't open on Sunday. This is highly disappointing. Not like the milkshake thing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-26", "description": "I found out about Pearl while traveling from the airport to downtown SF at 9:30 in the evening. Having just landed from a long flight, I was starving to death (I avoid food on planes at all costs), and I needed something quick and good. Naturally, I opened my Yelp app on my phone and searched for places near my hotel. \"Burgers\", 1300+ reviews and 4 stars were more than enough to convince me. I asked my cab driver to drop me off right by it.\nFrom outside, Pearl looks very unassuming. Had I not known about the Yelp reviews, I would have never went it. It is a true hole-in-the-wall. It is very small inside, and under normal circumstances, I would have questioned the hygiene as well, but who cares about hygiene at 9:45 PM, and you haven't had any proper food for 5-6 hours? I ordered the buffalo burger (medium) which was an additional 4 bucks on top of the regular burger. I took a seat at one of the small tables and started waiting patiently. My burger arrived in about 6-7 minutes. It was sized perfectly: not too small, but not too big either to the point that I couldn't handle it comfortably. The patty looked juicy, which surprised me because buffalo burgers tend to dry out pretty fast due to its low fat content (It is actually leaner than chicken). It was topped of with the standards: lettuce, tomato, onion. I opted for mustard instead of mayo. It was absolutely delicious. Probably the best burger I have had the entire 2012.\nI probably had the most basic burger on the menu. Their menu is full of burgers with fancy topics or you can create your own. I am pretty sure they all taste good. The guys at Pearl definitely have the basics right, which is the most crucial to building a good burger! I will definitely be back.", "author": "Mustafa K."}

It was moist and flavorful, and for $7.99, not too bad of a price for the size of the burger.  The only downside is that you have to order the fries/onion rings on the side.  On the plus side, you can get those sides mixed and matched, i.e. sweet potato fries w/onion rings = springs.  On my second visit, I got the bula burger in a mini size for approximately $6.00.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-29", "description": "To borrow a phrase from one of my fellow yelpers, NOM NOM NOM!!!! This burger joint served quite possibly the most delicious burger I've ever had. \n\nAfter yelping the area around me for a bite to eat while in San Francisco Pearl's came up and encouraged by the great reviews and the announcement that Pearl's was being feature on the Food Network (which I must say, is VERY well deserved), I made the quick walk over with my sister and a friend. We actually walked right past it at first but the smell of frying onions and sweet and spicy teriyaki sauce turned us right back around. We walked in and true to other reviews, the place is small. There isn't a lot of seating but there is a pretty good rotation of customers and people are considerate about getting up when they are finished with their meal so other patrons can sit. \nAfter staring at the menu board for a solid 5 minutes (so many delicious choices, how do I choose?!) I decided on the pesto burger and a coconut milkshake. My sister and I did a quick conference and decided to order different burgers (me, pesto, her, the bula) and cut them in half so we could each try each others. We also ordered sweet potato fries and onion rings. After a short wait, our food was brought to our table and Oh. My. God. My pesto burger was cooked to medium perfection and was covered with an amazing basil pesto sauce, jack, mayo and tomato. My taste buds screamed with longing every second I wasn't taking a bite. After (quickly) finishing my half of the pesto burger I moved on to the bula burger (cooked medium and smothered in bacon, Swiss, mayo and spicy pineapple teriyaki sauce)...and wtf?! How is this possibly better than the pesto?! I literally didn't talk for a solid 8-10 minutes while savoring each precious bite (but did realize why each table has a well-stocked napkin dispenser. Helpful tip of the day: pull some out napkins ahead of time so you don't waste seconds while eating). \n\nAnd now on to the sides...a lot of places I've been to have either great sides or great main dishes. Not this place. The onion rings were cooked to battered perfection and the sweet potato fries were a little crisp on the outside and soft in the middle without being to mushy. The coconut milkshake I had was probably the best milkshake I've ever had. I know coconut is usually a yes or no kind of thing for people but this was a perfect blend of sweet coconut without being too overwhelming. My friend (who doesn't like coconut) gave it a try and was instantly hooked (and then rejected over and over again throughout the meal when he kept asking for another sip. Sorry buddy, get your own!) \n\nI am not at all surprised that this establishment is being featured on the Food Network and I am eagerly anticipating my own return on my next visit to San Fran. If you are in the area, do not miss this spot!!!", "author": "Amy C."}

It's like any other hole in the wall.  It's small with about seating for 10 people and is opened pretty much throughout the day.  The service is pretty quick and they are super nice.  Average price is $7 a burger, but for the value, its pretty good.  However, even with the specialty burgers, nothing super excited me.  I had the following:\n\n-Prized Pearl w/ Mushrooms (+$1) - it was huge, and i mean huge.  Well worth the money, but the burger patty was sort of lacking flavor.  the grilled mushroom and onions were just over over saturated with oil and by the time i got the burger, the bottom bread peice was soaked in oil and I could start seeing through the paper.  The bule cheese was a neat new thing on a burger for me, but aside from being stuffed, I don't see myself making that trek back to this place for a burger.\n-Springs - sweet potato fries and onion rings were mediocre.  Onion rings fell apart and the onion wasn't fully cooked.  The sweet potato fries weren't fully cooked either as they were not fully soft in the middle.  I guess its best to get thinner cuts.  \n-Mint Oreo Shake - Probably my favorite item on the menu which was easily finished.  I split this with a friend and to our surprise, one order easily fills 2/3 of 2 cups.

I LOVE your burgers, LOVE your 49er's dog and your spicy sly whoooo on point... amazing. Here the thing I work down the street and eat here often and recently I'm starting to have a sad face when I order the chilly cheese fries :( first of all the price went up hmm... but that's not a big deal the problem there its been at least 5 times that I haven't had any cheese and the bear minimum of onions c'mon thats the best part. The chilly is also lacking its watered down like no meat and this is really bumming out because I always add spicy sly to my chilly so now it extra watered down makes me sad.\nOverall I still will give you guys a 5 star rating because it would not be fair to bad mouth MY FAVORITE hamburger joint in the city. If you haven't been here yet its one of sf gems the spicy sly burger, turkey burger, ohhh god i'm getting hungry again, I'm eating chilly cheese fries as I type, EAT HERE...\n\nBut pearls I'm telling you my co-workers and I are talking you got to shape up though to up the price on your chilly cheese fries and for them to get worst its not a good look. one day its on point and one day short c'mon stay consistent \n\nP.S\nI'm not bad mouthing perals get it straight I FUCKING LOVE PEARLS...

Of course, we started to talk about food just to make ourselves more hungry. Pearl's was an immediate suggestion by the canadians, claiming it to be better than Burgermeister. Now my interest was peaked. Then the rumbles became growls as more time passed while we unkowingly sailed past our dock, followed by hours of being lost in the bay. Pearl's became a shiny beacon, a reward for finding our dock, something to look forward to, something to satisfy the tired sailor. And it was! A simple cheeseburger was pure love.

The huge chalk board menu made up for the sparse decor- but what they lacked here, they made up for the burger menu offering!  I thought to myself- its other namesake could have been, \"HOUSE OF THE $6.95 BURGERS!\"  All the burgers were priced at 6.95- that's one yelp STAR!  Moving right along the menu- they had FRINGS- people- I rest my case- half onion rings and half fries- this saves me extra bucks because this is the best of both worlds on one plate - hmmm maybe that was too far-fetched- but I just love these sides and end up ordering each one with my burgers at other restaurants! That's an additional Burger Star- ooooh I mean YELP star!  (Can you tell I'm getting excited about this place???) Sooo moving right along- the next order was for milkshakes- my friend had the Oreo milkshake- but I opted for my all time favorite strawberry flavor- if theirs had chunky pieces of strawberries in there- why-- I think I might just give them two stars!!! Once the milkshake tasting was at hand- I decided to give it my u;timate test:- THE 'let the straw stand for 20 secs test'...Wait and see if the straw starts to lean towards the side...if it doesn't, my friend you have just found the best milkshake in town!  I stopped counting after 25 seconds- cuz I just had to have a strawful right there and then!  I had to gather so much suction cuz those strawberry pieces were HUGE!!!  WOW- I think I just  found my favorite place- creamy and thick just like Blue Bell ice cream back in Texas!\nEverything else was great- burgers were hot,  moist and juicy- fries were crisp , onion rings were fresh and crunchy but most of all- the service was prompt and courteous.\n\nPS- I'm having the Oreo milkshake next time- and you can just roll down the hill when you exit.\n\nUPDATE: 4/30\n\nThey are now the BEST $7.95 Burgers in town!", "author": "Arissa C."}

Or something like that which won't get me struck down from a bolt from above if there really DOES happen to be a higher power.\nI am in a pot induced food stupor from the Prized Pearl with an upgraded buffalo patty (applewood smoked bacon, blue cheese, sauteed onions), Springs (sweet potato fry and onion ring combo) and peanut butter chocolate shake.  My wallet is also $17.50 lighter but this is going to be the only meal I eat today so I'm good with that.  This was a HUGE meal as the burger was a 1/2lber to say nothing of the king size shake and the large portion of sweet potato fries and onion rings.  However, I danced and hooked up with *that guy* all night long and we decided to forego the early morning grub for the dessert of each other and so at 2:30pm I was RAVENOUS.  So it's good for that kind of situation for sure.\nI can't say enough about how good these burgers are and my only complaint is that I neglected to ask for my burger rare and they automatically prepare all burgers medium.

When I first saw the place, the decor really put me off- the walls are a horrible lavender color, and the place just isn't aesthetically pleasing. I do tend to judge a book by it's cover, and I was wrong. Bad interior design aside- you can get one of many creative burgers (one has a spicy pumpkin chutney sauce), and for $1.25 more get organic beef (that's what I do- it makes an already excellent burger perfect), or for $1.50 more you can get your burger made out of buffalo. They have great onion rings, fries, garlic fries, and sweet potato fries that are cooked in rice bran oil (which doesn't raise cholestorol...they say it lowers it....that's my excuse for eating the fries....). They have shakes and malts, with your usual flavors, or you can get black cherry and orange cream or oreo shakes. It's really easy to drop $ here (my order is usually a chocolate malt, garlic fries, and a pearls burger with cheddar and organic beef, and it's around $17). But this food is well worth it. It is just as addictive, more expensive, more fattening than crack, but when you leave you leave sane...so I'd say I choose Pearls as my drug of choice.", "author": "Nick M."}

I'd never been there before, even though I used to live a block away from it, and now live 3 blocks away from it, because on first glance, (well, also on second and third glance) it appears to be just a hole-in-the-wall, mediocre, doesn't-even-have-a-beer-and-wine-license kinda place. \nThe first thing you see when you look through the door is a Coca-Cola soda fountain - not exactly the feng shui equivalent of a fish tank. The interior is painted almost entirely in a pale lilac color. What happened to good old orange? Psychology has proven that it makes you hungry. Or even a red, though they would have to refurbish the dark-blue plastic-cushioned chairs. There also is not alot of seating, although it's more than my all-time favorite San Francisco burger place, Sam's (618 Broadway). But Sam's has character that Pearl's desperately lacks. Of course, if Pearl's looked like Sam's, no one in Lower Nob Hill would ever eat there. But I love Sam's. \nI'm getting off track. After entering Pearl's and being somewhat disgusted at the lack of interior taste, I took a look at the menu. The first thing I noticed was buffalo burgers. That's right! We eat buffalo here in California! It's both healthier AND manlier than beef! Full of omega-3 fatty acids! They also offer all-natural beef, hormone free, organically-grown, non-gmo. And they deep-fry their deep-fried stuff in rice bran oil, which has a mild flavor, 400-something degree smoke-point, and no trans fatty acids. And some other good stuff. And the best part yet: I asked if they had pickles, and the guy behind the counter (the owner, I later found out) pointed to a BIN of kosher dill pickles over with the condiments! I could take as many as I wanted! I had four. \nAlso of note, when we got our food, the lettuce was perfectly green (not iceberg) neatly folded to fit within the boundaries of the bun, and the tomato was ripe and red. The 1/4 pound buffalo patty was cooked a proper medium-well, which I was a little disappointed with, as I'm used to the SF-fine-restaurant medium-well, which is really like medium-rare. But they get points for doing it right; next time I'll ask for medium-rare. The only thing that would have improved the meal itself would have been a big cold pint of beer. Or even a bottle of Corona, Sam's-style. So I asked the man whom I now understood to be the owner about the disappointing lack of beer, and he informed me that the \"Neighborhood\" would cause him some problems if he tried to serve alcohol... despite, or maybe because of, the overpriced liquor store right next door. He also told me that the \"Neighborhood\" got rid of the trashcan on that block because they were sick of having trash there. I myself have purposefully littered on that block after noticing the frustrating lack of trashcan. I will continue to do so.\nSo despite the lack of any kind of atmosphere or alcohol, Pearl's Deluxe Burgers gets four stars.

The place is about the size of a shoe box. Service was fast and friendly. The shake was so good my girlfriend ordered another. If you're willing to give them a try look close as we missed the place because of it being sandwiched between and Indonesian and Thai place. I'm not sure I would go back as there are many other places in the area to get a good burger. To be honest we would have been better off at an in and out burger. What we ordered came to nearly $31 not counting the second shake. For that price we could have gotten more and better quality elsewhere and even been able to sit down and eat.", "author": "Brian J."}

What makes these burgers so great? After all, it's just beef n bun n basic condiments right? Well at Pearls they start with high quality beef, and you can even opt for Kobe beef! The patties are hand done NOT in a press and frozen for future use. Loosely packed patties mean the juices can flow freely thru the burger during the cooking process and get trapped inside for an altogether juicier experience.  Then there's the bun.  These seem to me to be baked fresh onsite daily... No day old or week old buns like most places I've tried in the city. Soft, yeasty homemade taste.... Amazing! And of course the condiments and toppings .... Well most places can't screw this part up, but as for pearls, I can say the cheese is very high quality and fully immersed onto the patty once u get it, and if you order the mushroom burger, it will be completely smothered with them! Unlike other burger joints that make you search and find them to be sure the cook got your order right. Anyway, this is worth the trip from anywhere in the city, so just try it!

I think the last time I had a burger was at a Giants game....last season =). So when my friend told me about this place, I figured it was about that time of the year that I met my quota for a burger and fries. She raved about this place telling me how big and juicy the burgers were. She wasn't kidding. I ordered the Pearl's deluxe w/bacon, no cheese (I know, but I'm lactose) and a small order of onion rings. My friend ordered the same w/cheese and an order of sweet potato fries. Yes, I know, we should've ordered the Springs (onion rings and sweet potato fries combo), but we didn't think about it. Nevertheless, we shared. My burger was huge, at least it was huge in my book and had the fixin's (lettuce, tomato, onions, and mayo). I think there were 3 or 4 strips of bacon in mine. The patty was a 1/2 pounder and it was thick and juicy. However, my friend told me that it's usually juicier and seemed liked they cooked our burgers well-done instead of medium. Didn't matter to me, because I'd rather have it well-done, yet this burger was juicy like it was cooked medium. I used several napkins to wipe off the juices on my fingers and hands. Didn't need to put any ketchup on my burger. It was good the way it was. The onion rings were delish along with the sweet potato fries. I finished my burger.  If I ate burgers on a regular basis, I don't think I would've been able to finish it, but I don't, so I devoured mine =).

I also liked the option to get half sweet potato fries and half regular, though I might just get the sweet potato in the future.  Having the option of a mini burger was awesome and it was under $5, which is amazing. I first thought it would be too small after seeing it on some other people's plates, but it was perfect and I was more than full.  The burger was cooked fairly rare, but juicy and delicious.

We were clueless of what to order so just ordered the 1/4 burgers which are called \"mini's\" and they were super moist and juicy they are similar to San Diego icon Rocky's Crown Pub in PB.  The buns were amazing and my wife was raving for days about the sweet potato fries.  On top of the food the guy behind the counter (not sure if he is an owner but his attitude was definitely owner worthy!)  was awesome he told us that he would put some tables together and make sure we  all sat together.  He checked on us despite being busy and the place was basically all locals.  Highly recommend if you are in or around Union Square.

Since you're already engulfed in gluttony, top it off with a free pickle, it's worth it!

The buns are awesome - sesame seeds add that extra oomph that I expect when paying $8 for a burger (which is a pretty normal price nowadays unless you are at a fast food place....and if you are in this city, you are crazy. there's so much better out there.). Anyway, we also had the garlic fries which were good as well, probably don't need to get them with the garlic next time (there were probably 6-7 fresh cloves diced on top of the fries). We both decided to get shakes to go because that's how we roll - I went with the nutella (amazing!) and he got the peanut butter (also good). Shakes are $3.50 for normal flavors and $4.00 for specialty flavors. Everyone working there was really nice.

Either you haven't been to San Fran before (parking issue) or you haven't been to McD's or Burger King lately (price). Parking is an issue everywhere here but after circling about 8 times, found a spot 1/2 block away. And that time was well spent in the long run. Price was DEF NOT an issue as it probably cost just a few dollars more than the slop you'd get in McD's or BK! And as for the size of the place..who cares?

I came here for a late dinner around 11 on a Saturday night.  It was hard to find parking though, I must warn you; I went around a couple of times in the surrounding area before my friend spotted some parking.  I looked inside and found that much of the place was packed(hard to compare capacity for a hole-in-the wall location.  It was a good sign though because the atmosphere seemed like it was a great hangout spot.  I waited very shortly in line before it was my turn to order and when I did I got the Pearl's Deluxe Burger with Bacon, Frings and a medium soda which came out to $13.  It didn't take too long before my food was ready and the cashier came over to clean our table and wiped down the condiment bottles before that.   I appreciated the customer service that was shown. When my food came, man was I happy.  The first bite of the burger, I felt like I was in heaven; it was so tender, the juice started dripping into the tray.  Although my friend was not eating, I was so impressed with the quality of the burger that I got him a knife and fork and said, \"You've got to try this!\"  After his first bite, he agreed.  The frings were under seasoned in my opinion but I'm guessing you could ask for salt and pepper among other things.  I also must add that the cashier was very generous with the supplies and requests I made such as the knife and fork and takeout box. In all, it was a very filling and delicious meal.  I ended up taking out the frings which I will season myself at home.", "author": "Brandon Y."}

Now, for the sake of full disclosure, I have to say that my craving may have affected my perception of the burger. But the Bula Burger with Kobe beef was de-lic-ious. The half-pound monster was everything I had dreamed about: juicy, thick and flavorful. The Boyfriend and I shared the burger with an order of \"frings\" (fries and onion rings). The fries were decent - thick, crispy on the outside, mealy on the inside (like the Whopperburger's, for those of you who get the literary allusion). The onion rings were tasty - real onion! They went well with the burger and some ranch sauce. I loved how the bacon in the burger was REAL bacon - thick and juicy. There were some fatty gristly parts I had to not eat but I'm a fan of Pearl's now. I can't wait to go back and try some more.

I ordered the Phat Burger and my son ordered the Bula Burger.   We also had springs, the sweet potatoes and onion rings combo, and a blue berry shake.   We got there at 2:00 and were able to get a table.  The food was ready in six or seven minutes.   My burger was about five inches high with all the fixings.   The burger must be eaten with two hands and over the basket so all the drippings and fat that flow from the burger are caught.   You also must have at least four napkins as this is a very juicy burger.  The bula burger includes ample bacon and a sweet slightly spicy teriyaki sauce.   Also a winner.   The meat weighs in at 1/2 pound so bring an appetite.   The blueberry shake was thick and filed with bits of blueberry -   The onion rings were much better than the sweet potatoe fries.

I was seriously jonesing for a burger.  I ordered a pesto burger & asked for  them to substitute turkey ($7.79), then had the chili cheese fries ($5.49).  Though I thought the pesto burger, which was a specialty burger, was slightly overpriced, it was big & tasty.  The chili cheese fries, though of a healthy serving, were nothing to get excited about.  They advertise their chili as being homemade; theirs is way too soupy for me.  They also skimped on the cheese, though they were kind enough to ask if I wanted the fried with onions or without.  Their selection of specialty burgers is extensive enough & buffalo burgers are on offer as well.  Their regular burgers were more reasonably priced.  I liked the turkey pesto burger well enough to assure my return, but the chili cheese fries are better at Sliders.  The place is really small with no atmosphere to speak of, so it's probably better to get your order to go.", "author": "Tina B."}

I'm not sure what I was expecting, maybe just tasty hamburger with either cheese or bacon, but I didn't think that there would be this many choices on  the menu. After a lot of himming and haaaing over which burger to order, I finally decided to go for the pesto burger. I chowed that down as fast as I could, without getting messy! That was a tasty burger. My boyfriend got the Bula burger with the pineapple, but they forgot the pineapple. He still thought the burger was still good, though. I wanted fries of course, but then the person taking my order throws out to me me onion rings, fries, sweet potatoes or a mix of two. Huh? That's awesome! Then I had to decide on which two I wanted. The sweet potato fries were delicious, fried just right. The onion rings could of had a little more seasoning on them though. Of course I had to have a milkshake to go the fries.... but there were also too many flavors. What to do? I wanted the coffee, but then I saw Oreo cookie and he said why not have both? OMG that milkshake combo.... there are no words for it. What I really liked about this joint is that they have organic beef and the option to have buffalo or even chicken. I think that Pearl's has a little bit of everything for everyone. The restaurant is teeny tiny, but clean. This location has only been opened for about 14 months.

I've always gotten the Pearl's Deluxe - bleu cheese, grilled onions, and bacon. It's juicy, greasy and flavorful, everything you look for in a good burger. Trust me when I say you'll need a stack of napkins before you start eating. I try to limit myself from eating here too often since this would be the total opposite of eating healthy unless you order their garden burger and that just wouldn't make any sense. They're generous with their portions so my wife usually orders the kids size burger(I'd like to see the kid that can finish that size a burger). They also have milkshakes. I usually order the nutella milkshake. For those of you that don't know, nutella is a chocolate hazelnut spread that you can put on toast or waffles or make great milkshakes out of. It's a small place so you'd be lucky to grab one of the dozen or so seats. Try to go at odd times. I've been there before 12pm and around 12am, both times were perfect. It's in the middle of the city so parking can be a challenge especially Friday or Saturday nights.

I've eaten here several times when the hubby wins that argument.  They get points for offering organic meat and yummy milkshakes.  However, one time when I ordered the turkey burger, I got food poisoning.  A mixed bag.", "author": "Shelley N."}

The first three times were awesome because I ordered the Pearl Deluxe and Garlic fries.  A couple of days ago, I tried the Pesto Burger with Buffalo meat and the sweet potato fries on the recommendation for a yelper.  Big mistake.  The Pesto burger was tasteless, and the sweet potatoe fries weren't anything special.  Stick with the Deluxe and the garlic fries.", "author": "Ian L."}

My girlfriend and I order to different burgers, one being \"The Phat Bob\" and the other \"The Bomb\".  The Phat Bob was pretty much bacon and a bun with a HUGE hint of BBQ sauce.  Mine being the The Bomb was a F*^*ing bomb!  Picture chili with two slices of bread.  The bread was so disgustingly sopping wet with Chili you honestly had to eat the thing with a spoon.  I know its open faced but come on, really. Oh and another thing burger meat shouldn't be like Beef Jerky, where's the moistness at???  LUCKILY the one thing they had going for them were the milkshakes, they were pretty decent.  I can honestly say I am never going back there again.", "author": "Steve C."}

I am on a constant quest for a good turkey burger/sweet potato fry combo.  This place will do for now.  Cute little environment... not a lot of seats, though, so be prepared to wait for a seat.", "author": "Toni A."}

You can get bison burgers or burgers made with organic, grass fed Estancia beef, but I like to just get their standard Niman Ranch burgers.  For those who can't decide whether they want fries or onion rings, they can order a combo called \"frings.\" Can't decide between onion rings and sweet potato fries (yes they have them!)?  Just get the \"springs.\" If you like milkshakes, you'll be in heaven when you see their menu; they have your standard flavors plus all kinds of more creative, or as my friend calls them \"fancy flavors\" (peach, cookies & cream, peanut butter).  The staff is super efficient and nice; basically they're the kind of people you would least mind being stuck in an elevator with.  The food is best eaten there at the restaurant; although there is limited seating, there is pretty good turnover, so I normally don't have to wait too long for a seat.  Pearl's is open 'till 2 a.m. Fridays & Saturdays, so it's a great place for late-night snacks.  They used to close on Sundays, which was very depressing, but now they are open all week.  I just went there yesterday, and I saw a hand-written sign thanking customers for their support and saying Pearl's was going to be featured on  Food Network's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate.\". They totally deserve it, as I have been a frequent customer for the past couple years & have found their food & service consistently good.", "author": "Anis S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-24", "description": "This place is greeaaatttttt!!!! I've been here four times and each time I've had something delicious. I've had the Phat Bobb which is sooo tastey. The barbecue sauce that dripped out of the burger was great for dipping my onion rings into! I also had the King Burger which was like a heart attack waiting to happen. One whole sausage combined with a burger?! Really really really good. I do recommend adding lettuce and tomatoes and such or else you're just eating meat and cheese, which is good too but i think having a burger requires to get the extras. The sides are also very good. The first time I went I had the onion rings which I considered the best onion rings I've ever had. Pricing is good too. Shouldn't spend more than $12 for a specialty burger and a side. The specialty burgers are all 1/2 lb except for the King burger, which is 1/4 lb, and if those are too big for you you can order a mini burger. They also have buffalo and turkey burgers for the people who have the will to be healthy in a place where it feels sooo good not to be.", "author": "Craig D."}
