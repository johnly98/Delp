I love being pampered. \n\nEarlier this week I came back and met up with a friend for breakfast here. He was here from Germany and he stayed at one of the infamous hotels lining Mid-Market and so I suggested Equator, recalling their terrific frittata sandwich. (I like the one with chorizo, which is nice'n'spicy.) \n\nGranted, the location is less optimal for some as it is smack in the middle of everything that many people dislike about San Francisco: drug addicts & homeless people. What I learned from the Equator folks though - and that is one of the reasons I came back - is that they recruit from within this community. I like coming to the Tenderloin, as it kind of makes me aware that not all is well in that a little bubble we call San Francisco...\n\nMy only pet peeve is this: I've been here three times now and every time I walked in, I didn't get greeted...and it wasn't even super busy, as the staff were chatting with each other. This non-acknowledged entrance is enhanced by the fact that it's not super clear at which part of the counter to place your order. So for the first few moments I'm always a bit lost.

When I passed by it on a Market Street streetcar, I thought it was a mirage since I wouldn't have expected a welcoming cafe like this next to the Warfield Theater. Good things, however, appear to be coming to the neighborhood in threes between this place, Chai Bar by David Rio across Market, and Montesacro Pinseria Romana Enoteca on Stevenson. Each brings a much-needed freshness to an embattled area where police sirens and primal screams reflect more of the norm. There's no denying the rejuvenation that the Mid-Market corridor is starting to experience thanks to the likes of Twitter and Uber nearby.\n\nThere is patio seating cordoned off carefully from the passing foot traffic although this hasn't stopped the occasional local denizen from gawking awkwardly at the customers. The seats are concrete blocks, so I assume the proprietors are not looking for people to loiter for very long (photo: http://bit.ly/1KSttlh). There actually isn't much seating inside, just some stools against the left window counter and a standing counter to the right. The walls are covered with images of jungle foliage painted by local artist Mona Caron (photo: http://bit.ly/1IAy8ee), who painted the fanciful Market Street Railway Mural on Church Street. There's a surprising diversity of food items for sale: five different kinds of arepas, three salads, even fried chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/1T8sBih).\n\nI was there just before a Yelp event at Montesacro and ordered the $4.75 16-oz Vanilla Latte (photo: http://bit.ly/1QHxrPw). It was smooth and not too sweet with an even richness that proved satisfying before my anticipated pinsa gorge. I like the idea behind the proposed \"suspended coffee program\" which encourages patrons to buy an extra coffee for someone less fortunate. That's the kind of practice that will help it build goodwill in an area that isn't used to showing it. By the way, there is indeed a restroom if you don't mind the labyrinth of making your way down to the basement of the Warfield building through the main lobby next door. Equator has really established a discernible foothold in this war zone, and I just hope they don't give up.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...Blue Bottle-like richness in their lattes should draw in the caffeinated hipsters\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...an oasis with tropical palms on the walls\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly nice enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...kudos for opening a cafe at the unenviable corner of 6th & Market", "author": "Ed U."}

Walking in you're first greeted at the door and handed a menu by a very friendly gentleman and then enter into a very hipster shop with no seating and a live dj playing music in the corner. Quite the way to start the day.\n\nIn addition to standard coffee bar options, they also have fruit squashes (handcrafted muddled fruit sodas), shakeratos (shakened sweetened flavored ice espressos), arepas, noshes, salads, yogurts and sandbox baked goods. Great selection and I especially enjoyed the classic shakerato. \n\nOn top of liking what they offered for food, drinks and atmosphere, I really appreciate the addition of a nice establishment like this to the mid-market area.

Hopefully this trend continues.\n\nOverall, Equator was great and I plan on coming back in the future. In this part of the city for coffee, morning snacks and a dose of early morning dj to wake you up, this is \"as good as it gets.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

So we walked on into Equator and we were greeted by the beautiful leafy mural on the wall. Super modern, clean cut atmosphere. I noticed that they sell quite a number of food items, wine, and beer. We ordered hot milk tea, scratch caramel latte, and iced house made vanilla latte with cashew milk. The cashew milk was delicious however the cashew flavors are so strong, so I would suggest that if you want to taste the vanilla (or whatever you order) but you're lactose, then you should probably get it with soy. That cashew just overpowers all other flavors. Still really good though! The caramel was also quite delicious. The milk tea was a surprising one to see, but really it is a tea latte and not those asian milk teas you think of. They put in a sprig on some kind of herb which made the whole thing very floral. This is definitely a solid coffee spot if you're in the neighborhood!", "author": "Maleah M."}

I recently started working around the corner from Equator and was pretty happy to run into it one day before work. \n\nThey open earlier than everyone else. It is always really clean and upbeat. There's always a seat open before work (because most of the crowd are grab-n-go). And the workers are pretty down-to-earth and friendly, but not the fake kind of friendly. \n\nAnd the coffee on it's own (I always get the latte) is really good quality. Nothing is over roasted and the foam is done just right. I've also tried their cheddar and chives scone, which was just the right amount of moistness and saltiness.\n\nAlso--really dig the kitteh stickers. Pretty dope. Hoping they don't notice I take one like, every, time. If they do, they're pretty chill about it!\n\nOne of my other favorite things about the place is they don't chase off or call the police on the many homeless people in the area. That's a rare and humane quality in downtown San Francisco and I really appreciate it. It is probably part of the company culture because the business is supposed to be built on low-impact type ethics.

So, when I had some time to kill in SF, I was excited to finally go to one of their shops, which happened to be this one on Market.  It's a small location with a few seats inside and outside.  You can't hold the small size against them as reality in SF is stupid expensive!  (And they are in a prime location!)  I was on a tight budget at the time, so chose to go for a cup of brewed coffee.  I knew it wouldn't taste as good as a pour over, and at $2.75 which is cheaper than most specialty coffee shops, I was slightly apprehensive about how good it would taste... but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of flavor that it carried for being \"brewed coffee\" and not a \"pour over.\"  \nThe shop was clean, and had a cool look to it.  Other reviews mention flies... I was also there on a hot day, and didn't experience any flies, so maybe they fixed the problem?  There are some outlets inside and free wifi, which was great as I needed to get some work done on my laptop.  They had some free samples available of some pastries, which were delicious.  Their pastry and food options look great... I need to come back when I'm not on such a tight budget! haha.  The baristas were friendly when I ordered... I only gave 4/5 stars as I felt they lacked that top-notch, homey-feel, customer service you get in your local coffee shops... but given their location it's understandable, and it was still good customer service.  Next time I'm in SF, I will definitely be back!", "author": "Eric D."}

So we decided to go across the street and grab coffees and pastries from the newly opened Equator.\n\nBrewed Coffee: Tasted normal. I guess you can't really taste \"free-trade\" or \"organic\" in coffee... so I don't know what I expected? Also, there's organic cashew milk that you can pour into it, which is interesting because I've never tried cashew milk. Stick with the normal milk or cream though.\n\nArepas: We got the candied pecan. Very sweet. Very small. Tasted unhealthy and not worth it. \n\nWhite cheddar and mushroom croissant: Meh. Wasn't warmed up and just tasted absolutely mediocre. Guess I won't be trying Sandbox bakery anytime soon. That being said, I spent the entire week in a croissant fiending mode and tried a new croissant shop every morning. This was not the worst (focaccia on 8th and Mission is). \n\nNot sure if I'll be back. Expensive for what it was.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

They were smart to get really good at roasting before trying to operate cafes, which is the opposite of what a lot of local coffee companies do. \n\nVery careful pour-over technique resulting in perfect cups of coffee via Hario V60 paper filter drip cones on scales. \nHigh points for offering really good pour-over decaf. This decaf Ethiopian was so good, I was skeptical it was even decaf. The regular pour-over Ethiopian was also delicious. \nI appreciate how this roaster roasts a little more medium than places like Four Barrel. The single origin coffee is bright and clear without being mouth-puckeringly sour. \n\nThe people working here were friendly and helpful - not coffee snobs at all. \nThanks to Equator for making high quality coffee more accessible.", "author": "RK W."}

I used to come almost every single afternoon for a large chai latte because Equator makes by far the best chai latte I have ever tasted -- and I have tasted a few. It was also the most expensive I had ever tasted -- $4.75 per cup. More expensive than any local cafe by a dollar or more. Worth it to me. \nAlas, when they raised their coffee prices a few months ago to reflect the sharp rise in the price of coffee beans, they decided to raise price of the chai lattes as well. I'm not sure why. I guess because they thought they could get away with it. I suppose they probably have. But it really irritated me. It sounds absurd to quit a cafe over a 25 cent price hike, but it also seems greedy to hike the price of an already ridiculously expensive drink by 25 cents. I suddenly felt like a chump and just like that I stopped drinking Equator chai lattes. I never even think about going in there any more and after the first few days, I have not missed my afternoon drink. I am probably a little skinner and am definitely a little richer. However! If you want to try a great chai latte, this is the place. And it's a nice place, very comfortable and popular and people who love coffee love this coffee. There you have it, my mixed review.", "author": "Jennifer R."}
