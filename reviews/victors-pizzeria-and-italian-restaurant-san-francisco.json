I had driven past it for many years and always wondered about it.  \nMy friend and I were headed to Erasure concert at the Masonic and met up at Victor's for dinner and drinks.  I'm so glad she chose this spot.\nIt smells so good as you walk in the door.  \nThe restaurant is charmingly old school: the decor, the plates, utensils and glassware. Reminds me of an old place like Caesar's.\nThe portions are GENEROUS. I am a pretty cheap gal, and I approve of their pricing.  We had chicken parmigiana $19 which comes with soup or salad, bread & butter, small plate of pasta bolognese, huge hunk of chicken parmigiana and vegetables. It was delicious!\nWe also ordered Victor's speciality pizza. DELICIOUS! The right amount of crust, left in the oven the right amount of time. The toppings were generous and yummy.\nWe also had glasses of merlot. Nice generous pour-- like how you'd pour yourself a glass of wine at home.\nOur waitress was friendly and chatty.. not too much, and gave us the right amount of attention.  You could spend hours there and not feel rushed. \nMy friend treated me to this place, and I'm grateful she brought me there.\nGo check this place out. I'll see you there.", "author": "Lita T."}

In addition a light coat of pizza sauce, light amount of mozzarella cheese, and pre saut\u00e9 vegetables would make them delicious.\n\nI would encourage employees to be grateful for customers since they are them that make it possible for us to make our living.", "author": "Oswaldo M."}

Decided to come here because I saw the 4-star rating on Yelp and lots of super-positive reviews, and I was craving some good pizza. \n\nThey allow you to buy pizza by the slice, but you need to take it to-go and they won't let you sit inside if you only buy by-the-slice.

But my latest meal, I had the famous \"Zorba\" Special pizza. For $17.00, the small 12-inch pizza comprised of Cheese, salami, pepperoni, black olives, tomato, feta cheese, and onions. This is the restaurant's famous pizza and clearly one of my favorites. \n\nMy pizza was delivered in about 25 minutes. And my pizza was still temperature-hot. On Eat24, there is a $15.00 minimum order with an additional $3.00 delivery fee when you order here. \n\nThis is my first time using the Eat24 website, and having my dinner delivered to my crib.

They allow you to buy your pizza by the slice which could not be better suited for this audience. The restaurant seems to be take out only, there was no place to sit and eat.\n\nWas their pizza amazing? It was okay, what made it great was the ability to balance your alcohol-food level after visiting other places around. It also prevents you from going hangry later at night. \n\nWhat pizza do they have?

We asked for water and found that the water tasted really funky. No matter, we figure it was just weird tap water and ordered the pizza. We got the victors special large to split for 6 (which actually worked out for our entire party) and they cut the pizza into 10 slices. The victors special came loaded with sausage, salami, olives, green bell pepper, onion, and pepperoni. The flavor of the pizza was good but the crust was definitely burnt. It was not \"Neapolitan\" style where some of the burnt pieces actually compliment the crust. The crust was hard and cardboard-like, but luckily the ingredients on top helped make it palatable.\n\nThe main reason for the low rating is the sketchiness of the management. I inquired about the 10% off deal from the Yelp check in and an older gentlemen behind the counter (which I assume to be a manager or possible owner? after seeing how he talked with the other associates) said sorry, the check in deal is only for to-go orders. I go back to my table and re-read the check in deal offer and found that it was in fine print....\"10% off ONLY FOR DINE-IN Orders\". Confused, I go back to the same person and showed him the check in deal. He reads it out loud and then tells me again \"Sorry, it should be only for to-go orders\"\n\nSo beware of using your Yelp check in deal, but otherwise the associates were friendly, restaurant was clean, and the pizza was OK.", "author": "Jason Y."}

Upon entering this establishment, the owner barked \"Go sit back there!\" Sat ourselves and the server brought us 5 glasses filled with... yellowish water? One had something crusty at the bottom (yes it was inside the glass) and another (aka mine) had a hair in it. The cheese on the pizza was stretchy and weird and did not taste like normal cheese. This place is pretty memorable, but not for good reasons. A hilarious New Years Eve memory of bad service, not so great food, and hairy & crusty water glasses. Sometimes places are just so bad that you have to laugh about it.", "author": "Miranda W."}

The pastas are very one-note and very heavy tomato-ey.  The rigatoni bolognese tasted like your standard cheap Italian pasta dish at a diner of some sort.  Big portions, but I'm not sure I wanted that much mediocre pasta!\n\nThe pizzas are pretty enjoyable, but if you get one of the special pizzas, you cannot substitute. I think next time I would go with a make your own but the Victor's Special was really good.  I think if you order in the restaurant or through Eat24 you have to order the whole pizza, but if you walk in, they do have individual slices for purchase. My guess is they will sell you whatever slices they have in the window in the front.\n\nThe soups are meh but the dinners come with soup or salad, so at least that's nice.  The salad is ok, but the Italian dressing is super tart!  I think I would go with another dressing next time but the veggies were fresh (albeit lots of iceberg lettuce).\n\nI'd come back but I think for the pizzas only.  The pasta was an experiment but if you want pasta, go the extra 15 minutes into north beach and get real pasta.  If you just want pizza, this one will do just fine.\n\nWARNING FOR DELIVERY: they charge $3 for delivery and then the delivery guy will demand a tip, and if you get the same one I got, he's not even very friendly.  Not a good experience.", "author": "Traci H."}

My pepperoni came out limp and bland - but that could also be because they don't use the good pepperoni. But the pizza itself was actually pretty good. They make a darn good chewy crust, and with the sauce and cheese it really hits the spot. \n\nSo forget about the topping and stick to a plain cheese slice. BTW, it's huge.

He then continued to place the container of tainted pepperoni onto the table with the other toppings where they prepare the pizzas. (I guess this guy believes in the five second rule.) Needless to say I was aghast.\n\nHe then continued to go about his business and, when he realized I had been standing there the entire time and witnessed what he had done, became very nervous and embarrassed and immediately made a show of retrieving the container of floor pepperoni and throwing it into the garbage! The pepperoni which had come into direct contact with the floor and which he had painstakingly collected and put back into the container! The pepperoni which he had intended on serving to his customers! Needless to say I was appalled and disgusted and immediately walked out!!! No food poisoning for me, thank you very much! I wonder if he retrieved the pepperoni out of the garbage after I left...\n\nNot cool-This is San Francisco baby! We don't play that here!

We were seated and it was kind of dark in the dining room. Service was very attentive though. I had the minestrone soup I think. It was pretty good. I didn't like the fact that they kept the bay leaf in the soup, that's inedible. I believe we both had a sausage sandwich which came with a side of spaghetti. It was a pretty good hole in the wall, not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back. Also, their yelp menu is not updated because it had an item not on the current menu.

While they initially quoted 45 minutes at 10:30 pm on a Saturday night, I do vaguely remember holding the warm box of pizza and delightfully chilled soda by 10:55.

The chicken part is good but sauce is too acidic or tomatoey as another said ha. \n\nDelivery driver is whack tho. Left $4 for a $40 order the first night. I normally tip cash and needed to break a $20. He asked how much I needed back rather than giving me 10, 5,  and 1s. I said 16 and he tried to give and ask if 12 was OK when I said I can have the lobby break it. Then he magically came up with the missing scrill. Doesn't say thank you and walks off. Didn't really like him. Next night same guy but the order is 70. Food comes in paper bags that aren't easy to handle. Ask if there's ketchup and he says yes. Left a $3 tip cuz he doesn't deserve it but first thing he does is count the money. Then he scoffs and says it's not enough while waiting around a little top long saying I should call Yelp to add more. I told him it's all I had and walked away.

You can watch everyone working together in perfect beat to get the pizza's out. \n\nThe pizza itself is phenomenal. Every time I order from them it arrives fast, hot, and perfectly cooked. You can visibly see the tufts of steam rising off the pizza when you open the box. The cheese and crust are never burnt. It's not greasy. (This is a BIG plus for me, I hate having to soak up pools of grease off the top of pizza slices with a napkin. This has never been the case with Victors.) The toppings are fresh. The sauce has a nice zesty herbal flavor. The bread is crisp. I even eat the crusts which I usually never do at other pizza places. These guys know what they're doing and they do it well.\n\n I read a complaint on yelp that they have an attitude, but that's not the case. They have never been rude to me.

You also get your choice of a generous side salad with meats and cheese (their ranch is perfection), or minestrone soup which I don't like on its own, but is fantastic when mixed with chicken broth.\n\nI like their vegetarian lasagna (spinach, ricotta, and mozzarella) but not the overly tart sauce it comes with. The pasta with burro sauce is oily and flavorless. The meatballs aren't very good and the po' boys are awful. But seriously, the chicken dishes rock.\n\nI appreciate how easy ordering is. They answer the phone and take orders quickly, and you don't have to recite your card number for them (the driver scans it). Our food usually arrives in around 30 minutes. If I'm just getting a slice, I'll go to Bellissimo. But when we want to do a regular meal (with pizza on the side, of course), it's Victor's.", "author": "Lauren C."}

I opted for the minestrone soup. The guy on the phone was a bit difficult to understand, but I did understand that it would be 15 minutes.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later, but still had to wait another 10 minutes for the food to come out. It ended up being $15.15 for so-so food. The chicken marsala was pretty good. The mushrooms were thick cut and yummy, the marsala wine was good enough to sop up with the complimentary bread rolls, but the chicken cutlets were a bit overcooked. The side of vegetables were WAY overcooked to the point of mush that a baby could have eaten. The pasta was decently good, actually. The noodles were actually al dente and the meat sauce had some good flavor to it. I didn't try the minestrone on account of being too full, but it looked like a basic tomato based soup with some mushy noodles.", "author": "Leslie H."}

On a night like tonight when I actually got out of work early (10:30 pm instead of 11) it made perfect sense for me to go to Victor's for my late night supper.  You know how it is; sometimes going home and cooking dinner at midnight seems like such a big hassle.\n\nI often order pasta at Victor's because their menu allows you to match your favorite pasta with your favorite sauce, but I went a different route tonight as I decided to try their meat lasagna instead.  Soup or salad comes with the pastas and fresh baked miniature loaves of bread.  I chose the minestrone because it has been brutally cold outside lately.\n\nThe big bowl of tomato-based soup was hot and hearty with big chunks of potatoes, carrots, celery and strips of soft pasta. Plain and simple their \"homemade\" bread is made with the same dough used on their pizza crusts.  If you like the pizza crust at Victor's you'll like the bread.  I happen to love Victor's pizza.  Like miniature loaves of French bread there is a nice outer crust with warm, soft, chewy but yet still airy bread on the inside.  It's perfect with the softened cube of butter that accompanies it.\n\nThe lasagna was one of the best I've had in a very long time.  A meat lover's delight is what it really is with lots of ground meat mixture sandwiched in between soft layers of pasta then covered with a thick layer of mozzarella that stretches forever, and finally smothered with a chunky tomato and meat pasta sauce with whole bay leaves mixed in.  The lasagna is fantastic.  The lasagna is delicious.\n\nI didn't have any on this visit, but I've always enjoyed the pizza with its tasty, chewy crust, thick cheese and fresh ingredients that you can view at the front window or from the front counter.  It's perfect with an ice cold bottle of Peroni or just your favorite soft drink.  The wait service is excellent and friendly as well.\n\nTake your food to go or eat in.  There are two different dining areas.  A darkly lit room has booth seating throughout while a brighter room has tables and chair seating.  I can't explain it though; I enjoy sitting on the dark side.  Maybe it's just different or maybe it's just fun to hold your lit cell phone up to your food just to see what you are eating.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I asked for a slice for here and asked for a water cup. He never told me that slices cannot be eaten inside the restaurant (which only had one table filled) Regardless I'm a paying customer and should be allowed to eat in the establishment. \nI pointed to empty tables and said it really only takes a few minutes to eat a slice, he then aggressively points at a sign on the table that says slices are to go only. I've never been to a pizza joint that forces you to eat on the sidewalk, especially when the place was empty! I then asked if I can have a box and he very rudely said no! you can have a bag! Well I drive a scooter, I need a box so it doesn't slide all over underneath my seat.\n\nMy advice if they are going to strictly enforce this dumb rule that slices are to go only, is verbally tell your paying customers this is the policy. I left feeling disrespected and second class. When I was in line I even saw a pizza pop out of the oven and asked him how much would a slice of that pizza be and he said \"those are for customers\" very cold. Like I could visually see a difference if this particular pizza is for slices or a party that ordered. Hopefully this place has enough paying customers but I wont be one of them.\n\nHe really was clueless on how to treat someone who's giving you money!

The crust is thin and crisp, the sauce is neither too bitter nor too sweet, and the toppings are always top notch. The customer service is always lovely; what I don't understand here is how some Yelpers claim this place is staffed by \"rude people.\" The head waiter (who has served us each time we've visited) has been nothing but professional and polite with us each time, and he remembers us well. Maybe it's because we don't get slices \"to go\" and try eating them at a table when there are signs that explicitly tell you not to. We always eat in.

I ordered the Victor's Special, which comes with a lot of stuff, but less of everything would have been more, in terms of quality. I also ordered meatballs. They were good, but quickly dissolved into the bolognese sauce they were served in, so it was kind of like a pint of very meaty bolognese. Also, I was served two Bay leaves. I'm from the school of thought that you shouldn't serve anything that isn't edible  and bay leaves are not edible. Eat one and report back. Lastly, the fish and chips were terrible. Now, I understand, when you order fish and chips from a pizza joint, you shouldn't expect the world, but these were extremely sub-par. I actually think the fish came in a box. Perhaps with a logo of a man in a bright yellow poncho. \n\nOn the upside, delivery was prompt, everything was fresh and hot, and the driver did not attempt to knock on my door, as per my request.

I don't usually write reviews and  usually won't say anything unless I have something nice to say but the little guy behind the counter is so rude that I would never eat here again. \n\nMy friend and I walked in and ordered a pepperoni and combination pizza. We waited about 5 mins which is fine because they had to REHEAT the cold cheese pizza that was displayed in the window (which was also fine). We went to the back to wait and a few mins later I got up to check on our pizzas. I asked the little guy if the slice on the counter was ours and he replied \"yes\" so I grabbed it and began to walk to the back...I then hear from him \"HEY, leave the pizza HERE!!\" I asked if I could just bring it to her because she wanted to put some cheese on her pizza and he wouldn't even let me step foot in the back room and kept repeating slices only for take out! If the place was packed then we could understand the \"rule\" but the place was pretty much empty. When I walked back to my friend she told me the other little guy with greasy hair wearing a green shirt (wannabe jersey shore douchelord) told her that we can't eat in the \"restaurant\" because we ONLY bought slices of pizza and dine in was only for people who ordered off the \"Italian\" menu. Ha, good one \"Italian\"...........I would say a packet of Korean ramen with Ikea meatballs are more Italian than this place. Anyway......\n\nAfter we both got our pizzas and my friend finally put some cheese on her pizza. My pizza just so happen to fall face down on the floor in which the little guy said nothing...which is fine too. I took it as a sign of the gods telling me not to eat the crap coming from this place!

I had dinner there one recent night, and everything was fine.  I was alone (in town for business), and was seated promptly at a comfy table.   Drink and food orders were taken (and served) promptly.  Food was fine.  I had the chicken parmesan dinner.  Salad was tasty with fresh veggies.  An unexpected side of pasta was plunked on my table at one point.  (It was not mentioned on menu, at least not that I noticed.  Unfortunately, it was served with meat sauce.  I do not eat beef and so this side went untouched.)  The chicken itself was served with veggies instead of pasta (the standard at many places) and I was glad for this as it made the meal a bit lighter.  The veggies (zucchini and carrots) on first glance looked liked they might have been boiled to death; but, they had a surprising amount of life/crispness left to them.  The (non-meat) sauce that accompanied the chicken was rich and flavorful  I had no problems with my meal or the service.\n\nThe problem came a few days later when I checked my charge card activity on-line.  At Victor's, I left a 20% tip, which, last time I looked, was considered perfectly reasonable.  The good folks at Victor's, though, apparently, decided it was not enough.  My statement showed a final charge that reflected a nearly 30% tip.  If these people feel I did not leave a high enough tip, they are allowed to call me cheap.  They are allowed to spit in my food the next time I eat there (which, clearly, will be never).  They are not allowed, though, to steal from me, which, by helping themselves to a higher-than-I-left tip, is what they are doing.  If they actually altered the charge slip that I signed to make it appear I authorized this charge in this amount, they are committing fraud.\n\nI was tempted to give two stars instead of one only because I did enjoy my food and the waiter who took my order/brought my food/etc. (and provided perfectly fine service in doing so) had disappeared by the time the bill arrived.  A second waiter (perhaps manager?) brought my bill and charge slip.  I assume he is responsible for helping himself to a dollar and change more than I intended to leave.

I cannot eat this sausage lover's slice because it goes against everything I believe\" are not phrases I'd want to hear on a daily basis, either. But come on. Pizza is not like fro-yo.

I moved to Marin in my teens, and  I've tried literally dozens of pizza/Italian restaurants in the Bay Area over the past 20-plus years. Victor's Pizza is the BEST pizza I've ever tried! It's a very bold statement to make and I thought about it for a very long time. But why hesitate! It really is the best! Half of what makes a great pizza is the dough. Their dough is the perfect thickness, texture and flavor. It compliments their sauce, which is very tangy and delicious with just enough seasoning without overwhelming. Also, the ingredients they use, especially the cheese, is top quality and fresh! If you love pizza, you'll love Victor's Pizza! The reason I gave it 4-stars rather than 5 is because I felt their prices are slightly steeper than a pizza should be. An extra-large with two toppings on only half cost me over $30! I also had a slice to go since I had a 40-minute drive ahead of me. It cost $4.25. That still won't stop me, but rather than visit as often as once a week, it'll have to be one a month, or so.", "author": "Joseph R."}

How does one choose? 4-star rating, that's how. It's a well deserved rating. Walking in the aroma of Italy will embrace you. The atmosphere is simple, no frills. Everyone greeted us walking in. They have a small dining room, but has room for a large group if they're not busy. The front was very busy with pizza orders the whole time we were there. It must be good. I saw single guys, families, business people in suits. The server showed up in a couple minutes, checked on us throughout.  I appreciate the short menu: pizza, of course, a list of pastas and sauce choices, a section of entr\u00e9es and house specials. There are several salad options and a short list of starters. They offer a handful of beers and wines. The table starts with fresh bread and butter. Water is served ice cold. Only one free refill. I appreciate this. We're in a drought and it shouldn't be wasted. We started with the garlic bread with cheese. So full of garlicky goodness on fresh bread. I ordered Spinach Gnocchi in garlic sauce. It is AMAZING  (if you truly enjoy garlic). Meals come with your choice of soup or salad and are roughly $15 per plate. I had minestrone. I don't usually care for minestrone but I have to say this is the only minestrone I've ever liked. Licked that bowl. We also ordered the chicken parmigiano. Before the meal, a starter of spaghetti arrived. The chicken was piping hot. The sauce is full of flavor. Dipped the bread in the sauce. Licked the plate. Two thumbs up.", "author": "Renee F."}

Although I personally never order Hawaiian pizza (eh brah, nothing wrong with it, but come on cuz, fo us folks dat wen grow up in da islands, you no can say a pizza is \"hawaiian\" just because you wen throw some pineapple on top of one pizza. . . sorry, I felt the need to bus out some of my pidgin there, but it's true), I do have to admit this was probably the best I've had so far.  \n\nThe crust is really thin, so if you like that, this place is for you, no doubt.  The Hawaiian pizza we ordered had ham which was not in chunks but more like slices, which I prefer more, and small chunks of pineapple.  The sauce and cheese were just right.  \n\nFriends and I debated if we should get the large or x-large, but since they hadn't eaten anything all day, we decided on the XL, thinking we'd have some for leftovers, but there was nothing to take back: it was so good all three of us ate the whole thing.

I ordered delivery from Victors and the service was prompt I ordered two pastas and two sandwiches.  These came with bread, 3 salads, and 1 soup.  The food looked great, huge pasta portions and mediocre size sandwiches.  My roomate quickly scarfed his salad down.  I went to the fridge to get extra dressing because mine was pretty dry.  Immediately after pouring the dressing, 5 -10 fruit flies rose from the chinese food box.  I went to the next salad hoping it was mistake, but no, there was a dead fly on top of my the cheese.  \n\nDisgusted I called to get my money back.  1st after admitting they had a fruit fly problem, they asked me if I wanted another salad!  Why the f would I want another salad after you just admitted having a fruit fly problem, and Im sorry but thats not a problem thats a reason to be shutdown!!!!!.  After which I demanded my money back, he asked if I was going to give the food back...  1.  If the food wasn't tainted I would have happily ate it because Im still hungry writing this....  2.  For you to talk to me as if this is some sort of scam to get free food is completely offensive, and of course after finding fruit fly's in my food Im not going to eat it you moron!!!!  So he told me he would send his delivery guy.\n\nHe arrived promptly again which was a plus because I was getting more frustrated by the minute.  When he arrived I opened the box to show him, and his reaction was why I am writing this yelp.  He had the audacity to tell me that some people mistake broken down mushrooms for fruit flys!!!  I about threw the food in the street.  How dare you question my interpretation of what a fruit fly is or looks like and mushrooms do not have wings!!  And what kind of idiot questions the customer after admitting to the problem??  Ever hear the phrase the customer is always right?? \n\nSo Im going to sum this up.  If your looking for a large portion of over priced crap (putting it lightly) in a box  delivered promptly call, Victors.  They'll be happy to admit they have a problem with fruit flies and then demand the food back so they can resell it to some unknowing less observant individual.  Then they will promptly send some jerk off over to refund your money and insult your intelligence upon receiving the uneaten tainted food.  \n\nThank you Victors for inspiring this terrible review.  Im sure to some this will be very amusing.  But I am not, and I get no satisfaction from this and honestly Im pissed I had to waste the time.

I've always driven by and wondered, so I decided to try a slice. While the three slices remaining looked like they've been out for hours...I said \"why not.\" The cheese pizza was good, it was heated thoroughly and the crust had a nice thin crunch, but it was missing the chewyness too. The cheese was fresh, and there was a nice amount of italian seasonings and other stuff on top. However, still no go for me. I think Escape From New York Pizza is better. I wanted to like Victor's, but I was just disappointed.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

However, I can only review based on my experience- and it sucked.\n\nA friend and I rolled by one night to grab a quick slice after I had just moved into the neighborhood. It took us a good 5 minutes to order 2 slices each. 10 minutes later, when they were finally ready, we got our slices and proceeded to grab a table when we were told that we couldn't sit down- apparently the tables are for \"sit-down diners only.\" WTF? We're here to dine and we want to sit down- what does that make us? We just purchased 2 slices each and you wont even let us grab a seat to eat them in? Not to mention the fact that the place was empty. Literally. The place was full of tables and chairs and only one of them had a couple finishing up dinner.\n\nBeing from NY, I was kinda pissed that I couldn't enjoy a slice of pizza while sitting down- unheard of in NY from a place that advertises pizza by the slice (where it's understood that if you order a slice, you should be able to sit down and enjoy it if there are tables and chairs available). I told the guy behind the counter that it's not right, to which he basically gave me a dirty look and told me (in other words) to go fuck myself.\n\nThat's the people and the service.\n\nTo top it off, the pizza was shit. And I'm not just saying that because the staff were a bunch of assholes. Nor am I just saying that because I'm from NY and think our pizza's the holy grail of pizzas. I've been to a lot of pizza joints in cities all over the world, and this pizza sucked. It tasted worst than the old-school frozen pizzas that used to only be available in slices before brands like DiGiorno came out with somewhat edible frozen pies. The sauce tasted funky and the cheese was nasty. It pretty much tasted like homemade pizza straight out of the microwave.\n\nPROS:\n- None\n\nCONS:\n- Shitty service\n- Even shittier staff\n- And even shittier pizza\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nStay away. There are much better pizza joints around the area. There's probably much better Italian food as well.", "author": "Mr. P."}

I had passed by this place for years, occasionally ducking in for a slice or two to go before heading out to the location of my next bout of drunken shenanigans. The slices to go only clause never bothered me as I find pizza a highly transportable food. But one evening not too long ago I broke down and actually found myself dining inside. \n\nA friend of mine and I have been having some boy problems and were up for a pity party table for two. Seriously, a bitchery-pitchery session* can only be capped off with something hot and gooey. We went for a half veggie, half meaty large or extra large and a pitcher of beer for optimum comforting purposes. Yeah we'd take a slice of each and fold them over like some ridiculous over stuffed sandwich. Yeah holy yum yums, we stopped complaining and started shoveling in uber fresh toppings.

I tend to eye the delivery guy suspiciously, as if he's going to hand me a box of half-cooked pizza dough and raw ingredients and make a run for it. I wonder if Vic's, King Lee's, and other speedy spots I'm unaware of share the rapid-delivery tunnels amicably or if there's a whole \"Mad Max\" situation going on right under our feet. \"Food\" for thought! (Double snare. Cymbal. Blech.)\n\nThe other great thing about Victor the Slickster's is that it is consistently good. Victor comes to play every single game; there are no nights off.

You can taste the difference.  I also had the pleasure one morning walking to work and seeing their guys working the morning shift (before opening) baking & preparing bread and pasta dough.  THIS IS VERY OLD SCHOOL.\n\nPASTA: these guys are doing fresh made pasta, with the nice chewy texture that comes with it, every day, and at bargain basement prices.  You can't beat this.\n\nPizza: this is NY/NJ style pizza without the marketing & pretension you'd expect when someone tries to reproduce it here in California.  Even heretical forms of pizza (Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham) are done beautifully.  \n\nThe Red Sauce: the heart of their pizza and pasta dishes.  Get anyone of the marinara dishes, taste the sauce without touching the pasta.  Notice a kind of subtle sweetness?  This isn't from adding sugar to the sauce.  This is from using sweet tomatoes -- maybe canned San Marzano's.  I don't know where they got them -- but I'm glad they use them.\n\nThe only negatives, needs a wider beer selection.

I now have a new favorite local pizza joint.\n\n(let me preface this by saying I'm a NorCal native, so take that FWIW)\n\nWhen I first moved here a few years ago, I tried Cybelle's on Bush (from a co-worker's reccomendation), and it was pretty frickin good, so I stuck with them for my periodic pizza needs. \n\nLater on, I discover yelp, and based on the \"OMFG THIS IS REAL NY PIZZA, AND I'M FROM NY!!!!!\" reviews for Vito's, I try them.  OMFG IF THIS IS REAL NY PIZZA, NY PIZZA SUCKS.  Seriously, if this \"reminds you of 'real' pizza from back East\", I'd be reluctant to eat pizza out East.  Maybe it was the bad luck of the draw, but nothing about it made me want to try it again.  \n\nFurther on down the line, I try the Front Room, and it's pretty decent, and goes in to the rotation with CoB....until a few times later, and they dump the entire bin of cheese on my pizza, so there's literally a centimeter of cheese on the damn thing.  I like cheese and all, but that was just damn gross.   OK, one goof, but same thing the next time I try them.  Aaaaand they're out of the rotation (and apparently going out of biz too...)\n\nBack to my CoB staple, then after reading the yelp raves for Victor's, decide to give it a try.   Get the pizza delivered in under half an hour, and hesitantly start chomping down on my first slice.  A few minutes later, I look back in the box in horror, realizing I just inhaled half a large pizza.\n\nDamn that was good.\n\nPerfect thin (but not too thin so it gets insta-soggy) crust, not too much/little sauce/cheese, decent quality toppings, and some spices thrown on top of it too for a nice little touch.  Sure there's no fancy shmancy website to order online, no printed menus with their delivery pizzas, no computerized big brother tracking system so they can look up your address from your phone #, no foo foo virgin albino  mongolian yak cheese topping, but it's still a damn good pizza.  If this is what a \"real NY pizza\" is, booyah.\n\n---update 5/07---\nOkay, I've ordered from here a few times now, and it's never been as crispy good as that first time.  WTF.  One time, I ordered a pie with spinach, and it was soggy.  Fine, my bad for trying to be healthy.  Back to standard toppings the next time, and it's not soggy, but nothing really special.  Order again, and same thing.  I'm starting to think that first time, I was luckily the first (and/or only) delivery, since it was OMGWTFBBQ perfect with a crispy (not burnt/crusty/crunchy/dry) crust, and on subsequent times, it took longer to get here.  I guess it's back to the old toaster oven reheat for the good semi-fresh crust.  Minus one star for lack of consistency.", "author": "T C."}

Wife and I split a Victors Favorite which was mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, and salami.  The pepperoni and salami were big slices and tasty and the sausage was nice and spicy.  The sauce was tangy without being overpowering, and just the right amount was added.  The crust was thin, yet held up to the toppings, and the outside crust got nice and crisp in the hot hot oven.  My wife had a view into the kitchen and saw the pizza being made, excited that they just weren't thrown in until a buzzer went off, instead the cook checked, prodded, and repositioned until it was done to perfection.  Only complaint was that the soda refills aren't free.  I know how cheap fountain soda syrup is so I'm always a little irked at places that charge for soft drink refills but that won't stop me from coming back.", "author": "Jonny S."}

The service was on point, even for our large rowdy and loud table! The prices of the entrees are so reasonable, and everyone was super stoked on whatever they ordered. \nThe decor is super cheesy and awesome; we were graced with the amazing addition of Christmas decorations for that extra WOW factor.

Hubster liked it though.\n\nThe servings are hefty here, it looked like I hardly made a dent in mine but had to unbutton my pants at the movies all the same. I sampled a bit of TB's ravioli and the pesto was really good, very garlicky and green. Hubster demolished his lasagna and I didn't even see Hot's sammich before he ate it all. Everyone seemed pleased with the food.\n\nTook a while to get the check but that was really the only downside of the meal. Everything else was super.\n\nLots of take out orders during our 2 hours there and quite a few families came in for dinner.\n\nThe bathroom was through the kitchen (which I hate, always afraid I'm going to slip and fall) and it was a bit dingy and dank, nothing too bad though.", "author": "Christine K."}

Victor's:1, Competitors with giant soggy garlic bread slices: 0\n\nPizza: nice size with feta spread evenly and not chuncked up.

I love the bread they give you with your soup or salad.  I think the secret at victor's is they have awesome crust.  It is seriously some of the best crust I've ever had.  This is definitely a birthday dinner destination, they cater well to large rowdy groups of people.  And, like my old neighborhood favorite pizza place, Bella, they are always kickin' out the soft rock jams with KOIT!

After I graduated from college, I didn't think it would be difficult to find another place with pizza just as good as the local joint in my small college town - especially since I was moving to Chicago, a city famous for it's pizza.\n\nWell, I was wrong.  I was so displeased with Chicago style pizza and their many failed attempts at doing NY style pizza.  I was praying that I would be able to find a good place once I moved to SF (I should note that my move from Chicago was not due to their lousy pizza - obviously).\n\nVictor's Pizza has proven that one can get big wonderful slices of heaven even after college (so long as you're not in Chicago!)  My only request when I order from here is that they go easy on the oregano b/c sometimes I find it overpowers the delicious cheesiness.  Thank you San Francisco and Victor's!", "author": "Julia J."}

I have been stopping by Victor's for a slice of pizza for a very long time.  Granted it's not the best pizza by the slice, but it's does the trick.  They also were nice enough to accommodate a large group of us for pizza weeks ago.\n\nSo why the one star you ask.  Well here's the story:\n\nMy friend and I had tickets to see a show.  Unfortunately, work and traffic got in our way and we were unable to attend.  But that wasn't going to stop us from at least trying to have some fun.  We decided we both wanted Italian, something within walking distance and some place where we could have some wine.  Victors was the obvious choice.   We were told to sit anywhere we like.  We chose the darker side of the restaurant where there are these little single type booths.  Now I'm fairly petite but these seats made me feel enormous.  My friend and I quickly changed to the booths in the middle of the restaurant.   Sure we giggled for a bit about the fact that those booths were ridiculous in size, but we were ready to get our food on!  So we order.  I order the rigatoni with bolognese sauce.  She orders the gnocchi with pesto.  We both get a salad (the waiter informs us that a soup or salad comes with the pasta). \n\nFirst we get the salad.  The salad is smothered in dressing.  OK fine...it comes with the meal I say to myself.  Then the entrees arrive.  I ask my friend, because she took a bite of her gnocchi with pesto first, how it is.  She just shrugs her shoulders.  I take a bite of my entree.  My first thought is \"this is the complete opposite of al dente\".  The noodles were so over cooked it wasn't even funny.  The sauce was terrible.  And  I couldn't even taste any meat, except when an occasional big chunk happened to get stuck to one of the mushy noodles.  So I ask my friend \"can I try a bite of yours\"....\"please do\" she responds.  Now the moment the gnocchi entered my mouth I could tell it was on the super soft side.  But within seconds it disintegrated in my mouth like sand.  At this point my friend and I look at each other and say at the exact same moment \"this has to be the worst pasta I have ever had\".  I\"m not joking,  Trust me I wish I was.  Then the garlic bread finally arrives.  Now if I was a vampire slayer this bread would be top on my list to protect me.  But alas I'm not, so I'm not looking for dragon breath just a nice loaf of garlic bread.  Victors failed on everything we ate.  If and when I go back I will only order the pizza.  Never have I tasted such awful food in my life.  I still can't understand how you mess up pasta that badly.\n\nBut what bothers me most of all was that the prices are absolutely ridiculous!!  They charge way way way too much for horrible food.  This restaurant should seriously be featured on that show \"Kitchen Nightmares\".", "author": "Amanda P."}

Anyhow...Victor's is a solid, straight forward, and predictable pizza. I love the crispy crust as it's not too thin and not too thick and doesn't resemble the tase of cardboard in the least (which seams to be the common theme in SF pizza's). Their pizza sauce, which couldn't be anything other than homemade, has a really good zest to it. I'm a huge veggie fan myself so the real test is if the veggies arrive crisp and fresh or mushy and brown and I'm happy to report that the viggies passed the test.

The key to Victor's is they have the pie cooked already and then when you order a slice to go with toppings, they wrap it in foil and toss it back into the oven to cook once again.  Three to five minutes later you have arguably the best slice of pizza in the Polk Gulch.  Perfect for eating while nursing your drunken stupor, or before hitting up the bars.", "author": "Taylor P."}

I do have a problem ordering from people who have the potential of delivering good customer service over the phone, but choose to be assholes anyway (ie Za Pizza).

A friend, my sister and I wandered Polk St at 11pm in search of some good food, and were drawn to the large \"Pizza\" sign. Crossing our fingers that it was decent, we walked in. We definitely were not disappointed. The server was phenomenal; always there exactly when we needed him. Right when we decided what we wanted (the vegetarian pizza) he appeared at our side to take our order. Deathly thirsty, I set my glass, empty of water, down and whoa!! There he was with a pitcher of water, \"May I fill your glass?\" I think maybe he was telepathic or something.... The pizza was done nice and crispy in about 10 minutes. It wasn't the BEST pizza I had ever had, but it was cooked and delivered quickly, fresh tasting and had a good crisp factor; good enough for me to grab for seconds. Thanks Victor.

Do yourself a favor and order Victor's Special, with mushrooms, sausage, peperoni, salami, bell peppers, cheese...etc. Perfectly cooked on a crispy thin crust. I crave this pizza often, and if I lived within a mile of the place I would be as big as the side of a barn! Also love their bolognese sauce, with spaghetti. In fact, I've tried most of their pasta's and not been disappointed, and for the price, which includes salad, is quite budget friendly. I always eat in, as I live to far for take-out. Make sure to insist they seat you in the main dining room instead of the annex to the right, which looks like an afterthought. The main dining room is dark, and cozy, with booths, and candles, as my aversion to bright as day, fluorescent lit restaurants has not diminished. Finally, the wait staff is always extremely friendly, and prompt! One particular waiter has worked there for years, and usually knows what I am going to order before I do, or maybe he's telling me what to order, but never the less, he's never steered me wrong.

Highly recommend getting sausage on the pizza, their sausage is hands down some of the best I've had on pizza. They also deliver on time and decently priced. The one downside is that they don't seem to put enough cheese so there are times when you get just crust and tomato sauce. Adding extra cheese is an option if you're willing to pay for it, but after doing so, I felt that there was too much cheese; it felt like I was just eating solely cheese and when I'm spending most of my time trying to break down giant chunks of cheese in my mouth, that's just not fun (or good).\n\nI have tried their pasta but I can't recall what it was (think it was linguini with white clam sauce) and I didn't finish it because it just wasn't good.

The crust was crispy and had a nice saltiness to it with out being overwhelming. I am sick of places adding too much sugar to their dough or sauce and this sauce was heavy on the oregano but pretty much perfect otherwise. We got half Hawaiian and half Victor's Special (cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, bell pepper, onions, black olives). Both were really good. There was too much sausage for my taste but the pizza was not pooled in grease as a lot of combo pizza with cured meats can be. They do not skimp on toppings either, without making piles of goopy cheese. We WILL be ordering form here again.", "author": "Caitlin S."}

No, today i was interested in a calzone, but was tempted by the breaded chicken on garlic bread because A) that sounds damn good and B) it also came with salad and pasta so was a whole meal for 9 bucks instead of a (probably great) calzone and nothing else. well lets hit it up part by part.\nthe \"pasta\" that came with the sammich was great. it was some weird flat noodle that they probably had just lying around, but their sauce was meaty and just right, no flavor too strong, but all of them present, the meat, tomato, spices.. mmm, even for just dished out pasta it was good and tasted fresh when i finally got it back to work 10 minutes later. 2) the salad, another surprise, a BIG full salad, not just some hot lettuce, first off it was in another container staying cool on its own, and came with meat and cheese and i don't even know.. carrots, celery, mushrooms, tomato, other stuff, all from an included side salad!\noh k. onto the sammich itself... i have to say this is where they lost points. the chicken was fine and tasty, hot, breaded, with yummy melty cheese and it was between garlic bread, but the presentation was terrible, it looked like they had some bread and threw some chicken at it and served it up, the bread was a little overpowering and really the whole thing left a lot to be desired. not because it wasn't made great and with great ingredients but just that it was a terrible contrast to the unexpected surprises and layers of the pasta and salad.", "author": "Raccoon S."}

An institution in Polk Gulch, it's obvious from the pics across from the register that Victor's has been serving pie to the hood long before it was a hood (in the modern vernacular at least). Stepping into the place is a time portal back to 1953, especially if you have a seat in one of the ++ahem++ dining rooms (very loose term of the word). Try and wrap your mind around how many pizzas the oven has baked? I've heard scores of former east coasters swear by Victor's, and while it does rise above the mass of craptacular pizza in SF it falls a bit short on what a good pizzeria should be, a place for amazing pie. Damn the dining area, screw the fact that you have to walk through the dish washing station to use the bathroom, Victor's pizza is simply average. Wait, what's that? My friend's kicking me for forgetting to mention the oregano. He swears that a good pie does NOT have any oregano on it (so a word for the purists out there). Personally, I can live with the oregano (I recently read \"The Paradox of Choice\" and am learning to be more of a \"satisficer\"). Victor's is a pretty good crust and nice sauce (a little too sweet, but again satisficery). The skinny? Good as a fall-back, or for a walking slice. This is the best pizza in the area (about the same quality as Escape From NY in the Haight), so when the pie demon rises and you can't get to Amici's there's always Victor's.", "author": "Rob S."}

I have heard over and over again about how such and such's pizza is as good as East Coast pizza.  While I haven't found the Pepe's (New Haven) of San Francisco, it may actually be the best in the city so far in my experience.  I had their Calzone last time I visited and it was the best I have eaten on the West Coast.  Their pizza has that east coast flavor.

Victor's is one such restaurant.  Invariably, I go to Victor's for the Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich.  The eggplant is always perfectly cooked, sliced nice and thin with no tough skin to deal with, and served on the most amazing crispy-yet-soft homemade (?) roll.  I've been going there for so long and ordering the same item that they always know what I've come for.  The only other item I've eaten here is the calzone, which is also top notch.  Victor's has a way with pizza dough, and their hot pizza dough rolls served in lieu of  regular bread at the table is also incredible.  The atmosphere in the darkened, low-key, former smoking section of the restaurant is a perfect place to relax in a comfy booth and hide the fact that you're pigging out.

My wife and I are young but we were sitting in the restaurant for 10 minutes with the menus when a lady behind us sits down to eat. She is immediately asked for her order soon after her arrival. The waiter then leaves us waiting for more than 10 minutes again probably as he goes and runs to the front to ring the magical bell some more. The pizza had raw onions, cheese was CRAP, the salad was the laziest salad i've seen with carrots the size of hand sized rocks.
