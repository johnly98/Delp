There is no such thing as authentic Mexican restaurants in the city of San Francisco. But as a typical San Francisco taqueria, this El Super Burrito is actually pretty good, much better than almost any taqueria in the Mission District. I just dare order safe dishes--dishes that, I know, won't disappoint me, such as broiled meat dishes, quesadillas, or tacos.\n\nI just had the carne asada dish: the meat was cooked the right way, not dry at all, served with small size onions, guacamole, cream, lettuce, beans, and rice, all for just 12 USD, much better than any other deal offered by most other restaurants in the Polk Gulch area. The lettuce was very fresh, the beans were very well prepared and cooked, and the guacamole was freah, as well. The rice was OK. I enjoyed my meal very much, compared to anything I typically experience in the Mission.", "author": "Raymond F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-21", "description": "I moved to SF about five years ago and have lived a block off of Polk and California since that time.  I moved here for work and early on in my time here I was walking home after a long day.  Those were stressful times and I was craving a solid dinner of comforting Mexican food.  That was my first stop.  I came in, ordered, sat and ate complimentary chips and salsa and went home in retreat.  It was one of the most comforting meals of my life.  The Burrito was big, the salsa was zesty.  I went to bed with a full stomach and my stress was gone.  Man, this place is long overdue for a review from old Adam S.  And, it's pretty deserving of a good review to begin with.  El Super Burrito is a terrific place in the Polk Gulch neighborhood with reliably filling and tasty Mexican food.  I have yet to be disappointed.\n\nIn my book, this place sort of hits my formula for a good Mexican place.  Walk in, counter-ordering.  Good range of menu items with a heavy emphasis on the basics (Tacos, Burritos, Nachos).  Good range of meats to choose from, which are all good quality.  I am a big fan of the Carnitas, the El Pastor and the Chorizo.  There is a cooler full of bottled beer.  And, there is the salsa bar with complimentary chips and salsa - help yourself, within reason.  You can dine in and they'll bring your order to the table, or you can take it out.  It's not a long wait even though everything is cooked to order.  Generous portions.  Reasonable prices.  The guy who is normally on the grill seems to slave away and I think he does a great job - I don't know for sure, but I get the sense that this is a family run place.  It is not pretentious, nor overly divey, and it feels totally authentic while still being in the hustle and bustle of Polk Gulch.  ... and, three blocks from my Fortress of Solitude.  \n\nTraditional Mission-style Burrito.  Go with the Jumbo (lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, cheese, sour cream and guacamole) with your choice of meat.  I like Carnitas.  Al Pastor is good an greasy and the grease is delicious.  Chorizo is spicy!  The Chile Verde is nice and rich.  It's all pretty good.  Leave it half wrapped in the foil and add their salsa.  It's a meal, and the ingredients are balanced right.  I've had the nachos a number of times, and you get a big portion with generous amounts of Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream and Guacamole.  I like them with the Chorizo.  The tacos are pretty good but are not a stand out for this place.  Solid Taco Salad.  And, I'll be honest, there are a lot of other items that are more like entrees and I would imagine that they are pretty good.  Also, the chips and salsa are great and it's nice to grab a little starter and sip on a beer while waiting for take-out.  \n\nHowever many times it appears I've checked in, the number is actually about 25 higher since this predates my Yelping.  It may be more than that.  I really like this place and I will go back.  I wish that it was open longer hours.  I'd love to grad a breakfast burrito on a work day.  And, for what it's worth, they could score some big business if they stayed open late-night in this neck of the woods.  I get the sense that they are a business that stays true to their vision.  Simple, honest Mexican food done well.", "author": "Adam S."}

Nonetheless, it was a really good five dollar quesadilla - super filling too.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of El Super Burrito were the free chips!

But they were out, and I'll be damned if I have to take another bus to the Mission to get it. That's how I ended up getting an $8.50 bowl of Caldo de Res, and it just wasn't the same. Sure, there were big chunks of beef shank that have obviously been sitting in a stock pot for quite some time. Carrots and big hunks of potato they didn't bother to make bite-size. They looked like they used zucchini and cabbage rather than chayote. There was plenty of cilantro and chopped onion (photo: http://bit.ly/1diSo3A).\n\nBut when you're in the mood for menudo, it doesn't quite cut it, at least until I cut one, you should pardon the expression. I needed something to offset my disappointment, so I ordered a $2.50 Super Taco as a chaser. That was a huge mound of shredded lettuce on top of the grilled beef strips with a lonely half-tomato slice on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1gshH1N). It was nearly impossible to pick up, so I started grazing on it like I was a cow. As tacos go, it was pretty decent but nothing that would warrant a special trip on the 19 dodging the meth addicts.

It's what you would (should) expect from a mexican establishment in this part of town. The interior isn't much, but you know what that means - they make DAMN GOOD FOOD. \n\nYes, most of the time I order their namesake, but there is a reason for that. For $7-8 you can get an amazing swaddle of meat, beans, rice, cheese, and everything else that warms your stomach and your heart as quickly as sodium can distribute through your arteries. Just kidding, it's not really that salty, I just like to add salt to my chips and snack on them relentlessly while I wait for my order. Yes, there are chips that you can self serve in the back. They also have a couple of good salsas, and their spicy one really is VERY hot. I was impressed, as I am one of those foolish people who enjoys the burning tingle on my lips. \n\nTheir quesadillas are also pretty good, and I have ordered the tostada de ceviche once and it was piled with seafood! Stomach and wallet are happy, so I am too.\n\nSo come here for some good Mexican food if you are tired of Taco Bell a couple of streets down.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Decided to go with the namesake, the Super Burrito, which was your choice of meat (carne asada, pollo, carnitas, al pastor, lengua, chile verde, chorizo, cabeza, or BBQ chicken), rice, beans, guacamole, cheese, and sour cream, and I got it wet (smothered in a sauce and you could choose cheese & tomatillo or enchilada... I went with enchilada). I also ordered the California Fries, which were one of today's specials which are fries covered in the meat of your choice then cheese then all that covered in guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. And a Mandarin Jarritos, because when you can drink Jarritos, you should. I was also told to get the salsa because it was described to me as \"good enough to just drink on its own\". And so I got little cups of all three.\nThe burrito was beyond amazing. Truly super. Filled with fresh ingredients and covered in a delicious red sauce. The California fries were even more impressive. Layer upon layer of flavor. Both together was way more than one person should be able to handle. And the sauces... The red and green were delicious with a good amount of heat but the habanero blew the roof off my skull. Not for the faint of heart (like myself), so fortunately I only sampled it. The food was great here and the service I got when ordering came with a great smile and attitude. The food was delivered to my table very fast (and there was quite a lunch time crowd here). The surroundings weren't that great (reminded me of a run down Taco Bell) but who cares... The food was incredible (well priced for what you got) and good service and those trump locale every time in my book.", "author": "Roger M."}

My burrito was amazing but they shouldn't call it a wet burrito they should call it a drowning burrito!  There was so much sauce! At first I was a little scared but the sauce was delicious. The inside of the burrito was the star. The carnitas were the best I've had. Perfectly moist and crispy.  What was great was that there was rice in the burrito but not too much! And the tortilla was so good. I don't even know how to describe it but it was perfection. My complaint of the place was the the guacamole that my bf got with his fajitas. It didn't look like guacamole. Almost like tomatillo salsa. It was that thin and liquidy. It really looked like fake guacamole that you squeeze out of a bag. \n\nThe thing I really loved is the self serve chips and salsa bar.

And with the help of yelp we found this place. \nAPPEARANCE & LOCATION: Its not the most appealing in appearance but neither is the whole lower nob hill area that this place sits. So, yeah factor that in before you rate it low for appearance. You cant expect an elegant looking restaurant in a rough neighborhood. But I'd like to mention that although it wasn't the nicest looking, it was clean. And I very much appreciated having not just a clean table but a clean environment. There was no bad odor present. \nFOOD: I ordered the (wet) Super burrito with Al pastor. I told the young lady, before ordering, that I didn't want the hot sauce (bc although I love the taste of hot sauce, I have a low tolerance for chili's my sinus will even act up. Loseri know). But the Lady said that none of their sauces were hot, so I chose the green one.  Once the order came i took one bite and yowzers it was hot (again, this is coming from a chili panzy. Taco bell hot sauce is too hot for me most the time too). I was able to exchange my green wet burrito to a red one. And it was deeeeeelicious! So was the green sauce burrito (a side note for those of you chili risk takers out there.) my husband ordered the wet chimichanga with al pastor. That was good too but not as good as my wet burrito.\nThere is also a chips and salsa bar, for free, and all you can eat. And it was pretty good!\nPRICES: chimichanga $8.25 wet super burrito $7.50. Cant complain on these prices. That's sort of unlikely these days, especially in SF. You cant even get parking for that price haha.\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: The girl that took our order was nice and even when i returned my first wet burrito to her saying that it was too hot, She was kind enough to let me try the other sauce to see if it was okay for me. The cook or owner (not sure who he was) but a man came out and helped out by taking the burrito back and making me a new one with the not so hot sauce. I was very satisfied with their customer care.\n\nA 4 star to this place for excellent customer service, prices and tasty and generous servings of food! \n\nMuey bueno to this place!", "author": "Rayonica C."}

My coworkers and I trek up Polk street once every 2 weeks to fill our bodies with carbs, grease, and a whole bunch of salsa. The 4 of us usually order 3 items and share amongst ourselves - perfect amount. \n\nQuesadillas aren't the typical large tortilla folded in half and grilled. The quesadillas here are made up of 2 small fluffy tortillas with meat and cheese in the middle and topped with the works if you order the super. We always order the regular with just meat and cheese.\n\nBurritos are huge and the wet burritos are tasty. You can choose between red and green sauce. We've never tried the green, but the red is tasty and doesn't taste like a can of spaghetti-o's. \n\nNachos are loaded with toppings and seem to not have enough chips to support the fiasco on top, but not to worry, there's a chip bar in the back. AYCE chips and salsa! They also offer California nachos (French fries instead of chips)\n\nSharing amongst ourselves, we never go over $6 each.", "author": "Cheryl Q."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-05", "description": "This review will be divided into two parts.  The first is how I ended up at El Super Burrito.  If you are not interested in my walkabout, you can skip down to the \"Restaurant Review\" section.\n\nEvery once in awhile, I want to go out for dinner.  But I lack the social energy or desire to reach out and find someone to dine with.\n\nSo, I go on a dinner walkabout.  This consists of simply picking a direction and starting to walk.\n\nThere are only three rules.\n\n1.  No doubling back.  If I decide to pass up a restaurant, that's it.   I have to go forward.\n\n2.  No research until I am committed. \n\n3.  Must eat somewhere new.\n\nIn the evenings, I will often go north.  This takes me to Chinatown and onto North Beach.  Finding a restaurant walking north is pretty much like shooting fish in a barrel with a 12 gauge shotgun.\n\nHeading south is also a pretty easy way to go.  That takes me right downtown into the Union Square area.\n\nIn the daytime, going eastward down the hill into the Fi-Di can also be fruitful.\n\nHowever, this evening, I decided to make it a real challenge.  I decided to head west on Pine.  For restaurants, this is a pretty barren stretch.\n\nRue Lepic was up first.  But I was not in the mood for French.  Plus, walkabouts are more about finding great hole in the walls.  Nob Hill Grille was next.  But, for similar reasons, this also did not strike my fancy.\n\nUp a block on California, I spotted what looked like a restaurant.  It was a bar.  I thought about popping in for a drink but decided that I would soldier on.\n\nAcross the street, there was a Thai place.  But it was pretty empty.  So,  I continued down California.  I finally made it to Polk.\n\nNow the decision was to either head north or south on Polk.  I know more about the area north.  But, I decided to head south.\n\nThere actually were quite a few restaurants.  These were Thai and Middle-Eastern.  That really wasn't what I was in the mood for.  Finally, I spotted a Mexican place.  That sounded pretty good to me.  There were quite a few people in the restaurant.  I decided that was the place for me.  And that is how I ended up at El Super Burrito.\n\nRestaurant Review\n\nFirst, I am going to start with ambiance.   I would call it \"Mexico meets McDonald's\".  Gotta love the swivel charis attached to the tables.  Pretty much all of the available seating options were a tight fit for me.   I will say the place seemed spotless.  If you like bright yellow, this could also be the place for you.\n\nLike many Mexican restaurants, you order at the counter and you either pick up the food or they bring it to your table.\n\nThe woman at the counter was very friendly.  There was a warmth to her personality.\n\nI decided on the carne asada platter.\n\nIt wasn't very long before the food came out.   The platter looked very good.   The meat was pretty tender.  The guacamole was more like an avocado cream.  I had asked for a mix of corn and flour tortillas and they obliged.  Like most asada platters, there was Mexican rice and beans.  Both of these were tasty.\n\nI piled the ingredients onto my tortillas and went to work.  I enjoyed it.  The only thing I didn't eat was the grilled green onions.  They did not look that appetizing.  But, upon reflection, I should have probably given them a try.\n\nIt was a very healthy portion.  Upon finishing, I certainly wasn't hungry.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7dyjdsv\n\nThey also have a self-serve chips and salsa bar.  At first, I didn't even notice.  But, after I had ordered, I decided to check on Yelp.  One of the reviews mentioned.  It was a nice touch and helped round out the platter. \n\nOverall, I liked the place.  The staff including the cook were very friendly.   The food was good.  The price was right.  The ambiance is a little funky but it didn't get in the way with digging into my meal.", "author": "Mark D."}

Kinda weird that they make you pay more for lettuce and tomato but whatev...\n\nThe burrito was HUGE and I am so full, but the quality was not the highest. So basically I just ate a TON a mediocre crap. Which is exactly how I feel right now. \n\nThe salsa bar was extremely boring and limited with only red and green sauce.

Hit the Yelp app and saw all kinds of Mexican places around me. El Super Burrito's name stuck out at me so I went for it. Later on I learned that El Super Burrito actually means \"The Super Burrito\" in Spanish. Crazy. \n\nSo you walk up to this place, and there's crazy homeless people and weirdo hoodlum youths hanging around the place. Some old black dude in an Orlando Magic Shaq jersey was screaming wildly and waving his arms as I was walking up. Not for the timid of heart. But I ain't never scared. \n\nSo I walk in and it feels just like any legit traditional Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to across the country (SoCal, Chicago, San Antonio, El Paso, Miami, etc.). Good start. I see the menu has lengua on it, so that seals the deal on it being authentic in my book. I ordered the \"Super Burrito\" with \"carne asada\". That's a super burrito with grilled steak, for all of you stupid gringos out there. This burrito comes with rice and beans and sour cream and guacamole and salsa. Not one ingredient overpowered any other and they all tasted awesome. Definitely super.\n\nFutbol was on TV. You may not know this, but that's what Mexicans call soccer. I liked that.\n\nOh and they have Mexican Coke in bottles.

So I had my reservations when I went to El Super Burrito (for you Gringoes, that's Spanish for \"The Super Burrito\").\n\nI had the Super Nachos with beef. I also had a bite of some Enchiladas. Granted I was a tad tipsy from Bar hopping on Polk St., I thought that both were delicious. The nachos were so tasty. The chips were greasy and freshly made, there was a copious amount of both sour cream and guacamole (though the guac was just so-so). The salsa was good too. Yeah, my mouth was a happy camper. For nachos that are just $6.50, these definitely met and exceeded my expectations for cheap greasy Mexican food. \n\nStaff was super friendly too. Oh, and they have Squirt. I love Squirt =P\n\nI'll be coming back here the next time that some good Mexican food strikes my mood (which I assure you will be soon).

Since I live in the 'hood, I have walked by it a million times but only eaten there twice. Our options were very limited and it was as good as any other place.\n\nWe started walking towards it ; it was close to closing when we finally got there. Apprehensive about the situation, I asked about their guacamole, trying to determine if it was going to satisfy the members of the group. The gentleman behind the register (owner) assured me that it was made fresh, but we were told it was more like a sauce for tacos/burritos (runny) instead of something thicker. We huddled and decided that this was fine with us and we bought a bowl of it.\nI got several containers of their salsa (good!) and a plate of their chips waiting for the guac. When it finally came to the table we dug in, setting expectations accordingly. I added some of the hot sauces to the guac to give it some more flavor, and we were happy.\n\nThe same guy came by 10 minutes later with a FRESH bowl of guacamole in his hands. He told us that he saw on the face of one of us that it wasn't satisfactory (not true) and thought that he would make real guacamole for us -- it had at least 3 avocados, tomatoes, onions, roasted peppers, etc. This was the REAL deal and tasted fantastic !!\n\nAll three of us were blown away with 1. the customer service, 2. the freshness of the guac. Really. \nI got some more chips and several other Coronas so that we could finish the new bowl of guac. At this point we were on cloud nine because of the perfect ending to a already wonderful evening out with friends.\n\nReally, we were blown away.

I have lived in the \"lower Polk Gulch\" area for over six (6) years. I have been amazed, by the transformation of this area, into a very \"hip and sleek,\" place for the twenty-someone's to come out and have a good time. I used to enjoy coming into the El Super Burrito, not any longer, it has become a negative and antagonist place for me.\n\nOn Sunday, September 15, 2013- @ approximately 8 p.m., against my better judgment, I decided to pick up a jumbo chicken burrito, chips, and a large strawberry drink. The total of the bill came out to $10.27, I had decided to tip one dollar ($1.00.) It was not money well spent for inferior and marginal service.\n\nAs I entered, El Super Burrito was filled with patrons, there were two (2) other people waiting behind me to order. The person, who took my order, was to say the least- uninviting with her customer greeting skills. They were non-existent. It appeared that her looks were almost hostile to me. I knew, I should have left El Super Burrito- immediately, but \"like a moron,\" I thought the situation would improve. It did not!\n\nI presented and used my US Bank Visa/Debit card to pay the bill. She swiped it into her machine. A receipt was presented to me to sign, I did sign it. BUT, I was given no receipt for my records; plus El Super Burrito charges an additional fifty cents ($0.50), to use a debit or credit card for a purchase. I wonder if this is an OK policy with the credit card companies which give El Super Burrito access to their systems.\n\nI was just dumped at the end of this burrito purchase experience. I received no \"thank you,' all she did was immediately look to the next customer in line. If I could have videotaped, this El Burrito experience, you could review it for yourself; and determine if my letter is an accurate description of the experience.\n\nI went to the back of El Super Burrito. There I picked up chips, salsa, and some limes to put on my burrito at home. Suddenly, another woman came out from behind the kitchen area, asking who had ordered the super chicken burrito. I politely raised my hand. As she gave it to me, I asked where my large strawberry drink was. I received a very, very quizzical look. Suddenly, the front cashier young woman was behind me, she informed me (QUITE BRUSQUELY) that my drink was located and placed on the front cashier counter.\n\nHow was I supposed to now that?! Did she have the courtesy to tell, as she took my order, this location information about the drink? No, she didn't. This end part of this El Super Burrito purchase experience put the \"nail in the coffin.\" Maybe El Super Burrito doesn't need regular return customers. I know, I will not be returning to El Super Burrito again. If I want rude, negative, inappropriate behavior, all I have to do is walk around Polk Street. I don't expect or deserve it, when I'm a respectful and courteous customer.\n\nThere food is just OK; it's not spectacular or especially noteworthy. \n\nI appreciate the time you spent reading this letter.

Not outstanding food, but since I don't eat meat, the rest of the stuff isn't hard to do.  And it's pretty cheap.  But, when they consistently give me the opposite of what I order, the rest doesn't matter.\n\nBut, the penultimate time that I went, I ordered my the nachos.  No meat - just lettuce.  Instead, I get no lettuce, and stuffed with meat.  Unfortunately, I'd gotten it to go, and only noticed after I got home.  I'm tired after a long day, and I'm not in the mood to go back, so I just spend the time picking out the meat, and vow that, next time, I'll make a big deal out of it, and check my food before I leave the restaurant.\n\nSo, next time, I forget to make a stink when I order, but when she hands my order to me, she asks, \"You just wanted lettuce and no meat?\", so I know she knew what I ordered.  But, I get back home, and it's the same effing thing!  So, I get in my car, spend 15 minutes looking for parking, find a spot 3 blocks away, get there, and she's super apologetic, and gets the guy that made it, and he redoes my order.  When he hands it to me, he says, \"It's not my fault, I just make what she tells me\".  F!U!  She repeated my order correctly when she told me.\n\nNever again.", "author": "masa s."}

This place came as a recommendation from him and I'm always up for finding good, fast, and easy to get burritos!  Being located around the corner works out perfect for me.\n\nI picked up a regular chicken burrito and a veggie burrito.  While waiting, I looked around the place. The salsa bar is intriguing, but I didn't grab any chips so I didn't try it. It's all you can eat and I saw people filling up on nachos and salsa pretty regularly.  \n\nTurnaround time for two burritos was a bit longer than I would have expected, but service was very friendly and the price what you would expect for standard burritos.  My order was packaged up in a brown bag and I headed off to my friend's place.\n\nI found the burritos to be a really good size, more than enough for a dinner.  Stuffed full of rice, veggies, meat and tasty goodness, these were pretty decent burritos and I was quite happy with it.\n\nDefinitely a place to check out if you're looking for good, inexpensive burritos and would like to avoid large chains like Chipotles (which there's nothing wrong with, I actually really like their burritos too!)", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Unfortunately it wasn't great. The positives of this place were as follows: \n\n-Very very clean, at least when I was there. I ordered to-go, but while I was waiting for my order, I noticed staff continuously cleaning the place which was great.\n\n-A small chips and salsa bar inside. It's a help-yourself kind of deal. Glad I noticed it so I could pack a nice little to-go bag of chips with some tasty salsa. I must say this was the best part of my meal. The salsa was nice and spicy, and the chips were decent.\n\nNow for the unfortunates:\n\n-Ordered the vegetarian burrito, no sour cream. The burrito was massive, pretty impressive actually. Hardly ANY guacamole or pico de gallo were in my burrito. It was pretty much all rice, beans, and cheese. I HATED the cheese they put in there too. It just didn't taste good at all. I ended up opening my burrito to eat around the cheese. Then I realized the lettuce was also extremely soggy. Basically the whole thing was just a limp, soggy mess. I threw out the rest of it, which was about 50% of it at least, and just ate the rest of my chips and salsa instead.\n\n-Today my stomach has hurt all freaking day because of it. Blah.

If you're sitting down, they give you a number to sit on your table.  I paid at the counter, added a nice tip to the tip jar on the counter, took my large No. 28 sign, sat it on my table, sat No. 28 in a prominent place and waited.  And waited, and waited.

I caught her again, this time at the counter.  The person behind the counter said to me that they had been calling out No. 28 and no one had responded.  Not true.  They then stuck my order in the microwave and finally served it to me.  It was dreadful.  It might have been o.k. when it was first made, but microwaved lettuce and sour cream gives you soggy lettuce and liquid sour cream.  As I was leaving I confronted the waitress once again and asked her to explain the delay.  This time she told me that she had called out my number, from the floor.  I asked her why that would have been necessary since there was a large sign on my table saying No. 28.  She really had no excuse.  The obvious truth was that my order got prepared and then overlooked, then the person behind the counter and the waitress both lied about trying locate me by calling out my number.

The burritos and tacos are substandard, low in taste and low in quality (the greens perpetually appear wilted and taste vaguely of chlorine bleach).

Nothing has ever been really awful but the true test (the genesis of this review if you will) came this last weekend. I brought three drunk crazy Mexican chicks from Eastside San Jose up for Pink Saturday. If there were ever three \"qualified\" judges for a taqueria, this would be them.\n\nLengua tacos, a carnitas super burrito, vegetarian tacos, plus plenty of chips and salsa were quickly delivered to our tables and consumed by all. The only thing that slowed the pace of our consumption was the occasional burly pepper that would leave a trail of burn down the throat/ out the nose. Two of the ladies found the jukebox by the salsa bar and went to town finding some banda to sing and dance with. The staff though cordial, seemed a little freaked out by our bailadoras.

Not saying the ones here are bad, just not to my liking. I have lived by El Super Burrito for 2 years and never went in because the outside of it looks so damn depressing. But today I finally went in and I am kicking myself....\n\nFirst of all, the inside is nothing at all like the outside. It is bright and there is ranchero playing on a big juke and lots of people inside. \n\nSecond of all, I got a carne asada burrito that I really liked. I agree with some yelpers that the carne was a bit dry, but I appreciated the consistency of the burrito. Granted I don't think rice belongs in a burrito, but still the whole thing was easy to eat and really delicious to me. \n\nThere are some negatives. Their hot carrots blow. The horchata is good but not great. My friend's veggie burrito was a little soggy. But who gets a veggie burrito anyway? Whatever.\n\nSo I will definitely be back there.

If you want authentic Mexican (not just burritos) then this is your spot. The decor seems to be throwing a lot of people off, with some people calling it dirty. This isn't the case, it's just run down a bit - and that adds to its charm if you ask me.", "author": "Jay F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-21", "description": "Alright, I know a lot of people are down on the El Super Burrito, but can I just say this is some of the most authentic and delicious mexcan food I've had? Granted I'm from NY and we don't have great mexican, this place is one of the first ones that I tried and it's still a favorite. The place is a little dirty, but c'mon thats where the flavor comes from! The free chips are awesome too. \n\nMy usual fare is a giant quesadilla with carne asada and a large pineapple drink. All awesome, all the time. \n\nThe fajitas are great too if you're looking to spend some extra cash on it.", "author": "John K."}

The taste makes me think no. While both El Burrito Express stores deliver consistently good burritos in places without them, this place just delivers burritos. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, I was in a desperate burrito fix and happened to drive by this place.  I entered, starving and easy to please.  From there, everything went downhill.  My order took forever even though I was the only one in there.  The burrito was bland and watery. The salsa sucked -- hell, the salsa bar was filthy and I'm no salsa bar snob.\n\nThe bathroom is downright frightening. It's up some dark stairs, not exactly where you want to go on this downtrodden part of Polk Street.", "author": "Dean A."}

Call me crazy but El Super Burrito has the best carnitas I've ever tried and the salsa is the best in town; it usually has just the right amount of fresh jalapeno. They do skimp out on the \"heat lamp\" over their chips so I knocked off a star and I haven't tired anything by the burritos and tortas but I do recommend this place.", "author": "jordan t."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-31", "description": "While some Mexican food restaurants have fancy and romantic names like El Farrolito or Taqueria Cancun, the people at El Super Burrito said, \"Fuck that!  Let's have our name tell people exactly what we do; we make big motherfucking burritos.  That's what we do!\"  It'd be like a clothing store being named Very Comfortable Cotton T-shirts (believe it or not, one of the world's biggest telescopes is actually called the Very Large Telescope.  These people can design a way to see light years away, yet can't think of anything better than Very Large Telescope.).  Despite the uncreative name though, the burritos here are good and yes, very big.  The jumbo burrito is easily big enough for two people to split and it's only $5.50.  They also have all you can eat chips and salsa.  But the decoration here takes the cake; they have so many Corona streamers and piatas hung up that you would think it was a five year old kid named Corona's birthday party.", "author": "Broke-Ass Stuart S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-22", "description": "The name is overly complimentary, but I can understand why the owner doesn't call it \"El So-So Burrito\".  I'd go back, but probably not very often, and I certainly wouldn't go out of my way.  I doubt this place would last too long in the Mission, but fortunately for the owner, there's not much burrito competition around Polk & Sutter.  The quality of steak seems a little below average, and the burritos have too much rice relative to meat.", "author": "Luke P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-08", "description": "i don't think people are really getting it. even though it is called super burrito that's just to attract gringos. this place is a taqueria and a damn fine taqueria in the Polk gulch if you ask me. i think that most people would be pleasantly surprised if they tried other things on the menu. I usually opt for the tacos al pastor, they are very tasty. This place is also frequented by a lot of Mexican clientele and since they probably know Mexican food better than you or I do that should tell you something. That being said I have never as of yet seen a Mexican patron order a burrito here. Come to think of it I very rarely see anyone other than white folks order burritos at any taqueria. I used to eat here 1-2 times a week because it was in close proximity to my old apt. now having moved to SOMA it is definitely a place that will be missed. i think it is actually one of the best taquerias outside of the mission.", "author": "Anthony Y."}
