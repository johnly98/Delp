It has been 5? 6? years since I first dined at La Folie and my second time back was just as good as I remembered.  \n\nLa Folie's menu is similar to Gary Danko in that you can chose 3, 4, or 5 courses and they are very flexible letting you mix and match and chose what you like to have.  \n\nEvery dish was excellent with the butter poached lobster, foie gras terrine, and bone marrow frog legs being more outstanding.  \n\nService was impeccable.  Everyone was attentive to our needs.  Valet is $15.  The maitre d' will ask you for your valet ticket and by the time you are finished with your meal, your car is waiting for you at the curb already. \n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "Shirley H."}

I was able to make reservations for two the same week. I had to push my reservation back an hour and called 3 hours prior the same day. Susie (sp?) was very accommodating and was able to do it without any stress.\n\nThe dining room had a cozy feeling to it, and all customers seemed to be conversating in a very relaxed setting. I didn't feel pressured to whisper to my dining partner.\n\nThe service was exceptional. Our waiter presented the menu and allowed for us to take our time browsing after offering drinks. He brought over a bowl of white truffles, allowed us to smell the aroma and explained that the chef had an off menu pasta dish we were able to order a la carte if we wished. He then explained everything on the menu and all possible substitutions. \n\nBoth of us opted for Chef Passot's tasting menu ($160 p/p)which consisted of two amuse bouche's at the beginning and end of the menu. We also went with the wine pairing for an additional $95 p/p.\n\nAll dishes were executed with perfection, from the plating to the mixture of flavor combinations. I also felt that each wine pairing went perfectly with each dish. The waiter made sure each glass we had went well with our dish. My dining partner elected to get the seared foie gras supplement (additional $30) to go with his main dish (Snake River Farms of Ribeye) and the waiter presented a different glass of cabernet to go with his dish. How thoughtful is that?\n\nThe wait staff was very attentive and explained each dish, each glass of wine with ease. I would definitely come back!", "author": "Jenny Y."}

The dining room is not very large, but had a cozy and elegant feel to it which made our time dining at this location very enjoyable. The service was fantastic and our waiter was very attentive, informative and knowledgeable about all the food on the menu. I chose to order the Chef's Tasting Menu and our waiter was able to suggest potential off-menu changes which really helped to enhance our experience even further.\n\nMy first course consisted of the Foie Gras Terrine and it was expertly prepared and absolutely delicious with the bread and jam. This was my first time trying Foie Gras prepared this way and it was a delightfully unique way to consume Foie Gras that I definitely hope to try again.\n\nFor my second course, I had the Butter Poached Lobster. This dish was incredibly tasty and decadent and was essentially an elevated version of lobster bisque. Overall, this may have been my favorite dish of the night but was slightly marred on my last bite as the chef had accidentally left the shell on the piece of lobster which I didn't notice until I had already begun chewing. That wasn't the most appetizing way to finish what was otherwise an incredibly well-executed course.\n\nMy third course was the main event, consisting of the Snake River Farms Eye of Ribeye and as suggested by our waiter, topped with a second course of Seared Foie Gras. This dish was absolutely decadent and well prepared. The steak itself was very well prepared and tender which combined with the Seared Foie Gras was truly special and incredibly flavorful and tasty. I would recommend this particular combination to anyone who is a fan of steak and foie gras.\n\nNext came the cheese course, which I was rather excited for, but sadly this was the low-point of the meal for me. While there weren't any notable flaws in the preparation, it just simply wasn't for me. This is, of course, subjective and I'm sure there are many who would enjoy this dish as it was, but I found it to be not particularly enjoyable. Particularly, the combination of Fig with edible flower and cheese was beautiful, but simply not to my taste and I actually found it difficult to even finish. Your tastes may vary from my own, so it's possible you will have a very different experience with this course, but for me, this was not nearly as enjoyable as our other courses.\n\nI ended with the \"Dark Chocolate Opera Cake\" and thankfully this was a return to a high note. The chocolate was very tasty and the cake was light and fluffy which mixed with the berries resulted in a very satisfying end to the meal. \n\nThe portions throughout the meal were just right. The five courses, in addition to the amuse bouche and surprise second round of dessert featuring some small delectables, left us very full and satisfied. The meal overall was very enjoyable and we're likely to give this restaurant another try in the future. If not for a small mistake on the 2nd course and the low point during the cheese round, this definitely would have been a 5 star experience. I will look forward to giving this restaurant another try in the future.", "author": "Ryan W."}

It had been a couple since my last visit, and I was very happy to discover that it was still as delicious as ever!\n\nWe went for my birthday, so we went all out and had the self selected 5 course and asked them to pair wines with the meal. I really like that you can choose your own courses and curate your own experience. The only thing I had forgotten was how big the portions were. Needless to say we had a delicious meal, but had to be rolled out by the end of it - not a bad problem to have on a rare occasion. \n\nIt is also nice to see that the chef continues to be present at the restaurant regularly and greets his guests.

The amuse was smoked trout with chip and creme fraiche (3/5).  This was an interesting small bite - tasty but mediocre. \n(2).  The second course was foie gras terrine with confit artichoke, chilled duck consomm\u00e9 and black truffle (4/5). This was served with a nice toasted brioche.  \n(3).  One of the chef's freeby was a very meaty Shigoku oyster (5/5). \n(4).  Butter poached lobster with carrot and spinach bisque was really great (5/5).  This is one of the chef's specialities and I really recommend it. \n(5).  The main entree was truly spectacular - Wagyu rib-eye with seared foie, porcini mushroom flan, veal sweetbreads and Madeira sauce. As a bonus, the chef added some shaved black truffles. This is one of the best singular dishes I've had (10/5). The seared foie was $30 extra but was well worth it. \n(6).  Cheese course was mediocre (3/5).\n(7).  Sorbet palate cleanser was nice (4/5). \n(8).  The dessert was very unique - espelette pepper and chocolate ganache with cherries and sorbet.  This is my first spicy dessert and I really liked it (5/5). \n(9).  Mignardises were good (4/5). \n\nOverall, this is a really spectacular meal (French food at its best).  Two of my favorite things are foie gras and black truffles and this meal had both in more than one dish.  Service was great and the meal was well-paced.  The meal is a tad expensive (including tax and tip, it's about $280) and is comparable to 1-2 Michelin starred restaurants in SF. Highly recommended!!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

What I mean by this is that the presentation was great and the dishes looked unique and imaginative. However, when I actually tasted the dishes, I felt that the execution was lacking. Despite being more creative than Gary Danko, the dishes did not taste as well prepared. Meats were not soft, dishes did not feel balanced, and favors were not complementary. Sure, I like a unique dish as much as the next person but the basics need to be there first. The dish had to taste good! For the price, I did not think La Folie delivered.

Compared to dining many times in France and other Michelin experiences, I was generally disappointed and felt it was a waste of money. \n\nThe service was 5 Stars, impeccable.\n\nHowever the food was a 3.5 as a stretch:\nThe tuna tartare was well seasoned and cooked well.\nThe risotto was soupy. Nothing like a risotto should be. The lobster was 3 bites. For this level of cuisine I understand the small portion size, which was basically sufficient for me. But my husband's rabbit was such a huge portion he couldn't finish it was awkward waiting for so long while he finished. Not well balanced in choice regarding portions.\nLastly, the baked Alaska was not well balanced in textures and taste.\nOverall, disappointed with the food.\n\nI gave them 3 stars due to the high bill. For a $110 3 course meal x2 + $40 for half bottle wine, not sure how we got to $370 with tax and tip. And maybe overcharged somehow.", "author": "Ali S."}

My friend did complain it's a little but too much cream, but I really like it. It's a very layered dish with a very good texture.  \n\nThe presentation of the Trio of Oz Farm Rabbit was awesome. It was so fun and so much flavors. You get to try so many different ways of the rabbit that even if one of them tastes just okay, you'd still very much enjoy the meal. Of course, my friend and I tasted everything. My friend also added additional shaved truffle to it. Honestly, don't taste it much. They def should be shaving much more truffles. \n\nThe Liberty Farm Duck Breast is also a must order. The skin is super crispy but the meat has so much flavor and so tender.

Restaurant policy is to charge $110 per diner at time of making reservation. If reservation is missed, the diner is mailed a La Folie gift card in the amount charged. No problem. We called on Friday night and made a Saturday night tasting course reservation. The next morning (morning of our reservation) we received a phone call asking to confirm our presence at the evenings dinner. Thought it was overkill considering the we had just agreed to the $220 charge to hold the reservation the night before. The call only raised my expectations of excellence as this approach would put them on par with other Michelin star restaurants. \n\nWe arrived and were sent to the Folie lounge next door and offered water as some part of their operation was \"backed up.\" Most establishments of this caliber would have offered wine or a cocktail. \n\nWe were escorted to our table where we took time choosing from the seasonal tasting menu or the traditional tasting menu. Again nothing was out of the ordinary or overly exciting. \n\nWe opted for the 5 course traditional tasting menu and additionally chose to start with caviar. I was surprised to see the caviar served with a glob of creme fraiche and previously frozen Maine lobster claw underneath which was chalky in texture. I have never seen caviar served this way. I have never seen such a large amount of creme fraiche served with any dish, period. \n\nThe dungeness crab tasted mostly of creme fraiche with various vegetables mixed together. The frog legs were delicious with traditional garlic butter flavor. The lobster risotto had the same frozen Maine lobster used in previous dish. The final plate, was quail and squab dish that were baked together. I have these dishes separately and anticipated the potential. It was another letdown, they weren't cooked in a way that would bring the flavors out to complement one another. The quail was chewy and gamey, not slow roasted and basking in flavor. Squab breast was dry. \n\nThe texture and taste of these dishes don't reflect traditional French cooking methods. Every meal tasted rushed, despite waiting 20-30 minutes between each plate. (Their timing for tasting course sequence seemed off-tells me they were disorganized)and each dish consisted of the same vegetables seen in previous dishes. \n\nAfter dinner treats were carted our in the usual fashion. 4 different types of truffles and each one was appallingly stale. \n\nAlso- a restaurant of this caliber should have its own ladies room.

The waiters were really friendly and the chef came to greet us at the end. Dishes were fresh, unique and beyond my expectation.\n\nHowever, the reason that I am giving 3 starts is because of one hostess. Didn't get her name but for sure she ruined the night a bit.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 booked this place to celebrate our engagement. He made 2 phone calls before we came to confirm our reservation and even arranged some nice flowers on the table.  \n\nOur reservation was 8:30. We arrived at around 8:15. The nicer hostess, Jennifer, told us that we need to wait next door at the lounge and she would seat us closer to our reservation time. Ok, no problem with that.\n\n8:30 sharp we didn't see anyone coming to get us, so we went out the lounge and back to the restaurant again. This time, it was another hostess (the horrible one) that greeted us and she told us our table was not ready yet. I was starting to get a bit annoyed, because I have never been told to wait beyond the reservation time at a fine dinning restaurant like La Folie.  (I've been to Gary Danko, Benu, Quince ... just to name a few.) Also, it was our engagement dinner. \n\nAt 8:37, we were told that our table was ready. The wait was actually not that bad. Another couple had a 8:45 reservation and only got seated at 9pm. What really got me, was that when I pointed it out that it was 7 minutes passed our reservation time, the horrible hostess replied impatiently \"7 minutes is not a long wait.\" What. A. Shock. \n\nExcuse me, if you're working at a super hip super popular brunch place, you can have all that attitude and I wouldn't say a thing. But please, you're working at a fine dining restaurant with exquisite French cuisine and tasting menus, and that's your attitude? Why don't you try working at Forever 21 or something? Truth be told, the last time I've seen such an arrogant hostess was at the True Food Kitchen, Palo Alto. \"7 minutes is not a long wait\", save it for people playing \"7 minutes in Heaven\". \n\nAnyway, I understand that restaurants get busy. When I pointed it out that we were seated late, I was not expecting a \"sorry\" but I was sure not expecting to receive such an attitude, either. \n\nMy boyfriend also got angry from that \"7 minutes is not a long wait\" hostess because she was clearly having an attitude. We spoke to both Jennifer, who kindly seated us, and the manager about how unprofessional that was. They were much more polite and understood that we got upset. In fact, the rest of the staff were all very friendly and polite. We enjoyed the rest of the night. Everything was perfect.\n\nSo, if you want to try La Folie, I would recommend it. Just beware of some attitude.", "author": "Aoni W."}

I ordered three courses and ask the chef to choose which course to add black truffle on, and at my last lamb course, I still don't see truffle. When I asked my waiter to check with the chef whether my last course is the best course to add truffle, they just came out with truffle shavings and add it directly to my lamp chop. \n\nThe taste of truffle did not blend well with the lamb chop at all, it would haven been much better with my 2nd course, scallop.

It is undeniably tasty and the size of this thick, delectable treat is substantial compared to other pieces of foie gras I've encountered ($30.00 supplement). \n\nThis restaurant is a prime choice for modern French fare. Refined flavors and presentation were commendable. Our only peeve was the staff's ill timing on bringing out each of the dishes--service was just peculiarly slow. We were essentially left hanging for an unusually long period of time, longing for more, wondering when the next dish would come out. It took approximately 3 hours to complete a four course meal. \n\nPortions are considerably generous, so when the server warns you about the four course meal being hefty, he's not joking. Frankly, we were stuffed by our third course. We ended up taking home a portion of our fourth courses. Us...weak sauce? Nah, not even! \n\nP.S.

We were early for our reservation but no problem, we hung out at the La Folie Lounge next door. I love their specialty cocktails especially the Le Brie. Once the table was ready we were collected and taken to the restaurant. I requested a nice table for our special occasion and they did not disappoint. We both chose the 5 course dinner. Everything was done to perfection. My husband danced around the seafood section but still managed to enjoy his delicious lobster risotto as well as his lamb rack. He also enjoyed the desert which is both cheese and sweet. A mini Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9 plated together with a ginger cake a la mode. The asparagus soup was amazing. My favorite dish was the Dungeness crab warm salad. They have a reasonable priced valet option for your convenience.\n\nAt the end of the meal Chef Roland Passot stopped by our table for a visit and to congratulate us for our anniversary.

Mushroom duck egg raviolo with shaved truffle (special)\n2. Lobster and mushroom risotto\n3. Snake River Farms ribeye\n4. Huckleberry Baked Alaska\n\n1. Hudson Valley foie gras\n2. Butter poached lobster\n3. Frog leg and snail ragout\n4. Miyazaki A5 wagyu\n\nThe mushroom duck egg raviolo with shaved truffle was very creamy and had mild earthy notes from the trumpet mushrooms and shaved truffle. The raviolo texture was very sticky and chewy.\n\nThe Hudson Valley foie gras was buttery smooth and delicious, and served at a very generous 5 oz portion size! Caramelized apple on the bottom added sweetness. There was no complementing carb in this dish to balance the richness, so ask for more bread to absorb all the remaining flavors at the bottom of the dish.\n\nLobster mushroom risotto had very large, meaty lobster pieces mixed into a very creamy risotto. Risotto is a rich dish, and this one here was no exception.\n\nNever tasting frog legs or snails before, the frog leg and snail ragout in bone marrow was a risky dish. Frog legs were tender, mild tasting and the snails were also tender, but not slimy as I was expecting.\n\nBoth Snake River Farms ribeye and Miyazaki A5 wagyu were delicious and juicy, but the wagyu was noticeably tastier with its melt in your mouth, velvety tenderness. The potato pave with beef tongue had a nice crispy crust, and the generous piece of chicharron was light and airy, but too salty.\n\nFinally, the Huckleberry Baked Alaska was divine with a balance of flavors from the sweet huckleberry and tart lemon sherbet. This was an excellent dessert overall, and served at a sensible portion too!\n\nBesides the so-so decor, my only other disappointment was the rock-hard butter for the bread. But overall the menu had a great extensive selection of meat, seafood, and vegetarian options to choose from. \n\nI suggest arriving in the area 10-15 minutes before your reservation to hunt for parking. It took us 10 minutes to round a 3-block radius to finally locate a spot at Union and Polk Streets. Otherwise, settle for the $15 valet provided by the restaurant or ride-share.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

It was not very crowded at all and made for a very nice dining experience. Nice starter cocktails and the sommelier on staff helped us make a very nice selection of wine for the table that represented what I was looking for. Each of us ordered either 3 or 4 dish courses and were very full at the end of the meal.\n\nFood was amazing. We started with just a half ounce of caviar and it was a nice treat to start the meal. The starter was a flavorful salmon croquette. Seared fois gras, even with the additional cost, was definitely a good choice and amazing. I can see why it is a chef's specialty. Frog legs were good, although not quite sure where the bone marrow was. The pig feet and sweetbread were interesting, and probably not something often ordered, but I liked it. Their small oyster shooter in the middle of the meal was a nice surprise. Their rabbit is very intricately plated and very tender, I would recommend. The duck breast was not the best I had but it was still really good. The lamb chops were excellent and well proportioned. There was a simple melon sorbet as a palate cleanser towards the end for dessert. I got the blackberry mousse on the current chef's tasting menu, which as the waitress explained, was their take on a peanut butter and jelly, and thought it was a nice end to the meal. The petit fours at the very end were ok, not amazing, but the table really enjoyed the passion fruit caramels.\n\nEven though the food and drinks were very good, I thought the service was not the best I've seen. While there was nothing wrong, there were a few execution elements to the service that I would have expected a little more with the type of restaurant that La Folie represents. Overall, good dining experience and very glad I decided to come here for once.", "author": "V W."}

We are not quite so fond of chef de cuisine Joe Ball; he lacks the precise touch and elegant restraint of owner/execchef Roland Passot. However, my niece picked all winners for her meal so she was wowed, saying this was even better than our recent group dinner at Auberge du Soleil/Rutherford. Her Kanpachi, Crab Bisque Royale, Lamb, and the incomparable Edam souffle, were all on-point and flawless.\n\nSpouse and I experienced some misses. We don't care for the foie gras with apples; which we've now had twice. The apple consomme just lacks the spark that 2013's spiced peach consomme foie gras dish had. But La Folie is always generous with the foie and handles it beautifully. \n\nAsparagus soup was good but lacked depth and interest. Butter poached lobster was surprisingly chewy for a sous-vided 'chicken' lobster, but the orange maltaise is a brilliant combination with it. The frog leg and snail ragout was well-executed but not particularly exciting; it's not a memorable combination.\n\nThe crusted venison with red cabbage choucroute was a BIG miss. The venison had so much dry rub it tasted dusty rather than tasty. There were just too many elements on the plate, and most of them didn't play well with one another. Salty cabbage, salty berry sauce, and salty orange curd, along with parsnips and brussels sprouts and salsify, ended up fighting one another and overwhelming the venison. I was very disappointed in this dish; I love venison but this was just a mess.\n\nThe lobster risotto was the third time Spouse has ordered it, and will be the last. The first time was exquisite. The second time it had unannounced creme fraiche in it, which Spouse loathes with a passion. This time? It was full of little rounds of half-raw asparagus, tossed in at the last minute but not allowed to cook long enough. Crunchy and grassy, they were completely inappropos. Spouse complained he had a hard time even FINDING any rice. Cross this one off your list until the kitchen learns how to handle a risotto better.\n\nThe apple tatin and the baked Alaska were vastly inferior to the souffle. Stick with the latter for the best ending to your meal. The mignardises have not changed much over the years, save for the elimination of the only good one, the exquisite chocolate marquise. \n\nService, as always, is Perfection itself under Mme. Passot; would that she teach these skills to other would-be 5-star places! \n\nWe are still fond of La Folie, but it's no longer our first choice for fine dining. A little more discipline and experience will hopefully cure the kitchen of those unnecessary flourishes and irritating unbalanced flavors.", "author": "Jean K."}

The butter was also too hard for a Michelin-starred restaurant.\n\nSeared foie gras: this is the must-get item on the menu. Comes in quite a large portion for foie gras.  It was juicy and served over a cooked-pear so it had a sweet taste along with it. Note: it's duck foie gras not goose foie gras. But still great tasting nonetheless. fyi- ordering this item is an extra $30.\n\nSlow-cooked salmon: was good, but nothing you couldn't get at any normal restaurant.\n\nFrog legs with bone-marrow: the frog leg meat itself is not that special however it was loaded with great-tasting bone-marrow sauce. It came with mushrooms too.\n\nLobster: it was really good. The pasta was sweet and had a slice of truffle on it.\n\nDuck breast: cooked medium-rare, did not melt in your mouth, would not recommend ordering.\n\nLamb rack: quite a bit of fat, nothing special.\n\nEdam Cheese Souffl\u00e9: the must-get dessert item. It is made with a semi-hard cheese (edam) & eggs and yet manages to be sweet at the same time.\n\nMy experience is obviously not indicative of everyone else's future experience. Some people love this place, others not so much. I would actually give this place 3.5 stars but that is not possible with Yelp's current rating system.

He had planned for us to spend a random Sunday near the pier with the intent to have dinner somewhere. As usual, I started spouting guesses, and per usual, I failed to guess the restaurant he picked. See, he's pretty good at surprises.\n\nLa Folie presents their diners with various options. The first is their $150 tasting menu comprised of 5 dishes. Then there's the mix & match option priced based on the number of entrees. I opted for the $100 3-course menu, and my boyfriend went for the $140 5-course menu. Our waiter allowed us to substitute some of the a la carte items with dishes from the tasting menu except for the ribeye.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't take a picture of our March 2016 menu, so I don't have the full item descriptions. But it looks like some dining items are frequent flyers with various ingredients switched up, and pictures speak louder than words, right? ;)\n\nThroughout the meal, we were given three amuse bouche (two of which were seafood-based), a plate of 4 petit fours, and a lemon ice cream palate cleanser. As for our mains, my boyfriend and I ordered:\n\n-Goat cheese tatin: creamy! Not a favorite because I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.\n-Lobster and mushroom risotto: cooked well and presented with a cute leaf and stem, but it is a petite portion. The pieces of lobster meat are pretty dang big.\n-Liberty Farms duck breast: divine. Medium-rare and juicy meat surrounded by crispy skin.\n-Butter-poached lobster: absolutely lovely. Juicy and generous.\n-Wood-grilled yellowtail: delicious.\n-Roasted Emigh Farms lamb rack: get this. Two large portion of medium-rare lamb ribs seasoned with au jus.\n-Grilled octopus: fairly huge tentacle piece! You can really savor the char from the grilling, which is a nice juxtaposition to the chewiness of the octopus. Not my favorite, but fun to eat.\n\nFavorites? The duck breast, lobster, and lamb rack.

La Folie's first ever Rising Stars pop up event was truly one of the most tantalizing meals I've ever had. You could taste the heart and soul of each dish, each bite...down to each ingredient. The chefs spent 3 months creating and refining the menu..which was more inspired by the imagination of each chef than the style of La Folie.\n\nThis was the first of a series of \"Rising Star\" events they plan to do this year. The next one is in September! The idea is to showcase the talented chefs running the kitchen and give them an opportunity to create dishes that reflect their own style of cooking. I was told many star chefs have left La Folie to start their own successful kitchens in the city.\n\nThe Rising Stars of this event were:\nChef de Cusine, Jeremy Wayne\nChef de Partie, Greg Lucero\nPastry Chef, Ashley Wentling\nBaker, Jehnifer Hoglund\n\nThe chefs came out to describe their dishes and to answer questions from the diners about the flavors, composition, and ingredients - making the experience very intimate and interactive.\n\nAt $80 per person (not including tax and tip), it's almost half the price of the prix fixe menu on  normal restaurant night.

While I initially planned on doing the tasting menu, we eventually decided on a 3 and 4 course dinner (mixed and matched from both menus) with a bottle of ros\u00e9 champagne to share. Courses were as follows:\n\nAmuse-bouche of panna cotta, sunflower seeds, and micro greens. Loved the mild creaminess of the panna cotton paired with the earthy and nutty flavors of the sunflower. It was also very pretty.\n\nFirst courses were crab salad in a crisp potato shell & fennel broth and seared foie gras with huckleberries. The crab salad with light and refreshing but not a must have. The foie gras, on the other hand, was recommended to us by our server as one of their specialties and was absolutely delicious. \n\nSecond courses out were mushroom risotto and poached butter lobster in pumpkin bisque (taken from the tasting menu). Again, both were great, but if I had to choose one it would have to be the lobster. It almost melted in the mouth and I loved the creaminess of the bisque as well.\n\nA small lemon mousse was presented as a palette cleanser. Very tasty.\n\nThird came rack of lamb (perfectly medium-rare and a generous portion) with cubes of lamb bacon, spiced pear, and charred kale. My husband was served the quail and squab roti. Equally delicious and presented beautifully with an assortment of root vegetables. This also included a small toast with foie gras mousse and shaved truffle which was a lovely touch. \n\nFinally, a cappuccino to share and the chocolate ganache with raspberry sorbet for dessert. I loved the ganache, which was rich but not overly sweet, and the raspberry gave the perfect kick of tartness. I did find it a little difficult to taste the pistachio and hazelnut flavors, however. The pastry chef also came out to wish us a happy anniversary and presented us with an assortment of petit fours at the end of the meal. \n\nI would describe the atmosphere of La Folie as relaxed elegance. The service is also great here - attentive without being fussy, which was very much appreciated. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely come back again.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was a near perfect experience.\n\nThe food is soooo good. I ordered the five course chefs tasting meal and it was way too much food. By the third course I was filled so next time I'll probably stick to a 3 course meal instead. The only parts I disliked was the cheese course (learned this isnt my kind of thing) and that the baked Alaskan had a really strong ginger sauce between the cookie and sherbet which was a bit of a turn off. Everything else was perfect! Rib eye, ahi tuna (my fav) and lobster courses were cooked to perfection. I especially loved the complimentary petit fours! I loved that each one was a distinctive flavor (caramel vs salty vs fruity vs custardish). It was a great way to end the meal.\n\nOur server was super nice, patient, and friendly. He seemed genuinely happy to guide us through our eating experience. He explained how the menu worked and gave recommendations on what to order. Other wait staff was amazing also folding napkins when we left the table, refilling water, and even helping us into our coats as we left.\n\nThe five course chefs tasting menu is priced at $150 versus the three course which was $100.\n\nWe used lyft to get there so we didn't have to deal with parking.

The food was amazing but I was just a little shocked to have gotten a $400 bill for two people. \n\nMy boyfriend and I celebrated our 8 year anniversary and we love fancy French food. We can't have it all the time so it was nice to splurge but we were on a budget and didn't realize we'd spend $400 on dinner. It was worth it but I'm still shocked that I had such an expensive dinner. \n\nWe came on a Wednesday night and it was very quiet. It took us a good 15 minutes to find parking unfortunately. We finally found a spot about three blocks away but I think we were just very lucky. \n\nTold the waiter we had a reservation and was seated right away. Our waiter was so attentive and so nice, I'm sorry I don't remember his name right now. He asked if we've been here before and we said no. He walked us through the whole menu and it was very detailed. I already had an idea of what I wanted since I took a peek at the menu beforehand. \n\nI decided to do four course because I wanted to try their dessert. My boyfriend did the three course and we both ordered the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. MAN WAS THAT AMAZING. It was such a huge piece of foie gras but I'm disappointed I have to add an additional $30 to pick that dish. \n\nI also chose Frog Legs and Snail Ragout. If you enjoy crispy frog legs, and escargot, YES this is the dish for you. It came with a sauce that was very creamy and garlicky. One bite had so many different flavors and textures going on. My boyfriend got the Risotto and It thought it was too saucy and not even enough risotto. The mushroom flavor was strong which I like but maybe not others.\nMy third course I chose the Liberty Farm Duck Breast. It was such a perfect portion of duck breast. I was so full by the end of this course. This dish was also a perfect balance of sweet and salty. The duck breast can be heavy after such a huge meal but the figs help balance it out. \nMy boyfriend's third course was the Roti of Quail and Squab. OH MY. He made me regret getting the duck breast. I know my waiter had actually recommended this entree but I love duck breast and I already mentally chose it in my mind. But the Quail and squab dish was full of flavors as well. I only took a couple bites but it was still so good! The plate had so many different textures too with crispy potato skins and mini carrots & turnips. I loved the mushroom flavor inside the stuffed quail and squab. \n\nLast, I got my souffle and even though my boyfriend didn't think it was worth it, I thought it was great! A little sweetness for the end of my meal to complete my dinner.\n\nIt was an amazing experience but I will wait until I have a better job to come back. I can't afford it with my current job. Thank you, Chef for a great dinner!", "author": "Joey C."}

For everyone else, what else is there to say about this San Francisco staple that hasn't already been said a thousand times by critics, bloggers, Yelpers, and people-who-eat-food worldwide. It's the best classically French food in the city. That's not to say it's old school or outdated either, Chef Roland Pissot has kept up with evolving food trends but only distilled the best pieces that fit with his classical French cooking. Every dish is familiar yet at the same time I feel like I'm trying something new. The portions are generous, which is sometimes sorely lacking in other Bay Area fine dining institutions (ahem Commis). Our party of 2 had the 4 course meal and left beyond full. Two people of average appetites could easily get away with the 3 course meal and still be completely satisfied.\n\nThe pricing is a tad on the steep end but it's not extraordinary for San Francisco. Couple of tips: take the 8:15pm seating if possible, Chef Pissot likes to make the rounds after all the cooking is done and you're very likely to meet him and exchange a few words. If you change your reservation within 24 hours of your original time, you will be charged 200 dollars which goes towards your meal when you do come in.", "author": "Mat K."}

I just returned from a trip to Japan so ordering the Wagyu was a mistake since it could not meet the standard of my recent meals in Tokyo.

Husband and I were warmly greeted at the entrance and seated right away (reservation). It was welcoming and nice. We ordered 4 courses meal with a bottle of wine that was recommended to us, which was very delicious! \n1) Frog leg & snail: The presentation was interesting, snails (escargot) were burie under the frog legs and all were being held in a half bone marrow. This by far is one of the best appetizers, better yet, frog legs I've ever had! It was slightly battered and very well marinated. \n2) Crispy Octopus: when I saw this on the menu, I imagined it to be crispy as in calamari crispy. However, it came out slightly crispy in a different GOOD way. We really liked this dish as well, but I liked the frog leg more. Octopus is more fulfilling because the portion was bigger.\n3) Lobster Risotto: This dish has rice, lobster meat, and mushroom. It had a hint of salt in it, I thought it was okay. I might have expected something more because I really liked the one I had from a different restaurant.\n4) Lobster tail: another dish that my husband ordered for his course, on the other hand, ad actually stolen our attention away from the risotto. Lobster meat was extrmemely fresh (couldn't get any more fresh than that!) paired with some corn & veggies... and the 3 \"ravioli\" (not sure what it was) were the best! As I took a bite, it bursted something sweet (creamy soup-like) in my mouth and it was heaven! Speechless.\n5) Duck Breast: Now this dish was beautifully presented to me with some turnips, strawberries, and what I believe was brown rice. I could taste the fresh meat of duck breast with no fat and a thin piece of crispy skin, while being paired with some sweetness from the thin slices of strawberries and slightly salty brown rice. This dish may sound overwhelming but I swear it was just the right amount, with the right amount of flavors in each bite you take. Way to go Chef!\n6) Snake ribeye: Husband had this steak dish and it was in between filet mignon soft and crispy taste. Very interesting and well tasted! \n7) Lastly, Souffl\u00e9 for dessert! It was paired with some icecream/icee, sooo good! I was hoping they'd have fruity Souffl\u00e9s but this was cream cheese I believe. The cup they used to make this souffl\u00e9 was so cute! Reminds me of the capuccino cup that Europe offers.\n\nI am giving 5 stars because of their professional and welcoming staff. Your satisfaction is clearly their priority. They are quick to take away your dishes when finished and replace new silverwares. I love their complimentary round crab bite for the day as well as a small cantalope icee that was given to us after our main courses were consumed because they wanted our taste buds to be \"cleansed\" before dessert, brilliant! I've never been to a place that offers this before. I'd also like to give props to the person that recommended us the red wine, we enjoyed it so much!", "author": "Lynn T."}

I've only had drinks at the La Folie lounge next door (drinks are delicious) so I was excited to finally try the restaurant. It did NOT disappoint. \n\nFood is amazing, service is impeccable. Although it was French and the atmosphere has a certain air to it, everyone was so friendly and welcoming. Our server was very patient with us and seemed to appreciate our humor. And it was lovely of Chef Passot himself to come to our table to greet us (maybe because we both opted for five courses and upgraded to having wagyu beef, which was TO DIE FOR). Everything was paced nicely. We didn't feel rushed; in fact, it seemed like they wanted us to stay for a while!\n\nEach plate was a masterpiece both in taste and in presentation. So if you're into taking pictures and posting them on social media, La Folie won't disappoint on that end.\n\nAs mentioned, all ten of our items were incredible but the standouts were the frog legs and ragout, the tempura duck egg, the lobster and mushroom risotto and the mushroom and leek salad (in addition to the wagyu beef).\n\nThe only criticism I would make is their separate request to tip the kitchen staff.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-19", "description": "La Folie is undoubtedly one of the most upscale restaurants I've dined at. When the hostess warmly greeted us to a grandiose interior, I knew my time here was going to be expensive! We were seated in a room with tall ceilings and wall mirrors, and our affable server explained to us how things work here. We decided to go with the Chef's summer tasting menu ($150) and one three-course dinner ($95). We were given the same amuse bouche dishes, generously scattered throughout our meal and I loved every one of them!\n\nThe first dish out of the tasting menu was the hamachi crudo - served with avocado, a lemon mousse, grilled plums, and decorated with edible flowers. I love everything about crudo and this one blew my mind! The presentation was excellent and the yellowtail tasted fresh and amazing. Great way to start the meal.\n\nButter poached lobster - the lobster was juicy and had a perfect consistency - it was too bad the piece of meat was so tiny! It was wrapped in Daikon radish and topped with caviar and lemongrass butter sauce. Too good.\n\nSnake River Farms Eye of Ribeye in a truffled madeira sauce - came with mashed potatoes and spring onions dipped in a sweet and sour sauce. The steak was incredibly tender and delectable. It didn't stand out among all of the innovative dishes but I still enjoyed it. Again, the presentation of everything was TOP NOTCH.\n\nPennyroyal Farms \"Boont Corners Reserve\" Tomme - the cheese was made from goat's milk, which I could only eat a pinch of (this is a personal preference), but from the pinch that I consumed, the texture was waxy and quality seemed high. It came with a microgreen salad, toasted walnuts and fresh figs, all placed on top of a board that seemed to be made from a slice of a tree trunk. A yummy combination of ingredients!\n\nSummer Berry Parfait - came with lady fingers, nasturtium ice cream, and herb granita which I've never tried before but had a crystalline texture and a refreshing aftertaste. \n\nFor the three-course dinner we got the foie gras that was embellished with caramelized peaches and spiced peach consomm\u00e9. The foie gras was rich and buttery as it should be. The peaches were a great addition but extremely sweet, it almost tasted like a dessert in and of itself. Worth it for the first two bites but after that I was good.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Burgundy Snails, tossed in lemon butter, parsley, bone marrow gratin - I'm not going to deny that I freaked out about the snails being stuffed inside a veal bone and was reluctant to even touching this one. I'm not a huge supporter of veal consumption, but frankly the marrow added a savory flavor to the snails; they were delicious!\n\nTrio of Devil's Gulch Ranch Rabbit, chanterelle mushrooms, summer vegetables - this one looked so pretty with all the various colors coming from both the meat and the veggies! The rabbit was presented in three different ways and a variety of summer vegetables displayed on the edge of the plate. The only other time I tried rabbit meat was in sausage form at Wurstkuche, so I thought this dish would be a nice way to explore other rabbit recipes. Although this one was creative and impressive, I don't think rabbit is something I see myself enjoying on the daily.\n\nService was perfect. Our server patiently explained every one of our dish with great detail - and there were a LOT of them - and frequently asked us if we needed anything. Towards the end of our meal, Chef Roland Passot himself came out to greet us! We really appreciated the hospitality and attention we were given by the staff.\n\nOverall, this experience was a rare one, as my student budget restricts me from frequenting these $$$$ establishments.

If he would have at least checked in and apologized for the wait I would be a bit more understanding. Now, the food was decent at best.

My only complaint was the bread and butter, as they were both hard. I expect soft bread and butter for what we are paying.\n\nMy main problem with La Folie was the hustling they did. Every waiter came around with a truffle dish and asked if we would like shaved truffles for more $$$$. Then we had Christmas Carolers come sing in the middle of dinner. I thought it was a nice touch, until they started going around each table asking for $$. \n\nIt broke the ambience immediately. Some people, like myself, go to fine dining restaurants as a nice treat to myself and my SO. We don't spend money like this on food on a regular basis. When I go to these places I'm on my best behavior, and I expect the same from the restaurant. Unfortunately, that didn't happen during my visit. \n\nAlso the old woman greeter looked at us initially very rudely. When we left, she was all smiles though. Work on your attitude before the guests see your face, perhaps?\n\nFood: Amazing.\nService: Very Poor. It's not the waiters, but the management's fault.\nAmbience: Great when you aren't being hustled for every last dollar!", "author": "Sarah O."}

There was a handful of celebrations happening the night we were there, which was surprising to me since it was a Wednesday. Intimate, cozy, and great service overall.   \n\nThe menu was simple and easy to navigate.  You could choose your courses from both, Chef Roland Passot's Spring Tasting Menu or Dinner menu, which was a plus for me.   The sommelier was approachable and helpful.  He answered our questions and gave us a bit of history lesson for which I was grateful.  His recommendation on a Left Bank wine was spot on.  I don't expect you could go wrong with any of the wine selection.  Every dish was not only beautiful but filled with layers of flavors and complexity.  Best Amuse Bouche I've ever had. \n\nWe had four courses each, paired with a bottle of Chateau St. Ahon.  Since we always share our meals it turned out to be about 12 all in all!  Felt truly indulged. \n\nTriple-T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg:  the peas and corn lends a nice sweetness and freshness.  Mixed all together with truffle vinaigrette gives a nice balance of texture, acidity, and creaminess\n\nPig Feet, Sweetbread, and Lobster Terrine: to be honest was a little awkward only because I have never imagined lobster with pork.  I thought surf and turf-ish?  I like the sweetness of the lobster to stand all on its own. Pork was definitely the star of this dish.  A friend was put off because of \"pig feet\" but that didn't bother me.  Although not my favorite dish of the night but definitely filling.   \n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: I've never had anything like it! Great with the spiced peach consomm\u00e9\n\nWarm Dungeness Crab on Bisque Royale, English Peas, Seaweed \"Chicharr\u00f3n\" probably was one of my favorite.  Light and delicious! Love the flowers. \n\nTrio of Devil's Gulch Ranch Rabbit: beautiful presentation.  Like the different ways meat was presented and the tiny perfectly cooked spring veggies\n\nEmigh Farm Lamb Rack: myer lemon puree was a nice touch and lamb was nicely cooked\n\nPeach Melba Baked Alaska: refreshing with the fresh raspberries, honey lavender ice cream and raspberry coulis\n\nSpecial dessert for the night: smoked chocolate, chocolate paper, white chocolate pearls\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in up to the moment we were out their door the staff was pleasant, kind, and accommodating.", "author": "Naty D."}

I was ecstatic!  We did valet parking since it was raining and parking was scarce in the area.  Waited at the lounge next door before our table was ready next door.  The service was great as we found a hair in the soup my BF ordered and they were apologetic and replaced with something else.  The food itself was good, but I was underwhelmed after much anticipation.  \n\nWe did wait at least 30 minutes before our first course came out after ordering and there was 30 to 40 mins between courses after we finished them, which made the whole dinner 3 hours. The long wait in between made us tired and by the end we just wanted to get out of there!  The restaurant was only partially filled and we didn't understand why there is such a delay.  When you are paying $$$$ for a meal and special occasion, you do have higher (but still reasonable) expectations.  Gary Danko and French Laundry are excellent at the timing for their courses, maybe La Folie can learn a thing or two from them.", "author": "Yue L."}

Personally, I probably would have been content with 3 but there were too many options to choose from! I decided on the burgundy snails, local cod, roti of squab and quail, and got a dessert from the Truffle Tasting menu which was called \"the truffle.\" V got the crab salad, lobster risotto, scallop, and the lamb.\n\nThe 2 amuse bouches we got were a citrus mackerel bite and the cauliflower and egg yolk soup in an egg shell. I was looking forward to the smoked salmon lollipops, but unfortunately we didn't get it =( there was a table that came later than us that did get it, so I'm not sure how they determine who gets what. But regardless, these 2 bites were delicious!\n\nMy favorite of the 4 courses I got was the snails. MUST GET.  So delectable and so much flavor. My least favorite was the roti. While it was gamey, which is to be expected, I didn't feel that the flavors went well together. V thought it was disgusting and tasted old (even though we've both had quail and squab). While I didn't find it appalling, it was just okay. V's favorite was the scallop, but he thoroughly enjoyed all 4. Overall, he enjoyed the entire dinner besides the roti.\n\nPortions were generous, so come hungry!\n\nService was attentive, as expected. \n\nGreat place for a special occasion or date night!", "author": "Noelle H."}

And considering I cannot remember anything but the delicious food and wine pairings I had that night, I would say it worked.\n\nI had an absolutely stellar experience at La Folie. I have been to many amazing restaurants, and I always tend to be a little skeptical with taster menus like this, but I have to say, La Folie delivered beyond my wildest imagination.\n\nAmbiance: La Folie, like most restaurants in SF tend to be a little more casual. I was hoping it would be more upscale and classy, but hey, we are in SF. Everyone was really dressed down. I was glad that we came a little earlier in the evening when there was a smaller crowd because as the night progressed, it definitely got a little louder, and you could overhear the nearby conversations.Three stars.\n\nService: Excellent. We had a fantastic waitress who seemed to magically appear whenever we needed her, but never seemed to linger when we didn't. She also listened and offered amazing wine pairings according to my taste. I am still dreaming of the amazing wines I had that night with my meal. Really, really lovely, she absolutely made my night. Twenty stars. The food arrived promptly after we ordered and the dishes were cleared once we were done. All the waiters were extremely knowledgeable, polite and lovely. They truly made the night and food even more spectacular.\n\nFood: Where do I begin? My friend and I had the three course menu and the dishes were truly, truly superb.\n\n1. Tasting of Passot Roe - absolute gem, I was licking the plate when people weren't looking. Superb balance of flavors, very interesting textures, but most importantly, hands down amazingly fresh and super delicious. \n\n2. Seared Dayboat Scallops - succulent and large scallops, really lovely flavor. I have to say though I couldn't really taste the uni which was a shame.\n\n3. Pan Seared Black Cod - Absolute stand out dish - the skin was fried to crisp perfection while the insides were tender and melt-in-your-mouth buttery. This was so good. I have no words to describe how good it was, it was definitely a life changing dish.\n\n4. Duck Breast - I was super full by the time this dish came out, and so I probably didn't enjoy it that much. Duck was excellently cooked, but I wasn't too fond of the seasoning - it was a litle sweet.\n\n5. Baked Alaska \nDelicious and beautifully presented. \n\nAll in all I had a wonderful experience at La Folie, the service, food and wines were simply amazing and I can't wait to come back again.", "author": "Sarah T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-05", "description": "18TH MICHELIN STAR EXPERIENCE - THE RESTAURANT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE\n\nThe first time I watched Anthony Bourdain wasn't on Travel Channel but on Food Network when he hosted the show \"A Cook's Tour\". In one of the episodes he ate at the French Laundry. One of his friends who had dinner with him Michael Ruhlman stated that eating at the French Laundry changed his life. I know that statement sound as a hyperbole. Eating dinner at restaurant that changed your life? Well I encountered that when I ate at La Folie about 3 years ago. The first time I heard of La Folie was through San Francisco episode of Anthony Bourdain's show \"The Layover\" on Travel Channel. About a month after the original airing of that episode I ate dinner at La Folie. This was the first time I ate at a Michelin Star restaurant. I didn't know what to expect. I ordered a 4-course meal. Each dish was flavorful, but what surprised me was that the portions of each dish were generous; the prime example was the seared foie gras on caramelized peach. The size of the foie gras was the size of my fist.  In addition there were free amuse-bouche dishes and toasty, warm, mini French baguettes that made me satisfyingly stuffed. I was blown away with my experience at La Folie. The significance of having my first Michelin Star restaurant at La Folie was influential because if I had a terrible experience I would never have gone to other Michelin Star restaurants. La Folie is the standard bearer for me at the moment when I eat at other Michelin Star restaurants.\n\nAbout two months later I ate at La Folie during the last week leading up to the foie gras ban. I had a 3-course meal from the foie gras tasting menu. Again I had a memorable experience. Due to the foie gras ban I never thought I would eat foie gras again. On my updated review I stated that if foie gras was ever legal again I would have my first foie gras meal at La Folie. Since the foie gras ban was lifted earlier in the year I've eaten foie gras at other restaurants prior to La Folie. I knew I would come back to La Folie to complete the full circle of the foie gras lifted ban. \n\nI ate here Thursday night. With my $50 OpenTable rewards certificate I ordered a 5-course meal. Since the menu is seasonal one item I wanted to order but was not on the menu was the burgundy snails in veal bone marrow. There were 3 amuse-bouches that were part of this meal. From my experience of eating at La Folie I had to pace myself because of that great, addicting, mini French baguette. The bread at La Folie is the best I ever had at any restaurant. Constantly eating the bread will make you full before you finish you meal. Since I couldn't order the burgundy snails for the first course was the seared day scallops with Japanese uni. The richness of the uni made this dish creamy. The second course was pig feet with sweetbread with lobster terrine. Even though this dish is listed as a started the portion of the dish could be a main dish. The combination of the pig feet and sweetbread was delectable especially with the bacon wrapped around. The third dish was the seared foie gras with caramelized peach. This dish brought back memories from the first time I ate at La Folie. The experience of eating this dish I can describe is eating grilled fruit with melted butter. I love wine but I don't like to do wine pairing with each dish as it can be costly. This was the only dish I paired with a glass of wine - sauternes a dessert wine that goes great with foie gras. The fourth dish was Liberty Farm duck breast. Every time I order foie gras I make a point to order a duck dish to prove a point that duck isn't discarded after its fatty liver is removed. The duck at La Folie isn't fatty or greasy as Peking duck but meatier. The fifth course is Peach Melba Baked Alaska. There couldn't be a more quintessential French dessert than Peach Melba, which was created by Auguste Escoffier in 1892. I've had Peach Melba at Chef Roland Passot's restaurant Left Bank Brasserie, but it did not include the Baked Alaska. So eating this Peach Melba at his flagship restaurant La Folie was a treat. What made this dessert special was the honey ice cream inside the Baked Alaska. This is the best French dessert I ever had. \n\nAs with my first two times eating at La Folie I rated my dinner as five stars. Even though it's a one Michelin Star restaurant I believe it should garner a second Michelin star. I do plan to come to La Folie again in the future. Hopefully I'll order some of its signature dishes such as the burgundy snails and the roti of quail and squab provided they're on the menu. There's a saying you throw one stone to kill two birds. Well that applies to La Folie. If you want to lose your Michelin Star and foie gras \"virginity\" I highly recommend eating at La Folie. How often is it that you can lose your virginity twice? Who knows maybe eating the seared foie gras at La Folie may be better than when you actually lost your virginity.", "author": "Gerald R."}

The environs reek of high class and neither the kitchen nor the waitstaff let each other down. I was a bit stunned that Michelin did not rate La Folie a two star award as they certainly deserve it.\n\nThey offer a 3, 4 or 5 course menu for $85, $95 and $105 respectively and considering the quality of the offerings, that is a reasonable amount to charge. The Cured Salmon and Uni Salad consisting of Cauliflower Tartare, Grapefruit, Avocado, Chilled Salmon Consomm\u00e9 was absolute perfect. The Uni was like a Salt Water ice cream and unquestionably fresh. \n\nFor an appetizer we decided upon the \"Tasting of Passot Roe,\" which was a three part dish featuring Diver Scallop Ceviche, Hamachi Sashimi, and a single Kusshi Oyster. Dazzling. As for the protein, we elected to have the Emigh Farm Lamb Rack with Summer Ratatouille, Eggplant Puree, Padron Peppers drizzled with a deep and rich Lamb Au Jus. Another devastatingly delicious dish. The Trio of Devil's Gulch Ranch Rabbit was also a grand slam. and the three iterations of rabbit are perfectly plated with Purple Barley and Spring Vegetables and \"natural\" Jus. Trust, everything looks just as good as it tastes.\n\nMy god this kitchen is straight like 9:15 on an analog clock...\n\nFor dessert I went with \"The Sunset\" Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant, with Chocolate Ganache, Cr\u00e8me Anglaise, Brandied Dried Fruits. Again, they brought out the A game. I am not a huge fan of sweets but this was a rare time finished everything plated. \n\nLa Folie blew my expectations away and shows that San Francisco can stand toe to tow with any food obsessed city.", "author": "Aaron E."}

It maybe feels as if you were dining in a family owned restaurant in Paris. The influence is french and the Parisian spirit can be felt in each dish. The chef is passionate and the dish as a theme, its like a literature or talking.\n\nThe seared foie gras were one of the largest portion of the foie gras dish I had ever seen. It was mouth full, watering, and the juice was incredible. I had enjoyed every bite out of this dish and aroma was delicate and full of umami.\n\nButter Poached Lobster dish had a very even or balanced portion of each ingredients. The lobster tail was rightly sized and gave that perfect amount of pleasure from each resistant bite. Flavor was well executed while it retained its original lobster aroma.\n\nDay Boat Scallop was just perfectly balanced with right amount of sauce and uni on top. The dish was served at its perfect temperature and the colder temp of uni with seared scallop made this dish even more unique and gave a different texture.\n\nMiyazaki A5 Wagyu was perfect in its form, it was melting in mouth. The wagyu was extremely tender like once similar to A5 steak in tokyo. The sauce was very well complementing without overpowering the original steak flavor.\n\nLastly the devil's Gulch Ranch Rabbit was the most unique dish out of all. The meat was gamey hence the rabbit has this unique aroma. The chef well balanced the gamey aroma with his signature sauce and pickled vegetables. This was my first time tasting a complete rabbit dish. Definitely one of the more memorable experience.\n\nI had enjoyed this restaurant more than any other restaurant I had dined in San Francisco.

I love classic French cuisine and I was little afraid to be let down by La Folie. However, I'm happy to say Yelp did good and this place truly deserves its 4.5 star rating.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCauliflower Soup: Lobster, Romanesco Curry Oil\nGenerous chunks of lobster, although I don't love cauliflower.\n\nDungeness Crab Salad: Green Apple and Fennel Panna Cotta\nCrab was extremely fresh and went well with the green apple. Probably the best first course out of all the ones we tried.\n\nTriple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg on Sweetbreads Pancake, Frangelico Almond\nPesto, Wild Mushroom Salad, Truffle Vinaigrette\nI thought this was just okay. Good, not stellar. The first courses were probably the weakest link. It was basically like a poached egg over a pancake, a bit too salty, and the tempura was not a welcome addition the way I thought it would be.\n\nPan Roasted Black Cod on Sunchoke Puree, Brussel Sprouts and HedgeHog Mushrooms, Truffle Gnocchi, Bacon Jus\nMy friend ordered this and the bites I stole were divine. The cod falls apart with just gentle prodding and is incredibly fresh and tender. The sunchoke puree is a nice accompaniment and, well, 2 words: truffle gnocchi.\n\nR\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab, Stuffed with Wild Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, Truffled Jus\nThe waiter told us this was his personal favorite and I can see why. It kind of reminded me of beef wellington. Very tasty, the quail and squab were incredibly tender and flavorful, and the mushrooms were textural perfection.\n\nWarm Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9, with Fromage Blanc Sorbet, Crispy Bacon, White Sesame Tuile\nWherever I go, I HAVE to order a souffl\u00e9 for dessert if it's available. Most of the time, unless it's at a very fancy restaurant, it sort of fails and tastes more like sponge cake. But the souffl\u00e9 here was divine. Light, creamy, just enough cheese to keep you wanting to lick the bowl (but refraining, of course...)\n\nCandied Buddha's Hand Carrot Cake, Greek Yogurt Sphere, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Cr\u00e8me Brulee, Earl Grey Tea Ice Cream\nMy friend ordered this because she loves carrot cake but she said it was just okay. I hate carrot cake, so I can't comment. haha.\n\nAnother surprise standout were the amuse bouches. I can't remember what they all were, but they were plentiful and ALL delicious. My favorite was probably the salmon, cream cheese and caviar lollipops (I know...)\n\nWe actually decided to come here after Gary Danko was fully booked, but my friend said Gary Danko is overrated and La Folie is way better.

Aside from the buttery, tantalizingly tender, melt in your mouth Wagyu beef my friend ordered, there was nothing better we ate.\n\nThe John Dorry was extremely well prepared, delicate and delicious. Think sound bite from Parts unknown of Bourdain repeating, \"that's good, oh that's good, ah man that's good, that's good, that's sooo good.\"\n\nThe butter poached lobster tail was tremedous. I had the rib eye and it was outstanding. However who wants to eat that after tasting the Wagyu right?\n\nThe fois was seared to perfection and served atop a bourbon poached pear. Fagggghhhetaboutit! So properly presented and terrifically tasty.\n\nTo the desert: the curry squash ice cream served aside a petit soufflet was to die for, so much so that it's amost not worth mentioning the  bonus desert tray of homemade gum drops, caramels and these really extraordiary petits fours that reminded of the french cougnettes actually.\n\nService was impecable. Only negative critique, and perhaps it's just me, but when one is paying those prices for such delicious food, does one really need to be told on the menu and verbally that there are $30 or $75 premiums for a given entree? Isn't there any other way to accomplish that?\n\nOverall extremely content; a very satiating meal amongst friends in a great atmosphere with super delicous food and sensational service.", "author": "Aaron G."}

I seriously thought that we were just going somewhere simple so I was a little underdressed. I'm not sure why it didn't hit me when he picked me up in a collared shirt and tie. :P\n\nWe were 15 minutes late, but this wasn't an issue. We were seated immediately upon arrival. The staff were all courteous. We did ask a few questions and not once did we feel that we were burdening them. No complaints about the service. \n\nThere were three AMUSE BOUCHES to start with and one right before dessert. I will definitely forget the details, but I'll try to be descriptive as possible.\n1. Rabbit Morsel - Unfortunately, I don't remember what this was paired with. I got over the guilt of eating Rabbit pretty quickly (although I don't think I'll ever order it). It tasted slightly gamey.\n2. Organic Egg Yolk with Potato Leek Soup and Brioche - Absolutely delicious. The potato leek enveloped in yolk was heaven in my mouth. I savored every spoonful. The brioche was crispy and was perfection with the yolk soup. \n3. Salmon Lollipops with Marscapone - Very good salmon! \n4. Rosemary Ice Cream on top of Blueberries - I definitely wanted more of this!!\n\nAPPETIZERS\nTaste of Passot Roe - Hooolllyyy. The diver scallop ceviche was divine and my favorite part of this dish. They were tossed in coconut milk for a very delicate finish. There was also hamachi sashimi and a Kusshi Oyster which were both extremely fresh. \nBurgundy Snails - Yummy! The lemon butter and bone marrow gratin complimented each other creating a perfectly rich coating for the snails and the parsley foam was the cherry on top. \n\nENTREES \nSeared Day Boat Scallop - Excellently cooked scallop with a very tasty citrus sauce.\nButter Poached Lobster - I loved this. The English Pea Ravioli was almost as delectable as the buttery lobster. \nLobster and Mushroom Risotto - This was probably our least favorite out of all of the dishes. Nothing really stood out about this dish. \nDuck Breast \"Coq au Vin\" - The thing I enjoyed most was the liver mousse!!! \nR\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab - They had me at \"wrapped in crispy potato strings.\" Great entree. \n\nDESSERT\nBaked Alaska - The bf ordered this because you Yelpers raved about this and it didn't disappoint. Ice cream, cake and meringue... You really can't go wrong with any of those! \nEdam Cheese Souffle - Delicious warm souffle for the cheese lover! This also came with ice cream -can't recall what flavor, but it went well with the souffle! \nPetite Fours - I really can't recall what we had, but they were all enjoyable aside from the gummy one. Not a big fan of those!\n\nAt the end of our meal, we were pleasantly surprised to find that our car was waiting for us outside. My boyfriend and I had a lovely time here. I would definitely recommend La Folie for special occasions.", "author": "Dorothy L."}

The first thing to be noted is that Polk street is hell when it comes to trying to find parking, you really HAVE to use the valet service so don't even bother looking for a spot(don't loose your sanity before eating out at a nice restaurant). \n\nThe menu gave four different options. You can get a 3 course, four course, 5 course meal where you choose the dishes you want in your different courses. The last option it a set menu of 5 courses for $195 per person.\n\nDon't get late night reservations. I would've liked to have made it for sometime between 5:30 and 6:30 bc there is about 20 minutes between each course. This is not meant for shoving something down and running out the door. \n\nDo yourself a favor and don't bring trollish people who don't like to eat or those who don't converse well. You will be with them for a long time and they will make a big difference when it comes to your dining experience. Kill me!!! I won't say any more.....\n\nWe ordered a 3 course meal which is $95 per person and it comes with 5 complementary dishes... An oyster w caviar, a quail egg amuse buse, I think it was frog with a goat cheese sauce? (yum!), a berry shooter, and a petit four trey which consisted 4 different types of petit fours per person. \n\nThe food was worth the price tag, they clearly put in the work for it. I was stressed out when eating here however. I hate raw things. It initiates  my gag reflex and I feel light headed to eat anything raw yet you know the plate is a fortune and you don't want to pass it up... I hate oysters but for a person how hates oysters this was very good. There was a nice sauce in it and caviar. The last oyster I had took me maybe 5 minutes to get down. This time I got it down quickly, i felt light headed tho. If you like oysters you will love this.\n\nThe second stressor was my second complimentary amuse buse. It was amazing really... Had some amazing sweet corn soup in the bottom and a lot of really good crunch. In the center was a quail egg that was cooked soft... Again I felt light headed  but I ate it and if I was into soft cooked eggs I would worship this. It was very good.\n\nThe pigs feet with sweet bread was decent but I thought I would like it more than I did . The best of all was the rabit ....  WAS SO GOOD. Kill me! \n\nFrom start to finish I loved everything (I liked the pigs feet but I didn't love it) it is good quality and they clearly work hard. I love all the complimentary items. Good place for adventurous eaters and people who like raw things. In all honesty the server did ask about allergies... Maybe if I explained my dislike of raw things they would have given me different amuse buses. Call and ask. If not only 2 of the 5 are that way so it's not a major problem or anything.", "author": "Courtney A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-18", "description": "There comes a time in every man's life when he needs to open up his wallet and cross the threshold into the $$$$ territory. Don't you worry don't you worry child, see La Folie's got a plan for you. \n\nFor $100, you get to choose 5 courses from the menu. You're allowed to choose ONE from the Meat&Poultry section, but you can use the rest of your 4 choices on whatever you want. (For instance, you can do 1 Meat&Poultry and 4 Entrees, or just 5 Desserts, if that floats your boat)\n\nHave a drink to celebrate your entry into the $$$$ territory. Sure, it's $15 a glass, but it's a big glass. I got a glass of Chardonnay and they served it in a giant goblet like the Goblet of Fire. Unless you're AA eligible, that glass should last you nicely through the 5 courses. (I didn't even finish it!)\n\nI'm pretty sure every course is spectacular. So I'll just highlight several notable ones that my ladyfriend and I enjoyed. Feel free to skip around as they are in no particular order : )\n\n-THE UNI SALAD-\nAt $100, ordering a salad seems questionable. But the only question I had was \"WHY IS THIS SALAD SO DANGGGG GOOOOOD?!?\" I kid you not, this Uni Salad be stimulating your taste buds to overdrive. And it wasn't just the Uni. Maybe it was the oil, or maybe it was just a divine combination of food. Just believe me, it's GOOD. \n\n-The Taste of Passion Roe-\nLa Folie places fresh Roe (those orange fish eggs) elegantly on Hamachi, an Oyster, and a Ceviche. Everything just tasted really fresh. That sounds so cliche, but it's true. I was really impressed with how delicious everything tasted with so little flavoring. The funnest part is when those little Roes start popping with each bite. *PopPopPop* Sounds just like me getting the bang for my buck : )\n\n-The Squab/Quail Thing-\nWow. Just Wow. It was so pretty that I couldn't bring myself to eat it. But then it was so delicious I couldn't bring myself to stop. La Folie wraps perfectly-cooked quail/squab into this crunchy skin. I can't describe how perfect and how amazing this dish tastes, but I'm going to try. There were a lot of little snippets of flavors hitting your taste buds faster than Kendrick Lamar's verses but it ends with a pleasant aroma that lasts longer and higher than Celine Dion's pitch. The perfect cadence. \n\n-Baked Alaska-\nThis is a fancy dessert that you can substitute in for an additional $10. Just for the picture alone it is worth it. Inside the volcano-looking thing is a marshmellowy substance that tastes like a smore. Honestly, I was too stuffed at that point to fully appreciate the dessert. But the picture, look at the picture. Worth it right? \n\n-Free Things-\nI love free things : ) \nLa Folie showers you with quite a few free tasting dishes. Shout out to the server who brought our dishes over because he was hilarious. A funny fancy restaurant is icing on the cake. The free tasting dish they brought over were quite fancy, and most of them were served on a spoon. There's this one that they bring right before the dessert that's used to clear your palette. It worked magnificently. And I was just using water to clear my palette all these years. SMH. \n\nOther REALLY GOOD DISHES that I didn't review. The Scallop with Squid Ink Spaghetti was my highlight of the night. The Lobster Risotto was delicious, but very filling. The Sea Bass was super soft, i mean like, so soft I don't even have to chew. And many more!\n\nI left with my tummy stuffed and my wallet not so much. But it was worth it. In addition to top-notch food it was also a wonderful dining experience. I can't wait to take my Mom here one day and hear her trying to explain how Chinese food is better. It looks to be a lively debate.\n\nThank You La Folie for a warm welcome to the world of $$$$", "author": "Ringo M."}

It was all down hill from the start.\n\nArrived 7:45 had to get valet attention to come over, gave me the valet ticket and asked if I wanted to pay now or after. I advised after, and then gave me a 3rd option. You can also put it on your dinning bill \"what would you like to do.\"  threw me for a loop, and now I'm scrambling to make a choice. So I made my decision and payed up front gave him $20.00.  Went in side to a crowded entrance with patrons waiting for their tables.  Checked in with the host and was told that they were 15 min behind. No apology given or comp glass of champagne offered.  We stood around for 20 min and finally sat at a table near the entrance.  During the whole dinner I could hear customers complaining of the wait as it went from 15-20 min as the night progressed.\n\nNow for the horrible service.  Our waiter who's name goes unknown, because he never introduced himself comes and offers us tap or mineral water. \"still water please.\" \"which one is that\" he says. \"tap\" I reply.  Sorry but for a highly acclaimed $$$$ restaurant the use of the word \"tap water\" is such a turn off.  Might as well call it faucet water.  As he's pouring our faucet water, my hubby notices that the menu presented is different from the one sent via email.  He asks the waiter if the menu has changed as it looks different from the emailed version. He replies back with \"I can't say as I did not know what was emailed to you.\"  He then went through the menu and made sure he pointed out all the add on's. Which...again... for a highly acclaimed $$$$ French restaurant it made it sound very cheap. $70 - $90 for caviar, $30 to shave black truffle on your main course, $50 - $85 additional charge for a higher quality cut of meat or adding foie.  I thought I was at a car dealership.  He then gave us some time to look over the menu, to ponder if we wanted to add any \"accessories.\"\n\n*** After further comparison of the menu's, 80% was changed with out notice.\nThe only two items that stayed in tact was the Asparagus Soup and the second choice for main course which was the Lobster and Mushroom Risotto.  This really got under our skin afterwards.  Why not send a follow up email saying the menu has changed? I feel cheated, as I came into this restaurant with high expectations shelling out hundreds of dollars, for a tasting menu I was genuinely looking forward too. Only to find out it's been changed and dumb down. Examples.....\n                                                   Main course:  La Passion                         \nEmailed Menu:              Snake River Farms Eye of Ribeye\n            Sweetbread Boudin, Nettle Puree, Potato-Foie Crusted Spring Onions, Madeira Sauce\n\nRestaurant Menu:         Storm Hill Beef Tenderloin\n            Braised Salsify, Nettle Puree, Wild Mushrooms, Madeira Sauce\n\n                                                 Dessert course:  Le Desir\nEmailed Menu:             \"Rouge Emblazed\"\nCremeFraiche Mousse,Burnt RoseCouli,BlackPepper Tuile,Hibiscus Marshmalow, Pomgranat\n\nRestaurant Menu:       \"Framboise Bombe\"\n           Raspberry Mascarpone Mousse and Praline Dacquoise \n\n15-20 min sitting there with only faucet water, an older gentleman who was at the bar looked over and saw we were not being attended too, he came over and took our drink orders. The waiter then returned what seemed to be 30 min, and took our choice for the main course.  He then walked away humming a tune.  Actually he kept humming all night, not sure what that was all about.  We didn't receive our first course until 45 min from sitting down, and the bread only came after we had our first course.  The only good thing I do have to say is the food is good, and presented well.  It wasn't knock your socks off, orgasmic but it was good.\n\nThe whole experience was 2 1/2 hours, the plates were steadily coming out fast as we ate each plate in haste for I think two reasons. 1. because we where starving 2. because we wanted to get away.  We paid the bill leaving most of the tip to the kitchen staff and headed out to the valet. I gave him the valet ticket and the same guy I paid the $20.00 in the beginning asked me if I already paid, or did I put the valet charge on my bill. uhh really?! \n\nOn the way home we jokingly made a comment of \"lets go get some Victors Pizza down the street.\"  But it was no joke. I could of gone for a slice right after the disappointment of La Folie.  Maybe next time we should just go to Victor's Pizza on Polk.\nIn conclusion, yes it was a disappointment and a big dud. The only bright side of it all was that I was able to experience it with my hubby.  This place let us experience lots of emotions, sadness, happiness, anger, and surprise. Never ever again!", "author": "David P."}

After we entered and said we have reservations, there was a wait to get us seated.  I may have gotten a bit used to being led right away to our table once I say we have reservations so this was a bit of a shock :D  So then we looked around and we were disappointed with the ambiance which was just plain modern.  No hint whatsoever that this was a French restaurant which I think is such a wasted opportunity in creating that charming French atmosphere.  Then we were led to our table which was by a post and was uneven since it skewed to the right.  I mean, I called to reserve a week or two before and they were even the ones who asked if there was any occasion so I expected a better table than that.  Then, the wine menu was given to us but with no menu - I like pairing my wine with what I'm eating so unless I know that, I won't know just yet what to get.  Then, the menu came after but was just laid down on our table with no greeting whatsoever?!  So, at this point, I started apologizing to my husband already :D  \n\nFortunately, the food saved the night and I guess our server was feeling off for just those few minutes since when he came back, he turned out to be nice and pleasant.  Hubby and I opted for the 3-course menu which was perfect since the portions were just right.  I started with the crusted black cod which was easily one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.  My main course was the trio of rabbit but they also served it a 4th way in the form of rabbit liver!  I've never had rabbit liver so I was excited and happy that it turned out to be good.  Hubby started with the frog leg and snail ragout presented so gorgeously inside a bone marrow.  This was good but just needed a little bit more seasoning to make it perfect.  Then he also had the butter poached lobster which was really good.  His main course was the duck breast which was highly recommended by our server and rightly so.  This dish was also served with duck tongue which was another first for us and it was fatty, tender and tasted good.  For dessert, we had the peach baked alaska which was divine.\n\nThe meal came with an amuse bouche of dungeness crab croquette and a granita before dessert to cleanse our palette.  The bill also came with 4 different mini treats.\n\nOverall, definitely happy with our meal and more importantly, hubby was happy with his birthday dinner :)", "author": "Kathy C."}

Everything was truly exceptional. It was one of those experiences where I was so stuffed but couldn't stop eating because it was so good!\n\nWe were running really late from the airport but they were very kind and gracious and made us feel right at home.

The way Chef Roland makes the food in taste, quality and presentation, definitely showcases the inspiration and passion he has for French cuisine!  \n\nThroughout the entire dining experience, we had the most captivating waitress because she described every dish with the most whimsical and soothing voice, I have ever heard anyone speak with!  The dishes sounded so delectable the way she said it.  It just made it even more marvelous than it already was!\n\nEach dish was simply special and distinct in its own way and the chef served compliments as well. \n\nChef Roland changes his entrees every season, but keeps a few signatures here and there.  The mixing and matching of your choice for the menu, is a plus.  \n\nHere's a tidbit - I thought that the Goat Cheese as an appetizer, was splendid in flavor and presentation was colorful.  The Rabbit entree was unique and it was my first time trying rabbit meat.  It was on the dry side, unfortunately, but the layout of the dish was catchy to the eye.  The Pork's Feet all grounded up, as bad as it sounds, tasted the best!  It was tender.  It was flavorful and oh so savory! \n\nThe classy, romantic, fine dining that this place exudes with their ambiance, effort and ideas that is shown in their excellent meals and the voice of the server describing each entree as it came out, perfectly showcases top notch restaurant performance!\n\nBest birthday dining experience ever.  \n\nTo top it off, thanks for taking a picture with me, Chef Roland!

Wine pairing is also available.\n\nI'm absolutely thrilled that foie gras is legal in California again and I had the foie gras soup as my appetizer. The soup was a bit on the salty side but the foie gras itself was good. Next on the tasting menu was the butter poached lobster. This one was decent. The venison was good but the side that came with it was really salty. The dessert was called \"the truffle\" which is ice cream inside a truffle flavored shell. It had a really weird texture; kinda sandy. \n\nLa Folie really took the entree to another level of making each one unique, but to a point it can become too much for the taste buds.

Luckily we found parking less than a block away and arrived a bit early. The restaurant was able to accommodate our early arrival. The bar and the restaurant side are a bit confusing, as there was no way to differentiate them. I'm sure people make this mistake all the time.\n\nSeated in an intimate corner, we were promptly given menus and asked for our drink orders. The waitress was professional and the actual service was great, but lacked any personality. We liked the bus boy much more.\n\nOrdered the 3 course meal + wine and IPA and got:\n1 - Amuse Bouche: Uni with other yummy stuff\n1 - Amuse Bouche: Mackerel with beet puree\n3 courses any three dishes selected from the menu list (one main entree only), all were delicious.

The hostess is delightful and she enjoys engaging customers.  The wait staff clearly love their jobs and they perform them with aplomb.  The food is exceptional. There is a very high \"wow factor\" with every dish that comes out of the kitchen.\n\nThey let you create your own meal from the three, four or five course menus as well as the Chef's Tasting Menu.  You can order three appetizers if that is what you desire.  They are not at all fussy.  I brought a bottle of special wine which they happily decanted and they waived the corkage fee when we ordered a half bottle of wine as well.\n\nWe had the Corn Soup which was sweet and delicious; the Foie Gras which was the biggest piece of foie I have ever had, it was seared to perfection and floating in a peach consomm\u00e9; the Day Boat Scallops were tender and sweet; a Salmon dish that was in a miso-like broth and beautifully poached; Rack of Lamb which was tender and moist and a perfect portion; Duck Breast which was served with an artful circle of root vegetables; a Lobster Risotto which if I die tomorrow, I will be happy thinking about the creamy sauce, the chewy arborio rice, the sweet corn and the succulent lobster; and finally desert was a cherry compote (I don't remember the ingredient details but I remember loving every bite of it).  They also provide you with a lovely complimentary sampling of their home made candies.\n\nThe Chef himself came out to greet all of the diners.  I told him our meal was a dream.

I left a prior disappointed review on the French Laundry, and this is everything the French Laundry was not!  First, the service and staff were an absolute pleasure.  Thanks Mandy, our server!  The sommelier was very knowledgeable, approachable and pointed us to what I would consider a value wine for a high end resturaunt, we upgraded to another of his suggestions, but very knowledgeable, approachable and we ended up with a beautiful French wine.  Then the food!!  Each of the courses was a great mix of traditional flavors with creative touches of very fresh local ingredients.  Each course was fun, delicious, prepared to perfection!", "author": "David C."}

The host suggested that we grab a drink at their lounge next door while we waited.\nThe lounge had a full bar and offered various small bites, it very cozy and casual.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, we made our way back to the restaurant where we were greeted by the friendly staff. Our server, Trey was extremely knowledgeable and filled us in on the details of the menu. My boyfriend and I both had the four course menu listed below, paired with a bottle of 2010, Chateau Bel Air (Bordeaux):\n\n\n1) Triple-T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg consisted of truffle Custard, Braised Chicories, Wild Mushrooms, Truffle Vinaigrette:\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered this and this was AMAZING. The duck egg was perfectly cooked and the yolk was complimented by the truffle sauce with truffle shavings. SOO GOOD! (If you love truffle you can ask for extra shavings for an add. cost) The asparagus was also tender and well cooked.\n\n2) Saut\u00e9ed Burgundy Snails cooked in Pernod Lemon Butter, Parsley, Bone Marrow Gratin:\nMy boyfriend ordered this dish and it blew both of us away. I've only had escargot once before and I did not have a great experience, however this was delicious and flavorful.\n\n3) Foie Gras Torchon on Pistachio and Cranberry Bar, Winter Citrus, Mandarin Gastrique:\nBOMB.COM, the foie gras was relish!! It was definitely worth the additional $20 supplement. It was smooth, creamy, and buttery. I can't even find the perfect adjective for this plate, just orgasmic for your mouth! The crispy pistachio and cranberry bar meshed perfectly with the foie gras and gave it a nice bite.\n\n4) Liberty Farm Duck Breast, Sunflower Seed Risotto, Confit Cockscomb, Bergamot Oil, Consomm\u00e9:\nTrey recommended this liberty farm duck dish for my bf and I also highly recommend this! The duck was perfectly cooked and extremely tender. Very high quality duck breast. I thought the sunflower seed risotto would be grainy but it was a bit sweet and crunchy. \n\n5) * R\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab, Stuffed with Wild Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, Truffled Jus: \nWOW, my entree had quite the presentation! The quail and squab combination was cooked at the perfect medium rare. The crispy potatoes gave it a nice touch and smelled so good upon arrival. There was also a cute quail egg perfectly fried in a potato basket.\n\n6) Huckleberry Baked Alaska, Lemon Chiffon Cake, Huckleberry and Lemon-Thyme Ice Creams :\nThe baked Alaska was soooo good, though I thought it could have used more cake and less ice cream. The torched meringue paired with the mascarpone cream helped offset the sweetness of the ice cream.\n\n7) Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9, with Fromage Blanc Sorbet, Crispy Bacon, White Sesame Tuile:\nI loved my dessert and wouldn't change a thing about it. Sweet yet savory souffl\u00e9 topped with awesome bacon bits! The fromage blanc was mind blowing, not too sweet just the right amount of acidic flavor. It was very enjoyable with the sesame wonton-like cracker.\n\nWe were also served 3 amuse bouche that was fantastic as well. Hamachi, Uni in a egg shell, and sweet cream topped with rhubarb. Simply fantastic palette cleansers, mm!! \n\nTruly a top notch experience, from the impeccable food, to service, to the ambience.\n1 Michelin star well deserved La Folie! We will definitely be back!!\n\n5 STARS", "author": "Karen L."}

First of all, they valet - which is needed for this neighborhood (also because we were running late for our ressie.. haha).  The staff greeted us at the door, hostess was professional and welcoming, the interiors were velvety, dark, joyous yet mysterious at the same time.  We were seated in the back room (pleasantly surprised that this restaurant was this big!).  It was quiet and a buzz of conversation - perfect in my eyes for a fun food venture.  Just enough silence for me to close my eyes and praise the food gods... and just loud enough for me to sigh aloud and giggle with joy.\n\nI chose the 4 course which starts at $120: Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras (add $30), Warm Dungenous Crab, Butter Poached Lobster (which was actually on the Chef's tasting menu but they allowed us to pick that as one of my courses), and Snake River Farms Ribeye (add $20).  So my menu choices was at $170, for you dollar bill readers.   The staff told us that La Folie is also known as \"House of Foie\" and listen, I am a foie-lover... so you tell me house of foie and I'm salivating already.  This serving came out and I almost fainted.  It was THE MOST GENEROUS serving of foie I've ever had in my life.  The thing was a steak.  It was paired with a savory sauce that had cherries in it and it was an amazing marriage of salty and sweet and HELL YES.  I typically don't share my foie courses, but due to the portion size - I prepared a bite of two for friend and we both closed our eyes in happiness.  The dungenous crab was lack luster for me.  I wish I would have tried the terrine or the slow cooked salmon.  I did taste the lobster mushroom risotto and that was winning!  The butter poached lobster was delectable.  I've sadly but happily been to French Laundry and that really set the bar for me, but La Folie's was a solid butter poached lobster.  Pleased that I got that as one of my courses.  Lobster was cooked well and flavor was delicious.  The ribeye.... I barely could eat because I was stuffed but for ribeye... I will.  The great thing is that the portions is reasonable.  I mean trust me, with a glass of red wine in my belly -- I was stuffed but my god, was I happy. \n\nBesides the seared foie, I was equally excited about the strawberry baked alaska.  I've had the baked hawaii at Liho Liho and I almost lost myself in the goodness of the ice cream and the honeycomb marsh fluff.  I'm about to faint just thinking of it.  I'm going to say that I didn't quite care for the baked alaska to be quite honest.  I was a little disappointed by it - it lacked the sweetness and the texture that I was anticipating, and perhaps I hyped it up in my head too much.  The ice cream was more icy than cream - as I've had.  Anyways, you know what was a star was the cheese souffle!!! That darn thing is IT!  You need to get that.  \n\nOverall, service - ambiance - taste ... above AOK.. and yes I'm a fan.  Would I go back?  I would for a reason and I'd be more than ecstatic to come back to dine at La Folie -- very very pleased.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-04", "description": "RESTAURANT - 5 stars \nFOOD - 4.5 stars\nSERVICE - 5 stars\n\nI was on the verge of giving this restaurant 5 stars, because the food was definitely fantastic, however now that I've tried several other Michelin starred restaurants and my palate has matured, I have to compare.  \n\n1. PRICE - Similarly to Gary Danko, you can mix and match, though you can only get one type of meat.  However, the price of 3 course menu at La Folie is $90 vs Gary Danko at $79.  \n2. PORTIONS - The portions at La Folie were TINY!! Your last dish is the only full sized plate, as I saw my risotto that came out second was the size of my palm, but the table next to me had risotto in a large plate.  This makes sense, however the portions at Gary Danko was much larger (and cheaper).  I am all for quality of food, but I just wished the portions were a little big bigger.\n3. TASTE - Ah, the most important part.  When coming to a Michelin starred restaurant, you want that \"ahh\" moment, when you take a bite from the chef's creative preparation to give a mix of amazing flavors that combine so well together.  The only \"ahh\" moments I really had were from their Amuse Bouche and the Quail and Squab.  I ordered the day boat scallop (4.5 stars), lobster risotto (4 stars), and butter poached lobster (4.5 stars).  \n**DAY BOAT SCALLOP - 4.5 stars - scallop polenta infused with mushroom and truffle.  You can't go wrong with truffle, but because I am familiar with the truffle taste that it didn't amaze me as much as I'd have hoped. I also wish there was more than one scallop. \n**LOBSTER RISOTTO - 4 stars - this portion was extremely small. The risotto was delicious though I'd have hoped it had a little more flavor as it was a bit light\n**BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER - 4.5 stars - very rich and delicious, taste hints of butter and truffle in a light cream sauce that complimented the lobster well.  \n**HUCKLEBERRY BAKED ALASKA - 5 stars - warm in the outside, ice cream in the inside.  This dessert was baked perfectly and was great to share. \n\nThe Quail and Squab was the dish that surprised both my boyfriend and me, so definitely order that.  I wish I can say more, however this was my boyfriend's dish. You can read his review below, Eddie K.  The bite sized amuse bouches were surprisingly delicious as well.  \n**BRIOCHE - 5 stars - the first amuse bouche was amazing.  Brioche with mushroom and porcini butter and shaved chestnuts.  \n**MOOSE - 4.5 stars - potato leek moose and black truffle.  This was surprisingly good too \n**GARLIC EGG SOUP - 5 stars - garlic soup inside an egg with potato chip and brioche.  This was great!! They gave it to my boyfriend while I got the potato leek moose, though I wish they had given the garlic egg soup to me!\n\nBIRTHDAY - It was my 26th birthday, so they did provide a nice complimentary birthday dessert, one that looked like an edible card!  This was sweet, so thank you La Folie.  \n\nOVERALL - I have to say that La Folie was definitely the most romantic restaurant I've ever been to.  I can see proposals occurring there since the ambiance sets the vibe so well.  The only aspect that was not in my favor were the portions and corresponding price, as well as wanting more \"ahh\" moments to blow my mind. Had I not try 4 other Michelin star restaurants and Lazy Bear, I probably would have given this place 5 stars.", "author": "Raquel Y."}

The hubby and I get out so rarely these days, so we were looking forward to having a special dinner here. The food is more classic French - everything is well executed but just lacked the element of surprise and sparkle. We were looking forward to the lauded foie gras but felt it was a bit overcooked. The entrees of lamb and duck were our favorites of the evening, as was the cheese souffl\u00e9.\n\nThe most memorable part of the night was our waiter Trey, who hit all the perfect notes in being warm and eloquent and making us feel as if we were valued regulars even though this was our first visit at La Folie.

The plan was to go here first and see a play afterwards at the American Conservatory Theatre.  Our reservations was at 5:45PM.  The service upon stepping into the restaurant was superb.  Coat check for free.  Also, they valet for $15.  I wanted to park myself but I got there right at 5:45PM and didn't want to be late as we were already pressed for time.  \n\nInside the lights were dim and you can tell the ambiance and decor were of bourgeois quality.  The waitress sat us down and proceeded to tell us about the menu.  We choose the $110 price point which three dishes.  There was duck egg,  duck breast, and chocolate fondant.  There were also 3 Amuse Bouche dishes.  Every single dish was cooked and prepared to perfection.  The dishes are also very filling.  It is well known that high quality food comes in small portions and leaves you hungry at the end.  However, this was not the case at La Folie.\n\nYou pay a lot but you also get high quality food in generous portions.  The service there alone along with how knowledgeable they are make it 5 stars.  The ambiance and decor there rival other Michelin star restaurants.  The lighting is smooth and dim which creates an intimate and romantic feel.  I would highly suggest this place for something of significance.  \n\nVerdict:\nI'll be back for important occasions!", "author": "Michael W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-01", "description": "Had a great experience here as I did a decently last minute booking of maybe 2 weeks in advance for an anniversary dinner.  When booking my reservation, I did mention it was an anniversary and upon arriving, we were greeted with a \"happy anniversary\" from the staff and seated shortly afterwards.  The waiter was very polite and helpful throughout the night as was the busboys and servers.  Typically I find myself really enjoying the appetizer dishes of a fancy restaurant more than the entrees but here, all the dishes were quite delicious.  Though the menu had a lot of enticing choices, we decided to do the tasting menu and we added a seared foie gras to share.  This was a ridiculous amount of food that we ordered.  The staff was also impressed as we pretty much were able to finish everything except a small portion of the rib eye.  On to the food:\n\nAmuse Bouche: \nChawanmushi I believe which was an egg custard dish presented within an actual egg for you to enjoy.  This was a nice start to our wonderful meal.\nAppetizers:\nBread: I believe it was fresh-baked in-house bread, but it was just okay in our mind.  It lacked the buttery, not good for your health, texture and taste we typically look forward to. \nWestcoast Albacore: Westcoast best coast! Aside from my California pride, we enjoyed this simple dish that had crispy garlic on top and a light broth from the fish.\nEntrees:\nButter Poached Lobster:  This was lovely presented and a delicious dish.  The pasta had truffle shavings which were amazing and the lobster was cooked to perfection.\nSeared Foie Gras($50 add-on): This was too tempting not to pass up so we added it to our dinner and were not disappointed at all.  I never thought to pair foie gras over a bed of cooked fruit but it worked and balanced the rich and heaviness of the goose liver.  \nSnake River Farm Eye of Ribeye:  In my personal opinion, the ribeye was not the star of this dish but the veggies and the beef tongue terrine.  Don't get me wrong as the ribeye was a perfect medium rare which was great.  Perhaps it was me feeling quite full from all the protein from tonight and was finding the rest of the plate more balancing to my dinner order.  \nDessert:\nCantaloupe sorbet as a palette cleanser: wonderfully light and helpful to how full I was feeling\nBrillat Savarin: Rye sourdough with some fruit and cheese and grated truffle.  The cheese and truffle was great.\nSweet Corn and Blueberries:  There was so much corn in a dessert, which was not necessarily a bad thing.  Corn bread with cornbread ice-cream and blueberry sorbet was wonderful.  The balance of the tartness of fruit with the sweet corn was a good way to end the night.  \n\nOverall I had a wonderful time here.  The food was delicious and the experience here was up to my expectation.  I can see myself coming back in the future and I'll definitely recommend my foodie friends to give this place a try.  Meal was roughly $465 for 2 tasting menus, 2 drinks, foie gras add on, tax, and tip.", "author": "Samuel Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-06", "description": "We came here for my brother's birthday, and dinner turned out to be really good! Everyone shared so we were able to sample a lot of different dishes. I'd recommend sharing, because portions here are big for this type of restaurant.\n\nPan Roasted Black Cod - The fish was cooked perfectly. Its skin was delicately crispy, and the fish was very soft. Black Cod/Sablefish is pretty forgiving to work with, since its natural richness makes it hard to overcook. I was really impressed with the sherry bacon sauce. It was bold and full bodied with a smoky highlight from the bacon. The gnocchi were a great on the side because they soaked in all of the leftover sauce. Afterwards, I just used the bread (they were like delicious broken up pain d'epi) to clean up the plate. They need to put that sauce on everything!\n\nTempura Duck Egg - There was a lot going on in this plate. In one corner, the fried duck egg sat on top of the sweetbread pancake, and a frisee salad was placed in the opposite corner. Separating the two, a pool of thick roasted almond sauce was spread across the middle. The waiter recommended spreading the egg yolk over everything so that's exactly what I did. I probably mixed almost everything together, and it's a little overwrought. It's sweet, savory, toasty, nutty, and very slightly tart. I wouldn't say it tasted bad, but it didn't click with me.  \n\nButter Poached Lobster - I really like that we could order items from the tasting menu, so I picked this one to try. The lobster was cooked very well. It had a firm, smooth bite and a delicately sweet flavor. I dunno if it's just psychological, but I always feel that lobster has a stronger umami presence when it's cooked with the shell. The orange sauce was robust and rich. I think it was made with carrots, which gave it a subtle sweetness that complimented the lobster's flavor. The nettle ravioli underneath everything provided a fresh contrast to the rich and savory lobster and sauce. \n\nRabbit - They literally give you half a rabbit. It's meat and more meat! There's a leg, rack, loin, and a pan seared rabbit liver. I was surprised by how mild the rabbit liver was. It wasn't very metallic tasting and was naturally rich enough to balance out the flavor. Of the roasted pieces, I thought the leg was the best one. It was stuffed with mushrooms to add some earthiness and depth to the rabbit's light flavor. The rolled loins and rack were also tender and well prepared, but I didn't think they had the same bold flavors as other dishes. It seems like it'll be good if you're looking for something more rustic. \n\nI have to admit that I'm a fan of this meat and meat with a side of meat concept. I got to try some of the duck entree, which was a roast duck breast and duck confit topped with duck tongue. How can that be bad? From my small sample, I thought it was more flavorful than my rabbit entree. I enjoyed the contrast of the hearty duck confit with the delicate duck tongues. \n\nMiyazaki Wagyu Ribeye - It's the real deal here. They even showed us the cow's wagyu certification. If you haven't tried Japanese wagyu yet, this would be a good place to start. The portion here was pretty generous - maybe 4-5 oz., but it looked like it was just the center portion of the steak since I didn't notice the ribeye cap. That's not a big deal because it was still super tender and decadent. I don't think they could've cooked it any better. It was perfect! The outside had an awesome crispy crust, and the center was beautifully red. The perfect temperature of the meat allows the marbling to render and cover your mouth in a sheen of happiness. I really wish I could smear a dab of that sherry bacon sauce to add just a bit of smokiness. I will definitely come back for more, especially with other places charging more for less wagyu.", "author": "Nei N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "description": "This was one of the best meals I've ever had. La Folie surpassed every expectation in every aspect of our dinner.\n\nLet me start off by saying my mom and I are idiots. My dad gave us a gift certificate and made reservations as a Christmas present. We left the house that morning all excited for dinner, spent time around the city, then headed for La Folie - all while our gift certificate was safely tucked inside its envelope. At home.\n\nThe manager was SO kind and patient and sweet. Luckily my dad had purchased online, so they had a record of it in this humongous binder. It took forever because we didn't know the exact date he purchased, but the manager was just so nice the whole time. The hostess, meanwhile, was also so sweet and she checked in with us and chatted.\n\nFinally, we were seated and picked out cocktails. I got some foofy one with elderflower and Prosecco - delicious. Their wine list was extensive and impressive, but what can I say? I am absolutely powerless to resist elderflower liqueur. Our waitress was very patient with my mom's indecision and helped us navigate the menus. She let us know that we could pick and choose from the regular menu, the vegetarian menu, and the Chef's menu (that one was $10 extra per dish) as we wished, to make either a 3-, 4-, or 5-course meal. We were able to make lovely pescatarian meals with all those choices.\n\nWe started with two amuse bouche: an ahi tuna with wasabi custard and shaved tuna heart, then an egg yolk poached in its shell with some creamy garlicky stuff, topped with the thinnest potato chip I've ever seen. They were both sinfully rich and wonderful, not to mention virtual works of art.\n\nI had the goat cheese tatin, and my mom had crab salad. The sweetness of the crab was nicely brought out by the apple gelee, and the lime caviar was a nice tart contrast. My tatin was divine, except for some kind of tomato cream on the bottom - it tasted like fresh tomatoes, which I despise. That's my personal weird thing, though, and surely everyone else on the planet would love it. My mom also got the snails cooked in marrow, surrounded by parsley foam. It was my first, and probably last, snail. Rich, buttery, fabulous...but I just don't like the texture, and snails are so dang cute, too. My mom loved the little suckers, though.\n\nMy entree was branzino with roasted salsify (they're kind of like carrots?) and brown butter sauce. Had I not already been so full, I would have attacked that plate like Randy in A Christmas Story. It was heavenly. My mom had the lobster risotto, which was equally delicious. However, both were very heavy, so we decided to pack the rest up so we could stuff down some dessert. Priorities, people!\n\nDessert. Ohhhh, dessert. Mom had the chocolate fondant, which is essentially a lava cake...but forget that Applebee's lava cake crap you're used to. This was gooey, soft, warm, rich, dark, and perfect. The creme anglaise was whipped not liquidy, which was a great texture and went nicely with the boozy brandied fruit. My huckleberry baked Alaska, however, was RADICAL. (I'm running out of descriptive words.) It was seriously amazing. The meringue, the sponge cake, the huckleberry and lemon-thyme ice cream...it was possibly the single best dessert I've ever had the pleasure to voraciously inhale.\n\nWith a 3-course meal for $85, I will absolutely be back for special occasions. Portion sizes are very reasonable, and the high quality food and service make it worth every penny. If you've made it all the way to the end of this stupidly long review, congratulations! Go treat yourself to dinner at La Folie - you deserve it.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Now I've never been to the French Laundry but I've heard some terrific things about it and this is probably why I was so excited to try La Folie. The restaurant is located in the ever-lively Polk area, and fortunately it's away from the bars, although there is a La Folie bar/lounge neighboring the restaurant. The main restaurant has 2 dining areas, a room in the front and a green-themed room in the back. The d\u00e9cor is elegant but seems a little dated, but I'm sure this is what they were going for.\n\nService:\nThe service was good although not exceptional. It's the service that I have come to expect from a good restaurant, but not a Michelin Star one. There were no over-the-top actions or super-attentive staff, and although it was nothing to boast about, the service wasn't bad by any means either.\n\nFood:\nThe main thing that sticks out for me at La Folie is how good the free snacks were. The Amuse Bouche in particular, it was rich in flavor and the definitive highlight to my meal. As for the actually dishes themselves, they were good but not extraordinary. \n \nLobster and Mushroom Risotto - I found this to be lighter than other risottos I've had in the past and I liked the foam.\n\nQuail and Squab - There was a small quail egg with this dish which really stood out as the most flavorful part of this dish. The main Quail lacked any kind of \"boom\" flavor for me. At least it was filling.\n\nTasting of Passot Roe - Tasted like sashimi from a Japanese restaurant. I don't know if this is supposed to be a French dish or not, but I didn't notice any major change in flavor. Still I enjoyed this dish.\n\nBaked Alaska - I don't know if many people are familiar with a baked Alaska, but it's a fun dish which combines and ice-cream like base, cake, and a nicely blow-torched outside. The outside should be warm and the inside cold. La Folie had a spot-on Baked Alaska and I definitely enjoyed it. If I could only suggest one item to order, it would definitely be this.\n\nOverall - Although it was not blow-your-mind amazing to me, it was a nice meal in an elegant setting.

Prices are decent for a 3, 4 or 5-course meals at $80, $90 or $100 respectively.\n\nReservations are highly recommended. And this place does have a dressy feel to it, so come in with your nice slacks and a collared shirt. They have 2 dining room areas with the bigger one in the front, and a slightly smaller, yet intimate one in the back.\n\nWe were seated in the main dining room area, but our seats overlooked the whole room which was pretty neat. But it was generally louder in this room. The decor was very nice, with high ceilings and fancy drapery throughout the room.\n\nAs for the meal itself, we chose the 5-course meal. As with other fine dining restaurants, service was highly commendable. And at the price for $100, I find that the price was very reasonable, and sometimes less than other 1 star Michelin restaurants. The fact that it was in SF, is also a bonus since there are a lot to do in the surrounding area.\n\nMy favorite of the 5 course meal is the duck breast and confit leg. Nice, juicy, tender pieces of meat that I enjoyed with the utmost attention. And the apple tarte tartin was my next favorite; sweet and it made it just right for a perfect evening.\n\nUnfortunately, since this is SF, parking can be really difficult to find during dinner time hours, so you can either do the guaranteed valet at $15, or there are some parking structures about 5 blocks away at $2'ish per hour. Good luck on finding street parking too.", "author": "Mike C."}

A dirty fork - a waiter who replies \"like I told you\" in response to a question about the menu. After the waiters rude response, I changed my mind and went with three courses instead of five and abandoned the wine parings for a cocktail to calm nerves after having to request clean silverware and being scolded by the waiter. \n\nNo apology or expression of regret by the staff for the rude comment by the waiter or the dirty silver.\n\nThe lobster risotto was very good as was the reverse Cosmo cocktail. \n\nThe squab was recommended medium rare - but I cannot eat undercooked fowl. I requested it be medium, however, it was served and there was blood oozing out. So gross. Turned my stomach. Had to send it back. \n\nI was going to overlook the rudeness and the dirty fork until the bloody fowl was served. Spoke to someone on staff. Explained the events. The manager defended the chef's preparation of the squab. I Avoided making any scene but clearly stated that forcing the customer to eat bloody fowl against their request is just wrong. Too bad things did not go well - there are so many good reviews of this place.\n\nNovember 16 - called La Folie to give feedback by phone today in case they wanted to hear it. Certainly the evening of our dinner there, no one was receptive to hearing anything about the problems with the meal. \n\nThe chef was polite and concerned about the feedback. I got the impression that he did not believe me though. I still offered him some advice. First, let his staff know that when a customer requests to not have medium rare food - then make sure the staff relay that message to the chef. Clearly in this case, the waiter had not told the chef to prepare the fowl as I had requested. \n\nSecond, I recommended that the chef try to understand that his staff defended his preparation of the food no less than four times. I honestly think the staff is reluctant and even afraid to represent the customers preferences to the chef. \n\nSo, if you like the way the chef prepares food here then you will probably enjoy it. However, I believe there are better places to dine in San Francisco, like Gary Danko and Acquerello. They have excellent food and extremely hospitable staff. Gary Danko was just wonderful. I remember when there was an entree that I was not wowed by, and the waiter picked up on my nonverbal cues, was so concerned and sincere. He basically said, we want you to enjoy everything, let me choose something else. Yes, Gary Danko is much better.", "author": "Michael P."}

The reason is simple: consistently great food and service. The food is classic French with no frills, but they do add that special touch. My wife and I have been celebrating my birthday there every October, and we are heading back again on 10/21 for another fantastic meal. My favorites are the foie gras (when it is available), and the meat specials. My wife always has the fish specials. The menu changes regularly like many restaurants in SF, but the quality rarely (i.e., never) disappoints. The wine selection is respectable, though other places in the city may have a larger selection. The attention to detail by virtually every member of the staff, the near-perfect size of the restaurant (not too big not too small), and fantastic food will keep me coming back.", "author": "Vadim A."}

We ubered from by the pier to the restaurant and we were right on time for our 7:30PM reservation. I reserved via Opentable, they will need a cc on file, and if you don't cancel in time there is a fee that is charged in the form of La Folie credit I believe.\n\nAnyways, we get out of our Uber car and we walk to the door, and we're like, okay this kind of looks like a side entrance? So we walk furthur down and we go in, and we look in the window and it says \"La Folie Lounge\" and its all young people, super loud, with happy hour type seating. So we hike back and go to the door that looks like a side entrance, and what do you know? Thats the real entrance. The bar stretches to the entrance and the host table thing is further in, so that's why we got confused.\n\nOKIDOKEY. so we get seated and the plates are so pretty, as you can see from my pictures.\n\nWe decide to start off with alcohol. DUH! so the sommelier come over and lets us taste a couple wines and my p'sis decided on some fancy schmancy one from France. I forgot the name but it was good! perfect balance of sweet but dry. \n\nOkay, I decided to go with the 4-course meal where you get to pick 4 from their dishes. Appetizer, Seafood, Meat, Dessert. I debated between three or four because I'm sorry but I just could not deal with eating rabbit or squab. But two seafood dishes sounded delicious so I decided on four. \n\nAmuse Bouche 1: brussel sprouts with cauliflower mousse - yummm\n\nAmuse Bouche 2: egg truffle soup, potato crisp - yummy but I got really frustrated scooping the egg out with the little spoon so i just dumped it all in my mouth like a shot. idgaf. sorry. but I did it really fast so nobody saw ;)\n\nAppetizer: Tasting of Roe: trout roe infused with three different flavors. 1 over oyster, 1 with hamachi sashimi over seaweed salad, and I forgot what the last one was, but it tasted like scallops in some sort of cream sauce. (I didn't like this one, I could only eat like 2-3) It was a really strong flavor.\n\nBread: The bread was also alright. it was kind of hard after it cooled off, but its okay, its bread\n\nSeafood #1: Scallops with Uni and Pasta. This was sooooo yummy, I gobbled it down so quick. I loved everything about this dish, the pasta was green so I assume it is made out of healthy ingrdients lol. and it was so thin and delicious, and it came with green sauce, pesto-y but it wasn't pesto. The scallop was huge and on top came a nice big piece of uni. OMG. everything that I love besides cheese. Probably my favorite dish of the night.\n\nOkay at this point I'm getting SUUUUPER full and I'm like wtf. how am I doing to finish? But I keep going...\n\nSeafood #2: Lobster Risotto with Burgundy Truffles: Honestly, I would just skip the burgundy truffles, if you're going to get it just go all out and get white. The Burgundy one was all right. It comes with a fat lobster tail on top. It was creamy and delicious. However, I wanted to save room for dessert so I packaged a lot of it.\n\nDessert: Baked Alaska: Yummy. I'm glad I picked a dessert that wasn't toooo sweet because I was so full I needed that lemon meringue-y tarty finish. My first time having a baked alaska and it was delicious. A perfect ending.... right?\n\nWRONG!! I forgot there petite fours omgawd. I could only eat 2, the chocolate one, which tasted like fererro rocher WAS DELICIOUSS\nand the jelly, the jelly was.... very gelatinous. lol. so it was okay. \n\nWe were so full but so satisfied. \n\nMy friend ordered the Wagyu which is +$75 to your course meal but it is A5 grade the highest grade you can get, it was delicious of course I stole a bite. \n\nI'm still dreaming about the tastes today. #droools.", "author": "Rachel C."}

Reservations were not hard to get. We were able to book a table for two at around 7:00pm a week in advance. \n\nThe menu features the choice of a three, four, or five course dinner depending on what you prefer. We knew five courses would have been too much so we opted for the four course meal and trust me... It made us so stuffed! In addition to four courses each, we also had a two small bites from the chef to start our meal as well as some petit fours to end our meal.\n\nOne of the small bites from the chef was a poached egg soup that came in an actual egg. It was served with a potato crisp and a toasted brioche. It was absolutely delicious. We dipped the crisp and brioche into the soup and they paired together really well. \n\nFor appetizers, we had a ceviche with three different types of seafood, served with caviar. Very fresh, and a good, light start to the meal. We also had a fried duck egg with truffles. That was very flavorful if you take a bite of everything mixed together on the plate. \n\nFor our next course, we both had lobster but we had it made differently. I had the lobster risotto, which was a small portion but it was very moist. My boyfriend had the lobster from the left side of the menu made into an appetizer. It was delicious with a mix of lobster and veggies. \n\nFor entrees, we had two very delicious dishes. These were our favorite of the meal. The Wagyu (and additional $75) was absolutely delicious. It practically melted in our mouths. My boyfriend had ordered this one but I basically ate more than half of his wagyu. It was just so good that I couldn't help myself! We also had a rabbit made four ways. I can't remember them all but you had the liver, the leg, the ribs, and one other thing. I really liked the leg and the liver. You also get an assortment of tiny vegetables. \n\nFor wine, we brought our own wine for a $50 corkage fee. I've learned that it's probably more worth it to bring your own wine to restaurants and just pay the corkage fee. This was especially true because my boyfriend had received a nice bottle of wine for his birthday from his boss so what better time to drink it than during his birthday dinner! \n\nThe service was wonderful. Our server and the entire staff was very courteous the entire time. They checked on us often and made sure we were okay. At the end of our meal, the chef even came out to ask about how the food was. Plus, he wished my boyfriend a happy birthday. How sweet of him! \n\nJust to give you an idea of roughly how much you might spend, for our entire meal (before tip), I believe we paid about $400 for two of us. \n\nI loved La Folie and cannot wait to come back again :)", "author": "Connie Y."}

One can't go wrong with bacon and cheese in a dessert. Yummy!\n\n-   Valrhona Chocolate Bread Pudding = green tea white chocolate ganache with strawberry topping and ice cream was delectable and mouth watering good. \n\nWe also had complimentary dishes such as amuse bouches, poached egg with brioche and potato crisp ( it was so good), palette cleanser after our meal and sample desserts. \n\nMy fine dining experience at this restaurant was tremendous.

Luckily, La Folie allows you to mix and match from apps, seafood, other specialties, etc. like Gary Danko does. 3 courses go for $80, 4 for $90 and 5 for $100. You can even have TWO desserts if you wish! \n\nLet me just say that every dish was simply ORGASMIC!  \n\nWe definitely opened the night on a grand note, a half ounce of Russian Osetra Caviar served with potato blinis with Lobster and cr\u00e8me fraiche. Can you say luxuriously decadent?! \n\nThe other dishes soon followed after: the tempura duck egg on sweetbreads pancake with truffle vinaigrette, Liberty Farm duck breast with smoked duck tongue, seared day boat scallop with foie gras rossini and pan seared beef tenderloin with bone marrrow custard in truffle Madeira sauce. \n\nSince we dined here before the foie gras ban took effect, we were able to enjoy the uniquely prepared foie gras soup, served with truffled crackers and a side of seared foie gras. And if you're thinking, \"well, that's not enough foie gras,\"  we also got their signature item  the seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with caramelized cherries jus and aged maple syrup. I've never been so happier with a big chunk of foie perfectly complemented by the cherries!\n\nAt this point, we haven't even gotten the the cheese course and dessert when the bf said, \"I can't eat anymore!\" \n\nWell, this is where I come in!  ;D\n\nThe Carbiner was an Alpine style, unpasteurized raw tomme cheese which has a waxy texture and a nutty flavor. Slice a bit of cheese, spread a bit of honey and pick up a forkful of the Frissee salad. Who thought of this combination?! GENIUS. \n\nDessert was a bittersweet chocolate and foie gras mousses on a crunchy feuilletine, hazelnut praline sponge cake and bacon ice cream. HELLO?! Foie gras AND bacon on the same plate? I wanted to cry... Tears.  of.  Joy.\n\nService was professional and impeccable, meeting the standards of a Michelin star rated restaurant. Chef Roland Passot made his rounds stopping by at the table to personally thank us for dining at La Folie. I teased him and said, \"what are you going to do now that foie gras will be banned in California?\"\n\nHe winked at me and said, \"simple, we will serve it under the table!\"  You bet I signed up for their email list!  ;-) \n\nLa Folie does foie gras and truffle dishes well, but what really keeps the patrons coming back here is the well executed, unpretentious French food.

They give you 4 oz. of meat (which is a lot compared to other restaurants!) and it literally melts in your mouth like butter. It was the best steak I have ever eaten in my life.

Came here for a one year celebration dinner and I felt out of placed. The crowd was much older than us, that was the only part I was uncomfortable with. The restaurant was fairly compact, one room for the lounge where you have to step out the streets and literally walk next door over, and two rooms for dining. Overall, very warm and cozy, and with very comfortable seats.\n\nI've experienced some excellent service at La Folie this past weekend. Our server, Eva was amazing. She was on top of all our needs, including my love's diet restrictions. He had a dining disaster at a restaurant that I adore, where he couldn't really eat over half of the dishes served. Glad that Eva kept an eye out for us. \n\nFood portions are generous, I felt stuffed by the time I was done with my first two courses. They have two different menus, one where you can choose your courses, the other is chef's choice. I chose the 4 courses with an Abalone and Uni Salad, Tasting of Passot Roe served with oyster, scallop, and kampachi sashimi, Lamb Loin with diced squash over eggplant frittata, and ended with a cheese souffle. Of course, a fatty like me would get to try some of my date's Californian Sea Bass with tempura squash blossom and Quail and Squab stuffed with mushroom and wrapped in potato strings.\n\nI was stunned at how the dishes were presented. Very artsy. Some of the set up like my eggplant frittata from my lamb dish and my salad reminded me of L'atelier in Vegas. When I first saw my roe appetizer, I didn't know where to begin.  The dish my date and I enjoyed was his Quail and Squab. You can see the layers of flavors and textures, the looks of it can be a bit overwhelming. All of our dishes were very solid in tastes.

For the main entree I tried the roti squab and quail and the seared duck breast. For dessert, the souffl\u00e9 and baked Alaska was a sweet ending to our evening. The champagne and Pinot noir went well with dinner.  Very good dinner and well worth the 2 hour drive to get there!", "author": "Diana T."}

I swear I'm not, but la folie needs to get it back together. \nThe first time we went was for my birthday and I would of given la folie 4 maybe 5 stars. The ambiance is nice, our server was an absolute gem and the somm (Passot's brother) was lovely and gave a great recommendation based on what we said we liked. The food was nice. We had - few apps that weren't that memorable but fine, the foi, our mains were lamb and duck and we had a baked Alaska. Overall a pleasant night. \n\nThe second visit was incredibly unenjoyable. Our server seemed new and not well trained from the get go. He then wound up forgetting some stuff that we ordered as well as the order we asked the dishes to come out in as we were sharing a few apps first. Sharing soup seemed like a strange idea that he defended without apology. The \"somm\" we got this time is a new gm and (ok this is kind of mean, but...) he had a used car sales man vibe about him. The wine recommendation was not at all up our alley despite us being pretty specific about likes/dislikes. And not that this is a huge deal but all the tables around us were getting small dishes in between courses which we did not get. We asked about it and he just said they are special guests referring to one of the tables. There's no way all the tables around us were special guests. Lastly our food was not great. The apps were ok. The egg and fish dishes were great, soup was ok, my husband got the lamb again and said it meh, I got the duck dish and it was a mess (rabbit was overlooked and everything on the plate was cold). \nI mean none of that stuff is a big deal on it's own (except the food, I'm not sure what happened there) but combined just made the night completely unenjoyable. \n\nGo back to being good!!!

We did some research and figured what better way than to say au revoir to foie gras at the \"French Laundry of SF\" (although I don't believe this comparison is true by any standards. La Folie is in no way comparable to TFL!) Service was decent but not really up to michelin star standards. The restaurant was quite busy (i'm assuming everyone was on the same boat we were with the foie gras). \n\nI do like that they offer an \"a la carte\" type menu where you can pick your 3, 4, or 5 courses of your choice like gary dankos. From some of the reviews, I decided not to go with the foie gras tasting menu. They still provide you the option of choosing items from the foie gras tasting menu though, which is pretty cool. I decided to go with 4 courses (although i should've gone for 3 bc i was pretty full after about 2 courses with 2 amouse bouches, and some bread). The entire meal took over 2 1/2 hours. \n\nI ordered:\n\nThe dungeness crab salad (presentation was gorgeous, but i expected better taste. It was good but not great). The pea panna cotta was creative but didn't taste very good. \n\nThe seared day boat scallops with foie gras and asparagus. Again good but not great. I've definitely had better.\n\nThe butter poached lobster with pea ravioli with truffle. They were quite generous with the lobster. it was probably my favorite dish of the night. But to be honest, by the time i started eating this dish i was so full, i don't think i was able to enjoy it as much.\n\nLastly, as my 4th course, I ordered a dessert for us to share. I ordered the chocolate bread pudding with green tea ganache. I forced myself to take a few bites with a couple sips of coffee and i was dunzo!\n\nI had a total of 6 courses (including 2 amouse bouches). I was SO FULL i couldn't sit straight. We also was presented with petit fours which would have made it 7 courses, but we just had them pack it up for us to bring home.\n\nHe ordered:\n\nThe foie gras soup which came with truffled crackers, seared foie gras and baby turnips. It was one of his fav dishes of the nite. I had a few bites, and it was actually quite tasty and the foie gras was quite generous for an appetizer dish.\n\nThe seared foie with cherries ($20 supplement) was ginormous! It was probably the best rendition of foie gras that i tasted that nite. \n\nThe lobster and mushroom risotto was just \"alright\" per the hubby.\n\nFor his last dish, he had the trio of rabbit. He enjoyed the dish but again, he was so stuffed by this point, he was upset he couldn't enjoy it more. \n\nIf you have a huge appetite, i'd recommend the 4 or even 5 course menu. Overall, the meal was good, but not very memorable for a michelin star restaurant. Not sure if i'd return.", "author": "Gina N."}

The service is just unbelievable - I drink a lot of water and literally never noticed when they even came to refill it (or maybe this is because I had such a good date to talk to throughout the night heh) and my water glass was never empty throughout the 3 hours that we were there! It was like magic. The servers are also wonderful to talk to and extremely patient and helpful when we had questions about the menu items.\n\nDespite being pricey (it is a Michelin restaurant after all...) the portions are huge and the food is amazing. By the time we got to our main course, we were both pretty full! We were greeted with amuse bouches throughout the night and also complimentary petite fours for dessert.\n\nI love how you can choose any number of things from the menu - we actually chose 2 appetizers and 1 seafood AND 1 meat entree. I think the night we went it was uni night or something so the menu had a lot of those things. It was my first time trying uni which was...an interesting experience. I could not handle it at first but the taste has grown on me. \n\nI can't wait to go back. La Folie is such a romantic setting and my experience there (service + food + ambiance) was unforgettable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-08", "description": "La Folie has a two dining options: either a 3 - 5 course-tasting menu, or the chef's tasting menu. Wine pairing's are available for each option. Not wanting to be too full, we choose the tasting menu in which you could pick and choose your dishes under the menu's different headings. For starters I had the Triple-T Ranch tempura duck egg with delta asparagus, morel mushrooms and English pea ragu, in truffle vinaigrette. This was my second favourite dish of the night (after the foie gras) as the egg was cooked perfectly, and the yolk ran exquisitely into the dish accompaniments. The tempura batter was not too heavy and just added a fine crisp to the meal. My only complaint is that the dish was only warm and would have been better if it were hotter.\nMy brother and I split the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with wild huckleberries and aged balsamic vinegar sauce for our second course (pictured above on the right). This was BOMB.COM. A $30 supplement was added for this, but the hearty portion made it worth the while (well I wasn't exactly the one paying, but I think I can vouch for my Mom). Splitting this dish is definitely a good idea, however, as the richness of it can be overwhelming. Overall it was a standout dish for the night.\nMy next course (still haven't arrived at the main!!!) was a lobster and mushroom risotto. Tasty, with a generous serving of lobster I liked the flavours but wished it was, again, a little hotter, and also thicker - the sauce was a little thin and soupy for my liking. Finally, I ended my meal with the Liberty Farm Duck Breast, with sunflower seed risotto, bergamot oil, and consomm\u00e9. I was a little too full at this point and probably didn't enjoy this dish as much as I could have. It was cooked perfectly however I wasn't too fond of the seasoning. Tasted a little too 'ducky' and not meaty - could just be my personal preference however.", "author": "Nicole W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "My girlfriend and I had the chef's summer tasting menu with wine parings and it was very good, which is to say disappointing. I had spent a lot of time on food blogs and reading reviews and people raved about La Folie. I took my girlfriend here as a treat for a special occasion and I was hoping for an experience we would both remember. Instead, we got a solid meal.\n\nYears ago, I went to a truly amazing restaurant, Cyrus, and it made the whole concept of \"fine dining\" seem rational. I understood why people go to such lengths to find these restaurants and spend such seemingly insane sums to eat there -- because it can become more than just eating, it can be a delight for the senses, an experience. \n\nFrom the presentation, to the service, to the flavors, to the ingenuity, to the flawless execution, Cyrus blew me away. \n\nSo perhaps my expectations for La Folie were too high. For example, my girlfriend knows a lot about wine and I enjoy learning more, so we asked our waiter to tell us about the wine pairings as they arrived. This created a lot of confusion. Our initial waiter wasn't familiar with the wines. That's fine, he asked if we wanted to hear from the sommelier. The sommelier came over and essentially told us what was on the bottle (year, varietal), and as I was in the middle of asking a question (I was curious about why it was chosen for the pairing or what kinds of flavors I should be tasting) he turned and walked away. That's fine, maybe he didn't hear me, and it was a Saturday night so I'm sure he was busy with other tables. I heard him arguing with a waiter about a woman who wanted to speak to him at another table, and how he didn't want to deal with her, so maybe he was having a bad night. For another pairing, a third waiter was asking our waiter if he had shown us the bottle or anything and he said he hadn't, so she came over and said a little bit (maybe our waiter was new and still learning how the restaurant did things -- they don't bring out the bottles and pour them, so glasses just arrive without announcing what they are). For the other pairings, the sommelier returned sometime during the dish and said a bit, but nothing particularly insightful or helpful. He offered that one wine was \"mineraly\" and told us another wine was grown at 1000 feet. There were other minor things, like they only refilled the water once, the waiter couldn't remember ingredients of dishes when they were presented, etc. Nothing big, nothing bad, just disappointing in relation to the premium price and compared to the extraordinary service at Cyrus.\n\nThe food itself was quite good. There were two amuses bouches, then an excellent hamachi crudo with avocado and nasturtium (which showed up later in the dessert, showing a lot of thought had gone into the menu). The lobster was surprisingly overdone and rubbery, and I didn't care for the lemon grass pairing. The ribeye was great, perfectly seared, and then there was a small cheese plate and a parfait with nasturtium ice cream. That was the most imaginative offering and one we enjoyed the most. The wines were good, especially the Ampere cab paired with the steak. \n\nOverall, a very solid, well-prepared meal with only one real miss (the lobster). For $700, though, I was left disappointed that it didn't rise to something more.", "author": "Michael G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-18", "description": "I've said this before, but it's so hard to pick a romantic/fancy restaurant to celebrate a special occasion in SF. There are so many amazing restaurants to consider! This year, we decided on La Folie after several friends assured us that it was the perfect romantic setting for a celebration.\n\nI should first mention that we ate here on our dating anniversary, and my fiancee had just proposed to me less than an hour before our dinner reservation. Of course, we were on cloud nine and felt so excited to have our fancy celebratory meal at La Folie!\n\nYes, the food was spectacular, but there was one HUGE HUGE misstep that made a magical night not as magical. I was so surprised at how poorly this establishment handled it. Here's what happened:\n\nA close friend of ours knew that fiancee was going to propose right before our dinner. She called La Folie in advance to send us a bottle of champagne right when we sat down for our meal. So sweet right? So, we walk in and I tell them my name and we sit down. No champagne, but it's fine because at this point we didn't know to expect it. I suggest ordering champagne to fiancee, but he says we should wait until we get home because we have a bottle of Veuve we've been saving (and our friends were waiting back at the apartment to surprise us, but I didn't know that at this point.) It takes a while for us to order and get through our amuse bouches. \n\nAbout half an hour after we arrived, another couple sits three tables away from us. The waitstaff immediately brings them a bottle of champagne. I think, \"Oh, that's nice that they get champagne. Maybe I should've been more insistent about ordering it.\" Then, I look away, but I hear my name. There is a tiny bit of a commotion and I *think* I hear one of the staff say, \"Oh! I thought you were Jenn B--!\" \n\nAt this point, I connect the dots. Our friend had sent bottles of champagne to other friends who got engaged, so I assume that she did the same for us. I expect the staff to bring us the bottle soon. It would be too awkward for me to say to the waiter, \"Excuse me, but I think that surprise champagne was for me.\"\n\nTwo courses go by. I'm still thinking about the champagne because I don't want my friend to be charged for it if she really did send us a bottle. I decide to take out my phone to text her and ask. She confirms that she did send us a bottle and is LIVID. At this point we are in the middle of our 3rd course. I'm texting her to thank her for the gesture but say that it's unnecessary. She is on her other phone calling the restaurant, and I can hear them apologizing profusely to her. A few minutes go by and they finally bring us the champagne, but at this point we are midway through our 3rd course so we try to decline the bottle (we don't drink and drive) but they tell us to just take it home. \n\nWhat would have been a really thoughtful, sweet and perfect surprise was essentially ruined, and the cost of the bottle was still forced onto my friend. I was shocked that after they delivered the bottle to the wrong table, they didn't even try to redeliver the bottle to us until my friend called to yell at them. It was terribly awkward. \n\nWith so many amazing options in the city, I'd think twice about coming back here.", "author": "Jenn C."}

Nice.  Valet, $15, if no cash, they can add to your tab.\n\nBathrooms: ONE unisex bathroom, but guests were also being escorted to the lounge. There is pretty much no room for waiting, unless you want to get in the way of the staff.  \n\nIt irks me when I see others getting a freebie during the meal and not receiving the same. Several of the diners around us got a lollipop course, upon looking at the photos uploaded, it was a cured salmon.  \n\nHighs:\n*Butter poached lobster, cooked perfectly, loved the ravioli beneath\n*Roti of quail and squab, unique, flavorful, presented well and truly delicious\n\nLows:\n*Lobster risotto was terrible, we've never not finished ANY risotto, this one was sour, looked like cottage cheese and tasted like cottage cheese, it was recommended for truffle shavings atop, that would not have saved it, a chef would have gotten the boot for sure on Top Chef if this was served\n*Tasting of Passot Roe, the roe is not good enough to be featured in a trio, it was a disaster of flavors overpowering each other and just not good\n\nOverall just too many savory panna cottas and emulsions which didn't provide flavor to the dishes, many times masking the flavor of the ingredients.  I'm used to going to restaurants where the vegetables and protein flavors dance on the tastebuds.\n\nThe value of the meal is there: 5 courses for $100, only one meat and fish can be chosen, but they are flexible with the remaining 3 items.  Wine pairing was merely $65, but the wines were not the best quality or spot on.

Each of us ended up packing an entire course to go, and complaining the entire way home that our stomachs were going to burst. The best thing about the courses is you can pick from whichever section of the menu.

The design of the dish and the colors were absolutely amazing!\n\nRussian Osetra Caviar (optional) - we opted to try this as osetra caviar has been one of my favorites. The waiter suggested first to try the caviar alone before trying it with the potato blinis (like a pancake) with lobster to get the true taste of the caviar. I agree and actually thought that having the caviar alone with a little bit of creme was the best way to eat it but the lobster and \"pancake\" definitely added a different complexity to it\n\nAhi Tuna Tartare and Abalone Salad - good but not super memorable. But I do love abalone, something about that texture and chewiness always makes me happy\n\nAsparagus Soup - simple and light but packs a lot of flavor!! It actually blended quite well with the lobster and while I love smoked salmon, it didn't do it for me in this dish.\n\nPan Seared Black Cod - Black code is one of Lance's favorite fishes and he loved this one. It was tender and full of flavor. Since black cod is already sort of buttery already, the brown butter jus enhanced the flavor in my opinion\n\nRoasted Sonoma Squab Risotto - I added the optional white truffle to this dish which meant white truffle shavings sprinkled around the dish. Lovely addition as risotto always goes well with truffle! The squab was juicy as well but not to die for\n\nPeanut Butter Opera Cake - I love opera cake! One of my favorite desserts but the sad thing is I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter.  But this was still a delicious dessert and the flavors were well put together. I loved the hibiscus sorbet, so light and flavorful!!\n\nThey also gave us cute little boxes of chocolates, which I tried later and omg, yum!\n\nOverall, a great dinner. Lance was craving authentic french cuisine and while this is a french restaurant, I think he was a little disappointed in hoping for more traditional french. He felt this was more of an American (new) more than french dining. However, we both still loved the dishes but might not stand out as one of the best dinners we've had.", "author": "Chloe Y."}

Their seared Hudson Valley Foie is very, very generous and just as delicious - beautifully presented.  Their foie gras soup is absolutely a-ma-zing!  I even had foie gras mousse in my dessert with chocolate mouse and cassis gelee.  It may sound weird but the salty, sweet and tangy all worked well together.\n\nBut they're more than just about the foie.  We started off with a few amuse bouches.  The yellow fin with the creamy and chili sauce was my favorite, leaving me wish there was more than just one bite.  The salmon lollipops looked fun but were a bit salty.\n\nMy husband's Roti of Quail & Squab was juicy.  The crispy potatoes were so good.  I loved the Lobster & Mushroom Risotto, which was loaded with lobster.  Normally I would have complained about its humble size but I was full of foie so it didn't matter...\n\nI highly recommend the \"Peach Melba\" Baked Alaska.

The desserts were exquisite, especially since I'm a sucker for sweet things. Took the amuse bouches home since I was too full at the end, but I definitely look forward to coming back here!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-19", "description": "Finally got to dine at another SF institution that I've been dying to try..La Folie!  Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and our server was wonderful.  Oh, easy, valet at the front for $15.  We each got a glass of wine, he got a Merlot, and I got a Riesling.  If you like your Riesling dry, you'll like their's, if not, then don't order it.  I like mine on the sweeter side.\n\nWe devoured:\n\n1.  Amuse bouche: Tomato gazpacho gele with creme fraiche.  Perfect, refreshing introductory bite.\n2.  Bread: Hot delicious carby pain epi-look a like.\n3.  Amuse bouche: Organic egg yolk soup with brioche stick.  So damn good...especially if you're a fan of runny egg yolk (obviously).  \n4.  My first course: The lobster & mushroom risotto plus $20 supplement for plenty of truffle shavings.  It was very light and the lobster meat was sweet.  There was also plenty of foam.  The splurge for the truffles was a night touch and perfect compliment.  GD's lobster risotto is still the winner though, but La Folie's is second, as it was very light, needed a little more of a punch.\n5.  His first course: He ordered from the Chef's Menu ($10 supplement fee), the Butter Poached Lobster.  His was the winner!  The big lobster tail was served on a wild nettle ravioli with Truffle Beurre Fondue, Wild Arugula Salad and Marcona Almond.  OMG that was so good.  I was so jealous, the truffle, the ravioli, the almond, everything worked so well together.  And of course the sweet meaty tail.  Can you imagine the truffle shavings with this too?\n6.  My main was the Liberty Duck Farm Breast with Duck Confit.  Served with fresh peaches and haircot vert, walnuts, and little did I know, some duck tongue.  The duck was cooked medium rare (our waitress asked me first) and was so delish.  The skin was perfectly crisp, and it wasn't overly rich..and the confit, was super tender!  The peaches were perfectly ripe and sweet, the perfect compliment.  I didn't dare to eat the tongue.\n7.  His main: Le Bouef..($20 supplment).  It was a beef trio of an Angus beef tenderloin, braised short rib, and a Wagyu beef slider.  He asked for medium rare, but the tenderloin looked to be cooked more medium or medium well.  It was still tender though.  The wagyu slider was so cute and perfectly cooked.  The shortrib was nicely marinaded and tender too.  I think the slider may have been my favorite on his plate.\n8.  Palette cleanser of a plum and rosewater shooter.  I don't care for plums, but this was good and so refreshing.  \n9.  My dessert: Warm Sunset Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant.  Filled with oozy chocolate ganache, creme anglaise, and brandied fruit.  It was so decadently delicious!  Way better than Roy's chocolate lava cake.\n10.  His dessert: Warm Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9, with Fromage Blanc Sorbet, Crispy Bacon, White Sesame Tuile.  He went the savory route because it was different and bacon is always good!  The cheese souffle was nice and light as well as the sorbet.  Not a stinky cheese thing going on here.  Reminiscent sort of like cream cheese or mascarpone kinda.\n11.  Little dish of cookies...too full to eat them there, we took them to go, but they were still good the next day; especially the chocolate mousse like square!\n\nLa Folie definitely deserves the praise it gets from it's impeccable service to it's innovative and wonderful cuisine to its charming intimate dining area.  They are quite generous with their portions and complimentary offerings.  Pricing is still reasonable starting at $80 for a three course; however, supplements do add up here.  One of the best fine dining establishments I've had the privilege of trying in...thanks bf!!  :-)", "author": "Cat C."}

This last weekend, I returned the favor.\n\nI love La Folie because it served beautifully presented food at a very reasonable price for the quality.  They do things right.  From the tasteful decor to the hostess taking our valet ticket to make sure the car was waiting for us as the meal ended, this is a restaurant that knows how to run itself.\n\nOur meal was almost too decadent.  The chef started us out with not one but two amuse bouche dishes.  This was almost too much, especially since every course was very generously portioned.  I was full by the time I finished my first ordered course (the fantastic Tasting of Passot Roe -- huge dish with tons of briny roe).  I couldn't quite finish my duck (a shame, because it was excellent with the perfectly seared breast and tender confit), and luckily my husband was enamored with my chocolate fondant, because I wouldn't have managed more than a bit.   I can't imagine ordering more than 3 courses here!  Luckily, our server was happy to wrap up the petit fours in a cute box, because it would have been a shame to miss out on those.\n\nI loved my food, but I thought my mother's octopus and uni dish was much more innovative, and the Miyazaki Wagyu that she had for her entree was phenomenal.  I also found that my husband's lobster risotto was excellent with very generous chunks of sweet lobster.\n\nI enjoyed the wine list.  We started with a great Pinot, then my husband and I shared a half bottle.  I found the prices very reasonable.  I would have liked the wine to be decanted rather than served out of the bottle, but perhaps our wine was young enough not to require decanting.\n\nWhy only 4 stars?  Only because our server was a bit overworked, and perhaps her stress caused her to be a little less pleasant than I expect of the waitstaff when I eat at a fancy restaurant.  I will overlook service issues at dives, but when you get to a certain level of dining, your experience becomes more than just the food.\n\nI hope that this was an off-night, because having inadequate service does put a damper on one's memory of a meal, but I do love the food here, and I do plan on returning.", "author": "michelle l."}

Two amuse-bouches (which is just nice!), followed by a well-balanced and beautiful looking Hamachi crudo. The butter-poached lobster was astonishingly rich, but not at the same time, guarded by precisely cut radish-slices. Naturally, the Ribeye was so well cooked, with amazing charring and a smokiness that was so well supplemented by the sweet potato mousse. All finished with Tomme and crispy honeycomb and a berry parfait. While the honeycomb was just perfect (gawd, I love honeycomb), I could have skipped the Nasturtium ice cream. It was a nice full-circle, as (I think) the Hamachi also included Nasturtium, but it was a tad too savory as \"la fin.\"  \n\nAlthough there's so much praise, there's also the occasional misstep by the waiter, like forgetting the grape varieties of a wine. It was also the very first time that I had wine pairing where the wine was pre-poured in my glass. It's not that I don't trust them, it's just a different experience when someone pours the wine for you--in front of you--instead of just handing a glass and having the bottle on the side. \n\nAll in all, an amazing menu for a warm summer day!

We made reservation at 4:45 and we got there at 5 pm due to the traffic, they seated us quickly since it was still early. We got our first course around 5:45 and got our bill at 7:52 which is only 2 hours dinner! But we got asked to leave at 8 pm! I don't know why the nice restaurant like this one can do this to customers! Don't tell me it's because of we were two girls instead of couple. Nobody ever said only couple can dine out on Valentine's Day. There was an old men came up to us and told us rudely that there were a lot ppl waiting (I only see 4 ppl at waiting area) and they do need table asap, thus he's willing to buy us a drink the next door! Come on, who still gets mood to eat or drink anymore after u told us such things? We left 19% tips of the bill still even though we got rudely request! You guys were reservation only that day, if u can't arrange well then don't take too many reservations! It was pretty normal if the customers spent more than 3 hours on Valentine's Day dinner or any Michelin star restaurant. I have no idea why La Folie would do this to customers!

We had the three course menu, including a crab starter and lamb middle course, along with a souffle for dessert . . it all sounds delicious in theory, right? The food looked more beautiful and was presented better than it tasted. Nothing truly jumped out and grabbed me by the throat and dazzled my senses, which frankly is what I'm looking for, especially at these prices. Nothing was outstanding and sparkly, and neither was anything outrightly bad. It was just okay, with me hoping and wishing fervently that the next course would be better, and I say \"course\" tongue in cheek, because the portions were ridiculously tiny (a few bites worth), and were it not for the service, I'd be giving an extra positive star in my review. I hated the supercilious, stuffy, snotty attitude, with hardly anyone cracking a smile that actually reached their eyes. It seemed they were phoning it in and didn't give a shit, e.g. we arrived there a few minutes early, approx. 5-10 min, and were told with such an air, that we should wait next door or come back soon or . . . the air surrounding that place is chilled from the coolness of everyone there, and it has nothing to do with the temperature.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-28", "description": "If you ever go to a fancy, michelin star restaurant and you see these outrageous prices for food you hope the experience will make it worth it. Most places dazzle with decor and service while others merely blow your mind with the food. This place did both. If you eat out fancy like this often you will often notice portions are small for tasting menus and you leave the restaurant feeling not as full as you would like. You will never run into that problem here at La Folie. They feed you big portions of food and afterwards you know you got your money's worth.\n \nWe drove up to the restaurant and we wanted to find street parking, not happening. Almost impossible to find in that area so we decided to pay the $15 for valet. You can pretty much count on that to be your best option.\n \nWe were seated almost immediately at our reservation time which was nice. The restaurant is dimly lit, elegant and perfect for a dinner with your significant other. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and she felt like a princess. I told the staff it was her birthday and they did not once mention it to her, wish her happy birthday or do anything really special. I will get to that later.\n \nWe sat down and decided to get the 5 course menu which has different sections such as fish, poultry, salads, apps, dessert, etc and you choose 5 from whatever category you would like. This allowed both me and my girl to choose different things and split them so we can have nibbles of everything. They starteds us with a few amuse bouche and the first one was a salmon tartare bite which was refreshing. The second was a quail egg with fried bread or polenta to eat together. It was interesting to eat inside the egg.\n \nNext were apps, I got a sweet breads dish over salad greens and my girl got a uni and octopus salad. You think sweet breads and people freak out but if you can cook it right, it's so tender. These were cooked well and I was loving it, not a huge fan of the greens paired with it but the breads helped make up for it and the sauce was lovely. The uni and octopus salad was to die for though, it was so delicious and everything complimented the delicate seafood. Very tasty.\n \nNext I got a seared scallop with asparagus and it was a good scallop but it was a little overcooked. My girl got a dish which was fish eggs in a few different ways. Over an oyster, in a small martini glass with custard and over sashimi. It was very fresh and tasted like the ocean which is good when it comes to seafood.\n \nNext I got seafood risotto and everything about it was cooked well but the flavor just wasn't there for me. I wanted more out of it because it came under a silver dome so it was impressive looking but left something to be desired. My girl got a stuffed branzino and the fish was good but I was not a fan of the stuffing.\n \nNext were the meats. I got duck and my girl got a stuffed squab. The duck was literally the best tasting thing I had this meal. I still think about it. There was some  duck liver mouse, with this beautiful piece of duck cooked to perfection and the sauce was to die for. I want that duck so badly right now. My girl's squab was such a large portion that she had trouble finishing it. I didn't have any problem eating off her plate. It was very tasty and very good portion size. Almost a normal dinner size and I really enjoyed that.\n \nNow I mentioned it was my girl's birthday, so for dessert they put a chocolate \"happy birthday\" banner on her dessert. That was it. No mention, no saying of happy birthday to her, just that chocolate thing. I looked it up and it looks like they aren't in the business of doing anything much for special occasions. Seemed a little snobbish to me. Yes it is fine dinning but if you have customers come in for special occasions at your establishment, the least you could do is acknowledge it. I wasn't happy.\n \nShe got a souffle and it was okay, it was cheese which I didn't think was a good choice for dessert but my girl wanted it. I got a baked alaska. It was very pretty and tasted really good. We also got petite fours as a closer and they were pretty tasty as well and a good conclusion to the meal.\n \nOverall a elegant, romantic and intimate dinning experience. Some dishes were hit or miss but you got so much food coming your way you didn't notice. Generous portions and you definitely get your money worth. When I have a dish that leaves such an impact on me I can't help but give the place 5 stars but I didn't like how some dishes were overcooked and that they didn't acknowledge my girlfriends birthday except for chocolate with icing on it.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

He took me to La Folie because he had been there before and it is one of the best French places he knows.\n\nI looked over the menu and immediately had to remind myself to keep an open mind. I consider myself pretty adventurous already having eaten things like cow tongue, and chicken feet, and snails before...but I'd never been given a menu with ONLY that type of selection. The menu was a long list of course after course of foie gras, and pigs feet, and venison, and duck tongue, and sweetbread (which isn't at all what it sounds like!) and I found myself constantly asking my friend \"what is THIS? and what is THAT?\" I was excited and anxious to try so many new things all in one meal.\n\nIt turned out that a lot of things that I didn't think I would like were actually pretty delicious! I enjoyed the duck tongue, and the snails with bone marrow, and beet salad (I've never liked beets before, and it was ONLY beets in that beet salad! I was definitely pleasantly surprised!) I could've done without the cheese course, mostly because many of the cheeses we chose were much too rich of our taste. Even the soft creamy cheeses, which are generally light in flavor, had a very strong rustic taste. I had to wash it down with lots of water and alcohol. Also, the cocktail that I ordered wasn't very impressive, considering the price. They do give you plenty of alcohol in your drink though, I'll say that!\n\nAll in all, my experience was lovely. The presentation of each plate was beautiful, the servers were doting, and the atmosphere was so classy and romantic! My opinion of French food has definitely gone up a few bars. But before you come here, make sure you are willing to try new things! (Or even to RE-try things that you didn't like before) French cuisine is not for everyone, sufficed to say.

We settled on 3 courses each for $100pp. The amuse Bouche was a dungeness crab croquette with crab custard in an egg - definitely a strong fresh crab flavor but could have used a kick of spice! We started with the frog legs and snail ragout on marrow, seared foie gras on quince ($30 supplement but definitely come hungry for this generous portion), then had the lobster, pig feet and sweetbread terrine over a bed of not so tender lentils (which thankfully resembles nothing of the aforementioned main meat ingredients but comes together in a delicious disc). For our main courses, we enjoyed the rabbit trio and Liberty duck breast. For dessert, we couldn't pass up the famous Baked Alaska with the wonderful brown butter cake and speculoos crust. We finished with the petit fours on the house. We thought the Baked Alaska and frog legs and snail were two standout dishes.

Classic, inviting and romantic.  I wasn't kidding about sexy time.  Though it took some pondering as to whether to opt for the Chef's Tasting menu or create our own 5-course meals, we came up with a game plan - order unique dishes amongst the four of us including items solely available in the former to sample (literally) just about everything La Folie has to offer.\n\nPrior to first courses, amouse bouches aka \"amizz bizzles\" as I like to affectionately call them, came out to whet our appetites.  A perfectly carved egg shell housed deliciously savory vegetable bisque as well a whole yolk for choline-aceous nutrition.\n\nNext, frog legs arranged in a circle stood at one corner while Dungeness crab salad atop English pea panna cotta manned the opposite.  Besides being mad fresh, the atypical balance of cool temperature with savory gelatin was a welcome and refreshing change of pace.  My Triple T tempura duck egg squatting on a yummy sweetbread pancake, on the other hand, was a good deal warmer and seriously had the most thin and delicate batter layer I've seen yet.  For veggie lovers, a colorful salad of baby heirloom beets and radiant goat cheese tatin offered both cold and hot savory awesome.\n\nWhile I've had my share of French escargot often served drenched in butter, tasting them sauteed and served in hollowed out animal bone showed me that they can in fact have a really fresh and resilient texture.  Hard to say whether I liked this or my friend's seared day boat scallop, sauteed sweetbreads and essence of bacon (bacon vinaigrette).  No wait...there was also my lightly cooked arctic char and some beyond Godly butter poached lobster on celery root ravioli, truffle beure fondue and Marcona almonds.  While that just sounds like a list of random ingredients, I mention them because each one could be discerned on the palate and the harmony amongst them was unparalleled.\n\nCarnivores like myself perked up when lamb chops, pan seared beef tenderloin, a trio of rabbit and a duo of duck breast & duck confit came out.  While the flavors of the rabbit loin were a bit muddled, the citrus marmalade and passionfruit gastrique on the duck came together to make an amazing combination of savory and citrusy flavors.\n\nApproaching the desserts, I'm not going to lie: I squealed like a little schoolgirl upon first bite of the huckleberry baked Alaska.  Likewise, my cheese souffle came perfectly baked with some fantastic fromage blanc sorbet.\n\nBeyond the (obviously) phenomenal cuisine, our server did a spectacular throughout the entirety of our 5 hour 15 minute meal (yeah I know right?).  Personable, humorous and keenly attentive to our conversations so as to pace the dishes just right.  To top this ethereal experience all off, Chef Roland Passot came out at the end to greet all of us and personally thank each one of us for coming in.  Such an absolute class act with huge charisma amongst chefs.\n\nMy most memorable dining experience yet with the most excellent of company =)", "author": "Eric F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-30", "description": "Being from Hawaii, i have to tell you, there aren't much places to go for stellar French Cuisine besides La Mer and Le Bistro, so if there is a destination to go to for the ultimate in fine dining and a dinner that will knock my socks off and leave a lasting impression, San Francisco is the place that had the chance to, but finding that ONE restaurant that would do it would be quite a challenge considering all the options that are before me.\n\n After extensive research, and i mean extensive research all over the web,yelp, and word of mouth, it came down to Fleur De Lys,Chapeau, and La folie. It was one of the hardest decisions i have ever had to make because me and my wife were in San Francisco for just two nights after coming in from Napa Valley and one of the other nights were reserved with friends so i had to hit the bullseye on this one. \n\n But after looking at La Folie's website and menu selection, the presentation and items on the menu made me drool all over my laptop keyboard and then, and only then did i finally make the decision on La Folie for that one special dinner. And the beauty of it was making a special request for our dinner through Opentable on their website. And i have to tell you, everything that we requested for and hoped for were exceeded and then some.\n\n La Folie is a quaint and cozy French Restaurant located on 2316 Polk St near my favorite Seafood place Swan Oyster Depot is. I love the feel of this place as it is not as stuffy and stiff as i thought it would be. Our table was right by the window and it was very spacious to enjoy each other's company and conversation unlike Bouchon in Yountville where you are packed in like sardines and could literally eat the food off your neighbors table and whisper sweet nothings in their ears if you wish.\n\n What captivates is the menu selection here. They are classified in five different categories Soups&Salads, Appetizers, Fish & Shellfish, Poultry& Meat, and Dessert & Cheeses. You can choose from three different course selection for $80 dollars, four courses for $90 dollars and a five course menu for $100 dollars.\n\n There are some items that have an additional supplementation such as the Le Beouf $20 dollars more or the Golden Apple for $60 wink,wink which i came very close to ordering as well.\n\n The beauty of this menu is that you can basically create your own menu by ordering in whatever category you wish and can even order some items off the tasting items to the left of your menu as well with the exception of the Poultry&Meat selection where our server Mandy said that would be way too much and i took that into consideration since she knows best. And believe me, after dining here at La Folie, i understood what she meant wholeheartedly.\n\n From start to finish, La Folie took me to another demension of fine dining. The service was seamless from start to finish. Our server Mandy, was pleasant,knowledgable, and made me and my wife's Anniversary dining experience here one that we will both never forget. And the food throughout the evening with the exception of just one dish was just amazing and flawless. The presentation here is breathtaking and too beautiful to eat. And the portions here aren't miniscule at all. Believe me when i say this, your five course will be a ten course meal when all is said and done because of all the goodies that Chef Passot brings in between your food selections.\n\n I loved how chef cam out of the kitchen to greet us at our table.

Typically, you get the head chef's backup guy and a staff full of people that really don't want to be there after a busy weekend. At least that seemed to be the case at La Folie this Monday night. We walked in together, semi-loud and semi buzzed (one cocktail each), the life of the party...well the life of the dining area at La Folie. Our waitress had an attitude right from the get-go, about what, I'm not sure, maybe the poor girl was tired. We had no idea there was a mandatory three courses each, so the way we went about things was ordered like-so... \n\n~The Golden Apple! Yes I fell off the pescadarean / vegetarian wagon, once again...yeah yeah yeah I know, shame on me. This dish was very, very well worth it! Each bite tasted like a bite of caramel apple French toast, bursting with flavors in your mouth, titillating your senses. YUMMM. This was like dessert before dinner. SOoo Sweet! \n\n~Baby Heirloom Beets Salad, Robiola Tres Latti Mousse, Banyuls Vinaigrette: We asked to split this after we were told they were generous proportions. Lots of plump beets, soaked in too much vinegarette. I could have passed on this one. Especially because they brought it out, side by side with our next course... not even splitting the beet salad on two separate plates and allowing us to enjoy each course.\n\n~Special order: Lobster Risotto sans the Lobster. For one, I'm allergic :( For two, we wanted to take them up on their freshly sliced black truffle offer and smother our risotto in it. I must say, I could live off this for ever. Add truffles to anything and my eyes will be rolling to the back of my head!\n\n~R\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab, stuffed with Wild Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, Truffled Jus. Yes, I fell deep off the veggie eating wagon, with this one. But boy, oh boy, was it good. More truffles! I kept telling myself they were a happy quail and squab. Please let that be true. Will all the other food we indulged in, this was more than enough for two people.\n\n~Warm Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9, with Fromage Blanc Sorbet, Crispy Bacon, White Sesame Tuile. (Sans bacon). No matter what I can't do the pig. No way, they have way too much personality. The souffl\u00e9 was marvelous... Very small and came with an amazing side of sorbet that just bounces all over your mouth with flavor! Yum!\n\nWith help from George, the sweetest sommelier with a thick French accent, we accompanied our main dishes with a bottle of : \n\nClos de Vougeot Grand Cru, Jean-Claude Boisset 2003~ Amazing red with a ton of personality! Full bodied with hints of oak and plums. It paired great with the game.\n\nI am a fan of La Folie! Not as much as Miss C-Lynn or others... but enough to go back, perhaps on a different night other than a Monday. ;-)", "author": "Cassandra E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-30", "description": "It had been a while since I has such excellent French food. At a time when fusion and innovation are all the rage, it is not easy to find some conventional yet creative French cuisine. \n\nRich in flavors and heavy oriented around meat, what La Folie offers is a hearty meal and a luxury occasional treat. It not a dinner for those who constantly worry about their calorie intake. This is the very first time when I have a tasting menu at a French restaurant that I actually have to box some of my food home. And I really only ordered the 4 course menu!\n\nI adore the chef's style and his menu selection. Everything offered on menu takes an impeccable amount of afford to create. There are none of those simple quick assemble. \n\nIf you are a Foie Gras lover (and who isn't?), you MUST try their seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. I have tried a good amount of Foie Gras and it is here where I had the best seared foie gras in the US. The texture, the sauce and the combination of flavors are perfect in every way. \n\nThe Pig Feet and the Trio of Rabbit entrees made me smiled. I really felt like an elite while dining here. A lot of care were put into these dishes and the final result is exquisite. \n\nThe meat dishes seem to be slightly better than the seafood counterparts. The poached lobster and butterfish, while both decent, are not on the same level as the pig feet and rabbit. I found the butterfish slightly tough and the poached lobster a bit chewy rather than crunchy.\n\nDessert is where La Folie fell short. Ever since I had that amazing cheese souffle at La Papillon in Santa Clara, none of the souffle seems to compare. Not fair I know.\n\nI know it will be a while before I would return to La Folie but it will always be on my mind. So many restaurants to try in the city and one can only have one fancy dinner a day.", "author": "Mona W."}

The leek and truffle soup was served in an egg shell with a quail egg placed on top.  The soup was delicious, flavorful, and the ingredients complimented each other.  My only disappointment?  I only got one.\n\n*Lobster & Mushroom Risotto - DELICIOUS!  The risotto was creamy with added chopped mushrooms and asparagus.  The lobster meat was nice and sweet.  The lobster broth added a flavorful touch to the dish.  I did debate between the lobster risotto and the butter poached lobster and ultimately decided on the risotto.  My friend ordered the butter poached lobster which I got to try.  Although the risotto was good, I would recommend the butter poached lobster.  The butter poached lobster was flavorful and had a certain savoriness that's irresistible.\n\n*Roasted Emigh Farms Lamb Rack - GOOD!  The lamb rack is cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with butter beans and yummy diced pieces of chorizo that tasted similar to ham.  The dish was completed by a drizzled olive lamb jus which further brought out the lamb flavor.\n\n*\"The Sunset\" Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant - YUM!!!!  The chocolate souffl\u00e9 like cake contained melted dark chocolate which was sweet but not too sweet.  The dessert was placed on top of cr\u00e8me anglaise which tasted similar to melted vanilla ice cream.  To complete the dish, dry brandied apples, cherries, and apples were on the side.  Beware of the brandied dried fruits, they are strong!\n\nSERVICE:\nImpeccable, but that's no surprise if you've managed to flip through other reviews.  As we stepped into La Folie, we were greeted by hosts as well as servers with warm hellos.  Our waiter was nice, helpful, and knowledgeable.  He recommended me a great wine.  The servers were also great.  They were nice and explained each dish as they brought it out. \n\nPARKING:\nA bit tough if you come during the prime dining hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-22", "description": "La Folie is my first true fine dining experience, and they sure did set the standard way up there.\n\nWe called to set a reservation for 9 people, which was easy and hassle-free. Typical of most upscale restaurants, they require a credit card number for their records for big parties. The reason being is if your group decides not to show up, the credit card on hold will be charged $90 per person. Yikes! Of course, they tell you this as you make your reservation.\n\nThe place was on the smaller side with simple yet elegant decor. You get the typical white table clothed tables and dim lighting amidst hushed conversations. Our party, however, was a bit more raucous, much to the romantic couples' dismay. \n\nAnyway, being the birthday celebrant, I opted for the 4- course meal. By the way, they are pretty lax as far as mixing up the menus between the Chef's tasting menu and the regular menu. So, don't be scared. They're not very stuck up.\n\nWe began with an Amuse bouche consisting of sardines, lemon zest and some other stuff. Then, we had a poached egg with tomato bisque, potato crisp and toasted butter brioche, compliments of the chef. The presentation was quite cute as the bisque was contained inside a brown egg shell, perfectly cut on top. They also provide bread and butter. My first dish was the BRENTWOOD CORN SOUP with Maine lobster, pickled ramps and olive oil. It was a beautiful soup with the perfect consistency. It wasn't just a soup, it was liquid gold! The second course was the GOAT CHEESE TATIN with roasted eggplant, artichokes, tomato confit, portobello mushroom and sauce vi\u00e8rge. I'm a sucker for Goat cheese so this was a sure pick and winner. Just imagine all said ingredients layer by layer and that's exactly what this appetizer is. Then, the main show: TRIO OF RABBIT (loin, rack and braised leg) with spring vegetables, garlic, thyme, rosemary and natural au jus. I've never had rabbit so I wasn't quite sure what I was getting into. Rabbit is yummy; it's like a more flavorful, tender, slightly gamey chicken. The seasoning and flavors were very natural and not overpowering;  the chef really wanted to show the flavor of rabbit meat. A palate cleansing amuse bouche rolled out, which was a combination of floral, nutty and fruity flavors. My fourth and final course was the VAHLRONA CARAIBE CHOCOLATE MOUSE with beet sponge cake, lychee-white chocolate macaroon and hibiscus sorbet. If you like chocolate but not an overindulgence of it, this is the perfect dessert for you! It was amazeballs!! \n\nBeware, this is not one of those fine dining establishments where a trip to In n Out afterwards is necessary. Their portions are not stingy! A 3-course meal would've sufficed for me, but being a greedy birthday celebrant, I wanted 4! I basically took home 3/4 of my rabbit course. I suggest getting a 3-course meal minus desert as you get complimentary petit fours anyway!\n\nOur server was very proper, professional and pleasant. He made us feel VIP and didn't belittle us even though we couldn't pronounce some of the courses or was oblivious as to what amuse bouche was. He also didn't mind taking a bazillion pictures, being that we were Asian, and that's just what we do.\n\nNeedless to say, La Folie provided a wonderful, elegant birthday dinner for me!", "author": "Carmela A."}

I was not a big fan of Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy or Patina.  Gary Danko also leaned French and I did not like it as much as other highly rated restaurants.  After having dinner at La Folie, I noticed how similar all of these places are--the richness, the flavor combinations, the way meats, seafood and especially vegetables are prepared.\n\nGiven that I did not love any of these places, this cuisine and style of cooking might not be the best fit for me.  I would say I liked La Folie about the same as Gary Danko--a few bright spots here and there but just too many okay courses to make me want to return.  I would give La Folie the slight edge though.\n\nMy favorite course was easily the butter poached lobster.  Even though the lobster was not as soft as what I have had at fine dining restaurants like Sona, Providence and The French Laundry, it was moist, fresh and had a good flavor.  The pasta on the raviolo was too soft (though I think that is just the case with raviolo), but the pumpkin filing was great (I did wish there was more pumpkin filling).  The garnish of black truffles was very good--distinct flavor and fragrance.\n\nThe dungeness salad with cauliflower panna cotta was also good.  The panna cotta was very creamy while the crab was moist and fresh (very big pieces like king crab).  I also liked the bright and tart vinaigrette as well as the caviar (a small portion but a great punch of briny, salty and strong fish flavor).\n\nSeafood, for the most part, was nicely done here.  The amuse lollipop of smoked salmon, mascarpone cheese and caviar was good and fun.\n\nThe scallop dish was okay.  The scallop was moist and soft, but there was not much of a sear.  The lemongrass coconut broth was very smooth and had a strong lemongrass flavor.  Even though the coconut flavor was not strong, the flavor was very inviting.  The garnish of kabocha squash was good.\n\nI did not like the main meat course of venison.  The venison had a good color and was tender, but it did not have a good flavor.  The meat itself was moist, but it had kind of a dry flavor (maybe it was due to how the meat was seasoned).  The sweet and sour red cabbage along with the peppery juniper berries made the dish too tart.  The assorted vegetables were like glazed vegetables.  I have never enjoyed this preparation of vegetables because I prefer more contrast in textures when it comes to vegetables.\n\nDessert was also not that great.  It was a baked Alaska and despite the many fruit elements (huckleberry muffin, huckleberry ice cream, lemon verbena ice cream), the filling was not too tart.  The meringue shell was fine, but it was all shell and had no creaminess or fluffiness.  I have had baked Alaska with more contrasting textures in the meringue though I am not sure if the harder shell is really more authentic to the traditional recipe.  This dessert also came with a very tart lemon bar.\n\nService was fine.  For the most part, the food came out at a good pace.  There were a few noticeable gaps between some courses.  The staff was pleasant though they seemed to be a little hectic (dropping things and such); it didn't bother me, but I imagine it would bother some.\n\nLike Gary Danko, prices were reasonable for fine dining given the variety of expensive ingredients used and the generous portions.\n\nI liked La Folie's small dining room.  It was reminiscent of Gary Danko in terms of color scheme, but La Folie's dining room felt more contemporary.\n\nI think if you are a big fan of French cuisine, La Folie might be one worth considering.  If you are not a fan, you may want to skip La Folie.  I much prefer restaurants like Manresa or The French Laundry, which are fine dining spots that utilize French techniques but serve far more contemporary and lighter fare.\n\nFor a place that leans more French, I would recommend Keiko a Nob Hill over La Folie; Keiko a Nob Hill is very much a French restaurant, but their light and contemporary food really separates it from traditional and (for me) old-fashioned fine dining French restaurants.\n\nStreet parking might be hard to find in this area.  La Folie offers valet parking.", "author": "Anthony N."}

The food completely exceeded my expectations which were already high. The service was impeccable - friendly and helpful but not overbearing. The ambiance was lovely, we sat in the back room with high ceilings and beautiful decor that made you feel like royalty. The food was absolutely delicious, interesting, and perfectly prepared.\n\nAmuse Bouche #1: Foie gras mousse (Soft and delicious)\n\nAmuse Bouche #2: Avocado, uni, and cucumber in an egg shell (Very interesting flavors working together so well)\n\nTriple-T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg: \nRecommended by our waitor, it's similar to a soft boiled egg surrounded by truffled custard, mushrooms, braised chicories, and truffle vinaigrette. This was so yummy and different and the truffle taste was perfection. Even a bit of fresh shaved truffle on top.\n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras:\nHoly mother of all food! The chef is known for his seared foie gras and I know why. it's made with wild huckleberries (which I love as I'm an Idaho girl and they are prominent there) and aged balsamic vinegar. It was melt in your mouth delicious that you did not want to end. It's a huge portion that is easily shareable. I will crave this from now on.\n\nSeared Day Boat Scallop:\nPrepared with charred leeks, crispy guanciale (which is like a bacon), and roasted potato foam. I loved this, especially the charred leeks.\n\nLobster and Mushroom Risotto:\nPrepared with leeks and mushroom broth. Wow, this was unbelievable! The portion of lobster was very big and unexpected for most fancy restaurants. The risotto was perfectly al dente and flavorful. \n\nCertified Black Angus Beef Tenderloin:\nPrepared with bearnaise croquette, bone marrow custard on top, and a truffled madeira sauce. This was perfectly cooked and tender and flavors worked together so well.\n\nEdam Cheese Souffle:\nWith fromage blanc sorbet, crispy bacon, and sesame tuile which is like a lightly sweet cracker on top.

Almost like a slightly sweet cheesy creme brulee but better.\n\nThis is food heaven and a very special culinary experience. From the truffles, to the foie gras, to the lobster, to the beef tenderloin. My husband and I said we felt like our toes were hurting from developing gout from this decadent food. :) I have every intention of coming back for more!", "author": "Laura A."}

Talk about bad timing with trying foie gras for the first time! I have to say, this was the best place to have it for the first and last time, at least in California.\n\nI really appreciate great service and I have yet to have a bad experience at La Folie. I like that their timing is perfect with each dish so that you can savor each one. Each dish that comes out puts a smile on my face. It's almost magical. \n\nI love that the entire menu is available for you to create your own meal. \n\nThe butter poached lobster is one of my faves. The celery root raviolo is amazing.

We both ordered the 4 course meal but I thought they would scale back the food portions. For the money, it's totally worth it, but for my stomach, I only have one and it is a finite amount of space. When we went to Gary Danko, they scaled back based on how many courses you order.\n\nWe both had the parsnip soup, which was supposed to have black truffles in there. However, it was hard to taste the black truffles and I really only tasted the chanterelle mushrooms. The soup was delicious anyway.  I had the poached john dory and it was delicious but felt slightly overcooked since it was a little bit rubbery. It still had excellent flavors paired with the vermouth herb sauce. For the third course, I had the duck breast and by then, my stomach was about to explode so it was hard to enjoy this dish. Again, I was able to lick the plate clean. The beet sauce paired quite nicely with the duck and offered a nice sweet complement to the savory duck.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the chocolate ganache.  It was very rich yet delicate. Oh yes, in between we had palate cleansers as well. \n\nThe ambiance was not what I expected for such a nice restaurant. The table next to use were all on their phones. Another couple was on their phone texting. People took calls on their cell phones. Seriously, the staff didn't say anything but we thought it was annoying and rude.", "author": "Elena R."}

I've been warned about their portions, so definitely made an educated decision going with three courses ($80 base).  Little did I know it would come with so many additional dishes, compliments of the chef.  All in all, I had eight different plates.  I finished 7.2.  Not bad considering...\n\nMy first course was the warm pig feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine, on a lentil salad with bacon and hazelnut vinaigrette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=NGiQDhiwdSz_KxKmRrNTuA#0aUyWBJcGh_aB_zxwCRljg).  My goodness, this dish was rich.  And after two amuse bouches, I knew I was in too deep.\n\nCourse two was the butter poached lobster, on musquee de provence ravioli with truffle beurre fondue, and spiced pepita salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=NGiQDhiwdSz_KxKmRrNTuA#_RUdxhPflrCkLX4qAP8fpQ).  My favorite part of the meal.  The presentation was amazing, and so was the taste!\n\nBut I knew I couldn't touch much of dish three: a roti of quail and squab, stuffed with mushrooms, wrapped in crispy potato strings, topped with truffled jus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=NGiQDhiwdSz_KxKmRrNTuA#LSwvHPm4NEC1LKhbtBxk9Q).  Don't make a mistake like I did.  Try to order less heavy stuff for earlier courses.  This it the chef's signature dish.  I had a few bites of each and had to pack the rest.  At least the BF enjoyed it the next day.  Thoroughly.\n\nThe birthday plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=NGiQDhiwdSz_KxKmRrNTuA#NGiQDhiwdSz_KxKmRrNTuA) was simple and delicious.

This place must have changed the management because it has gone to extreme downhill. The food was cold, very late, service was extremely bad, and the price was expensive. They also forgot to give any candy at the end. The place was loud and all the people around were badly dressed. There is no class, just useless show off.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-24", "description": "The dining room is surprisingly small and seats only around 30 people. The environment is very romantic, with candlelight and white table clothes. The table for two is a tad large to be considered \"intimate\", but that leaves plenty of space for the various glassware and plates. I liked that the tables were not tightly packed so there's a semblance of privacy. \n\nOur waiter was business-like and didn't try to make small talk, not that I mind since I didn't want to chat for five minutes while I itch to dig into my food. The overall service was impeccable. The servers always walk to the other side of the table instead of reaching across to place new silverware or fill our waters. Even the guy that hands out the bread makes sure to put the bread right-side up with the seam on top. That type of attention to detail is certainly admirable and enhances the dining experience.\n\nThe restaurant allows patrons to build their own tasting menus from the entire menu. Many places only have two choices for each course on the prix fixe menu and won't let the diners substitute from the a la cart list. With La Folie, there are no throw-away courses. After some discussion, Orin and I decided to go with a 4 and 5 course tasting menu, each getting our own soup & salad, appetizer, fish & shell fish, and poultry & meat courses while sharing one dessert. \n\nWe received two amuse bouche courses. The first was a black pepper meringue with squash puree. The second was a quail egg poached in cream inside a chicken egg shell and topped with a potato crisp. Both were excellent and promised a great dinner to come.\n\nFor our first course, we picked a play on Scotch eggs and a deconstructed Dungeness crab salad. The first dish consisted of a Triple T Ranch tempura duck egg on a sweetbreads pancake, Frangelico almond pesto, and wild mushroom salad with truffle vinaigrette. The dish was fantastic. The crab salad was my favorite dish of the night. The crab meat sat on a cauliflower panna cotta, topped with a yellow curry tuile and the plate was dotted with curried spiced crab vinaigrette and bits of black caviar. The course was absolute perfection.\n\nFor the appetizer round, we shared the Hudson Valley foie gras torchon and the pig feet, lobster & sweetbread terrine. The foie was accompanied with smoked apple barbeque glazed squab, blood orange marmalade, brioche puff, fruit and nut bar and a cheese tuile. It was rather bland. Next time, I'll make sure to order the seared foie instead. The pig feet, lobster & sweetbread dish was served with a lentil salad with bacon and hazelnut vinaigrette. The dish is probably a bit adventurous for some, but it was my by boyfriend's favorite. If a white boy likes this, everyone should give it a try.\n\nOrin had the seared wild black cod and I the lobster and mushroom risotto. The cod came with a ragout of Brussel sprouts and black trumpet mushrooms, truffle gnocchi and brown butter sage caper sauce. The cod was impeccable and the truffle gnocchis gave the dish even more oomph. The risotto was served with leeks, lobster broth and fried baby sage leaves. I thought it was a bit salty and the rice need a bit more cooking. I didn't love the dish.\n\nWe picked the duck and the lamb. The duck was served three ways: liberty farm duck breast, smoked duck tongue, duck leg stuffed with duck p\u00e2t\u00e9, turnip, squash panna cotta and cranberry orange sauce. The duck was perfectly executed (you died for a good cause, Donald). The lamb was also done three ways -- we have a rack of lamb, lamb tongue, and lamb sausage wrapped in spinach leaves. The accompaniments were butter beans with chorizo and a taggiasca olive lamb jus. I was glad to have my boyfriend with me so I got to try both. I love both dishes equally.\n\nWe got a palate cleanser -- a small shot of La Folie's house-made citrus soda, with a blood orange segment on the bottom. Our dessert was the baked Alaska with huckleberry and basil ice cream, a lemon biscuit and huckleberry panna cotta on the side. It was my first baked Alaska and I enjoyed it. A good light dessert to finish off the meal.\n\nAt the close of the meal, our waiter brought us a few petite fours compliments of the kitchen. They were nice enough to pack it to-go for us because we were so stuffed. \n\nLa Folie is, without a doubt, the finest meal that I've had to pleasure to enjoy in the city. Everything about it was exemplary. The servers were well trained and were prompt and unobtrusive. The atmosphere was romantic and the noise level perfect for an intimate meal. The food, of course, was almost beyond reproach, even for a picky eater such as myself. The presentation of our courses was artful and a feast for the eyes. I certainly hope to be back here in the future for many special occasions to come!", "author": "Alice W."}

He deserves 5 stars for his efforts. \n\nOur dining experience began with us being seated in the back room. Painted in purple and green with bright lights and upbeat music, I almost expected court jesters to serve our meal and beads to be thrown at us at some point. While I understand the mardi gras/French connection, I do not understand why this room exists at an upscale, Michelin-star rated restaurant. I don't think I'm alone in the assumption that most people choosing to dine at a place like this are hoping for an intimate, romantic atmosphere. \n\nI felt like we were misled by the menu. We were told it was a 5-course pre-fixe menu. It was actually 4 courses with an amuse bouche (servers should not present a dish saying 'compliments of the chef' if it is actually being considered one of the  courses). Portion sizes were good. All of the food was decent, but we both agreed we've had better meals recently. I had the beef tenderloin, which was cooked perfectly and the truffled madeira sauce was delicious. He had the duck, which we both thought was just average. \n\nThe stand out dish by far was the seared foie gras. It was absolutely incredible. The foie gras soup was also quite good, but I'll be dreaming about and salivating over the seared portion for weeks. \n\nI'd consider giving this place another shot on a normal day when the prices aren't inflated and the dining experience doesn't feel rushed. And I'll insist on a table in the main room.", "author": "Vanessa I."}

We arrived a few minutes early for our 9:00pm reservation and were told we would have to wait a little bit and were told to find a seat in the La Folie Lounge next door. Given that we figured it would only be a few minutes since we were early, the lounge wasn't exactly inviting being so dim and loud, and the pleasant weather that evening, we decided to simply wait outside. Unfortunately it was a full 20 minutes before we were grabbed by the hostess. Not a great way to start the night but understandable and forgivable since everything improved from there.\n\n[Food]\nThe menu just screams french (obviously). Given that their pricing scheme, I knew going in that it would be financially irresponsible of my to not go for a full 5 courses - really had no choice. Even though I was thoroughly stuffed by the start of the 4th course, I still had no regrets and even applauded my own decision to make my last course a dessert course instead of doing 5 savory courses. I will say it was probably a mistake to get the heaviest dishes on their menu - the tempura duck egg, the snails, the pig feet terrine, a fillet, and the cheese souffle. My favorite dish of the night were the snails, but the accompaniments of the fillet (bone marrow custard and bearnaise croquet) were amazing as well - I hope to come back eventually and have those same sides with the Wagyu supplement.\n\nI was too busy breathing heavily and trying to subtly loosen my belt to try much of my gf's courses, which were all a lot lighter, especially since she didn't appear to be sweating and breathing heavily at the end of the meal as I was even though we both got 5 courses, but I'm told that she thought they were amazing as well.\n\n[Service]\nService was spot on for this category of restaurant. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of both the menu and the wine. Our table was always brushed clean and our napkins always neatly folded on return from the bathroom (on a few occasions, you can sort of tell that someone has seen you getting up to go from the bathroom and immediately walks to your seat to fold your napkin).\n\n[Ambiance]\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous, but small. We were seated in the back room, which was weird in that the volume would alternate between way too loud and absurdly quiet since it was just a small space that if a few parties happened to have either a peak or lull in conversation the whole volume of the room would change noticeably. Wasn't a major issue for us since we were in a pretty late seating and the room was a steady half empty for most of the meal. There's only a single bathroom in the place so there was almost always a wait the times I went, but I didn't mind. From just outside of the bathroom you can look right into the closet-sized kitchen, which is a wonderful way to spend your wait.\n\nI'd definitely mark La Folie as a restaurant worth visiting, although I'm not sure I would visit again until I've marked some of the other great restaurants in SF off of my list. That being said, it's not at all that difficult to get a late reservation through open table so it's a nice option to have for a spontaneous date night.", "author": "Ben T."}

I did like the piece of lobster and the sauce though. I'd give it a 3. My bf and I both had the John Dori.\n\nDuck was in two prepartion, breast and braise, and I prefer the braise more as it melts in the mouth. The breast was a bit bland and wasn't what I expected. I give it a 2.5\n\nLobster Risotto was probably the richest, buttery, and delicious dish my bf had. It was really well prepared as it had pack full of flavor in each bite. I would give it a 4.5.\n\nI had the quail and squab and I was overwhelmed with the amount of food. The potato wrapped around it was quite crunchy and delicious, but the entire dish was on the saltier side. Though I liked the quail, it wasn't the best quail I ever had. I wasn't the fan of the squab as it was a bit chewy. I'd give this one a 3. It's quite a big dish.\n\nI had the ink squid/uni spaghetti, and that was my best dish. I loved the ink squid, but was a bit disappointed because I didn't get the full uni fusion, though I did like the uni on top of the dish. I'd give this a 4.\n\nCheese souffle was not what I expected. It's so small! I like the sorbet/ice cream that came with it because the cheese was too heavy. I think this is why the dessert was so small. Opt for the chocolate if you want something bigger. I'd give this one a 2.5.\n\nThe bread was eh, I could care less. The service was on par with the water pouring. They do have coat hanging and give you a # tag. \n\nThe restroom is a unisex one stall restroom. The entire atmosphere was alright. It does have a lounge/bar next door, but the restaurant for dining is quite small. Reservations with a credit card need to be made in advance. \n\nIn addition, you do get a few small amuse bouche. One was tapanade, it was packed with flavor and the other one was a smoked salmon lollipop and that was a bit bland. The yogurt spoon wasn't bad as it was nice and tangy and sweet with the nuts. We also got this yolk soup, that was rich and well balanced with the salt and sweetness from the yolk. After dinner we received petite 4, half of them were good. \n\nThe chef greeted everyone towards the end of the night and thought that was nice. THe host wasn't too friendly, but was alright.\n\nWould I come back? Probably not, nice to try once. A place for proposal? Not really, more like a place to have dinner.

I've always wanted to try a Michelin star restaurant.\n\n...And what better opportunity to do so than a meal I don't have to pay for!\n\nAll in all, this meal was, without a doubt, a life-changing experience for me, and let me tell you why.\n\nFirst, the restaurant itself had a cozy atmosphere. Small and intimate, yet still spacious enough so we weren't going elbow to elbow with the tables next to us. I also enjoyed the warm lighting, unlike places that are so dim (for \"ambiance\") that you can't even read the menu without a flashlight.\n\nSecond, the service was impeccable. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable, constantly refilling our water the moment it was low in our glasses and answering any questions we had about anything on the menu. They prepped our table for each dish and cleared up each dish in a timely manner.\n\nThird, the food was was a journey I've never traveled. So many combinations of flavors, textures, and ingredients I've never experienced. Here's a short summary of the foods that we tasted. I ordered from the Winter Tasting Menu and he ordered 5 courses from the regular menu to share.\n\nFrom the tasting menu:\nThe Amuse Bouche- The first was a Mackerel on a potato chip with a sort of avocado puree. The second was what seemed liked a potato mousse inside of an egg. Amazing.\n\n\"Raviolo\" of Celery Root, Dolcini's Farm EggYolk- The earthy celery root went will with the veal jus and the matsutake mushrooms were a wonderful first for me.\n\nButter Poached Lobster- The best lobster I've ever eaten. Cooked to perfection with a sage brown butter sauce topped with truffle flakes? You really can't go wrong. The cauliflower and brussel sprout leaves were great too.\n\nRoasted Guinea Fowl- I've never had guinea fowl before, but the taste almost reminded me of Chinese roasted pig with a crisp outer skin and tender, flavorful meat. It was cooked three different, and excellent ways and went well with the truffle madeira sauce.\n\nPennyroyal Boont Corners Reserve Tomme- The cheese, honeycomb, and fruit compote complemented the walnut bread slices perfectly. Best toasted walnuts I've ever had as well.\n\n\"The Truffle\"- I've never had any dessert like it before. The roasted white chocolate ganache was to die for. The chestnut sponge cake was moist and flavorful. Finally, the truffle ice cream with squid ink, a combination I would have never imagine in a dessert, was one of a kind.\n\nFrom the regular menu:\nSauteed Burgundy Snails- The snails were cooked to perfect consistency and absorbed the flavorful goodness of the lemon butter and marrow. Dipping them in the surrounding parsley foam was refreshing and kept the fish from being too heavy.\n\nTriple-T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg- How they managed to make a tempura egg while keeping it soft-boiled ceases to amaze me, but it was great! The truffle custard and wild mushrooms were also amazing.\n\nPan Seared Branzino- This Mediterranean sea bass is definitely not your average sea bass, and the caper-brown butter sauce complemented well with the fish. The butternut squash and roasted salsify was delish with the sunchoke puree!\n\nR\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab- First time having quail prepared this way, but wrapping it with potato strings and stuffing it with mushrooms was genius! The truffled jus really brought the whole dish together.\n\nHuckleberry Baked Alaska- Finally got to try a Baked Alaska and it was great! The meringue perfectly browned on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Definitely went well with the huckleberry and lemon-thyme ice creams and lemon chiffon cake filling. The lemon-thyme parfait with huckleberry sauce on the side was perfect!\n\nI was happily surprised that the portions here were generous. We came out of this 3-hour meal more than satisfied with every aspect our experience. Now that I've experienced my first Michelin star restaurant, it's a slippery slope from which I probably won't want to escape. But I'm glad La Folie was my first big step into this delectable downward spiral into culinary excellence.", "author": "Derick N."}

One 5-course tasting menu & a separate 5-course meal la carte menu:\n\n- Amuse Bouche 1/ Cucumber Creme Fraiche, Seared Tuna, American Sturgeon Caviar, Purple Crispy Potatoes\nA \"one bite\" affair, unfortunately containing American sturgeon caviar, aka shark slurry. As I attempted to suppress this overwhelming detail, I could faintly appreciate the light cucumber creme & seared tuna. All so fast, and oh so wrong. \n\n- Amuse Bouche 2/ Organic Egg Yolk, Roasted Tomato Soup, Potato Chip, Toasted Brioche\nFirst bite, potato chip. You've got my attention. Long, superbly fresh chive. But, oh dear reader, when mine tongue tasteth that organic egg yolk in the light, creamy, and airy tomato broth, mine soul was transformed!\n\n- Frog Legs \"Bernard Loiseau\" Garlic Puree and Parsley Coulis\nFrog legs were slightly tough w/ no fat (aka flavor). Battering/deep frying didn't help. Unidentifiable amazing white stuff in the middle--almost like tangy panna cotta. Two yummy & light sauces--too bad I had to dip frog legs in them.\n\n- Saut\u00e9ed Burgundy Snails, in Pernod Lemon Butter, Parsley, Bone Marrow Gratin\nSnails buried in a leg bone, scoop out and mix with the parsley bubbles. Cool idea, but no marrow flavor, & bubbles that disappeared along with the flavor. Snails had texture of mussels, decent but unremarkably flavored--mixed with some sloppy & unappetizing half-ground-up greens. \n\n- Triple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg, on Sweetbreads Pancake, Frangelico Almond Pesto, Wild Mushroom Salad, Truffle Vinaigrette\nDuck eggs: fun concept, but thicker & less flavorful than chicken eggs. Dusted with meh crumbs. The pancake didn't taste like sweetbreads, just mild and unmemorable. Was there almond pesto? Unremarkable salad.\n\n- Butter Poached Lobster, Wild Nettle Ravioli with Truffle Beurre Fondue, Wild Arugula Salad and Marcona Almonds\nEasily the strongest dish--the brown butter sauce saturated every morsel on the plate, righteously so. Succulent & slightly chewy lobster was a fresh taste of the sea, creamy truffles were a hint of earth--the bitter & tangy arugula and crunchy almonds provided a full equilibrium. Worth it for this dish alone. \n\n- Seared Day Boat Scallop and Saut\u00e9ed Sweetbreads, Wild Mushrooms, Almond Pistou, Truffle Bacon Vinaigrette\nEvery aspect poorly planned--never been disappointed by scallops until now (not soft & creamy, but chewy & bland), sweetbreads had overpowering innards flavor, freezer-bag-quality veggies served in unsavory, goopy brown sauce. \n\n- Liberty Farm Duck Breast and Crispy Duck Confit Gateau, Fresh Peach, Haricot Vert\nSoft, tender, & flavorful duck meat. Delicious confit, but what's not to love about any creature cooked in its own fat? Unidentified mediocre veggies on the side topped with a slice of the most delicious & juicy peach I've ever consumed. More brown sauce goo, totally unnecessary and marring to the dish. \n\n- R\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab Stuffed with Wild Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, Truffled Jus\nCredit for beautiful presentation & creativity, but the overall mediocre--perhaps because I was already full. Quail & squab are novelties but would lose to the standards in a blind taste test. The potato strings were a nice touch. The egg yolk basket was a cute idea, but the yolk itself was not runny and not firm, and not flavorful. Mediocre veggies. Death to brown sauce!\n\n- Beaufort d'Alpage--This raw cow's milk cheese has a dense buttery texture, and deep flavors of nuts and hay. Served with French Baguette and Honeycomb\nNothing special here--half-dry boring cheese. Bland & uncreative salad. Nice concept to dip in honeycomb, but this was no artisan honey. \n\n- Rosemary Honey Caviar, Candied Walnuts, Plum Helene, Orange Sorbet\nHoney caviar & sorbet? Sounds cool, right? Wrong. They must've been like, \"What do we have left in the fridge? Some old caviar. Oh, and there's some leftover sorbet. Oh, and there's a half-eaten bag of walnuts in the pantry. Hey, let's throw it all together and call it a haute palette cleanser!\"\n\n- Summer Berries, Raspberry-Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake, Strawberry Ice Cream, Olive Oil Powder\nThe berries were mildly sour and the peanut butter chocolate cake was literally one bite. Olive oil powder is a better idea on paper than in practice. Nothing noteworthy here.\n\n- Peach Melba Baked Alaska, Peach Ice Cream, Earl Grey Tea Pound Cake, Raspberry Sauce, Earl Grey Tea Mousse\nMy 1st traditional Baked Alaska w/ meringue exterior. Well executed, & while I've had bad experiences with peach ice cream and was expecting the same here, it was just delicious. Earl Grey mousse and pound cake was unbelievable. One of the best desserts I've ever had.\n\n- Petit Fours\nOne yummy hazelnut chocolate square, and three non-chocolate mediocre ones. \n\nAll in all:\n\nSeveral fantastic dishes that made for an enjoyable experience, but where much is given, much is required, & La Folie's delivery was not consistent enough to earn a special designation.", "author": "Elliott D."}

It was more money than we had ever spent on a meal in our entire lives. Due to a personal emergency, we didn't even get to stay for the dessert we had already paid for. And yet, it was so worth it. It was far and away the best part of my week long trip to San Francisco.\n\nThere's no point in detailing the specific menu items that were available the evening we were there. And there's no way to describe how delicious each and every bite was. I'll provide one anecdote as an illustration: At one point, my husband commented that my entire face lights up whenever I try something I truly love. If I eat 20 meals at 20 different restaurants, I'm lucky if I reach this nirvana once with one dish. At La Folie, not just every dish but every single bite had this effect on me. \n\nOne thing you may find helpful... Most of the customers were dressed to the nines. Suits for the men and cocktail dresses and heels for the ladies. I wore a simple black maxi dress and some comfortable black flip flops; mike had a shirt and jacket but no tie over some quite nice grey jeans. While this establishment was clearly intended to be a little dressier, we never felt like we didn't belong . I can't tell you how wonderful every single worker was.

Theirs was a trio of roe, all different flavors (vanilla, brandy, etc), but I really couldn't taste the difference.\n\nThe lobster was amazing.  The cod was amazingly tender, probably the best fish I've ever had.  The duck came cooked several different ways.  The breast was perfectly done with a little bit of crispy skin.  There was even duck tongue!  \n\nThe cheese souffle was okay.  I think I prefer a sweet over savory in this case.\n\nThe most amazing thing was actually an amuse bouche.  It's basically an egg shell with soup broth with an egg yolk.  When you stir it, you break the yolk, and you get this really rich, creamy delicious \"soup\".\n\nThe service was world class.

I remember hearing him say two things about it that left an indelible impression: \n\n1)  that it was consistently among the top places to eat in SF. \n\n2)  that it was the most requested restaurant destination in his cab for big spenders. \n\nFast forward to 2016 when I finally,FINALLY stepped foot into La Folie.  The reservations were super easy and user-friendly via OpenTable (one must reserve with a CC to prevent the no-show factor).  I met my gal pal M, flown in fresh from NYC.  We both ordered the full tasting menu. Each and every course was a masterpiece.  My favorite course was the rib-eye, owing to my unrelenting and tenacious carnivorous ways. M's favorite part was the real honeycomb imported from Sonoma County, part the cheese and brioche course. The only thing that was off point was the 'Gatsby' mocktail which was unremarkable and watered down--wouldn't recommend it.  The service was truly impeccable by the best trained staff in the West.  Our server, was especially knowledgeable with food of origin details and the respective regions of grape for the wine pairings. La Folie serves up sophistication in taste, food combination, wines, and service....and the most beautiful thing about it is that it's neither stuffy nor pretentious. La Folie is beautiful all 'round. Thank you! I needed that!", "author": "Baby J."}

Our server, Iva, was fantastic - friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcomed.  I would put it right up there with Gary Danko for city dining.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nI had a four course meal:\n- Asparagus Soup - warm soup was poured over a dish with lobster meat, mushrooms and a few other goodies.  Overall pretty good, although I would have preferred if there was a little more salt in the soup\n- Day Boat Scallop with Sauteed Sweetbreads - this dish was very well-made.  I really enjoyed the scallop, which was probably what you would refer to as medium -rare\n- Lamp Chop - Pretty good, although not the best that I've had.  I preferred the duck breast that my husband got\n- The Sunset - the chocolate cake was very good, although the brandied dried fruit had too much brandied soaked in.  They didn't add much to the dish for me.\n\nMy husband did the five course meal:\n- Triple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg - The duck egg was so nicely cooked - gooey on the inside, but with the fried batter on the outside.  Yum.  The catch is I really do not like truffles (gasp), and there was truffle flavor all over this dish.\n- Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine - a surprisingly good dish!  The pig's feet was very tender. The portion is very large as well.\n- Chef's Special - a nice secret special, which was a generous portion and SO good.\n- Poached Lobster - this lobster was probably poached in butter!  It was very good - loved it.\n- Duck Breast and Crispy Duck Confit Gateau - although my lam was good, this was better.  I love game-y meats, and this was suitable to my taste buds.  I wasn't fond of the confit (never am), but the duck breast was perfect.  I'll be ordering this next time if they have it.\n\nThis is definitely a place I'll visit again.", "author": "Tracy L."}

But I learn that it has been totally redone with a nice lounge which I plan to visit sometime in the future. As usual, we ordered all our dishes with the intent to share all of them equally. We debated getting the 1/2 oz caviar but did not. The only reason I mention it is because I hear that it is great (if that is your sort of thing.) That said, here is what we had with our comments.\n  - Frog Legs \"Bernard Loiseau\". I've loved frog for years; wish the served the whole thing. Who si Bernard?\n  - Dungeness Crab Salad. Yum. You can't go wrong here with this.\n  - Tasting of Passot Roe. I don't suggest this if you have access to a favorite Japanese restaurant, but if not, then hey, try it, it's super fresh, quality and extremely good.\n  - Tempura Duck Egg, on Sweetbreads Pancake. If you want some duck egg, try this, but it wasn't our favorite dish of the night, but still cooked well.\n  - Lobster, on Musquee de Provence Ravioli. Beautiful, get it.\n  - Beef Tenderloin with Bearnaise Croquette (perfectly cooked, we couldn't eat so I took it home and it was just as good cold.\n  - Duck Breast and Crispy Confit Croquette. Perfectly cooked, very tender, some fat, but not fatty. Get this, it will be some of the best in SF.\n  - Baked Alaska. Oh yeah. No further comment needed.\n\nI hope to go back to this great SF spot.

We had planned a little get away for ourselves and after reviewing many options in SF we chose La Folie for our dinner reservation.  The dinner started out well.  We got the 5 course menu. Two amuse bouches to begin then the meal went down hill quickly from there.  \n\nNegatives - The Beet Salad was something I would expect from hotel room service. The Goat Cheese Tatin looked like something from the circus - circa 1983 plating/presentation.  The Black Cod had an extremely fishy odor we were afraid to eat it.  Desserts were poor as well.  I had the Apple Tarte Tatin which, apart from the rum raisin ice cream had no flavor.  my wife had the Huckleberry Baked Alaska. First time I ever needed a chainsaw to cut through a baked alaska...even the sponge cake was frozen. Perhaps the most disappointing was the cheese course (the only reason my wife added a fifth course was for this course).  No table side presentation, the options were extremely limited.  The \"brie\" option was a local CA product with NO flavor. The Epoisses was good, but not the \"king of cheese\" and the promised piece of honeycomb that is served with it was negligible.\n\nI would normally ask if the Chef was there - I might have been willing to give them a pass if Chef had the night off on a holiday weekend. No -  he was there walking around the restaurant.  The sommelier never even came to the table to discuss wine options or pairings. Our server never even told us his name/introduced himself properly. \n\nThe Positives - The beef filet was really well prepared and tasty.  The Snails may have been my favorite thing I ate that evening. The Lobster Risotto w/ White Truffles was stellar.  The portions were sized appropriate - they did not leave you craving more  food when your meal was complete.  \n\nOverall, three quality courses from a combined ten courses in not what I expect from a Michelin Star restaurant.", "author": "Alex V."}

Although everything was good and cooked perfectly, not one dish wow'd me.\n\nThere was also a slight issue I have with the way they do things. I saw the two tables next to us get all the amuse bouches we got plus an additional salmon lollipop that we didn't get. At first I thought maybe we were going to get it later in our meal but when desserts came out, I knew we were not going to get it. I asked our server why we didn't get the salmon lollipops and he told me that the Chef only gives it to his friends and regulars. Later on the Chef came out to each table and greeted everyone. The way he greeted his \"friends\" was the same way he greeted us (quick hello, how's everything and please come again). So I doubt they really are his friends. So I don't know what's really going on but either way it's poor taste on their part. We all are paying customers, we should all be treated the same. \n\nIf you decide to go even after reading my review, here are two tips for you:\n1. Ask to be seated in the front dining room. The back room is dark, old looking and stuffy.\n2. If you don't get the salmon lollipops, ask for them.\n\nValet is $15 and you may need it given that street parking sucks.\nWhen they bring out the mignardise (basically the little sweets and goodies they give you at the end), they do add a candle to it if you are celebrating a birthday.\n\nIn my opinion, Gary Danko's would have been a better choice. The food and service is way better and prices are a bit lower. And if you are celebrating a birthday, they even give you a free dessert on top of the mignardise and on top of any dessert you order.", "author": "Andy W."}

The ambiance is intimate and peaceful, and the service outstanding. While the food is of course pricey, it's certainly deserving of that Michelin star. We ordered the lobster, duck, frog legs, escargot, and wagyu beef, among others, and found every dish both finely plated/presented and incredibly flavorful. Unlike other French restaurants, moreover, they were able to accommodate all of our dietary restrictions, and had plenty of veggie and even dairy-free options. \n\nMy only comment is that you definitely get more \"bang for your buck\" out of certain dishes. I'd recommend going with the seafood and meat options over the salads, which appeared to be much smaller, portion-wise.\n\nIf you're looking for a quaint restaurant to celebrate an anniversary or a special event, consider La Folie.

We decided on the four course menu and let me tell you, their courses are generous! I think three courses would've been enough, but having four means more choices. \n\nWhat's great about their menu is that you can choose your 3, 4 or 5 courses from any section of their menu. You can have 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 desert or no appetizer, 2 seafoods, 1 meat, 2 desserts or all entrees if that's what you want! Get my point? It's a pretty awesome option to have.\n\nService was great and they gave us the cute window seat per our request.  While it is a splurge, you go home feeling satisfied, full, and happy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-11", "description": "Definitely on the top on my list in terms of french food and fine dining. I'm a foodie and  although I'm not rich, I'm willing to pay a lot for good food.  I'm often treated differently at restaurants like this because the servers are skeptical that a person my age/stature can afford it.  The servers at this place were different, they were down to earth and spoke much louder, with more robustness and energy than at other fine dining places.  I felt comfortable here, unlike other restaurants where I had to worry about speaking too loud, improper etiquette, etc...which made my dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nThis is also the first time I left a french restaurant with a take out box!  We were full before we even got to the desserts! Although the portions weren't huge, because there were so many courses and amuse bouche, the rich flavors really filled us up.  \n\nMy first impression: small, simple, elegant and clean.  I loved the fresh flowers bouquets behind the bar... gorgeous.  I already knew what I wanted even before going to the restaurant because their spring chef's menu (Menu Cuistot) featured many preparations of foie gras.. and knowing its going to be banned soon, I made it my quest to have it on my birthday!  I couldn't have chosen a better place to have it.  They even have a 5 course foie menu for those that want to indulge before the dreaded day! I might just have to come back before July to try that ;)\n\nAmuse Bouche - Foie Gras Mousse with Candied Orange and Cocoa Nibs\nChampagne - half glass per person for a taster, Brut, great start to the pairing\nComplimentary Bread Roll - nothing special, pretty hard and difficult to eat, although I don't blame them because this isn't supposed to stand out, only as a courtesy item\n\nFoie Gras Soup - seared foie gras, truffled crackers, glazed baby turnips: the seared foie piece was humungous! I wasn't a fan of the truffle cracker, but the soup was pretty tasty, although it was too rich to finish.\n\nSauteed Burgundy Snails - lemon butter, bone marrow gratin: yummmyyy, the foam on top was a good textural addition\n\nAmuse Bouche - Poached egg in shell, milk, broth, potato chip, broth: Loved this! They managed to saw the egg shell exactly in half, added the poached egg yolk and broth inside with a potato chip covering the top like a lid, very cool.\n\nSeared Day Boat Scallops and foie gras rossini - potatoes and truffles: can't go wrong with a huge piece of scallop and foie!\n\nTrio of Rabbit (Loin, Rack and Braised Leg) - spring vegetables: quite good, but the rabbit was a little too lean for my liking. The three cuts were prepared three different ways, roulade with veggies was my favorite preparation. \n\nPan Seared Beef Tenderloin - Bernaise Croquette, Bone Marrow Custard, Truffle Madeira Sauce: paired with Joseph Jewel Floodgate Vineyard Pinot Noir.  The beef was cooked perfectly, very tender, the bone marrow custard was unique, probably wouldn't be something I'd order again, and the croquette was too creamy.  The main ingredients definitely shined in this dish.\n\nCarbiner Cheese - candied walnuts and honecomb: my first time trying a whole honeycomb, good cheese.\n\nBittersweet Chocolate and Foie Gras Mousses - feuilletine, hazelnut praline sponge cake, gelee, bacon ice cream: the foie mousse was absolutely divine.  The sponge cake reminded me of tempur pedic.. which was weird, and I couldn't pick up the bacon in the bacon ice cream, but the gelee was very tasty.\n\nPetite Fours - complimentary mini desserts (4 per person), this is what we took home\n\nWe got wine pairing with each course, all of which were paired very nicely, one of my favorites being the Joseph Jewel.  The only one I didn't enjoy was the rose colored port that was paired with the dessert, it tasted like sweet rubbing alcohol...maybe I'm just not a fan of port..?\n\nAt the very end, we asked to sign a petition that would repeal the Foie Gras ban.  I really wanted to come back for a full foie dinner, but didn't have the chance to.  All in all, this was the most perfect birthday dinner I've ever had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-02", "description": "We were led by the hostess through the lively main room to our table in the back room. It was as though all life had been sucked of it. The color scheme is best described as \"jester hat.\" It was stuffy.  And tacky.  And horrid.  I asked if the main dining area could accommodate us.  Luckily they had space. Ahh... warm, festive...much better!  Now I'm ready for the It's Au Revoir not Adieu Foie Gras Tasting Menu ($175). Bf isn't big on foie gras and went with three-course menu, ($80).\n\nMeal was kicked off with an amuse bouche of coriander and saffron gel\u00e9e. I normally dislike gelee. This one is pretty good and refreshing. No awkward texture of gel\u00e9e refusing to disintegrate.\n\nThis was followed by an amuse bouche of slow-poached egg yolk with summer squash cream, served in the eggshell and with a brioche crouton on side. I love eggs; this one was enhanced by the cream but highlighted the flavor of the yolk.  Yolk never tasted this good.\n\nThe first course was a foie gras duo and it was not the best start.  The plating was awful.  The soup was served in a cappuccino cup. The foie gras soup tasted a bit like healthy Chinese soup, but creamier.  The truffled crackers didn't taste much like truffle but definitely made the soup tastier.  The seared foie gras sat on a slice of baby turnip.  Turnip?  More Chinese soup memories.  Take away that component and the seared foie gras itself was run-of-the-mill on its own.\n\nThe second course picked up.  This was surprisingly good.  Foie gras torchon is not my favorite but this one was amazing.  It was served on top of a peanut butter fruit bar and strawberry compote.  So, so good.  A small piece of smoked apple BBQ glazed squab sat awkwardly next to it like the person no one invited to the party.  Much like that person, I acknowledged its presence and moved on.  What are you doing here, squab?  Say hello to your mother for me.  \n\nThis was also when my boyfriend got his first course.  The lobster and mushroom risotto in lobster broth was buttery and blew Gary Danko's version out of the water.  It was one of the best dishes of the evening.  \n\nMy third course was foie gras stacked on a giant day-boat scallop sitting on a slice of yukon gold potato, served with truffle sauce.  Oh, and with the tip of one asparagus leaning on this tiny tower.  I don't normally care about plating.  Not really.  But this is just weird.  This has Freud all over it.  The taste was decent, but didn't stand out.  I'm starting to regret eating this much foie gras, but I know that after the ban I won't complain.  \n\nThe bf's second course came at this point.  It was slow-roasted wild king salmon with corn fondue (think creamed corn), snap peas, and morel mushrooms.  I love morel mushrooms.  Between the corn and snap peas, the dish ended up being too sweet.  My bf said it was uneven; parts he had were actually too salty.  \n\nA palate cleanser came after this in the form of a peach and vanilla fizz.  Not great, but I appreciate the effort.  Despite the dishes not being great, I wasn't that disappointed yet because I didn't have high expectations, nor did I think I would order the foie gras tasting menu until I got there.  \n\nThe fourth course almost redeems the meal.  Tournedos Rossini with vegetables, potato pancakes, and a generous amount of truffles shaved on top.  Like the nouveau riche, this was unabashedly decked out.  Ultra decadent and at this point in the meal, sadly, I could only fit a few bites before boxing it up.  I can attest that it was just as good the following day.  The foie gras for this dish narrowly edged out the torchon.  \n\nLastly, dessert was served.  I didn't know what to make of the dessert.  It was good, but not amazing, and I'm not sure if the components all came together for me.  There were chocolate and foie gras mousses on crunchy feuilletine with a layer of cassis jelly, topped with foie gras powder. This was all in the middle and seemed to be the star.  It was flanked by two other items - hazelnut sponge cake, which literally looked like a sea sponge, in color, form, and texture, and bacon ice cream which did not taste like bacon.  The sponge cake was not bad.  It was reminiscent, again, of something Asian - steamed Malaysian sponge cake.  I have to say, I don't know what each of them were doing there.  They could join the squab.  Overall the taste of each were good, with some interesting techniques showcased (cassis pearls, foie gras powder).  \n\nHonorable mention to the petit fours at the end of the meal: http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g0vhFy3T9fb2AYOvH4I6Kg/l.jpg\n\nWhew.  That was a long one.  La Folie is comparable to Gary Danko in many ways, but Gary Danko really one-ups them in food, service and presentation; it's just more modern.  I started plotting my return visit to GD as the meal drew to an end, but I knew halfway through the meal that I wouldn't return to LF. Nonetheless, I think foie gras received a proper sendoff.

We arrived here at 5:30 PM on a Saturday night for dinner and were promptly greeted, our coats and valet stub taken, and seated.\n\nJust about everything we got was good or great.  The only real miss for me was the tempura duck egg w/sweetbread pancake.  It felt like it was underseasoned...just not much taste overall, though I concede that the egg was cooked perfectly.  As for favorites, we really liked the duck entree and the halibut entree.  We also liked the \"Golden Apple\" - maybe some of the other reviews here talk about it - suffice it to say that it was f****n' delicious.  Several small bites were included that were not part of the menu, including some petit fours for a small dessert.\n\nTip: For fine dining, the portions here are quite substantial.  I assumed the portions might be quite small (except the meat/poultry entrees which our server indicated are generous), so we ordered a lot.  Towards the last two courses we realized we were getting quite full.  So you may wish to exercise some restraint when ordering, from a quantity perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that our main server as well as all others attending to us (other servers/water pourers/busboys/etc.) were incredibly polite and attentive.  Our main server did a fantastic job explaining the menu and how things work, as well as all of the specials and such.  The only minor hiccup was that there seemed to be an inordinate wait between the second and third courses.  Overall, though, I can't say enough about the otherwise exceptional service we received beginning to end.\n\nParking sucks so just use the valet.  It was $15 but worth every penny to save your sanity.

I recommend Valet.  Valet service for $15 right when you pull up to the front of the restaurant.  They give you a ticket, which the hostess keeps a part of eventually.  We were wondering why but it turns out to be.. that as you finish paying for your meal.. They have your car all ready for you at the front of the restaurant.  I was impressed and surprised.  Very good coordination on the restaurant's part! No waiting for your car to pull up, which is a first that I've seen so far.  \n\nService: Excellent.  Our waiter was delightful and very helpful in recommendations.  They made sure if we needed a wine expert to recommend us some bottle of wine to accompany our meal.  Our waiter also knew his food and ingredients really well.  Very well organized when bringing out our dishes all at once in our part of 4.  Friendly and welcoming indeed.  \n\nVenue:  There are 2 rooms that I saw as I entered the restaurant.  I actually would of preferred sitting in the first room because of the chic brown/orangish lighting.  We were seated in the back room.  I figured it was more quiet which was better for my mother's birthday.  The back room was decorated in green and purple with masks and litted ceiling.  It described La Folie very well.  Wine cellar was located in the back room also.  From what I saw on yelp though, there is a lounge but I have no clue where that was!\n\nFood:\nI love the amuse bouches given to us complimentarily. cute arrangements, small, refreshing, just the right amount to enjoy and want more.  The chef gave us a total of 3. (don't mind the vagueness in the amuse bouche descriptions. I can't remember it all! )\n1. Asparagus with a citrus blend and crouton- very simplistic and crunchy asparagus texture. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hSGy3xJRxHT-ZAlsyJpPmQ/l\n2. Egg yolk mixed with potato leek and bacon- this was delicious mixed in.  It was contained in a egg shell. Very creative! http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SCzr__jZkYMz-uAQxnisbg/l\n3. Fresh creme with strawberry puree- to cleanse the palette before your dessert.  it was cold and delicious sauce. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GUX9eodapirN6ODkWjrFHw/l\n\nAppetizer: Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras - BIG serving indeed. I can usually take this delicious, fatty chunk of heaven but I was surprised at how much it was given! ( additional $10 ) But all worth it. I haven't had foie gras in ages so it hit the spot, making me melt and forget the calories I was about to intake. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OR5MstehRX7si-E5nAIMoQ/l\n\nEntree: Seared Liberty Farm Duck Breast with Duck Confit - a duck salad accompanied the sliced duck breast.  It was a refreshing side as a break from the chunks of meat in front of me.  The duck was so flavorful.  Medium rare is the way to go. You can never go wrong with duck!  Very juicy with its confit. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J3fXulime4l3e_jcf7kfLw/l\n\nThis meal was topped off with a 2000 bottle of bordeaux red wine.  Delicious!\n\nDessert: Warm Edam Cheese Souffle with Fromage Blanc Sorbet- small portion that is perfect for the end of a big meal.  It came with a delicious fresh sorbet on the side, crisp bacon and nuts underneath. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mngcrhDyT33RkyAJVCuOIg/l \n\nTo top it off, we got complimentary chocolates for each person.  Apricot squares, Brandy madelines, Hazelnut squares, and another little pastry that was simple but delicious.", "author": "Kathy D."}

And I love that they let you choose your 4 courses from almost any section of the menu. But I had to say I was a little disappointed. I am kind of use to the rich flavors when dining at a French place, but most of the items were more bland:\n\nJust mediocre: \n-Sauteed Snails w/bonemarrow\n-Dayboat scallops\n-Pan seared Black cod \n\nWorthy:\n-Lobster risotto \n-Peach melba dessert\n\nHowever my two friend girls who ordered Lobster Risotto is worth mentioning. It was very flavorful and lovely. The corn soup was too sweet. I really prefer Escargots and wished they had that instead. Out of all the desserts, I only really liked the Peach melba dessert. The cheese souffle was savory and the napoleon was too hard. In the end, I concluded I'll go to Chapeau! any other day instead.", "author": "Alice K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-30", "description": "The reviews for La Folie are interesting - lots of enthusiastic 5 stars, some from repeat customers who seem to know what they're talking about. We seem to have had a different experience last night.\n\nWe did the full tasting menu with wine paring - around $450 for 2 with tax/tip. So question is, how does that compare against other $500ish dinners we've had in the bay area?\n\nTechnique and plating-wise, everything's great, modern, and pretty. Flavors, though, were bland. As an example, the steak was nicely cooked sous-vide and then well seared, but not seasoned at all. Great texture, no flavor. We had to ask for salt.\n\nThe lobster was good, but not the \"OMG AMAZING\" that a lot of reviews mentioned. \n\n$80 wine paring for 5 pours - not bad, but a little high compared to a $115 menu. Wine presentation was quickly rattled off so I only really understood one of the wines we had. The wines themselves weren't really noteworthy, but paired well with the food. (hmm.)\n\nOn the dessert plate, strawberries were briefly roasted which was interesting, but the stems were left in, just greens chopped off. I presume this was not an accident, but result was bite into soft roasted outside of strawberry, then hit firm flesh, then hit strawberry core and chew. On the same plate there was a piece of cake - uninteresting, seeming a little stale. Thanks, I guess? To counter, the quinelle of basil ice cream was excellent.\n\nService was good, except for chef coming over to say the obligatory hello. Chef, maybe you were tired, or not feeling well, or whatever - but I'll get a warmer reception walking into one of the sushi boat joints in Japan Town. If you don't want to engage with me, that's fine. Busy yourself in the back, or keep talking to the table of your buddies that you spent 15-20 minutes talking to. \"Hello, thanks for coming\" *walks off* I get that a McDonalds for a lot less.\n\nFor the petits fours, chocolate ganache was great - could have had 10 of those. The mini-madelines were nothing special (Starbucks sells better). Mini cannolis seemed like they had been sitting on a shelf for a week or so (bland filling, soft pastry with no flake, very chewy bottom).\n\nIf you're looking for a nice night out, there's plenty of better executions a few examples include Commis, RN74, Boulevard, Perbacco, Sons & Daughters, or Prospect.\n\nI think for a $460 check I should give this 2 stars, but I'll leave it at 3. My gut feel is if Bauer re-reviewed in the morning, La Folie would be getting 2 stars, not 3.\n\nBy the way, it's almost June - take the 2014 NYE menus off the website.", "author": "John K."}

While the rest of the old guard glide gracefully into the night, Roland is leading us gastronomes into the light, and it's bright, very bright. \n\nLa Folie is an institution. Let's start with that. The decor, service, and food has continually moved forward with the times, never standing still to appreciate itself or give itself a pat. In the way that great artists constantly reinvent themselves, this fine business in Russian Hill has matured beautifully. It's hard to say that about any artistic endeavor over time. \n\nReason being quite simply, is that chef Passot is behind the stoves. He's not launching new restaurants or tv shows that take him out of his kitchen. He's there to train his young staff to appreciate executing the basics. \n\nThat's the thing about La Folie. You know it's roots are deep into the classics that make French cuisine so appealing to us. This allows them to branch out into new territory.  Modern, global, farm to table, all definitions chefs try to use in there dialect, but without a foundation, they are just words. Chef Passot, by being there as walking talking encyclopedia of deliciousness, provides the next generation of chefs the resources to soar. \n\nFood rooted in Classic French technique with modern, seasonal, and sustainable accoutrements. That's balls. \n\nThe call. Tasting menu hands down is the way to do it. It's rich. It's generously portioned. And it's delicious. It's expensive, yes, but you can skip breakfast and lunch for sure, and be satiated by dinner.", "author": "Chris K."}

We asked if we could get a table in the dining area versus the noisy lounge and they were able to get us in.\n\nJust a great experience.  The server was super attentive and kind for a last minute table as they approached the 10:30 closing time.  We went with:\n\nPeach Melba Baked Alaska -- Brown Sugar Cake, Peach Ice Cream, Peach Sorbet, Raspberry Coulis\n\nSummer Berry \"Napol\u00e9on\" -- Pistachio Diplomat Cream, Sweet Milk Sherbet, Blackberry Glaze\n\nBoth were absolutely delicious, and between the two it was layer after layer after layer of flavor (yeah, we tackily split our desserts 50/50 across the table  :)\n\nEven though we dropped in for dessert only, we received a palate cleanser-a mini drink of melon with a fresh raspberry before our baked alaska and Napolean arrived.  We asked if there was any alcohol.  Our server said there was a tad.  We explained we don't drink and said thank you.  She whisked them away and then returned with alcohol free versions that were tasty and refreshing.\n\nBeyond that, we were also served the Petite Fours to sample with our coffee and tea after our desserts.  Tasty little nibbles of chocolate, berry, a cookie and a meringue.\n\nSuch a super nice, last minute, exceptionally accommodating, delicious late night \"drop-in\", and the server bringing us alcohol free versions of the little melon drinks was so thoughtful and kind.

I hadn't been able to see the menu so I called to ask about it and found that I basically couldn't eat anything due to my dietary restrictions. Elsa called back and my husband (I have laryngitis and can't communicate via phone right now!) told her my restrictions and she said the chef would do his best to make something I can enjoy as well (I am always happy to eat ahead, but figure it's worth asking if there are options for me). I know it is short notice to create something special for me so I am thoroughly impressed with the customer service of both Elsa and the chef in being willing to accommodate me. I don't even care if it's good (though I'm sure it will be), this is one of the best experiences I've had since being on a restricted diet, so I am already a happy customer. Thank you!\n\nUpdate: the dinner was actually unbelievable. I had as much if not more food than everyone I was with and the chef made an appetizer for me to match each app my group had (I haven't had appetizers in years!).

Chef Roland Passot and his wife have owned and operated this classic French restaurant since 1988 and their experience in giving you an experience shows. \n\nI love that you are given choices. You can choose the Chef's tasting menu (5 course ++) for $125.00 with optional wine pairing; or you can choose a  3 course ($85.00) 4 course ($105.00) or a 5 course ($125.00) off the a la carte side of the menu. And you can mix and match both sides as you desire.  You can also choose all appetizers, or all fish, or all dessert. The only course you can't choose an all of is the meat course, and that just makes sense. We chose a 4 course meal (expect to spend about 3 hours on this) and this, along with the Chef's amuses, was a lot of food. These are not small portions, tiny plates. These are full portions, cooked perfectly and plated beautifully. \n\nThe wine pairings are spot on, but La Folie has a wonderful wine list as well. And a full bar. My son enjoyed an ale with his dinner...so you don't even have to order wine. Service is wonderful and professional.

We occupied the whole back room. I can say from my experience here that this restaurant has amazing and attentive service. My water was never empty. At the amuse bouche, I was offered small bites every so often. There was always a smile on the waitresses/waiters faces. And my favorite part, they explained in detail what was being served as they were serving each course! \n\nOnto the food, I've been wanting to try the salmon lollipops since the day I bookmarked this restaurant! They were delicious! And for the other small bites, we had some truffle puff thing, and lobster sandwich bites. After a few pieces of each, I was already getting full but they were just so yummy... So I kept eating.\n\nFor a few other things I got...\nChestnut parsnip soup - really delicious and creamy! \nGoat cheese tatin - this was one of the things I didn't like... I love goat cheese but this plate just didn't work for me... It was sour & salty and something in this dish stung the inside of my mouth. Weird! This stingy feeling sort of stayed until I had my risotto entree... \nCrab salad - pretty good. Loved the presentation!\nLobster and mushroom risotto - by this point, I was quite full! However, the risotto was delicious so I kept eating. The lobster was a little tough though.\nEmigh farm lamb rack - DELICIOUS! And I LOVE the colors on this plate! It was like a sunset!\nCoconut tapioca - this was probably my favorite dish of the night (of course, it would be dessert, right?) the coconut tapioca and the mango pur\u00e9e were just perfect for each other :)\nEdam cheese souffl\u00e9 - ever had bacon bits with souffl\u00e9?!

We arrived and to my relief the elder hostess who carefully looks you up and down to asses if you are worthy to eat there was not on duty.  When seated my husband and I ordered martinis to start.  I received mine and our waiter reported they did not have Stoli Vodka.  The husband asked for a bar menu to make another selection.  After 20 minutes the waiter returned.  In the meantime the two of us had been sharing my cocktail and we had decided to order champagne and caviar, both of selections on the menu, to compare the difference between the two offerings as we were curious why one was more expensive than the other.  This is approximately $150.00 of caviar based on the menu prices.  Our champagne arrived about ten minutes later.  We waited, and waited.  We had been in the Restuarant for an hour, seated promptly, with no food forthcoming.  My husband walked to the bar/hostess stand to ask when we might see some food and was told they would look into it.  The floor manager came to our table and said the kitchen was now plating our food and it would arrive shortly.  Our caviar appeared shortly thereafter, and in the middle of our enjoying this, our waiter appeared and said, \" I am sorry this is so late, but at this time of night you must understand we are Soooo busy.\"  We looked at him and related that we weren't interested in his excuses and that he could leave immediately.  What a turn off, especially at those prices!  While finishing we decided that spending another $300.00 here was not worth it and when the floor manager arrived with our \"Chef's Amuse\" we asked for our check and left for another Restuarant which actually provided service.", "author": "Kathleen F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-20", "description": "So Greg and I went cliche and decided to go with French for our post-Valentine's Day dinner (getting in on the 15th rather than the 14th avoids all the hoo-ha of VDay), and it lived up to all of my expectations.  Greg's been here a few times, but this was my first and I made sure I was every bit of adventurous as I could be.  Both of us went in with the understanding that we were going to need to be rolled out by selecting the 4 course menu option.  When we walked in, we were seated immediately in a cozy corner table by the window.  Our waiter was prompt, gave us some time to think over the menu, and gave us the truffle show.  Once we had some time to do some serious strategy, we selected the following items from the menu:\n\nCourse 1:\nL: Triple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg\nG: Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine\n\nMy duck egg was absolutely decadent.  That's a pretty fancy word for an egg, but right when you cut into it, it oozed out delicious yolk.  The sweetbreads pancake it came on was delicious and the truffle vinaigrette was also excellent.  It goes without saying as well that the amuse bouche that's highly advertised is also excellent.  In particular, the egg that held egg and potato soup with the crispy potato chip on top was my personal fav!\n\nCourse 2:\nL/G: Butter Poached Lobster\n\nPersonally, I'm not one to ask for lobster in restaurants, but I was feeling particularly ambitious and decided that I wanted a seafood item rather than another appetizer or salad.  This was probably my favorite dish of the night, maybe only second to the dessert.  But seriously, this was amazing.  The lobster was cooked wonderfully, and the celery ravioli it was on top of was also great!  I ate just about everything except the shell.  Greg's also not one who orders lobster, but the fact that we both cleaned the plate on this meant that we TOTALLY loved it.\n\nCourse 3:\nL: Duck Breast and Crispy Duck Confit Gateau\nG: Roti of Quail and Squab\n\nSo, the menu description for the duck would suggest that the dish only comes with two items.  However, when the plate was delivered, I was told there was an additional item: duck tongue.  Not a big deal, and to be honest, I was curious, but I took one bite of this and immediately spit it back out.  Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough for an experience like this, but it tasted like boiled fish.  Since it wasn't advertised on the menu, I can't say that I was overly disappointed, just a little annoyed that this was as far from edible as it could be.  The rest of the dish though, absolutely amazing.  The crispy duck and the breast were soft and tender and the passion fruit gastrique that was on top of the duck was equally great.  Greg enjoyed the quail and squab, he tried romanesco for the first time, and thought that the crispy potatoes around the squab and quail really made the dish.  I think we both agreed that there was a lot of food that came on the plate, but this was definitely better than receiving elf sized portions for dinner.\n\nCourse 4:\nL: Valrhona Chocolate Bread Pudding with Guava Macaroon and Popcorn Ice Cream\nG: Three types of cheeses, one bleu cheese, one was creamy (described to us as \"triple cream\"), and the other was a hard cheese.  We don't remember the names :(\n\nSo, the bread pudding.  I love it, it's one of my big indulgences when we go out to dinner and have dessert.  The bread pudding itself was good, but what really sold me was the macaroon and the ice cream.  Accompanied with the two items were toffee popcorn.  I love everything about popcorn, and to mix the two together was absolutely perfect.  The cheese plate was provided before the bread pudding, and the waiter and sommelier worked together to pair the cheese with the wine we had (one 1/2 bottle of the 2007 Chehalem from Oregon and another 1/2 bottle of the 2007 Nuits St. Georges Burgundy, as recommended by the sommelier).\n\nOverall, we both thought that this was a really wonderful way to spend Valentine's Day.  The service we had was wonderful, the food was great, got to shake the chef's hand and compliment him on dinner on the way out, and had a wonderful cappuccino to end the night.  Thank you Greg for such a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner!", "author": "Lisa I."}

The tasting menu failed big time.\n\nI ordered the foie gras, corn soup, risotto and quail+squab. Everything was very good. The quail+squab was fantastic, possibly out of this world fantastic. The corn soup was 'drown me in it' good. Risotto was good but not a real risotto - Had 5:1 of stuff:rice which was odd and reminded me of pot pie filling. Based on the food I ordered: 5 stars, easy.\n\nMy wife ordered off of the chef's tasting menu and this is where things FELL APART and went up in flames. Rocket launch and two engines fell off. It was BAD. \n\n- Hamachi appetizer: No flavor at all. There was a grilled avocado which did NOTHING and screamed love me because I'm an avocado.\n- Lobster wrapped w/ radishes: This was BAD. The plate should have gone back to the kitchen but we had waited 45 minutes between dishes already. The lobster was inedible. You couldn't cut it with a knife - It was VERY rubbery and chewy. To boot, zero flavor. (Not sure how you do that with lobster...)\n- Ribeye: I am 90% sure the cut of meat served was a tenderloin, not ribeye. ZERO marbling and the texture matched a filet/tenderloin cut. Could be wrong, but regardless, the meat had zero flavor and was overcooked. The meat was definitely not seasoned at all - I'm sure that violates a steak ordinance.\n- Cheese plate: I loved it for her.\n- Dessert: Unfortunately, this was the dish she enjoyed the most. Great presentation and delicious.\n\nIf you're going here, trust the regular menu and eye the tasting menu with skepticism.\n\nQuick comparison:\n\nFood (regular menu): Toss up between GD and LF.

It was one of my best meals and a couple of the dishes I had made it on my last-meal-on-earth list.  (It was also quite entertaining to sit across from Carmen Policy and seeing all the foods he was getting from the chef personally)\n\nAppetizers:\n\nPoached Octopus and Uni Salad: It's a sparse sprinkle of excellent octopus and uni.  The dish is very refreshing and light so it's a good dish to start off with if you want to start lightly.  \n\nSauteed Burgundy Snails with Bone Marrow:  This was so rich, buttery and creamy it was effin' amazing.  They put the escargot on top of the bone marrow and it's completely lathered with the parsley sauce, which didn't taste much like parsley what with all the butter oozing around.  This is one of my fave dishes.\n\nEntrees:\n\nDay Boat Scallop with Squid Ink Spaghetti and Uni:  MUST EAT!!!  The squid ink spaghetti was done perfectly, giving you that little crunch of pasta.  And the flavorful lobster broth, which really looked like a sea of uni foam, complemented the pasta so well.  The dish was a little fishy overall but it was perfect for me.  I really didn't need the scallop - after all, I was going for the uni, which did not disappoint.  I could live on this for the rest of my life.  Well... okay, maybe a month.\n\nLobster and Mushroom Risotto: Another winning dish.  La Folie really knows how to work with lobster broth so if you see any dishes with it, just order it.  It's bound to be flavorful and just plain yummy.\n\nLamb Chop:  I was so stuffed by the time my final dish came out but of course, I still took a bite.  Fabulously done.\n\nRoti of Quail and Squab:  The bf (you thought this was all by myself, didn't you?) ordered this and it was a huge serving.  Both quail and squab was very tender and moist but we took 95% of it home.\n\nDessert:  The bday dessert - miniature cakes and pastries - were very cute and delish.\n\nThe service was not excellent but it was not terrible either.

It was a nice corner unit, very quiet and intimate. Candles lit, flowers on table, champagne waiting in the chiller.... \n\nThe server was very attentive and very corteous. She gave us time and privacy to discuss the food. So few mins later, we opted for 4 & 5 course meal. Our server came and explained to us the way they serve the food. She poured me some bubblies & a red for the hubby. \n\nAs we wait for our first course, they put a basket of bread and butter on our table then we were served the amuse bouche. It's a small piece fruit to open up your taste buds/palate. After the amuse bouche, comes our first course. The server explained to us everytime the food comes out how the food was made and how to properly eat them to experience the different layers of flavors. \n\nWe had our first course, we both ordered the sweet corn soup with lobster then they served us the triple T Ranch poached egg. For second course I had the Warm Pig Feet, Sweet Bread and Lobster Terrine which is a huge portion for appetizer in a French restaurant. Hubby got the Trio of Passot Roe. Third course came, we both ordered the Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut then hubby got his fourth course of lamb rack. Dessert came as my fourth course and his 5th course then served us some kind of shooter to cleanse our palate.\n\nThen there's a surprise plate of different chocolates served right after we had our dessert!!! What a treat for someone with a sweet tooth!!\n\nThen Chef Passot came out to greet me a happy birthday in person which is so unexpected. I've been to other popular restaurants but the chef never comes out of the kitchen to meet & greet their diners.\n\n$400 for 4/5 course meal is definitely a little pricey but we will definitely come back soon. We had a great experience at La Folie & can't wait to be back for more.", "author": "Kathy P."}

Standouts were the snails with bone marrows tantin, the dungeness crab, the duck breast, the squall and squab duo. If you love truffle, the Triple-T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg will be your jam!

When the day came I think i looked over the menu for hours.   Getting here can be a pain. Parking is very limited and we are almost late for our reservations.  The restaurant has valet parking if you don't want the hassle of going in circles for parking.  The hostess greeted us immediately when we arrived and took my coat.   \n\nAfter we were seated the server told us the special for the night, I already knew what i wanted.  I started out with the tempura egg and it was delicious. I have no idea how the manged to make it so soft where the yolk is still leaking out and yet have a perfect coating of tempura. For my appetizer, i ordered the Seared Foie Gras. When it arrived I was completely shocked. The portion was huge, ok maybe it was humongous, or enormous, maybe gigantic, actually it was  magnificent and immeasurable.  It was good yet, I think it was i little bit overcooked on the sides.  The foie Gras literally filled me up that, there was no way i  could even touch my main course. However, I think i like the foie gras at Chapeau more because of their pairing.  As for the main course i had the Quail and Squab, stuffed with Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings.  It looked very presentable, making it difficult for me to ruin it . It wasn't bad, it had a lot of flavors dancing in my mouth.  The portions they give at this place is actually very generous. We had the dessert too which had chocolates and french madaline.  The madalines were good, but the rest were too sweet for me.   I think if i were to come back i will just try to get a small main dish because i do want to try their foie gras again.  However, Chapeau and Gary Danko are still on the top of my list. They have a sister lounge next door if you want to end the night perfectly with your date, I'll have that review for that later.I", "author": "Belinda C."}

La Folie is the perfect choice to celebrate a special event or for just a nice evening out.  The more casual lounge is next door to the formal, but cozy, dining room.\n\nAs we were waiting to be seated Chef Passot happened to stroll out of the kitchen and stopped by to say a few kind words to us.  As a foodie, I was doing jumpy claps (not literally) and excited for the evening to come.  We decided or order a combination of 3 and 4 course meals, having been warned that the portions were on the generous side (compared to other restaurants of this caliber) and that we should err on the side of caution.  \n\nAfter a couple of amuse bouches I started with the appetizer of warm pig feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine over a lentil salad.  The dish was rich and unctuous and so full of flavor.  You'll want to eat every last bite, pork fat and all!\n\nFor the second course I ordered the pan seared wild black cod with truffled gnocchi.  This fish was amazing!  It was so moist and tender and perfectly cooked.  The skin was seared crisp.  This dish was perfectly executed.  The veggies that came with the dish would make any meat lover eat their greens.\n\nI chose the duck breast for my third course.  Now I love Chinese roast duck and when made properly, nothing matches it.  This duck matched it.  The duck was absolutely delicious and cooked to a perfect medium.  The meat was so tender I almost didn't need my knife to cut through it.  If you love duck you'll love this preparation.\n\nFor dessert we shared the huckleberry Baked Alaska, the carrot cake with ginger brulee and the Fuji apple tarte tatin.  All three were good, but the Baked Alaska won us all over.  It's didn't come out flaming and thankfully didn't come drowned in alcohol.   This must be one of the desserts selected for your meal.\n\nService was excellent and top notch.  Our waiter was so friendly and helpful, as was the sommelier, and the staff all wished me a happy birthday upon our exit.  Everyone was made to feel comfortable, from those dining alone to those in large groups.\n\nParking can get tough in this neighborhood at times; they do offer valet parking.\n\nI perfect evening overall.

We find it incredibly difficult to go out and eat with my husbears dietary restrictions and La Folie was able to work around it and my husbear couldn't stop praising them for the incredible dinner we had.

Roland Passot's menus have always had a wonderful traditional look to them but my preference for innovative ideas has always led me to other restaurants on my previous trips.\n\nHowever, the pictures of his food on the website looked very contemporary and absolutely mouth-watering, leading me to finally add this stalwart of San Fran fine dining to my restaurant collection\n\nThe streets surrounding the restaurant are all metered and my ever-widening circle in search of parking actually led me on a mini detour driving down the famous windy bit of Lombard - hehe, well, I had never driven down it and I was suddenly just there!\n\nI had to eventually admit defeat and pay $15 for valet parking at the restaurant. I was greeted warmly and led to the ancillary dining room which had a most grand atmosphere with high ceilings. One thing was that the low lighting did cause a few problem with some of my fellow diners having to resort to use light from their phones to read the menu. Fortunately, I had already studied the menu carefully before I chose to eat there!\n\nI decided to make up my menu and fortunately, as it turned out, I went for 4 dishes, not 5. The kitchen's generosity was immediately obvious with the arrival of 3 amuse bouche courses. These actually were the most playful and innovative courses and in my subsequent chat with Chef Passot, he confirmed that he was using them to experiment and show his modern flair. The amuses included salmon lollipops, compressed melon and a wonderful umami-laden egg based dipping sauce served in an eggshell with bread soldier to dip\n\nI kicked off my evening with warm pig feet, foie gras and lobster terrine on a lentil salad with bacon & hazelnut vinaigrette. The combination was divine though very rich. The richness and the portion size did start to alarm me a little - it was the size of an entree and I was already starting to feel a little full!\n\nMy second appetiser was the seared Hudson Valley foie gras with caramelised peach. Now, foie gras is one of my favourite ingredients and I never thought I would hear myself say this but the portion size scared me! I have never seen foie gras this size before - it was about 3 times the size of the half peach. Cooked to perfection but due to the richness, I did struggle a bit\n\nFor entree, I had the Liberty Farm Duck, which came as 3 different preparations - roast breast, smoked duck tongue and slow cooked leg. Wonderfully executed French cooking as usual. Each cut did taste distinctive and I probably enjoyed the leg most though once again, teh rich food was beginning to take its toll\n\nThey had insisted that I order dessert at the beginning of the meal. If I hadn't had to do that, I would probably have cancelled dessert because I was stuffed by this point. However, the signature baked alaska duly arrived and I enjoyed the flavours very much\n\nIt's unusual to be critical of a restaurant for being too generous but for a little Brit like me, there was just too much food - the appetisers were all entree size and perhaps I had ordered too many rich dishes but I did struggle. However, the cooking was reliably first rate\n\nA wonderful bonus for me was that I chatted to Chef Passot for a few minutes at the end of the meal when I saw him at the kitchen door. We talked about his food philosophy and about restaurants he had eaten at in London on his recent visit there. It's clear that he retains a passion for cooking despite the many years that he has been leading his restaurant. This love for food shines through in his cooking", "author": "Yee Gan O."}

Much to my dismay, I realized I had slacked off a bit. How many restaurants do I write about in comparison to the number I've experienced? I blush.\n\nAwhile ago, T had offered to take me to any restaurant of my choice. He was interested in everywhere and everywhere, since it had been awhile since his last fine dining experience. \"Butter-poached lobster and cheese souffles!\" I exclaimed. About five evenings later, there he was, waiting for me on 2316 Polk Street.\n\nI ran up and down Market, chasing every yellow vehicle that was within distance. Nobody stopped for me. I finally found my way to the restaurant, 30 minutes late. I accidentally walked into a crowded dark room, which turned out to be their next-door lounge.\n\nFirst off, we had the best seats in the house! Our server, Ben, was the most darling man and very patient. When he noticed my infatuation with truffles, he offered to put truffles on all our dishes! I wanted to opt to offer him a hug.\n\nI absolutely adored the butter-poached lobster, cheese souffle, tempura duck egg, pea soup, and the two amuse bouches (egg&brioche and the carrot soup). All of my favorite flavors were delicately summed into one meal (buttery, cheesy, fried, and sweet). My only qualm was my Pimm's Cup. It was a little funky-- almost like a spiked iced tea. T really enjoyed all of it, along with his quail. \"Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time,\" to be specific.\n\nWe were both stuffed beyond our minds when we left, so full we were both pushing dessert away (a clear sign of one losing his/her mind). We smiled anyway, and thanked Ben for the wonderful evening.\n\nIf La Folie weren't so distant (and if catching cabs didn't feel like chasing butterflies), I'd definitely come back.

Also, there was the more standard course menu and then a select tasting menu, and I loved the flexibility from the restaurant to mix and match courses from both.

There's always that reference to that crooked used car salesman of some industry - La Folie is the used car salesman of the french restaurant industry. The name says something in french - it translates into Madness - the only madness I felt was why I wasted my time and money on this establishment. The food is marginal - you will get better French food at an establishment like Le Zinc in Noe Valley (trust me). Also, the used car salesman comes from the fact that they bait you in the cheapest way possible - they make you smell ingredients - and for an extra 50 dollar surcharge you can actually eat it.\n\nFirst off, the food was bland and lacked something that made this place shine. Second making us bait into some ingredient. And since it was for a  Birthday - they never gave  a piece of cake, or even a cake... they rolled the cake into my desert!

Then I forgot about it and I saw the website again and sent it to my bf and told him how shitty it looked. Haha. Then I finally read the reviews of this place and figured it couldn't be that bad. \n\nThe food here was presented like a piece of art! I don't think I've gone to a restaurant where all the courses were amazing. \n\nMy bf and I both went with the 3 courses. I'm so glad they asked me if we had any allergies because they brought out two amuse bouches and the 2nd one contained bacon so they brought me this salad thing. Haha. How considerate of them! The only other place to do that was MIchael Mina. \n\nThe woman at the door always has her glare face on and our waiter looked like this asshole I dated. Haha. \n\nI ordered the Lobster Risotto, Poached Lobster, and this Apple Trio for dessert. Mind you I have a shellfish allergy and one of the amuse bouches was also lobster! Haha. Lucky I didn't break out in hives since I just barely recovered from the rash from hell I got from Gary Danko. Every dish was delicious and I always judge a restaurant by their desserts and the apple composition was AMAZING to say the least. \n\nBF had the veal, foie gras, and the cheese souffle for dessert. He kept raving about the foie gras and it was the prettiest plate of them all! \n\nPetit Fours were a hit or miss. If you get something that looks like sugared candy, be forewarned, it is super sour! Take tiny bites please. \n\nThe most expensive dinner I've ever had and well worth every penny.

La Folie is a small, intimate restaurant and the food is phenomenal. The service is outstanding, as well. They sat us at a darling corner table and we had the most romantic night enjoying food side by side. We had two amuse bouche courses to start the meal and both were unreal. \n\nWe had so much to eat but I have to say my favorites out of our dinner were the Burgundy snails in pernod lemon butter and bone marrow gratin, and the seared day boat scallop and foie gras rossini. These were absolutely outstanding. I have never had better escargot in my life. The presentation was magical because they placed the snails inside a veal bone and the marrow flavored them so nicely. The texture was perfection! Also, anything rossini is always amazing, so an out-of-this-world seared scallop with foie gras and truffle was heavenly :); it melted in my mouth. \n\nEverything else was delicious, but the dessert may have been the show stopper. I did a cheese course, but my bf had the Valrhona bread pudding with green tea white chocolate ganache and strawberry ice cream. We both loved every single aspect about this dessert! The bread pudding had the perfect texture and the ganache and ice cream were delectable with every bite.

I booked my reservations around Christmas just to be safe.  Normally the fixed courses start around $120 per person but on Valentine's Day it was $180 per person.  A few days earlier the President of France ate there and enjoyed everything so that was a really good sign of things to come.  I got there 10 minutes prior to my reservation time and I was offered to go to the lounge next door where they would get me.  We waited for about 20 minutes and someone came over to get us. \n\nOur server, Diane, was very helpful.  I'm not a frequent diner of fancy restaurants but I love to go occasionally for the experience and of course, the food.  I always ask the lame questions like, \"How do you eat this?\" or \"How do I use this utencil?\"  When a server can laugh with you politely and still answer your lame questions then it's a good place in my book.  I had to wave down the wine guy, which I've never done before.  I got a half bottle of Cab for $89 and it went well with our dinner.  \n\nThe whole meal took about 2 hours (5 course meal), as compared to the 3 hours at Fleur De Lys on a non special day/holiday.

If I COULD, I would rate this a 4.75.\n\nFirst and foremost, the service was impeccable, as everyone else who reviewed this restaurant has previously mentioned.  The staff definitely makes you feel that you are in a fine-dining environment, without the pretentious and stuffy attitudes.  Our server was young and very down-to-earth, yet extremely professional, making me and my boyfriend's two-year anniversary very relaxed.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I did not expect it to be SO small!  I liked it though -- very intimate.  The hostess led us into a back room that was much quiter, and sat us at an intimate corner table.  I loved that they honored my special request on my OpenTable reservation!\n\nI had already studied the menu weeks prior to our reservation, because I was so excited to try this place out after reading all the reviews.  My boyfriend and I went with (complimentary amuse bouches and palate cleansers included):\n\nCauliflower Amuse Bouche: I didn't catch all the ingredients from our server, but it was a light spoonful to get our palate going.\n\nDuck Egg Amuch Bouche: This was excellent.  The presentation was creative, with the yolk and leek \"soup\" served inside the egg, with a long piece of brioche on the side for dipping.  I loved this in every way.  Usually I don't like that yolky taste, but there wasn't ANY trace of that whatsoever in this dish.  The leeks definitely balanced everything out.\n\nRussian Osetra Caviar: Being our anniversary, we decided to spoil ourselves a little.  We added a half ounce for an additional $60, served over creme fraiche and blinis stuffed with lobster and cauliflower.  Heaven!  You would get chunks of lobster in your bites!\n\n(...after getting through these three courses, we were amazed when we realized that we hadn't even gotten to our actual first course from the menu yet!)\n\n1) Me: Butternut Squash Soup- I was hoping for the Duck Consomme that was available on the online menu, but it wasn't on the restaurant menu.  The soup was good.  I forgot what was served at the center... I know one was a marshmallow that melted, and the rest tasted like pork?\nHim: Triple T Duck Egg- WOW. Just wow. I wish I had ordered this one. The chef shaved black truffle over this as a special treat for us. The combination of flavors burst in your mouth. I have no criticism for this dish.\n\n2) Me: Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras (+$10)- How could I not order this after reading all the reviews about this GIANT, succulent piece of delight? My only complaint is that the apple served with it was a bit overpowering.\nHim: Burgundy Snails in Bone Marrow: My FAVORITE dish of the night. Presentation alone was an A+ with the snails inside the actual bone. Best combo of flavors.\n\n3) Me: Black Cod- Ordered this out of the Yelp recommendations. Was not disappointed. The fish was perfectly cooked with the skin crispy. The mushrooms, truffle, ...everything, delicous!\nHim: Butter Poached Lobster: I only tried one bite but I recall it being perfectly cooked.\n\nThen we were served a berry palate cleanser.  Was light and refreshing.\n\n4) Me: I substitued the Tasting of Passot Roe for the meat course as I knew I was going to be way too full to make it to dessert.  This dish was actually a little bland, in my opinion.  I hate to say it!  I LOVE roe, though I felt that the scallop ceviche, oyster, and hiramasa were underwhelming.  I know that trout/salmon roe is naturally salty, but the dish seemed to have had addtional salt added, which sort of ruined it. Maybe it was just me.  The roe was also a bit harder than I'm used to.  However, I'm glad I went with this, as it was still light and refreshing after the previous rich courses.\nHim: \"Le Beouf\" (+$20): HUGE portion. Wow. I was too full to want to taste this, but it came with a little foie gras slider.\n\n5) Me: Of course I went with the cheese plate, as I don't like sweets. I love my cheese!\nHim: Cheese souffle.  I had a bite of this, and it was delicious.  Was actually not too sweet at all.\n\nLastly, we were brough out petite fours, with a piece of chocalate in the middle that read \"Happy Anniversary.\"  I love restaurants that go above and beyond to make special occasions memorable.\n\nWith a bottle of champage and sparkling water, our bill came out to $400, without tip, and it was worth EVERY penny.  I can't wait to come back.  Thank you for making our anniversary spectacular, La Folie!", "author": "Gina L."}

Parking is difficult in the area. To prevent us from losing our reservation, the boyfriend dropped me off first. Because it was still a bit early for dinner, the place only had two parties and lots of empty tables. A younger lady greeted me as I came in and was going to sit me while I waited for the boyfriend. But before I was able to get anywhere, the elder lady intercepted and asked that I be seated after everyone in my party arrives. She told me to wait by the door/bar area, where I kept dodging a waitress who was going back and forth bring drinks to a table. Thinking it was their policy to only sit people when the whole party was there, and convincing myself that the younger female is new and didn't know the policy (that's why she tried to sit me when i walked in), I didn't say anything even though I was getting really annoyed.\n\nThe boyfriend finally arrives and we are take to the back room, where we were seated. I thought it was strange that we were seated in the back because the front room was near empty.  However, I reasoned that it was because the other tables were reserved for other parties. As I sat there, I noticed all the non-Caucasians were seated in the back room and all who were Caucasians were in the front room. At this point, I'm feeling disgusted. How is it that I'm feeling discriminated in a melting pot city like San Francisco and while at a highly recommended restaurant? I ended up sharing my thoughts with the boyfriend. Standing at the table over was our waiter, who was able to hear everything coming out of my mouth. Within 5 minutes, that old lady for sat me brings a Caucasians man in to the back room. Did my thoughts get passed to her and she was trying to save her and the restaurant's image, or is it really a coincidence? Hmmm...\n\nA quarter of the way through our meal, an Asian lady was walked to the back room and was sat at a table for a party of 6. So why did she get to sit at the table to wait for  the rest of her party to arrive and I was not allowed? So I guess it was not a policy?\n\nOverall, I give this place a 2 stars. One star for the food, which would have probably tasted better if I didn't feel discriminated, and one star for our waiter who was nice. However; for the money, there are better food and def. better service elsewhere.", "author": "SanDee W."}

The platting was also one of the best i have seen. The food came out fast with many free amuse dishes. However their service was a disappointment. Maybe its due to my age (?) but again I was met with a condescending and rude attitude from my waiter. Anyways this is probably my favorite restaurant in norcal thus far and would gladly go back anytime. Next time i hope the waiter cleans up his act. \n\nThe mock raspberry and blackberry drinks were extremely fresh and delightful. It was not overly sweet and extremely well made. \n\nAmuse similar to Fleur. It basically tastes like a spoonful of 1000000 delicious salads in one bite.  \n\nMy favorite amuse of all 15 Michelin star restaurants i have been too. The black truffle butternut squash soup (?) made inside an egg. It tastes like heaven. \n\nThe bread was nothing special. \n\nThe sweetbreads were the best out of all 15 michelin star restaurants i have dined at. \n\nThe scallops were extremely fresh with no brininess to it. You could taste the scallops natural sweetness.\n\nThe rabbit prepared four ways was good but not mind blowing. It was a bit dry and sometimes lacked seasoning. I would suggest Atlanta's, Canoe restaurant for the best tasting rabbit. \n\nThe Kobe beef was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The portion was fair. \n\nAmuse pallet cleaner was extremely tasty and it did help prepare us for the dessert course. It was made with coconut, lemon and pineapple.  \n\nThe chocolate lava cake was the best i have ever had anywhere. It tasted like a hot rich brownie with melted chocolate inside. On the side there was also brandy poached apples to help you not have a chocolate overload feeling. \n\nTheir fig, fruit gelatin and ice cream was also one of the best desserts i have experienced. \n\nThe petite fours were plain and nothing special. But at this point i didnt care as the desserts before were perfect.", "author": "Andrew W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-28", "description": "There is no doubt in my mind that La Folie ranks among the best food I've eaten in my life.  Came here for a birthday dinner with a friend and had a fabulous meal and evening.\n\nLa Folie can be hard to find unless you know exactly what you're looking for.  It's right on Polk but the entrance is quite muted and not at all large and pretentious.  Opt for the valet parking - don't waste time trying to find parking.  Besides, you don't want your lady friend to be walking around these city blocks dressed to the nines.  \n\nAnd by the way, that means, please make sure you're dressed appropriately... I know this is San Francisco and I applaud the laid-back culture but it's simply not appropriate to be dressed in anything less than slacks and a sportcoat.  \n\nGot seated right away... it didn't seem to be a very busy night (it was a Wednesday so maybe that explains it).\n\nElegant interior, quite well lit but still a very nice ambiance.  The table for 2 was quite spacious and even though it was flanked by a table close by, offered plenty of privacy.\n\nWe both got the 5 course menu with the caviar to start off with.  I told the waitress about my shellfish allergies and she took exquisite care of making sure that everything that ended up before me was free of the allergen.  Service was absolutely impeccable, unintrusive and deserving of all the positive reviews on this page.  \n\nHere then, were the choices we ordered.\n\n- Russian Osetra Caviar served with potato blinis with lobster (salmon for me) and cr\u00e8me fraiche... Delicious... the caviar was perfect, with the right amount of saltiness to offset the really rich cream - the blinis were quite exquisite as well.\n\n- Foie gras soup with truffled crackers - absolutely divine - was also perfect for dipping the wonderful bread they set out.\n\n- Triple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg, on Sweetbreads Pancake, Frangelico Almond Pesto, Wild Mushroom Salad, Truffle Vinaigrette - really good.  The mushroom salad was quite different and tasty.  I enjoyed it very much.\n\n- \"Tasting of Passot Roe\", Sea of Cortez Diver Scallop Ceviche, Hiramasa Yellowtail Sashimi, and Kusshi Oyster - I decided to pass on the scallop and was graciously offered the entire oyster :)  We shared the yellowtail.  The roe was good but the stellar caviar was a hard act to follow.\n\n- Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Caramelized Peaches and Spiced Peach Consomm\u00e9 - this was HUGE - yes, I know - TWSS.  But by God, this was the most generous portion of foie gras I've had in a restaurant.  And it was absolutely decadent -  perfect in every respect.  We were offered shaved black truffles and accepted - a great choice I would heartily recommend.  The foie was one of the stars of the meal.\n\n- Seared Arctic Char, Brentwood Farms Corn Fondue, Sugar Snap Peas, Wild Mushrooms, Bacon Vinaigrette - this turned out to be my least favorite.  It was very good but in retrospect, it might have been better to go four course and skip the fish course.\n\n- Pan Seared Daurade , on Proven\u00e7ale Vegetables, Lobster Stuffed Squash Blossoms, Uni Broth - again, they took great care to avoid the lobster touching the fish so I could enjoy it as well.  Good but like the char, this would be something I'd leave out in the future.\n\n- Trio of Rabbit (Loin, Rack and Braised Leg) with Baby Vegetables, Roasted Garlic, Natural Jus - beautiful presentation, great taste.  Did not taste as gamey as rabbit sometimes tends to do...  there was a lot of food yet to come so some of this ended up in a take-home container.\n\n- \"Le Boeuf\", Creekstone Beef Tenderloin, Braised Beef Short Rib, and Burger Rossini with Sauce Bordelaise - We got this with the wagyu beef instead of the regular and it was the best choice!!!  The beef was cooked medium rare and was perfect.  The little burger was, oh so cute :) and tasty to top it!!!  And the shave black truffle option was a winner for this course.  5 stars :)\n\n- Peanut Butter Opera Cake, Chocolate-Peanut Butter and Caramel Mousses, Curry Ice Cream - the curry ice cream was quite the surprise and the cake was delicious, moist and chewy but not overwhelming in its sweetness.  The salty edge was perceivable and added to the taste.\n\n- Organic Strawberries and Valrhona Chocolate Bread Pudding, Basil-Olive Oil Ice Cream, Champagne Sabayon - really excellent bread pudding.  Quite a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nI had the wine pairing and the sommelier did a fantastic job pairing my courses with some great wines.  \n\nThe chef kept sending out different interesting amuse bouches during the meal... some divine tuna tartare, an interesting egg concoction and a strawberry puree just before dessert.  \n\nAfter 4 and a half wonderful hours with magnificent food that was always presented beautifully, we finally finished with a plate of petit fours - stuffed to the gills!!!\n\n~ 5 stars overall - Great service, a perfect meal and a perfect evening.  La Folie did not disappoint in any aspect and I will definitely be back for more.  Happy Birthday :)\n\n# 250", "author": "Badri N."}

Admittedly, being a San Diegan, this is the first time I felt I needed to dress up to dinner, but...I liked that.  Reservations were set for 5:30pm, Tuesday, the best time I could get in such a short notice.  It wasn't too bad though, as it allowed me to grab street parking a step outside the restaurant, saving me a valet.  \n\nThe restaurant may not look like much from outside, but after a door and coat check, you enter into chef Roland Passot's culinary gem.  The staff are pleasant and kind, serving and answering questions without seeming pretentious or overbearing.  Water is refilled and plates taken right on cue, without anyone's annoying hovering or needing to being asked to.  \n\nMy friend and I elected for three courses each, skipping dessert and secretly hoping that they'd serve something for her birthday.  But it's the details that made this restaurant charming: the thin glass cups, the truffles that they bring around and let you smell, the view of the kitchen while you wait for the restroom (or linger), as you can simply look in and watch the art unfold.  \n\nDinner started off with cocktails, bread, and two mini courses, La Folie's amuse bouches:\n\nSalmon Mousse with Cauliflower Crisp and Fried Capers: a lovely bite.  Small, but wonderfully prepared.\n\nTriple T Ranch Egg Truffle Soup with a Fried Potato Crisp and Toasted Brioche: This set the mood for the night.  Presentation, execution, flavor.  The egg was silky, and the plate it was served in - made specifically to hold an egg - made it even more enchanting.  \n\nIn retrospect, I wish I had tried the saut\u00e9ed Burgundy snails and warmed pigs feet, courses I may never have opportunity to again taste.  Luckily though, I did indulge in a few new foods: foie gras, duck egg and rabbit.  And just to note: three courses is probably plenty.\n\n\"Tasting of Passat Roe\": Sea of Cortez Diver Scallop Ceviche, Hiramasa Yellowtail Sashimi, and Kusshi Oyster: Amazing.  Fresh, delicate presentation, with a healthy portion of roe.  I loved it.\n\nButter Poached Lobster, on English Pea Ravioli with Truffle Beurre Fondue, and Marcona Almond Salad: I'm not usually a fan of salads, but the lobster on ravioli was heavenly.  The flavors worked so well together, and the lobster I believe to be the best I've yet eaten.\n\nTrio of Rabbit (Loin, Rack and Braised Leg) with Baby Vegetables, Roasted Garlic, Natural Jus: My first taste of rabbit, and I've mixed feelings.  The loin I couldn't find myself liking - it was chewy and a bit bland.  The rack was easily my favorite piece, unfortunate only in its very small size, but it had an amazing taste and texture.  The mushroom stuffed braised leg was good, but I was getting full by the time I started cutting into it.  And the baby vegetables?  Cooked perfectly.\n\nIn between each course, a server comes and sets the table for the next course, bringing out fresh utensils specific to the type of food you're about to eat.  So, imagine the two of us, finishing our third course, given a to-go box of the leftovers, and placed with yet another set of utensils.  I had told the reservationist that it would be the lady's birthday, and La Folie did not disappoint.  Two pieces each of four different sweets came out on a plate, a lit candle and a sliver of chocolate saying \"happy birthday\". And this would be the perfect end to the meal, had it not been for the chef personally coming out to thank us and wishing my friend happy birthday, again.  \n\nLeaving the restaurant and standing on the street discussing what was next, we bumped into the chef again, who not only remembered us, but wished a happy birthday for a third time.  Details and presentation.  La Folie has it down.  Solid 4.5.", "author": "Christopher P."}

He obviously liked it since he devoured it.

I had enough for the dessert! \n\nMy new favorite restaurant! It's not what pretentious at all! Don't believe the stereotype!

The lobster proved to be a bit of a distraction from the caviar, so my wife ate it separately.  Probably the right decision.  \n\nFor starters, I had the sauteed burgundy snails in pernod lemon butter, with fried parsely on top and bone marrow gratin.  Delightful!

But that's not what this was -- the sauce focused the tongue on the snails, but it wasn't oily or heavy like butter, and still a delightful way to get rid of some table bread :)\n\nShannan had the butter-poached lobster with english pea ravioli, spring salad with almonds, and nantaise carrot sauce.  Their first attempt at this was a little bit chewy, which was surprising.  We sent it back (seriously, if there's one thing you should take from my reviews is: If you're not happy at a good restaurant, send it back.  They'll thank you for it) and they redid it, noting they thought the first version was a little over-stressed.  The second lobster was quite delightful -- exactly what we'd have hoped for.  The contrast between the buttery lobster and the crispy, acidy, spring salad woke both of these flavors up.\n\nFor our main course, I had the seared beef tenderloin, medium-rare.  It was not the best steak I've ever had.  The best steak I've ever had was the Wagyu ribeye I had at La Folie a year ago, at a $75 surcharge.  This steak, however, was the best steak for which I've not had to mortgage my house.  It was seared perfectly, with a crispy salty edge; but inside is where it shone, where it was tender, and almost melted in your mouth.  I was full and couldn't finish it at this point, but took the last bite or two home, because there was no way in hell I was not going to get to finish this steak one way or another.  Amazing.\n\nShannan had the roti of quail and squab, stuffed with miled mushrooms and wrapped in crispy potato strings, with truffled jus.  Whereas my steak was tender, tasty, and mild, hers was a bold assault on your mouth -- the sort of attack you'd welcome with open arms.  The truffles, coupled with the mushrooms, made their presence clear, as well as the crunchy exterior of the birds.  It was a delightful, brash, dish.  Very different from my steak, of course, but ... I'd be hard pressed to say which was better.\n\nFor dessert, she had the baked alaska, on which I wrote last year and remains absolutely delightful.  I had the Edam Cheese Souffle, with fromage blanc sorbet, crispy bacon, and white sesame tuile.  And man oh man ... it made me laugh.  Dessert, certainly, but imagine bacon and eggs made into a dessert.  It was a delightful, quirky, and unusual flavor palette that I've never seen in a dessert before, but I'd be happy to see again.\n\nNot exactly the sort of place I'd go to monthly -- not on my salary, at least -- but for special occasions? La Folie continues to blow our socks off.", "author": "Roy R."}

You can mix and match your meal in 3, 4 or 5 courses or have the 4-course set menu with optional wine tastings. I had the ultra lovely seared foie gras - I'm a fairly recent convert (too bad since it will be outlawed starting next year in CA), and I've tried foie gras at a few places now. I have to say La Folie's version of it is TOPS!! So filling, creamy smooth - I almost wish I didn't have it at the beginning of my meal because everything else was tasty and lovely but sort of anticlimactic because the foie gras overpowered, outshined everything - I couldn't see straight anymore! ;) I had it along with a nice glass of champagne Brut. Mmmm. \n\nAfter the foie gras, I couldn't make up my mind between the black cod or the buttered lobster for my next course - so I got both as my 2nd and 3rd course, choosing the buttered lobster as my main course. The black cod was so nicely cooked and flavorful, just crispy enough - mmm! But then I was so full by the time my lobster came around, I took a couple bites and had to pack it up. It was actually really good as leftovers - mmmmm! :) And last but not least, my friend ordered the huckleberry baked alaska - nice cap to the meal. \n\nThe only downsides to the meal were my viognier was just ok, and I didn't like that I had to put my credit card down to make a reservation - if I didn't cancel/change within 24 hours, I would've been charged something like $50. Talk about pressure! Of course, we kept our reservation and there were no problems, but still, I would like to make my reservations freely. Life is life, sometimes things come up, and dealing with an extra charge if needed is not fun. \n\nBut I digress -- all in all, my friend and I had an ultra lovely meal in a nice, non-snooty dining environment that was easy, casual yet classy, and it was a great place for us to catch up on all the latest. The service was very patient and explained the menu so nicely. I would definitely come back in a heartbeat!", "author": "Maile N."}

Wow. Really. \n\nHowever, the pork-feet-lobster-sweetbread thingy was salty and not for me. The rabbit done N-ways was also salty and on the dry side.

This time I came here for my bday dinner with my husband.  This is one of the best French restaurants in the city and the chef is actually cooking there every night unlike some others.  This place is small, intimate and elegant in a very simple way, although the chairs could be replaced, the ones we had were rubbed down.  Also on a cold night the tables right in the line of the doorway are cold due to the breeze.  \n\nWe decided to do the 3 course tasting menu and then see if we could eat more.  Wow the food was amazing and the courses were quite large, we couldn't even order dessert.  We had the scallops, lobster, foie grass, steak, rabbit, and frog legs.  Everything was absolutely amazing, executed beautifully and while the flavors were complex they all just complemented each other and danced in our mouths.  The foie grass was huge and yes I signed the petition to keep in around, while I support humane treatment of animals, I also don't like someone telling me what to do or eat.  \n\nThe dinner took a while, which is want we wanted so we could talk, enjoy our bottle of wine and the whole experience.\n\nOne thing I will say, the service while attentive was a bit too casual, compared to Gary Danko.

The poor guy was pretty uncomfortable. She even asked him if he fancied shopping himself. He had nothing else to answer rather than to shrug his shoulders and confess he could not afford to do so. \n\nBack to the food.\n\nSo we ordered to start some black caviar which was delicious. Little lavish treats like these I find to be absurd, but this one was actually very tasty.\n\nI ordered the complete seasonal menu and she ordered the five course menu. \n\nAmongst everything was a couple of overcooked lobsters, some snails inside some animal's bone, rabbit (which was great), quail (which was also really good), and the rest were a bunch of fancy creations of the chef that looked artistic and so forth but tasted alright. For example the frog legs, which were nice, but the smelly flan next to it, was not so good. A raw egg yolk mixed with carrot, was something I could do myself, but probably wouldn't because eggs taste better when they're cooked. \n\nThe result was paying 350 dollars for a hilarious experience yet the food was nothing spectacular.", "author": "Daniel S."}

I read Rita Y.'s review of La Folie a year ago and knew that I had to try this French establishment. I expected the food and service to be exceptional, since this restaurant is $$$$ but it exceeded my expectations. After so many years of being my eating partner in crime, my girlfriend deserved a little something extra special for our anniversary. \n\nDriving to Russian Hill, we could not find the restaurant because my iPhone GPS was have technical difficulties. Luckily we landed parking very quickly and used my super acute vision to locate the restaurant. We actually stepped into the lounge half of La Folie, which has a modern French feel and comfortable seating. Upon realizing this, we walked next door to the actual restaurant, which also has comfortable seating and dim lighting for that romantic atmosphere.\n\nLooking at the menu, I knew that I wanted to get two 5 course menus, even if my stomach did not have the capacity for it. I needed to try as much food as possible. Here goes:\n\nTriple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg - egg still had the nice runny yolk\nDungeness Crab Salad - pea panna cotta was interesting but not a memorable dish\nBurgundry Snails - loved digging for the snails in the bone marrow\nPig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine - nicely cooked and had a lobster surprise\nButter Poached Lobster - more delicious lobster in an amazing butter sauce\nLobster and Mushroom Risotto - first time trying risotto and I love it\nRoti of Quail and Squab - too gamey for me but loved the accompanying sauce\nLe Boeuf - tenderloin, short rib, and a burger each with its own distinct flavor\nEdman Cheese Souffle - girlfriend who does not like souffle ate the entire thing\n\"The Sunset\" Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant - dark chocolate lovers must try\n\nReceived the Triple T Ranch Egg Amuse Bouche, which was beautiful to look at and tasted amazing as well. Also got another amuse bouche, which was a nice balance between salty and sweet and an icy, refreshing palate cleanser. And the final Petit Fours ended the meal on the perfect note.The presentations of the dishes were beautiful and visually stunning. For every dish and portions were the perfect size. The sauces were rich but never overpowered the food and my stomach did not feel too heavy at the end of the meal. Hands down the best restaurant I have been to in SF so far, including Gary Danko and Boulevard. Thank you eating partner for being up to the five course eating extravaganza.\n\nService was also fantastic. Glasses were always filled and a piping hot individually-sized baguette was always present. Empty plates were taken away promptly and everyone was so courteous and friendly. Only complaint was the slow pacing of the food. I felt like I was always waiting for the next dish to come out, but then again I do eat fast. \n\nWhat I recommend:\n-- loved everything but would order Le Boeuf over and over again\n-- residential parking has two hour limit, Monday through Saturday, with a plethora of meter maids patrolling the area and marking up tires so either go after 6pm to park for free at the parking meters or move your car every two hours", "author": "Andrew W."}

After eating all that rich foie, though, I needed something to keep up with the richness of that foie.  I actually enjoyed some of the other entrees more, especially the squab and quail dish.\n\nThe desserts were surprisingly light and not overwhelmingly rich.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-27", "description": "Y'all know me, still the same old G, and keeping it real, the 4.5 stars don't phaze me. We booked La Folie because we (three of us) wanted to preserve a memory at GD and wanted to find a comprable restaurant-- so we Yelped. And I love the name. I don't know what it means-- I assume something like folly or \"love to the point of madness\" (okay I looked that up). \n\nLast minute, we decided to go to GD anyway. I tried to cancel La Folie resos and found out I had reserved with a credit card and the penalty was $80 a head. Hmmm... I can sort of understand it. After all, I agreed to it. But I prefer to have this kind of policy ONLY if the restaurant is super popular, always packed, always in demand. In short, I don't want to feel \"held hostage\" to eat. Regardless, we thought it'd be fun to go anyway and compare the two (with a day to rest in between). \n\nOverall, I thought the strongest points of La Folie was the service and the pace of the meal. This is just so important and while it may feel like an intangible to the diner, it is without a doubt an art that a restaurant must perfect. I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out. But possibly, even worse, I don't want to feel like I've been eating for 5 hours. La Folie has this DOWN. \n\nNow let's go down. Downtown. Food awesomeness to price ratio. I'm not gonna lie, I'm sorta ballin' right now so we went all out. GF doesn't drink alcohol? Mocktail son. Two cokes and two sprites at $4 (per glass: outrageous no refill policy, don't nickel and dime me when it is $150 a head) -- no big deal. Special supplement of truffle shavings on a dish for $20 per dish? Let's do it. All three risotto dishes. But the food fell wayyy short. \n\nFirst dish: Something Passing Through Something. Which consisted of a lot of roe/caviar-- on an oyster, on a seaweed salad thing, on farm raised hamachi aka kampachi. I just didn't enjoy the course, felt it was too crude, too thrown together. A bit of a mess. Like what's the point of this? Is the dish being tied together because all of them have roe on them? Sorry if I'm trying to sound like Tom C. \n\nSecond dish: Lobster risotto w/ black truffle shaving supplement. Um...tasty, I guess? It was a good dish but again, lacked that delicate touch. In fact, it was a different kind of mess: too, too, too many components. I wouldn't say no to risotto, rice, mushroom, truffle, lobster. But this had peas, asparagus, all kinds of things in it. It was like eating risotto stir fry. Black truffle shaving made zero taste difference as far as I could taste. \n\nThird dish: Duck breast. By far the best dish of 9 dishes (though my gf's asparagus soup looked pretty good). I was about to throw a shit fit when the waiter needed to check to see if there was still duck. It is Tuesday. Our reso was at 8:00. How do you run out of something? Also this was back to the \"held hostage\" situation so if they had run out of duck, I was ready to go to war. But instead, I got easily the best dish of the night (and arguably of the GD 3 courses two nights prior as well). Just brilliantly cooked, simple, and that's when food is awesome-- when depth is created through simplicity and not a bunch of crazy \"creative\" stuff. \n\nDessert: I forgot to mention that the portions are just enormous here so we canceled the baked alaska (something I always read in The Boxcar Children or something and wanted to try) and got some really impractical dessert to share. Bunch of ice creams, jellies, panna cottas, lol...like many other dishes, it was a mess and even a bigger mess to share. \n\nOther thoughts: 1 unisex bathroom. GTFO. Get another bathroom. Men and women lining up to get into the bathroom. Strong touch-- chef coming out and talking to all of us, every table. Chef admitting the truffles aren't really in full season and if they were it wouldn't be a $20 supplement (I asked how much would it be if I stole the enormous black truffle sitting behind me). \n\nApologies: I was WRONGLY informed that tax was 10% and didn't want to leave a dime over 15% (not that our waiter sucked but he was really absent sometimes and I think running between our table and the restaurant/lounge next door?) So whatev, my b, bruh. \n\nService: 3 stars\nPacing: 5 stars (considering the $, this should be a given though)\nFood: 2.5 stars  \nValue: 2 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars\n\nOverall, not a bad restaurant. Cozy. But with so many other options and an inevitably huge bill + the reservation and soda thing, it'd be madness (or folly, har har har) if I didn't have my first and last meal at La Folie.", "author": "David C."}

Frankly, I haven't been that impressed by the nouveau cuisine.  They've involved interesting combinations of flavors and ingredients that I've sometimes never heard of before.  Too often, it's not as tasty as the price would have you believe.  However, La Folie served us a bunch of dishes that were excellent and very unique.  \n\nThe $15 valet parking was a must here as street parking availability is laughable.  The restaurant itself isn't all that big, but it has a nice high ceiling, subdued lighting, dark colors and mirrors.  Very sophisticated.  Service was excellent. \n\nThe tables were kind of close together, but I've seen a lot worse.  You really couldn't hear the next table unless you paid attention.  \n\nThey have a fixed price menu or you can choose three dishes for about $90.  Or four dishes for more money.  \n\nAfter we ordered, we were served with a couple of small complementary appetizers.  Frankly, I don't know what we had, but it sure tasted good.  I like it when these restaurants serve you some freebies since it's so expensive to dine here.  \n\nMy octopus salad was very tasty.  Not sure what the ingredients were in this salad, but I really liked it.  My second course was my lamb chops.  Excellent.  Despite the super formal surroundings, I just had to chew the meat right off the bone.  Finally, I had the Baked Alaska.  Great.  \n\nThe owner came by to ask us how everything was for the evening.  He even stopped to talk for a bit.  Nice touch.

About 25 minutes later they came to inform us that the table was ready. We took our drinks with us but it turned out we had to settle the bill for the drinks first. (I was frustrated but it turned out financially it was a good idea - the same cocktails at the restaurant are about 60% more than in the lounge area.) \n\nThe main sitting area of the restaurant looked OK but we were sited in a stuffy room in  the back that looked more like a closed with dark green painted walls and a wine cooling stand prompting the door open and an large metallic fan under a side table by the wall to move the air somewhat. Not exactly inviting nor expected sitting area for such a restaurant. ... If you can choose - choose to stain the main sitting area - it looked a lot more appealing. \n\nThe presentation of the food was OK.  The deserts and the frog legs were really good. I would recommend the chocolate moos to anyone (just skip the tasteless spongy substance that comes with it). The rest of the food was nothing to write home about. \n\nI had a rabbit, which was cooked OK completely tasteless. There was a small piece of rabbit liver in the plate, which had a nice flavor to it and the steamed carrots were tasty too. The rest was rather bland and I could not go through even half of it. \n\nMy wife had the risotto, which looked more like a rice soup on consistency. I guess one would wonder why there would be a risotto in a French restaurant in the first place but if on the menu it should be good. \n\nThe service was OK. I like it when the food is explained but the ongoing instructions on how to consume the food and the waiter pausing a bit at the table as if to see if you would grab the frog leg with fingers as you were instructed was somewhat annoying. My wife and I enjoy eating our food and having someone on our heads telling us how to do it (wrongly at times) spoils the fun. I have not removed any stars for the service though. \n\nI must give the Chef credit though. When he was doing his rounds and asked if we liked everything and I told him we did not he did not say a word but later we were told that he had removed the rabbit from the bill. Now really for a high-end restaurant like this one pretends to be returning a mostly untouched plate should have triggered questions and attention right on the spot - at least by my experience - but nevertheless at least we did not have to pay for the rabbit. \n\nAll in all I do not know how the La Folie ended up in the SF Top 100 restaurants but it is insane to keep it there - it does not belong.

There being four of us, we got to sample a wide variety of the dishes on the menu and everything was fabulous BUT the definite standouts were: the asparagus and green garlic soup w/lobster, the seared fois gras (HUGE portion and perfectly seared), the butter poached lobster w/asparagus ravioli and the kobe beef (divine but it should be at a $60 upgrade). \n\nDessert was equaly fabulous with the standouts being the cheese souffle (yes, it is dessert!) and the chocolate bread pudding with the basil-olive oil ice cream (amazing!). \n\nThe service was impeccable and the meal was timed perfectly. One thing of note I found interesting is that we were under the impression that this was a 'jacket required' restaurant but when we got there they asked to take my boyfriend's jacket so he was just in his dress shirt for dinner.

There's a tasting menu available ($115) or you can opt for a specific # of courses for a flat $ and you get to choose your exact dishes (example: 3 course $85, 4 course $95, 5 course $105). \n\nMany people on yelp complain about 5 courses being too much but I was sure to eat light during the day to ensure I can yum up all that was served to me. I felt the portions were perfectly sized and on the larger side for a fine dining location and paced myself perfectly as by the end of the meal I was indeed stuffed. \n\nAll of the dishes that I chose had varying complexities whether it was contrasts in textures, notes, temp, etc and I really appreciated the meal for that reason. They do bring out 2 amuse bouches before your meal begins and 1 before the transition into dessert (total of 3 bites). \n\nI went with the dungeoness crab salad, tasting of passot roe, lobster and scallop over squid ink spaghetti, trio of rabbit, and their famous baked alaska. \n\nAll were a score of 10. \n\nThe dungeoness crab salad had a surprisingly good portion of the crab (as most places would opt to skimp) and was balanced nicely with an avocado puree of sorts and a rice cracker for contrasting texture. Divine! \n\nTasting of passot roe was a trio of roe with varying infusions (vanilla truffle, brandy, and khafir) paired with a coconut scallop ceviche, hamachi sashimi and oyster on the half shell over a wonderful medley of seaweed salad and ginger. The seaweed salad seems like it would be the supporting role but in my opinion was the foundation of the dish and really tied everything together. I just wanted more!\n\nSquid Ink Spaghetti... I was so excited for this dish because it was supposed to have uni in it (per my research online/past menu displays) and according to my menu, uni was specified to be included. I realized when the dish came however, no uni was to be found. I called the waitress over and apparently they didnt have any uni that night and it shouldnt have been on the menu. She was extremely nice about it and offered to make it up to me. [Expect a review on the cheese plate later down my elaborate review]. Nonetheless, the lobster and scallop was seared and on a bed of squid ink pasta with a lobster foam. The lobster and scallop were perfectly cooked. The pasta, in my opinion, was a bit too al dente than I would have liked but maybe it was intended that way so I kept working through it. The scallop paired nicely with everything but my oh my, the lobster sang musical notes every bite I had with it as it really was the star of the dish. Bravo!\n\nThe trio of rabbit was wonderfully scattered in what seemed to be a medley of a vegetable field. Roasted vegetables to be exact. The trio consisted of a wrapped rabbit with veggies, rabbit leg, rabbit liver, and rack of rabbit. It was all very good.\n\nThe cheese plate came and it had honeycomb on it, goats cheese, sheep's cheese, and an apple tart puree of some sort. Some of the best cheese I have had and was happy to have missed the uni for this. \n\nThe baked alaska was great -- better than any I have ever had. I only had room for a few bites but was quite pleased with the few I did. \n\nAll in all the food was spectacular! I knocked off one star however for the lack of decor and underwhelming experience in the back dining room. The front of the house is really loud and vibrant but unfortunately we were positioned to dine in the back room where it had green and purple wallpaper (very barney-esque) and a much softer decibel. When the bf and I came in, we literally were whispering because it was so quiet. Also, the lounge seemed to be right outside one of the walls in the room because throughout my entire meal i head screaming and loud music. When that wasnt distracting me, I would hear dishes banging around and washing going on on the other wall behind me. It really took away from my experience and was an annoyance throughout the entire meal. For such a nice place, I would expect the  ambiance to be flawless and for that reason, I have only 4 stars to give. \n\nNext time I come back i'll be requesting the front room for sure.", "author": "Lauren Y."}

The server even filled us in as to why there were different spoons for the risotto dish - we were curious. \n\nFood - \nThe first amuse was a tuna with caviar which was good but didn't wow me. Nor did the second amuse, which was soup served in an egg with an egg yolk inside. The soup was semi flavorful but once you broke the yolk, it became very bland. \n*Poached Octopus with Uni Salad - I was super excited to try this dish and was again, underwhelmed. I felt like all the components were there - great octopus, uni, and specks of caviar but somehow it just lacked flavor. I expected more from the dashi gelee, hoping it would be the one to tie all the flavors together but it merely added an uncomfortable slippery texture. \n*Triple T Tempura Duck Egg - I love truffle and this dish was laden with it which was a plus but it was under-seasoned. \n*Lobster and Mushroom Risotto - this was the saving grace of the night. The risotto was perfectly creamy and delicious with chunks of lobster and mushroom. I could have eaten 3 more bowls of it!\n*Lamb Chops - BF ordered and thought it was good.\n*Duck - I came here specifically for the duck and it had its highs and lows. The duck breast was cooked perfectly and paired with the crispy specks (of rice?) was delicious. The other preparation of duck was a little too overdone for me and was simply bland. The side of haricot vert and peach was also lacking in flavor and creativity. \n*Baked Alaska - way too sweet.\n\nMaybe it was me, maybe it was LF but overall a very meh expensive dinner.", "author": "Jamie M."}

This is a lovely place where I had caviar for the first time. Since it was Valentine's day, they had a prixe fix 5-course menu titled, \"Love box\", priced at $180/person. We added on the half ounce of Russian Osetra Caviar served with Potato Blinis with Lobster & Creme Fraiche and of course champagne. This was my first time having caviar and let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS!!!!! We enjoyed it so much that we wished we had ordered the full ounce. We had ordered one glass of champagne and asked to split into two, but our waiter was nice & gave us each a full glass. \n\nWe ordered one wine pairing ($100) and split. I loved how each course had a love themed title:\n\n1st: \"First Blush\"\nAhi Tuna Tartare and Abalone Salad \nCucumber Yuzu Gelee, \"Sea Foam\"\nPretty good, but wished there was just a dash more of salt and 'sea foam'. Liked the hint of citrus from the yuzu.\n\n2nd: \"Filtre D'Amour\"\nAsparagus soup\nLobster, House Smoked Salmon, Mini Gougeres\nHunny was really excited for me to see how they pour the asparagus soup beautifully over the lobster, house smoked salmon and mini gougeres. He was disappointed that they server just plopped it onto the seafood. Nonetheless, it was good. I loved the bites when I would get the lobster and smoked salmon...it had such a beautiful flavor. However, the asparagus soup alone was just ok. Definitely meant to be eaten soup + lobster + smoke salmon + mini gougeres in each bite. \n\n3rd: \"Love Connection\"\nPan Seared Black Cod\nButter Beans with Bacon, Sunchoke puree, Brown Butter Jus\nI enjoyed this dish. Very nice portion of well prepared cod. Yummy. I loved the bacon bits which gave it a nice hint of saltiness along with the sunchoke puree.

Risotto was nice and creamy and truffles...well you know...just delicious. The squab was so tender and delciously made.\nMe: Kobe Wagyu, Bearnaise Croquette, Bone Marrow Custard, Bordelaise sauce\nMY FAVORITE (besides the caviar :P) Ordered this medium rare, but I think it may have been even better if ordered rare. Croquettes gave it a nice crunchy texture and the bone marrow was this beautiful soft custard. \n\n5th: \"Le Desir\" \nPeanut Butter Opera Cake\nCaramel Mousse, Biscuit Jaconde, Hibiscus Sorbet, Peanut Butter Powder Vacherin\nOh this was just dreamy and a beautiful balance of sweetness. The caramel mousse and hibiscus sorbet were to die for. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't remember the wines we had, but I do remember the Champagne, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc and Dessert Wine were my faves. \n\nService: We had a wonderful experience with our server and the front of the house of La Folie. \n\nOverall, we had a lovely and romantic evening at La Folie and I would love to come back!", "author": "Grace R."}

Another cool aspect about selecting your meal -- when choosing the dishes you want for your four courses you can choose any number of items from any section of the menu save for the meat/poultry section.

I've been to many famous French restaurants in San Francisco: L'ardoise Bistro, Chapeau!, Chez Maman, Olea etc. Most of them are way cheaper but the food is at least at bar with La Folie and some of them are even better.\n\nLet me tell you what I had that night for $300+/per person deal\n\nLobster soup: quite unmemorable. I didn't even feel 'wow, it's great', let alone calling it amazing. \n\nDuck: it's tender and okay tasting. The best dish of the night I guess. \n\nKobe beef (+$75 option): some parts were burnt, I think it's not acceptable mistake at this price and overall it wasn't tender/tasting. I've tried many kobe beef dishes and it's definitely one below average.\n\nDessert: sorry I don't even remember what was the dessert. I only remember it was so sweet and not-balanced that we didn't even finish it.  As a french dessert lover, it seldom happened to me. I was so disappointed when a french restaurant can't even get the desserts right.\n\n\nOn the service side: awful\n\nWe've PREPAID and made reservation but when I got to the place, they asked me to stand by the counter and refused to seat me before my boyfriend arrived. Let's be straight, it's not a $ restaurant who aims on turning-table rate. We've prepaid and secured the table for the night, why do you refuse to seat me at all? \n\nIt was a ~$700 dinner and I was refused to be seated for 15 minutes. RIDICULOUS. Also, the tables were super close to each other and hard to have a nice romantic conversation.   \n\nThe same level restaurant: Aziza, Michael Mina etc. all did a way better job on this. \n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you have the budget of $500+ dining in San Francisco. Try Saison which is pretty decent and fun! The place is also more spacious and good for conversation. If you can go further, try any restaurants in Yountville that would satisfy you way more.\n\nI feel so sorry that we went to this restaurant for Valentine's dinner and that totally ruined the night.", "author": "Frost L."}

I live in San Diego, where there's plenty of good food but few places to DINE; thus, La Folie is a breath of fresh (but rarified) air.  Dim lighting, heavy curtains, flickering (though sadly fake) candles, tuxedoed servers, diners with tucked in shirts and no denim in sight - what a refreshing change.\n\nLa Folie offers three courses for $85, four for $95, or five for $105, with the proviso that only one meat selection is permitted (which makes sense.)  You and your fellow diners should opt for the same number of courses - the restaurant doesn't require this, but the table next to ours had three diners, two of whom ordered four courses, and one of whom ordered three.  At one point, the three course diner sort of sat there with nothing to do while her companions dove into their fish course.  It looked weird, but if you don't mind, the restaurant doesn't mind.  A five course tasting menu is also offered but I find tasting menus too constricting.\n\nWe started with two amuse bouches - one a micro-sardine on a wafer-thin cracker, the other an egg yolk \"soup\" served in the shell.  Both were perfect palette warmers and offered insight into La Folie's food sensibilities: precise and formal, but with a hint of whimsy and a nod to showmanship.\n\nMy wife and I ordered, respectively, the crab and peach salad, salmon, and coconut tapioca, and the escargots, lobster risotto and blueberry baked Alaska.  Each dish was artfully presented and precisely executed.  The lobster and mushroom risotto, in particular, was stellar: rich and earthy, no skimping on fat chunks of lobster.  The baked Alaska is the signature dessert, and it did not disappoint (light as a feather meringue smothering a crisp blueberry biscuit and bracing lemon verbena ice cream.)  Petit fours (eight for two people - fruit gelee, dark  chocolate, petit madeline and one that escapes me) at the end of the meal were entirely unnecessary but a thoughtful gesture.\n\nService was flawless - our server offered honest advice when solicited, and was gracious through the entire meal.

For those of you who never had the opportunity to experience FLEUR de LYS or what I deemed, FRENCH DINING at its very best, I openly weep for you. The CUISINE literally danced on the palate and the presentations were a feast for the eyes.\n\n Based on reviews of LA FOLIE, I made reservations for 4 at the beginning of February for February 21, 6;30  was the assigned time. My wife is a vegetarian and so having a pre-planned vegetarian menu was a must. I was assured that a complete vegetarian menu existed; impressive, I thought.. Credit card information was required and given along with full attention to the policies for cancellation--$90.00 per person unless a 48 hour notice was  provided--with such strict requirements, I assumed all was in place. On the 21st, we arrived promptly at 6:30 only to find out that  no reservations had been recorded at all. Staff began to scramble and make excuses, my party embarrassed, stood in the tiny entrance not knowing exactly what to do. The manager was summoned, he came and  assure us that the situation would be handled quickly. Some arrangements were  made to accommodate the oversight;  I, however, immediately  viewed this over-sight as an ill omen of all that was yet to come.  Especially since no constellation was extended for the mistake, no veneer of civility. Not at all a savoir faire moment.\n\nSimply put,  LA FOLIE, from the very beginning, failed to impress on every level. The dining area was small but not intimate, expensive but short on Excellence, presentations were fairly  nice but certainly not TOP DRAWER.  We had the 4 course tasting menu which included the FOIE GRAS--rather delicious with the balsamic reduction. The other items however lacked consistency and simply did not intrigue the palate. I personally ordered the rack of Lamb and expected it to be presented as a rack and not a hunk or wad of meat on the plate.  The beauty of a RACK OF LAMB is in its FRENCH PREP. No CHOCOLATE OR GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLES on the MENU, are you kidding me. A small cheese souffle with bacon bits was offered instead. How very disappointing, how very un-French. The vegetarian dishes were also a great disappoint. They lacked creativity and  commitment. Nothing to excite the vegetarian diner.\n\nAlthough our tab including tip was over $700.00; the food (note I did not say cuisine), service and ambiance however were poorly represented and certainly not on par with the cost. We would never consider going again The experience was an absolute disappointment. NOT AT ALL IMPRESSIVE FOR HIGH END FRENCH DINING.", "author": "Audra V K."}

And as soon as you enter, the attention and service from the wait staff is friendly and pleasant (they also have coat check). Their food was very well prepared and well thought out. Mostly everything we tried had lots of flavor, and presentation was very elegant. The food is not necessarily healthy, but it is french cuisine and it was a fun/decadent experience with lots of fun experimental combinations of food to try. \n\nThey also add optional truffles to their dishes that we got to taste test and their wine list is high quality. At the end of the meal, they brought out petit fours as a birthday dessert surprise and the chef personally came out to speak to us about his passion for cooking. \n\nIt is a pretty small intimate restaurant, so it's best to come in a small group of 2-4. Expect to be seated very near the next table (we were practically in their conversation). Definitely come well dressed and bring a healthy appetite!", "author": "Mancy M."}

Very big portion for fine dining, and the food did not feel as \"fine\". Our foie gras was overcooked and the food was very oily. They all look better in pictures and had a mediocre taste. I don't know how they got a Michelin star rating. There was also a big group beside us, and they were literally shouting and talking very loudly, but none of the servers said anything. Service was attentive but felt rehearsed. Would not return.", "author": "Jane W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-26", "description": "We were underwhelmed.  I'd say the food was close to 4 stars (very good, but not outstanding and not quite what I expected for this price point) but the service and atmosphere really brought down the whole experience.  The night started off badly with the valet demanding $15 cash up front as if we were criminals who would try to skip out without paying.  I've never been to a nice restaurant where you couldn't add the valet to the bill.   I don't carry cash but fortunately my husband had some.  We walked in the restaurant into an extremely chaotic atmosphere.  One person asked our name and started to look up the reservation before getting distracted and leaving us to another person who started over by asking our name again.  The hostess then led us to our table but turned away before we were even seated.   I don't insist upon stuffy, formal service but this really came across as rude and was a terrible first impression.\n\nThe atmosphere of the dining room was awful.   The tables are all crammed together and it felt very crowded and like we didn't have enough space.   Definitely not a romantic place because you will have no privacy.  At one point I accidentally elbowed a waiter in the side because we were in such close quarters.  The tables are also all slightly askew, which bothered my OCD tendencies.  Our table was not at a 90 degree angle with the pole it was up against, and the table \"next\" to ours was at least 6\" misaligned with ours.  Minor details sure, but it made the dining room look sloppy.  There is one unisex bathroom and it is pretty gross, also not something you expect in a place like this. Also, there was another diner who had a baby that cried regularly through our entire meal.  I know this is not the restaurant's fault but it was still a detraction.   Seriously, who would bring a baby to a place like this?  If you can afford to dine here you can obviously afford to hire a babysitter for a few hours. \n\nOur waitress was nice but very stiff, reciting the specials to us as if she was reading lines in a play (badly).  I overheard some of the other waiters and they sounded a bit more natural.  For foie gras lovers, they offered the banned delicacy as a special appetizer for $60.  \n\n3 courses for $80/4 for $90/5 for $100.  Only a couple of the (meat) courses had supplements, which I appreciated.   I hate when you are already paying so much and then every lobster/beef/souffle dish is a additional supplement.  The meat & poultry courses are designed to be the main course and are bigger but since I am largely a pescetarian and was having a seafood course as my main, they made that one big which was nice.   We were full but not disgustingly stuffed after 4 courses.\n\n1st amuse: Oxtail & beef topped with horseradish (http://tinyurl.com/am4ohr3).  My husband said it was ok.\n\n2nd amuse: Egg slow poached with a creamy soup inside an egg shell, with brioche on the side (http://tinyurl.com/bkwjqbk).  It was good but not amazing.\n\n(Note: seems like other people got a 3rd amuse of a smoked salmon & cream cheese lollipop.  My husband really wanted this when he saw it.  I think maybe we didn't get it because I told them I don't eat raw fish.  If they really didn't give it to us because of that, they should have substituted something else or at least given it to my husband.)\n\n1st Course:  My husband had a dungeness crab salad (http://tinyurl.com/ajlo8oy), which he raved about.  I had a lobster bisque over broccoli romanesco, vanilla infused milk and bits of lobster (http://tinyurl.com/aay4rcb).  It was very good but not the best lobster bisque I've had.  Nice that it had real lobster in it though.\n\n2nd Course: My husband had the butter poached lobster that I had as my 3rd course.  I had burgandy snails with lemon butter and bone marrow gratin http://tinyurl.com/bgcq8v3).  It was decent.  I'm not a huge fan of escargot but it was fun to try.\n\n3rd Course: I had the butter poached lobster with musquee du provence ravioli and truffle beurre fondue (http://tinyurl.com/ahwl39f).  The lobster was perfectly cooked & buttery.  They gave me both a claw and a tail since it was my entree, and the ravioli was also amazing and in a creamy, truffle-y sauce that was to die for.  This was the only course that really blew me away.  My husband wasn't a huge fan of his roti of quail and squab (http://tinyurl.com/bgmh7ke) but I'm not sure he's had quail before so he might just not like it.\n\n4th Course (Dessert):  My bittersweet chocolate fondant (http://tinyurl.com/b6t7vnw) was a merely average molten lava cake and my husband wasn't wild about his apple tarte (http://tinyurl.com/al8veym).   Mignardises (http://tinyurl.com/a8cbmue) were really mediocre.\n\nWorth the price?  For the food, maybe.  It was a good meal although not nearly as memorable as the one we had at Acquerello recently at a similar price point.   But when you factor in the whole experience, including the service & ambiance, definitely not.", "author": "A M."}

This included 4 free amuse bouche plates: oyster, cauliflower mousse, Carmelized fig with honey, assorted candies/chocolate. Between us, we had Snake River ribeye, roast duck, goat cheese tartine, foie gras, scallops, lobster risotto, and a raddicio wrapped lobster. No one drank but myself, but I had a Parisian Mule cocktail and a glass of Pinot noir.  If the menu sounds great; you would be correct. I would say the prime rib and the amazingly fresh and rich tartine were standouts, but our party was loving everything.

Service was extremely attentive and, surprisingly, friendly!

The service is excellent, and the food is fantastic. Was lucky enough to fit in a meal here right before the foie gras ban took effect and good thing too! It would have been such a shame to miss out... though I hear through the foodie grapevine that if you're lucky you might get a special side on some nights still. :)\n\nThe dungeness crab salad is every bit as good as it looks (the caviar garnish really doesn't hurt), the tasting of roe was fresh and just a hint briny, lobster tail divine and the seared foie gras just amazing -- and rather overwhelming as it was the size of my fist.

But sometimes, It's great just to splurge a little, put on your black dress, and enjoy what the city has to offer.\n\nI came here with my special someone on Valentines day, hoping to have a great dining experience. Our waiter was very intentive and always came by to check up on us. He wasn't annoying either. He came at the appropriate times and told us about the set menu they had as their \"Valentine's Special\". \nHoly cow. In fine print, I read the small dollar sign with the numbers 300 after it. And that was per person. In retrospect, I'm not sure if our experience was worth $600 plus, but after seeing that number, it is sure that you won't ever forget!\n\nThat night, they served -if my memory serves me well- a five course meal. \nThey started with appetizers of various seafood sorts. It included abalone and caviar, and some sort of fish lollipop that actually looked pretty interesting. I want to say that the lollipop was the only familiar thing on that plate. It was also very umami and had a whole lot of body. Salty but soft in texture, it had a lot of dimensions, which made my experience very interesting.\n\nWe went on to lobster soup, which included a green puree sort on the bottom. I wouldnt care for that part because it was too rich in my opinion. I took one bite and had to stop because I thought I was going to have a heart attack. \n\nWhen the \"duck\" came out, I literally felt cardiac arrest coming. This was part of their secret menu..I never had so much fat on my duck as I did that day. I enjoyed it, and this had to be the best dish of the night. It was served with apple, which cut the richness of the duck well, and brought a little sweet and tartiness to the dense meat.\n\nThe next dish included duck cooked in various ways. Fried duck, slow-cooked duck (Yum!!), etc. The slow-cooked duck reminded me of pulled pork. The flavors were very smoky and I just wanted to put that in between two slices of baguette and eat it. The lady side of me stopped me.\n\nDessert: My favorite part of the night. Chocolate cake by master dessert chef?! oh yes. And to top it off with a small box of chocolates to take home that night?! Oh yes. Thank you!\n\nThis night was a great experience for me overall, but I would not come here again. This is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing that's great when you want to fancy it up and go somewhere nice.

We had two choices in mind and the sommelier was very helpful in our decision. The burgandy snails were overcooked and inconsistent. The sweetbread could have been cleaned better. I just expected more from a place with these prices. My lamb chop was delicious but I had to wait so long between course 3 and 4 that I had almost lost my appetite.

The flavors were all very good. Every dish was seasoned well with a lot of flavors bursting in your mouth. A couple of criticisms I have is that corn made an appearance in too many of the dishes (maybe it's this season) and I think portions were slightly off. The dessert was bigger than the main course - I feel like they could make the dessert a little smaller. Another thing is that I expected more sophistication in the flavor profile.

It's also not one of those super hushed places, where you feel uneasy about talking or busting out a laugh. We had some good laughs with the waitress and if you know me, good laughs are hard to keep in. Although fancyshamcy, very comfortable and relaxed (sometimes that's hard to find in a place like this).\n\nService: Great service!! Our waitress was patient, explained dishes to us, and even offered recommendations as well as accommodated to our every need. She asked for allergies (which most places don't) and she made sure we had the seats we wanted and made sure we were happy throughout the whole meal.\nThe chef came out and offered a friendly greeting to each table towards the end of the meal too!!\n\nFood: I would say it was an adventure. I tried some things I've never encountered and that's part of an eating experience. The portions were definitely more generous then other French restaurants that I've been to. They off a 3, 4, or 5 course meal and I would say even the 3 is way filling already because when I got 4, I was so stuffed. They allow wait time between courses too and I was still left feeling over the stomach expansion limit. \n\nThe chef offered two complimentary dishes as well, which were the seared ahi tuna and an egg..something? The egg was so good! I'm not good with names and I'm not really a fancy eater so sorry for my forgetfulness. You'll see it in the pictures :) They also offered a palate cleanser before the dessert as well as some delicious mini desserts as we got the check.\n\nFavorites: 1) Butter poached lobster 2) Lobster and mushroom risotto: risotto never fails! 3) Rack of Lamb: SOOO tender! 4) BUTTERFISH: O my..sooo flakey and melts in your mouth!! 5) The chocolate dessert (forgot name) was delicious too. Legit chocolate.\n\nNot so favorites: Trio of Rabbit: UHHH, salty and didn't have that good of a taste. It started tasting bland or just like chicken. The presentation was nice, but the lion was sort of unappetizing and the ribs were hilarious (see in picture) because of how small it was but didn't taste too good. Overall, the best part of that dish was the veggies, which is sad.\n\nIn the end, it was a fun dining experience and we got to enjoy things we loved and we got to be adventurous with some others (that didn't turn out so well).

I was curious if the portions would be enough, whether the atmosphere would be too snooty, and most importantly, if the food would live up to my taste expectations.  I have to say, I was absolutely blown away.\n\nFirst off, our waitress was amazing.  She was genuinely friendly, funny, and helpful when guiding us in our menu choices, and I have to say that our experience would not have been the same without her.  She brought out us two amuse bouches to start the meal (standard, but it makes you feel really special), and they both were excellent.  The first was some kind of mousse, with caviar (good), and the second was a soup with egg yolk and leeks (GREAT) contained within an eggshell.  Right off the bat with these tiny bites, you can see the chef's sense of playfulness and whimsy.\n\nAfter the amuse course, we chose to go with the caviar supplement. The perfection of this dish, an ounce of Oestra Caviar, served with potato blinis, lobster, and creme fraiche, was only heightened by the special feeling I got when eating it - this is not something you have very often.\n\nAfter these little plates to get us excited for our meal, highlights included: the tempura duck egg, the lobster risotto (FAVORITE!!!!!), the seared foie (obviously), the sweetbread/lobster/pig feet terrine, and of course the cheese souffle, because I will never say no to cheese + bacon.  \n\nWord to the wise: my dining partner and I both got four courses, and three probably would have been plenty.  We basically had to be rolled out of the restaurant.....however, I am a glutton, so if I were to go back I probably wouldn't even take my own advice.  \n\nThis was the BEST meal I have ever had, and not just because of the food: the non pretentious atmosphere, the friendly, knowledgable waitress, and yes, even the company, all made for a great evening.  I highly recommend La Folie for a special occasion to ANYONE...foodies and non foodies alike!", "author": "Mandy B."}

I think I love you. \n\nFor a super belated bday dinner I was taken here and my mind was blown away. I had 4 restaurants to choose from, but when I think fancy, I always thing French. Possibly from those 4 years in hs of french language study. French isn't only the language of love, but the language of delicious things. I had actually never heard of this place before, but my dinner date had scoped it out before, and done homework on Yelp.\n\nSidenote: While we were having dinner, we noticed a guy get stood up on his a date. Knowing that a reservation cancellation costs a ton, and this guy would be eating an expensive meal alone, we decided to ask him if he would join us. He declined, but we toasted him with a beverage and then continued on with our meal.\n\nThe one sad thing was our res was so late. It was like 9 before we were seated. Partially because I was running really late that day. Ended up getting 3 courses because it was so late.\n\n- We started with an amuse that looked like craw fish in a egg cup. It was so tasty.\n- Then to some kind of custard in an eggshell topped with caramel crust. Also really good.\n- I adore foie gras, and they gave a generous portion of this. It was super decadent and perfectly prepared.\n- For dins I had a fillet, cooked to perfection with a bone marrow yogurt chip of some sort. The meat and sides were awesome, but I guess I expected the marrow chip to be more than it was. Nevertheless it was good. \n\nFor dessert I had some peach puff thingy, super tasty, then they brought out the gold leaf topped chocolates. Gosh yum. Gold + Chocolate = amazing. \n\nGreat night.

However, the entire night was overshadowed by a comparison that kept looming in my mind: Gary Danko is better. \n\nThey're at the same price point, and have similar create your own prix fixe menu structures. I had five courses here and at Gary Danko, and they were uniformly better at the latter (with the exception of dessert). \n\nHighlights here are the snails in veal bone, arctic char (somehow has the tender texture of sashimi despite being cooked), sweetbreads, and the huckleberry baked alaska (a must get). Also, they give you a ton of freebies. I especially enjoyed the egg yolk-creme fraiche amuse bouche.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed by the entrees. My rabbit was bland, and my boyfriend's beef tasted like something you could get anywhere. On the plus side, they are not joking about the big portion sizes here. I sprang for the truffle supplement on my lobster risotto, and they shaved so much into the dish that it was nearly more truffle than risotto (which I didn't mind because the risotto was also bland).\n\nI did appreciate that Chef Roland Passot came out to thank diners near the end of service.

Perhaps with the obligatory and apologetic \" I really wanted to like this place ...\" \n\nAt prices this high I should not have to really want to like anything, I should just like it because it's worth it and good.\n\nFor a restaurant of this caliber one would expect a small chic space. Nuh-uh. \n\nThere's a loud bustling lounge (which seems to receive more attention than the actual dining area) attached to this restaurant and the dining areas are large (too large) but the tables poorly spaced. They basically wanted to shove as many people into this place as possible. \n\nWith so many tables  to keep track of, service was kind of lacking. Our forcibly amiable waiter was nice enough but sometimes standoffish. I slowly poked my way through a three course meal never so much as eating even half of what was on the plate (more to come on that) with neary a comment of concern from our self-involved server. At one point the waiter came by to ask about the meal, we were practically having dessert. I didn't answer. My date said it was okay but in a half-hearted manner. \"Great!\" the server chirped and flittered to his next table like a hummingbird to a flower. \n\nI don't expect to be fawned over or coddled but I would think a well trained waiter would know when a customer is unhappy with their meal and perhaps would give an ish, if not for good service then at least for a good tip. \n\n\nOur waiter never cleared the table or even brought the food out. He just made haphazard guest appearances. Hell, we should have been so privileged that he even asked us anything about our meal at all, I guess. I don't know who the eff this guy was. Maybe he wasn't even a La Folie waiter but some loony who escaped from a nearby psych ward and enjoys playing dress up occasionally for shiz and gigs. \n\nEven the waiters at TGIF would come over to comp or replace something if you seemed unhappy with your meal. \n\nNot here. \n\nNever a dish finished by me and $400 later all the \"waiter\" could say was, \"I hope you enjoyed your meal\" on my way out. I most certainly did not! \n\nPerhaps had he taken the time to provide us adequate attention he may have took notice. I was not happy with our waiter and on my way out he made it a point to say good-bye to me until I rightfully acknowledged him. \n\nAnyway, about the ghastly food. \n\nAs previously stated, maybe I really just don't like \"true French cuisine\", but the highlight of this experience for me was the bread served in the beginning and dessert at the end. The one star is for dessert.  \n\nThe Egg amuse bouche was gross. It had no seasoning other onion powder. Warm egg yolk overpowered by onion served in a brown egg shell. So avant-garde. I don't even know what to compare the taste to other than vility at its worst and maybe fresh spunk at its best. Shudder. \n\nThe Trio of rabbit (loin, rack, and braised leg). Mon Dieu. The portions were cute in a silly kind of way and please don't give me that tripe about how these are \"proper portion sizes\", blah, blah, blah. No they're not, let's stop lying. \n\nIt was of no matter anyhow because the flavor left a lot to be desired. It was salt, salt, and more salt. The only reason I even ordered it was because it was one of the only entrees that did not include an organ meat of some kind. \n\nI can't recall what the dessert was and that was actually the part of the meal I kind of liked. Odd. It was nothing game changing but it tasted good and this was a new sensation for my mouth given all the other foul things I had forced it to suffer through during this meal. \n\nMy date had the same amuse bouche but instead of my trifled troika of terror he ordered the duck which was a series of \"wonderfulness\" that included liver and tongue and Lord knows what else. I reluctantly tried some of it and it all tasted very bland and chalky.   \n\nPresentation was interesting but instead of trying to be haute couture how about we just make stuff taste good?

This year, it was La Folie.  It was a bit confusing finding the right door to enter, but once we got in, the experience started.\n\nThis place is great.  The hosts at the door were gracious and inviting.  It would've been nice if our server told us his name without me having to ask for it, but regardless, he was informative and attentive without hovering.  The rest of the service was fantastic - empty dishes were picked up right away, each course was explained thoroughly, water glasses were never filled more than 2/3 of the way full and were never let to fall below 1/4 of the way empty.\n\nAnd the food?  Well, see, that was the best part!  We each ordered the 4 course menu.  The teenager ordered the warm pig feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine, the lobster and mushroom risotto, \"Le Boeuf\" for her entree, and the kabocha creme caramel cake for dessert. The terrine was hearty and heavy and could definitely be shared by 2 people, and she raved about her risotto.  She said she'd love to just get a big plate of that dinner.  I had the dungeness crab salad and the halibut for starters; I chose the butter poached lobster for my entree and the peanut butter opera cake for dessert.  All were excellent, but the lobster was the definite stand out.  \n\nIn both our cases, the dessert course was probably the least outstanding, but I'm not entirely sure if that was just because we were beyond full by the time desserts were served.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-23", "description": "Had a full-on dinner for two ($450, with tip).  \n\nThere's a lot to like about La Folie.  My favorite parts:\n\n    - If you need a last minute reservation at a Michelin resturant, this is the first place I'd call.  We had our pick of times on a Thursday, and there were multiple empty tables there.  (Not a great sign, I admit, but the food was worth it.)\n\n    - My favorite part is their very cool menu selection algorithm.  They have the standard 3, 4, or 5 course prix pixe setup (with multiple dishes in category of appetizer, entre, seafood, dessert, etc).  The nice twist is that you can select multiple options from each category.  So, for example, you could pick *five* *entres* as your prix fixe selection, which at $100 is  a crazy steal.  I wound up with two entres and couldn't finish.    You can also substitute (at no charge) from the chef's specials.  It's a nice bit of flexibility.  \n\n    - The seating is very nice.  Plenty of space between tables (at least ours) so you can have a private conversation without second-hand verbiage from abutting tables jumbling into your meal.\n\n   - The hard alcohol pours are very (very (very)) honest.  The pernod I had was multiple shots and at $10 was cheaper than most dive bars. \n\n   - Similarly, the portions were generous.  A three course meal would have filled me up and the five course crushed me, which was a nice change after my experience at other SFbay Michelin resturants where I've had to eat another meal afterwards\n\n   - The staff and chef were gracious and well mannered.\n\n   - In the elegantly oblique phrasing of the waitress they \"still carry the dish for which we were formerly famous.\"  So if you want it, you can get it, despite the CA fucking food nazi regulations.  We ordered one serving ($40) as a big finger to the voters of CA.\n\nIn terms of food, it's a bit of a tougher call.  I liked the meal.  There were some standout dishes.  But it wasn't as spectacular as one would hope for.  However, I don't regret going and there's a good chance I'd go again.  Dishes we liked particularly:\n    - The huckleberry dessert was fantastic.  Just really good.\n    - The escargot was cooked in bone/bone marrow.  It's probably worth getting two of these.\n    - The la beouf had a nice selection --- the shortribs were particularly good, as was the mini burger.  It's a $20 added charge.\n    - The bread was warm and (it appears) cooked on premises.\n    - The asparagus soup was great.\n\nMy least favorite part was the $40 corkage fee.  \n\nIn terms of the SF Michelin restaurants I've eaten at this year:  I liked La Folie much better than Sons and Daughters.  I somewhat prefer it to Commis (which it clearly trounces in terms of value), but I think Commis has more dishes that contain stunning flavors.  Albeit on tiny portions.  But between the two, I'd pick La Folie if for no other reason than I get to pick the dishes and will be honestly full at the end after having private conversation.", "author": "D E."}

My first impression on walking in the door was that they were going with a grand contemporary Parisian ambience.  But the design details didn't look right to me.  They try too hard to make the place seem bigger than it is instead of embracing the intimacy of a smaller space.  Our hostess took us to the very traditional, 19th century dining room in the back.  Unfortunately my seat was right below the heat vent, so I was blasted with warm air all night.  This room too wanted to be much bigger than it actually was.  Then I noticed they were piping in 80s soft pop music...I have no idea what they were going for with that.  Jazz or nothing would have been fine.  \n\nThe wine list is surprisingly conventional.  The list of reds were weighted too heavily on bottles over $150.  I understand that really good red wines will start listing at around $80, but I think I saw maybe six bottles under $100.  Given the choices you need to make for your meal, six reds under $100 is hardly a choice.  And when I see lists with too many big name brands I start to think the chef wasn't very selective in designing it. \n\nThe menu is outdated and visually boring.  The font and layout needs sprucing up.    \n\nThe food.  Well, I can't complain here.  I had a four course dinner starting with the beet salad, which was truly excellent.  It was followed by a gratuitous slab of foie gras that was advertised to be pan seared but seemed like it barely hit the pan.  It laid on top of a stewed apple and drenched with a cider consumme.  The flavors were tremendous, but I wish the foie gras had been seared a little longer.  For my main course I ordered the lamb chops which also came out much less done than advertised.  When selecting your courses you must take this into consideration if you don't want to send your plates back to be done further.  It's clear that the chef has designed a delicious menu, but his tendency is to under cook.   And finally for dessert, the carrot cake.  It was good, but I wouldn't order it again.  \n\nThe service was prompt, courteous, and helpful.  \n\nOverall, I was a little disappointed by the experience.  I am not dissuaded from going back.

Extremely tasty and interesting.\n\nNext was the highlight for me, the pig's foot, lobster and sweetbread terrine over lentils.  Delicious.\n\nFollowing that was the butter poached lobster on top of a large sweet pea ravioli.  Great flavor combinations.\n\nFourth was the filet of beef with a bernaise croquette, bone marrow custard and a tiny baked potato all sitting on sauteed chaterelles.  Interesting spin on classic flavors.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate bread pudding with strawberry ice cream and green tea white chocolate.  the green tea was a really interesting addition that didnt overwhelm and added great flavor.\n\nWas handed a box of petit fours to go which looked delicious.\n\nTo summarize, opulence and elegance abounded here with large portion sizes and great flavor.  Not as cutting edge as Commonwealth and not quite as down right tasty as my meal at Flour & Water but amazing in it's own right.\n\nAn incredibly memorable meal.", "author": "Adam O."}

As you can tell from the 5 star review, I had a great time... but it wasn't all smooth sailing to get to that point.\n\nIt was akin to the experience one would have on a first date with that hot guy/girl.  The night started off in torment... (nothing fits right, you feel fat, hair is atrocious, a zit just popped up and you have 20 minutes left to get ready - I know you girls feel me on this one) .. but ended with that oh-so-sweet kiss that leaves you spinning, singing, dancing, and smiling stupidly to yourself for the week to follow.\n\nOur reservation was set a month in advance for 8:00 PM, Friday night.  I came up from San Diego for this special treat, accompanied by bf, bff and bff's 'cousin'.  \n\nWe arrived an hour early.. but found that Russian Hill on a Friday night means going around and around in hopes of finding a spot to park.  Oh SF, I did not miss your parking.  After circling around for 45 minutes, I decided to call and inquire about valet.  A heavily accented French woman confirms the availability of valet.. but then croons about how she was *just* about to call me (yeah right) because our table would be 20 minutes delayed.  \n\n--- 20 min. not a big deal.  So we valet and head over to their neighboring, but related, establishment (they aren't openly connected; they're separated by a wall) to hang out.  \n\nUgh, I'll have to check whether I can review their bar area alone.. but talk about pretentious and expensive.  There were no places to sit thanks to this annoying group that was spread over more chairs than they needed.  Beers were good but expensive.  \n\n8:30 PM.  Still no table.  Apparently a group was dilly-dallying.\n\nSo we head down to Tonic.. a bar at the end of the street (and I picked up a cup of rice pudding from Loving Cup - see review).  Another beer, killed some more time... \n\n9:00 PM.  Now it's getting ridiculous.  Lawyer, asian woman side is flared and irritated.. ready to ask for 15% of our bill cleared... we decide to crowd the door, but we weren't alone.. lots of other groups were waiting..  at least all the servers (minus the French lady) were super sweet.  They were nice and chatted with us.\n\nFinally--9:15PM.  We get a table.  We're just glad to be seated by this point.  \n\nThen the date to remember begins.\n\nOur server was fabulous.  He gave us the best service ever.  The chef made us extra dishes - particularly one with their house caviar (labeled to be $115 an ounce!!) with a heaping spoonful of caviar (absolutely to die for), cr\u00e8me fresh, and a potato pancake.  We eat ordered 3 dishes, all different - 12 different dishes in total - and they were all ... (wait for it).. AMAZING.\n\nWe even got a good sniff of the huge truffles that perfumed our table (the server put it near out table) as we enjoyed the best meal of my life.  Foie gras, butter poached lobster (my favorite), egg dishes, pork, etc.... This would have been the meal to die by.  \n\nWhat was even more amazing was that the chef came out himself to apologize for the wait and to thank us for coming.  Oh he is SUCH a sweet man.  We had to get desserts.  The Baked Alaska.. orgasmic.  The Bread Pudding.. I don't even like bread pudding but holy shit it was so good.  Even their bite sized palette cleansers were great.  There's this chocolate square of crunchy goodness that I want to lather myself in and eat.  \n\nIt was a fabulous meal... definitely the best I've ever had.. and probably the most expensive (ended up being ~$170 per head). \n\nHeed warning that the reviews are correct about timing of this meal.  We were at the restaurant well past 12:30 A.M.  YES.  You read right... past midnight.  But hell, it was worth it.  Every penny and bite.  \n\nWould definitely, absolutely, hands down recommend La Folie.\nStanding ovation and hats off to the chef.\nI'm saving my dime in hopes of returning here... GO CHECK IT OUT.", "author": "Kimmy C."}

Everything you expect from fine dining.\n\nI've been to La Folio twice now, and both times, the above has been the case.  Yet both times, I have staggered from the restaurant so screamingly, horrifying, bloatedly stuffed full that I feel sick as a dog.  It's now the following morning, and after a terrible night's sleep i still feel disgustingly full.\n\nAnd that's where Chef Roland Passot's magnificent home loses a star from me.  Yes, I could 'eat less', but in a five course meal over 3.5 hours, it is hard to know the quantities of food coming?  One of the things I am paying fine dining prices for is the skill of serving just the right quantity of food.  It may be that the Chef goes just a little large to satisfy the American audience; but really, unnecessary.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.  The tasting menu was utterly magnificent, the wine pairing perfect.  Just leave half the appetizer and half the main course on your plate, and you'll walk out the restaurant a happier man than I did.", "author": "Jon E."}

Yes, it was a hollow bone filled with snails inside. Delicious. And then the halibut was the perfect way to end my meal. Just the perfect size and was very soft and tasteful and the sugarsnap peas were a nice addition to it. \n\nBonus points goes out to the chef who brought out several, yes, SEVERAL, complimentary dishes! \n\nI hope that I get to go there for an anniversary someday because it is definitely the perfect choice.

I forgot about it honestly until I went here again and thought, damn I have been here.  The difference is that my palate obviously is way more sophisticated than it was when I was that young.  I do recall everything looking like art on a plate.

Yep, young and dumb.\n\nfast forward 15 years - now I can say the food at La Folie is edible art.\nThe menu changes and you can go \u00c0 la carte or do a 3, 4 or 5 course (80/90/100).\n\nLet's talk food: So lobster is my weakness.

I know that sounds hokey, but it is seriously like being on Top Chef without all of the commercials and annoying music. It's like a mini-vacation (and costs as much as one!); plan to spend three hours or more enjoying your meal.\n\nThe menu is pretty much prix fixe, and you choose whether you would like a three course, four course or five course meal. I got a three course meal and was completely full afterwards; the portions are of a pretty decent size for being so meticulously prepared. \n\nThe dining room is intimate, and you can tell that much thought was put into each food item-- from the amuse bouche to the entrees to the desert. The staff were warm and welcoming, and our server, Eva, was knowledgeable, friendly, nonintrusive yet present and helped us to fully enjoy our dining experience by explaining the flavors and how certain foods should be eaten (all at once, mix the flavors, keep separate, etc). \n\nLa Folie will provide a true dining experience; treat it like a vacation!", "author": "Kate B."}

After much deliberation and studying Yelp reviews, we finally narrowed it down to Acquarello and La Folie. The former is in a separate review. Of the two, La Folie is more my style.\n\nFirst, the decor was warm and inviting, quite modern, with a rich red accent color throughout. \n\nSecond, the service was spot on and never stifling. Our waiter, Caley was genuinely warm and accommodating. They didn't have a sommelier, which was fine since we brought our own wine. Corkage was hefty at $40 but we still saved money.\n\nThird, their Pre-Fixe menu was quite reasonable, at $85 pp. You could easily spend more, however overall their prices are better than other restaurants of this caliber.\n\nThat night, we had my favorite dish, Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Caramelized Fuji Apples and a creamy Foie Gras Soup. Perfectly done Seared Diver Scallop with Chanterelle Broth. Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin with decadent Bone Marrow Custard. We enjoyed a delicious cheese plate with a sheep's milk cheese called Moon Flower, served with Walnut Bread and Honeycomb.

Sure - it was nice that Roland Passot came out to thank my wife and I for coming, and  service at the restaurant was very good, but these high points aren't enough to overcome the food which was not stellar.  I won't bore you with what I ate - save to say that nothing was seasoned robustly and that was on purpose.  Given the prices being charged, I think it was a conscious choice to not alienate diners with exotic flavors.  I had been told that portions were large for a fine dining establishment only to find out that that statement was inaccurate.

Ever.\n\nChef Roland Passot did not disappoint on our highly anticipated visit to this quaint little restaurant in Lower Russian Hill. I've been hinting (not so subtly) to my fiance for at least one year about wanting to come here. So for this year's birthday, he treated me to a decadent meal at La Folie.\n\nWhen I think of La Folie, I think of Jeff W.'s review. \"Foie gras R us,\" was the term he used and rightfully so. Foie gras was everywhere on the menu from the usual seared form, torchon, and even a soup. We had the Seared Hudson Valley foie gras with squab, which was a HUGE portion. The torchon was the best we've had; it MELTED in our mouths, so velvety smooth. We did not have the soup. The last foie gras of the night came in the mini rossini burger in my beef trio entree. All were amazing. The \"Le Boeuf\" was my dream beef dish: a perfect slice of filet mignon, tender braised beef short ribs, and the rossini burger.\n\nOur other selections (soft poached duck egg, tasting of roe, duck breast, the two selection of fishes, which I forgot) were phenomenal so you can't go wrong.\n\nThey don't skimp on the portion. Between our 5 course meal, we had two amuse-bouches (house cured sturgeon with brioche and creme fraiche and poached egg in leek and garlic creme), a palate cleanser, and petite fours, so we were STUFFED at the end.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-03", "description": "1 star is strictly from my particular experience which my group seemed to agree with me as well.\n\nLa Folie was like that very first date I had when I was in my early teenage years.  My first crush was so beautiful to me and I haven't even gotten to go watch a movie or get ice cream with her yet.  I just couldn't wait to see her like I couldn't wait to get together with La Folie for the very first time.\n\nI've seen La Folie plenty online and whenever I'm in that area.  I was dying to try what they are all about here especially seeing that they were Michelin ranked before.  It was the night of my birthday and my cousin's gf booked this place for the 6 of us since she really wanted to give this place a go as well.  \n\nIt was a quaint little restaurant with atmosphere that's a little stuffy compared to Gary Denko.  Hostess was very kind and warm and the setting was luxurious.  I liked how it didn't feel like San Francisco in there and took us to another place.  It's very unfortunate that our experience there was nothing like we imagined.  It was memorable in a negative way so I'll get straight to it.  They are a 5 star restaurant and was Michelin ranked so I have to review it like so.  If it was a regular restaurant, that night may have gotten a 3 from me.\n\nTheir appetizers were fine.  I actually really loved their Dungeness Crab salad which was different and you can't really go wrong with soup.  Their wine isn't too bad either for the price.  We opened a few napa bottles there.  The biggest qualm I had with them is that all our food came out cold!!!  Furthermore, the meats and fish were so dry and overcooked!  My brother isn't much of a foodie or even care usually but even he made a comment about his petrale sole.  He asked me if the fish is supposed to be this dry because it feels like they way overcooked it.  After I tried it I told him to let them know so they can change it out but he just says it's your birthday and I don't want to make it a big deal.  In my mind it was a big deal but my brother never likes to be high maintenance.  He said it's cool I'll just eat it.  That was before I even tried my rabbit or my cousin's braised short ribs.  They were dry also and cold.  The short ribs were way too fibrous for something that was braised.  I'd expect that from another restaurant but not from a Michelin restaurant.  Such a huge miss!  I'm guessing it was just an off day but that is such a fundamental error.  The only reason why we didn't bring it up to the waiter is because my brother was getting irritated that we were complaining about the food.  He doesn't like eating at fancy restaurants so he felt as though we were just suppose to eat it the way it is served and leave.  The meal was also stretching into 3 hours at that point and I didn't want to ruin a nice birthday dinner with my loved ones so we sucked it up and made light of the situation for a fun outing together.  They weren't letting me pay and our time spent together is much more priceless than the food.  \n\nNonetheless, returning the food to the kitchen or not, the fact that majority of our food came out dry, fibrous, and cold is surely not a good sign from a supposed great restaurant.  The risotto was not bad and I think the cousin's gf had lobster which was alright as well.  The overall experience was trumped by the lack of finesse in the food.  The waiter was also not very knowledgeable about the wine so we ended picking bottles we knew.  He seemed a little stiff and not very charming either which was a huge contrast to the warm welcome we got from the front of the house.\n\nI know everyone seem to love this place but I haven't gotten the chance to fall in love with it.  Not sure if I'll even come back.  1500 dollars later for 6 people for a memorable night on the negative end of the spectrum really throws everything off about La Folie for us.  I'd stick with Gary Denko where they are always consistent with a much friendlier and hospitable vibe.  Such a vibrant staff at Gary Denko that it makes La Folie look like a drag.  This is just based off my night there and I just think they were really really really off mark for the night.\n\nGoes to show... Even if you were so infatuated and head over heels for a person or place you might just find there's nothing more to it than a dissipating daydream after that first date.\n\nHope everyone else gets a much better experience!", "author": "Colin M."}

It's amazing.\n\nLong Version:\nI ordered:\n* [Soup] Brentwood Farms Sweet Corn Soup, with crispy sweet breads and summer truffles\n- Really delicious, light and flavorful.  Was perfect with the small strips of sweet breads.\n\n* [Appetizer] Warm pig feet, Sweetbread, and Lobster Terrine, on a lentil salad with bacon and hazelnut vinaigrette\n- This appetizer was HUGE.  It could seriously pass for an entree.\n\n* [Fish & Shellfish] Seared diver scallops, on carrot & pea ragout with a pancetta and chanterelle broth\n- As expected, this dish was smaller, but everything was still very delicious\n\n* [Poultry & Meat] Roti of Quail and Squab, stuffed with mushrooms, wrapped in crispy potato strings, truffled jus\n- Super filling; it was like having 3 different dishes on 1 plate.  The quail stuffed with squab was really delicious, and the added bonus of the crispy potato strings wrapped around it was perfect.  Loved the added touch of a tiny fried quail egg on the side with more potato strings, made to look like a little basket.\n\n* [Dessert] Peanut Butter Opera Cake, chocolate peanut butter and caramel mousses, curry ice cream\n- HIGHLY recommend this.  SOOOO good!!!\n\nHubby ordered:\n* [Soup] Chilled Pea Soup, with sweet onion sorbet, bacon bites, lobster, brioche crouton\n- Couldn't imagine how good a pea soup could be, but this one was amazing.

The atmosphere and ambiance stepping into the restaurant was amazing and very romantic and not noisy at all. When walking into the restaurant you can feel that a lot of important people wine and dine here but our waiter made us feel right at home. Made reservations for my gf birthday and for the whole 3 hours it was awesome.Each of us ordered the 4 course tasting menu and we were so stuffed by the time the 3rd course came we could barely finish our food. *they let you play around with the menu so I opted out of dessert and got two appetizers for my tasting* We even got the pleasure to eat next to Mayor Willie Brown. What a great night and an excellent way to spend a special occasion. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of their excellent menu.", "author": "Norman D."}

Can be a cool Yelp feature :)\n\nWhat a foodie adventure, everything from the the moment you enter is designed to get you in the right state of mind for the perfect French dining experience.\n\nWhen you walk in, you feel like you enter a 1960's restaurant, not necessarily French looking, but definitely gives the mood of old school dining.\n\nMy girlfriend and I (her birthday) got a nice central table and for the first couple of minutes, I felt anxious.. Our waiter said hello, gave us the menus but disappeared. I first started feeling like we are in for a bad service experience which would be a shame, but I quickly realized that there is something that is missing from MANY restaurants these days. Peace!\nThe waiters give you time to sit, enjoy your conversation and don't rush you through the door. When you get in, it's a ~3 hours adventure, and they want you to take your time to enjoy it.\n\nNormally, just for such service, I would give a place 5 starts. But now the good part starts, the food, oh my, the food. (Did I say oh my? I'm drooling right now...)\n\nEverything on the menu looked amazing, and I LOVE the fact they let you pick and choose your 3/4/5 coure dinner from whatever portion of the menu you like. Feel like 5 deserts? why not? want to try all the meat dishes, sure... It's very rare and normally, all you can get is appetizer, main and desert.\n\nEvery dish apart for the frog legs was both delicious and well presented. A true foodie experience which ended with a nice warm greeting (and happy Bday wishes) from the artist himself.\n\nI applaude this place and will return to their lounge to enjoy a quick bite of my favorites.\n\n10/5", "author": "Assaf B."}

Service, presentation, and most importantly, the food were all impeccably executed.\n\nI'm not even going to bother reviewing the insane amount of plates that were brought to our table - because there were more than I could count on my fingers and toes combined... and also because you can read everyone else's reviews and still come to the same conclusion: FOIE GRAS.\n\nEach person in my party opted for the 4 course meal which turned out to be a lot of food. Chef Passot is amazingly attentive and proud of his masterpieces, so when he isn't happy, he gives you double the plates. Yes. You read right. As I was about to take my first bite from the first plate of Roti with Quail and Squab, my server - with her warm and amazing smile that didn't wane throughout our 3-hour dinner - informed me that the Chef felt my quail was overcooked and was already making another plate for me so I could taste the quail the way it was intended. \n\nSeriously?! Speechless. \n\nHe was a happy, smiling man as he came around our table to give me a high five for finishing the two plates and to take pictures with us. And I have to say, while I thought the overcooked quail was already delicious, the 2nd one was orgasmic - no gamey, rough taste; just tender juiciness!\n\nEach generously-portioned dish was presented so beautifully, my food porn stash inevitably grew. Among my favorites were:\n\n-Foie Gras Mousse (amuse bouche): smooth and creamy without being over the top.\n-Foie Gras Torchon atop a peanut butter cookie with strawberry sauce: AMAZING!\n-The duck breast and lobster tail were all cooked to delectable perfection as well.\n\nI'm in agreement with everyone else that La Folie serves the largest piece of seared foie gras I've ever seen. However, the seared flavor wasn't able to fully penetrate the thick piece that was presented, so it works to their disadvantage. Size isn't always everything! \n\nOverall, La Folie delivered the fine dining experience I think everyone should have at least once! It definitely lived up to my expectations!", "author": "Liana L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-09", "description": "So back in SF for a weekend and wanted to go out to dinner with someone to congratulate them on getting through a really tough week. The person was a big fan of French food and I had been dying to trying this place out after hearing people speak of La Folie in such a high manner with even some comparisons being drawn to Gary Danko (which I am still dying to go to). So we show up to Polk and valet the car and step right into the restaurant. It is not a large restaurant I would say but the light is dimmed to just the right level and the number of tables given in the room allowed for it to be not over the top noisy to the point where I could not hear my dinner conversation. The hostess greeted us and immediately brought us over to the table. A waitress then came over and provided menus including the vino list. \n\nI start to look through the vino list and narrowed it off to a few vinos. When the waitress came back and I asked her questions about the list, she actually said that she did not want to steer me in the wrong direction and that she would send over the sommelier. I was happy with the honesty and was able to order a solid vino that paired well with the food that was not a ridiculous price. The menu is interesting because essentially it is a \"Create your own meal\" approach. You can choose a three, four, five, or a set menu course list. You can choose any dish from the menu and turn it into the three, four, and five menu and they will adjust the portion based on if you see it to be an appetizer or an actual entr\u00e9e. Even beyond this, you can choose any of the dishes on the \"set menu\" list and apply it to these number set courses which I thought was a nice plus. Now I warn all of you yelpers that you will spend quite a bit of time figuring out which dishes you really want to choose because man this menu looks awesome. There were so many things I wanted to try and it was hard to narrow down.\n\nUltimately, we chose the Dungeness crab salad, Seared Day Boat scallop and saut\u00e9ed sweetbreads, the butter poached lobster, the Liberty farm duck breast and crispy duck confit gateau, and the lobster and mushroom risotto (with truffle on top!). The Dungeness crab salad came out and it was solid but nothing I felt blew my mind however the scallop dish was out of this world good. It was a solid dish and I appreciated the texture and flavors were just paired really and the presentation of the dish was very aesthetically pleasing. So yes yelpers all the hype you hear about this scallop dish is accurate. The butter poached lobster was solid as well and I enjoyed this dish and man was that ravioli out of this world good. Everything paired very well on this dish and I was sad that it was gone. The duck came out in three different ways and each one was awesome and transformed the flavor of the duck completely which I know sounds ridiculous but you just have to try it to understand. I was able to take a few bites of the risotto and this thing is really solid. I truly enjoyed it but I still do stand by my duck *gasp* I know. But I am just getting nitpicky. Honestly everything was awesome. We ordered a dessert but we unfortunately had to skip because of unforeseen circumstances but I know I will be back for it at some point! \n\nThis place was quite an experience and the service was just impeccable. Great service, wonderful d\u00e9cor, and awesome food. This was an awesome \"dining\" experience and not just a meal. What more can I ask for? I will definitely be back for more La Folie!", "author": "Dan M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-28", "description": "Wow, amazing, impeccable.  I don't just give out five stars but when I do you know it's got to be good.  My gf has been raving about La Folie since she and her friends went a few years ago.  She said it's better than Ritz Carlton even though the interior is not as nice but the quality of the food was better.  Tonight I took my parents here for their anniversary dinner and it was simply perfect.  I had booked and canceled many places such as Dining Room, Masa's, and I was worried La Folie wouldn't live up to my expectations but it more than did.\n\nThe menu which allows you to choose three, four, or five course tasting menu is probably the best.  It gives you the selections you want and you can order as much or as little as you want.  Here are the dishes we had.\n\nSnails in Bone Marrow: I didn't eat this course but my mom said it was delicious.  The presentation of the plate was also extremely beautiful.  A big piece of bone marrow in a sea green of foam.  \n\nDungeness Crab Salad: My dad didn't give much feedback but having seen him gobble it up quickly, I would say it was very good.\n\nSeared Foie Gras: Extremely generous portion, in fact probably the biggest piece of seared foie gras I've seen in a while.  Blended with the peach (if I remember correctly) it was a well balanced complement.  \n\nFoie Gras Torchon : This is one of my favorite dishes.  Again, very well made cheese brioche, a piece of squab, fig paste (?), plus a power bar which was comprised of fig, peanut butter, and something else.  I know it doesn't sound great but you know somehow it all mixed.\n\nLobster Risotto: Perfectly portioned with morel mushrooms and pieces of lobster.  \n\nAbalone with Ikura three ways: I'm not sure if this is even correct but the dish had ikura served with three different elements.  One was with oyster, one was with abalone, and one tasted like thai curry.  My mom said the different in taste really brought out the great flavors of the thai curry.\n\nSquab and Quail: Very well made pieces of squab or quail wrapped with mushroom.  \n\nDuck Breast: Duck confit, pieces of seared duck.  \n\nHalibut with diced ratatouille: From the look of it, the fish was perfectly cooked with a great compliment of diced ratatouille.\n\nFrog Legs: Since this was a main course, there were a generous amount of frog legs.  I didn't have any but from I heard it was also very good.\n\nWe were so full that we only had a few bites of the last few dishes hence the lack of info.\n\nDesserts:\n\nPetit Fours: The petit fours included madeleines, canelee, a chocolate two way (not too sure what the two ways were), and a gelee.  I've never been a fan of petit fours but these were the best ones I've had.\n\nBaked Alaska with Peach Tartare: Peaches were sweet and juicy which complemented the Baked Alaska's cream very well.  What I really enjoyed in the Basked Alaska was the peach gelato over the earl grey pound cake.  Earl grey pound cake!  I'm a fan of jasmine, green tea, earl grey flavors which are transformed into various foods such as ice cream, cake, and cookies.\n\nCheese Souffle: Had a bite, not a fan of cheese souffle but when I looked up, my gf had ate it all so no need to say, it was delicious.\n\nThe service was very good.  They didn't put the dishes down at the same time but sometimes that doesn't need to happen.  They did serve the ladies first which is important.  They were kind enough to create a mocktail for us which was very good.  I usually drink hot water when eating at restaurants and let's say my cup of hot water never went below half full before they came over and filled it up again.\n\nI get to eat my fair share of good restaurants and La Folie just made the top of my list.  It may not be my favorite because I'm not sure what my favorite is but I was extremely impressed.  You could tell they spent a lot of time in the presentations of the food, the portions were generous, the wait staff attentive, and the interior while not the most lavish, it was simple yet elegant.  The restaurant was so great that a baby probably no more than a few months old didn't even make any noises and slept through the whole meal.\n\nLa Folie is what fine dining is about.  You get dressed up for a wonderful meal expecting everything to be great and it turns out to be great and even more.  There are so many more places I want to try in the Bay Area but I wouldn't mind skipping a new place and coming back because this is definitely a special place.", "author": "Pierre L."}

Although my BF told him I have a lobster allergy, one of the dishes came out with lobster, and the waiter quickly took it back.  To make up for his mistake, he constantly filled my glass of champagne, and only charged us for one glass, even though I probably drank close 5 glasses.  For our main course, he chose a nice glass of red wine for me, and again didn't not charge us.

Not the pretentious slice of over zealous brie which overwhelms the palate but instead a place where flavors and textures are combined in an art rarely seen in many restaurants these days.\n\nIf food was a language then what La Folie produces would not just be the language of love it would be the poetry. Each bite combines delicate well considered textures with magical and sensitive flavours.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\nTo begin with I indulged in the Dungeness Crab Salad, on Pea Panna Cotta, Yellow Curry Tuile, Curried Spiced Crab Vinaigrette - so light it felt like crab was dancing across my palate.\n\nFollowed by the Butter Poached Lobster, on Pea Ravioli with Truffle Beurre Fondue, and Marcona Almond Salad. Could the Lobster have been more succulent? I doubt it.\n\nRoasted Emigh Farms Lamb Rack, with Summer Squash, Lamb Tongue, Eggplant Pur\u00e9e, Nicoise Olive Lamb Jus. Who could have known that such delicate flavours combined with lamb and tongue would lead to this heavenly combination?\n\nThe staff were informative, attentive and charming.

On both visits, two years apart, the restaurant has managed to exceed my expectations and impress me with their food.\n\nThe service is what you'd expect going into this kind of restaurant. On the more formal side, but I do think they should have given us a bit more attention. More often than not, it was us flagging down our server to ask for something, and even this was made difficult because she didn't come around much (which is saying something, as there are only about 10 tables inside the whole place).\n\nFood is really delicious. I'd say that their duck is probably the best I've ever had, and their lobster is one of the best items on their menu. If you're indecisive, you can be guaranteed a delicious journey if you pick either of those. They do great with their amuse bouches, and there are plenty to set the tone of the next course. Their courses are a little bigger in portion than I'm used to at Michelin restaurants, so you're better off doing a smaller tasting menu (we did the 4 course one and we couldn't finish - literally stuffed to the brim by the end of the meal). It's harder to appreciate more nuanced flavors when you start getting too full, so I think they could do with sizing down their portions and focus on really bringing out some more subtle and unique combinations of flavors. I was also surprised to see that much of the menu was the same as when I had came here two years ago, from the appetizers to the main courses, even though I came in fall then, and spring now.\n\nAll in all, a great, consistent Michelin that doesn't kill your wallet and will deliver a solid fine dining experience.", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

Being long time residents of Russian Hill, we and our friends have dined at La Folie on previous occasions. Sadly, what was once a Russian Hill gem has become an upselling machine. After we repeatedly declined our server's endless attempts to upsell everything that was not nailed down, she became noticeably sullen. Our entire dining experience was unpleasant due to La Folie's policy of blatantly pressuring their guests not only when taking the initial order, but through out the ENTIRE meal. I truly have never experienced anything like it, It was relentless. \n\nWe have dined at the finest restaurants across the globe. I will never spend another uncomfortable evening at La Folie. This is a restaurant whose business model appears to be to treat their guests with disrespect and upsell at any cost. That was my experience. We will leave La Folie to the TOURISTS  who flock there unaware of what awaits them - upselling at it's worst. \n\nI will spare you the details of the dated decor, and wine pairings with small pours of mediocre wine served with attitude. \n\nWe are not the only Russian Hill residents of a certain address who have crossed La Folie off our list forever.", "author": "S W."}

The fois gras tasted like a marrow steak belly.  It was juicy and hot and savory and melted in our mouths.  Wow.  I can't believe we get to devour such things and have experiences of pure happiness through our palates.  Lucky humans!\n\nThen at some point of our meal, we were served a creamy egg amuse bouche served in a small half-egg shell.  I think we might have been eating quail egg, but not 100%.  I posted a couple of dark pictures of our meal.\n\nI also remember the service being oh so sweet.  Our server was so not pretentious, helpful, and very attentive.

My wife and I were torn between the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing and picking our own five course meal from the menu.  We decided with picking our own.  Started with the Golden Osetra Caviar, which was one of the best things I've tasted in a long time.  I highly recommend it. We then got the Triple T Ranch Tempura duck egg (excellent), scallops (excellent), burgundy snails (OK), Foie Gras (Very good, but way to large for the amount of rich flavor it had.  This was the size of a steak, and made me overwhelmingly full for the rest of the meal), lobster and mushroom risotto (excellent), lamb rack with side of duck tongue (excellent), and ribeye (excellent).  We topped it off with the cheese souffl\u00e9, which was excellent too.\n\nGreat atmosphere and the service was top notch.  Would I go back?  Absolutely!", "author": "Simon B."}

Both were truly excellent, though the foie gras is clearly a speciality here, so I highyl recommend it.  For dinner I had the Sea Bas which was good, but nothing spectacular.  For dessert my girlfriend had the baked alaska, which was so-so.  The ice cream was warm inside and she feels she has gotten much better at other places.  I had the chocolate dessert which was excellent.  We had the wine pairing with the 3-course dinner.  The wine was truly disappointing in many cases and I have had much better wine pairings in this range.  In addition, when ordering an extra glass of wine I received the wrong glass.  \nMy problem with this restaurant is that in many ways the ambience and service are not en par with the food (and price).   The dining room felt crowded, which I don't like when you shell out almost $500 for dinner for two.  THe tables were so close we could almost share our meal with our neighbors.  \nBut the weakest part of the place is the service.  It seems like on waitress ran around taking orders from everyone, with the rest of the wait staff delivering the food and clearing plates.  Those folks mainly stood around doing nothing, while the waitress was never to be seen when we needed here.  THe place simply does not have the service level of other restaurants in this price range.\nIf you go, definitely have the foie gras, unless you have moral objections.  It will be one of the best ones you have had.  But now that I have had I am not planning to go back.", "author": "Gerd C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-29", "description": "This is more than a Michelin star and a neighborhood gem.  La Folie is as much a destination for French cuisine as Napa is for wine.   \"The Madness\" is on top of Russian Hill and over the top--in a very good way.  You begin with not one but two amuse-bouches.  You can request shaved black truffles on any course for an additional $10.  Chef Roland Passot greets you like you're an old friend from his native Lyon.  Your server talks like the Wikipedia of French food (did you know foie gras production in the US only uses ducks?).  Everything about this restaurant is so ridiculously special that you forget you're just a new attorney trying to make it in a big city--and that you didn't have your first raw oyster until you were 20.  I digress.\n\nBeing a very lucky girl, I've dined here not once but twice--the first time as a treat for my 25th birthday and the second time as a treat to myself for making it through the California Bar Exam without dying... or crying.  Although the menu changes seasonally, it never fails to instill excitement in me like a contestant on The Price Is Right.  Some find the Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland fun; I find the Burgundy Snails in bone marrow gratin at La Folie thrilling.  My must-haves here, however, are the foie gras and lobster.\n\nThe seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras was the LARGEST and most LUSCIOUS piece of duck liver I've ever had in my life.  About the size of my fist (~8 oz.), it was accompanied by caramelized cherries jus and aged maple syrup.  I could discuss how beautiful, buttery, savory, sweet, and absurdly wonderful it was for days but, like falling madly in love, it's a very personal experience--one not to be lived vicariously by one foodie through another.  Trust me when I say the foie gras is worth the $10 supplement and harassment by animal welfare groups.\n\nOn my latter visit, I complained that the foie gras was half the size that I remembered (note that my fist had not grown).  Our server apologized, explained that Chef Passot was out of town and the sous chef was stingy with his cuts, and presented us with foie gras cappuccino and a different preparation of seared foie gras--FREE.  Now that's service.\n\nThe butter poached Lobster was also pure perfection.  I've always preferred lobster Chinese-style--that is, smothered in garlic, butter, and crack--and I've never really cared for boiled lobster with drawn butter because it's bland and boring.  La Folie takes lobster with butter to another universe, though.  Imagine fresh, rich lobster.  Couched on a giant sweet pea ravioli.  Immersed in a luxurious truffle beurre fondue.  I must have been in HEAVEN eating this because it tasted like a DREAM.\n\nI've never had dessert here except for the complementary Valrhona chocolate bread pudding and strawberries on my birthday, which was decadent and delicious.  Neither my stomach nor my wallet are fat enough for more than three courses, and in a battle of decisions between a second appetizer or dessert, the former wins every time.  Maybe one day the Baked Alaska will be mine, just like maybe one day I'll be mayor of this town.  Until then, I'll just have three courses--all seafood or meat.\n\nThis is the best French restaurant in San Francisco.  Bar none.  I'm dying to return but I'll be ok if it's not for a while (when I actually have discretionary income) because, when you've had a meal this good, the memories last.", "author": "Liz T."}

We had family visiting from out of the country and found the perfect excuse to make a mid-week trip here for dinner.  We had a large group, 10 people, but reservations were easy to make and since it was mid-week, there was plenty of room.  A majority in our group, including me, decided to be brave and go with 5 courses - no dessert.  That added up to a whole lot of good food!  Here were the highlights:\n\n- Our server, Eva, was great!  She answered any questions we had and introduced each dish as it came.  \n- Tasting of Passot Roe - this dish is indeed covered with roe.  I found the roe to be a bit overwhelming, but the middle salad....it was so good!  The side dishes were okay.\n- Off the menu - Your server might suggest something that is off the menu...I would get it!  Very generous and delicious dish!\n- Sear scallop and sweetbreads - wonderful dish!\n- For meats try the quail, duck or lamb dish.  All three are great.\n- To skip - asparagus soup, snails in bone marrow, lobster risotto (very heavy dish)\n- The food is very pretty.  Presentation is much better than Dankos.  The portions are also huge!  So plan your dishes accordingly!\n\nI must say that I felt the food was under salted that night.  Generally salt is not placed on the table at places like this, but we had asked for salt for our bread so we had salt on the table.  My husband had gone previously and asked for salt during the meal, and that brought the chef out of the kitchen!  \n\nOverall, great service, food and a grand time with family.

It is without a doubt better than Michael Mina and at the same level as Gary Danko (La Folie is way easier to get a reservation). If you're looking for a way to spend your annual bonus or wanting to celebrate a special occasion, you should go to La Folie. The restaurant serves classic French food and you can choose a tasting menu or pick and choose your own 3, 4 or 5-course meal. Chef Roland Passot is a genius in the kitchen. The meal started with two lovely amuse bouches, salmon lollipops and a delicately poached egg yolk in a potato leek soup (served inside an eggshell). We tried a variety of dishes but my favorites are the seared foie gras, poached lobster on a ravioli, sauteed snails and the rack of lamb.\n\nIf you enjoy foie gras, I suggest you go to La Folie before July 2012 (then, it becomes illegal in California). Chef Passot cooks the foie gras perfectly and serves it with a poached apple with an apple consomm\u00e9. It has the perfect \"melt-in-your-mouth\" consistency and I love the savory/sweet combination pairing with the apple. Definitely better than Michael Mina's foie gras at NobHill Tavern in Las Vegas.\n\nThe poached lobster on top of a ravioli is exceptional. It is the best thing I ever ate. This beautiful piece of lobster tail is butter poached and served on top of a ravioli filled with pumpkin with truffle butter. Everything is cooked perfectly (I even watched the chefs cook each ravioli in it own special pot). I honestly can't even use to words to describe this dish because it is so amazing. You must order this if you go.\n\nIf you like escargot, I really recommend the sauteed snails. The chef hollows out a bone and fills it with snails, bone marrow and delicious lemon butter. It's a unique and beautiful presentation and a clever twist on the normal French-style escargot dish.\n\nI was really impressed with the rack of lamb and how thick the two lamb chop pieces were. I appreciate that La Folie does not serve bite-sized food (I am not a bite-sized person). Lately, I feel like all these \"higher-end\" restaurants serve really tiny portions and then I'm left hungry after shelling out $50+ for food. You will not leave La Folie hungry.\n\nMy family ordered almost every single dessert on the menu and they have some interesting dishes like the cheese souffl\u00e9 and the peanut butter opera cake. Truthfully, I'm not a fan of a savory souffl\u00e9. I've tried them a couple of times and I definitely prefer the normal, sweet ones. Out of all the desserts, my favorite was the apple tart tatin. The presentation was gorgeous again and it's not a normal tart. The pastry chef made it in to a beautiful, layered \"cake\" almost with Maker's Mark ice cream and a pumpkin creme caramel.\n\nLa Folie is the perfect package- amazing food, warm decor and exceptional service. Anthony Bourdain just ate here in his recent episode on The Layover. So the next time you have money burning a hole in your pocket, go to La Folie.

Many have remarked upon the huge portions - and it's true, I couldn't finish mine - but that hardly detracts from the quality of the food or the service.\n\nI booked La Folie for my graduation night for our party of seven, and any doubts I vanished once the starter arrived. The Tasting of Passot Roe was actually one of the better first courses in our meal, fresh, delicate, with a crispness of flavor that I really liked (not too salty). Most everyone opted for three courses but I went for four, as I couldn't resist having a little more (I'm a small person and would have risked becoming too stuffed to walk if I'd ordered more!)\n\nOf the courses I tasted from our party:\n\nTasting of Passot Roe - I would recommend this first as it was the best starter in my opinion.\nAsparagus Soup - Flavor was so fresh that it was almost startling.

The fish was melt-in-your-mouth sublime. Squash was just delicately fried, crispy, the sauce spilling into my mouth when I bit into it. \nTrio of Rabbit - Rabbit is hit or miss for me, but this was quite good - very flavorful, not gamy.

Weird complaint, I know, but I'd rather be able to enjoy my food instead of worrying how the heck I'm gonna fit everything into my belly!\n\n[Tip: if you want foie gras but don't want to pay the $10 supplement, order the foie gras soup instead. It comes with a pretty decent serving of foie!] (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ)\n\nThe meal started off swimmingly with 2 amuse bouches (house-smoked sturgeon [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=yAq3AJVchB6ijw8wgIY_qg] and coddled egg [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=-wA2xCpNlbn8NYZT21TZkA]), foie gras torchon, and crab salad. The FOIE GRAS TORCHON (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=DRq8Sd1wBdnD_apkCtllvg) was one of my favourite dishes.

The CRAB SALAD (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=aJYrVl5qTZ1_7meskc4SbQ) was super refreshing. It came with a cauliflower panna cotta that looked like silken tofu, but had a grainier texture and tasted like cauliflower. Very innovative!\n\nThe next course was the beginning of the end. The GREEN GARLIC SOUP (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=KD5uLfFQvUZ46ABrkT7R_w) and SAUTEED BURGUNDY SNAILS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=M0EhyW7CqwWfX3LhtTanow) were both delicious but way too rich. I didn't really enjoy any of the following dishes (except for dessert), probably due to a combination of my not liking the flavours and my feeling queasy.\n\nThe most disappointing dishes were the GOAT CHEESE TATIN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=NL3OVwkQ0nNxbk3fn7E25g) and the WARM PIG FEET, SWEETBREAD & LOBSTER TERRINE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=SLkoyhVcG0fZLRiTkUh5_w). They were presented beautifully but the flavours didn't appeal to me. They were also huge and very heavy.\n\nWe got 3 seafood dishes and skipped the meats this time. The LOBSTER (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=mLfVXKm4VBDZqgovePrZXw), ARCTIC CHAR (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=b6oLvcT26FLkaj_B0yaMlQ), and ATLANTIC STRIPED BASS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=o1ZlC53IHIA2l1IYP-mP5A) themselves were all cooked really well, but I didn't like the dishes as a whole. While the English pea ravioli in the lobster dish was tasty, the truffle beurre sauce was really rich (albeit yummy). I didn't think the watercress coulis worked with the arctic char and nor the iacopi butter bean puree and chickpeas with the striped bass.\n\nAt least the meal ended on a high note. My other favourite dish was the valrhona CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=8vTIPpiYErYOTArHf0ff1A). A-MA-ZING!

The atmosphere was awesome -- a nice, fancy restaurant that's reminiscent of the French decor you'd find in New Orleans. \n\nOur server, Iva, was knowledgeable and friendly. The service as a whole was pretty great, but that's expected for a restaurant at this price point.\n\n------------------------------\n\nFOOD:\n\nAmuse Bouche 1 (Foie Gras Mousse) = A great way to start off the meal. Light foie gras flavor that really prepares you for the foie gras feat that awaits you.\n\nAmuse Bouche 2 (Egg yolk w/ carrot soup and brioche) = This was interesting and actually quite good. The carrot soup is excellent with the running egg yolk.\n\nTempura Duck Egg on Sweetbread Pancake = I loved this dish. Duck egg was prefectly runny and it was delicately fried.\n\nSeared Foie Gras = Holy crap, this is the biggest single serving of foie gras I've ever seen. It was literally the size of my fist. It was well-cooked with tons of that fatty foie gras flavor. I don't think it really went very well with the sliced pear/apple beneath it -- I wish they had a better complementary ingredient to balance out the fattiness. It's definitely not the best foie gras I've ever had, but it is pretty remarkable to look at.\n\nFoie Gras Torchon = The torchon was good, but didn't have a very strong foie gras flavor that I was expecting. I was probably foie gras'd out from the seared foie gras, but it just wasn't as satisfying as I was hoping. \n\nLobster Risotto = The lobster was perfectly cooked, but the risotto was way too creamy. It felt more like a thick soup than a risotto. Don't get me wrong, though, the buttery flavor was amazing, but I actually prefer the lobster risotto at Gary Danko.\n\nFoie Gras Mousse dessert = This was great. Loved the hazelnut wafer, as it perfectly meshed with the foie gras mousse. The bacon ice cream was a strange pairing, but definitely delicious on its own.\n\n------------------------------\n\nWhat disappointed me, however, was the fact that they didn't do anything for my friend's birthday. I had called them in advance to make sure they knew it was his birthday, and I even reminded the waitress at dinner. But they didn't even give us a verbal \"Happy Birthday\", let alone something special that I was expecting. We were in a rush, yes, but they could have at least done something when they brought out the desserts. \n\nI may sometime in the future give La Folie another shot, but compared with all the amazing French restaurants in San Francisco, my experience just wasn't a phenomenal one.

The rabbit trio presentation was stunning and beautifully prepared. The wine list is well thought out and very nicely organized. Desserts were a strong finish. \n\nThe experience lacked nothing.

I was literally seconds away from walking out because they seated us 45 minutes late!  The hostess wasn't rude but I felt her to be a little curt.  They didn't even offer us a glass of wine or anything as we were waiting but I decided to let it slide and was determined to have a great meal.  However, they more than redeemed themselves.  As we were seated, the hostess apologized again for the wait and said \"the kitchen will take care of you\".  That's a pretty vague statement and I just figured we would get an extra appetizer or amuse or something.  Salmon lollipops arrived at our table and I figured that was a little gift for the wait.  I was perfectly content with that as the salmon was really good and a wonderful little bite.  We order our meal and after we receive the first amuse bouche, not one but two plates of caviar on potato pancakes with lobster arrived.  Holy moly it was beyond our expectation that the chef would gift us these plates to apologize for the wait.  They really could have given me a glass of wine and I'd be happy.  This was really uncalled for and very, very much appreciated.  These plates are usually $60 each and it was just a great way to reverse our moods.\n\nTheir menu is prix fixe with options of 3 course for $80, 4 for $90, 5 for $100, and the chef's 5 course for $110.  You can choose any options, meaning you can have two desserts if you'd like or two appetizers.  The server said they recommend only ordering one dish from the seafood and meat section as the dish is pretty substantial.  I'm not sure if this is their way of telling you that you are not allowed to order two large entrees or if it really is too large of a portion.  You can choose any item from the chefs menu or the regular menu with some options having an additional charge.\n\nWhat I liked about this restaurant aside from the how delicious the food was is that the portions are substantial.  Almost every table I saw took home a doggy bag.  That is practically unheard of in fine dining.  Usually the plates are small and concise with not much left except for your desire to lick the plate clean.  They also give you two amuse bouches, a palate cleanser, and petit fours for dessert.  The service was fine dining at its best with attentive servers and serving on the left and clearing from the right.  It's the little things that make me happy.\n\nWe had aside form the caviar:\n**Saut\u00e9ed Burgundy Snails, in Pernod Lemon Butter, Parsley, Bone Marrow Gratin\n**Foie Gras soup with seared Foie Gras (special)\n**Warm Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine, on a Lentil Salad with Bacon and Hazelnut Vinaigrette\n**Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Spice Poached Apple and Apple Consomm\u00e9 (additional $10)\n**Liberty Farm Duck Breast, Smoked Duck Tongue, Cranberry Orange Sauce\n**\"The Sunset\" Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant, with Chocolate Ganache, Cr\u00e8me Anglaise, Brandied Dried Fruits\n\nAs you can see it was quite the rich meal.  The seared Foie Gras was easily 5 oz (of heaven).  Everything was cooked to perfection and I got to try both duck tongue and lamb tongue which I enjoyed tremendously.  The snails were so soft and succulent, not tough and chewy whatsoever.  We were absolutely stuffed after the two foie gras dishes and the snails but managed to power through everything else.  We took the duck and lamb home and even the next day warmed up in the microwave everything was still delicious.\n\nWe had such a wonderful time and would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a great meal or celebrate something special.", "author": "Mylinh M."}

La Folie has a great wine list. If you want to order cocktails, they walk next door to get a menu and drink for you.\n\nThe 3 of us (all girls) ordered a salmon lollipop, lamb loin, trio of rabbit and butter poached lobster. Salmon lollipop was a little salty. Lamb loin was amazing, didn't have that lamb taste to it. Rabbit tasted funny, maybe I'm not a big fan of rabbits. Poached lobster was literally the size of my fist, took 3 bites to finish. The waiter forgot about our appetizer (salmon lollipop) and we had to ask him after we finish our main course. He went to check on it and brought back two salmon lollipops which was on the house. We ordered a peach dessert and it was really good but forgot the name of it. Their menu changes daily and you can choose to order a 3-5 course dinner or each dishes separately.  We were there for our birthdays, so they gave us petit pastries with a candle on it served on a tray. It was really cute! \n\nOur total bill came out to be $160 including tips.

Unfortunately, our experience was less than good and I don't think we'll be returning.\n\nIt started out with the wait time. We came about 20 minutes early so we checked in and grabbed a drink next door. They were running behind about 30 minutes so we were waiting for almost an hour. Not a good start. Then, they sat us in the back room rather than the front. It's a small room used for private parties that is in desperate need of a remodel. It reminded me of the haunted house at Disneyland....very old looking and not so romantic.\n\nService was great so there's no complaints there. Our sommelier and server were both friendly and knowledgeable. I think we ordered 5 courses each plus champagne to start off the night and 2 bottles of wine (1 white and 1 red). \n\nThe food was okay, but there wasn't a stand-out dish the whole meal. Here's a few dishes I did remember...The tempura duck egg was interesting but it's too heavy for a starter. The seared foie gras is crazy huge and possibly the largest I've ever seen, but after that you won't have much room for anything else. Risotto is bland and uninteresting so I only had a few bites.\n\nTiming was horrible! We waited soooo long in between each dish. I've never experienced such long wait times.

Although the presentation was not as impressive, the risotto was so good. It's a bowl of buttery lobster goodness! The lamb rack is tender like filet mignon, it just melts in your mouth in a meaty way.

This is one decadent place, what ever you order will have something extra for it, a truffle, a glass of Sauterne, they should have given me a bucket. \n\nI have very mixed emotions here, I felt like I was in three different restaurants at the same time. One was a fine dining establishment hell bent on the finest service. The other, a stage production of How Many Things Can We Up-sell You by David Mamet, and the third, a cafe run by a tyrannical Frenchman clanking a bell for orders to be picked up by a staff that is so overwhelmed by up-selling and dangling enormous truffles under the nose of every diner.\n\nThey recommended a jacket so I wore a zip up sweater over my button up. \n\nMaybe I am just too old for gimmicks, but a 50 year old lady pursing her lips while holding a $600 truffle over my head explaining I can get some of this shaved over anything for $25 is annoying. Maybe for some of the younger crowd or those who have never seen a truffle this is exciting stuff, but for me it is the fine dining equivalent of an infomercial.\n\nI don't remember every course, some were amazing, like the Fois Gras, it was 5 fucking oz! this is enough to engorge the livers of a family of five. (See what I did there?) Had I known I would have ordered completely different. Then there was the fish course, my girl had a big chunk of Sea Bass ( I think) and I had one diver scallop, not an unfair amount, but what an odd looking disparity.\n\nThe rack of lamb was a stupid preparation, one frenched bone with a perfectly cooked, albeit lower quality piece of lamb than I am used too. This was matched with a piece of lamb loin wrapped in Merguez sausage. The sausage destroyed any flavor of lamb, this dish was a lot of work to remove the greatness of the ingredients.\n\nWe both ordered four courses, expecting appropriate sized plates, what we got was so bloated, we took turns puking to make room for dessert. That's what the Romans used to do right?

I'd have preferred the front room seats but that was how things turned out.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive, making sure to check on us for every dish and our water glasses were always refilled promptly.\n\nNow for the food:\n\n2 amuse bouche dishes before our actual meal:\n1) Foie gras\n2) egg yolk in eggshell\n\nCan't comment on the two amuse bouche since I gave them both to fiancee. The dish presentations were artistically displayed though.\n\nMy 3 course items:\n1) Dungess Crab Salad with cauliflower panna cotta, yellow curry tuile, curried spiced crab vinaigrette\n-Very refreshing filled with chunks of crab. The yellow curry sauce added just the right extra flavoring to the dish.\n2) Butter Poached Lobster with ravioli with truffle fondure and almond salad\n-This is a great dish, but perhaps a bit overhyped by Yelp reviewers. Ravioli was just average and I personally prefer crab over lobster. If the ravioli was stuffed with lobster, that would be a different story.\n3) \"The Sunset\" Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant with chocolate ganache and brandied dried fruits\n-I eat a lot more dark chocolate these days and this was simply rich and perfect.\n\nFiancee's course items:\n1) Foie gras dish with a drink - didn't try\n2) Seared Day Boat Scallops on fennel puree, endive, blood orange vinaigrette \n- pretty good flavor with alots of side condiments to enhance the plate\n3) Beef tenderloin\n-Fiancee loved this dish\n4) Dessert - ?\n-Somehow i can't remember his dessert. It was some sort of cake we gobbled down but slipped from my memory\n\nThe restaurant chef came out towards the end of the night to greet every table which was a nice added touch to the meal experience.\n\nAfter all that food and 3 glasses of wine between us on top of a cappuccino & a plate of petit fours (2 of the 4 were super delicious, btw), we left happily satisfied.\n\nUntil the next special occasion!", "author": "Jackie L."}

An amazingly buttery torchon on top of peanut brittle.. this was amazing. This came with some apple barbequed squab, and onion and strawberry compote. This was an interesting array of flavors, as the peanut brittle and strawberry compote was reminiscent of PB and J, while the torchon added an extra layer of richness. After trying this, it makes me want to try the PB and J and Foie Gras combos at other restaurants. Needless to say, the 3 sweet profiles were calmed down by the foie's butteriness. Pro-tip: use the table bread for the remainder of the foie that you don't finish with the dish.\n\nSeared Foie Gras - oh my god. The flavor profiles here were immense... a perfectly seared large piece of foie on top of caramelized cherries and a maple sauce... the kicker is the light use of star anais and vanilla, which were light but noticeable throughout this dish. My eyes rolled back... this dish was freaking orgasmic and its almost a crime that this will no longer be served. Fatty and rich, delicate, all with some spice from the vanilla and star anais to wake up your taste buds and the acidity from the cherries to stop it from being overwhelming... I don't know what to say. If I had to pick between this and GD's, it would run down if I prefer citrus or cherries with my foie that night.\n\nFoie Gras and Scallops - super rich and delicate. The scallops were a little closer to medium than medium rare. The potatoes and asparagus added several layers of texture, while the truffle sauce further pushed that this dish is opulence for your taste buds.\n\nThroughout the meal, we were also treated with other items:\n\n- Foie gras mousse with Bacon and Strawberry - smoky buttery and sweet. The order of taste went foie to smoky bacon to strawberry finisher\n- Leek Soup in Farm Egg - amazing. I believe it was a thin piece of lightly toasted brioche on top that you would put the soup and egg yolk on. Oh man, this took me by surprise how rich and oniony this tasted. So good.\n\nWe also received some after dinner chocolates at the end, all of which were very good, but I could not get over how good this dinner was.", "author": "Marc T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-17", "description": "My boyfriend and I came to La Folie for a late birthday dinner for me since I was given a gift certificate to this place.  Never been before but we checked out the yelp reviews beforehand and all the reviews are pretty spot on.  \n\nFOOD:\n\nWe did the 5 course meal for each of us and it was so delicious!  I had no idea when I made the reservation that because of the foie gras ban, this month has been heinous for making last minute reservations or changes to reservations because everyone is trying to get their foie gras in before the state bans it in July.  Needless to say, our original intentions of coming here were just to have dinner, but as soon as the server explained to us the foie gras situation, I couldn't pass it up. \n\nMy boyfriend had the following items:\n- baby heirloom beets salad \n- hudson valley foie gras torchon \n- slow roasted wild king salmon \n- liberty farm duck breast \n- warm edam cheese souffle \n\nI had the following:\n- hudson valley foie gras torchon\n- warm pig feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine\n- seared day boat scallop and foie gras rossini\n- trio of rabbit\n- chocolate fondant\n\nEverything my boyfriend had was absolutely delicious (yes, I ate most of his than mine lol)!!  Many of the dishes you have to eat in a specific way with specific pairings to make sure you're getting the proper taste as the chef intended.  I am not so great with that and rather impatient so I tend to just shovel all of it into my mouth at once or eat each item separately until I'm finished.  Not the way to go.  But as I was saying, I would recommend everything my boyfriend had as each one was cooked deliciously and he had the proper taste of everything with his choices.  My dishes were cooked well and they were also great, but I think my dishes were all too heavy so by the time the trio of rabbit came, I was unable to eat it and had to pack it to go.  I'm also not a big fan of foie gras so lesson learned in jumping on the bandwagon and trying to be greedy.  By the time the rabbit came, I was so sick of liver (the trio comes with rabbit liver, loin, and leg meat), I was already really turned off.  But that's just me.  For all you foie gras lovers out there, it was cooked wonderfully and this is definitely the best place to get it (my boyfriend can attest to it!). \n\nSERVCE:\n\nJust like most fine dining establishments, the service here was impeccable.  From the moment we sat down to the moment we walked out of this place, the service is absolutely the best and in some ways, is just a great production.  Everyone is so synchronized and \"choreographed\" and seem to have the pulse on every guests in the restaurant.  This made the experience for us even more wonderful.  Every time I got up to go use the restroom, one of the staff members would come by and fold my napkin while I was gone.  As we were leaving, we were thanked by all the staff members and then as we proceeded to head out the door, was handed our to go items with a thank you and good bye.  It was awesome!! Our server was great about explaining each item to us when we received them.  \n\nPARKING:\n\nParking can be a big pain in the butt.  Luckily our reservations were at 6 pm so we at least had hope of finding something if we circled the block a few times.  The restaurant does have a valet service for $15 so I'd suggest that if your reservations are after 7 or 8 pm, you should valet.  We came on a Saturday night so I'm sure had we had reservations at 7 pm, we would've had to valet for sure.  The streets were so busy and full of people when we finished our dinner.  \n\nOverall, everything was wonderful!  My only qualm is that it took us 4 hours to eat dinner.  I'm usually a very on the go type of person and I understand that this is fine dining so it's the experience that we have to lavish in.  I'm just not much of a sit down, and stay for hours to eat, type of person.  But that's just my own personal preference.  It has nothing to do with La Folie and in fact I'm sure that they welcome people to stay (which is what most people like) and there's no sense of rushing.  I'm just saying, sometimes I like a bit of rush :)", "author": "Joyce C."}

(I am salivating at the remembrance of it.)  This tasty dish wasn't a standard dish on the menu, but an upgrade - actually, 2 upgrades, so for the price, if it wasn't ridiculously tasty, there would have been mutiny.\n\nIt's unfair to dock a star on probably of the busiest restaurant nights of the year and generally, I wouldn't -I'd only deduct 1/2 a star for that, but Yelp won't let me -  but we were seated late almost 30 mins late.

We arrived and were quickly escorted to a fabulous table with a great view of the entire restaurant.  The decor is understated and elegant.  \n\nHeidi arrive to start our evening off with our drink order (very good martinis, by the way) and proceeded to explain, in detail, the signature dishes on the menu.  We then received our first of several amuse bouches, the first being salmon and marscapone lollipops.  They were delicious, and gave us just a taste of all the deliciousness that was yet to come. \n\nWe then received a second amuse bouche: this was an asparagus tip, served on a spoon of brown butter and lemon juice.  It was also delicious.\n\nFor our first course, I ordered the heirloom beet salad over a beet tartar.  It was fabulously refreshing and the beets were so tender and flavorful.  My mother had the frog legs which were also quite tasty and my father had the dungegrass crab salad, which he really loved, but I did not like.\n\nI abstained from a second course, but my mother had the butter poached lobster and my father had the scallop.  I did not try the scallop (as there was only one) but my father devoured it, mentioning between bites how delicious it was.  I managed to get a bite of the butter poached lobster, which was good, but very rich, due to all the butter it was cooked in.  \n\nFor the third course, we all had the quail stuffed with squab topped with shaved black truffles (a $15 supplement per person).  This was absolutely one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The meat was so tender and flavorful and despite the fact that I was stuffed, I didn't want the dish to end.\n\nFor my third and final course, I ordered the edam cheese souffl\u00e9, as so many of my fellow Yelpers have raved about it.  Can I tell you, this was like eating a little bit of heaven.  It's not too rich, despite the fact that it's cheese, but surprisingly light and packed with flavor.  \n\nI would have to say, that this is my favorite restaurant thus far in San Francisco and we've been to some really great ones so far.  They definitely earned that Michelin star!", "author": "Courtney S."}

Here's why:\n\nThe food -- nay, the feast -- was spectacular. I've never heard or uttered more oh-my-god's in all my life, nor have I had so many joyous explosions in my mouth. *wink wink* All the flavors and textures were well balanced, and the portions were beyond generous. My favorite of the night was the Warm Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine. Other highlights included the Seared Foie Gras (4+ oz of heart-stopping goodness), Butter Poached Lobster (extra $20 for truffle shavings to top your lobster-truffle sauce), and Duck Breast with Smoked Duck Tongue.

Looking at Yelp, I decided to reserve for La Folie since the ratings were pretty good.\n\nWe arrived for our dinner on a Tuesday and we were the first to be there and were seated promptly.  We decided to try the Chef's Tasting Menu ($110) and 4 course menu ($90) along with an oz of caviar ($115).\n\nThe caviar was excellent and foie gras were really tasty but the rest were just so-so.  We were given some chef's amuse to try.  Some were ok and some were just so so.  Overall, I'll have to rate this lower than Fleur De Lys as my experience at Fleur De Lys was memorable.

We moved on to the \"Le Beouf\" which came with a beef tenderloin cut, a short rib, and a mini slider in which the beef patty was mixed with foie gras and truffles I believe, and the Butter Poached Lobster.  I think for this match-up, the Le Beouf was the clear winner.  Finally, for dessert, we had the Cheese Souffle and the Huckleberry Alaska.  The Alaska was a tad bit too sweet for my taste.

Everything on the menu sounds amazing so it was tough to go wrong.\n\nFor our day they brought out some fresh black truffles, offering them as a compliment to any dish.  My girlfriend is lactose intolerant and made this known to the chef.  To our great surprise, the chef used the black truffle to create a new amuse bouche just for her and modified her appetizer using more truffle and mushrooms.  The chef really knows what he is doing and it's always great when the restaurant goes out of their way to accommodate her.\n\nAll the dishes were amazing, but the one that really stood out to me was the foie gras.  At most places if you order a foie gras dish you'll probably get a few slices, but here we each got an entire foie gras 'filet.'  It was truly a special treat and something I have not seen at any place else in the United States so far.\n\nThroughout the meal our server was very friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.

Just as other reviewers, the portions are larger than what you would typically expect, so 3 courses, with some delightful amuse bouche, were more than enough to satiate our appetites.  We did skip the desserts (however, by the looks of our neighboring diners, all looked delicious and appeared satisfied!) and focused on delicately yet mouthwatering seafood dishes all cooked to perfection.  Anything featuring scallops seemed to particularly shine but I also couldn't stop myself from eating the lobster risotto...tasted so buttery and rich!", "author": "Sheri H."}

I forgot that 5 courses is actually too much of a good thing.\n\nI started off with the Dungeness crab salad which after the Amuse bouche was a nice way to start the meal.  Next was a ginormous serving of the seared Hudson Valley foie gras.  Yum.  Sadly this may be no more after the new year.  The next course was the butter poached lobster, which was nice, but the pasta had a rather offputting texture.  The final dinner dish was the beef (er Le boeuf) which was some of the most tender flavorful beef Ive had.  Desert was the peanut butter opera cake with curry ice cream.  That was a fun dish to put a little bit of everything on the spoon and then sit back and enjoy the party in your mouth.\n\nIt's nice to be able to go back to a place and get consistently excellent food and service.

We opted for the 5 course dinner each which did not disappoint.  Our waitress Mandi was attentive but not over bearing and was very sensitive to your food restrictions.\n\nMy menu\n1.  Asian Beet Salad with Goat Cheese - Delicious best beet salad I have ever had wonderful flavor\n2.  Butter Poached Lobster - Lobster itself was amazing both my husband and I loved it.  The Kale salad on top lacked crispiness and the sauce was a bit sweet for the lobster itself\n3.  Lamb Chop - OMG OMG I could live off this and only this for the rest of my life.  Best lamb chop I've ever had.  It was so tender it melted in my mouth the sear was amazing and I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate.  \n4.  Cheese Platter - was amazing and so fun\n5.  Chocolate Bread Pudding with Basil sorbet - very good and I ordered a Latte with it which was one of the best lattes I have ever had\n\nMy Husband's menu\n1.  Cauliflower Soup - his favorite course said it was the best soup he's ever had, he loved the lobster in it.\n2.  Black Cod - liked the dish but didn't like the skin on the fish\n3.  Quail - really enjoyed the quail he LOVED the sauce he wanted to lick it off the plate\n4.  Cheese Plate - he had different cheeses than me and he said his goat cheese was amazing he let the chef pick his cheese\n5.  Apple Tart with Marker's Mark sorbet - he isn't a sweet person and finished the whole dish\n\nWe were SO full we started boxing things up around the third course.  We also had 4 amuse bouches all very good.  My husband enjoyed the broth with the egg yolk the most one of his favorite parts of the meal.  A nice touch was the Happy Anniversary on our dessert plates also we were a half hour early for our reservation and were sat right away which was a very nice touch.  The tables were close together but I never over heard anyone's conversation.  We were there almost 4 hours and never felt rushed.  One of the best meals I have ever had.", "author": "Chrissy F."}

The portion was huge! But that doesn't mean that the taste or texture of it was compromised in any way. It was prepared wonderfully. Luckily, it was cherry season, and they had this delicious cherry sauce instead of the usual apple one that it normally comes in. (which my friend says it probably isn't as delicious as the cherry one)  \n\nFoie Gras torchon: It's the pate style, so it's not as buttery of course. It was still good. Just a different kind of richness. The squab that it comes with was perfectly cooked. (I believe this was better than the quail and squab combo's squab) It came with two sauces. and some cheese and salt. yummy! \n\nFoie gras with scallop: once again delicious! would definitely come back just for scallops since foie gras would no longer be here. =( \n\nPoached Lobster: OMG, next best dish next to the seared foie gras. THE SWEETNESS of the lobster came through in every bite. HEAVEN! The pea ravioli with the truffle oil was sooo delicious, that my bf forgot to share with me hehe. \n\nQuail and Squab combo: Not really a big fan, this was the only slight disappointment we had. It tasted so much like the chinese vegetarian dish with the mushroom on it. I don't know but I realized (a little too late) that those asian mushrooms in any cuisine is not appealing to me. It's my personal preference though. We should have gotten the duck breast. \n\nrack of lamb: very strong lamb taste, so beware if you can't take that strong lamb then this is definitely not the dish for you. It came with this very salt sausage. Again the meat dish didn't really WOW me. but the lamb was better than the quail and squab. that's all i have to say about it. \n\ndessert we had the molten cake with green tea: YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!! goo-ie green tea sauce in the middle. so delicious!!! with ice cream oh man yummy! \n\nthe service was excellent as well. despite the fact they did forget my cosmopolitan in the beginning, but he made it so delicious that it didn't matter it came late. =) \n\nvery attentive server and he was explaining everything thoroughly. he was a cheery guy and it made the dinner that much better. \n\nSAD FOIE GRAS will no longer be served but would come back for their lobster for sure and try other goodness on their menu.", "author": "Christina N."}

The back room feels like you are being transported back to the 1800s-- beautiful decorative green wallpaper, and dim lighting coming from chandeliers.

This evening we went to La Folie for a wedding anniversary.  It was our first experience at this San Francisco establishment and we were disappointed.\n\nIt was an unusually warm evening in San Francisco and we were seated in the rear dining room.  The air conditioner was insufficient to make the room comfortable.  A number of dining guests at other tables concurred.  Although the room was well appointed and the staff attentive we were stuck where we were.  It  would be of value to improve the ventilation and air conditioning of the rear dining area and/or close the area on such hot evenings.  The forecast predicted well in advance this very warm weekend in S.F.\n\nThe food was well presented and satisfying but not memorable.  A four-plus rated French restaurant should have produced at least one uniquely memorable course during an evening of dining.  Their Consomm\u00e9s and Gastriques were standard fair lacking innovation and character.  We dined on duck and lamb that was appropriately cooked but offered  flavors that were too subdued and lacking any  synthesis with the accompaniments surrounding these meats.\n\n\nThe chef  garnished the plates with many unique ingredients but few of them melded together to produce that unique tasteful symphony that one look forward to when eating in such an establishment.\n\nThe Amuse-bouches were artfully presented (as expected) but if the purpose was to showcase the whimsical nature of the chef.....yikes.  These small culinary adventures between courses when presented by  master chefs are often the highlights of a dining experience.  Not a one at La Folie  triggered even the remotest of commentary between us other then  our disappointment.\n\nIn summary, for the first time diner in a French Restaurant I'm sure that La Folie seems like quite the culinary adventure.  To the more seasoned diner, and I realize that sounds snobbish but this is a review, they should significantly try to up their game.", "author": "Yehoshua S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-10", "description": "La Folie is amazing. It also made me extremely poor afterwards. \nIt is extremely limited in seating because it's a small, intimate restaurant and prepare to be there for a while, because each meal is about 2-3 hours long. \n\nI've been here twice already, and I think the part that really impressed me is how consistent this place is with the quality of food, the aesthetics of the food, and the technical skills involved. The chef behind this restaurant is a genius. \n\nI think the part that gets me the most about La Folie is the experience of being able to create your own course meal. They have a list of items you can choose from, and you can create 3,4 or 5 courses ($85,95,105 respectively, I think). They also have a Chef's Special course menu (5 courses for $115), of which you can take one dish as part of your own course meal for a $10 supplement. It's a cool and interactive concept. \n\nWarning: unless you are a 500 pound tyrannosaurus rex, you will most likely be unable to finish all 5 courses without feeling absolutely disgusting or wanting to throw up. So, even though the eye wanders and wants to try 5 different dishes, I would say, try to stay away from getting 5 courses. Trust me, I tried (with one of my guy friends) the 5 course meal the first time I visited and we both left feeling miserable. Our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs. And here's why. \n\nAfter you've order your course, they start you off with a few amuse bouche (small complimentary starting dishes courtesy of the chef). At my most recent visit, I was able to try monkfish liver mousse and a poached egg yolk with a type of soup inside. \n-monkfish liver mousse: Monkfish liver for me is a hit or miss. That being said, I didn't really enjoy this monkfish liver mousse. It was too fishy, almost had a silver metal taste. Definitely not my favorite. \n-Poached egg yolk soup: I had this the first and the second time I visited (with different soups inside) and I think the idea and the execution behind this is absolutely genius, stunning, and delicious. An extremely thin crisp potato chip tops this with a tiny toasted slice of bread on the side for you to mix the poached egg yolk and the soup together. \n\nThen you start your series of courses. So far I've tried: \n-the tastings of passat roe: I liked the raw sashimi on the plate. the passat roe itself, not so much. But roe in general is not really something my taste buds enjoy, so that was just a mistake on my part ordering this dish. Otherwise, I think it could be a very fresh and clean dish for those who enjoy roe. \n-corn and lobster soup: Absolutely delicious. it was just the right level of sweetness from the flavors of the corn, and small bits of lobster inside. The waiter brought the plate with the lobster in it, and the soup on the side and poured it in for me so it was just the right temperature. I know it was just soup, but seriously one of the best soups I had. I would order it again. \n-lobster and mushroom risotto: delicious. the risotto is just rich enough to savor the mushrooms and the rice was on the creamy side, but the lobster pieces cut through the richness and creaminess just enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed after I finished the dish. \n-Duck breast and confit: I like it. I don't LOVE it. the duck breast is cooked perfectly, but the duck confit on the side is just okay, and i didn't enjoy the smoked duck tongue. If I'm going to pay $100+ for a meal, I would want a dish where I can eat the entire plate and the busboy in the  back doesn't even have to wash the dishes because i cleaned it off so well (well, i guess i'm sort of exaggerating) \n-bay scallop over squid ink spaghetti topped with uni: one of the best dishes I had so far. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente and actually tasted of squid ink. the bay scallop was the softest scallop I had tasted in my life. \n-Butter poached lobster with parsnip ravioli: my boyfriend got this one, and he said it was really good. I tried a bite of the dish too and it was really good! the ravioli was really soft and not starchy, and of course, the lobster was absolutely divine. Even the crispy kale and salad on top was great. \n-Roti of Quail and Squab: their signature dish. And there's a reason why. They take wild mushrooms, quail, and squab and wrap it all in this crispy potato wrap and cook it. It's an extreme use of technical skills and really really good. The meats are cooked perfectly, potato wrap perfectly crisp. This is definitely a must get. \n-Baked Alaska: my favorite dessert at La Folie of all times. the one and only dish that actually got me through my 5 course meal without feeling completely miserable. It was that good. \n\nOverall the food is worth only 4 stars, but I gave it that extra star because compared to other $$$$ restaurants in SF, it's cheaper and the price is worth every penny for its quality and consistency of the food.", "author": "Judy B."}

I came here with my bf for our 5 year anniversary and it was such a nice dining experience. We wanted to eat somewhere really nice, but also wanted to make sure we were getting our money's worth. The option of the 3, 4, or 5 course meal is what drew me in.\n\nWe had a bit of trouble finding this place, as the sign is a bit small and it was pretty dark that night. They had valet available for $15, which is definitely one of the better options considering that parking was hard to find, and much more expense elsewhere. Also, because I wasn't trying to walk a far distance in heels in the cold SF weather .. Haha. This place is a bit on the smaller side and has a very intimate environment. Our servers were all so friendly and gave us descriptions of each dish as they came out. Some additional treats came out in addition to the 3 course meals the bf and I both ordered. I forgot what the very first amuse bouche was .. but here is what I do remember!\n\nWe started off with 2 glasses of champagne, Brut. Yummy and nice way to start off our meal.\n\nSoft Poached Egg with Fried Potato Crisp and Toasted Buttered Brioche - For something so small it was so full of flavor. The brioche and potato crisp both added a nice variety of textures. \nCured Salmon and Marscapone Lollipops - Also very good and was so nicely presented.\n\nNow for our 3 course meals ..\nSauteed Burgundy Snails - Served in veal bone marrow with a nice lemon butter. Again, nice presentation and great flavor. \nPan Roasted Halibut - This dish was perfectly cooked, but the flavor didn't amaze us like the other dishes.\nSeared Duck Breast with Duck Confit - SOO good. One of our favorites out of everything. Probably the best duck I've ever had. I was a bit hesitant as it was paired with different fruits like peaches and blueberries. However, these flavors married very well and it was such a great pairing. I highly recommend this dish. \n\nWarm Pig Feet - I had to order this since I saw so many reviews on it. Best decision ever!! Another one of our favorites of the night. It had a melt in your mouth texture, yet the outside was slightly crispy. It was a bit heavy, so I was nice and shared most of it (:\nButter Poached Lobster on a Butternut Squash Ravioli - We both agreed this was really delicious. Cooked perfectly, great flavor and presentation. The ravioli was a very nice addition. \nRoti of Quail and Squab - Also good, but not a huge fan. It was a bit on the salty side. I did enjoy the quail egg basket though!\n\nAt this point we were both stuffed .. but as I say, there's always room for dessert!\nPetit Fours - All very yummy. We were both enjoyed the two chocolate ones.\n\nOverall, a great place to dine and we both would recommend this place to others!", "author": "Malyssa C."}

We didn't go with the Foie Gras tasting menu because as much as I love me some Foie, sometimes too much of a good thing can be just that.  We ordered the 4 course menu and of course that included the Hudson Seared Foie as one of the courses.\n\nOur waiter presented us with 2 amuse bouches before our meal began.  The first was a foie gras mouse with nuts on top.  It was delectable and made even my husband who isn't a big foie fan appreciate it's silky goodness. The second was a clever egg soup with brioche for dipping and a potato chip top.  It was very cute, and presented nicely.\n\nNow onto the main meal... My first course was the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with cherries.  I am one of those girls who loves to mix my sweets and salty foods together, and add the fatty goodness of foie and that is sure to give me a foodgasm.  It was just that.  What I loved most about this foie over others, is that is was a very generous portion, and the foodgasm wasn't just for a moment, but lasted a good 5 minutes as I devoured the dish.\n\nMy second course was the poached lobster on a pea ravioli.  This dish was light, and beautifully composed of complementing flavors.  This was also my husband's favorite dish of the night.\n\nThe third course was the rack of lamb, medium rare.  It was juicy and a nice meat dish.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Lamb Tongue with the summer squash, but again the meat was flavorful.  I also tried my hubs Roti of Quail and Squab.  It was okay, we both preferred the rack of lamb over the Roti.\n\nThe final course was dessert.  I ordered the chocolate fondant expecting a molton lava explosion, and what I got was a bit lack luster, and made me wish that I had ordered a soup and salad instead of the dessert, as my friends did.  In all honestly, I enjoyed the free little dessert bites that they gave us more than my actual dessert.\n\nAll in all... Gary Danko still has been my favorite meal to date.  Yet, La Folie is wonderful and you definitely get a lot of quality food, and service for the money.  I am very happy that my farewell to Foie occurred here.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

Everything about this place was perfect. \n\nI came here with my boyfriend and I got the three course, he the four course which was the perfect amount of food for us. They definitely don't skimp on portions. \n\nThe restaurant itself was smaller than I expected but it has a great red interior. We came around 6 on a Tuesday night (with a reservation) and the place was mostly empty at first, but around 7 most of the restaurant was full. The woman who was our waitress was very polite in answering our questions and described all of the dishes very well. \n\nThe amuse bouches (ours was a wonton...thing and a poached egg yolk topped with a potato crisp) were delectable and were good in clearing our palates (as well as spoiling us). Probably my favorite part of the dinner.\n\nFor appetizers we got the goat cheese tatin & Hudson Valley foie gras torchon. It was our first time trying foie gras and it tasted very buttery and was well-complemented with the fruit and peanut butter. We liked the goat cheese tatin a lot more though; I'd definitely recommend it. \n\nThen we got the lobster risotto and butter-poached lobster. We were hesitant about ordering two lobster dishes but we didn't regret it for one second. Both were so so good - the lobster broth in the risotto was so rich. The butter-poached lobster was soft and the pumpkin ravioli went really well with it. \n\nThen we got the lamb rack & \"le boeuf.\" The beef tenderloin was super tender and juicy and the braised short rib very sweet. The burger rossini was pretty mediocre. The lamb rack was great as well - lots of meat so we were completely full by the end of our meal. \n\nLastly we got the cheese souffle which was the perfect way to end the night - very fluffy and warm and well complemented with the cold sorbet they give it with. \n\nOverall I would definitely go here again (and again) to try the chef's tasting as well as the other menu items.

I live in the area and have walked by countless times but had never been inside. It's actually pretty small and honestly not very impressive, but the staff is very attentive and greeted us quickly. We brought a special champagne to celebrate an anniversary and they promptly plopped it in a bucket of ice and began pouring when we were seated.\n\nCutting to the point of this, here's what I had... escargots... not bad but I've had better in France. I know that sounds pretentious, but I'm just being honest, the snails I had in france were a little more plump and the sauce was better (read: more butter). I sampled my wife's goat cheese tatin and it was excellent, I'd get that next time.\n\nSecond course was the divers scallop. This was absolutely divine. Perfectly cooked, with a nice crispiness on top, accompanied by a delicious sauce and the most beautiful carrots and peas you could get. Not sure why I call them beautiful as the buzz of the champagne has long since worn off, but they were very good.\n\nOn to the beef tenderloin. This dish is what single handedly gives La Folie 5 stars. It.was.incredible. There's a $20 supplement, but definitely worth it. I'm not even sure how the Wagyu could have been better as this was so tender and delicious. There's a little short rib action, a little filet, and then a slider. They're all great but the filet was my favorite, it had a nice searing on the outside and perfect medium rare inside. My wife liked her rabbit trio, but I think the tenderloin took top honors.\n\nFor dessert I had the cheeses, which were good but I was still thinking about the meat.\n\nIf you have a special occasion coming up or a corporate amex, this place should be at the top of one's list, absolutely delicious.", "author": "Jeff O."}

Where else can you get a filet of foie gras or a gigantic pair of juicy, tender lamb chops grilled to perfection?  In addition to the warm and moist bread with a crisp crunch on the outside, you're treated to a variety of amuse bouches in between your 5-course meal.  If you're really hungry, you can even add a sixth course, starting with a foie gras soup.  Be sure to end on a sweet note with either a selection of some of the finest cheeses or a balanced pairing of a sweet sorbet and savory cheese souffle with bacon bits.  Don't worry, you'll receive some additional treats at the end of the meal with your bill to sweeten your indulgence and cleanse your palate.  For two people, expect to spend about $600 especially if you drink and eat as if you're at the mini-local version of French Laundry with twice the portions.\n\nThe service is impeccable with a friendly and helpful wait staff who serve with a smile and desire to make your meal memorable.  The ambiance is warm and inviting with cushioned seats in an elegant, classy dining room.  Feel free to hang out at the lounge next door before and after your meal.  Parking is tough on the street, but the valet can help you for $15 unless you'd like to park for $30 in the public lot two blocks down.", "author": "Jenny L."}

Very strange but since we booked our ressies on open table there could have been some system gliche as that has happened to us before with other restos.   Now if you know of La Folie, it's not the type of resto where you can't just walk in any day any time and have tables available for you.  It's very nice fine dining establishment where ressies are usually made weeks in advance.  So when the hostess couldn't find our ressies a frown started forming on my face...but luckily chef roland came to the rescue!  He just so happened to be walking out of the kitchen and spotted me...came over to greet us and immediately instructed the hostess to seat us.  As regulars at the La Folie lounge next door, we have met chef Roland several times and he is the most friendly and personable chef/owner I've ever met!\n\nWe were seated in the back room which is much more quaint and quiet so be sure to request that for your next dining experience here.  We were greeted by our friendly server, Caley, who we learn throughout our 4 hour dining experience is very informative and patient!\n\nWe usually prefer to bring out own wine but no need to as La Folie's wine list is very extensive which includes many varietals and a wide price range.  The sommelier assisted us in selecting the perfect bottle of bordeaux which we were very happy with.\n\nThen came the selections for our meal...3 courses, 4 courses or 5 courses?  We both decided on 5 courses as everything looked so good.  Note that it only took us 30mins to finally decide on which 5 courses we wanted! (yes it was that difficult!)  So here it goes...\n\nComplimentary apps:\n-Salmon lollipops...not only were they super cute but also super tasty\n-Octopus and scallop salad...a total tease as it was two tiny little pieces\n\n1st course:\n-Flash fried duck egg on top of a potato pancake filled w/sweetbreads and topped w/shaved black truffles...OUTSTANDING\n-Soup w/seared foie gras...the very foamy soup was ok but the foie gras just melts in your mouth\n\n2nd course:\n-Lobster and mushroom risotto...did not have to dig around for pieces of lobster cause there were plenty...SO tasty\n-Warm pigs feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine...a bit too salty but was a great combination\n\n3rd course:\n-Pan seared durade w/handmade gnocchis on top of sweet potato pieces...OUTSTANDING...fish was moist and crispy, gnoccchis just melts in your mouth\n-Poached butterfish...the fish was a bit overcooked but the lobster and uni reduction was outstanding\n\n4th course:\n-Butter poached lobster on top of butternut squash ravioli...OUTSTANDING...1/2 tail and one claw and a giant tasty ravioli\n-Quail and squab stuffed with mushrooms wrapped with crispy potato strings...OUTSTANDING...1/2 grilled quail and 3 large pieces of squab cooked to perfection\n\n5th course:\n-Rack of lamb and pieces of lamb tongue...OUTSTANDING...2 large pieces cooked to perfection\n-Had ordered dessert but had to cancel it as we couldn't even finish our other courses...our server kindly allowed me to just stick with 4 courses.\n\nObviously our eyes were bigger than our stomachs when we first arrived...after 4 hours of eating we practically had to roll ourselves out!  The waiter had warned us about the quantity of food that was ahead of us but our eyes were too greedy...so we ended up taking 2 boxes home.\n\nThis has been one of the best dining experiences ever...from food to service to environment.

There are a lot of options for putting together your own meal and you can choose between 3 courses - $80, 4 courses - $90, or 5 courses - $100.\n\nMy husband and I both did 5 courses. Everything was good but the following dishes really stood out.\n\nSeared Foie Gras with Spice Poached Apple and Apple Consomm\u00e9 - This dish is definitely worth the 10.00 supplement. It was a huge portion, almost the amount you'd normally expect from a piece of meat! It was seared perfectly and melted in my mouth.\n\nSeared Black Cod with Mushrooms - My husband and I both ordered this and it was delicious! The fish was crispy on the outside but super soft inside. The mushrooms went well with it and also had a truffle sauce.\n\nRack of Lamb with Butter Beans - The meat was a perfect medium rare and seasoned well. I also appreciated the fact that they let me substitute the beans for veggies.\n\nDuring your meal you will get amuse bouches which is always fun. For a supplement you can also add truffles onto pretty much any dish you want! They bring the truffles to your table in a fancy box to tempt you. The smell is absolutely divine!! In addition, the service is terrific and the restaurant is dim and romantic which makes for a nice spot for a fancy date.", "author": "Alice J."}

We left very pleasantly stuffed, along with a doggie bag containing half of my wife's lamb course.\nWhen the owner came around to say hello and ask how we were doing the conversation went from friendly to dark, as we spoke for several minutes of the madness of the Paris terrorist attack that happened yesterday.

I felt a little under-dressed that night as most of the diners seemed to be there to celebrate special occasions and I simply went to try out a new restaurant. \n\nI loved all the amuse bouche that the chef served before the starting of the actual tasting.

My husband and I haven't had such a fantastic meal since The Dining Room about 5 years ago. We came on a Wednesday night for hubby's birthday and was seated promptly (a plus). Service was excellent (plus plus) and the food was to die for (A+++++++++).\n\nI decided to order the 3 course meal and my husband had the 4 course so that we can share the dessert.  I loved everything I ordered:\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Burgundy Snails in Bone Marrow - WOW!!! I have never had such an amazingly delicious appetizer before.  I usually don't eat snails nor am I big fan of bone marrow but this dish blew me away.  Not only was the presentation beautiful (snails were stuffed in a giant bone marrow) but the taste of the snails with the crunchiness of the bone marrow top had me going \"mmmm\" with every bite.  \n\nNext I had the seared diver scallop.  It was good and i liked the carrots and peas were chopped up into little round chunks.\n\nMy last course was the lobster & mushroom risotto. To add to the impeccable service rating, our waiter brought out the truffle of the day for us to ooohh and ahhh over and also to take a sniff. He highly recommended some shavings in my risotto (which I did end up getting).\n\nHusband had:\nSeared Foie Gras - very large portion (almost like a mini 6oz steak). Cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. Loved loved loved the carmelized peaches. Complimented the saltiness of the foie gras perfectly. The whole thing just melts in your mouth.\n\nTempura duck egg - he was kind of \"meh\" about this dish. It came out as a semi cooked egg. \n\nLamb rack - cooked perfectly. Good size portion. Lamb tongue was interesting.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Baked Alaska. Really cute dessert with a meringue topping. The meringue was fun to eat, not overly sweet and the panna cotta underneath was really good.\n\nI can't wait to come back to La Folie!", "author": "Terry D."}

The food and the servers were exceptional.  The only liability to this restaurant is the woman who takes reservations... this is our story:\n\nWe were reading a list of the top 10 restaurants in San Francisco.  La Folie caught our eye.  I checked on Open Table and there were NO reservations available for that evening (we were checking about 1 pm).\n\nSo, I decided to call the restaurant directly.  I asked if there were any reservations for that night, and the woman seemed upset that I would even ask and then, with a very heavy French accent (I assume) said, I have one cancellation for 5:30, what is your credit card number?  I gave her the number and then she asked for my telephone number.  When I stated, 6-5-0, she stopped me and said, \"YOU ARE COMING FROM THE SOUTH BAY??\" I interrupted her and said I'm actually coming from the East Bay.\n\nShe preceded to say, \"then please be prompt!  We have a very busy night ahead of us! I need you to be on time!\"\n\nSo... if you can get past this customer service-less reservation lady, the food and the service was sensational!\n\nThat's my two cents worth!", "author": "David M."}

It was quite nice.\n\nWe arrived a little bit early for our 9:15 dinner reservation so killed some time in the La Folie Lounge next door.  This is a good idea for those restaurants that have a very small bar area that quickly gets crowded for the next round of diners waiting for the tables to turn.  Our cocktails, rum & ginger and cucumber caipiroska, were prepared promptly and were very tasty.  I thought it was a nice touch that the server/bartender gave us waters without us asking.\n\nI took one star off for the wait.  It was at least 30 minutes before we sat down at our table.\n\nWe had 2 amuse bouche:  the first a fois gras mousse (yummy!) and the 2nd was a poached egg in the shell; also yummy and I loved the presentation!\n\nHe had the 4 course menu and I, the 3 course menu.\n\nBf's dishes:\n1st - beef & oxtail consomme.  This was very tasty; i thought the bouillon cubes were an interest touch.\n\n2nd - warm pig feet, sweetbread, and lobster terrine; i wasn't impressed with this dish.\n\n3rd - daurade; fish that was similar to sea bass - loved the crispy skin!\n\n4th - quail and squab; beautiful presentation and very tasty.\n\nmine:\n1st - lobster corn soup; very creamy flavorful soup, the chunks of lobster meat complemented the soup but i could've done w/o the claw meat.\n\n2nd - seared hudson valley foie gras with huckleberries & maple syrup.  Becky! OMG look at the size of that...LIVER!!!  the last and only time i was wowed by foie gras size was at Taillevent.  This foie gras had to have come from a goose!  so huge!  So I understand Yuchi's gripe about the foie gras being so huge that it overpowered the rest of her meal.  One thing i wished the server had told us was that we could share our plates which we realized when my bf's 3rd course came out.  I thought i'd be playing with my bread (served warm btw) while he enjoyed his fish course.  If one chose a 3-course menu and the other a 4-course or even 5, the server will bring out extra plates so you can share, for a 2-top anyway.  So this foie gras was made for sharing!  The only complaint was the toasted brioche was too hard to cut through.  I was happy with the fois gras by itself though!\n\n3rd:  lamb served 2 ways.  I remember the rack of lamb with the long bone that begged to picked up like a caveman.  Oh and the lamb tongue, that was d\u00e9licieux!\n\nFor our meal the sommelier recommended 2 wines: the Goldeneye Pinot Noir from Duckhorn and the Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape (which I would've chosen).  The pinot noir ended up being the perfect accent to our dishes.\n\nSadly we had no room for dessert as the cheese souffle looked pretty tempting.  Hopefully we'll get a chance to come back as we kept looking at the other diners' dishes.  I like La Folie!\n\nI forgot my camera so took pics with my iphone and uploaded what I remembered to take pictures of.", "author": "Marie T."}

You already know the place is going to be good when you are wow'ed before any of the courses you actually ordered come.   \n\nYou get your choice of 3, 4, or 5 courses.

We celebrated my 40th birthday with dinner at the French Laundry, so that's the standard by which I measure other tiptop restaurants. La Folie was very, very good. \n\nWhen I made the reservations I asked for quiet romantic table, if possible. They took a table seating 4 and gave it to us, which meant lots of elbow room and a good distance between us and our neighbors. From then on, we knew we'd be treated well, and we weren't disappointed. The service was attentive but not hurried, and everyone was knowledgeable about the food and wine. \n\nWe started with caviar- and creme freche-topped blinis, followed by 2 amuse bouche: scallops then egg and brioche. For our mains my husband got his wish and had foie gras for each of his 3 courses, while I opted for terrine of pigs feet, sweetbreads and lobster, followed by poached lobster. Although we didn't order dessert, we were given a small selection of treats in honor of the birthday boy. Everything was delicious, including the 2001 Alsatian Riesling we had with dinner. \n\nWhile perhaps not as creative as the French Laundry, I appreciate La Folie's more relaxed approach to dinner (you can choose 2 or 3 courses or have the multi-course tasting menu) and their slightly larger portions. La Folie isn't cheap, but our meal there was half the price of dinner at French Laundry and every bit as satisfying.", "author": "Nancy B."}

This is my 3rd time here over the last 3 years, my first 2 experiences were fantastic and was excited to return for a 3rd round.\n\nThe food overall was good. Nothing was bad, but nothing was outstanding either. I first went with the crab salad, which was nice and fresh, but nothing exciting. Then I had the snails, I don't have snails often, so I don't know if snails were as somewhat tasteless as these were. I had the beef special, which were all good, but again, it's just your typical beef dish that's definitely of quality meat and cooked to perfection. But nothing about it stood out and definitely nothing about it was French. Lastly I had a strawberry dessert item, which was probably one of the more outstanding items during our dinner. Other dishes that were good too was the lamb, which my mom ordered, was really flavorful and was definitely worth ordering. The cod was also well cooked. One thing I will comment as well is that they haven't changed their menu at all in the last 3 years I've went here. Since almost a year ago, every dish is exactly the same as it once was (except the exclusion of Foie Gras). Seems they're running out of ideas for dishes?\n\nService was okay, our waiter was a little dry and was not very conversive. Chef Pasot actually came around and greeted everyone which was nice and a huge plus! Wine service was good too, they recommended a really nice Chardonnay from Santa Barbara. A huge negative was that my mom actually told them that we were celebrating my birthday and they didn't do anything special like a candle or anything, which was a bit of a turnoff. I quite frankly didn't care about a candle, but just the principle that a restaurant of this caliber should be very attentive of patrons celebrating a special event, huge blunder on their part. \n\nI don't know what it is, La Folie was once my favorite French restaurant in SF. I was initially blown away by the food, friendly service, and overall dining experience my first 2 times. This time around, I felt like I had a bit of a Gary Danko-esque experience. Impersonal service, good-not-great food, and messed up my mom's special request. I would usually say they might have been off their game that night, but to be honest, all the dishes were boring to me and there was almost nothing creative and nothing mind blowing. Maybe my taste has changed as I tend to lean towards prix-fixe spontaneous menus. Nonetheless, I felt like La Folie was lacking in almost every category and for the price you pay and the expectation they carry, I can say I won't be back for at least a good while.", "author": "Justin L."}

But not me. Not this girl. It was just a Tuesday for me. A girl has got to eat right? \n\nI had the honor of being taken out to La Folie last night by a friend. I was thrilled at the idea of being able to put on a nice new dress I had just picked up and wear my fancy dancing shoes. Upon arrival I was greeted at the door by the hostess. She took my coat and kindly sat me down at our table. The wait staff was amazing. Attentive, assertive and knowledgeable. Our waitress explained the entire menu to us thoroughly and thoughtfully. Our drinks came out in a timely matter. Our order was taken with the utmost ease. \n\nWe were giving 2 items for the amuse boucl\u00e9. Beautifully plated and tasted like heaven in a small bite. For dinner I chose the 4 course menu in which I picked my own items, 3 courses plus dessert. I chose the celery root soup, the beet salad, the duck breast and the bread pudding. Everything was amazing. I mean, I melted with each bite. The soup was plated table side and came with lobster and as a special treat to myself, I chose to top it with truffles.  The beet salad was interesting. Slightly pickled, sat on beef tartare and came with a goat cheese. By the time I got to the least beet I felt kind of pickled beet-ed out. The duck breast was the highlight of my night. 2 slices of duck breast topped with puff rice, sat with spinach topped with pieces of duck tongue and on the side was duck confit.  The bread pudding did not disappoint. Maker's mark ice cream? Hell yes. At this point I had to excuse myself to the restroom. I unzipped my dress and sit down for about 5 mins due to lack of oxygen and lack of room left in my dress. No joke. I even told the wait staff that they had to stop bringing food because I could not zip up my dress. Of course they did not listen to my request. After dessert we were given a tray of small chocolate bites and cookies. \n\nAll together I had a 7 course meal in a size 00 dress. Best part of the night was when my friend asked the Chef for a knife because I dropped mine. He didn't know it was him until I pointed it out. True story. Before we left I had the opportunity to thank the Chef and tell him how excellent dinner was. He came out sporadically during the meal to check up on everyone and even saw us on our way out. After the meal I could barely walk home. My friend had to drop me off 1.5 blocks away. \n\nThe entire experience was magical. I was extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to dine at La Folie.

I dined at La Folie for an anniversary/birthday dinner two nights ago and have been thinking about it ever since.  Everything from the service, to the plating, to the timing between courses was impeccable.  The restaurant's attention to detail was made evident from beginning to end.\n\nWe started off the night by grabbing cocktails at the restaurant's lounge which is right next door.  Shortly after, we were seated and greeted by our server who, in my opinion, was a HUGE contributing factor to having such a wonderful experience there.  After deliberating with my date as to what each of us would have that night, we decided that we would choose their 4-course tasting menu.  Keep in mind that in addition to the 4 courses that each of us chose, smaller dishes were delivered throughout the meal as compliments of the chef. \n\nSome of our favorite dishes of the night include: the caviar (accompanied by potato blinis with lobster and creme fraiche), the warm pig feet, sweet bread and lobster terrine, the seared fois gras, the lobster and mushroom risotto, topped with shaved black truffles (aka the star of the show), and the cheese souffle.  Also, because I had mentioned that it was a birthday dinner, they put a candle with a special \"Happy Birthday\" note on the dessert we ordered.  To top it all off, at the end of the night, the chef came out to personally greet his guests and make sure everything came out to their liking.  \n\nAfter finishing our meal, we got to enjoy the last of our chardonnay with yet another complimentary dish of petit fours.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-30", "description": "La Folie is a really good French restaurant in in the Russian Hill neighborhood. K and I went out with friends on Saturday night sans kids.\n\nLook and feel: Classy, understated. The main room has a bar and around a dozen tables. I was told there was another room, but I didn't see it. \n\nThe dining room had a bustling feel to it because of the constant flow of wait staff and the full tables. There was enough din for private conversations, but it wasn't so loud that we had any trouble hearing everyone at out table of four.\n\nValet parking is available out front ($15) which reduces the stress of finding a place to park in the neighborhood.\n\nMenu: La Folie has a really satisfying menu style of \"build your own\" prix fixe. You select 3, 4, or 5 courses from ~30 selections. Other than a limit of one main course, you are completely free to pick from any of the categories you like.\n\nThe food:\n\nI'm doing this from memory, because their online menu is almost 2 year out of date. (I'm allowed to expect that a fancy restaurant in the Silicon Valley's backyard can keep their online menu up to date, aren't I?)\n\nLobster and mushroom risotto - The texture was great, with nice chunks of lobster and rich flavor. It was a little too salty, but only mentionable because the salt level was inconsistent with several of the items we ordered. C also had this item, and she found hers pretty bland.\n\nHeirloom tomato and fig salad - K ordered this. It was visually stunning. She said it was good except for two cooked elements, a tomato gelatin and a tomato-vodka sorbet, both of which she found salty and odd.\n\nFoie gras soup - C ordered this. It looked and tasted like a fois gras cappuchino (minus the coffee.) Absolutely amazing.\n\nSeared foie gras with wild huckleberry sauce - This was possibly the best piece of foie gras I've ever had. It was also the biggest. Yet I had no problem whatsoever finishing it. Yum. A little salty, but I do like salt.\n\nGrilled Dorade with bacon jus - My first bite of this dish supplied an overly fishy flavor, which concerned me. The rest of the dish was sublime. Crispy skin, moist flesh, and the bacon jus was heavenly. \n\nSeared scallop - There wasn't anything special about this except a perfectly prepared sea scallop.\n\nBeef trio - This consisted of a filet, a short rib, and a mini-burger. The filet was stellar. The short rib fell apart on my fork. The burger, with a little foie gras, was merely okay. To be fair, by the time the beef dish was served I was nearly stuffed, so I'm not sure I gave the burger an honest chance.\n\nGoat cheese tatin - K wasn't impressed with this. It was okay, but not great. It needed more cheese.\n\nButter poached lobster - Lobster served in the shell over a tasty pea ravioli, looked like a Botticelli painting. \n\nRoti squab and quail - K's main dish, this was just fantastic. The game birds were extremely flavorful and juicy.\n\nEdam souffle - K and C ordered this dessert, which was a light and subtle cheese souffle. It made for an excellent ending to the meal.\n\nSnails with marrow crust - Beautiful presentation. My first ever taste of escargot, so I'm not in a position to judge it that well, but I found it flavorful, and it struck me as tasting like an earthy crustacean, which seems apt.\n\nTempura duck egg - This was a soft-boiled egg with a tempura shell. It was interesting to see. P and C both ordered this and found it okay. I didn't try it. \n\nMushroom risotto with white truffle - They had a special this night, $50 for 5 grams of white truffle over any dish. P chose to have it over the mushroom risotto. He loved the truffle, but he also found the risotto to be bland. Clearly there were mutliple chefs in the kitchen, at least one of them a little heavy on the salt, and another a little light.\n\n\nService: The service was outstanding. All of the servers were polite, prompt, and knowledgeable about the menu. Water glasses were kept full at all times. Our dishes were bussed at just the right time. The pacing of the courses was perfect. \n\nWhen we asked for the bill, the hostess prompted the valet for our car, so we had a very minimal wait before it arrived upon our exit.\n\nValue: It's a rather fancy restaurant in SF, so it's not cheap. This is a pleasant case of \"you get what you pay for.\" We dropped $760 (after tip) for the four of us. Was it worth it? I think so. I mean, we can't afford this all that often, but we don't get out for nice dinners without the kids with much frequency. I was much more impressed with this place than with Manresa (where we spent $400 for two.)\n\nIf I had one complaint from a value perspective, it's with the charge of $4.50 for a cup of coffee at the end. Seriously, is that necessary when the diners are having $95 prix fixe meals and drinking $70 of wine? It left me feeling nickel-and-dimed.\n\nWill I go back? I'm sure we'll have the opportunity to go back as this has become our friends' favorite restaurant in SF. I wouldn't pass up the chance.", "author": "Jason G."}

Excellent on all points: food, presentation, service, atmosphere, and cost. 4.75 stars. \n\nCost to worth it ratio: 4 (at $75 for 3 sizeable courses, this was steal) \n\nEve award: best filet, best savory dessert \n\nHighlights: \n- Atmosphere: small spot yet decorated tastefully with colored walls and curtains. Classy yet not stuffy. \n- Menu set up: unlike some fine dining spots with one set menu, you have many choices here. You can choose 3, 4 or 5 courses from the list on the right or choose the special tasting menu. Sometimes French food gets a bad wrap with people thinking they'll need a magnifying glass to see the minuscule portion on the plate, but these were all full sized, so even though I like variety and do have a big stomach, 3 was plenty. \n- Overall food: impressive artistic presentation, outside of the traditional French box, excellent ingredients and preparations. Here are the items I ate in order of preference, but I liked them all. Pics: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSixRz7xcwtFdeh9hN5TyQ?select=4_GRgJBLiuJQIcKSkdfE_Q\n-- Beef trio entr\u00e9e: of course the hub's choice but the plate had out if this world items. First off the filet was the best I've ever tasted and I'm one picky filet girl. Perfectly seared with amazing internal juices. Shortribs was omg oh so tender and naturally flavorful. There was a mini hamburger with a bit of foie inside, but I was too full to try it. \n-- Lobster: fantastic. Perfectly butter poached, huge meaty tail piece, delectable sauce anchored with a ravioli base. \n-- Cheese souffl\u00e9 dessert: magical combination of salty cheese, pieces of bacon, and delicate airy souflee with just the right amount of sweetness. Paired with a tart yet creamy ice cream with sweet crunchies, this is a winner. The perfect balance is on par with a tightrope walker who easily makes her way across to the other side--awe inspiring and not something the average person can accomplish. \n- Crab salad: elegantly presented in layers of crunch on top, dungenous crab and pineapple, and finished with a thick layer of coconut jello Hawaiian haupia style. Delicate, mellow on flavor, yet harmonious. \n- Duck: 6 sizeable slices cooked well and not over-seasoned. Pot of duck confit vegetables and bacon was insane with the intense smokey and bacony flavors. \n- Amuse: octopus and thin slices of abalone presented in the shell. I was surprised and happy to find a Japanese seaweed salad at the bottom of it all. \n- Special occasion recognition: they congratulated us upon seating and had our dessert read happy anniversary which was a nice touch. \n- Sommolier: helpful and not condescending thank goodness. Also didn't just point out the most expensive or cheapest wines like some do. \n- Service: good. Knowledgeable and friendly waiter and attentive bread, water, and plate clearing staff. \n\nLowlights: \n- Surcharges: the hub doesn't care for seafood yet if he ordered 2 meat courses he would have to pay $25 extra. I understand if he wanted 5 all meat but 1 extra in place of a seafood shouldn't be extra. \n- Truffle centric: from the amuse to courses thereafter the truffle was a point of interest. Truffles are cool and all, but I prefer to limit them to a few extra special dishes. \n\nAll around solid excellent fine dining meal. I highly recommend it and will be back.", "author": "Eve K."}

From start to finish, they were very attentive without being pretentious. Our reservation was at 8PM and we needed to be at another place by 10:30PM. We asked our waiter if we would be able to do that ordering the 5 course menu. He was very honest and told us that the 3 course would be a better choice for us. 3 course we did. \n\nAs soon as we were done with our first plate, the next one would come out very fast. Our waiter made sure this happened and we appreciated it!\n\nSo this is what I ordered:\n\nTo start with the chef presented us with a couple of compliments. I should have written this down right after our dinner, because I can't remember what they were now! Darn it. \n\nFor my appetizer,  I got the Dungeness Crab Salad, on Coconut Carrot Panna Cotta, Yellow Curry Tuile, Curried Crab Vinaigrette\n\nNext  was the Frog Legs \"Bernard Loiseau\", Garlic Puree and Parsley Coulis. This was good. I had frog legs growing up and Indos know how to cook up a mean frog leg dish with some hot sauce. The frog legs were deep fried and were tastefully done. I really didn't think they would be able to; the garlic puree was not overpowering at all. I enjoyed it. I even took some ofmy bf's frog legs. \n\nI ended it with Lobster and Mushroom Risotto, with Leeks and Lobster Broth. My favorite of the night! \n\nAfter we finished our entrees, I was surprised with an ice cream cake from my favorite ice cream shop, Ici, followed by more compliments of the chef that I again fail to remember. \n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful time. One note is this place is not suitable for a large group. It's very small and intimate. Any group conversation will carry throughout the room and ruin the intimate atmosphere.\nAlso, there is a dress code Perfect for a romantic night out with that special someone in your life ;)", "author": "Cindy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-03", "description": "La Folie manages to feel like a small restaurant by dividing the seating into different dining rooms. The rear room seems designed for private parties and trades the natural light of the street for a bit of seclusion.  The walls baffle sound rather than reflect it which gives the place a calmer feel than most restaurants in the City.  The decor continues that theme with white and black highlights, brown patterned uniforms for the waiters to match the light and dark wood, and simple black for the kitchen staff.\n\nThe uncluttered menu prices at $75, $85, or $95 for 3, 4, or 5 courses, plus $55 for matching wines. A selection of five courses has been prepared to the left.  Alternate selections have been arranged into five groups at the right.  The only pricing offsets are for Kobe beef(+60), Italian truffles(+10) and the cherry foie gras(+10).\n\nIn addition to the five courses, the Chef adds several palate cleansers between courses.  Last night there was a peanut butter reduction, a poached egg, a strawberry-based shot, and a tray of sweets.\n\nThe portions are generous and prepared so well that it would seem criminal to waste any of them.", "author": "Mel N."}

This restaurant officially just knocked out Gary Danko for My-Favorite-Restaurant-In-The-City-That-I-Can't-Afford-To-Eat-At-More-Than-Once-A-Year.\n\nService was fantastic, we were seated right away when we walked in. The ambiance is fairly romantic but not dark, the tables far enough apart so you don't feel like intruders, and the noise level low enough to where you don't have to strain to  hear your conversation. The sommelier was very friendly and knowledgeable, helping us pick out a nice bottle of champagne and then a bottle of riesling. \n\nStarted off with the Half Ounce of Russian Osetra Caviar, served on potato blinis with lobster and creme fraiche. What a way to start off dinner! The sauce was delicious, the caviar just explodes in your mouth, and the lobster pieces were a nice surprise. \n\n\"The Tasting of Passot Roe\" with scallop ceviche, yellowtail sashimi, and kusshi oyster was delicious as well, each a different flavor and yet complimentary at the same time. The lobster noodles after that didn't really hold up, but it was still a good dish.\n\nWe then had the amazing Lobster Risotto, and if you ever order this, get it with the truffles!! They even bring the truffles out for you to smell (I couldn't smell a thing, but gave a hopefully believable \"ahh\") \n\nThen, Kobe Wagyu trio was definitely the most tender beef I have ever had. It really just melts in your mouth, and the flavors were amazing.  \n\nLast, but certainly  not least, the desserts. We ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate fondant, and while the chocolate fondant was delicious, the bread pudding was out of this world (and I'm not even a huge fan of sweets). It managed to reduce my boyfriend to a little kid, giggling and smiling for the entire time that he was hogging the pudding. For the 3 bites I managed to get before he devoured it, I must say, it was truly amazing.", "author": "Christine H."}

I don't think I'm exaggerating either, hahaha.\n\nI had the 4 course dinner paired with a white and a red wine. I began with an appetizer, the sauteed burgundy snails in bone marrow, then the pan seared daurade and duck breast, and then for dessert the peach melba baked alaska to end my meal.\n\n I would say that the escargot and peach melba were the highlights of my meal. It's hard to describe in words, you really have to try it for yourself! The snails were perfectly cooked and whatever ingredients they used worked so well together. As a dessert fanatic, the peach melba was also a big hit, it was perfectly semisweet and made with a lot of thought. The duck breast, and duck tongue especially, was also very good. The fish was okay, I wish I got another meat though, like the butter poached lobster, which was reallly delicious! I was also able to try a bit of their foie gras, frog legs, and risotto. Their foie gras is really really good, same with the risotto, but the frog legs were were strange. Throughout our dinner, we were able to try their sample dishes, like their raw ahi tuna, egg amuse bouche, and a refreshing strawberry shooter. These sample dishes were also highlights of my evening, especially the egg amuse bouche. It was perfectly creamy and garlicy. \n\nAnyway, it wasn't just the food either. Our waitress, this bald old guy, was very warm and welcoming. We even had the chance to meet the chef and compliment his dishes. Overall, it was a great experience.

Chef is a rebel and if you so dared, you could put together a 5 course foie dinner including dessert.  Somehow one person in our group actually managed to do that from foie soup to dessert and everything in between, the portions were not skimpy nor was the flavor.  My personal favorite was probably the scallop with foie, though the rosemary spear was a bit overpowering and I later realized a couple of others at the table who ordered the same did not get the rosemary, odd to have that inconsistency here.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dessert so that we could all sample.  We enjoyed our really long dinner here and the staff was great, Chef even came out to say hello at the end of the evening.  We brought a bottle and bought a bottle so our corkage was waived.\n\nWould have given 5 stars but with all the supplemental pricing with the various courses the bill quickly became out of hand.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-22", "description": "Ok, maybe more 4 1/2 stars...but I usually don't rate a restaurant this high...so I really like it.  We came here last night for the boyfriend's birthday.  He loves french food, and we were excited to try this place.\n\nFirst off, the service was awesome.  I've been to similar styled restaurants and I don't think the service anywhere else is to par with this (the only better service have been at those suit and tie required places).  Anyhow, our waiter was nice, fun, and inviting.  Our water and bread plate was always filled, and in such a manner that it doesn't feel intrusive or invasive...it's just magic and you don't even notice because they do it so well.\n\nWe opted to go with the 3 course meal because I wasn't as hungry as I thought I would be...and I'm glad we did that because by the end of the night I could barely eat!  My 3 courses included: Frog Legs \"Bernard Loiseau\", R\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab, and \"The Sunset\" Warm Bittersweet Chocolate Fondant.  The boyfriend ordered the burgundy snails, the duck breast, and the peanut butter opera cake.\n\nOur meal started with a tiny amuse bouche of ahi tuna tartare and a crisp.  A nice little bite to start of the meal.  Next they served us yet another amuse bouche, although slightly more than just \"one bite.\"  It was a poached organic egg in an egg shell with some cream and a crispy potato and a brioche to dip.  This was one of my favorite things of the meal.  It was so good mixing up the egg yolk and dipping it with the brioche and bread.  I couldn't get enough of this and even contemplated snatching the boyfriend's egg to finish that up too.  After this, we were getting excited for our appetizers, when yet another little treat was sent out to us from the chef.  It was a smoked salmon and marscapone cheese lollipop.  It was visually beautifully...and tasted delicious.  I usually hate seafood, I'm not one to eat seafood, but so far the tuna tartare and this was delicious and ate it all.\n\nOur meal was just beginning.  Our appetizers came out.  The boyfriend's escargot was sauteed and then placed in a bone with marrow placed on top.  I'm usually not a fan of escargot either because of the chewy texture, but this was definitely the best I've had. My frog leg was delicious.  There was a parsley puree and a garlic puree that was there to dip and it was just delectable.  The frog legs came with a scallop mousse though...I wasn't a fan of that (see the dislike for seafood above) but the boyfriend is still talking about it today.\n\nNext were our entrees.  His duck was delicious, it was creative twist to the duck we've had in the past.  My roti of squab and quail was stuffed with mushrooms and then wrapped in crispy potato strings.  This was the best thing and may be one of my favorite dishes ever.  EVER.  It was so creative and tasty.  It looked like a beef wellington, but was so much more delicious and amazing!  Fantastic...I ate it so fast that I got full too quickly.  There was also a \"basket\" for fun of a poached quail egg, and I devoured that and wished for more.\n\nDessert was just as good.  My chocolate cake was delicious...although I found the brandied fruit a little to strong for my taste.  The peanut butter opera cake was fantastic too.  During dessert the chef came out to wish the boyfriend a happy birthday.  Such a nice treat and surprise.  It was great to meet him and he was really sweet to us.  It doesn't seem much, but it did leave an impression.\n\nAfter dessert, we found out that there was an additional \"treat\" that they were going to send out for us...some petit fours as another special bonus.  We were so full from our meal already, the waiter insisted on boxing it up so we could have for later.  We paid the bill and got our coats and left and forgot all about the petit four until our waiter came running up the hill we were walking to give us the box.  Now that's dedication and service!\n\nOverall, I'm thoroughly pleased, impressed, and looking forward to coming back here again.  I never got our waiter's name, but thank you sir for helping me treat the boyfriend to a fabulous 30th birthday.", "author": "Quynh-An P."}

We were too ambitious and should of went with the 3 course for each...four courses was WAAAY too much food. You can actually pick ANY items off the menu to fulfill your 3,4, or 5 course offfering, which is really cool. So I could of chosen 4 entree courses if I had wanted to.\n\nWe paid an extra $25 for several shavings of black truffles (you decide what dish you want it on) to go onto the risotto. I'd skip the truffles if I was you, not worth it for that price. We also got the La Beouf supplement which was an additional $20 but oh man it is definitely worth it!\n\n2006 Grand Cru Bordeaux - forgot what appellation the wine was from but it was amazing. Served by George Passot, sommelier and brother of Chef Roland Passot\n\nDungeness Crab Salad - crab was succulent and sweet, awesome presentation\n\n\"Tasting of Passot Roe\" - scallop ceviche, yellowtail, and Kusshi oysters. The yellowtail sashimi had to be the FRESHEST fish I've ever tasted...fresher than most sushi restaurants!\n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras Torchon - my least favorite dish of the night, it was still pretty damn good though. Didn't care for the cold foie gras. But the seared foie gras we had later was a different story\n\nSeared Day Boat Scallop and Foie Gras Rossini - probably my favorite dish of the night. It was a single perfectly seared scallop topped with seared foie gras. The combination of the two was heavenly...just rich, creamy, and delicious!\n\nLobster and Mushroom Risotto - it was good, can't remember too much else, I was starting to get full at this point...\n\nRoasted Emigh Farms Lamb Rack - One lamb rack with a long curvy bone, very nice touch to an elegant presentation. Also had lamb sausage which was good too.\n\n\"Le Beouf\" - the filet mignon, it was $20 extra added to the 4 course menu price but you had better get this if you know what's good for you. I work at a fine dining steakhouse in Boston and this is BY FAR THE BEST piece of steak I've ever had. She asked for it medium-rare, it came out more on the rare side but we didn't care because it was such a delicate piece of meat and it is to die for!!!\n\nWarm Edam Cheese Souffle Dessert - we were in an absolute food coma at this point. Cheese souffle was very nice, delicate, and tasty, topped with tiny bacon bits. \n\nAfter dessert I was sooo full. Four courses of food was waaay too much. Our server was Mandy, she was great, very well spoken, polite, and extremely professional. They cleared our plates, silverware in a timely fashion after each course and set up the next course promptly. We never had to refill our wine glasses ourselves. The service was pretty much perfect and I get hyper critical over service. The food was damn perfect as well. Overall, best meal I've had yet and I think I've dined at some tasty restaurants.

It takes so darn long between the courses, the waiters don't communicate with each other so things get mixed up, and they dont have great common sense.  \n\nFor example, we knew we would be full but my husband still felt like some caviar.  He asked to split it.  The same amount of caviar came on twice as much bilini and twice as much creme fraiche.  Really?  It was terrible, the caviar didn't get the chance to shine with all that creme. Also, the champagne came 20 min too late.  So they said sorry by giving us each extra pours of champagne.  That's great, but I wish they would have asked.  I have a limit of champagne before I start feeling sick.  \n\nWith the combination of having no self control to stay away from drinks or food spread in front of me and the incredibly HEAVY, RICH food they served every single course, I was feeling pretty sick.

The caramelization of the sugars were fantastic!\n\nWine: A combination of 2 white and 2 red wines really enhanced the flavor of each entree.

I typed a much longer review but ran into the 5000 character limit.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions about anything.\n\nMy bestfriend and I arrived at La Folie on a drizzling night and were greeted by an inattentive valet service (which I read about in other yelp reviews so no big surprise).  \n\nThe restaurant is gorgeous inside and is quite quaint.  Probably no more than 15 tables which explains the required credit card reservation on open table.  Service inside is much greater than the valets outside.\n\nOnce we were seated, our awesome waiter (who's name I can't remember) greeted us warmly and informed us about how to order.  You can order anything on the menu from any section and have it served at any time.  ie, desert first, or even 5 deserts if that's your thing.  Our waiter also took the time to cover over the caviar and truffle options.  The smell of the truffles was AMAZING, but alas, they were too expensive for my budget ($75 supplement per dish.)  O.O'  We had read that the portions were huge so we decided on 4 courses each.  \n\nCanape #1:  Steak tartare garnished with crispy pork skin\nA great classic.  Slightly heavy hand with the pepper but love the assertive onion or shallot flavor and the crispy thin pork skin was a nice touch.  A great first bite of the evening. \n\nCanape #2:  Triple T Ranch Egg Amuse Bouche\nAmazing dish.  The egg custard was sooooo buttery/creamy rich and I am so glad they brought us freshly baked mini baguettes before this dish.  One of my favorite dishes of the night.  I loved the presentation in the egg shell and I savored it to the last drop.\n\nCourse 1 (Appetizer A):  Warm Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine.\nThis was probably my favorite dish of the night.  an amazing pork dish that was crispy on the outside and beautifully tender of the inside. The dish is perfectly balanced with the garnishes in addition to the frisee salad on top.  And bacon, can't forget the bacon.  The lentils had the great taste of capers to me which I loved.  Also, the portion itself is huge!  Almost the size of a full size Filet!  A must try dish that I've never anywhere else and it was delicious.\n\nCourse 1 (Appetizer B):  Sear Hudson Valley Foie Gras\nMy friend and I dropped our jaws, and opened our eyes to the fullest.  It was the biggest piece of Foie Gras I had ever seen!  I'm talking 2-3 times bigger! Foie was perfect but I wasn't the biggest fan of the poach quince or the consomme. It had an aftertaste that kind of reminded me of cinnamon. I definitely prefer the foie at Gary Danko better.  I guess due to boredom, I try the foie with the garnish from my Pig Feet app and it was amazing!!  My friend and I flirted with the idea that next time, we would ask the chef to prepare the dish that way!  \n\nCourse 2 (Fish A):  Butter Poached Lobster.\nLobster was perfectly cooked and had a great texture.  The ravioli was beautifully seasoned and great flavor.  The truffle beurre fondue was a little off balance with the dish.  I would have preferred a vinagrette of some kind instead because the sauce slightly muddled the dish.  It needed a little acid, (even a squeeze of lemon), at least to me. I would order again.\n\nCourse 2 (Fish B):  Seared Dayboat Scallops.\nActually, it was just a single scallop but that was probably to the course size reduction of ordering 4 dishes instead of 3.  The scallop was well cooked and the caramelized cauliflower was the nice touch but the braised pork belly garnish was tough/overcooked which marred the dish a bit.  I love scallops, but I would recommend skipping this dish if you're looking to get your money's worth.\n\nCourse 3 (Meat):  Roti of Quail and Squab.\nThis course to me appeared to be somewhat like a game bird \"wellington.\"  Great texture but when I ate the quail and squab together in one bite, I couldn't tell them apart.  Both meats were cooked perfect.  The quail was midwell while the squab was midrare.  A good dish, but a little forgetable.\n\nCourse 3 (Meat):  Le Boeuf\nThe Filet was a overcooked but tender, the short rib was a little salty and the rossini burger was a little bland.  Not the best dish.\n\nCourse 4 (Dessert):  Pink Lady Apple Bread Pudding\nGood but nothing special.  I've had better bread pudding.\n\nCourse 4 (Dessert):  Creme Brulee Cake\nExactly what it sounds like.  Tasted great and the pistachio was a nice touch.  I would recommend.\n\n\nAll in all, some hits and misses. If I could do the meat course over, I would've ordered the Duck and Lamb instead.  They looked awesome at the table next to us.  Dessert is skippable in my opinion.  Great atmosphere, great portions, great experience.  Even with my complaints, it deserves the full 5 star rating (or at the very least, 4.5 stars)  If you go, do a 3 course with wine pairings and skip dessert or have coffee and dessert somewhere else.

Their website definitely does not do them any justice! \n\nNow for the review. \n\nFood: This is currently my favorite fine dining place to eat dinner in SF. My boyfriend and I love everything on the menu. They do an exceptional job with lobster. So if you are a lobster lover as we are this is the place for you. Also, try the mini burger, I guarantee it will be the best burger you ever taste! \n\nI know 5 courses can seem like a lot and it is! So be sure to pace yourself and save room for the dessert. The banana dessert is to die for. I already decided that I want it to be my birthday cake. :) It is well worth the splurge$ \n\nService: Every time that we have gone we have had different servers but they have all been great. They are all attentive, helpful, and funny. \n\nAmbiance: The front room is small but still manages to create intimacy. The back room has very high ceilings and feels almost den like. It is great for larger parties. The place overall is small for example the entrance is also the bar area. \n\nOverall: 5 Start Everything.

While La Folie is the calibre of restaurant I like to frequent, I unfortunately cannot rave about the food or service as other Yelpers. \n\nI'm a bit of a French Cuisine snob, so take my perceptions with a grain of salt; but overall, here have been my experiences:\n\nNot a tremendous amount of originality with the cuisine of late.   Sure - seared Day Boat Scallops with a reduction are great, but I've had them a million times.    Serve me something new that excites my palate.  \n\nI've had bad beef and duck here.    I can get by with the occasional overcooked Chateaubriand, but please, don't overcook my duck. \n\nI am a Foie Gras addict and effete snob when it comes to anything involving duck liver or pate or both.    La Folie's was mediocre at best. \n\nI always make reservations; yet consistently, I am to wait 15-20 mins before being seated.    This, in my opinion, is not acceptable if I have a reservation, irrespective of how busy a night it is.\n\nOn one occasional (a rather late seating), my server (a rather plucky young chap in good spirits) reeked of cigarette smoke to the point that I have to mention it.    Obviously embarrassed, he went away for a spell and came back...reeking of cologne.    Au revior palate and appetite...\n\nWhile I don't hate La Folie, it's just not at the top of my list anymore and moreover, I can't fathom giving them anywhere near 5 stars for what I experienced.", "author": "Max K."}

The goat cheese tatin on eggplant,  the rabbit served three ways, the terrine of sweetbreads and pigs feet were great. My favorite dish was my appetizer: a tempura whole egg on a sweetbreads blini. By the time I received my duck confit , I was too full to fully enjoy it. It was a little rare for me anyway but I think most people would appreciate it that way. The one dish I tried that was slightly disappointing was the lobster risotto. It was tasty and very creamy but the lobster flavor was too subtle, barely there really. Our server was wonderful. Actually, various servers brought our food in a timely fashion. \nI was very happy that they had Floc de Gascogne on the wine list. I have only found it at one other place in the city, Aquitaine. \nThe one thing that bugged me was that the server asked for our dessert order with our regular order. Of course, at the beginning of a dinner, I think I'll want a dessert later. At the end of that dinner, I could not have more than one tiny bite of my dessert. Same with everyone else at the table. It's a good m.o. for the restaurant.  I think I was slightly bullied.... in a nice way of course. Next time I will order my dessert at the end of my meal, even if I have to wait for it longer.

This was probably my favorite dish.  The lobster had a great smoky flavor.  The corn soup was also perfectly sweet.\n\nNext up, the Tataki of Ahi Tuna.  The tuna was really fresh and high quality.  I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato confit, and couldn't taste much of the parsley pistou.  I'm not a huge fan of salt at all but I think this dish could have used some salt.  I actually think the chef forgot to salt the dish, but I could be wrong.  \n\nThe butter poached lobster on pea filled ravioli followed.  This dish had a great presentation.  The anise made this dish pop!  The pea ravioli was very solid.  The ravioli was fresh and the pea flavor was very soft and clean.\n\nI finished with the Lamb Rack.  It was well flavored.  I got it medium rare, but I think it was a bit more rare than that.  Kind of expected though.  The fancier the restaurant the rarer the scale right?  I never had lamb tongue before but it was really good.  Reminds me of gumbo sausage.\n\nThe service was great.  They had a lot of other dishes on the house.  We had some poached egg dish that obviously took some time to prepare.  A melon shooter with raspberry in it to cleanse our palette after the main course was served to us.  \n\nAnd finally we got a small desert plate consisting of chocolate over hazeulnut, cannele de bordeaux (this was by far the most amazing), mini madelines with a brandied cherry inside and a fruit jelly.\n\nI tried the Edam Cheese Souffle, which was a bit more savory than I remember it being.  It was still great, but it could have been sweeter.  The cheese icecream was quite delicious, especially with the white sesame tulie.  \n\nOverall it was well worth the price (which wasn't that much).", "author": "Alexander H."}

The first, a 2002 Pouilly Fume from Domaine Cailbourdin, was absolutely delicious and a truly brilliant way to initiate such a remarkable meal.\r\n\r\nHe embarked on our epicurean journey with the Foie Gras Soup with Truffled Day Boat Scallop Ravioli while I had the Dungeness Crab Napoleon Layered with Crispy Pineapple Chips on Apple Gele. Next it was on to the Seared Day Boat Scallop on Braised Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Sweet Onion Pure for me and the Quail and Foie Gras Lollipops with Leek and Wild Mushroom Cannelloni for him. From there we sampled the Frog Legs \"Bernard Loiseau\" with a Pure of Garlic and Parsley Coulis before moving on to the Butter Poached Lobster and Glazed Oranges with Shiso, Scallion, Carrot and Toasted Almond Salad and the Rti of Quail and Squab stuffed with Mushrooms, Crispy Potato Strings, and Natural Jus with Truffles. By this point we were on the verge of food coma. And that's when they brought out dessert.\r\n\r\nThe thing I have always loved about La Folie is the exceptional service that never feels stifling or pretentious. I enjoyed choosing the wine with our sommelier and toward the end of the meal the chef came out to greet us.

(#1--private dinner at Chateau Rochegoude in Provence.)\n\nFood:  The least ambitious of us went with the 3-course.  The seared foie gras was perfectly prepared.  The richness of the foie was balanced with a delicious sauce with just the right amount of sweet and tart.  For my main, I went with the lobster risotto.  If it were socially acceptable, I would have licked that plate clean.  The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the risotto was hearty but not overly heavy.  For dessert, I had the molten chocolate cake.  I think angels flew by playing harps while I dove into it.\n\nService:  Attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine.  Our every question, even the littlest, were answered with great detail and enthusiasm.  Our server could not have been sweeter.  Everyone was wonderful and charming and clearly took pride in providing a top notch dining experience.\n\nDecor:  We sat in the rear dining area, which was a high contrast to the main dining room.  The back room has super high ceilings and covered walls--very reminiscent of a room you might find in a castle in France.  Even with the room full, the noise level was very low, and it was easy to have an intimate conversation.\n\nIt is a pricey experience, but it is worth it if you want to have a supreme dining experience.\n\nAnd side note:\nTo the couple sitting next to our table:  Shame, shame, shame on you for throwing a fit like a 5 year old because I was served my birthday dessert before you.  You were rude to the server, you were rude to us and you disrupted the dining experience of about 20 other people in that room.

And, uh, the punching.\n\nTheir interior is sharp (with ceiling-length wall mirrors, white tablecloths, and spotlight lighting) and their service even sharper. Our servers (Ben and others) were professional and not overbearing. Our table was always cleared, waters refilled, and they were patient with my obsessive picture-taking.\n\nWe were here on a weeknight, so it wasn't crowded. The rear dining room wasn't being used but we snuck a peek inside anyway - it's a different theme, but without the main lights on, it looked tired.\n\nLa Folie's food shines in terms of preparation, presentation, and flavor. Each dish is full of character. Initially, they seemed a little heavy-handed due to their intensity, but in concert it all worked:\n- We had several l'amuse bouches which did amuse.\n- The uni pana cota wasn't bad.\n- The in-shell truffled scrambled egg was presented in a clever plate and was smooth.\n- The risotto came with a truffle and Parmesan foam. The cheese flavor in the foam was noticeable over the truffles and the risotto was outstanding.\n- The duck and oxtail consomme was special, and easily my favorite part of the meal. It was elegant in its simplicity and soothing, not piping hot. The moist cuts of duck breast didn't hurt either. There's also a foie gras tortellini... I wish I had some right now!\n- The seared duck breast was tender and aromatic. The unusual \"cassoulet de Toulouse\" made me smile. It's a heavier course - if I had this before the consomme, that would have worked even better.\n\nRecommended for special occasions! Don't have one? Make one!", "author": "Dave L."}

It used to be a favorite place for us to celebrate, and we loved having Trey as our server.  However, we had the worse meal there on New Year's Eve that we've ever had in San Francisco.\n\nWe were seated in the early seating, and we decided to get the wine pairing with our meals.  Although we asked to be served by Trey, we wound up getting Mandy as our server.  We decided to get the golden Osetra supplement with the caviar course, and they accommodated my wife as she has a shellfish allergy (and did not get lobster with the course).  The first course was excellent.\n\nUnfortunately, the meal went downhill after the first course.  The second course (Hamachi and crispy Octopus salad) was not very memorable, and we both did not eat everything that was served.  I got the scallop for the 3rd course (which was ok); my wife got a different course, which was not memorable, and she sent it back.  We told our server (Mandy) that we did not like the course; she was very cold and distant, and did not even suggest something to make up for the course.  \n\nThe 4th course, which was the consomm\u00e9 of duck and oxtail was disgusting.  The broth was tasteless.  We did not finish this course, and told Mandy our concerns; again, she did not say anything to us, and just took the course away.\n\nMeanwhile, a party of 4 than sat down next to us, who were all lawyers.  They began talking very loudly about their clients by name; since my wife and I are both doctors, we knew the people they were talking about.  We asked them to not speak about their clients; initially, they asked us whether we were in their field, and when we told them we were not and that they were being inappropriate, they shouted several expletives at us and told us that we were the problem.  This party then moved to a different part of the restaurant.  \n\nWe then noticed that Mandy was gossiping in front of us to other staff, looking at us; my wife then called Mandy over and told her what she was doing was inappropriate.  Mandy acknowledged with no compunction that she was gossiping about us.  Unfortunately, this led to Mandy not coming back to our table for the rest of the meal.\n\nWe both got the tenderloin for the next course, and I got the foie gras supplement (yes, they have been offering this to customers the entire time, although now it will not be illegal).  The tenderloin was not cooked well; thank god I had the foie gras, as this was the only way I could eat it.  My wife ate very little of her tenderloin; our dogs did seem to enjoy it though later that night.\n\nThe dessert (the passion fruit opera cake) was very mediocre; my wife did not eat hers at all, and I ate mine out of hunger.\n\nWe then got our bill, which we discovered contained an 18% gratuity included.  We were both shocked that the restaurant did this automatically; there was nothing mentioned at the start of the meal that we would be charged 18%, and we were only a party of 2.  The service we got from Mandy was so terrible during this meal; we have never been treated this poorly during the previous 14 years dining there.  \n\nWe complained to the manager that we were not going to pay the 18% gratuity; he awkwardly agreed to this, but in the process of then trying to cancel the charge on our card and resubmit it, the bank declined our card as they though it was stolen.  I then had to get on the phone with the bank in the restaurant and review the charges; I was told by my bank that the restaurant could do something to have the charge go through.  However, the manager, seemed completely befuddled and then asked us for another card.  We told them that we were not going to pay for the meal with the 18% gratuity; we were very clear that we would pay our bill without the gratuity included.  The manager kept asking us for another card; we told them to get in contact with us at a later time, so that we can settle our bill.  I left my phone number for the owner (Chef Passot) to call me, knowing that the restaurant would be closed for 7 days.  We also emailed the restaurant that night, explaining the situation.\n\nWe never got called from the owner or the manager.  We wound up getting charged for the meal on the credit card they used for the reservation (without our knowledge), without the 18% gratuity.  We did receive some emails from the hostess (Elsa), but no explanation or apology about the meal, or about being charged for such a high gratuity.\n\nHad we gotten some acknowledgement from Mandy during the meal that there were problems with some of the courses, and were treated better, we would think about going back.  It seems like the restaurant does not care that we were regulars; I guess with all of the new found wealth in the city, they have enough people who will want to dine there.  However, I can't see how they will retain their Michelin star, as well as stay in business, if they treat their customers so poorly.", "author": "Andrew G."}

I had very high expectations of La Folie, since it had such high reviews and high price... Unfortunately, my experience at La Folie was mediocre at best. \nWhen I entered the restaurant, the decor is decent, but not what I would expect from a $100+ pp (not including drinks, tax, tip) restaurant. The waitress that served us did not give me a very friendly and welcomed feeling (don't get me wrong, she was not unfriendly or rude, just didn't seem like the kind of service I would expect from a restaurant that this price point.)\n\nWe selected a 4 course, and the Chef's tasting menu. \nI don't remember all the dishes (which tells you how [un]-memorable the experience was). A couple that I can recollect were:\nBurgundy Snails - My bf did not like it. He tried one and gave the rest of the plate to me. Can't blame anyone for that, he just isn't a snail person. But I do like snails in general, and this one had a really weird taste that just wasn't appealing to me. \nRanch Egg Amuse Bouche - I did like this dish. Very rich and the creme blended well with the egg yolk.\nDay Boat Scallop - The scallop had a very \"fishy\" taste... not the best I've had before, but edible.\nLamb chop - It was okay. The dish arrangement was very nice.\nQuail - This was probably my favorite dish. The mushrooms stuffed inside were actually my favorite part... The dish is way too oily though, and I was quite full at this point, so we weren't able to finish this dish.\nOverall I would say that the presentation of the dishes were good, but the taste... mostly failed. \n\nAnother note on the service, after our main server took our order, all our dishes were not delivered by her, but by these people that appeared to be bus boys - which is fine if only they had any ability to explain what the dish is in a reasonably professional manner. All of the people that delivered our dishes flew through the description like they were in a big hurry, and never made eye contact when explaining. Some of them smiled, some of them just stared at some other corner of the room. One of them was looking around the room as if he was looking for something or avoiding someone while murmuring to us what he had just put on our table. Again, not the kind of service I expected at this price point.\n\nSo, remember this was my boyfriend's birthday? When dessert was delivered, they did include a small candle and piece of chocolate that said \"Happy Birthday\" on it. Which was a thoughtful touch.\n \nOur final bill for 2 people turned out to be $3XX. Unfortunately the food and service I received does not justify the price. The overall quality felt a lot more like a $40 pp meal. I really wanted to like this restaurant and for this to me a super memorable experience - but was extremely disappointed.", "author": "Cynthia L."}

We had a great experience and will never forget the incredible food and service.", "author": "Danielle C."}

Since La Folie is located right on Polk Street, budget extra time for parking which can be difficult to find on Friday and Saturday nights.  Valet is pricey at $15.  There are two dining rooms - the front room is very dark and warm.  The back room (the Green room) is much brighter and didn't feel as cozy.  I was surprised how light it was in there, but it was due to the translucent ceilings which let in natural light.  Since we arrived at 6:30pm, it was still light outside.  The outer room is preferable if you want something more romantic.  I felt like it was hard to have a private conversation in the Green Room since it only seats half a dozen tables or so and you can hear everyone.\n\nThe service is fantastic.  They have a ton of waitstaff and the waiter we had was super friendly and nice.  Everyone does a great job of explaining all the dishes and you definitely feel well taken care of.  We decided to go all out and do the 5 course menu.  The prices on the website are outdated as is the menu.  3 courses is $75, 4 courses $85, and 5 courses $95.  But with the added amuse bouches and extra dishes, the 5 courses ended up being 9 courses.  I had been warned the portions are large for the type of restaurant and it ended up being true.  If you have a small appetite, save yourself some money and just get 3 or 4 courses.\n\nThe two amuse bouches that kicked off the meal were some sort of smoked mackerel and truffled egg yolk with mushroom.  The fish had some small bones in it that were edible, but I didn't like the way it felt in my throat.  The egg yolk with brioche was great.  \n\nFirst course - frog legs.  Frog legs taste like chicken to me.  It has the same taste and consistency.  The dish came with some strong pesto like sauce and also with two little cannelloni.  I thought it was good/different, but the pesto sauce was a bit too strong.\n\nSecond course - foie gras.  I had been especially warned about the exceptionally large portion of this dish.  There is a $10 supplement for the foie gras, but it's usually not tied to how large the portion is.  It was HUGE.  The biggest piece I have ever seen served in a restaurant.  However, I think it worked against them since foie gras is so rich and fatty that you kind of feel gross if you have too much of it in one sitting.  I also felt that the foie gras here wasn't that good and it was possibly the least tasty I have ever had in a restaurant.  That's not to say it wasn't good, but if you're going to serve it in a restaurant, it has to be pretty darn great.  It seemed a bit over done - it was hard along the edges and a bit stringy.  I didn't feel like I was savoring it since there was so much of it.  It took me quite a bit of time to get through it.\n\nThird course - lobster on top of an English Pea ravioli.  I liked this course a lot.  You get a huge chunk of lobster and the ravioli was delicious.  It was soft and mushy (the ravioli) in a good way and although I didn't really feel like the two went together, they each were great eaten on their own.\n\nMain course: I ordered the quail stuffed with mushroom encircled with potato strings.  There was also truffle juice and a quail egg in a little fried basket.  This dish had a lot going on.  I thought it was very creative and I think it was my favorite of the night.  The presentation was fabulous without being overdone and it was obvious a lot of handiwork went into it.  The quail was extremely tender and juicy.\n\nPalate cleanser: ginger mousse - very refreshing.\n\nDessert:  I ordered the cheese souffle.  I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it was good.  Not the best dessert ever, but it was good to try something new.  It tasted like warm egg with a hint of cheese.  It was served with a side of ice cream shaped like a torpedo like all fancy restaurants do.\n\nBonus dessert:  A plate of 4 bite sized confections including cherry Madelines, some sort of bite sized cake (don't know how to describe it), raspberry gelatin, and hazelnut fudge.  What a delicious way to end the meal!\n\nThe wine list isn't huge, but they do have a decent selection of half bottles which is handy because you're having so many different types of courses that it's hard to go with just one bottle.  We ended up having a half bottle each of red and white which was perfect.\n\nOverall, the service and value are a solid 5 stars.  You get an unbelievable amount of food for this type of restaurant.  I can't say enough good things about the waitstaff which was wonderful.  However, the taste of the food wasn't quite 5 star.  I would compare it, to say, a restaurant of Michael Mina or Fifth Floor caliber, but La Folie falls a tiny bit short.  Not by much, but there still is a difference.  Since it's not as hyped up as other places, reservations are relatively to get.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for an impressive meal, but lower key at the same time.", "author": "Karen K."}

La Folie ranks as one of my top favs in the city besides Gary Danko. There are a few other places I've yet to try and they're on my bucket list waiting for me to get to them eventually. \n\nWe've not been back since La Folie remodeled their dining room several years ago. The interior is beautiful. It's one of the few places in the city besides Coi which requires that you leave a credit card number on Open Table reservations. If you no show, there's a huge charge (like $50) per person on your credit card. \n\nWe had an early reservation, otherwise the next available was 9PM or after. Service was excellent and our server, Diane, was delightful and charming. There's a prix fixe menu with wonderful choices, but way too much food for me. Then, there are 3, 4 and 5 courses. Hubby and I had 3 courses and BFF & BFFH (hubby) had 4. When BFF was served her additional course, they'd bring hubby & I extra plates to sample their food. So thoughtful! \n\nRenowned for their foie gras, we could not resist (such villainy). BFF and hubby had the seared FG which I keep forgetting to order. It was so tender and lovely with peaches. BFFH & I tried the FG torchon which was a silken, buttery, melt in your mouth round medallion of pate'. Served with a tiny brioche and fig. BFF also had the foie gras soup, which was a creamy, savory soup with a hint of FG. \n\nWe were comp with several servings of amuse bouche: tuna tartare, a still liquefied egg course in shell with cream, a drink of berries, and tiny servings of 4 desserts at the end of our dessert meal - Madeline's, choc squares with a tiny gold foil, apricot jelly, etc. \nMy lobster was not overcooked with tender meat in the shell, served over a flat ravioli. The boys had rack of lamb with long rib extensions, meat cooked to perfection. I didn't try BFF's salmon but it looked great w/mushrooms. \n\nThe boys had the choc molten cake - choc oozing out when cut opened and heavenly. I had the cheese souffle, a tiny puffy souffle, very tasty with a tart spoonful of lemon sorbet on the side. \n\nThe bathroom is in the rear, one stall, unisex, right next to the kitchen. It was nicely decorated and clean, but was awkward as I was waiting with the guy in front of me right in the midst of all the traffic in and out of the kitchen and servers heating and plating the bread rolls. It was exciting to get a glimpse Chef Roland Passot hard at work with his team. The dude in front of me told me he used to be a chef and it's not uncommon for kitchens to be small to make more space for the dining room. \n\nThe fiscal damage is enormous when you dine at a place like this, Our bottle of Freemark cab alone was $76. But, the food was great. There were no less than 6 desserts which came out of the kitchen with a lit candle on it for birthday babies that evening.  Happy Birthday to hubby.", "author": "Ry T."}

Why is it outranked by the likes of Petite Deli, Ike's Place and Danilo Bakery in Yelp's Top Five for SF? Sometimes I don't understand this rating system.\n\nLa Folie is absolutely, positively a perfect culinary experience, and if they could expand their cramped dining room and give each table a little bit more room from the next table, it would be the perfect overall dining experience as well. \n\nI just returned from a four month whirlwind trip around the world where I ate foie gras and caviar tapas in Bilbao, grilled squid and fresh yogurt with honey in Greece, croissants aux amandes in the Cote d'Azur, seafood soup and oysters in Marseille, street tacos in Guatemala, alpaca and quinoa in Peru, currywurst in Berlin, kebabs in Istanbul, hummus and falafel in Jerusalem, masala chai and chaat in Mumbai, soondae in Seoul, and laksa and oyster omelets in Malaysia.  I didn't think anything could live up to the amazing culinary experiences I had abroad because frankly, in comparison, food in the US is kinda bland. \n\nOn my second day back stateside I took the bf to La Folie to celebrate his birthday - and it was tres magnifique!

The hostess sounded a bit snooty, but that could have possibly just been a result of her accent.\n\nFood: Most excellent and the portions rather large... not that I'm complaining. We both ordered the custom menu four course meal and both of us had some plates that we were unable to finish due to being completely full! The seared foie gras was phenomenal and massive, as others have pointed out. I was nervous as I hadn't had probably 99% of the items on the menu but it was all outstanding.\n\nService: Overall, very impressive. Our waiter knew the menu inside and out and was very attentive and friendly. The entire waitstaff kept the water and wine glasses constantly full and was as unobtrusive as possible, although we did have one approach to remove our plates before we were finished with the course. Not a big deal though and he was very apologetic. We'd just slowed down a bit because we were having trouble fitting any more food in! \n\nAmbience: The backroom we were in was rather charming and old fashioned. Other tables were in conversations and laughing which lightened the atmosphere and made it not feel so stuffy.  \n\nUpon leaving and grabbing our coats, the staff had a cab waiting outside before we stepped outside, impressive.\n\nWe spent a good three hours dining and had a lovely evening.

Hands down though, my favorite meal of the trip was at La Folie! The staff were incredibly conscientious and attentive, without being overly so, and the restaurant had an intimate feel without being too stuffy. The food was absolutely to-die for. I can't give you a single negative about the food. The seasoning was perfection, and everything was fresh and cooked just right. I didn't choose the chef's tasting menu, but I mixed and matched and created my own tasting menu, plus there were two amuse bouches, one palette cleanser, and extra peti fours to take home...I was so full, I could barely breathe, but I still wanted to eat. We had planned to go out after dinner, but I was so sated from all the amazing food, that we just ended back at our hotel in a daze of fine wine and food. The chef and owner of the restaurant came out to greet us, and he was the nicest man! So talented and down to earth. I wish I had taken a photo with him, as a keepsake.\n\nOne last note, we arrived early to our reservations, so we had a glass of wine at the La Folie lounge next door, and the Pinot Noir they have there is amazing.

If you are lucky, lady luck will shake a tree with enough force for a single juniper berry to fall in your lap.  Once you do, forever cherish it as I have mine.\n\nI made a reservation for La Folie for my girl's birthday.  If you have kept up with my reviews, you would have known she is a liver and onions type broad...one that requires very little wd-40.  While fine with eating sashami and burgers, once in a while, you have to upgrade the lube to something finer.  On the recommendation of my pops and because Gary Danko could not sit me,  la Folie had the honour of gracing our presence.  Making reservations at 6:00 pm, I almost nutted when I was able to score parking across the street.  I debated cabbing it or valeting it because I have read many horror tales of parking around this area.  In addition, I thought maybe this would be a night when wine (not franzia) would pour freely.  Walking in, we were immediately greeted and taken to our table and greeted by our waiter.  Usually at posh restaurants like this, (reference Chop steakhouse in Chicago), service can overbearing and borderline snobbish.  However, this place was not so.  Our waiter was very genuine, friendly and quickly became our friend even though I did not pay attention to his name.  He brought over a cocktail list and I ordered the pisco sour while apple of my eye ordered the blood and sand.  Both drinks arrived quickly and after both dipping our tongues in it, looked at each other like 0_0.  They were damn strong, especially hers.  It was basically an LC or liquid cocaine.  \n\nAs per the menu, I ordered the 5 course prix fix consisting of:\n1.  king salmon\n2.  rabbit prepared 3 ways\n3.  hudson seared fois gras\n4.  some cheese with honeycomb\n5.  tiramisu with blackberry sorbet\n\nMy girlfriend had the 4 course prix fix consisting of:\n1.  lobster risotto\n2.  duck breast with tongue\n3.  frog legs\n4.  molton lava cake\n\nThe first course was the fois gras and by george was it amazing.  I am not a fan of duck liver or liver at all for that matter, however, this tasted like butter.  It melted on the tongue.  In addition, they garnished it with a caramelized peach which was even better than the fois gras itself.  The rabbit was my first venture into this meat and it was delicious.  The rabbit  rolling spinach and carrots were delicious.  The mini rack of rabbit meat was adorable abet hard to eat.  My only complaint was the rabbit stuffed with mushroom.  There was a little too much mushrooms.  I ordered the salmon over the halibut on the strength of our serveur's recommendation and while the salmon was delicious with its corn puree, tasted like salmon I could get anywhere.  The cheese, substituted from the taste menu as I wanted the honeycomb, tasted good with the bread and blended perfectly with the honeycomb.  \n\nMy girlfriend loved her courses, however, I know deep down she knows I was wiser with my picks.  I tried a tidbit of her fixings and this is our coupled review.  Frog legs was a first for me and will probably be my last, however, it tasted like chicken.  They looked like mini drumsticks and were very good.  The duck breast was delicious.  It was epitome of perfect.  The meat was succulent and the skin was very crispy.  The tongue on the other hand left something to be desired.  According to my girlfriend, it reminded her of something she loves so very much and had to desist from eating too much.  The duck confit was also not to her liking.  I took a bite and it tasted good to me and I believe her belly just could not take any more meat.  This was also the first time I tried lobster and I couldn't really tell if I liked it or not.  The piece was too small.  The waiter kept on raving on and on about the risotto, however, it was alright to me.  Her molten lava cake, with Happy Birthday written in chocolate, was delicious but I prefer her molton lava cake mix.  Her only complaint was that the liquic cocaine doused candy pieces.\n\nThis place is very deserving of its 5 stars.  Their famous dish, the hudson fois gras is deserving of its recognition.  The service was impeccable.  While not overbearing, it was attentive and friendly.  We made talk with our waiter and cracked jokes with the attendants who took our dishes and silverware.  I actually looked forward to them coming to our table so I could trade grins with them.  One little anecdote of their service was when one of the waiters (not main one) brought out our dishes and explained them.  Upon giving my girlfriend her duck, she inquired as to what duck  confit meant.  He tried to explain, however, saw that she was not convinced.  Instead of spitting in her food, he went to the chef to ask and came back happily explaining it once more in layman terms.  He looked so happy when she understood that it reminded me of a young adolescent spying his first pair of tits at Corscia's nude beach.  5 STARS, 5 wifives and 5 wadDUUP", "author": "Brian V."}

After making the reservation 2 months in advance, we finally made it here last Saturday.\n\nParking in Russian Hill is tough but we found a parking across the street. When we first walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and she offered to take our jackets. Our waiter was Ben and he made us felt at home from beginning to end. He explained the menu and gave his recommendations. \n\nI had the 5 course meal with a glass on Pinot Noir and the wife had the 3 course meal.\n\nBefore we even start our meal, the chef provided a few complimentary  amuse bouches. First, a beef tartar which very flavorful. Both us us wish it was a full appetizer. Then came a duck egg in its own shell with the top off. The inside was a runny egg and mixed with a green sauce. This was also so tasty. For my first appetizer I ordered the seared foie gras with a poach pear. Hands down the best foie gras I ever had. My wife dislikes foie gras and ended up loving it. It's a huge slab and it wasn't greasy like I am use to, maybe because they drizzle broth over it. The foie gras and pear work together so well.  My wife's appetizer was the escargot in bone marrow. Not as good as the foie gras but very tasty as well. My next appetizer was the warm pigs feet, sweet bread, and lobster terrine. This was a very hardy dish. The waiter said this was consider comfort food in the country side. I didn't expect the dish to be covered around pigs skin. I ate the whole thing anyway. If you like pork belly, then you will love this dish. The wife's second appetizer was a tasting of passot roe which consist of abalone, tuna, and oyster. If you like fresh sushi, you will love this dish as well. At this time, I felt like I had a lot of food since the appetizers were good portions. My third dish was the lobster risotto and it was really buttery. The wife seem to really enjoy it. My main dish was the lamp chops cooked to a perfect medium rare. I didn't care too much for the beans and chorizo bits that came with it. The wife's main course was duck done three way. The duck breast was cooked at most medium and was super tender. The duck tongue is soft and yummy. The duck confit was delicious, nice crispy edges and tender in the inside. For desert, the chef brought out 4 little pastries each. One was a crispy chocolate ganache, a madaleine, a fruit jelly, and I cant recall the last one. The desert we order was cheese souffle with bacon and sorbet. This one was ok.\n\nAt the end of the night, our waiter even offered to call a cab for us but we didn't need one.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I would give it 6 stars if possible.", "author": "Kien M."}

The one thing I really appreciate about this place is the consistency of quality in their food. Most restaurants have one or two items that will blow you away and the rest will be so-so. While nothing blew me away, every single dish we ordered was very delicious and nothing disappointed at all. Also, I love that you have your choice of 3, 4, or 5 course meals and you can mix and match the dishes however you like. Portions are pretty generous in size, presentation was beautiful, service was friendly and all the amuse bouche dishes were complimentary.\n\nAmuse bouche: foie gras with apricot sauce - Delicious with or without the apricot sauce.\nAmuse bouche #2: Duck egg with toasted brioche - Was hesitant at first to eat the raw duck egg but it was delicious and very rich. The toasted brioche's crunchy texture complemented it nicely\nFoie Gras- You can never go wrong with the foie gras. Portion was generous in size and was delicious. Personally though, I like foie gras in the pure form. Although it came with a bunch of stuff next to it (I don't know all the fancy names to everything), I personally just like the pure taste of it itself. You don't have to dress up it up and it'll still taste delicious\nFrog Legs with puree - No idea what the puree is but it was delicious. It also has a custard-like thing in the middle of the dish which had a subtle flavor but I also enjoyed it. The frog legs themselves were good but it tasted like chicken to me.\nButter Poached Lobster- yummy in my tummy. Like foie gras, lobster is one of those things you can't really screw up either. It was a generous portion that sat on top of two pieces of ravioli. Delish\nDuck - WOW. This was probably the best entree. Duck was cooked medium rare and was so tender and juicy, you just need to try it to believe it.\nCheese souffle- Small little cup of the cheese souffle with a side of lemon (?) sorbet. Complements each other nicely and the cheese souffle was delicious. Good thing it was a small serving because I think it would have been too heavy if it was any bigger\nChocolate Passion Fruit Bombe - Rich chocolate ball with passion fruit filling. Sorbet on the side was good as well. I think I'm a bigger fan of lighter desserts than I am of the heavy ones. But good nonetheless\nChocolate Bread Pudding - This came out as an accident since they mixed it up (yay for free dessert) but they decorated it beautifully with a happy birthday sign and a candle. Bread pudding is yummy, that's all I need to say\nAmuse bouche: small treats including rice cake, madeleines, etc. Nice finish to a delicious meal.\n\nDelicious and a winner. Good job La Folie.", "author": "Diana Y."}

Also, you can make only one meat main course selection, and it is never mentioned anywhere in menu.\n\nParking is challenging even on Monday.\n \nOther than that La Folie is as good restaurant as it gets. Food is on the same level as Marinus or Dining Room at The Ritz-Carlton (except Foie Gras was the best I ever tried), slightly better or on the same level as in Gary Danko, clearly better then Michael Mina.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-13", "description": "It's good food with good service, but for $130 I expect something more.\n\nI get that San Francisco is an expensive city and that a four+ course meal in darkened surroundings with an army of waiting staff - including visits from the bartender, sommelier and chef - is going to cost a lot. The service was good, and barring a strange moment where my waiter questioned my decision to order two drinks I can't fault it. But this is a restaurant, and my score has to be mostly influenced by the food.\n\nThe meal started with a pair of amuse-bouches; the first was forgettable but tasty, and the second more memorable for the wrong reasons. It was a silver painted soft-boiled egg. The waiter explained that it had been mixed with something, but to my mouth I'd been given a piece of toasted bread and some warm egg yolk.\n\nI started with the crab with \"English\" pea panna cotta; there's evidently nothing English about panna cotta, and while the execution was fine - the panna cotta was well made - I just couldn't make myself like it.\n\nThat was followed by a tempura duck egg served on something forgettable. It was pleasant but not challenging - a tempura egg is exactly what it sounds like.\n\nI then paid the $20 supplement for the trio of beef; a steak (well cooked), short rib (well cooked), and a painfully bland kobe slider. Unfortunately, while the beef was well cooked and flavorful, it was served in a sauce that absolutely overpowered the flavor.\n\nI finished with a huckleberry Baked Alaska. Again, the execution was good but I was disappointed that the dessert wasn't sweeter; a quality I normally associate with a Baked Alaska.\n\nPetits fours were served after dessert and were one of the better points of the meal. Nothing to write home about, but even while looking for flaws I failed to find anything.\n\nThe drinks were similarly mixed (pun intended). I ordered two cocktails, one which was very good, one which was not only to my taste, but began separating through the course of the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere, service and choice on the menu were all great, but the meal was let down by some of the flavors and textures which is a shame. La Folie is a restaurant very close to being an excellent choice for a special occasion, but in San Francisco you'd be better saving some money and going to a cheaper restaurant for food of equal or better quality.", "author": "Rob C."}

After spending over $400 on a meal I will never go back to the place, and will not recommend it anyone. Here is why.\n\nWe decided on a 4-course meal. We started with a pair of foie gras's - hot and cold. The cold foie gras was delicious but the many other things on the plate made the dish look good but were unnecessary, so the plate was over done. The hot foie gras was served on a seared peach. The peach over-powered the delicate flavor of hot foie gras so that you could not taste the actual foie gras.\n\nFor the second course we had lobster with some greens, and some sort of a ravioli. Ravioli looked like a flat gelatinous form under the lobster and greens. I first thought it was sauce that became hard because it was sitting in the cold to long. Nothing special. The second lobster dish was a lobster risotto, which was underdone to the point that we had to return it. The second dish was better but still underdone.\n\nThird course dishes where quail, and rabbit. In general both types of meat have a delicate and distinct flavor, but the chef killed the flavors with tons of salt. I am not even going to go further with my descriptions, other than state that I like salt but it was too much even for me.\n\nDesert was nice.\n\nSo in the end I think La Folie is not as good as people say it is.

Giving this restaurant three stars is a bit harsh, but I do expect A LOT out of a restaurant at these prices.  The bar has been set high by Gary Danko.\n\nWe went here last weekend and had the five course prix fixe menu ($95/person at the time of this writing).  The menu itself is extensive and flexible like Gary Danko, though it is heavy on seafood and game.  The service was impeccable, and our female waitperson was just great. The food is very rich, and we actually had to take home our entrees because it really adds up.  The portion size is generous for this type of restaurant.  Actually, my favorite part of the meal was the corn soup with lobster bits and sweetbreads.\n\nSo why only three stars?  Actually I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but so many give it five stars here.  First off, the main entree choices were strictly game, with one offering of lamb rack.  If you wanted to get beef of any kind, it was a $20 (more for the kobe beef) upcharge ON TOP of the prix fixe prices.  I've never seen anything like that.  So I had the lamb and my wife had the squab and liver main.  I had also had the sashimi, scallop and roe dish, which was actually better than my main course.  We are not dessert people, but the chocolate and peanut butter cake with curry ice cream was decadently delicious.  \n\nDon't get me wrong: La Folie is a good place, and overall we had a better meal here than we did at the comparably priced Acquerello down the street.

I went with the 4 course, her, the 3 and while we selected a good assortment, we left it to fate to determine what would seriously be our downfall (but in a good way). \n\n(Consideration for the Foie Gras Menu pre 7/1/12)\nThe amuse bouche.....(it's equiv to another course when you round it up, so take that into consideration).  Therefore, if you were thinking you can take down 4 courses, go with 3.  If you were thinking of going for the full 5, go with 4.  Also, as a warning, if you plan on getting 2 dishes that contain foie gras, take that as another -1 dish because that foie gras is rich as hell and will keep you from enjoying the other things.  But yes, if you enjoy foie gras, and know of the imminent doom, then by all means, go for it.  \n\nHere's what we had:\n\nAmuse Bouches\n-Smoked Salmon with goat cheese filling and pickled veggies - good but not great.  Probably least favorite of the bouches.  \n-Duck and foie gras mouse - simple, light and great (see...they give you foie gras anyways!)\n-Mint pudding to cleanse the palate - always refreshing\n-Organic egg with creme fraiche - delicious and the runny yolk is to dieee for\n\nAppetizers\n-Frog legs - why did i doubt this, the garlic crust and the scallopped flan was spectacular.\n-Foie Gras Soup - rich full flavor...keyword, full.  this is so damn rich, its a good thing it comes in just a small cup with it being frothed up.  Plus it comes with a small side of seared foie gras (making you regret ordering that extra seared foie gras) but heck, its great.\n-Seared Foie Gras - yes i did it....for that $10 more it just made so much sense and although I hate to say it, but I am a failure.  I couldn't finish it and had to bring some home....although i don't regret it one bit\n-Warm Pig Feet, Sweet Bread, Lobster Terrine - huge, with the mustard dressing on the frizz and the smoked meaty goodness.  This was definitely too heavy for me to sustain and had to send half of it beaten to death and with the sweet bread and lobster picked out.  The smoked pig feet was probably ok, but I just wish I hadn't spoiled most of my dinner with the foie gras dishes so early.  DOh!\n\nEntrees (yes....now the entrees....get my drift?)\n-Day Scallops with truffle (+$20) and Foie gras......yes the foie gras yet AGAIN...but how dare you not enjoy this so freshly massive scallop\n-Rabbit Trio - wasko wabbits never tasted so finger lickin good.  Had the rabbit ribs (tender meat) a tourine of rabbit and innards, the rabbit liver also very flavorful, and a leg of rabbit.....so tender and juicy\n\nDessert\n-Bread Pudding with Granache and Green Tea fill with fresh Strawberries and ice cream.....yes that was it....or was it\n- 4 pieces of desserts for that last hint of sweetness before you leave the table crying in pain.  But heck, those small bites were all very tasty.  The lichee gelly of course was a nice citrusy touch and the granache chocalate cube was rich and smooth.

I got the 3 course meal and I chose the pigs feet terraine, Wagyu beef, and the baked Alaska. First of the terraine was so awesomely porky and fatty! If you like pork shoulder or pork for that matter, than you need to order this! The Wagyu beef was the most melt in your mouth and tender piece of beef I have ever tasted. The bone marrow custard and the sauce which was put into a fried piece of dough was so innovative and creamy! I have never tasted any type of beef that had so much flavor and so moist. The baked Alaska was no slouch either! The outside was toasted and charred to perfection with the inside oozing with a tart sherbet that balanced out the sweet of the outside. If I could eat here all day everyday I would, but than I would be living in the streets! LOL If you have the money to come here I would def do it ASAP!", "author": "Brandon C."}

It was nice and open and didn't feel stuffy.\n \nIt was good but didn't blow me away.  I think the flavors they used were not to my palette's liking so it's not to say that someone else would not appreciate the food more than me.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes.  A few of the dishes I tasted were too salty.\n \nThey had a Wagyu steak on the menu which you paid $60 additional for which the fiancee tried and would prob not order again.  The crab salad I ordered was fresh, but lacking flavor.  I shouldn't have ordered the sashimi-like appetizer.  The risotto was fine, but think such a restaurant doesn't need to use so much butter in it to make it taste good.  The fiancee ordered snails and that was good.  Think he liked his scallop.  The bread was good.  The dessert was not good at all especially for a restaurant of such caliber.  None of the pastry items were moist.", "author": "Teresa W."}

The ambiance was nice and fancy yet comfortable, the menu was interesting and delicious, everything came out perfectly. It was extremely rich though, partially my doing by ordering my selection. The highlights: le boef, the lobster risotto, and the crab soup.\n\nTip: If you are dining with someone else who also wants to try the le boef, be kind and share. It ended up being WAY too much food and I had to take it home, it was much better to eat the first night.\n\nPros:\n- friendly staff \n- great food\n- nice ambiance\n\nCons:\n- both desserts did not knock our socks off\n- everything is a supplement, the boef, wagyu, truffles, etc and I truly believe that if you are paying that much for dinner either raise the overall price and put the best food on the plate (ex wagyu instead of prime filet mignon) or don't offer everything for an upcharge.

I had the foie gras for an appetizer, then I ordered the lobster for my second course, but they threw in the atlantic cod for my second course, as I was skipping it for my last course (dessert).   So they turned it into four courses for me.  \n\nThe foie gras was huge!  It was juicy and just the way foie gras should be--fatty.  \n\nThe atlantic cod was savory and flaky.  (This was the additional course they added for me.)\n\nThe lobster was tender and slightly sweet.  It was delicious with the sauces on my plate.  They sold me on the truffles, so I had some on my lobster.  God, they were to die for.\n\nThen there was dessert--which was quite pan-asian (surprisingly).  It consisted of a mango/coconut pudding, sago and passionfruit sorbet, and chocolate-banana 'canoe'.  \n\nIn between the courses were palate cleansers (amuse bouche)...my favorite had to be the parmesan foam with risotto.  I could have housed a bucket of that stuff.  \n\nPersonally, I rather not have the amuse bouche...it took some taste bud attention away from my three courses.  \n\nThe staff was attentive, very attentive--with new place settings, change of bread with bread plate, refilling drinks, great presentation about the food, and completely unrushed.  \n\nDecor was nice, elegant and comfortable.  A nice touch was the spotlight for each and every table!  I hate it when it's too dark, and you can barely see anything on the plate, and have to wonder about the quality of the food in the dim lighting.\n\nParking was typical, have to loop around.  We got lucky and found a close very, very close.  They do have coatcheck and valet services.  \n\nHonestly, folks, come here for only very special occasions--otherwise you'll really have to break the piggy banks for it.   So, yes, prices = lots of dough.  I was treated, but still...\n\nAnd if you want reviews from my fellow diners on this evening...you'll have to read what they had--it was delicious as well.   \n\nDress code:  Please be dressy and classy.

In fact, my husband almost did not want to go. Although it was a special occasion, he felt the restaurant may be too formal and the food not good enough to merit the price.  He was wrong, obviously, on all accounts. \n\nThe whole experience was amazing. The service was outstanding and in my option was just as stellar as the food. You felt that you were really taken care of; there was a bit of formality, but everyone was extremely friendly and warm.  My husband is allergic to wheat and sometimes it can be awkward when ordering, but it was handled with such ease.  I just can't rave enough about our server that really understood the food with what we were drinking (which was not wine).  He paired all of our food to cocktails, drinks and port. Not easy.  \n\nThe food was all very unusual, the portions were very healthy and the food was amazing. You did not leave that place hungry, in fact I felt uncomfortably fully, like Thanksgiving. Some of our favorites were the beet salad, steak dinner or \"meat plate\", and foie gras torchon. The only area that was a bit weak was dessert. I love anything that has chocolate and felt the chocolate cake was very good, but nothing that stood out.  \n\nEverything was worth the price, but in the end we ended up paying $375 for each a four course meal and modest drinking.

Definitely a good option for vegetarian fine dining in San Francisco, especially if you've already been to Millennium a bunch of times. I only wish they had *more* vegetarian options -- but if you eat meat, you have plenty to choose from, of course.\n\nThe food was excellent: flavorful, thoughtful, well-prepared and beautiful. Notably, the portions were well-sized; we left feeling full but not over-stuffed. Since my boyfriend and I are both lacto-ovo vegetarian, we both got the vegetarian tasting menu (\"menu jardiniere\"), which was very good. The vegetarian amuse bouche was like, a small cube of compressed apple with jam, or something, and it was not very bouche-amusing, but whatevs. My favorite dish was a very interesting egg poached in an asparagus soup (I think) that was served in an egg shell -- not like anything I've had before, and so delicious. The beet salad was gorgeous and tasty, and the risotto was great. The only weak spot in the menu was the dessert course -- there were only a couple options that looked appealing, and I was not very impressed with the early spring strawberries dish that I got. On the other hand, my boyfriend got the Kabocha creme caramel cake with Maker's Mark ice cream and apple croustade, and that was quite good.\n\nCocktails were solid but not too remarkable. \n\nThe service was impeccable and friendly (except for one small hiccup which was quickly and graciously corrected, when a non-vegetarian amuse bouche came out to us by mistake).

A light flan was in the center.\n\nSauteed Burgundy Snails in Pernod Lemon Butter, parsley, bone Marrow gratin had good sized snails hidden inside a veal bone. You dig through the green crust in your quest for these little guys.\n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Carmelized Peaches and a Spiced Peach Consumme ($10.00 supplement) was simply excellent. A huge piece of perfectly cooked foie on top of the tasty peach. The consumme was stellar, possessing strong peach flavors, making it a perfect accent to the rich foie gras. Bread was still necessary to maximize utility.\n\n\nButter Poached Lobster on English Pea ravioli with Truffled Beurre Fondue, pea puree, and Marcona Almond Salad - another beautiful dish with a poached small lobster tail sandwiched into the greens. Definitely not as good as French laundry's, but good enough in San Francisco.\n\n\nPan Roasted Alaskan Halibut with Minute ratatouille, Jus de Boullabaisse, Summer vegetables was the only clinker of the night.

Slowly Braised Leg stuffed with wild mushrooms) with Spring Vegetables and Natural Jus was a stellar, beautiful, and pretty meaty entr\u00e9e.

We had to bring some of his home and found it even better next day, as the potato became crispier.\n\nRoasted Emigh Farms Lamb Rack with black olive sauce, Flageolet Beans and Chorizo, Taggiasca Olive Lamb Jus, Eggplant puree had two good sized tender lamb ribs cooked to a perfect medium rare. No gaminess, meaty legumes, and a weird savory sauce underneath the blueberries.\n\n\nPalatte Cleaner - Melon Soda with pearls was refreshing and helped wash away savory flavors.\n\nValhrona Bittersweet Chocolate and Double Passion Fruit Bombe with chocolate and passion fruit mousee and a dark chocolate ganache coating, Chocolate Nougatine Tulie and Coconut Sorbet was a good sized dessert with a strong tropical element that contrasted against the dark chocolate.\n\nWarm Edam Cheese Souffle with Fromage Blanc Sorbet, powered sugar and Crispy Bacon on top, White Sesame Tuile was a tiny savory/sweet souffl\u00e9 with a little bit of cheese flavor and some slightly 'cheesy' sorbet.\n\nValhrona Chocolate Bread Pudding with Champagne Sabayon on top, Strawberry Ice Cream was a very good dessert that featured warm and runny chocolate oozing from the bread pudding.\n\nPetit Fours - Chocolate plantain, Canele de bourdeaux, Madeleines with brandied cherries, Apricot Pate de Fruit.

I put together an ala carte menu while my fianc\u00e9 had the chef's menu. He actually decided he did not like one of the early dishes and did not eat it. The waiter asked him what was wrong and he explained he thought it was dry and didn't like it much (he put it in a nicer way than I'm saying now...). The waiter came back and said he had talked to the chef, the chef had tried it and agreed with him, and would be making him another course to compensate (and that one was delicious!) We certainly didn't need or expect that, but it was a very nice gesture and it really saved the experience for my fianc\u00e9 from being so-so.

We arrived about 10 minutes early hoping that maybe there will be a table waiting. No they said, your table will be ready at 9:30-9:35, but meanwhile go have a drink at the lounge next door (separate review for them to follow). So we did. At around 9:45, an older couple arrived at the lounge, They were also waiting for their reservation. At 10, we are still not seated! My husband went to check on the reservation. Another couple of minutes, they said.\n\n10:05 The tall blond woman with the high arched brows (the hostess) comes in and announces that our table is being set up right now. She always tells something to the older couple.\n\n10:10 Same woman comes in, and takes the older couple with her! (She gave them OUR table!)\n\n10:30 She comes in again, telling us that our table is being set up. My husband tells her that you told us this half an hour ago! Instead of apologizing, the hostess raised her nose, roller her eyes, and walked away! (I know you're reading this. Who do you think you are? The Queen of England? You're just a hostess at a French restaurant.....)\n\nAt around 10:45 or maybe even later, another lady came and got us and we were finally seated! We were told that another couple just wouldn't leave, that's why we had to wait so long for our table. For almost 1.5 hours another couple wouldn't leave? What about the fact that you gave away our table? To an older couple?\n\nI feel sorry for the chef at this restaurant. Doesn't he realize who he has working for him? And what is going on behind the scenes? He seemed like a very nice guy, and the food is good too, but there are other restaurants in the city that have good food and much better treatment of people.Gary Danko, for example, has the best service  and food in the city.

We got to the restaurant about 30 minutes early. The lady at the front told us we could go to their lounge next door and have a drink while we waited and that she would come get us when our table was ready. I loved their rose sparkling wine...so yum!\n\nThe lounge is a nice little spot, dimly lit, romantic. As promised, the lady came to get us when it was about time for our reservation. To get from lounge to dining room you have to walk out the door, outside, to next door (there is no interior access from lounge to dining room). Not a bad thing, just an interesting thing to note. \n\nAs it was Valentine's Day, the restaurant was extremely packed. I'm not sure what it is like on an average night. They served their pre-fixe V-Day menu. We decided to pay the extra $60 and do the menu with wine pairings. Our waiter was very nice and explained that the chef would be able to accomodate my gluten allergy. Nice. \n\nWe decided to splurge and spend the extra money and had the caviar. The presentation was amazing! Because I could not have the potato blinis on which the caviar is served, the chef ingeniously used a lobster claw, creme fraiche and some asparagus and created a caviar dish that was TO DIE FOR! I tried not to leave a single bit! (Caviar ain't cheap you know...but it was just so delicious, I couldn't stand to leave any on my plate!)\n\nFirst course was teh Kushi Oyster. There was an apple-champagne gelee which was an interesting contrast to the oyster.\n\nNext was a creamy and rich parsnip soup. With SWEETBREADS and truffle beignets....oooh, yumm.... I loved it! Very rich...\n\nI had the terrine of Salmon which was not what i expected. It was a cold dish with salmon, scallops, lobster and artichoke in a roulade of sorts. Not exactly what I expected and I really had thought it would be a warm dish. Least favorite of the night....\n\nMy hubby, on the other hand, had the lobster and mushroom risotto which was TO DIE FOR! If this is on the regular menu, I'm coming back for it. Small portion but it was a tasting menu so to be expected.\n\nFor our next course, I had the beef trio and he had the wagyu beef (for a premium). Very tender meats, a little oversalted however (and I have been known to pour it on). I had sorbets for dessert and my husband doesn't remember what he had....it was a good night.\n\nI would LOVE to splurge (it was a very pricey night!!!) and OVERINDULGE (the food is decadent!) on another night, perhaps on a non-holiday, when we can try their standard menu.  \n\nHighly recommend! Come for a special occasion, get all dressy, have a drink at their lounge, and have an amazing dinner in their restaurant.\n\nOh, one minus...we asked that our beef trio be boxed up since it was a lot of food and the meat was so delicous but when we left, they couldn't find it. Bummer!  Another slight disappointment:  for one or two courses there was also a slight delay with the service of the wine pairings and the corresponding dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-03", "description": "Summary: An amazing restaurant with amazing service. As our 1st Michellin star restaurant, we were not disappointed. High dishes of the night were the Frog legs, seared bay scallop, roti of quail and squab and the cheese souffle.\n\nLa Folie was my boyfriend and I's first Michelin star rated restaurant. We were not disappointed. I made a reservation 3 days beforehand for an 8 PM dinner on a Tuesday. I would imagine you would need to reserve earlier when dining on Fridays and weekends.\n\nVery, very good service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the dishes and cracked a few jokes in between. We were presented with three amuse-bouches throughout the night, which were described as gifts from the chef. Finally, Chef Roland Passot even came out and asked us how our dinner service went and thanked us for dining in his restaurant! He made us feel very special. \n\nWe both ordered 5-course meals which we could design ourselves. We ordered very different things so we had 10 unique dishes all in all.\n\nAmuse-Bouches: We were presented with egg yolk and chive soup served in a eggshell with a piece of brioche bread, foie gras mousse and a palate cleanser before dessert. Everything was excellent. My boyfriend loves eggs so he was very excited about the soup. The foie gras mouse was very light, but savory. The palate cleanser of with ginger crystals, creme fraiche was refreshing. \n\n1st course: Dungeness Crab Salad with a cauliflower panna cotta for him and a duck egg salad with a cube of bacon for me. Both very, very delicious. The bacon was simply amazing. So distant from the strips of bacon you see everywhere else.\n\n2nd course: Frog legs for him and lobster and mushroom risotto. His favorite dish of the night. First time I had tried frog legs knowingly. I was so soft. Similar to chicken, but more tender and delicate. Really good. The risotto was great. Not to memorable however. I liked that the portion for this heavy dish was quite small.\n\n3rd course: Butter poached lobster for him and seared scallop for me. The lobster was fresh and the scallop was absolutely perfectly cook. It was very tender and not gummy at all.\n\n4th course: Trio of rabbit for him and roti of quail and squab for me. The trio of rabbit was the low dish of the night. Still tasty with the jus, but it was a little tough and dry. The roti of quail and squab was delicious. It was a dish where the quail is stuffed in a squab with mushrooms, wrapped in potato strings and drizzled with au jus. Just stunning.\n\nBy this time we were dying. We were so, so, SO stuffed.\n\nDessert: He had the Baked Alaska which came out in the shape of a pinecone and I had edam cheese souffle with bacon bits and white cheese sorbet. The baked alaska was HUGE and he couldn't finish. The ice cream filling was very tasty. The souffle was WAY better. It has the perfect balance of sweet with a hint of savory. The sorbet was equally tantalizing. \n\nWe ended the meal with yet another gift of petit fours for each of us. We had to ask them to pack them for us, because we had to be rolled out of the restaurant.\n\nBill came out to be $300 with tip, two bottles of Evian and one glass of wine. Quite pricey, but worth it!\n\nI hope you have a chance to visit this sophisticated, yet humble restaurant. I will DEFINITELY return.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-09-16", "description": "I went to La Folie back in July when my friend's parents were nice enough to take me out a swank restaurant in San Francisco.  We ended up at the wrong restaurant at first, so we were about 20 minutes late for our reservation.  However, the wait staff at La Folie took it in stride and seated us promptly and cordially.\n\nI rarely eat French food because it's often too rich for my blood; gout at 24 doesn't sound entirely appealing; so YMMV when eating here.  Here's my break down:\n\nDecor & Ambiance:  Everything was pretty and not designed in such a decadent manner to make you feel uncomfortable and garish.  As per usual for an upscale restaurant, La Folie adopted the low-light/candlelight approach to give the place a glow.  I sat in the front room and it was certainly roomy and cozy at the same time.  \n\nI took a peek into the backroom for fun, and it looked like someone smashed a jester into the wall.  Take my advice and try to stay out of the private room.  The restaurant is extremely quiet--I felt a little rude for laughing loud quite a few times--but what is good food without mirth?  The only other people there: a couple in their upper-50s dressed to the nines; and a young couple out on a date dressed in their weekend bests (he in Banana Republic; she in Forever 21).  It was cozy and everyone (but me) seemed to be comfortable--so it's a pretty place for a date.\n\nFood:  We did the three course meal (which is more like five), and here's my break down.  I don't really remember the names, but here I go.\n\nWine: The Sommelier paired our meal with a decent bottle of wine from Sensorium (2003 Cab)--the price was well over $100 for a $35 bottle of wine.  It was good, but not -that- good.\n\nStarter: I had a clear duck broth with truffle stuffed ravioli.  Nothing too special until you get down to the last bite, and that's only because black truffles have an overpowering flavor.\n\nTruffle-infused whipped egg in shell - This was actually kind of fantastic.  It was light and airy and the truffle was wonderfully infused in the mixture.  The preparation was fantastic for the art-junkies and incredibly cute for those who like cute things.\n\nEntree: Quail and Squab stuffed with mushrooms.  Everything was going well until the entree.  This dish sucked. a lot.  In fact, it was a whole bucket of suck.  I'm more than happy to eat raw beef, salmon, or tuna--but semi-raw quail is not good at all.  It took all my effort to cut into the meat and chew without trying to gag.  In fact, I just had to swallow the thing because it took me so long to eat.  The kicker?  It had zero taste.  I'm okay with bland food, but bland French is odd.\n\nMy friend had the \"Le Boeuf,\" which he claimed was fantastic--especially the burger rossini.  Again, YMMV.\n\nCherry Gazpacho with almond slivers to cleanse our palate.  Worked wonders and tasted great.  Since I'm pretty allergic to cherries and almonds, it was sort of neat drinking this thing and itching along the way.  On the plus side, it was a great refresher after a meaty entree--on the negative side: I was itching for the next 2 hours.\n\nDessert: I had \"the Sunset\" which is essentially chocolate lava cake with vanilla.  The cake was really dry--I've had better dessert at Triptych, so I was a tad disappointed.  I can't remember what my friends had, but all in all, it was anticlimactic.\n\nAt the end of dinner, they gave us a platter of sweets (dried fruits, turkish delights, and chocolate).  It looked incredibly delightful, but I skipped out because I was so full by the end of everything.\n\nThe bill between three people (3 courses) + 1 bottle of wine totaled to roughly $500.00.  I was full, but didn't have anything super positive to say about the food.  The service, however, was fantastic.  They were cordial, warm, and caught us a cab while we hung out indoors.\n\nWould I recommend it?  No.  While service is great, I think Clementine, while having less flair, has more flavor in their food.  So to each their own.", "author": "Florence Y."}

EVERYTHING had foie gras in it and it was so amazing. Even the dessert they managed to pull off with foie gras and it was off the hook good. I was in a liver coma.\n\nService was a little stuffy and awkward. Also, I was getting a bit antsy, damn 3.5 hour dinners drive me bonkers - hurry it up! The place is stuck in the early 90's decor wise but I guess that adds to the charm. \n\nThey had this one rabbit dish that tried to do an interpretation of the animal in all kinds of different forms - this was gross. This is why I've knocked a star down. The flavors were bland and very unexciting. The textures were strange as well. \n\nOverall a lovely experience. Haven't been back since foie gras was outlawed (did I mention how much that sucks!) but I'd give it a shot again.

But when I went there last night on a business dinner I was very disappointed.  The service was amazing but the food was just...off and it started with their signature seared foie gras.\n\n-Seared Foie Gras.  How big does foie gras need to be?  In the context of a 3+ course menu options, a 5-6oz foie gras is too big.  Like me, my dining companions didn't want to just \"leave it there\" so we ended up consuming the whole thing and felt sick throughout dinner.  The huckleberry sauce also tasted a bit burnt.  \n-Frog legs.  Not a lot of flavor just mediocre.  It was like chicken on a toothpick if you ask me.  It was dry and tasteless.\n-Lobster Risotto.  Got this on recommendation of waiter.  Was not salted enough and was bland.\n-Rack of lamb.  Delicious because it was the only thing properly executed but again not wow.  \n-Desserts were good overall.  The souffle and baked alaska were both amazing.  \n\nThe only standout at the table (among 7 diners) was the Dourade and the Lobster with Ravioli but the overall experience of the food was just not that great or remarkable.  \n\nSo I've been asking around work colleagues if they've had \"off experiences\" and funny enough, a couple of folks have commented that their last La Folie experience was not that great.  I'm not sure if chef has changed or we came on a bad night (Tuesday).  The chef came out and I was surprised to see how young he was.  I seem to remember chef being much older.  \n\nMy only request to La Folie would be to please reduce the size of the foie gras, esp. after what these geese go through seems a shame to offer such a big size, esp. when you are only going to enjoy the first 3-4 bites.  Perhaps the chef if quietly making a political statement about foie gras itself--like the poor geese we are being stuffed to enjoy their sacrifice.", "author": "Tom K."}

I noticed a couple who dined here on their first date, and they seemed really awkward and new to fine dining. The lady was texting on her phone throughout the entire dinner! Poor guy... But I digress (and now you can see I have a knack for people watching).\n\nLa Folie is great for exploring French-Californie cuisine in San Fran. All the other courses must not have been all that new or exciting, because the only thing I remember about this dinner was the stuffed pheasant! I never had such a perfectly prepared bird. I had this dish as my fourth course, and I wish that either a) they served WAY smaller portions, or b) it was served to me earlier because by the time I got to this course I was quite full. \n\nThis restaurant is located in a really hilly area. Bring cash for valet parking, because parking is pretty terrible. Unless you have unusually large capacity, I recommend you don't finish each course so that you are able to enjoy all of them without busting a seam in your fancy attire (semi-formal/formal dress, men's jackets required).", "author": "Trinity G."}

I have a nut allergy and after informing our waiter of this, he not only pointed out all the dishes that were free of nuts, but also assured me that if any of the other entrees looked appealing, they could just remove the nuts from the ingredients.  To add to this, he even made sure that walnut oil was removed from my girlfriend's salad since he knew we would be sharing.  Unbelievable.\n\nWe were surprised multiple times throughout the meal by complimentary Chef treats which were amazingly delicious.\n\nFinally, after a wonderful experience (where time admittedly got away from us), I realized we had only 23 minutes until the curtain opened at the San Francisco Ballet. My girlfriend thought we had zero chance of making it in (they shut the doors at the curtain)...we were pleasantly surprised.  As soon as I informed the waiter of our situation he had the check to me, had our car waiting at the valet, and even managed to get the dessert we had ordered (which had to be rushed since it was a chocolate fondant with a liquid center) in a bag for us to take along.  \n\nThe price is expensive, but if you're looking for top notch service and a great ambiance where the tables aren't on top of one another, this is the place.", "author": "Ian C."}

La Folie requires a credit card to reserve. The terms state in the first paragraph that cancellation before 3 pm is without penalty. The second paragraph states that cancellatoin is subject to fees, in this case a $75 charge per person in the form of a gift certificate. Based on the unambiguous wording of the first paragraph, I made the reservation. \n\nI had to cancel and did so before 3 pm, leaving a message. When I called later to confirm, Paula noted that I had indeed cancelled earlier, but she was still charging the $150 fee. She remarked that the OpenTable wording is a problem La Folie has been attempting to correct, so this is a problem known to them. I sent an email to La Folie management without response so far. I stated that essentially La Folie misled me and likely other clients with its cancellation policy. I feel that this treatment is beneath the stature of La Folie and sullies its reputation.

The amuse bouches - lobster was eh but the perfectly poached egg was just that...perfect. The apps - when can you go wrong w/seared foie gras. It was great. We also tried the lobster risotta, which the fiance was not happy with...it was very grainy. I had the roe dish (awesome, nice and light, great flavors) and the pigs feet/sweetbread (robust, hearty dish - it was also great). Dishes - the butter poached lobster (my dish) was very surprising. I was expecting a tiny piece of lobster and an even tinier ravioli. It was fairly filling, tasty and big! Fiance had the roti of quail/squab - highly, highly recommend. This was probably the best quail dish we've ever had. Desserts were equally good (chocolate/passion fruit dish and warm edam cheese souffle) - also highly recommend the cheese souffle.

It's a date night place for sure. It's so romantic and you just can't help but focus on the conversation between you and your date --- something about it ooze romance. There are many tables for couples and the restaurant itself is pretty small. Which is probably why it's pretty hard to make reservations here. \n\nIf you want authentic french food. This is the place to get it. I had - I'm not kidding you - including chef tasting dishes, at least a 6 course meal. The bread. It's warm with a crispy malty crust on the outside and soft bread in the inside. The dungeness crab salad is probably the lightest dish out of the menu. It was unexpectedly spiced with curry. That combination worked very well together. The foie gras is so rich, silky, and creamy you just want to die in it. The liberty duck breast is a work of art. It's presented in an artful way. It was paired with caramelized apple and cranberry which lightened the heaviness of the duck. I was stuffed before the duck for here and I wish I had a bigger appetite because I don't feel like I was fully able to enjoy every bite of my food because I was too overwhelmed by how stuffed I was. Despite that, I knew dessert was not a dish to skip. I ordered the bittersweet chocolate fondant. If you're a chocolate lover - you've get layers and layers and layers of this.  \n\nThis place is worth trying but I recommend starving yourself for the day because the food is SO rich. \n\nThe wine is impeccable.

He had made reservations and we were seated right away. Like many other yelpers have commented the tables are spaced out nicely so you can actually hear what the person sitting across from you is actually saying! \n\nThe service is impeccable! Very friendly, pleasant, and very accommodating, especially when it came to ordering from the menu. Our server was so sharp and attentive as she noticed that I am pregnant. She assisted in moving the table out so that I can sit on the booth seat with ease. And in terms of ordering from the menu, she was attentive to dietary concerns. \n\nThe food was absolutely divine! We were able to pick and choose courses. Everything was delicious and with both of us ordering the 4course meal... The portions were perfect: no portion was too small or too big.\n\n\nOur first amuse bouche -- my husband was given duck liver mousse. And I was soooo pleased when they gave me a refreshing heirloom beet salad with a lite vinaigrette and (what I think was) either a mini dollop of creme fraiche or goat cheese. \n\nWe were also served yummy, crusty & warm bread. As much as we would have loved to just eat only the bread. We refrained, knowing that the meal was JUST BEGINNNING!\n\nOur second amuse bouche-- an espresso sized cup of green garlic soup topped with a potato crisp. Very smooth and velvety, not overpowering.\n\nAppetizers--  my husband and I both had a cream of asparagus soup with wild mushrooms. My husband's also came with lobster and a poached quail egg. I opted not to have any included with my soup. Once again... Very smooth and velvety, and very comforting. If they made this and the beet salad my meal alone, I probably would have been just as content.\n\n2nd course-- my husband had a butter lobster tail. And I had risotto with asparagus, wild mushrooms, and fava beans topped with a wild mushroom broth foam. --sigh-- once again... Very comforting!\n\n3rd course-- my husband had the rack of lamb with braised kale accompanied by lamb tongue.  I had the liberty farm duck breast and crisp duck confit gateau accompanied by duck tongue. Both dishes also came with a couple of roasted turnips ( though my husband's dish also came with a couple of carrots and white asparagus spears, too.). Both dishes were superb. Both meats were tender and moist, and cooked to perfection.\n\nA palate cleanser before dessert-- lemon curd with a hazelnut crumble, candied citrus, and a candied beet sliver.\n\n4th and final course-- DESSERT!!! My husband had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a chocolate truffle cake, and strawberry-almond ice cream.  YUM!  I had the \" warm sunset\" the bittersweet chocolate fondant cake with a creme anglaise with a caramel sauce swirl, brandied fruit, and a strawberry tulle.  Double YUM!!!\nI think if we had ordered the 5 course meal, they probably would have needed to \"roll\" us out of the restaurant to our car.:)\n\nBut wait! That's not all!... Compliments of the restaurant, a plate of petit fours( a couple of each--cannales, nougats, chocolate hazelnut bars, and dried apricot gelees.). \n\nWould highly recommend for special occasion-- anniversary, date night, or..

My dining partner who is not a fish fan thought it was one of the best fish dishes he ever had.  I was a little concerned I would not like this dish, as I'm not an uni fan, but now I'm a convert.\n\nThird course was venison, which again was perfectly cooked medium rare, super tender and flavorful. \n\nFourth - Melted super stinky cheese with croutons. Damn I love me some stinky cheese! (was excellent with the wine). \n\nFifth - some really pretty chocolate concoction. A small globe of delicate chocolate cake covered in shiny chocolate ganache, several sauces adorned the plate as well as some whimsy sugar art.\n\nOverall the dishes were just beautufully prepared.  The plated dishes simply look like artwork.  You take a bite of this, a bite of that, then all the components together and it's like a symphony.

The restaurant seems to change menu on a monthly basis. And when I was there in Feb, the restaurant featured a black truffle tasting menu. (If you think the tasting menu is too pricy or you don't like all of the items, you can totally pick and choose - just have to pay $10-$25 extra per individual dish). I had the soup from the black truffle menu (it's a white bean soup served with a custard and a big slice of black truffle with some small cubes of black black truffle as well). My boyfriend and I had a five course dinner and we were so satisfied by the end. \n\nAnother item that surprised me was the black pepper gelato that served with the chocolate bombe.

Made reservations a week and a half ahead of time and still could only get a 9:30 reservation.  It's quite the popular place!  When we walked in, it was not what I expected.  Very small (but later realized more rooms are hidden away) and cramped at the entrance.  I walked up to the host's podium but no one was there so I waited...and waited...and waited while three or four employees walked past me.  Finally, I flagged down the water guy and he got someone.  The hostess said they were running behind and suggested we visit the lounge next door for drinks.  \n\nThe lounge was loud but had a very cool vibe, great drinks (although a tad pricey), and some interesting people.  So we waited...and waited...and waited...and had a couple drinks each of course.  I finally went to ask the hostess about our table and she said she came to look for me but \"forgot what I looked like.\"  Okay....so we waited about 45 minutes for our 'reservations' and they didn't even offer to comp us any drinks even though she forgot me.  All in all though, not such a bad wait experience since we were with good friends and the lounge was fairly entertaining.  \n\nFinally seated in a quieter back room, the experience quickly improved.  The waitress was extremely well-versed in all of the dishes and the pace with which we received each of our 5 courses (plus two amuse-bouches and an extra dessert one since they apparently messed up my husband's cake and we had to wait for a new one) was comfortable and leisurely.  The portions were surprisingly generous and the food, being French, was very rich - I couldn't finish the last entree course but left room for dessert somehow...hmmmm.  I can't even begin to detail all of the amazing ingredients and flavors but I do remember some duck egg, sweetbreads, squab, scallops, roe, and of course, that delicious seared foie gras (get it while you can!).  Each of us at the table ordered a variety of dishes so we were able to taste many different things which was nice.  It was a great dinner but I wish we could have been seated on time since we didn't manage make it out of there until after 1 AM and had long drive back to San Jose.\n\nOverall, great time and fantastic food although I might recommend the 3 or 4-course menu if you're not a big eater or go for all 5 courses if you like a little squab and sweetbread pancake in the morning.  I'd definitely go back if a) I can book an earlier reservation, b) I feel like totally blowing my diet on deliciously rich French food, and c) someone else is buying.", "author": "Christine E."}

I went out w/ the family to this restaurant to celebrate my dad's birthday. Normally, we would prefer Ritz's Dining Room or Gary Danko's, but we decided to try a restaurant we have never been for this special occasion.\n\nFirst things first...the food. 5 course meal for 95 bucks, a relatively good deal considering the quality and class of the restaurant. Here is what i ordered and some comments (in sequence):\n\n1. Appetizer - dungeness crab salad - relatively satisfying amount of chilled, cooked crab meat on top of a rectangular-shaped cauliflower panna cotta. A solid flake of curry and drops of curry for dipping were also on the plate. Excellent dish - good combination of flavors.\n\n2. Appetizer 2 - Lobster and mushroom risotto - my favorite dish of the evening; perfectly-cooked risotto immersed in a light lobster broth with complimenting oyster mushrooms (and possibly truffles? i forget), topped off with lobster foam. Smallest proportion of food in comparison to other dishes i was served, although i felt it was still very tasty.\n\n3. Seafood - seared day boat scallop - single scallop (are you surprised?) perfectly seared and placed on top of a super delicious pile of wasabi-like, truffle-mixed mashed potatoes. There was also a very large chunk of bacon (forget what type of bacon) that was meaty and tasty without an enormous amount of fat.\n\n4. Meat - roti of squal/quail- rolled in a potato sheet, stuffed with mushrooms, and served with a mixture of delicately-plated root vegetables. The quail/duck was on too much of the rare side for me (the meat was tender, but the gamey taste also came through). \n\n5. Dessert - huckleberry baked alaska - never tried a baked alaska before, so i can't really compare sorry haha\n\nSecondly, besides the food, the service was also excellent. Kudos to our waitress. She is probably one of the rare five-star restaurant waitresses/waiters to walk the fine line between polite, proper, knowledgeable and arrogant, patronizing, and stuck-up. She was very knowledgeable, yet truly demonstrated a sense of care and service for the people at our table. She quickly adapted to our level of comprehension of the food on the menu (level zero haha) and explained the components of the dishes in a way that everyone at our table could fully understand.\n\nOverall, i believe my family and i had a wonderful experience at this fine dine establishment. While the food was not 100% perfect, it was, on the whole, in my top category of french cuisine restaurants in the SF area.", "author": "Nathan T."}

So rich and sinfully decadent, foie gras is one of my favorite foods. Sounds like dessert, but it's music to my taste buds to have a generous portion, cooked to perfection without a sinew in sight (dang it, Michael Mina). At La Folie, you can have it twice, as it is offered two ways: Barbeque Squab with a Pistachio Crusted Foie Gras Torchon AND Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Wild Oregon Huckleberries. I had the latter and it was amazing! The sweetness of it's accompaniments juxtaposed to the saltiness of the fois gras was perfect. It was a generous portion....so much so that I felt full before my main course arrived.\n\nThat was too bad because I ordered the \"La Beouf,\" which was beef three ways: Beef Tenderloin, Braised Beef Short Rib,\nand Burger Rossini with Truffle Madeira Sauce. Seriously YUM!\n\nI also tried the Niman Ranch Lamb Loin, as well as the Slow Roasted Loch Duart Salmon, both of which were very nicely done.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for three of their artisan cheeses....good but rather small selection of sheep, goat and cow cheeses...if you're into cheese, I was more impressed with the vast array offered at the Ritz and Gary Danko. I also tried my friend's Edam cheese souffle which was good. But if you prefer something sweet, I highly recommend the Valhrona Milk Chocolate Passion Fruit Bombe with Hazelnut Dacquoise, Black Pepper Gelato.\n\nService:\n\nUpon entering, my coat was immediately whisked off to the closet and out of my way. Service was prompt, courteous, friendly and funny...two of the servers were cracking jokes here and there. I loved it! AND the charming Chef Passot swung by our table to say \"hello\"...very nice :)\n\nIn Closing:\n\nThis was a great place for our celebration with a party of four. But it was also charming as heck for a romantic tryst. As I was walking in, there was a couple seated in the back of the front dining room, in the cutest little nook in the corner. I would totally suggest requesting this spot, because you get to sit on a \"bench\" sort of thing, right in the corner. They were all snuggled up against each other and obviously having a good time. They smiled at me and I smiled back....awww, love is in the air. *sigh*\n\nMight I also add that the bar mixes some stiff drinks. I had a Grey Goose L'Orange with club soda (lime and orange twist) and that sucker did me in for the rest of the evening. You gotta love it.  :D", "author": "Virg Y."}

This is absolutely delicous \"special occasion\" cuisine with very unique and artful presentation. The staff was very attentive and friendly and gave great recommendations. \n\nWe started out with a couple of the aged wines as aperitifs, and my favorite was a sweet aged wine (ambre) from the south of France which had a very distinctive taste.\n\nThey gave us a nice variety of on-the-house amuses-bouches and palate cleansers between the courses that were unique and tasty, like the carrot-ginger soup and the soft-boiled egg with cauliflour cream. \n\nAs far as what I enjoyed the most: The Hudson Valley foie gras was the best I've had here. The Butter Poached Lobster on a Butternut Squash Ravioli, Toasted Almonds, Celery Root and Apple with Truffled Poultry Jus was exceptional. The duck was well-prepared, but a bit more gamey than I usually prefer; I assume this is strictly a matter of taste. \n\nI was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of non-pasteurized cheese choices they had. I ordered two of my old favorites: the Comte and Bleu d'Auvergne, and also ordered the extremely nose-strong Epoisses which they fortunately serve with a spoonful of onion sorbet as a palate cleanser at the end. So that I didn't end up with the strong cheese to finish off the evening, they served us a variety of tasty petit-fours as well, which was much appreciated.", "author": "Shannon R."}

I felt like we had to whisper the whole time and it was incredibly stuffy.  \n\n   For the most part, the food was bland.  I had the lobster bisque to start and it needed a ton of salt.  They also brought us some sort of soup in an egg shell with a coagulated egg yolk at the bottom.  Yeah, disgusting.  A friend of mine had completely overcooked and tasteless frog legs.  My main course was the trio of beef.  The slider was rock hard and overcooked.  Perhaps this 4 star restaurant needs some pointers from Super Duper.  The tenderloin was decent but nothing special and was at least cooked medium rare.  The short rib was probably the best thing I had all dinner and was delicious.  I forgot what I had for dessert which is indicative.  They brought out some cookies and sweet things which were also pretty boring.  \n\nThe service was fantastic although the constant descriptions of the food gets tiresome.

It was a pre-fixe menu, and if it was any indication of how great this place is, I can't wait for the next occasion to return. \n\nThe first course was a creamy parsnip soup served in an adorable cup for sipping. I loved it, but due to my sensitive stomach, I knew better than to finish mine. It was too rich for my boyfriend's taste, otherwise he could have had the rest of mine. Seeing its creamy goodness go to waste broke my heart. \n\nFor the second course, we both chose the lobster risotto. UNBELIEVABLE! I make risotto at home often because I love it even though it's a hassle. It was delicate and light, slightly creamy with the right amount of salt. The lobster added the perfect amount of extra flavor without dominating too much. For me, that's one of the hardest parts of making risotto. The rice on its own doesn't have much flavor so you're tempted to add all kinds of things, but it's so much better when  you don't over-do it. \n\nFor the main course, I got the butterfish and my boyfriend got the steak. This was typical of us; I usually get fish and he gets beef. However we both agreed this was the best beef and fish we'd ever had together. And that's a lot of meals to be compared to! The butterfish was soft and delicate, melting in my mouth like a fish never has before. I tried a bite of the steak, and it was incredible! So tender and flavorful. I can see why it was the best he'd had. It might have been the best I'd had too, but it's hard to say since I was raised on steak and BBQ. \n\nThe dessert was a chocolate cake filled with chocolate bread pudding and raspberry sorbet. Usually I'm not a fan of bread pudding, but this was more like eating a molten chocolate lava cake. As each bite exploded in my mouth, and was followed by a bite of the sorbet, I thought to myself, this couldn't get any better. \n\nDespite the small portions, by the end of the meal I had to unzip my dress under my jacket because I was so stuffed. Definitely the mark of a meal to remember. \n\nAnd as a bonus, the waiter brought us little boxes of Recchiuti bon bons. So cute.

I was pretty disappointed recently, esp since I remembered this place to be more cozy (decor, atmosphere) and culinarily memorable when I was last here 5-11yrs ago. \n\nI honestly like the old decor better, when the place felt more intimate. There's more space now and they're going for a certain look, but it's not necessary if the food is superb... The aura of the staff didn't help much either. Our waitress's spiels and the serving timing with her people didn't really flow, and one server was careless, bumping into my table wares (point deduction noted). \n\nThe entrees and the dessert were fine (not necessarily to die for), but the seafood appetizers, esp the roe, were so diappointing!!!  They used hijiki and anchovy and other ingriedients that's less common in french cuisine, so I was curious to see how they would taste. But I've tasted much better elsewhere (for less, I'm sure)...  The lobster risotto tasted good, but it was weird how the smell and taste didn't go hand in hand.  \n\nIt just felt like they were trying too hard, modernizing too much, Iron-Chef-ing it but not making the fullest of each ingriedient.  Frankly, they're more into the appearance, and even the compliments didn't shock my tastebuds as you would think.  There's something about their use of vegetables that wasn't enticing. All veggies looked and tasted the same on every dish... why? I want every dish and every sauce to be inspiring and creative; I didn't get that. Even if we didn't order the entire Chef's menu, the fact that we are at a French restaurant means I want that authentic, ONLY-in-french-cuisine-can-we-get this kind of feeling when you taste your food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-12", "description": "It was a rainy Friday night, so getting into the city took much longer than expected, but the hostess was still gracious about our tardiness and seated us immediately.  Parking is definitely difficult, and as we were running late, we decided to just go for the valet.  I was a little surprised they didn't come open my door for me, and they asked for us to pay up front.  I know it was raining, but I thought they'd at least come to my door for $15..\n\nThe restaurant has two main rooms.  The front one is much more lively and noisy.  We were tucked away in the back, and it started out a bit cold, but it warmed up as the room filled up.  I liked the back room - it had a very 1500s French feel to it, with green walls and dim lighting.  It had a lot of character, and the tables are spaced nicely.\n\nThere was a $95 5-course tasting, but we opted to choose our own 5 courses for $95.  There are pages and pages of full and half bottles of wines, mostly French and American, along with many by the glass.  It was a nice variety, and the prices were pretty reasonable.  We started with some warm, crusty french rolls, which had a slight hint of sourdough.  It was perfect for soaking up some of the extra sauces.\n\nThe first amuse was a sliced lobster salad with small bits of apple, pomegranate, and a celery puree.  The celery flavor came across fairly strong, and there was a generous amount of lobster.  It was really light and refreshing.  The next amuse was a soft boiled organic egg with cream and bacon, topped with a potato sheath.  It was a nice progression, as it was warm and more filling.\n\nMy first course was the dungeness crab salad, served over a very light and amazingly smooth cauliflower panna cotta.  Roe and curry vinaigrette were brightly scattered around the edge of the plate.  The pieces of crab were meaty, large, and fresh, and it was a great opener.  My boyfriend got the duck consomme with foie gras, and the broth was so clear and light - it tasted like the essence of duck, without other herbs/flavors overpowering it.\n\nNext was the lobster and mushroom risotto.  The lobster meat was sweet, and the mushrooms were meaty.  However, the risotto wasn't as creamy as I'd like.  The creaminess came more from the lobster bisque than the starchiness of the rice, and the texture was a little underdone for me.  My boyfriend had the tasting of roe, which had three different presentations of infused roe.\n\nThen there came the lobster was next, served over a butternut squash ravioli.  The meat was out of the shell and cooked very tenderly.  All the flavors were light, and it had a nice combination of textures when you got everything in the perfect bite.\n\nThe scallops were crisped all around - not like your typical scallop.  It was crusted on the outside without being too buttery, but it was still sweet inside.  The apple puree was a perfect match for it, and the giant piece of bacon on the side was cooked to the point where most of the fat was gone, and it had a nice smokiness to it.  The butterfish was also cooked well.  It was pretty firm but not overdone, and it had more flavor than most white fish.  It sat atop different colored cauliflower.\n\nFinally was the lamb, which had a very rich and full gastrique underneath.  It was tender and easily removed from the bone.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the savory gruyere cheese souffle. It was nicely crisped on the top, but still a bit sweet and smooth/creamy inside.  The creme fraiche ice cream and crunchy bits underneath didn't really go with the souffle, but they were nice as a side item.\n\nWe finished off with petit fours and a candle for my boyfriend's birthday, which I thought was a nice touch.  Service was very prompt, and the meal was nicely paced.  We never felt rushed or pressured, and everyone was very unpretentious.  It was definitely one of the better meals I've had recently.  It's nice for a romantic night out, but I would definitely recommend the back room, if possible.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

The restaurant was warm, modern, and intimate all at the same time.  Very cosy, but not in a B&B stuffy kind of way.  The restaurant makes you feel comfortable from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave.  It was the right mix of interaction with my party, the staff, as well as enjoying the surrounding company of other diners.\n*Service:  Impecable.  Our waitress did an amazing job of not just serving us, but helping us select our dishes, (I will admit this up front) informing us about the generous portions, and presenting our food.  And when I say presenting, I mean presenting.  I felt like every dish she put in front of us was not only visually appealing, but had an auditory appeal I was not expecting as she described each dish.  She was amazing.\n\nHowever, there is a reason I am only giving this place 3-stars, and it all came down to one aspect:\n\n*Portions:  I think this is where this restaurant suffered the most.  My dinner companions persuaded me to get the 5-course meal, and although I had eaten very light all day, I had barely made it through the second course before my stomach started to reach it's limit.  We had three amuse bouche before the meal had even begun: each one interesting in their own right, but had I known we would be receiving so much food even before the meal had begun, I likely would have stuck with the 3-course.\n\nNext came the freshly baked bread which was delicious, but again I would have skipped them knowing the size of the main portions.  \n\nFirst came the asparagus soup, one of my favorite dishes of the night.  However, I forced myself to stop eating about 2/3 of the way through since I was already filling up.  Next came the tempura fried duck egg on a potato cake (a rather large appetizer of it's own), which was pretty good but I was starting to fret over the rest of the meal since my stomach was already pretty full.  \n\nNext came the tasting of roe - an oyster, about half a cup of ceviche, and sashimi.  I had the oyster and the sashimi, but had to give the ceviche to my boyfriend because I was at the stage where I was forcing myself to eat something I didn't want.  \n\nFinally the lobster came, the one item I had been looking forward to all day.  I felt ill eating it, but I forced myself to because what sane person is going to ask for a doggie bag for an entire lobster tail and claw.  I also couldn't finish this and gave the rest to my boyfriend.  Then dessert, forget about that.

However, all six of us (including three healthy young men who balk at the words \"no thank you\") all left significant portions of uneaten food on our plates.  \n\nPersonally, I don't like eating to the point where I feel queasy well into the next day, and I wish either the waitress had actively dissuaded at the women from ordering more than 3 courses and the men from ordering more than four OR the portions of the appetizers were half the size of what we had consumed for the night.

I've eaten at a number of San Francisco's best restaurants, and this one goes at the top of my list. \n\nI begin with my only reservation -- if I could give 4.5 stars, I would. Our reservation was 8:45 PM on a Saturday, on the latter side of the dinner rush. But our table wasn't ready, so they suggested we head next door to the Lounge (also excellent, by the way), for a drink. That's fine. We had an excellent Dark and Stormy and a variation on a Gimlet. But our table wasn't ready for 35 minutes, and that's a bit annoying. \n\nWe selected the four-course menu. I'll not comment on every course, just the ones I remember being truly outstanding (though everything was good). The bread was also notably quite good. \n\n- Amuse-bouche: My favorite was the tiny curry egg salad bite, though the softbound some-sort-of-smaller-than-chicken egg was good too. \n- Tempura Duck Egg: Really innovative and tasty. \n- Frog Legs: Small but good. Honestly a little too small (I'm used to meatier frog legs), but they were good so I'll overlook it. \n- Foie Gras Torchon: Really excellent. Innovative flavors. The crust at the bottom of the torchon was some sort of peanut brittle -- sweet combined with fatty-yet-flavorful foie gras. Very yummy. \n- Lobster and Mushroom Risotto: PERFECT. This was the only dish I wanted a bit more of. I don't know how they keep the lobster so tender while cooking the other ingredients. \n- Lamb Rack with tongue: Really delicious. I'd never had lamb tongue and found it really tasty. Perfectly cooked, though not super innovative. \n- Peanut Butter Opera Cake: Almost seemed like a huge peanut butter-filled Kit Kat Bar. Very tasty. \n- Chevre Cheesecake: OK. I'm the guy that always, always, always orders chocolate, but this sounded good. And man, was I right! This was an awesome rich, perfectly-sweet-and-tart cheesecake. And the black pepper ice cream was amazing. I wouldn't have guessed it had black pepper in it absent the menu as the flavors were so subtle. \n\nThe service was superlative. They chilled the bottle of wine we brought perfectly, and guided this wannabe-oenophile to a good second bottle (they waive the corkage if you buy a bottle) without making me feel idiotic, a great skill to have. \n\nWe left stuffed, happy, and slightly drunk. It was great.", "author": "Tom P."}

Had the heirloom tomato salad and it had these little crunchy brown things on it that looked like little worms.  I kept thinking that they were worms in the back of my head, so it kinda ruined the dish for me.  Also had the tasting of the roe, but I found my oyster to be a little pasty.  For some reason, it didn't that taste fresh to me.  Aside from that, the butter poached lobster was amazing!  I wish I asked for the salmon lollipops tho.

Our experience started with  our waiter coming by holding a basket filled with 2 large black truffles which he held under our noses. Trust me once you smelled black gold you cannot forget about it anymore. Therefore we ordered the extra dish - Lobster Risotto with shaved black truffles.\n\nEvery single course came out perfect, my personal favorite: Seared Foie Gras accompanied with a Foie Gras soup, served in a Cafe Latte cup. Presentation and execution was A+. \nFood portions are generous (but thankfully smaller than Gary Danko's) and we left happy and satisfied with the petite fours in a to go box.\n \nIt was the best french cuisine I ever had along with an amazing service experience.

At least until I'm done with the kick.  \n\nAfter reading several comments from various San Francisco restaurants, it appeared that La Folie was considered the favorite for one of the best foie gras in the area.  So, we pretty much went here just to get the seared foie gras.  Honestly, it was fantastic.  I don't know how he sears the foie gras but they do a fantastic job and it is amazing.  I'm really giving 4 stars simply because of the foie gras.\n\nAs for everything else???  We found it hit or miss.  There is considerable effort on the presentation side and the types of food that was prepared.  Somewhat on the artistic side with a dash of molecular gastronomy.  The problem is that not everything I tried tasted great.  Some things appeared to be average.  \n\nThere are plenty of places to eat at in San Francisco and there are plenty of \"top-rated\" restaurants to boot.  La Folie is considered one of the best in the area.  There is a lot of value here and I'm prolly being picky with some things.  Nonetheless, I'm still giving it 4 stars.  I think its a great restaurant.  However, I'm prolly not gonna come here again to get anything else but the seared foie gras.

Simply describing the items on the menu will not do the food justice. Instead, I'll focus on the sensations delivered by each course. \n\nCompliments of the chef: Crab garnish with olive oil and vinegar. A delightful surprise to the taste buds, just enough flavor to perk you up and keep you interested. Almost makes you want to order a second serving but you refrain because you can't wait to see what else is in store. I refrained. \n\nLeek soup served in scalloped egg-shell garnished with a single potato crisp . This is when the party got interesting. At first glance, \"wtf\" came to mind.

I'm usually very critical because it's hardly ever done right. This serving was perfect. Crab salad garnished with caviar = to DIE for. Started off as normal: fresh, juicy, perfectly seasoned.

He made our anniversary a memorable one. \n\nI ordered the 3 course meal --  dungeness crab salad, butter poached lobster, and molten chocolate lava cake for dessert. The curry from the crab salad didn't sit too well on my palette, but it was a refreshing dish. The lobster was cooked to perfection. The cake wasn't overly sweet, exactly how I like it. However the dried fruit that comes with it was doused in brandy and I just couldn't handle it. \n\nHe ordered the 4 course meal -- foie gras torchon, lobster and mushroom risotto, duck breast, and peach Melba baked alaska. He was very happy with his choices and says his favorite was the risotto. I tried it and it was so creamy and rich and I loved how the veggies added a bite tthanks dish.\n\nRight when we thought we had ordered just the right amount of food, they presented us with complimentary dishes! Before our appetizers we had an amuse bouche made with ahi tuna with tomato water and chili oil topped with a crispy wonton. Then we had a poached organic egg with a crispy brioche to dip into the egg yolk (so good!!). After our appetizers and entrees, they gave us something to cleanse our palettes.  It was a ginger and cantaloupe drink in a shot glass. So good, too!! Then came our delicious desserts. By this time I was STUFFED, but there's always room for dessert, right? I managed to get through most of my cake and called it a night. But after they cleared away our dessert plates, out comes a plate of petite fours for each of us! How could I resist?! I can't recall exactly what was on the plate since by this point I was pretty drunk off of all the food, but there was a jelly/gum drop type dessert, a madeline with a dried cherry in the middle, a chocolate caramel dessert with a crunch to it, and a very creamy dark chocolate square. \n\nI cannot recommend La Folie enough.

I would give this 5 stars (for the food), but I had to take down one because of the mediocre service we got. My boyfriend took me here on our 1 year anniversary and I couldn't be more thrilled! I've always wanted to eat here. However, as we stepped into the restaurant, we felt that the hostess' demeanor was a little chilly. She wasn't quite rude, but she definitely was not warm and inviting. We were then guided to this nice little table in the back room, almost ready to sit down, only for the man to tell us he made a mistake and please follow him back outside! Wth? We followed him back to where he stuck us smack dab in the middle of the room next to a noisy big party (with a lady who laughed a very annoying, loud laugh every 5 minutes), and where I felt the cold SF draft every time the door was open. Deduct half a star. I was already a little unhappy, but I was determined to enjoy my meal.  The other half star is deducted for the not-so-great sommelier. She came by and was really pushy and we ended up getting an expensive bottle of wine because we felt pressured to. (It was however, a delightful bottle of wine). I think we  felt a little mistreated and got intimidated, which has never happened before at a higher end dining establishment. \n\nOn to the food....\nI'll have to say this was one of my most memorable food experiences. Everything we ate was AMAZING (minus the squab dish, but I think it was more of my personal taste, because it was cooked perfectly medium rare). We had two amuse bouche - one was a octopus/scallop salad w. yuzu dressing and one was a egg yolk poached in it's own shell w/ cream, brioche crouton, and potato chip. Delish!\nIn the order of service, here are the dishes we ate:\n-Dungeness Crab Salad - refreshing, sweet, wonderful mix of textures \n-an AMAZING huge piece of foie gras, enhanced by a sweet, berry, star anise-laced glaze\n-a perfect portion of rich, satisfying, buttery lobster risotto, cooked perfectly al dente\n-a beautifully plated piece of Hawaiin butterfish, tender and rich, accompanied by an uni sauce and  a creamy sauce,  served atop a melange of colorful broccoli and cauliflower \n-TO DIE FOR butter poached lobster over a butternut squash ravioli. This was so sooo good. The butternut squash and buttery, tender lobster went perfectly together. I could eat ten of these!\n-my least favorite dish, quail and squab roti, creatively wrapped with crispy potato strings and stuffed with mushrooms. Presently beautifully and it was cooked very well, but I couldn't get over the gamey taste. I enjoyed the veggies that came with it.\n-An interesting, almost savory dessert. A not-too-sweet  warm cheese souffle topped with bacon bits and served with a side of cheese (fromage) sorbet. It was a very pretty dish and I loved the tiny cup the souffle was baked in. It was a perfect sized dessert. The combination of warm souffle and cold sorbet was delightful!\n-A pretty classic Baked Alaska - you cant go wrong with ice cream and meringue! Very pretty plating as well and perfectly torched meringue\n- Last but not least, an assortment of after dinner petite fours. It was a nice sweet ending to an awesome meal! Cleverly presented on a marble slab (with a very expensive bill). \n\nI definitely recommend this place! Maybe you'll get better service than we did.", "author": "Mina T."}

This is a place that goes out of their way to ensure that customers are enjoying their meal. There was no stuffiness whatsoever. Here...the customer is king.\nWe started out with a couple of starters from the chef.\n-The pouched egg yolk with butternut squash soup inside an egg shell was as tasty as it was beautiful.\nEach course had a surprisingly large portion size.\n-The dungeness crab salad was light and refreshing. Mixing well with the pea panna cotta.\n-The fois and cherry consumme was rich and delectable. The sweetness of the sauce added contrast to the rich fois. It was a little too much fois for me though. Once again, the portions are HUGE\n-The butter pouched lobster with parsnip ravioli and truffle fondue was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Man...I'm a feen for truffles now.\n-The loin, rack, and leg of rabbit was classical and perfectly executed. The meat was tender and well seasoned. Even the rabbit liver on the side was tasty.\nAt this point I was already full beyond belief. But the baked alaska couldn't be any better. Warm and crisp on the outside, with amazing ice cream in the middle. It looked like a work of art when it arrived.\nI appreciate experiencing the chef's creation of a meal. However, I really enjoyed the fact that the diner has some choice in what he wants. Again, you can basically have it however you want. They'd probably shave truffles on your dessert if you want!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-06", "description": "So, my wife and I made reservations here 7 years ago when we first moved to the bay area.  We ended up canceling because we had no jobs (probably a smart move).\n\nFinally we made it back here.  It was quite amazing.  I really don't get how a few of the reviews are just \"meh\".  I was prepared for a high-end French meal, but just *how* high-end--I wasn't prepared for it.  It blew both of us away.\n\nFor us, this surpassed a few of the other places in SF that are supposedly better--Michael Mina comes to mind.  We *love* Michael Mina, but this was just another level above.\n\nMy wife ordered a 3-course meal and I ordered a 4-course so we could share the dessert.  There were another 3-4 smaller courses/tastes in between what we ordered, so be prepared that you will definitely get more food than you're ordering. \n\nAs far as the actual food, we were amazed by everything.  I had a chilled pea soup with sweet onion sorbet as an appetizer.  I'm not crazy about peas, and this was VERY pea-y, but wow was it good!  The lobster risotto was also fantastic, as was the beef 3-ways.  It was a small filet mignon, a short rib, and a mini burger with foie gras.  If I had to eat the exact same menu again the next night I wouldn't hesitate!  \n\nIn addition, there was a special taste of an egg (poached, I think), with a smoky tomato sauce served INSIDE an eggshell with a thin potato chip on top. The chip had a single sprig of chive through it.  This was served on a special plate just for the eggshell.  We sat for a few minutes really just admiring the craftsmanship of the dish.\n\nFinally, the staff was fantastic. They were attentive and professional as can be while still being quite friendly and not stuffy.  One server was actually quite funny.  It was great to have such a wonderful meal while not feeling like everyone is taking it too seriously.  I mean, food is supposed to be fun, right?\n\nThe bill was actually quite reasonable for what we got!  Don't get me wrong, it is expensive, but for the two of us for a 3- and 4- course meal, plus wine and tip and tax, it came to just under $300.  Not cheap, but you can do WAY worse in the city.\n\nOne note, there was ONE table we noticed in the whole restaurant that was just sitting near the door.  When we walked in, I thought \"I hope we don't get that table\".  We didn't.  If possible, note it on your reservation so you don't have it.  I don't think it would have been a major problem for us, but it just felt really open and on a cool night you may get blasts of cool air when the door opens.\n\nWhew!  To wrap it up, La Folie was amazing.  Can't wait to get back!", "author": "Brian S."}

I've dined at many Michelin starred places, and I expect leaving the restaurant with a big smile and happy belly, but no...my tummy was unhappy. Service was Excellent, food was good, though the amuses-bouches weren't very impressive. And it all has something to do with the GINORMOUS Foie Gras. \n\nLobster corn soup: was perfectly balanced with the sweetness, the creaminess, and the swimming chuncky lobster. Loved the natural sweetness from the corns.\n\nBaked snails and bone marrow served in the bone: excellent dish, loved the variety of textures, some crispiness on top, slightly chewy snails, creamy marrow...yum!\n\nFOIE GRAS: When it arrived, I was shocked, 1.5x my palm size, 1.5\"+ thick, seriously, it could be larger than any fillet mignon served at a french restaurant. It was served on top of a toasted brioche bread, huckleberry sauce, and aged maple syrup. I was SO excited about it. After eating the first 1/3 of it, I was done. I ran out of the tart huckleberry sauce, and the balance of the dish went off, too greasy, too sweet, and my plate was covered with a huge mess of fat. This is what over-the-top is. The foie was cooked perfectly, sauce was excellent, but it was just TOO HUGE. \n\nNow I craved a spoonful of sorbet to refresh my taste bud...but it kept going...\n\nLobster: perfectly cooked, nice cream sauce, salad was bland. \n\nDuck breast: perfectly cooked, medium rare the way I liked it, but my taste bud was numbed by the greasy foie gras. Still craving for something refreshing...so the bitter greens served with the breast actually tasted awesome.\n\nRack of lamb: yum, clean and simple. You could taste the premium quality of the meat, like a classy gorgeous lady. \n\nFINALLY, something refreshing arrived, a tiny spoonful of strawberry jam with cardamom cream. It excited my sense again after the foie coma.\n\nChocolate Fondant: \"Foie Gras and Chocolate Fondant cake are not to be ordered in a same menu\" should be mentioned on the menu. Its center is nice and gooey, top slightly crispy, great, but after finishing the melty part of the cake, which is about 1/3, it gets so dense that it tastes dry to me. Again, it has so much to do with the previous foie, maybe it'll taste differently otherwise. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a GREAT restaurant, Rolland is an amazing chef, but the dinner left my stomach unpleasant for the next 24 hours. Thinking back, it's all about BALANCE. If the foie was 1/3 of the size, the meal might have been much better balanced, and I would be going back again and again for one of my favorite foods on earth: foie.\n\nSorry La Folie...can't give you more stars, but I'll keep coming back.", "author": "Yuchi C."}

Went for four courses because the waiter mentioned that the portions were decent sized (which they were). I was definitely stuffed by the end but it might have also been a combo of that and 2 bottles of wine (one of which was a white (Chardonnay?) that was French style ie not in oak barrels, but still made in napa).\n\nI got the pig trotters, which was delish . Very tender, meaty, and sinewy too. Very rich. I was pretty full after just eating this. \n\nI got the scallops for my second course, but it was just one scallop with some bacon / pig fat on the side. Wasn't a big fan of the pig fat, but the scallop was very good.\n\nThird course (and I was really full by then) was the rabbit made three ways. I got shaved truffles, which was an extra $10. I'm not sure if the truffles were worth it. One way was the just rabbit ribs, which was the best. Then there was tenderloin that was cut and stuffed with spinach and carrots. Forgot what the last way was but it was delicious and also stuffed with something. This was a good dish despite my only eating a little because I was so full.\n\nLast, I got the cheese souffl\u00e9 which was recommended, but I thought it was a little too heavy for desert though it was still lighter than expected. In retrospect, I should have gotten the chocolate bread pudding, which my co-eaters got and really liked.\n\nThere were 2 amuse bouches, a palate cleanser before desert, and a mini desert platter (I'm sure there's a name for it, but I don't know).\n\nMy co-eaters all got the risotto, which they liked but didn't rave about. The stuffed squab looked good and people liked. One person got the butter lobster and really liked it.\n\nVery expensive but food is very good.

Romantic, excellent food, attentive service, great overall experience. The meal won't be cheap but it is very reasonable compared to what you are getting in return. \n\nNot sure if I can call these negatives, but two notables are that they don't rush out with each course. They give you some time to chat between the courses before the next one comes out. So, go there with someone whose company you enjoy. Also, while there is a bit of a wait, it's not so long that you feel slighted or ignored. The space of time seems calculated to give you time to take in the last entree before trying the next. What I'm trying to say is, their heart is in the right place so leave em alone, yelpers. \n\nSecond notable, and this would not have occurred to me had I not been talking to my best friend who's French over the weekend, while the food is somewhat authentic, it's still caters to an american audience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-04", "description": "For full review see blog.\n\nAlready impressed by the trio of amuses and the service I was further wowed as my first dish emerged from the kitchen - Hudson Valley Foie Gras Torchon with Pineapple BBQ Squab, Kumquat Gastrique, Brioche, and Peanut Butter.  Too describe the myriad tastes, textures, and nuances of the dish would be nearly impossible, but suffice it to say that the picture is worth a thousand words.  The torchon, creamy and perfect - resting atop a crunchy peanut butter pate.  The squab, sweet and succulent and nestled in a bed of fresh pineapple accented greens.  The gastrique, nearly a warm compote and heavy with sweetness and citrus without being overpowering.  The brioche, buttery and slightly sweetened.  Mixed and matched the dish was nearly \"playing with your food\" as different combinations brought out different peaks and base-notes, all in all the best Foie preparation I've had outside of Yountville.\n\nStill basking in the memories of the foie approximately 20 minutes passed and I talked with the neighboring table for a bit before course two arrived - and arrive it did.  An item from the night's tasting menu, the Zuckerman Farm Asparagus and Duck Egg Tempura with Nueske Bacon, Wild Mushrooms, and Truffle Vinaigrette was without a doubt the most impressive egg dish I've had in San Francisco and quite possibly better than the famous truffle egg at The French Laundry or the mesmerizing Duck Egg I had at Charlie Trotter at New Years.  Flawlessly poached, the buttered asparagus was simple and undeniably wonderful while the egg was...::cue Homer Simpson drooling sound::  First poached, then flashed in a tempura batter and served alongside an earthy concoction of crispy and salty bacon with smooth and buttery mushrooms - like Bacon and Eggs yet exponentially more complex and intricate.  Crispy yet smooth, salty yet refined and earthy - probably the highlight of the meal and possibly the trip.\n\nDish three, a must order given my experience at TFL with the requested \"Peas and Carrots\", was Chef Passot's Butter Poached Lobster on English Sweet Pea Ravioli with Carrot and Almond Salad and Carrot Ginger Broth.  As you may have noted, there have been myriad comparisons to Keller's landmark in this review and this dish warrants yet another.  While not as refined or texturally complex as the sous vide option at The Laundry, the lobster itself was wonderful and balanced very well by the spicy ginger and carrot broth while the sweet pea ravioli was a single large entity that roused memories of Batali's sweet pea flan.  When a dish this good is the \"lowlight\" of the evening, you know you're eating well.\n\nBy dish four I was glad that I'd only had some celery and a protein shake on the plane because I was starting to feel a little full - at least until I took a bite and threw caution to the wind - with food this good I'd consider eating till I popped.  A signature dish of La Folie, the Roti of Quail and Squab Stuffed with Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, Natural Jus with Truffles and Quail Egg was as good as the reviews.  Cooked to medium rare each of the birds maintained their signature taste well without the slightest hint of \"gaminess\" while the potato strings added both taste and texture and the combination of jus and vegetables worked well.  Additionally attractive and tasty was the small quail egg served in a \"potato basket\" which the chef stated was intended to create a \"Easter like\" spring feel.\n\nFinishing up the savories and moving on to a much anticipated dessert I was once again visited by the chef who personally brought a palate cleanser to the table - a cleanser of parmesan cr\u00e8me gelato with hibiscus and pomegranate.  Sweet and smooth cream, tangy and tart pomegranate, plus the scent/palate sensation of flowers - very nice.\n\nFor dessert the decision was tough - quite frankly there wasn't a bad choice on the menu.  Finally settling on one I opted for the Strawberry Baked Alaska with Yuzu cake, Strawberry and Basil Icecream, Petite Millefeuille, and Basil Juice - a great choice, without a doubt.  Having experienced Basil/Strawberry/Yuzu in ice-cream form once prior at Eleven Madison Park in New York (Former Campton Place chef Daniel Humm) I had an idea of what to expect, but the version served at La Folie simply upped the stakes in every regard.  From the crunchy meringue shell to the airy and light strawberry and basil ice creams to the dense yuzu cake everything worked beautifully together and was additionally complimented by indelibly sweet strawberries accented with basil foam and a streak of strawberry gelee.  A great ending to a great meal.\n\nWhile not as \"innovative\" as others, I put the experience on par with any 5 star restaurant and found the cooking to be on par with that of even the famed French Laundry in many regards.  and I would never hesitate to recommend it to anyone as a GREAT meal at a fair price with superior service.", "author": "Michael U."}

Here's the play-by-play:\n\nEven though it's on Polk and everyone around the neighborhood is dressed SF-style, you really should dress at least business casual, like OpenTable suggests. Sure someone will screw it up and dress a little too casual, but unless you REALLY don't give a crap, you don't want to be that person. It's disrespectful.\n\nYou first walk in--everyone says hi to you. Everyone. Seating is prompt.\n\nWe got flat water. Later discovered you could get a choice. No biggie, but we did get wine, so....speaking of which, I'm in love with the Sancerre wine. Considering it's the 2nd to cheapest half-bottle you can get, I was surprised by how much I liked it--keep it chilled to prolong the magic of that first taste....that is, if you like sauvignon blanc.\n\nThey let us sub some stuff on the veggie tasting menu (it's 3-course, btw) with other veggie stuff on the regular menu.\n\nOur server was good about asking about allergies. I forgot I had food allergies, even though he asked me, and luckily Boyfriend piped in. Yeah, I'm the suck....Oh, but the service was great. It rivaled my experience @ Alexander Steakhouse. I do have to admit it was hilarious that we got asked 4x (by 4 different people) whether we needed a cab. A little overkill, but definitely appreciated.\n\nI really can't say anything bad about the food, nor can I describe it exactly. It's damn expensive for veggies, but MAN was it good. HOWEVER, it's not Ubuntu good, in my opinion, hence why it gets 4.75 stars. \n\nAnd if you've never had French food, don't freak that you have 2 carrot balls and one asparagus spear on your plate. If you don't get full off of the 3 course meal, you are either an elite athlete who must ingest 3000+ calories, you need to convince me your waistline isn't in the unhealthy range, or you need to add a course or two.\n\nSpecial props to the \"baby\" baked Alaskan. Wish i ordered it, but at least I got to try it from Boyfriend. (I had the dessert listed below it...forgot the name...was still good.)\n\nMeat notes: If they cook their meat as well as they do their veggies, hot damn you're in for a treat!\n\nEdited to add: Boyfriend's rankings, in terms of veggie 'cuz he's the one who's really why I get enough fiber nowadays--1) Ubuntu, 2) La Folie, 3) Millenium.

With one Michelin star and at this price point I expect much much better. We were seated promptly upon arrival and then ignored for 15 min after getting water. No one explained the menu or wine list until I asked, no bread until I asked. No one asked if it was a special occasion even though I specified it was for a birthday in my online reservation. The bathroom was disgusting, there was toilet paper and unidentified liquid all over the floor. The manager and chef stopped at several tables but never checked on us, not sure why but we were the only table of Asians in a place filled with white people.

Because I can get obsessive, it was inevitable that I would fill myself up with every type of foie gras they offered.  My first course - foie gras soup - was something I had never experienced before.  Amazing!  The flavor was immensely rich and paired ever so perfectly with the truffled cracker.  If you're not looking for foie gras overload, I would suggest sticking with just the soup.  I decided to go with the massively huge seared sonoma in addition to the soup.  I think our server thought I was nuts. It was a lot but I did it and it was GOOD!  In addition to the two, I nibbled on the foie gras torchon, which added a nice variety. My third course, the butter poached lobster, melted in my mouth and the combination with the squash ravioli was absolutely brilliant.  My main course - the beef tenderloin - was part of the winter tasting menu.  It was served with bernaise croquette and a bone marrow custard.  Oh wow!  Tender, flavorful, succulent, and coated the palate perfectly.  If the beef tenderloin is available, it is a must order.  My final course, the cheese souffle, came highly recommended from our server.  If you are a cheese fan, this is a must-try! Although very rich, it was delicious and a great way to end the meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of my courses!  I had the opportunity to try my bf's courses as well and while everything was very good, still didn't compare to my entrees.\n\nKudos go to our fabulous server Diane.  She was friendly, attentive, professional, and made the best recommendations.  She definitely gave that extra 'ooomph' to propel this place to a five star rating.  I will certainly be back.  I'm already thinking about the next special occasion where I'll be able to return. :)", "author": "Jess C."}

Foie gras was my appetizer, main course, and dessert.... and I did exercise hard after that night!\n\nWe came here back in March, and the menu was just filled with foie gras.  They said it's because of the ban that's coming up in March.  We were not complaining since that's one of the main reason we wanted to come.  Every dish was wonderful!  The meal was very filling. I think the foie gras dessert was a little bit too much for me.  I prefer something that's actually sweeter for dessert.  But to be honest, I was so full by the time dessert arrived that I couldn't really take another bite.  So, that might have skewed my taste buds.  :)\n\nService was very attentive.  To an extend, too attentive for my comfort... but not a huge problem.  One complaint that I did have was the fact that our table was not ready when we made a very late reservation at 9:30.  We were taken to their bar next door, which had nice decor.   We had to wait another 30 mins before our table was ready.  We just felt uncomfortable sitting there and not buying a drink.  But at the same time, we don't want to be force into feeling the need to buy a drink.  So, we just sat there for 30mins feeling like a waste of space and wishing we could start our meal already.", "author": "K W."}

Michelin Guide did not lead me astray.\n\nAfter being promptly seated (we were an early reservation due to last minute booking on our part) we were presented with the wine list and our menus.  We had the server suggest a red since we had brought a white.  They will waive the $40 corkage fee if you buy a bottle there, so I'd suggest bringing that special occasion bottle someone gifted to you a while back.\n\nMeal:\n\nAmuse bouche #1 - nectarine, light creme fraiche and garnish\nGood, light and refreshing, merely a start to an extraordinary meal.\n\nAmuse bouche #2 - coddled egg with a bisque and toasted brioche\nVery good. I normally don't love a poached egg but I'll be honest this was great and was presented beautifully with the soft chip and chive.\n\nSoup - corn soup with crispy sweetbreads and zucchini blossom stuffed with lobster mouse\nThis is a sweet soup again presented beautifully. Be prepared for it to actually be a sweet soup.  I wouldn't have really been upset if the sweetbreads weren't included as they seemed to take a back seat to everything else but the blossoms were outstanding and packed with flavor.\n\nAppetizer - Scallop Ceviche, Kampachi Sashimi, and Kusshi Oyster\nThe real treat to this dish is the infused trout row on each item. Each portion has a differently infused roe, all of which I can't remember but were clearly distinct in adding to the flavor.  Definitely a smaller app but that shouldn't be a concern as you will leave full no matter what you order.\n\nFish - lobster risotto with mushroom\nFully enjoyable, probably would have gone a different route after seeing some of the other dishes.\n\nPoultry - squab and quail roti\nAmazing, every aspect was amazing. Perfectly cooked, exquisitely presented, tasted like it looked. Egg in a basket was just a nice touch to an already great plate.\n\nIntermezzo - chilled melon soup with blackberry\nLight, definitely cleanses the pallet and I could have eaten a bowl of this. \n\nDessert - chocolate fondant cake\nAlready stuffed this pushed me over the top but it was worth it.  Light, chocolately, melty, all the things you want and expect in a lava cake.\n\n\n5 stars for presentation, service, and quality of the food. Nothing is lacking and they make that abundantly clear. The 5 course menu at $100 a head didn't leave me feeling like I had paid too much, completely worth it. Definitely get 5 courses, abstaining from one or two would be an injustice to yourself.", "author": "ZRap R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-06-26", "description": "This review is based on the foie gras tasting menu (6/25/2012) with 5 courses of foie gras.\n\nFirst, two amuse bouches, one was a foie gras paste with fruit and the other was an egg soup with a rectangular prism of brioche and a potato chip. The paste with fruit tasted too heavy for an amuse-bouche yet didn't have the flavor complexity that I would expect. The soup was okay, though the yolk was overcooked.\n\nThe first course was a seared piece of foie gras with a foie gras soup. The presentation of the seared foie gras was terrible, with the fat/grease slopping around the plate. The foie gras soup was a frothy mixture of foam and a broth that had a gritty texture. The soup tasted very similar to the seared foie gras. Both parts were extremely rich but lacked differentiation in flavor.\n\nThe second course featured a large slice of traditionally prepared foie gras on top of a \"peanut butter powerbar\" (as described by our waiter) with a small brioche, some squab, and a strawberry compote. This was a pretty good dish, though not particularly harmonious. The \"powerbar\" sweetness didn't really go with the squab or the compote, but experimentation revealed decent combinations of foie gras with the accompanying pieces.\n\nThe third course was a scallop on a potato, topped with a piece of seared foie gras with a piece of asparagus. Alarmingly, the foie gras was prepared identically to the first course, seared and relatively large. Again, the grease and fat was all over the plate, The scallop and potato were actually quite good and the asparagus was tender. The seared foie gras, however, remained uninteresting but over-rich and overly generous, almost overpowering the other components when eaten together.\n\nThe fourth course was a piece of filet mignon topped with an identically prepared piece of seared foie gras, topped with generous shavings of black truffles and accompanied by various carrots and roots. The serving size here was massive and reminded me more of a steakhouse rather than a French restaurant. Between the foie gras and the filet, there was easily 8 ounces of meat on the plate. The foie gras was again overpoweringly rich, though the steak alone was quite good with the truffles. I can't help but thinking that the truffles are misused here as they would go along far better with any pasta rather than a cut of tenderloin. I didn't end up finishing this course because I could not eat 3 pieces of identically prepared pieces of seared foie gras within four courses. \n\nDessert was a foie gras mousse on top of a chocolate mouse, with a topping of raspberry glaze and a side of bacon ice cream and a side of hazelnut sponge cake. The bacon ice cream was pretty good but didn't really go with the mousse.\n\nWine pairings for the evening featured a Conundrum blend of proprietary whites from Napa, a Sauternes, a pinot noir, a merlot blend, and a 10-year port. The pinot and merlot were well-paired and did a lot to cut through the richness of the foie gras. The Sauternes lacked complexity.\n\nTo be fair, this dinner was labeled 'au revoir foie gras' and after the dinner, I had quite enough of the ingredient. If you're looking for a good foie gras tasting menu, Txoko in North Beach is far better (certainly more imaginative). Their bartender also makes a better French 75.\n\nIn conclusion, two stars. The second star is for the relatively good service provided by the staff. Given the flaws in presentation (grease dripping all over the plate) and the lack of imagination in foie gras preparation (3/5 coures were identically seared foie gras), I can't imagine this place will ever get a second Michelin Star; it's a wonder how it got its first.", "author": "Ray H."}

I went with a 5-course meal.\n\n1st Course: Foie Gras Soup - I had initially thought it was just the soup, which I was fine with.  Instead, it was the soup along with a filet of grilled foie gras.  I was like \"Whaattt so amazing!\"\n2nd Course: Tasting of Passot Roe - It was a trio of raw fish and shellfish, including oyster, scallop, and yellowtail.  Out of the three, I enjoyed the yellowtail.\n3rd Course: Lobster and Mushroom Risotto - At this point, I was worried that I was over my head with the number of courses selected.  Fortunately, the course was smaller than I had originally expected.  Unfortunately though, this dish did not seem like a risotto, more like soup.  Probably the weakest of the five.\n4th Course:  Lamb Rack - This course was definitely fulfilling.  I got two racks and both were pretty delicious.  Enough said.\n5th Course:  Cheese Souffle - I definitely enjoyed the contrast between the cheese and the sorbet, as odd as it seems.  The bacon felt comical, and was a nice touch to end the service.\n\nWe also had a couple of amuse bouches and refreshers throughout the evening,  and they were all great in prepping us between courses.  The service was also extraordinary, as he was friendly and answered all of our questions.  We were fortunate to be placed in the quiet section of the restaurant, which was intimate and nice.  Even the head chef came out to greet us, which was pretty cool.\n\nOverall, I think this place was just too awesome.

Although food is still memorable, and value is still there due to larger portions and better ingredients puts it slightly ahead of peers in same group.

Highlights: foie gras is huge (and no it's never too big) and cooked perfectly, huckleberry sauce a little underwhelming. Stuff quail has cooked perfectly with crispy wrapped potatoe. Amuse bouche were all delightful surpises; in fact more raves at table for them than the actual dishes. \n\nLows: some dishes could have salted a little better. Butter poach lobster was messy dish and too busy; more of a salad with way too much frisces salad.\n\nSadly I will have to search for my next 5star fine dining establishment to replace this is one.

As I said the food was lovely but we both recalled much more exciting flavors and more of a \"special\" feel at FDL.  \nThere were some stand out dishes - the Foie Gras Soup on the tasting menu was out of this world and nothing like I've experienced before and the Tempura Duck Egg on Sweetbread Pancake was truly very special.  However, some of the food was difficult to eat because of how it was prepared and presented - the seared foie gras, which by the way was the largest portion I have ever received in my life, was in a bowl that my utensils kept sliding in to and getting dipped in the apple consomme and the poached apple was a bit too hard; the butter poached lobster tail in the risotto was pulled out of the shell but not fully disconnected and I almost had to use my fingers to pull it off. \nThey have a lounge/bar area next door (which you should check out!) with a small dining room that connects the two spaces but they didn't do a good job at soundproofing.  When the mega-million lotto numbers were drawn the yelling and screaming sounded like they were in the same room with us!  In the dining room people were texting, talking on their cell phones and taking pictures and posting during dinner and the service staff never asked them to stop or step outside.

The dinner menu format is similar to Gary Danko's pick 3, 4, or 5 course dinners for 75, 85, 95 respectively...\n\nwe got greedy so each of us had the 4 course and we only got 1 dessert to share...\n\nwe heeded the recommendations for our lovely server and between the two of us we got:\n\nsweet corn soup with chantrelle mushrooms, sweetbread, lobster\nfoie gras\nlobster x2\ntrio of rabbit three ways\nrack of lamb\nwarm pigs feet, sweetbreads terrine \nchocolate fondant dessert \n\nI had high hopes for the sweetcorn soup, but that being the first course it was just way too rich for me. The corn soup was a very thick  very rich soup base wiht a piece of lobster, sweetbread and himeji mushroom in it. The soup was lovely, but just way to rich as a starter. The sweetbread was deep fried and a bit hard for my taste, it wasnt as light and fluffy as it should be at other places I've had. The piece of lobster was a part of the lobster claw-just fine.\n\n2nd course was the much anticipated foie gras. There was a $10 supplement for this which was fine for me, I always eat foie gras when we go out for a special occasion, and definetely at a french restaurant! Well this foie gras was tasty, with a hucklberry and maple syrup reduction. BUT the foie gras was the size of my palm, or the equivalent to a large filet mignon! It was so thick and so big, that it was just so hard to finish. It definetely is enough for 2 if not 3. I didnt think that I would ever complain about recieving TOO much foie gras, but this was over kill. I wish they would have porportioned this better, along with all the other dishes. \n\nthe warm pigs feet and sweetbreads terrine was good, but my BF didnt realize it was a terrine which he doesnt really enjoy, but he said it was OK. He'd probably rather try the frogs legs or the escargot. Nothing to write home about here, tasty but not mindblowing.\n\nThe next course was the lobster which we both got and was good, light, refreshing after the ginormous foie gras and corn soup.\n\nLastly, both the trio of rabbit and the lamb were cooked to perfection. The rabbit (teeny little rack of rabbit) was so cute and SO tasty! I wish they could just give us a place full of those. The lamb was cooked perfectly and very well seasoned, but had a bit too much fat around the actual meat so there was barely any meat to be had, but by then we were so full from the overly rich courses we were OK with this.\n\nLastly, the chocolate fondant, like a warm chocolate lava cake, was good but not mindblowingly good. Best dessert is still the warm chocolate bread pudding crossaint at chaya brasserie.\n\nTotal with tip $$235 w/o any wine or beverages. \n\nOverall, a good evening, good service, good ambience, but I just wished that they made the porportions a bit better to go cater to the overall meal. I stil think Gary Danko is still the best, with every bite better than the last. We were completely stuffed but then about 2 hours later at the hotel we felt like we were still lacking something but just that we ate waay to rich of a dinner. Hard to explain, but I dont think I would frequent this joint again...there are too many other places to try like jardinere, or michael minas.\n\nAlso in between courses they gave us a amuse bouche- a light cantelope cold soup and some sort of egg yolk steamed with creme, that was pretty rich too!", "author": "Petri Y."}

I came here for Valentine's Day dinner last night.\n\nThe hostess told us there was valet parking available, which ended up coming in handy after 30 minutes of circling Russian Hill on a Saturday night. Do yourself a favor and just get it valeted for $15. I didn't know that you could add it to your tab. The parking attendant made my BF go to the ATM and get cash.\n\nNow onto the food options. There's a tasting menu for $110 on the left, and 3 options for course dinners ranging from $80, $90, $100 for 3-4-5 courses, respectively. Although it's tempting to just get 5 courses for $100, for only $20 more, I got the 3 course, and my bf got the 4 course. The cool thing about ordering your own courses, is that you can pick out of whatever categories you want -- soup/salad, appetizer, seafood/fish, meat/poultry, and dessert. So you don't have to get a dessert and can go for a fish and meat (two entrees). Pretty cool. So in addition to ordering my 3 plates, and his 4 plates, they also offer you a palette cleanser, and a delicious egg yolk/cream coup in an egg shell.\n\nThe low down:\nCauliflower soup w/ lobster - I just have a thing for creamy soup, so this was simple and just what I expected\nSeared fois gras (pay +10 supplement) -- get this if you LOVE fois gras. It comes in a huge huge portion, so make sure you're able to finish it!\nBlack cod -- the skin is so very crispy, aligns well with the tender fish. comes with gnocci and white beans.\nLobster -- nice and buttery. Also comes on homemade ravioli.\nLamp chop & loin -- too full to eat this, we boxed it up! The few bites I had were tasty.\nSquab -- too full to eat this\nCarrot cake w/ vanilla creme brulee - too full to eat this\n\nThe best thing about La Folie is that everything comes out piping HOT, which is nice and makes all the difference in food.\n\nSince our 3rd meat course was running late, they offered a smoked salmon \"lollipop\" on the house. This made is stuffed to the point that we could barely even touch our 3rd course when it came out. We ended up boxing that up, along with my bf's 4th course dessert. It was just so much food -- make sure you starve yourself on that day or just opt for the minimum 3 courses, and share plates. Remember you can pretty much pick and choose what you want, so get a variety of things and course types.\n\nThe total, with a glass of wine and scotch came out to be around $230 before tax and tip. Definitely the most expensive meal we've eaten to date on our dime. I only wish I'd been hungrier! We're eating our meat courses for leftover dinner tonight so I can comment on that later!", "author": "Jeanne C."}

But lemme tell you he's fantastic!) The presentation is out of this world; gorgeous artfully crafted creations are displayed before you for each course.\n\nSecond, the service is impeccable. They make you feel like it's OK to be just as incredibly indulgent as you want to be. To me, some fine dining establishments feel so stuffy that it's almost unenjoyable-- La Folie isn't like this. So yeah, it's a little hushed, a teeny tiny bit 'hoity-toity' but come on, that's to be expected. \n\nThe staff is just as nice as can be and remarkably accomodating. Not a wine connoisseur? Hey, no problem. The Maitre d' will help you out. Undecided about an item? Waiter is there in a second. In fact, if you're really bad about making decisions, just let 'em know and they'll go with it! And I guarantee, you'll like... no, you'll LOVE everything you put in your mouth.\n\nLa Folie literally translates into \"madness,\" which explains the jesters and the tactful, elegant \"drama\" theme throughout the restaurant. One thing I recommend is to sit in the front dining room. It seems there's more \"action\", the lights are dimmer, it just has a nicer \"romantic\" atmosphere than the back private room, which seems a bit more \"stuffy\".\n\nI can't say enough about this place, it really is a gem.

Simply put, La Folie delivers exceptional French cuisine with a California twist. Portions are generous, so the smallest three course menu will have more than enough food. The details in the presentation were just superb- carrots cut into tiny balls to resemble the peas they were paired with, a small 'basket' made of fried potato strings and a quail egg. And the food itself was delightful- rich, decadent, indulgent, and playful. A foie gras terrine, for example, was paired with a crunchy peanut butter concoction and a mini-brioche.\n\nService from the entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.

It's the only way I order, because they see everything that is happening in the kitchen at any given moment where the food is concerned.\n\nFor our first course, \nHe had a  terrine of Hammachi and Tuna layered into a slice of Bliss.\nI had a huge Scallop on the softest leeks with a sauce from Heaven.\n\nWe split the second course which was the Fois Gois by their suggestion because it's very large, huge actually. Absolutely perfect.\n\nFor our third course ,\nHe had the Lamb with a reduction that was mouth watering .\nI had a Beef Tenderloin that I must say was not like any I have ever had. It was light and airy if meat could actually be that. Chef Roland said it was a Niman Ranch filet. Just Amazing .\n\nWe actually didn't have room for the cheese so we took it home along with the chocolates they sent to my table with a candle.\n\nAs for Libation , We started with two glasses of Champagne and had two glasses each of red wine throughout the dinner. \nI had two French Beaujolais and he had two Pinot Noir and we shared and shared !\n\nMy friend Kristen is the Sommelier and she is most sensitive to your tastes and so professional. Not to mention very pretty and speaks French.. tres chic  .\n\nWe asked to meet the owner and Chef Roland gladly came from the kitchen to introduce himself , was very gracious and he signed a birthday card along with the staff. They delivered it with dessert. BTW, When a chef takes the time to do this I know this is a quality restaurant.\n \nI can't believe I waited this long to try La Folie and I definitely can't wait to return for another decadent dinner .", "author": "Katherine N."}

The service was excellent, the atmosphere lovely and the accommodating menu a welcome surprise. But I have to tell you, the food itself didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nSome dishes were huge hits, and others were misses. For example, the lobster and mushroom risotto, especially with fresh black truffles added, was on fire. But the \"house specialty\" foie gras with glazed pineapple was really disappointing. A giant seared steak of foie gras on top of a cooked pineapple just isn't very tasty to my tummy, as it turns out. \n\nQuail and squab, two meats I would never traditionally order, were pretty tasty. But my husband's fish (dourade) was only okay. \n\nSo, after waiting for years to come here, how does it measure up next to similar restaurants (say, Fleur de Lys, Masa's, Gary Danko, Chez Spencer)? Honestly, I'd move it towards the back of those.\n\nPlease bear in mind, I'm being a harsh critic just pitting it against those top restaurants.

I would not go out of my way to come here again. \n\nWhy? You might ask? \n\n1) Service at the bar was not very good, I ordered a glass the bartender disappeared, since I was with friends I decided to lounge with them and wait to be served. An entire hour went by while I was chatting in the lounge before any wait staff asked me about a drink \n\n2) The crowd is random, more Asian cougars then I have seen in a while (funny coming from me since I turn 30 this year and I'm part Asian) and a fair amount of French men (go figure it's La Folie). \n\n3) Overpriced mediocre wines by the glass, there was one red wine that was $9 by the glass, all other reds were $14 - 16 a glass. Those are St. Regis lounge prices people - and you're not the St. Regis lounge. \n\nThe one bathroom for this upscale place is a bit of an issue, especially because there were 80% more women. \n\nOK, other then that I might have my arm twisted to grace them with my presence.

(Note: 1 star is really, really good.)\r\n\r\nService: Impeccable. Just the right blend of friendliness and formality, which they certainly tune to the vibe of each table. Perfect delivery. The sommelier was exceedingly helpful in customizing pairings for our ad-hoc courses, including opening up an off-menu Burgundy just for one pour. (It had a compromised label, so don't expect that every time...)\r\n\r\nAtmosphere: Muted, modern, a little conservative.\r\n\r\nFood: Creative and generally incredible, with a couple blemishes. As you would expect, most of the dishes showcased tremendous complexity of flavor and sophistication of preparation. My crab Napoleon, for example, was constructed of layers of thin dried pineapple sandwiching hints of Dungeness crab and greens sitting on a gelatin base with mango accents. It tasted like a breath of fresh air. The John Dory had a \"fake\" mushroom skin which complimented it perfectly. Lots of great sauces.\r\n\r\nHowever, this requires tremendous skill and attention to pull off well, and they missed a few marks. For one, our duck was undercooked. I don't mean \"I'm used to everything done midwest medium\" undercooked, I mean straight-up chewy and inedible in some places undercooked. A fluke, perhaps, but our fluke.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I think it is fair to say that our courses tended to lean toward the pizazz and novelty of flavor combinations more than letting the main ingredient shine through. For example, you could hardly notice that the duck was undercooked until you realized you've been chewing on it for half a minute -- there were so many other flavors going on in the dish competing for your attention. Asparagus, a great test of a chef's skill, was a bit dominated by cream in the soup and completely overpowered by shrimp in its accompanying cracker. But I can't fault this too much, as for the most part the melange of flavors was a total success.\r\n\r\nValue: After wines and tip and parking and such, you're probably looking at $125-$200+ pp. At this range, you expect perfection in the food at least, if not the other categories. La Folie doesn't quite deliver that, but it's within striking distance. A fine experience for our 3rd wedding anniversary.", "author": "Tom L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-11", "description": "I was brought here about a month ago for a B-day dinner and it was quite a surprise.  This place is very nice and fancy.  I am really not a fancy dining type of person though.  I will go to places like this often enough but I'm not going to put on a suite and tie just to eat dinner.  This place was full of people old and young that were dress up for the eating occasion.  This is clearly a place that you would go to celebrate an anniversary, B-day, 1st date, impress a new client, impress a girl/guy, or anyone else.  I am not from SF and I did not pack a tie so I was dressed down a bit, but I'd do that anywhere I guess. \n\nI will start with the wine selection process.  I don't know a great deal about wine and in this case we had questions about a few of the bottles since we'd never heard of them nor had them.  They send over the sommelier and we get educated.  This was the 1st time I've been Sommelier'd in a restaurant.  Woot!\n\nI was told that this place had some great food and some good meat dishes.  It sure did, however... it was all outdone by the appetizer.  They have a menu that you basically order an appetizer-main-dessert and they will bring them out one at a time.  I noticed escargot on the menu as an appetizer so I ordered that.  I'm a fan of snails...so yeah.  Now...here is where it gets epic.  The dish comes out and all I see is a bone in some green sauce.  I look at it and think...Wow bone marrow!  I didn't even see that on the menu but I am glad they messed up and brought this because I would have ordered this over the snails.  The nice thing about this place is they go ahead and tell you all about the dish you are about to eat.  (My mind is about to be blown in 3....2.....1)   He says the Escargot is inside and mixed with the Marrow!!!!!!!!   OH MY GOD!!!!!!!   EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!   This is the greatest dish I have ever had.  I can't believe this.  I was in French Food Heaven.  \n\nSo after the bread and after the appetizer, the Chef sends out a Free Dish that he just decided to make for everyone.  It was very good, and I wish I could remember what it was.  The main course comes out and everyone eats and then on to the dessert.  Each dish was accompanied by an explanation and wonderful  presentation and service.  Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  \n\nThe cherry on top of the whole experience....The Chef comes out to the table and asks how we liked the food.  This was so nice, because I wanted to ask the waiter to relay a message to him about how awesome the food was.\n\nI will definitely come back her each time I visit SF!", "author": "Scott D."}

I'm sure nostalgia plays into it a bit but i hope you get what i mean... service was impeccable but there were a few snafus which i'll go over later...\n\nThe food:\n\nFor apps we had the seared Hudson Valley foie gras, foie gras torchon, frog legs \"Bernard Loiseau\"  and warm pigs feet terrine. I thought the seared foie was amazing but i've yet to try it at Gary Danko or Michael Mina for comparison... The torchon was delicious but serving size was too much?... its body and flavor is more akin to something like a pate so would have been better as a spread? to it's credit, the torchon was served with a succlent piece of squab and a chutney that the foie did go well with... the fried frog legs were my wife's fav of the app and my fav was the pigs feet terrine... if youve had frogs legs and like them in general, youll like this preperation... the pigs feet was dreamy, tender pulled meat wrapped in fatty pork skin... melt in your mouth delicious.. if you have any aversion to sweetbread, dont sweat it, you wont even notice it. \n\nOur amuse bouche items included a salmon lollipop, a tuna tartare, and a quail egg. The salmon lollipop was too \"fishy\" for both our palates, i believe it had to do more with freshness than preparation...  \n\nOur mains were the butter poached lobster, lobster risotto, trio of rabbit and \"Le Boeuf\" (which was a trio of beef, lol). Both lobster dishes were good but the butter poached lobster really showcased the skill of the chef, perfect is all i can really say. The trio of rabbit was a bit on the salty side especially the braised leg but the stuffed loins were really really good, flavor, tenderness, texture... and stuffed with what you ask? in the words of our waiter, \"all the things that rabbits eat!\"\nThe beef trio was a letdown of sorts... the mini beef burger with truffles was fantastic! Medium rare, tender and just the right amount of truffle coming through... not overpowering at all as truffles can be. The slice of short rib was also delicious... perfectly braised, melt in your mouth tender... but the filet, the filet... overcooked beyond comprehension...\n\nto be honest by this point in the meal, we were struggling to finish so we didnt make a big deal of it but i did let our waiter know since the kitchen of such an establishment should be informed of such an obvious lack of care. He agreed with us and offered to replace it but we declined since we were getting full...\n\nWe completed our meal by sharing a dessert, a vanilla creme brulee served on carrot cake atop a gingersnap with a side of earl grey ice cream. My wife and i both believe that the earl grey ice cream stole the show. \n\nThe service: \n\nAforementioned snafus include serving us an order of seared foie gras that we did not order and serving the filet mignon well done. Otherwise service was excellent and small talk with our waiter entertaining. He did correct the mistakes on the bill by comping the foie gras and the beef trio. We expected the comp of the foie but not for the beef since we did enjoy 2/3rds of the trio but he insisted and we appreciated his good will. The table boy even apologized for not filling my water glass quickly enough... its the little things that really make a good restaurant shine.\n\nHonestly, a restaurant of La Folie's standing should not be making these kind of mistakes... whether by the waiter or the kitchen but they did make up for it as best they could. \n\nAnd when the food was good, it was very good. So im feeling generous today with 4 stars.\n\nThe pig's feet terrine and butter poached lobster are highly recommended.", "author": "Denny C."}

La Folie has the best host and wait staff. Very polite and accommodating. The food at La Folie, I will have to say this is one of the best meals I had in my life. First off, their service. The service was nice. I like it when the waiters/waitresses come every once and a while to check up on you but its not too much that it start getting annoying. Second the amuse-bouche are complimentary. I don't know if was for that one night but it was a nice little touch. Third the food... The food was perfectly cooked. I had the quail and squab and usually with squab its either too cooked or too undercooked, but this one was just perfect. My husband had the Kobe beef and he loved it. Now in my husband vocabulary, when he say something is fine that means its good. When he something is good then he means its excellent. But when I asked him how his food was, he it was excellent, which he's only said that once and the  last time he said that about the food at our wedding. So that's up there. The dessert we had with it was so delicious! I had the chocolate ganache and it was so good that I didn't want to share it. And finally, before we had all our tasty food and desserts, we ordered caviar. Now I've had caviar before and I love it but this was my husbands first time eating it. He doesn't normally like anything that comes from water, only shrimp. So when he had this he really liked it. With the caviar they had bellini stuffed with corn and creme fraiche over it. The combination with the corn was unbelievable. \n\nSo again if you have the money, eat here. If you don't it's okay to splurge on good food every once and a while.

There I was, dressed up with my handsome date -- and this old bag was laying into me, for quite a while.  Rule #1 - Don't scold your customers?  At that point I should have followed my instinct to leave -- but I didn't want to be difficult... The nightmare continued with a condescending waitress, who kept asking us \"Are we enjoying ourselves?\" in a haughty fake accent.  We quickly formed a bond with the the one person who was nice -- the bread girl.  The experience was so bad, it was almost funny.  \n\nA friend wanted to take me here recently -- and I told him what I'm telling you.  The food is unimpressive and the service is beyond horrible.

Sadly, the only way to have foie gras now is to bring your own and the chef will cook for you. They are not following Chicago lead (where the ban was eventually reversed - smart) and serve if you ask off the menu. C'est la vie.\n\nI love compliments from the chef, plenty, more than what you receive in a fancy French place in France.\n\nVery attentive waiter (forgot the name, American gentleman who worked there over 5 years) who overheard me saying \" it;s your bday, you pick\" and organize small birthday sweet plate without me ask.

Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by that type of culinary freedom, but not at La Folie.  Our waiter helped guide some decisions and I ended up with: the corn soup with lobster meat and cripsy sweetbreads, a fish dish, the details of which are now totally escaping me (due solely to sleep deprivation resulting from the aforementioned work hell and not in any way attributable to quality or intrigue of said dish), and the quail stuffed with mushrooms and wrapped in cripsy potato strings.\n\nAt the risk of venturing into that slippery slope of culinary hyperbole, I have to say that every bite was perfection--the flavors were unique, thoughtful, and delectable.  \n\nLa Folie is the type of place where the sometimes-squeamish should feel free to order with abandon, safe in the knowledge that you cannot go wrong with this menu.  Crunchy sweetbreads?  Why not.  Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine?  Don't mind if I do (next time).\n\nOur service was excellent and, for what it was (in our case: 3 courses each and a bottle of Chateneuf de Pape), I found the bill very reasonable.\nI had the occasion to dine back-to-back at La Folie and Gary Danko (see my Danko review) and there's no question in my mind that La Folie serves up a better overall dining experience.", "author": "Auburn D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-21", "description": "My review is based solely on my Valentines Day experience here, which may or may not reflect this place as a whole.  In summary, good food, nice service, but I felt a bit rushed in the Valentines Day traffic so that may have affected my experience as a whole here.\n\nWhen I first walked in to the restaurant, I was excited to see that this place had a very warm ambience... but then we were lead to a back room that was less well lit and a little drab in comparision.  It's all relative, right?  Maybe I just wasn't a fan of the lighting in the back room.\n\nBut anyways onward to the food!\n\nFirst Blush - Kushi Oysters (with Compressed Apple, Horseradish Cream, Apple-Champagne Gelee): served on a Asian style spoon, and quite delicious.  The pairing of the Oysters with the horseradish and gelee and slurping it all in in one bite was a very pleasant experience.\n\nFiltre D'Amour - Parsnip Soup: This soup was the bomb, and was actually the highlight of the whole meal.  Super creamy and flavorful, with the parsnip flavor sneaking through the creaminess.  The crispy sweet bread served on a stick was a great pairing with the soup, and the truffle beignets was paired perfectly with a creamy sauce served on the side of the soup.  \n\nLove Connection: Choice between the following:\n1) Terrine of Two Salmons, Scallop, Lobster and Aritchoke (Pickled Cucumbers and Duck Egg Sauce - I wanted to like this dish, but I really didn't :(.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of terrines, because the ingredients were all individually good... the lobster was sweet, the scallop was fresh.  However, the cold plate of everything combined into a big... jello... or sorts, simply did not blow me away.  I had to struggle to finish the dish only because I knew it was expensive :p.  In short this one didn't pass the taste test for me and sent the dining experience to a slight dip.\n2) Lobster and Mushroom Risotto - THIS, on the other hand, was delicious (stole a few bites from my boyfriend).  I regret not going with my first instincts to order this dish considering my love for lobster bisque.  The risotto was super flavorful from the lobster broth and leeks, and the risotto texture was creamy and smooth.  GAH!  Should've gone with this dish lol.\n\nLa Passion:  Choice between the following:\n1) Beef Trio: Creekstone Beef Tenderloin, Braised Beef Short Rib, and Burger Rossine with Sauce Bordelaise - great meat, cooked to perfection.  Too bad the dinner reservation was at 4:45pm so by the time this dish came out, I was already pretty full (since I wasn't really hungry to begin with).  It's a shame I couldn't do this dish justice, but the tenderloin was tender, and the short rib fell apart when I stuck a fork in.  The mini burger had a hint of rosemary taste but didn't blow me away.  But as a testament to the tenderloin, it stayed delicious and tender a few days later when it was reheated :) (I had to doggy bag this one... this was a big dish)\n2) Slow Cooked Butterfish - soft and buttery as expected from a \"butter\"fish.  It was good but this didn't blow me away either.\n\nLe Desir\n1) Molten Valhrona Chocolate Bread Pudding, Passing Fruit Sabayon Raspberry Sorbet - this dish was the saving grace of the meal as a whole because by this point I was feeling rushed and a tad disappointed with the 2 main dishes.  This is probably the best bread pudding I've ever had, with the texture and taste borderlining that of a souffle.  The chocolate was perfectly sweet and paired perfectly with the raspberry sorbet.  Simply delicious.\n\nOverall, for $155 a person, I'd recommend you to take the hike up to Healdsburg and go for Cyrus instead (Cyrus is $109 a person for their 5 course menu).   Maybe it was because it was Valentines day, but the pace of the meal was a bit noticeably rushed and not very natural, but I don't think that should be an excuse for fine dining.  Or maybe they just need to change the lighting in that back room...", "author": "Angela H."}

The food was divine, and the portions were huge!! They also gave us four amuse bouche! Even the last one, the chocolate, we ALL had four pieces to try. Normally, I have to split them or share, but not this time!\n\nI ordered: \n\nThe Warm Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine on a Lentil Salad\nwith Bacon, Hazelnut Vinaigrette -- HUGE, and tasty. The outer layer was crispy, but the inside just melted in your mouth. The tartness of the lentil salad with the vinaigrette balanced the heaviness of the meat.\n\nR\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab stuffed with Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, and Natural Jus with Truffles - this was HUGE and delicious. I couldn't finish it, but it was really good. The meat was really soft and flavorful and went really well with the crispy potato strings. You can really taste the truffles too! The presentation was also great. There was even a little potato basket with an egg!\n\nWarm Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9 with Fromage Blanc Sorbet, Crispy Bacon, White Sesame Tuileet  -- very unique dessert. It wasn't my favorite, but good nonetheless. I really liked my friend's chocolate fondant. I would recommend the chocolate fondant over the cheese souffle.\n\nThe presentation of the food was beautiful. The ambiance was perfect. We basically had our own private room, with some couples around us. Sorry couples! I'm sure we ruined their romantic dinner with snippets like: \"my parents chased me with a bamboo stick!\" (we're Asian!)\n\nThe service was also superb.

This was back in the day before the new decor when the theme was more whimsical and \"circus-like\".  It was a fixed-price menu that night (about one-hundred bucks per person) because of the romantic holiday.  The single option on the menu was whether you wanted some truffle shaved into your risotto for an extra fifty bucks per person.\nI never get sick of telling this story:  So I'm in a good mood and trying to impress the soon to be wifey and decide to splurge for the truffle option.  After our risotto comes, our waiter comes by with \"a rare Italian white truffle\" to shave into it.  He whips out the mini blade with a showman's flair and... I kid you not... shaves three measly, super-thin slices of truffle into each risotto dish.  The slices were so thin, I could see through them!  Fifty bucks!!\n\nAfter that experience, I swore never to return.\n\nWell 3 years later, wifey and I reluctantly come back to La Folie.  We only agree to return because our work has agreed to foot the bill (we can never say no to free food).  We're amazed by the changes.  The decor seems more upscale and fitting, the food is MUCH more interesting and our waiter didn't try to con us with that damn truffle!\n\nPrices are steep, but no worse than the competition.

My husband and I needed a night out so after serious research my husband picked La Folie.  I read the reviews in the car on our way to the restaurant and was a bit worried as I saw a few about rude service.  However, from the moment we stepped through the doors to the second we walked out, we had nothing but awesome experience.  The menu is pretty simple, pick 3-5 course meal from different sections just don't double up on meat.  If you want shaved truffles they are $40 additional (not $10 as someone had recently posted) and if you would like to upgrade your steak to Wagyu beef its additional $60 on top of the $80-100 meal.  Plus the wine and coffee, and if you like Foie Gras, you'll pay and extra $10 - don't expect your bill to be less than $300, yet, the overall experience is worth it.\n\nThe food was prepared exceptionally good! Everything arrived at proper temperatures at proper times, well seasoned and presented very nicely.  The portions are not all that big, but since you are having a multiple course meal, you won't leave hungry.  In addition the chef sends out a few taster bites - an amuse bouche, a squash soup in an egg shell and a sample of petit four at the end of your meal. The Foie Gras is bigger than in some other places, but I wouldn't call it huge - its about a 3.5\" round by 1.5\" tall piece - nicely seared and served in cinnamon apple consomm\u00e9.  The rack of lamb course is huge - you get two pieces and it is enough to share.   I had poached lobster, and it was quite good.

I think that is probably the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  I had ordered a half bottle of Champagne, and that and the Champagne was the most perfect pairing.  But it was RICH of course.  After that, I knew I was going to be pretty much done.  \nThird was the pan seared daurade in a sea urchin broth.

Naturally, we had to boast about the City and everything it has to offer. It's only fair, then, that we chose a restaurant that is not only popular in San Francisco, but garners reviews with such a wide reach -- Zagat, CitySearch, The New York Times, and so on.\n\nSuffice it to say, La Folie represented the City well, and it left a lasting impression on our weekend visitor. The ambiance, decor, service and dining menu were divine!\n\nWe all ordered a 4-course menu, but with the amuse bouche, petit fours and an array of \"extras,\" our dining experience was more like a 7-course epicurean bonanza!\n\nI enjoyed the pig feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine (unbelievable!), halibut (scrumptious), squab (mmmm...), and the lamb (savory).\n\nThe latter dishes were customary for high-end French restaurants, but the sweetbread and lobster terrine was quite possibly the best appetizer I've ever had. It's a one-of-a-kind specialty that you cannot have the pleasure of savoring anywhere else. It's that good.\n\nMy drinks included a sidecar made to perfection by the bartender, a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon to complement the lamb, and a few drinks called \"La Folie Old Fashioned\" made the night an absolute delight.\n\nI won't even touch on the dessert. OK, fine. The pastry chef was masterful in producing the sweetest and most delectable chocolate fondant. \n\nI can still taste it. Absolutely heavenly. \n\nI usually skip out on dessert, but with everything so extraordinary, I had to indulge a bit. I was not disappointed, to say the least.\n\nSo to summarize: an unforgettable collection of well-presented dishes, coupled with a sensational drink menu, and flanked by an ultra-professional staff makes for an unparalleled dining experience.\n\nAnd at about $160 per person -- when it was all said and done -- it was all still very worth the price of admission.", "author": "Phil D."}

Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted and someone offered to take my coat.  While waiting, I looked around the restaurant.  It's quite small but elegantly decorated - a very intimate and romantic setting.  After 2-3 minutes, we were escorted to our seats.\n\nOur server was professional and friendly and did a great job explaining the menu to us.  I started with the dungeness crab salad which had 2-3 layers of cabbage, grapefruit, dungeness crab on thinly sliced pineapple chips, sat on top of grapefruit gelee.  The flavor was subtle, so didn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the crab.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nFor the main entree, I had the butter poached lobster which was cooked very tender, not at all chewy.  It sat on top of a giant butter squash ravioli and toasted almond.  Very nice.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Baked Alaska with raspberry and basil ice cream - it was excellent.\n\nThe server was extremely attentive, and observed the pace of our eating from afar.  When drinks run low, he would come by offering refills.  The chef came out and greeted us toward the end - nice touch.\n\nHowever, the pairing wasn't anything that was unique (like Trevese) nor the preparation (like Michael Mina which everything is in three's) - they've set the bar high for me.  So while I think it was worthy of Michelin Guide, it was on par with my dinner at Boulevard.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience in a very intimate and special setting.", "author": "Yuan W."}

I will forever love and hate you for letting me hold in my hands and smell fat gigantuous truffles that I wish I could bottle and take home with me. \n\nMy friend and I came here for my birthday dinner on Tuesday night. Just a heads up, call in advance (I do not mean day of, I mean a couple days before) to make reservations. The restaurant itself is not that big and they're usually booked at least the day before. It's easy to see why though, with the food that they serve and the attention of the waitstaff to every detail, it's clear the restaurant strives for perfection and to make your dining experience as perfect as they can. Service was impeccable. Our waitress was amazing, from the way she poured the water making sure to place a cloth in front of the glass so she wouldn't splash on you, to the detailed knowledge of the menu. The chef even came out at the end of the evening to ask us how our meal went and wish me a happy birthday!!! I felt so special. \n\nNow to review the food: \nTempura duck egg: 4.5 stars\nIt's a soft boiled duck egg fried in tempura batter, sitting on top of a sweetbread cake, that comes with this truffle sauce next to it. The sauce...that was basically to die for. Did I mention there were shaved truffles on top of the egg? \nFoie grais tourchon: 3.5 stars\nThis dish was really amazing, albeit a little on the sweet side for me. The foie grais in this dish is served cold, and it sits atop a peanut butter and chocolate...cookie? almost cookie? It is accompanied with squab, which had the most delightful texture, almost like beef tongue, very tender! fig jam and brioche (mine came looking like a turtle which I thought was really cute) \nWild cod: 5 stars\nThe cod was cooked perfectly! The skin was crispy, but the fish was tender. Perfectly seasoned too. The tempura squash blossom stuffed with lobster was...probably one of the most amazing tempura'd items I have ever tasted. \nAt the end of dinner, they brought out a plate that had 4 different kinds of mini one-bite desserts for my birthday.

So I thought.  Sadly, there was a rather loud, self-appointed food and wine expert (a wealthy looking Rush Limbaugh look-alike, his napkin tucked into his shirt collar, really!) at the table of four next to us.  My suggesting he whisper would have only made matters worse.  So, I flicked petits pois at his table and, just as loudly as he, regaled the room with tales of Dread Pirate Roberts and the advantages of AT&T DSL over Comcast high speed internet.\n\nOur Captain/waiter was nice enough, but wet behind the ears.  He was very mechanical as he introduced us to the menu, and he displayed no knowledge of the wine list.  [At this point I began a dismay-death spiral; the wine list was simply terrible.  Even with the assistance of the usually charming and accommodating Maitre d' (he's Chef Passot's, brother mind you), I found nothing worthy of ordering.  (And I sat there actually wondering how the Michelin Guide people could have overlooked this.)]  \n\nBut there was a chance at redemption; for a few seconds, I felt gravity letting go; and my dining buddy, Lena, was smiling.  They had a special Truffle Tasting Menu which was presented by our waiter who had arrived with huge black truffles sitting on a bed of sea salt.  \"Smell them, they're from Perigord,\" he said.  We obliged thinking what a gross thing for him to suggest and hoping nobody would see us sticking our noses against what looked like and probably smelled like a wild boar's butt.  No smell, strange.  (I should have announced then and there that no decent black truffle would call Perigord home!  Oh, how I missed Alba and Piemonte!)  And I'm sensing we were in trouble...  I was whiffing disappointment--and costly disappointment at that!\n\nSo, the first of several teasers, \"les amuses bouches,\" arrived.  Forgettable.  Why, because I forget what it was.  Next was a scambled egg with truffles thingee.  Interesting despite the totally yuugly presentation (plain white plate--like an escargot plate but with a single indent, too large a brown egg shell holding this runny yellow gunk in it with a soggy bread stick and a single strand of something green poking out).  The truffle taste was no doubt from synthetic truffle oil!  Then arrives a ceramic spoon of lobster reduction that was too thick, too rich, and in it what may have been a  piece of candied cherry or raisin or something--just a terrible combo.  (I warned Lena, \"Don't eat that.  I need to pull that dark glob out first.\"  Too late.  She goes, \"Eww!  How could you let me eat that?\"  The dismal gravity swirlingly intensifies.\n\nBut there's hope.  Out comes the Foie Gras.  Huge!  Delicious.  And the smiling waiter arrives with a glass of Royal Tokaji.  \"Six barrels,\" he says.  WTF?  Minutes later, \"I meant Six Putonnyos!\"  Whatever, the meal is looking up, finally.  Lena's smiling again, and the guy at the next table is quiet, eyes glazed over.  But I'm keeping watch.  He looks like he might hurl.\n\nMain course, Tenderloin.  Hers, off the regular menu, spectacular, as good as it gets; mine, off the Truffle Menu (okay, I admit, I'm a gluttonous masochist), the Crusted Tenderloin with Shaved Truffle, boring.  Actually, pulling off the tasteless truffles and the crustedness yielded a delicious piece of meat.  I left the $45 supplementals on my plate for the kittens in the kitchen.\n\nDesert, Green Tea Creme Brulee and Apple Bread Pudding, sad both.  The creme brulee (served on the same spoon as the less-than-amusing lobster  teaser) had sounded so good; it was icky.  The bread pudding had hope, but was ruined by the undercooked apples.

The waiter gave me another half a glass because he said I had to try the wine with my entree.  I thought this was extremely nice of him, and showed that he cared about how overall experience was. \n\nA nice hard bread was served with butter.  Two different amuse bouche were served at the beginning of the meal.  The first was what he waiter called peanut butter and jelly.  It was a spoon with pistachio foam, peanut brittle, and huckleberry jam.  The second was a Peteluma egg, poached in the shell, with green garlic, chive, and a potato crisp on top.  This was among one of the best things I ate during the meal.\n\nThe first course I chose was a Triple T Ranch Tempura Duck Egg, on Sweetbreads Pancake, Frangelico Almond Pesto, Wild Mushroom Salad, Truffle Vinaigrette.  It was also topped with thin shavings of black truffle.  The pesto was amazing.  The sweetbread pancake was very good - not something I have eaten very often.\n\nThe second course was a Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Spice Poached Apple and Apple Consomme, which was poured into the bowl when it was served.  The Foie was great.  Every bite melted in my mouth. The serving was huge.  I could have been happy with just half of what I was served.  \n\nThe Third course was Millbrook Farms Venison, Farro Risotto, Braised Red Cabbage, Celery Root Puree, with Huckleberry Sauce.  This was a very bold dish.  This was the first time I've had venison, and it was much milder than I expected. The risotto was very flavorful, and the the braised red cabbage was a nice contrast to the meat.\n\nAnother intermediary of rosemary mousse with cucumber caviar was served before the dessert course.\n\nFor dessert I had the Huckleberry Baked Alaska with Huckleberry and Basil Ice Creams, Lemon Biscuit, and Huckleberry Panna Cotta. The meringue was very light, crispy, and sweet.  The ice cream was light and well flavored.\n\nI was so full at this point, but there was one final dish of small sweets served, which we had boxed up to go.\n\nThe food was very upscale and delicious, the servings very generous, the service impeccable, and overall a very pleasant experience.  It met every expectation I had.\n\nSo maybe I should give it five stars then?", "author": "Stephen S."}

I'm not so much the girley dress type, but I'm glad I did this time.  The ambiance is very classy and elegant and the service matched it.  It wasn't stuffy and the staff was very pleasant.  They even called me (very kindly) to check up on me since we were running late.\n\nWe both had a 4 course meal. Forgive me as I will most probably butcher the names and descriptions.\nHim - Sweet corn chowder with sweet breads and lobster.  Deliciously sweet (and I just found out what sweetbreads are. hehe). Yum!\nLobster and wild mushroom risotto - double yum!\nLobster tail - This was ok.  My bf enjoyed it but I found it a bit bland.\nChocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream - VERY yum, pretty much a fancy molten lava cake.\n\nMe- Dungeness crab salad over some kind of green veggie panna cotta. Yum!\nHawaiian butter fish - Double Yum!  Very savory and bursting with flavor.\nDuck breast with duck confit salad - Triple Yum!  This was both our favorite.\nPeach Melba for dessert - this was a meringue like thing with peach ice cream and poached peach inside.  This was a very nice finishing touch and left my taste buds dancing.\n\nIn between courses, they of course offered small pallet cleansers.  The flavors and presentation were absolutely wonderful.  The 4-course dinner and wine came out to be around $260 including tip. In short, a wonderful experience that I would definitely recommend for a special occasion.

I was very happy because they had black truffles the night we ate.  I can't describe food other than \"it was real good\" but all were hits, even if I didn't care for the dish itself.  For example, foie gras is not my thing, but it was still good, and huge.  Some portions are larger than others, but I left feeling roly-poly, in a good way.\n\nIn addition to the 3 courses, the chef gave 3 amuse bouches before the courses, a palate cleanser of caradamon pudding before dessert, and petit fours to finish off the meal.  We spent 3 hours in this place and it felt like one because they didn't rush us.\n\nI really liked their spotlight lighting: the dimness of a classy place with enough light to see each other and the food. I loved how they told us about the ingredients in each dish when they bought out the food. It made me feel like I was on \"Top Chef.\" (I'm sure they love being compared to a reality show.) \n\nService was very personable without being cloying. I have never refined the art of letting someone else sit me, so I'd like to say sorry to the guy who had to push my butt to the table.  Oh, and a note on the silverware.  If they take it away, and they do with each course, they give you a whole new set! Ok, ok, I live a plebian life but I call that service!\n\nCaveats: We went on a Monday night, so it wasn't crowded.

Of course, it may have helped that I wasn't picking up the tab.  Or that I was escorted there and back home again in a stretch limo.  Whatever it was, the evening simply could not have been more perfect.  \n\nFrom arrival, at which time we promptly ordered a glass of Champagne, to each phase of the many-course tasting menu, I was in absolute bliss.  A few notable details:   try the foie gras ANYTHING at La Folie.  You'll never regret it, and rarely spend more doing it, so why not??  You won't be disappointed.  Listen to the sommelier and assistant.  We had a female sommelier who recommended outstanding pairings with our courses.  Plus, it's so fun to try a new wine with each course - I definitely recommend going by the glass rather than the bottle given the prix fixe nature of the menu.  I had, at sommelier's suggestion, an East Indian Sherry with my foie.  I mean, helLO!  So exciting and different, and a great match.\n\nDownsides (believe me, there aren't many):  our desserts were good, but not delicious, as was most everything else we had.

Living in the culinary oyster otherwise known as San Francisco will do that to a guy.  That said, I was a little disappointed in La Folie.\n\nMy partner and I always switch plates halfway through and therefore ended up with 12 courses each so I feel like we really got a good sampling of what La Folie had to offer.  Dinner was not what I'd call exquisite but it had all the elements.  The service was very good but not flawless.  The food was more off than on in terms of how ingredients blended tastewise but was presented very well.\n\nFor how the food looked, I just wanted a little more \"wow\" when I bit into it.  There were a couple of seafood dishes that were so bland they left me wanting something more - salt, sweet, sour - to finish them off.  The frog legs were coated in WAY too much garlic that left my mouth stinging.  The trios of rabbit and beef each had only one presentation that tasted great.  \n\nOn the positive side, the room was very tasteful and well apportioned, the server took really good care of us and there was a fois gras dish that I wanted to take home and go to bed with.  \n\nIt ended up being our most expensive dinner to date in the City (we ordered an $85 bottle of wine and it was still more expensive than Gary Danko).  I'd have to be very wealthy to want to spend money on the food there again, especially with so many high-end French options in SF, but overall it was a 4-star experience.

La Folie is about as good as it gets for San Francisco French food but it should be noted there is a another higher class of french food available outside of SF.  \n\nI came on a Saturday night for a 9pm reservation.  It was Labor Day  weekend and it seems their reservations were all running about 30 minutes to a hour late.  The hostess and bartender were incredibly apologetic and everyone got champagne and aperatifs on the house while waiting.  I was seated by about 10pm.  The service at La Folie borders on flawless for its caliber of restaurant.  You could (and I did) ask about any question about the ingredients and their origins and the waiters readily had the answer for you.  The sommelier was also very helpful and advised me on my selecftion of a half bottle of Bordeaux.  I spoke to the chef/owner in French for a bit which is something I definitely only do after too much wine :-).  \n\nFood...\n\nFor starters I had the Tasting of Passot Roe.  The waiter advised me to start with the Kona Kampachi with the fennel radish salad, next eat the lobster with roe, and finish off the the crab and meyer lemon parfait.  The dish is highly recommended but ...I felt like the taste of the roe was drowned out by the lobster and the fennel-radish salad.  \n\nNext I had the Frogs legs.  They were a wonderful mix of the meat's tenderness, the fried butter-y taste, the slight crunchiness, and the sauces (you could mainly taste the garlic) complimenting the meat.\n\nFor the main entree, I had the rabbit with baby vegetables.  The rabbit was extremely good, it wasn't too game-y, the sauce added to the overall dish.\n\nAs a dessert, I had the peach melba which was a great end to the meal.\n\nOverall... while I was a little skeptical after the long wait to sit down, La Folie's food and ambience were solid.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-11-10", "description": "I was extremely disappointed with La Folie. My husband and I dined here this past Saturday in celebration of my 30th birthday. After reading that some Yelpers, Chowhounders, Zagaters, etc. had the best meals of their lives here, I was very much looking forward to it.\n\nMy biggest points of contention with our $350 meal were: \n\n(1) The menu, in both design and execution - I ordered the cauliflower soup w/ lobster, seared foie gras, and veal stuffed w/ sweetbreads. However, our two amuse bouches were a foie gras mouse and a poached egg yolk over a cauliflower puree, both of which were very good. But . . . you know how when you crave a particular food, you tend to order it on the menu, and you're soooo looking forward to tasting it that your mouth begins to water just thinking about it? And then your food comes, and that first bite is simply orgasmic? \n\nWell, I was looking forward to experiencing that with the seared foie gras, and to a lesser extent, the cauliflower soup. And when I got both those flavors before I even had my first course, my experience with my courses was completely diluted. I would think a restaurant of La Folie's caliber would account for this sort of thing.\n\nSpeaking of the foie -- I received a terrible cut of foie. Yes, it was a huge portion, which the server seemed proud of. But, it was stringy and chewy, indicating that the restaurant did not trim the liver properly. It was also mis-shaped, sort of like a flying saucer, which meant the pan sear was totally uneven. I didn't even finish it (unheard of for me, one of the biggest fans of properly done foie). The table next to us also ordered a seared foie, and theirs seemed of much better quality and shape.  But then again, they were much older and spoke French. Not that that should matter when we're all paying the same prices, right?\n\nMy soup was excellent, and the veal very good, although by that time, I couldn't enjoy it. Hubby had the lobster risotto (also excellent), black cod (average) and beef three-ways (below average). The filet on his dish was very overcooked -- he asked for medium rare, but it was closer to a medium/well-done. The outside was charred to the point of being crispy, which isn't so bad if the inside wasn't overcooked. The braised short rib was good and the \"hamburger\" seemed to be more of a fun/cute side thing than a real part of the dish (it was tiny, with a tiny little bun and little slice of lettuce and tomato). \n\n(2) The pacing of the courses -- I've been to Cyrus, so I know what it's like to have a 3-hour meal. But at Cyrus, those 3 hours flew by because the amuse bouches and the courses were paced perfectly. At La Folie, we constantly felt like we were waiting around. First, for our butter (which tasted like margarine). Then, our bread. Then, our amuse bouche. Then, our courses. We'd ordered wine pairing and I had a difficult time trying not to finish my wine before my courses arrived, which is not fun. \n\n(3) The size of the courses -- way too big. I specifically asked the server if we ordered more courses (you have a choice of 3/4/5), would the restaurant portion them out for us so the appropriate amount of food was served. He said yes, but based on how stuffed we were after our second apps, and the portions of other diners who ordered fewer courses than us, this was absolutely not true -- and we're both huge eaters. \n\nAgain, maybe this doesn't bother people who think it's better to have too much food than not enough, but when you're paying over $150/person, I'd like to think that my dining experience would be perfect -- not too much, not too little.\n\nConclusion: I will not be returning to La Folie. It has all the trappings of a \"special occasion\" restaurant/experience -- Russian Hill location, valet parking, free coat check, old money clientele, fanatic devotees that go on message boards claiming it to be the best French in the city, etc. But the most important component -- the food -- is just not there, especially if you're a sophisticated diner who has certain expectations when at this type of restaurant.\n\nBottom line: If you have a choice, spend your money elsewhere.", "author": "Veronica S."}

I'm happy to have tried it, but I probably would not go back. Esp. at $450 for two, plus $15 for valet parking, I think we could do better. \n\nWINES: AVERAGE. We started with a pinot noir that was average, but somewhat bitter, and a reisling that was surprisingly thin/watery. \n\nAPPETIZERS: AVERAGE. The orange cappucino lobster soup was interesting but quite weird and I did feel a little ill from it. The bread was very hard and sour. I have had much better baguettes in Paris; this was not anywhere close. The fresh oyster with roe was good (can't mess that up too much if the ingredients are good), but the sea urchin cream soup was again, a little too rich and weird. The shave of tuna with radish was OK but plain.\n\nMAIN COURSE: AVERAGE/BELOW AVERAGE. The lamb on the rack was actually somewhat plain. The veal with sweetmeat was just not that great either. The truffles didn't really add much to the dish. In fact, we both did not feel like finishing it all. The lobster was good but slightly too firm, perhaps cooked a tad too long but I did eat it all because there wasn't much else I liked. \n\nDESSERTS: AVERAGE. The raspberry sorbet was tangy and pungent, but the layered chocolate cake was just average. The creme brulee was simply not tasty. My dining companion is a creme brulee fanatic and did not want to eat it.\n\nSERVICE: AVERAGE/SOMETIMES SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE. The wait service was inconsistent. Sometimes they would come and announce the food in lavish detail, but other times some random person just set it down and left. They did seem to get things done relatively unobtrusively, such as cleaning, resetting, etc. We did not see our waiter that much; various different people came to fill water, bring food, etc., so we did not feel very bonded to one waiter. Without a trusty guide in such a fancy restaurant, I personally felt a bit abandoned. \n\nDECOR/AMBIANCE: AVERAGE. The colors in the gold room are very pretty, and it is quiet. However, I personally did not like sitting stacked right next to other couples; it felt a little like we were all speed dating and everyone was about to move one seat to the right. I could hear the two adjacent couples' conversations loud and clear and in fact, I started talking to them at the end of the meal because it seemed so awkward not to acknowledge that we were elbow to elbow. They were nice and that was the little moment of fun in an otherwise somewhat dreary meal.\n\nPARKING: Finally, the valet parking service is terrible. It took 25 minutes to bring our car after the meal ended, and the guy revved our car so hard you could smell the smoke. Then he proceeded to argue with us because we didn't want to tip him. That left a bit of a negative edge on the whole evening. \n\nOVERALL: For me, this was just OK and just so, so expensive. They did give us each a box containing two Recchiuti chocolates but the retail value of that is $5 which did not offset the feeling of continuing slight disappointment. There's just no WOW factor at all.", "author": "p v."}

All of the tables in the main dining room are good, but the window tables are great.  \n\nStart with the cocktails.  They rotate the signature cocktails by season.  Consider the French Rose (Tanqueray 10, cranberry, other things I don't remember and a rosemary sprig that provides a great finish) and the Cucumber Gimlet.  They also do a great Old Fashioned.  But the full bar can accommodate any cocktail needs.  \n\nThe first amuse-bouche, a lobster/crab terrine with a squid ink accent was yummy, but did not compare to the truffle egg amuse-bouche.  \n\nThe menu can be a bit confusing.  On the left, there is one vegetarian fixed price course and one rotating course that was winter-truffle based when we went.  The right side of the menu has a series of plates from which there are three, four and five course options.  We had the four course at $90 per person.  \n\nHighlights of the meal included the seared foie gras, the crispy frog legs and the pigs feet terrine served on chopped lobster.

Our waiter was great and quite knowledgeable, and also friendly.  (A bald guy like me, who is studying engineering, or so I overheard). The lady who brought the dishes was curt and a bit snooty.  She quickly described the dish, and before I could look up from my plate, she had turned her back away, and headed back to the kitchen.  She wore the glasses on top her head.  A bit rude.\nI still prefer Gary Danko or Fleur de Lys over this place.  I might give it another try.  Also, too long a wait between courses.  The four course menu ran a little over two hours.

It'll jump out of your plate and slap you on the forehead.  Everything else is big portions too.  Although I must say, the quality of the foie gras, despite its size, is not as good as say of, Gary Danko, or Jean-Georges in NYC.  It's not as smooth and creamy, but still definitely very very good.\n\nIn lines with trying to give a good critique of this place, the restaurant is spacy and roomy.  You don't feel claustrophobic like some other restaurants.  If you ask, they'll make fresh lemonade for you.  The only thing I wasn't jumping out of my seat was the service.

This restaurant was recommended to me by a good friend and my parents who were visiting invited a bunch of us (French and American people).\n\nWe were a group of 7 people and came for diner. We were placed in the back room (no window, very outdated decor). The service was good. We ordered 4 courses each and were provided with the extras that you expect in this type of restaurants (ex: soups and appetizers between courses).\n\n1. The diner lasted three and a half hours. By the end, we were ready to leave before desserts! I am sorry, but I call that \"the chef cannot deal with more than 2 customers\". You do not want to eat, then be starving by the next course.\n\n2. The food was extremely disappointing! As I said, I know what that type of cuisine is supposed to taste like (having lived in France for 20 years and being used to the very good French cuisine you can find in California and the Bay Area in particular):\n- Some parts of some courses were not properly cooked (either over- or under-)\n- My girlfriend's chocolate dessert was hard on the inside (it is supposed to be liquidy on the inside)\n- Very pretentious presentation for a meal that did not taste great\n\n3. The staff is dishonest!!! My parents are from Europe and thus not used to the tip system. I had told them to leave about 20% in advance. As expected for a large party of 7 people, the check included the tip already. Unaware, my parents added 20% of tip to the check (that included already 20%), thus leaving more than 40% of tip.\nTHE STAFF DID NOT HAVE THE HONESTY TO DISCREETLY CONFIRM WITH MY PARENTS (during or after submission of the payment) THAT THEY WERE PAYING MORE THAN 40% OF TIP.\n\nI call this behavior dishonest and fully reflective of Roland Passot's vulgar attitude towards everything: More recently, I was dining in another Bay Area restaurant and noticed that he was dining with his children a few tables away from us: Children screaming and pushing each other, glasses falling....\n\nI will never go back. It used to be a great restaurant, but it is going down in terms of quality.

I went with my boyfriend and brother (who is a chef) for my brother's birthday.  We all decided on the four-course dinner option.  We also received three courses on the house. \n\nI think that the consensus was that all of our appetizers were very good (foie gras with caramelized peaches; corn chowder with lobster; crab salad), as were the egg amuse bouche and a ginger sorbet with strawberry granita amuse bouche.  The entrees, however, were lacking in flavor and balance.  I had black cod (aka sablefish) with potatoes and porcini mushrooms, my boyfriend had salmon with gnocchi, and my brother had veal with sweetbreads.  The desserts were all great -- we had the chocolate fondant with brandied dried fruits, chocolate bombe with passion fruit mousse, and baked peach melba.  Maybe we were too stuffed by the end, but the complimentary amuse bouche desserts seemed bland and uninteresting. \n\nAs for drinks, my brother started with a glass of champagne that was really nice, and he had a pinot noir with dinner that was also good.  My boyfriend had a rose that was pretty good.  The chef came out toward the end of dinner to ask how everything was.  He sent over complimentary dessert wines because the service had been slow (we spent 3 hours there!) -- two 1983 (I think) ports, and one muscadet (again, I think).  These were delicious and went well with the desserts.\n\nBy the time we had gotten through everything, we were entirely stuffed and (mostly) satisfied.

He was very attentive and helpful with our questions and requests. The rest of the waitstaff was very attentive but didn't hover too much which was great.

It was good, but i dont think the quality was as good as the foie gras they serve at Gary Danko's\nlobster ravioli, garlic soup, squab and venison were all great....\n\ni love how they give u other little appetizers while your waiting for your other courses to arrive, my boyfriend and i each had the 5 course and we got like 3 other complimentary mini courses.  He practically had to roll me out of there... But the best thing i liked about this place is the owner Chef Roland Passot greeted us when we got there, came out and checked on us during our meal and even said good bye to us...the only other place that i've been too that does that is Chapeau! and i love that....", "author": "Steph S."}

We each had four courses. These courses are huge. I would not recommend more than three - I wish they would lower the price and have smaller portions. I was absolutely stuffed after the second course. You're able to substitute any of the items from the Chef's tasting menu as one of your entrees if you choose to pick your own courses. \n\nWe started with an amuse bouche that was a poached egg (in shell) with brioche. It was incredible. \n\nFoie gras soup - it comes with seared foie gras on the side and glazed baby turnips. The foe gras soup itself was a bit too rich for me and it was very foamy. The seared foie gras on the side is more than enough for two people to share as appetizer. \n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras - this was the biggest piece of foie gras I've ever seen, about the size of fist. It's enough for five people to split. There is a $10 supplement, but honestly they should just serve a 1/4 of it and not charge a supplement. I wish the waitress warned us that ordering this and the foie gras soup was a bit repetitive. It was absolutely delicious though - my fiance was moaning as it melted in his mouth. \n\nPig fee, sweetbread and lobster terrine - this was good, but with everything else I had it was just too rich. I wish I had picked something more \"green.\" My fiance loved it, but it was just a bit too much for me. At this point I was really full. \n\nButter poached lobster on squash ravioli - we paid $25 to add truffle flakes to this. It was very good and the squash ravioli was excellent. I wouldn't pay for the truffle flakes again, just not worth it and it doesn't add much to the dish. \n\nLobster and Mushroom Risotto - we also added truffle flakes to this dish. This was amazing, perfectly cooked risotto with tons of flavor, did not need to add the truffles. \n\nI had the Lamb rack and my fiance had the Le Boeuf. The lamb was awesome and Le Bouef was perfect as well. Unfortunately, we were both so full that we only ate a 1/4 of our main dishes. \n\nFor dessert we split the \"huckleberry backed alaska\" it was really delicious and not too sweet or rich, just perfect. \n\nWe also had a bottle of wine that was very good, but the name escapes me.  The sommelier was very friendly and helpful.  One thing that annoyed me were the large crowds there for birthday dinners that got really drunk and felt the need to give toasts to the entire restaurant.   All in all, it was an amazing meal but I don't think it was worth $500, more like $300.  I prefer Gary Danko if I'm going to drop that kind of money on dinner. \n\nWorst part of the night: leaving our leftovers in the cab!", "author": "Katie S."}

I went here around 11 pm on Friday night after going for dinner in Potrero.  I loved the decor and the variety of champagne by the glass options! It had a good sized crowd but not overcrowded. It was fairly well-dressed crowd enjoying their drinks. I have to say it was a little smaller than I was hoping for giving it a vibe of feeling like I was in a living room of a party where I didn't know anyone. I am happy that it's in my neighborhood and will probably drop in for a  drink from time to time.

Chef Roland uses this delicacy in everything from Foie Gras soup to the surprise stuffing inside my mini burger on my l'assiette du boeuf. which was excellent! every dish is a work of art and the flavors work very well together. this evening I also had the osetra caviar, which was served a potato pancake stuffed with a delicate morsel of sturgeon and bits of asparagus. the caviar was simply placed on top of the potato pancake along side a dab of creme fraiche. an incredible way to start the evening. the seared Hawaiian Kampachi paired with a poached lobster claw followed and showcased the chef's expertise with fish. it was nicely seasoned and seared. unfair to single out one dish but the fried frog's legs beautifully placed around a pool of garlic puree and parsley coulis received high praise from my blessed tastebuds. the most interesting food pairing tonight was the deboned oxtail in red wine reduction and the pan roasted Sturgeon. the juxaposition of the boldly braised savory oxtail with the sturgeon worked well. even more so with the purely French wine pairing matched by the sommelier for us this evening. The artistically presented cheese platter and the apple tart with maple ice cream finished off the courses for our group this evening in a wonderful way. Somewhat disappointed our wine pairing did not include a port but I will get over it. the petit fours of lychee pate de fruit, et al more than made up for that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-08", "description": "I cannot in good conscience give less than five stars to La Folie. It is a wonderful place, for the reasons which I will enumerate below:\n\n1.  La Folie does not believe in tiny portions: I wish I knew this before coming, or else I would've skipped lunch altogether. See, I'm used to the adorable, yet microscopic portions you would receive at any other high-class French place. So when my fiance and I ordered the four course special, I thought that we'd be adequately satiated. But then...the pig feet-sweetbread terrine came out.  In my non-imaginative mind, a terrine conjures a slice of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Terrine_de_saumon_au_basilic.JPG.  Instead, a ginormous patty of delicious meat and mustard-dressed-frisee comes out, which while delicious, left me pretty much full (this was course 2/4).  It was a test of endurance to get through the rest of the incredibly wonderful dinner, and I spent the rest of my time wishing I had the right amount of hunger to appreciate things properly, as well as a bigger ribcage.\n\n2. Food is crazy good: I mean CRAZY.  The presentation was elegant, modern, and chiefly whimsical - the beet salad in particular should've been in Ratatouille with a proud looking Remy next to it.  It was that adorable, with the little roots sticking up in the air and little pea sprouts nestled in between.  Fleur de Lys doesn't stand a chance here. \n\n3. Service is fantastic/not pretentious: \n      3.a: La Folie flies in the face of the stereotypical French snobbery that one would expect in this sort of establishment. Our waiter was considerate, explained the menu in a sincere manner to us, and accommodated our request to receive the check early and box up our petit fours like a champion.  He was the perfect balance of attentiveness and letting us be.  \n      3.b: Also, since we were heading to Bourbon and Branch right away, the Older-Rita-Hayworth-esque hostess was kind enough to ask the valet to hail us a cab.  She suggested we wait inside to keep out of the chill, which was pretty lovely of her. Seconds later, we had a cab and were on our way!\n      3.c: Lastly, the chef came out to check on our dinner and make sure everything was perfect.  At the time, I was stuffing my face with delicious bread pudding and basil ice cream, so I think I mumbled a \"Everything is delicious!\" and let things be. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for a place to have some delicious French cuisine that's innovative, down-to-earth, and delicious, go to La Folie. You won't regret the experience.", "author": "Michelle N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-23", "description": "Ahhh....fine dining. It's great to go to a restaurant of this caliber once in a while. La Folie is another excellent place in my neighborhood that offers well-prepared food, excellent service, and a pleasant dining experience. The menu offers soo many selections that it takes a good 20 minutes or glass of wine to decide what you'll finally have. There's the option of 3-4-5-6 course tasting menus. And you're not limited to one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. \n\nI started off with the corn soup with unagi and foie gras. Who would have thought corn soup would pair so well with the delicately balanced unagi. Scrumptious! Next I had the seared scallop which was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside (something I have never been able to succeed in my own kitchen!). For my entree I got the veal loin that was wrapped in a sweetbread type of dough. The veal was really tender but once I got a bite of my BF dish, I had food envy the rest of the evening. Hands down, the beef trio was the best thing on the ENTIRE menu. It had a bitty filet mignon, small piece of shortrib, and a mini kobe beef burger. Oh and to top it all off, the meat was drizzled in a truffle sauce....hmm.... All of it was absolutely excellent!\n\nService was incredible and wine list was extensive. I would definitely consider going back to this place for a special occasion.", "author": "Josephine H."}

Anyway, the service was superb and there were lots of chef compliments. I had the 5 courses and was bursting through the seams at the end of the dinner.\n\nI started with the corn soup with foie gras and I loved the table side presentation. Then I followed up with the frog legs, which I was not impressed with. They were really baby sized and frankly I love the Chinese restaurant version much better. The lobster was sublime. It was great portion and it wasn't overwhelming. My favorite though was the duck. It was just a great and classic combination of the duck and fig. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I could do without the duck confit and the chives crepe at that point. The dessert unfortunately didn't hit the spot for me. I had the golden tower which was berries and short sweet bread. I felt underwhelmed with it.\n\nBut overall the service was fantastic, fast, and gracious. They really were aiming for customer satisfaction. The wait staff were great, although I can do without the pissy poker faces from the host & hostess at the door. I didn't care for that. I actually did meet the chef. When I was waiting for the check he came out and asked how was everything. Overall I would definitely come back again. The guests over at the next table highly recommended the foie gras because its generous portions and excellent executions. She actually cried when she was eating her foie gras, which made me extremely curious.\n\n[After note: after this review was published on yelp, I received a thank you email from the chef.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-07", "description": "Wow, so this is what it's like to live in Pac Heights.  I have limited myself in the other part of SF for so long that I forget even the existence of this posh neighborhood.   The chic stores, trendy restaurants, nice apartment buildings, and on every corner there is a man in a funky suit straight from one of those \"the Sartorialist blog\" pictures: the faux-hawk, the bright pink leather shoes, the perfectly pressed white pants and navy jacket.  Yes, it's 6pm and the sun is still shining, and you are all dressed up hailing a cab.  \n\nSecond impression: damn, there is no parking.  We circled around for 20 min and had to do valet.  I grew up in the city; I should know every nook and hidden parking possibilities in every neighborhood.  I was ashamed and frustrated that we couldn't find a single space.  And I was willing to walk far too---I brought my walkin' shoes so my Louboutins won't have touch the public street, ever.   But our reservation time was up and we had to give up.\n\nArrival: I didn't like their kitschy, circus-y looking website and I didn't like the interior all that much either.  We were seated in the back room, in a corner.  We love those corner seats: you get to sit closer together and survey the entire room.  The room, however, felt like an old Oxford library or an small chapel with tall ceiling or a room designed to play Murder Mystery.  Just not my thing.  I like airy modern minimalist decors.  \n\nSpecial Occasion: yes, it's our 4 year anniversary.  And we try to find a Gary Danko equivalent to try for those special occasions.  I picked La Folie because I saw they have black cod on the menu.  Oops.  The menu changes.  \n\nFood: Bread is good but do I need to waste your time talking about bread here at a 4 star restaurant?  Amuse bouches were fantastic!  The first was a cold salad of Belize shrimp with crunchy grilled slices of octopus.  Great flavor, great texture.  The second was a runny egg yolk mixed with truffles in its original egg shell.  Extremely beautiful presentation and I loved the gooeyness of the egg and the subtle truffle flavor. \n\nYou may pick and choose any three or four dishes to make up your own courses, so we sacrificed dessert for an extra appetizer.  Actually I picked a fish as my second course, and they told me they'd size it to an appetizer but it was huge!  Anyway, 1st course: boyfriend had the \"tasting of passot roe\" which had hamachi, sea urchin with seaweed salad and roe on top, and lobster salad.  He loved the taste of them all, but thought the seaweed salad was too heavy and overpowering for the delicate sea urchin.  I had crab salad.  Big chunks of crab on pineapple chips and mixed with citrus and on a bed of grapefruit jelly.  It tasted fresh and well balanced. I loved this dish.\n\n2nd course: boyfriend had the foie gras from Hudson Valley.  Yep, it's true.  It's huge!  I don't know how he finished it but he did.  I had sturgeon because the waiter recommended it.  He said you don't see sturgeon on menus of restaurants very often.  Really?  But...Anyway, I should have listened to my inner doubt: if that statement is questionable, can I really trust his recommendation?  turns out, not so much.  The sturgeon was boring and bland. I could've had that anywhere.\n\n3rd course: boyfriend had venison from Pennsylvania.  He loved it.  I had squab and quail.  I am usually a seafood person, not really into meat.  But I thought it was gonna be like the succulent quail and squab I had at Gary Danko.  unfortunately it was neither as juicy or as flavorful.  \n\nIt was wise not to get dessert.  They gave us little bites of sweets after dinner.  Hazelnut chocolate, a tiny cannele, fruit gelee, and a madeleine with a cherry inside.  A nice way to finish the dinner. \n\n3 course dinner $75, pretty reasonable for a restaurant of that caliber.", "author": "Candice B."}

We started with a bottle of De Loach pinot noir and we each selected the 4 course meal for $85 each.\n\nShortly after we ordered, we were presented with an amuse bouche, a sweet cantaloupe ball in a spoon. Yum! What a way to start the meal! As we were enjoying our wine, they brought us a complimentary dish from the chef, an eggy type appetizer in its shell. It was a smooth, creamy dish - not my fav but still enjoyable.\n\nWhat followed was our 4 course meal - crab salad, fois gras, mushroom and lobster risotto, scallops, lobster ravioli, rabbit, and veal. As each dish appeared, we were engulfed with the lovely aroma of each plate and the beautiful presentation. The server described each dish as they presented them to us, I felt like I was on Iron Chef America! It was great! I guess you could say that my only complaint was my rabbit dish. That particular dish did not really wow me. Maybe I'm just not a fan of rabbit? \n \nWhen we finished our last dish, our server brought out a plate of complimentary dessert for my hubby's birthday. It was so very nice! As we prepared to leave, our car was brought out to the front of the restaurant and they all bid us farewell.\n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful evening.

Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Caramelized Peaches and Spiced Peach Consomm\u00e9 - Definitely the highlight of this place. I was so surprised when it came out: the Foie Gras was huge! From the outside, it looked somewhat overcooked, but after tasting it, it was actually perfectly cooked. It was very succulent and juicy; I greatly enjoyed savoring it, chunk by chunk!\n\n2. Lobster and Mushroom Risotto, with Leeks and Lobster Broth - This dish is just heavenly! I swear it was SO GOOD. The perfect balance between the lobster taste and slight mushroom flavor. Everyone should try this, I'm SUPER CEREAL! Unfortunately though, the portion was tiny...

Over the years it has gone through several incarnations and the food has always been fabulous.  This last fancy incarnation is my least favorite, a bit to fancy but the food is still great and wow the service really makes you feel special.  The food is incredible if you like to unusuall combinations, my friend a more \"meat and potatoes\" kind of person gave me the two amuse buches which i loved and was glad to have hers. She liked what she ordered I loved my foi gras ( I always get it here and only here because it is the best) and lobster. The foi gras was not what I expected but it was huge piece of it. A full meal in of it self and absolutely the best. \nI also had the tempura egg wow divine, gooyness over vegtables and sweetbreads...how good does it get, my mouth is salivating. even now..When we were finished, the valet cars were waiting for us...a very nice touch to a special evening.", "author": "rassors T."}

Here is what we had... \n\n- Octopus Confit with Grains (Amuse Bouche): The grains were perfectly cooked, but we didn't really care for the octopus. The texture was oddly stringy and the technique of confit, which requires a long cooking time, plus it was served cold, made the octopus uncomfortably fishy. \n\n- Coddled Egg with Parsnip Puree (Amuse Bouche): The egg yolk was soft and luscious. The gray salt was a nice touch. \n\n- Tasting of Passot Roe with Kampachi, Sea Urchin Panna Cotta and Lobster Claw: The kampachi itself was a bit bland and definitely needed the optional citrus foam, but the roe was deliciously flavored with orange. The sea urchin panna cotta creatively captured the essence and richness of uni. My favorite part was the lobster claw. It was perfectly succulent. \n\n- Dungeness Crab on Coconut and Pineapple Panna Cotta: Only grudge on this dish was that we found bones in the crab. However, we are willing to forgive it for the panna cotta under it. It is much firmer than the typical panna cotta (almost like tofu). The coconuty goodness was paired with the crab nicely. \n\n- Warm Pig Feet, Sweet Bread and Lobster Terrine with Lentil Salad: I think this was one of my favorite dishes of the evening. The accompanying frisee salad was a little too salty, but the terrine was great! It was seared to get a little crisp around the skin. The pork was tender and moist, while the lobster was perfectly cooked. I usually dislike lentils, but this was delicious and well seasoned. \n\n- Lobster and Trumpet Mushroom Risotto and Lobster Broth: This was delicious and well executed. \n\n- Black Cod with Parsnip Puree: This was only ok. The cod was perfectly cooked but it was a bit bland. The skin needed more crisp. \n\n- Durade with Seared Baby Fennel Bulbs: Same with the durade. The skin needed more crisp and needed more seasoning on the other side. \n\n- Rack of Colorado Lamb: The loin was perfectly cooked and delicious, but what we really LOVED was the lamb tongue that accompanied it. We would have ordered it as a plate on its own. Tender, flavorful and seasoned through. \n\n- Tapioca with Apple, Orange and Meyer Lemon (Palate Cleanser): The meyer lemon had really hit the spot after the rich dishes. \n\n- Edam Cheese Souffle Topped with Crispy Bacon with Edam Cheese Sorbet: \"Because everything is better with bacon!\" My sistered order this dessert and she said it was great. I was WAY too full to decide on my own. \n\nThe portions at La Folie are very generous. I ordered a 3 course dinner and I left completely stuffed. My sister order the 5 course dinner and had trouble finishing her meal. \n\nThe service was gracious and the ambiance was elegant, but not stuffy. More importantly, while they had all time favorites like foie, lobster and scallops, they also offered a good variety of creative dishes.", "author": "Cherrie C."}

La Folie isn't in their league at all.  At all...   \n\nFirst, has the owner changed any of the restaurant's decor since he first opened in 1988?  They could have shot a Miami Vice episode in here.  Also what is up with the scary back room where they banish half of their guests?  From what I could tell it is where they put the under 50 crowd.  It has no windows, an eerie blue glow from the compact fluorescent lighting, no music and a weird mildew smell.  The food was pretty good but nothing blew me away.  Also, the dinner took 3 hours.

The merlot pairing here was spot on.\n\nThe seared foie gras with carmelized peaches was where I started feeling that some of the foie gras hype around the joint was deserved. Our guy paired it with a late-harvest wine that took it right over the top.\n\nCOURSE 3: I had black cod and she stayed on the sidelines for a course.Fish was cooked well, but the peppers never quite rhymed with the rest of the dish and despite the heat I found the dish bland and uninteresting. \n\nCOURSE 4: Squab and Quail for me, Veal for her. Knock down, drag out winners, but I had exhausted my gastro-intestinal system at this point (my fault not theirs) and could barely go on. Rare veal, surrounded with sweetbreads....so, so good.\n\nCOURSE 5: Dessert....I found the chocolate fondant a tad dry while my lovely las found the cheese souffle decadent and stunning. \n\nThere were lovely gifts from the kitchen, my favorite a taste of cardomom pudding and strawberry granite that was something I could have eaten a vat of.\n\nAgain, nothing particularly bad here, most of it quite good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-30", "description": "Warning! Snobbiness ahead!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a hankering for French food so we decided to try La Folie after hearing some good recommendations for this restaurant. We arrived promptly on time for our reservation at 5:45, and an older blonde woman with arched eyebrows directed us to our seats. Given that there were only two other couples in the restaurant at the time, I was slightly surprised when she completely bypassed the main room to go around the corner. \n\nAnd there it was...the ugliest dining room in all of San Francisco (at least in broad daylight). Decked out in purple and green with a hodge podge of items that someone seemed to have procured from a garage sale (a hideous masquerade themed cabinet in the corner and a strange idol-like monkey statuette). But to add insult to injury, this woman seated us right by the kitchen door, when there was no one else inside the ugly step-cousin of the main dining room. I was more than slightly irked receiving a gust of wind every time someone busily exited through the heavy kitchen door, not to mention the squeaking that accompanied it. (You'd think a restaurant of this caliber would shell out a dollar or two for some WD-40!) Needless to say, we asked to be seated elsewhere, but the snobby, blonde older hostess seemed rather unapologetic about it.\n\nOn to the food, which redeemed the restaurant somewhat..my boyfriend and I both ordered the five-course menu. The portions were generous, and we greatly enjoyed the amuse bouches complimentary of the chef (a refreshing fava bean puree served in an adorable pho spoon, and a poached egg served with a crouton). I ordered the dungeness crab salad, seared foie gras, lobster, quail and squab, and ended the meal with a chocolate bread pudding. The crab salad was quite innovative: served with a cauliflower pannacotta underneath delicious meaty crab. Next was the foie gras, which was a very generous portion my boyfriend and I both thought. The foie gras was prepared well. The outside was seared and crispy, and the maple syrup and huckleberry complimented the dish nicely. The lobster dish was decent. The lobster was served on top of a ravioli with various veggies on top in an almond sauce. My taste buds weren't exactly singing Handel's Hallelujah, but I enjoyed it (I always do with lobster). The quail and squab dish was delicious. Stuffed with mushroom and wrapped by crispy potato strings, the tenderness of the meat was excellent. Finally, the chocolate bread pudding for dessert was superb. Warm and sweet, served with a strawberry gelato sandwiched between crispy puff pasty sheets--I was in foodie heaven.\n\nSo, at the end of our dining adventure, I left with mixed feelings about La Folie. I liked the food: it was tasty, creative, and the complimentary hor doeuvres were a nice touch. But the experience with the cold, snobby hostess has colored my perceptions of La Folie. I would understand if the dining room was full,and the only option was to sit at the worst table in the whole place..but this wasn't the case. The restaurant was empty when we entered, and was only half-full by the time we left at 8PM on a Saturday. The snobby blonde hostess should know this basic fact: fine dining is not just about the quality of the food; it is also about the quality of the service. To that end,  my boyfriend and I will not be dining at La Folie anytime soon.", "author": "Linda N."}

I also tried the curry crab panna cotta appetizer which was a new and interesting but delicious dish. the cream of asparagus soup was yummy and beautiful, it came in a dish with an asparagus spear and a quail egg, and then the waiter poured the soup on top at the table. \n\nAnd then I had the lobster tail in butter, really good, and then for dessert i had the huckleberry baked alaska with huckleberry panna cotta and  it was the most delicious dessert i have ever had in my life, without a doubt. it was a miniature baked alaska, not a slice, with huckleberry ice cream surrounded by toasted whisps of meringue. \n\nThey have an extensive wine list and also have caviar service and you can add shaved truffles to any dish, although we did not have caviar or truffles.

The food here emphasizes richness (think: liberal use of heavy cream) over flavor and quantity over presentation. The waitstaff were extremely attentive and polite, but made us feel awkward because they kept on asking us how things were going while we were in the middle of conversing intimately.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-24", "description": "Okay, so this is really a 4.5 based on me not feeling quite at home in an 'old money' establishment (although if that implies new money, or indeed any money on my part, I am misleading you) and my sense that one could probably have an equally delightful meal at a less expensive establishment (I was $320 poorer after picking up the tab for two). That said, there ain't a lot to fault. \n\nI took my boyf to La Folie a couple of weekends ago to celebrate an unexpected work bonus. I was curious to see the interior given the way it is shielded from the outer world. The decor was a little odd - a touch of 70s perhaps - but it wasn't really a detractor from the experience. \n\nTo me, one of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is that the waitstaff are incredibly attentive without ever being obtrusive, and that was certainly my experience at La Folie. We kicked things off with a $15 glass or crisp rose champagne, then moved into the menu ($70 for three courses, $85 for four I think).  We got all the advice we wanted when we asked for it. The sommelier swung by moments after we'd asked for some vino advice. The food itself was whisked out promptly and was quite splendid. I started a dungeoness crab napoleon with a citrusy sauce (the latter being on the side thankfully, as it was a little overpowering). My boyfriend had the pigs feet terrine (seriously, would I make such a thing up?) which he seemed to enjoy, although I'll admit the texture wasn't what I was looking for. \n\nWe then moved on to mains. My choice was an exquisite stuffed squab and quail wrapped in potato strings with truffles shaved over the top. It really was heavenly. My boyf plumped for the LIberty Farms duck breast which he enjoyed immensely.\n\nWe rounded things out with one dessert (a chocolate concoction ordered by my boyfriend and quite tasty)  and one cheese plate (my pick and an absolutely delicious one at that). Was there dessert wine? I  can't remember, due to the fact that La Folie has a decent selection of half-bottles of wine, makinng it all too easy to order a half-bottle of white followed by a half-bottle of red.

Chef Passot stopped at our table and graciously chatted with us (well, with me in french). This was a huge splurge for us, so may have to wait for actually getting the Masters Degree to go there again. I chose having the five courses at $100 and it was almost more than I could handle, but I wanted to try as much as possible not knowing when I'd be able to afford to return. My boyfriend also ordered five courses and was stuffed at the end. And he's a big man with a big appetite! I loved the fact that our server did NOT tell us his name. He was gracious, discreet, yet attentive. Very much a server in the European way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-07", "description": "Wow. My wife and I have a new favorite in S.F. La Folie is in Russian Hill amongst a bunch of other restaurants. It's a great area except that there is NO parking! After driving around in vain for 30 minutes looking for a spot (on a Monday evening), we broke down and went with the $15(!) valet. \n\nThe dining room was rather intimate but quite elegant and luxuriously appointed. It was reminiscient of Gary Danko but with more warmth. The menu is set up like Gary Danko as well where you can choose three, four, and five course meals (if not partaking from the tasting or the vegetarian menus)...you can also create any combination you want.\n\nWe were gifted with three(!) amuse bouches...all quite nice. The first was a miniature lobster \"salad\"  with microgreens, tiny slices of tart apples, and a few pomegranate arils. Yum. The next were lollipops of house-cured salmon pinwheels with seasoned cream cheese served in a special \"lollipop holder\"...I wonder if this was Chef Roland Passot's response to Thomas Keller's ice cream cones (cornets with tuna tartare and creme fraiche)? Anyways, the freebie parade continued with a slow-poached organic egg yolk with cream and essence of bacon (elegantly served in a \"topped\" egg shell.). What an awesome way to start the meal.\n\nMy wife opted for the vegetarian tasting menu and went for five courses ($85). She started with a special of the night...a Roasted Musquee de Provence (Pumpkin) Soup with chestnut confit and spiced marshmallow. This was decadently rich and perfectly seasoned. I started with the playfully-named \"Tasting of Passot Roe\"...a trio of flavored roes with dashi poached Monterey abalone, tuna carpaccio, and cured sardine with cucumber. I could appreciate the thought behind this dish, but it was not a favorite of mine...the sardine really overpowered the roe and the tuna frankly did not taste fresh. The abalone was great but I could have gone for more than one paper-thin slice. \n\nNext up for my wife was a roasted fall vegetable and Asian pear salad (stacked like a Napoleon) with spiced walnuts and a Banyuls vinaigrette. This was beautifully presented and delicious. I had the butter poached lobster on butternut squash ravioli, celery root & apple salad with truffle beurre fondue. The lobster was sinfully rich and tender, the ravioli was the perfect accompaniment, while the celery root and apples were the perfect foil.\n\nOur next dishes were a wild mushroom and leek risotto with mushroom truffle broth, and a roasted Arctic char, sweet onion fondue, salsify, bacon and Brussels sprouts, and lobster bordelaise. While my wife loved the simplicity and clean flavors of her dish, I found it to be a little underseasoned. My Arctic char, however, was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and presented. The caramelized Brussels sprouts with tender bits of smoky bacon were a revelation.\n\nWe concluded the savory portion of our menu with a composition of roasted winter vegetables and  \"Le Boeuf\" ($15 supplement) consisting of a seared filet mignon, braised beef short rib, and a burger Rossini with sauce Bordelaise. OMG. The filet was perfectly seared and crusty with a nice crunchy sprinkling of fleur de sel and was oh so tender. The short rib was decadently rich and falling apart. The burger was the piece de resistance...a very upscale slider. It was a thick coin of juicy seared meat stuffed with foie gras topped with a little slice of tomato and glazed by a rich sauce with shavings of truffles. My wife loved her dish, but after what I was presented, I had no interest in tasting her veggies.\n\nAt this point, despite being on the verge of a food coma, we pressed on with desert. My wife had the Kobocha pumpkin cr\u00e8me caramel torte with Kobocha sponge cake, gingersnap cookie, and Cajeta caramel gelato (with a touch of salt). I had the Huckelberry Baked Alaska with huckleberry and cr\u00e8me fraiche ice cream, a green tea cookie, and a chocolate petit fours. These were both great, but we had finally reached our limit of what we could shovel down our throats. As such, we had to take our mignardises \"to go\"...tacky I know, but at least we refrained from licking our dishes. \n\nThe food that evening was consistently inventive and skillfully prepared. The large portion sizes were a pleasant surprise at such a high-end restaurant. Finally, the service was fantastic. Our waiter seemingly effortlessly navigated around the entire (small) dining room, but we never lacked for anything. He was knowledgeable and patiently explained each dish. What was most impressive was that the service was attentive but not stifling. Chef Passot even kindly came out to chat with each table...what a nice touch. It's hard not to compare this dinner with another recent \"high-end\" adventure we had in Utah at La Caille, especially since both dinners cost about the same. But whereas we left La Caille feeling violated (and in need of a hug), La Folie was a bargain!", "author": "Jason K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-30", "description": "The reason that I do not give La Folie a higher rating was more due to service and expectations but not due to the FOOD which was GREAT.  \n\nI will start off with comments on the lower notes of the evening.  The hosts at the front seemed friendly and inviting enough but it felt forced and not necessarily genuine.  We were sat in the back room which was colored green and I guess I prefer warmer or neutral colors to my eating environment.  Our table was next to the door which connected their bar and lounge to the dining area.  It also happened to be where the sommelier retrieved the wine so opening and closing of the door happened more often than I would have preferred.  It was not necessarily intrusive but noticeable nonetheless.  Also, the corner table where we sat felt a little cramped.  I will note that although I was initially dissatisfied with the table, I was much happier to be sat in the back room while leaving the restaurant.  This is due to the noise level in the main dining room which was loud.\n\nThe wait staff brought a similar presence and energy as the front hosts.  They were friendly but I never got into a comfortable groove with them.  They were helpful but not interactive in a way that enhances my experience.  When I asked about the $55 wine pairings for our 5-course meals, the waitress informed us that the wine served with the pairings was only off the by-the-glass menu.  It was told in a way that made the wine pairing option seem deficient and that the sommelier would not responsibly pair wines with our food.  It also felt like I was getting backed into a more expensive wine service (*Although, this did not appear to be so when the bill arrived.  So I may not have paid any additional amount anyways).  Admittedly, I am a wine neophyte so I depend heavily on the sommelier to pair wines with my food.  The sommelier himself was a very nice gentleman who reminded me of a kind French grandfather.  I may have interacted with him better had I known a little more clearly how much the wine service would have cost.  It would have eased some of my discomfort.  Additionally, I am used to fine dining establishments pairing wines with the amuse bouche which did not happen here.  I realize this is added cost to the restaurant but it is these little things that make me feel like I received value for my spent money.  \n\nI will have to say that the food at La Folie ranged from good to excellent.  The 2 amuse bouche were not very memorable and probably could have been left out of the meal.  Although I might have felt differently had I gotten some wine to enjoy with it.  My wife and I both eschewed the soups and salads and started with the seared foie gras.  This was excellent and clearly the best foie gras we have ever had.  My next course was the snails which were very good, though I wish the bone marrow was a little more present and the snails a little more buttery.  My wife had the branzino which was only good.  Tasting the ahi amuse and the branzino made me think that fish is not La Folie's strong suit.  Our next course was the butter poached lobster which was excellent.  Each component of the dish really made the dish as a whole sparkle.  My last savory course was the trio of beef while my wife had the venison.  Initially my tenderloin was overcooked and had to be sent back.  I did not expect to finish this course due to being nearly full but once I got started I could not stop.  The tenderloin was perfect on the second go around and the Burger Rossini was outstanding although the lettuce and tomato on it could have been replaced by mushroom and sweet onions.  The short rib turned out to be too salty though the meat was soft.  My wife's venison was very good but I felt it could have been sliced more thinly when served.  The farro risotto it came with was amazing.  Finally for dessert, my baked Alaska was very good while my wife's cheese souffl\u00e9 was excellent.  The fromage blanc sorbet with the sesame tuile that accompanied the souffl\u00e9 made me want a bigger portion. They finished us off by presenting and packaging petit fours for us to conclude our meal.\n\nIf the service had better synergy, La Folie would have received 5-stars or at least 4.5-stars.  Unfortunately, it only got very close to meeting my expectations though never threatening to exceed them.  For a nearly $400 dinner, I want my expectations at the very least met but hopefully exceeded.", "author": "Ben A."}

I had the 4 course and he had the 5 course.   We were uncomfortably full at the end of dinner - probably should have downgraded to the 3 course.   \n\nMy picks were the crab salad on cauliflower panna cotta, butterfish, the quail and sqaub, and the cheese souffle.  the crab salad was great - light and refreshing, nice flavors.  likewise, i really enjoyed the butterfish - the uni, carrot, ginger sauce it came with was fantastic and the fish was cooked very well.  by this time, i was starting to get full but i soldiered on with the squab and quail.  i thought it was a clever presentation being wrapped in potato strings and the meat was tender and juicy but i just found the dish not that memorable. cheese souffle was very good but a little bit rich to end the night.  \n\nHe got the pig's feet, lobster, sweetbreads terrine, the foie gras on toast, the black bass, lamb chops, and bread pudding.  the pig's feet was good but we had a hard time figuring out what meat was what.. not sure if that was the point.  i thought the frisee with mustard on top was a nice touch.  The foie gras was great - glad I was able to try it but like many have mentioned, its super rich...a couple bites of it did it for me.  i thought the black bass was good - I probably liked the fish itself better than my butterfish although I think the overall presentation of my fish was better.  Lamb chops were excellent but again, nothing memorable.  the bread pudding was great though, wish i had ordered that instead of the cheese.  \n\nservice was great throughout - not sure how many forks and knives we went through, but it was a lot.  water glasses constantly filled, no complaints here.  Atmosphere was a little weird.  We were in the back room which was nice at first to start a quiet meal, but after awhile it felt too quiet.  Would have prefered to sit in the front of the restaurant where there seemed to be a lot more action.  \n\nIn sum, definitely a place to try on a special night.", "author": "Julie G."}

The second is dining room is brightly lit, and a touch ornate with a very high ceiling. \n\nMy favorite part about their menu was the foie gras which is the best and coincidentally also the largest (is bigger better?...supersize my foie baby!) i've tasted at a restaurant in SF. My least favorite was the butternut squash soup that was death by cinnamon. All the other stuff was very good, but not etched in memory.\n\nThe service was very friendly, but not top notch like you'd expect for paying top dollar.

The 3rd course was seared Foie Gras done up in fancy pants, apple broth atop brandy dots. Sadly it was lackluster & failed to impress my t-buds. The 4th course was Filet Medallions, Bbq Shortribs & strangely enough an undercooked mini slider topped with Foie Gras....IDK about you but when I'm dropping ducats for french cuisine the LAST thing I wanna see on my plate is a FrEAkn hamburger, appalled & tasteless I gave it away. I must admit the bbq shortrib was the best I've ever had & thats saying alot coming from a texan!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-27", "description": "I had heard portion sized were quite large.  My boyfriend scoffed, saying that \"we were out, might as well try as much as we can.\" Oh, those words would come back to haunt him/us...\n\nI had:\n\nOyster amuse bouche - The creme fraiche sauce was a little bland and boring. Moving on...\n\nCauliflower soup with oyster flan and caviar - Quite possibly my favorite dish of the evening. The oyster flan struck the perfect balance of saltiness to the soup without providing an overwhelmingly \"fishy\" taste. They used a very appropriate oyster in preparation [while I feel those used in the \"Oysters with Pearls\" during my last trip to Per Se (re: a Thomas Keller signature dish) were overwhelmingly strong in an otherwise delicate presentation]. The cauliflower soup was rich and creamy, yet did not feel overwhelmingly heavy. The caviar accent provided a lovely textural contrast.\n\nQuail and foie gras lollipops with leek and wild mushroom cannelloni - Another lovely dish; however, in excess. The dish was presented with three stuffed quail legs/three cannelloni. The quail was cooked perfectly, and the creamy foie gras paired excellently with it. I could have lived with a single leg, however. There was a small supplement fee for this item.\n\nSturgeon on braised leeks with crispy potenta gateau and oxtail, red wine thyme reduction - The sturgeon, again, was perfectly cooked, though the leeks were pretty overpowering. In contrast, the polenta/oxtail was very, very good - the flavors and textures worked perfectly together. I didn't feel like they matched well on the plate, however. The size of this dish was much better; though, at this point of the meal, I was already full.\n\nRabbit (loin, rack, braised leg) with baby vegetables, roasted garlic, natual jus - Holy Mary Mother of God... this dish could NOT have been any larger. I think Little Bunny Foo-Foo was on steroids, frankly, as I've never seen a larger rabbit leg before (think turkey leg sized). The leg, stuffed with wild mushrooms, was my favorite preparation. Again, cooked perfectly. The loin, stuffed with vegetables, was very good - but, again, three large pieces were in excess. The little rack, while \"cute,\" was a little more work than it was worth. The sauce was a little on the salty side - though I'm a sald addict, even I noticed (the bf had made an earlier comment about his dishes, particularly the truffle butter sauce for one dish, being exceptionally salty). The vegetables were rather forgetable... and I frankly don't think I could have eaten them even if I wanted to do so.\n\nLime and Mint refresher - Light and served it's purpose.\n\nLe Coco et La Passion (passion fruit sorbet, basil infusion, and coconut tulle) - The sorbet, by itself, was a bit strong for my liking. The basil infusion, by itself, boring. The coconut tapioca, again, nothing to write home about. All together they were quite refreshing and had a lovely lair of flavors and textures. However, AGAIN, the portion could have served four people easily. I left the vast majority in my bowl.\n\nWe asked the sommelier to do wine pairings, as we were having particularly contrasting menus (think quail/foie gras vs. goat cheese tartin). They were very reasonably priced. That's my only highlight for them, however. I can't speak for the bf, but my wines did not pair particularly well with my courses.  Live and learn.\n\nThe service was friendly, but left a little to be desired, as there was a lot of \"reaching over\" and awkwardness. For instance, as the soups were delivered, the server spent an unusually long period of time trying to figure out which soup was which. The first wine flight came out when we were almost done with our first dish (though they were brought timely from here on out). Certainly not on par with service in the city's other fine dining establishments, unfortunately.\n\nWe both left feeling stuffed to the gills - certainly not a \"normal\" feeling for me when I leave a fine dining situation. In that aspect, my Depression era grandfather would have at least been pleased. I'm a big boy and can \"pack it in\" with the best of them, but rather than enjoying and savoring all the dishes, the eveing became more of a \"food marathon\" than anyhing else. Like running another hill at mile 20, we'd ealize that we still had more dishes ahead of us. In the end, after arriving home, we spent the next two hours curled on the couch watching \"Six Feet Under\" reruns while we allowed our bodies time to digest so that we could actually go to bed comfortably.\n\nWould I return? I'm not clammering to go back, though I'm certainly not opposed to it - afterall, the food was very good. Wine/service... eh. If I chose my own wines and did a three course (if chosing lighter dishes MAYBE even doing three savory and splitting a dessert), I think it'd make for a more pleasing experience.", "author": "Jesse H."}

Wifey's consisted of dungeness crab, sturgeon and bread pudding.  Mine was duck breast slices, foie gras, salmon, three types of beef, and a plate of three cheeses (dessert).  between the two of us we had 2 glasses of rose, 2 glasses of cab, and a glass of courvoisier napoleon.  in between my illness and digestion, i'm still recovering as i sit in bed and type this out.\n\nhonestly when the first course (duck breast slices) was brought out it was so pitifully small that when my dish was unveiled i almost burst out laughing.

At first I was a little concerned when I called to make my reservation. The only Sat. time they had was 9:15 pm, which was late. I asked them to call me if anything was to open up. I got several calls and my time was changed to 8:15, an hour earlier which I thought was great service for not have even stepped a foot in the door yet. I felt liked they really cared to please me, which to me is priceless. \n\nI arrived early at about 6:45pm. The power was out for two city blocks so it was dark, but the small oil lamps (on the tables) were lit, and we could see somewhat. We were seated immediately. I was stunned at the superb service, even in the dark, the staff adapted quickly to the inconvenience, Tre bien!   I have never in my life had service this well at any restaurant. We got a table and the service staff brought more small oil lamps to our table, and I must say, it was a very romantic setting for my first date.  Some people thought it was inconvenient, we thought it was really fun and romantic to order holding a candle. Despite the darkness, the staff was impeccable, very polite, very apologetic about the situation. \n\nHearing the chef's specials (which sounded delicious) we ordered our food. After ordering and a few sips of wine, the lights came back on. I was hoping that they would stay off!  We were first surprised when the chef had sent out a special dish for us to try at no cost. A poached egg, with a strip of toasted bread. It was very good, creamy, and had me excited to see what was to come next.  I Started with \"Tasting of Passot Roe\" which was delicious and presented beautifully. Very fresh tasting, not too fishy, I was extremely impressed. I then had the frog legs \"Bernard Loiseau\". It was delicious. The legs were tender and cooked perfectly. The sauce was very good. The puree it came with I thought tasted a little too \"froggy\" but not bad. Next, the Burgundy snails. I have seen snails served before in the shell, but never had them. The chef presented this dish exquisitely, shell less, and cooked to perfection. Go to their website and they have photos of the dish. I recommend this delicacy. My final dish was the \"Le Boeuf\" tenderloin, Short rib, and burger. Incredible!! Hands down the best Filet I have had in a very very long time. All of the beef was tender, and of excellent cut. I would have to say the meal was almost better than sex, its a toss up! The entire meal the wait staff was always refilling the wine and sparkling water, very polite, professional, five star quality even in the dark! It was unbelievable. \n\nOverall, the experience and the meal was perfect. It will be very hard for any french restaurant to compete with this place. I highly recommend this place to anyone. La Folie is perfection, elegant, professional, and very polite. The entire staff went out of their way to make my dining experience wonderful. The chef is amazing, a true professional.

If you like game birds, they don't come better than this.  We shared the desserts: a late summer berry mille feuille and a peach baked Alaska (they called it something else).

We even went here to celebrate the day I proposed to her.  It's always been 5 stars in my book.  And yet, last night we went there with my family and...it was an uneven experience.  It wasn't horrible by any means and calling it even near-average is insulting.  All the highlights were still there...the flavors are still as delicious as compared to the few times we'd been there before.  And snails in bone marrow...I can't resist it anytime we come here.  So what was wrong?  Well...the scallop dish was...one scallop.  One small scallop.  My mom had ordered it and well, I couldn't get over that one of her courses was one piece of scallop.  Also, it took a LONG time to get the second course and there were no updates on what was happening.  Maybe these sound like nitpicks but honestly, this was my FAVORITE restaurant and one that I thought was near perfect.  So yes, still great but I'm knocking it down a star.  I hope to revise it upwards on our next visit...!", "author": "Francis S."}

Wish they didn't have the long banquette seating along the wall though, which I'm personally not a fan of... someone inevitably ends up staring at the wall (or their companion, which may or may not be good thing).  Tables, especially on the banquette seating, are close together so you can hear the next tables' conversations.  Wouldn't be too bad if you get lucky and sit next to someone who has the real scoop...

Took my chica there for her birthday.  This is truly a special occasion restaurant - there were 3 anniversary and 3 birthday celebrations at the tables surrounding us.  The crowd was definitely mixed, so I wouldn't say this is only for the older set.  The service was excellent - from the waiter to the sommelier to the bus boys - all superb.  They were very helpful in explaining the dishes and wine.  Even the chef was delightful.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't full at 8pm on a weeknight, so they asked if we wanted a table in the middle of the room or a banquette.  We opted for the banquette.  But if you want to request the best table, go for one of the 2 window tables or a corner table in the back.  \n\nAs for the food, it was the best dining experience we've had in a long time.  I had the Summer Tasting Menu which consisted of 5 courses - foie gras 2 ways, duck egg, veal with sweetbreads, cheese with honeycomb, and a chocolate bombe with cherry soup.  Everything was just wonderful.  The only thing I didn't care for was the extreme richness of the dessert, but I also don't like chocolate either.  My gf's  dinner was equally delicious - corn soup with lobster, warm pig feet, lamb, and Strawberry Baked Alaska.  The Baked Alaska was simply divine.  I ate 1/2 her dessert even though I was busting at the seams some time around the veal plate.  The 3 complimentary amuse-bouches were lovely too - chilled cantaloupe soup, duck egg, and cardamom pudding.  For the birthday, they brought out a plate of petit fours with a candle and Happy Birthday sign made out of chocolate.  There were mini Madeleines and some very tart, but very yummy passion fruit jelly squares.  I am actually salivating thinking about all this!\n\nThe timing in between each dish was perfect.  Didn't think we had to wait too long for anything.  After all, this isn't an eat 'n run type place, it's meant to be a food marathon.  We weren't expecting to be stuffed here, but we probably would have been satisfied with the 3-course menu.  We wanted to try as much as we could though.  Overall, our experience here was just lovely.  Definitely a restaurant to keep in mind for the next special occasion.", "author": "Cianne M."}

I asked for a special table and we got one right in front by the windows.  I selected the spring tasting menu and after the second course, I was stuffed! The portions are so large. I guess because they had two amuse bouches to start with, which were pretty generous in size. My foie gras soup (yes a soup) was a soup and it's own seared piece!! I felt like I barely touched my plate until the cheese plate came out. It had a ooey piece of honeycomb! I saw honeycomb all over Italy, but didn't try it with cheese - lemme tell you, it's delicious!!! Then I had the sushi rolls which were yummy. My bf had the vegetarian menu with an addition of lobster. I think La Folie loves asparagus and wild mushrooms because a lot of our dishes had them in it.

We were seated promptly, as soon as our party arrived. \nAmbiance - the restaurant has a wonderful \"easy\" vibe, it is not stuffy, as some French restaurants of this caliber can be, you hear a lot of laughter, smiles everywhere; it's nicely decorated, and feels 'warm'. \nService - extremely professional, yet friendly, unobtrusive and the folks were not snobby at all\nFOOD and Presentation - AMAZING on both accounts.  Foe gras, lobster, lamb, snails in bone marrow, chocolate desert - all done with perfection and worth every penny.  I won't go into more detail because I believe the previous reviewers covered this well.  \nIt is also worth mentioning that if you happen to arrive early for dinner, the Lounge next door makes very good cocktails and has a great selection of high end liquor (and, Bartender is Great!).  \n\nThank you La Folie for an unforgettable experience.  \n\n\nPS - V Parking is a huge plus, given the area (ie - chances of finding parking on your own on a Saturday night are very very remote).", "author": "Laura K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-12", "description": "I rarely eat out at restaurants because I'm on a very restricted diet due to food sensitivities. The chef and staff at La Folie were wonderfully kind and accommodating to me.\n\nThe first time I ate there, I had emailed to the chef in advance the list of foods I can't eat. He came out to discuss what he might cook for me and it was great to watch this exceptionally capable and kind man, Chef Roland, think through the alterations he would make to various recipes. The meal that followed was such a gift to me because the dishes were complex in taste and texture.  (When confronted with my restricted diet, other restaurants have just prepared very simple dishes).\n\nThe second time I ate there, for my husband's birthday, I had emailed the chef some selections from the online menu that looked good to me.  For one of the dishes I picked, the goat cheese tatin, I couldn't eat most of the ingredients, but I asked the Chef anyway to try and make an alternate version for me and suggested perhaps using nuts to replace the cheese. I was delighted and astounded with the alternate version that Chef Roland made.  Seared sturgeon and a very young beet and some other beets with horseradish foam.  The inside of the sturgeon was like a very mild, firm cheese. This may sound strange, but after several years on this restricted diet, my mind and palate will make such connections to foods that I can no longer eat.  \n\nThe rest of the meal was wonderful as well, but I bring up this sturgeon dish because I had basically asked Chef Roland to do the impossible and he really listened to me and delighted my taste buds with his response!  This was a very rare gift.", "author": "Holly L."}

We got a window seat table which is pretty nice, Chef Passot actually stopped by our table and asked whether we like the food. This is our first time here and we wanted to try out variety of dishes, hence we ordered 10 courses total just for two of us (my husband and I). We ordered the corn soup, abalone & uni, tasting of Passot roe, burgundy snails, day boat scallop, lobster risotto, le boeuf, souffle, baked Alaska, the summer berry dessert from the tasting menu. Our top three are the snails, steak in the le boeuf and the corn soup. The Snails are outstanding, rich flavor from the bone marrow, but at the same time not over powering the snail flavor. the steak from the Le Boefu was melt in your mouth, pair well with the sauce. The corn soup is very delicate with the squash blossom and lobster. The chef seems to like foam a lot. a lot of our dishes have some sort of foaming in it. The plating of the dishes are definitely a piece of art. Every single one of the dishes definitely wow you for sight first. I tend to like to try souffle from restaurants for dessert, because not many restaurants have souffle on the dessert menu and there are definitely some technical elements in making a good souffle. I would say their souffle is pretty good, however, they put some bacon bits on top, I know pretty much all Americans love bacon, including me, but I think the bacon is a bit overpowering the flavor of the souffle. Anyhow, we enjoyed our meal, great food, may go back and try some other dishes - I saw a lot of people ordered the duck egg.", "author": "Kalu C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-19", "description": "Thank you, gods of food, for making La Folie my Aunt's birthday restaurant of choice, thus allowing me the chance to eat at a restaurant that I would never have gone to because (a) I'm poor and (b) classic french is not for poor people.  \n\nNow, I am not a fan of classic french and if I were, I'd give this place a heartfelt 5 stars.  Instead, I'm giving it a 4.5 stars for its impeccable service, perfectly cooked and plated food, and fancy decor, but I'd never go back there again unless someone paid for me (anyone? anyone?) simply because of the heavy sauces, meaty food, overly buttered goods, i.e. classic french cooking.\n\nWe had two amuse bouches, 4 courses, a palate cleanser, and a plate of petit fours.  The actual courses were surprisingly large (my boyfriend's fois gras was like an entire liver, hopefully not human) and they did not make them smaller if you got more than 3 courses which I thought was very cool.  The plating was exquisite, you know like quail eggs poached cut in the shape of daisies, foams, sushi rabbit rolls, squab wrapped in shoestring potatoes, etc. etc., you know,  things that you feel like saying: huh?  or: how the f. . .? or: is that necessary? - ah who cares, it tastes like heaven!  All in all, I'd recommend the scallop dish, the squab, the cheese plate, the rabbit 3 ways, the pig's feet, and the cassoulet.  No, I did not eat that all, but others did and mentioned these as highlights.  Non-highlights:  the lobster IF you're not a huge fan of lobster, the gateau IF you think it's going to be a floury cake (it's a gelatin like cake, i.e. I was pissed).  Finally, our amuse bouches were duck liver flan and some egg soup in the actual shell.  This all translates into: if you are a vegan or vegetarian, probably NOT you're best option for dinner.\n\nPersonally, I thought the service was awesome.  The waiters were very knowledgeable, and if they forgot something (like I think  they forgot to pour my cousin her coffee) they had a panic attack.  The busboys were also equally gracious and felt the need to walk you all the way to the bathroom if you asked where it was.  Slightly awkward, but nonetheless nice.\n\nThe decor was lovely but it was really . . . quiet.  At first, I felt like we couldn't speak in a tone louder than a whisper, but then I got drunk and didn't care and I'm pretty sure we were the loudest people in there. \n\nThe chef also came out and greeted our party, and he's quite personable in a non-frenchie way.\n\nSO, it feels strange to give a restaurant a 5 star rating when I'll probably never go back, but frankly, it just was stone-cold perfect in almost every department and giving it four stars would seem like a disservice.

Weirdly enough, I am describing a top-notch, Michelin-starred French restaurant, not a Korean barbeque house.  How odd, fancy-schmancy French restaurants are not supposed to really feed you.  Well, La Folie is a defiant one.  Due to large French portions, including a massive slab of seared foie gras, I literally could not move after dessert.  I just sat there, clearly out of it, ready to just pass out.\n\nLa Folie is a glutton's paradise.  We all decided on the 5-course menu to the chagrin of our uncorseted abdomens.  Add on the four intercessional courses (gratis), and you are reading the writings of a 9-course dinner survivor.  I am lucky to be here sorta back to my size.  From a brilliant carrot uni soup to an airy egg custard to tasty cardamom pudding and strawberry granita, each amuse bouche represents a thumbnail sketch of the gastronomic delight ahead.  The appetizers are stellar.  They offer the most scrumptiously flavorful Dungeness crab salad.  The seared scallop dish is great and the lobster bisque is just heaven.  For seafood, get the poached lobster.  Cooked to perfection, it arrives with plush pillows of butternut squash ravioli.  Bites of my friends' very good black cod and the signature Le Boeuf dish indicate that a finely prepared lobster is hard to beat.  The desserts do not disappoint.  The Valhrona milk chocolate passionfruit bombe comes with this gorgeously layered hazelnut dacquoise.  Paired with a scoop of black pepper gelato, you end up with the most fascinating array of flavors dancing in your mouth.  The chocolate fondant with Brandy-dried fruits is dark and boozy.  Finally, I cannot begin to describe how amazing the Kabocha pumpkin cake is.  Adorned by chocolate-oolong tea mousse, kabocha and caramel ice cream, and, one of my favorite fruits, crisply slippery Fuyu persimmons, words cannot describe how mouthwateringly delectable this work of art is.\n\nWith the help of the excellent sommelier, wine pairings do not get more exciting.  The Bordeaux and Rhone lists are impressive.  As it goes, the right wine can make bites explosively eye-opening and intriguing and, presently, all I can say is that I am intoxicated by French wine's powers.\n\nThe service is impeccable--attentive, knowledgable, and warmly courteous.  They presented me with an unexpected lovely birthday-inscribed cake and chocolate card.  Too kind!  As for the room, it is small, but elegant and warm.

It was like some kinda sweatshop, full of Mexicans, I saw huge open pots sitting on the floor (with some kinda soup in it) with no lid on, it didn't look very appetizing. The kitchen scene looked like the back kitchen of some dirt cheap places (while the min. is about $100 per person).\nFood - while the presentation looks nice, the taste was average.  I ordered the fish (with some fancy fish name), it tasted fishy.  The snails wasn't very tasty except the strong Pesto sauce all over it.  I can't remember anything exceptional out of the 5 courses I had.\nBy the way, we had to wait for an hour between the first and second course.  They finally speeded up the pace after we mentioned that we needed to leave by 10:30 (our reservation was at 7:30) just so that we didn't have to wait for an hour for each course.\nOverall: not worth the price or the value you pay.  Food is not bad, but I wouldn't spend over $100 on such things.  I'd recommend Gary Danke if you desire such fancy experience, at a slightly lower price as well.", "author": "Shanna W."}

The food, ambiance, and service were all outstanding.\n\nWe both had the 5 course menu with the Sommelier's Wine Pairing.  The wine pairings were perfect. The service was impeccable--the waitstaff was warm and friendly and every course was timed perfectly. \n\nThe dinner started with a pleasant surprise--2 amuse bouches: 1st, a vibrantly rich carrot and uni soup, followed by a delicious coddled egg in a cream of root vegetables.  I had the 1) Barbeque Squab with a Pistachio Crusted Foie Gras Torchon, Pomegranate Gastrique, Quince Compote; 2) Pig Feet, Sweetbread and Lobster Terrine on a Lentil Salad with Bacon, Hazelnut Vinaigrette; 3) Butter Poached Lobster on a Butternut Squash Ravioli, Toasted Almonds, Celery Root and Apple, Truffled Poultry Jus; 4) Seared Liberty Farm Duck Breast with Duck Confit \"Shepard's Pie\", Wild Hedgehog Mushrooms, Spiced Cider Jus; and 5) Chocolate Passion Fruit Bombe with Hazelnut Dacquoise.  My husband had 1) the Dungeoness Crab Salad; 2) Frog Legs with Frog Leg Flan, Wild Mushrooms, Parsley Coulis; 3) Slow Roasted Loch Duart Salmon, Braised Escarole, Parisian Gnocchi, Smoked Ham Hock, Sweet Onion Sauce; 4) Venison Loin; and 5) a Banana Tatin.  A palate cleanser of a granita on a cardamom foam was served between the meat course and the dessert course.  The dessert was presented with a candle and a chocolate card which read \"Happy Birthday\" for my husband.  And post-dessert, we had some petit fours.  EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious!  We HIGHLY recommend the pig feet/sweetbread/lobster terrine--probably one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life.  There was one small disappointment:  the ravioli with the lobster was overcooked, but since everything else was sublime, I'm not going to take away a star for that.  \n\nPortions at La Folie are very generous.  And we don't think that's a bad thing (unlike some other yelpers).  I did end up getting my dessert and petit fours packed up for home because I was so satiated from the previous courses.\n\nChef Roland Passot even came out to greet us at our table and asked how everything was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-11", "description": "I'll join the happy chorus. This place is amazing. 4 out of 5 of my courses were completely fantastic; one was \"merely\" very good. The dishes are thoughtfully conceptualized, beautifully prepared, and the portions are LARGE -  it's rare to see portions like this when the quality is this good. \n\nWe came for the foie, and I had both the torchon and the foie in peach broth. The torchon was fantastic and so big I could barely finish, and I thought maybe I had made a mistake ordering both; but when the foie with peaches came it smelled so phenomenal that I knew it wasn't a mistake, it was the greatest choice ever! That foie with peaches has got to be one of the top three restaurant dishes I've ever had.\n\nSpeaking of other restaurants -  La Folie is expensive, but it is actually a great value considering the quality of the food and what other top bay area spots cost. Come on, a five course meal of this quality for $95? Other places around here call it a tasting menu, don't let you choose what you get, and charge $50 more before wine. (La Folie does also offer a set multicourse tasting menu, which I haven't tried.)\n\nIt does take a while, which you want anyway because it's a lot of sumptuous food so you hardly want to rush.", "author": "C.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-22", "description": "Awesome!  Went here last week with my hubby for my birthday dinner.  I went to Fleur de Lys last year so I can't help comparing the two.  My first impression was that La Folie seems a lot smaller and less fancy.  That changed soon though as soon as I started putting food in my mouth!\n\nPart of the reason I was really looking forward to going here was that I heard that they give you huge pieces of foie gras and boy, was that right!  I was really jonesing for some so I started with the bbq squab and foie gras torchon.  That was very tasty (loved the squab too!) and a good size piece, but it looked like peanuts next to the monster sized piece I got for my second course...more foie gras! (the seared kind).  Granted, from the start, I kept hinting how much I loved foie gras and how I hear they give \"the biggest piece in the city\"...so sure enough, they gave me the biggest piece they had in the kitchen!  It was GINORMOUS!  About the size of an 8-10oz filet mignon and just as thick.  I though I might OD on foie gras...nah, I polished off that thing like it was nothing.  However, I was pretty much set for the rest of the night and it made the rest of the meal pretty anticlimactic.  Not that I minded...I got what I came for.  My hubby's seared scallop and pork belly was also extremely good (how can you not love pork belly)...but I was all about the foie and that was the highlight of my meal.  I guess this pretty much proved that I could never have have enough foie gras, ever!\n\nThird course, I got the trio of rabbit, which was also huge...I'm surprised that I still finished off most of it but I did get a break for a full course since I skipped the fish while my hubby got the lobster.   At least I had time to settle down a bit.  It was just ok (tasted like chicken), I think next time I'll stick to quail or duck at places like this.  I couldn't resist trying it though.  My hubby's veal covered in truffled sweetbreads was better so I ate some of that too.  I had a light lunch, but even I surprised myself at the sheer amount of food I ate.\n\nMy fourth course was a cheese course, so my hubby sat most of that one out while he recovered from the veal.  He did grab a couple bites of cheese.  I liked the semi-soft cheese (Comte) a lot, but my favourite was the melted cheese in the little dish (Epoisse?).  I also really liked the honey that came w/ the cheese platter.  The dessert course was actually a bit disappointing...I love a good warm chocolate cake, but one of my pet peeves is ice cream on top of the cake...it just makes the cake cool down and the ice cream gross and runny.  This one was actually inside the cake, not on top...but the effect was the same.  I still prefer my ice cream on the side and have them mix at the absolute last moment...in my mouth. :)\n\nWe got a hotel in the city so we got to do wine pairings for all 5 courses (plus champagne to start and go w/ the amuses).  The price is actually pretty reasonable ($55/5 courses).  The first couple pairings were very interesting but I got a bit bored after my third glass of fortified wine (french port-style fortified wine w/ the seared foie, madiera w/ the cheese, and another madiera w/ the dessert).  The pairings as a whole wasn't as inspired as pairings in other restaurants (partly due to the 3 very similar wines), but it was still a pretty good deal for the money.\n\nOne last comment is that the service was very good...our captain was friendly and warm, and she joked around w/ us a bit.  It was a lot more casual than Fleur de Lys, but still very attentive and made us feel taken care of.  Oh, and Roland Passot went out to greet us (Yay!), which is not something you usually see at most fancy restaurants unless you're a VIP (I'm still bummed that I didn't get to meet Ron Seigel at the Ritz).\n\nI would definitely come back here again for another giant piece of foie gras!

I'm serious. It was a short bread cookie with peach marmalade ice cream covered in baked meringue. It also came with a strawberry cookie with fresh diced peaches and a lemon biscuit with earl grey mousse.\nThen to cap off an amazing evening of food they gave us a tray of complimentary treats which consisted of madelines, caneles, strawberry gelees, and a chocolate praline petit four.\nMost delicious dinner ever. \nAfterwards we waddled home.

Truly one of the best meals I've had in my life. \n\nMy fiance and I both ordered the winter tasting menu with the wine pairing - it wasn't just a meal, it was an experience. We spent a good three and a half hours savoring every last bite and sip. After three amuse-bouches (including these lovely salmon \"lollipops\" that were almost too pretty to eat), our first course was a foie gras soup, with a side of foie gras, truffles and turnips. The flavors were incredible! The other standout course of the meal (4th course) was the venison, cooked to absolute perfection on a bed of brussel sprout leaves that were so light and well-seasoned. In addition, the wine pairings complemented all of the courses quite well.\n\nThe service was also amazing. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, but at the same time, gave us our space so we could savor every morsel of the glorious food at La Folie. She even went the extra mile to give us a copy of that night's tasting menu when she saw how obsessed we were with several of the wine pairings and wanted a refresher on what some of the wines were so we could get some to have at home. We also got to speak with Chef Passot when he made his rounds, and I was amazed by how humble he was, given that he is a veritable food god. When he asked if it was our first time dining there, my fiance casually remarked to him that the occasion that brought us to the restaurant was our celebration of our dating anniversary, and lo and behold, when it was time for the dessert course, a piece of delicious dark chocolate with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in perfect cursive in white chocolate was neatly positioned upright on each of our plates against the chocolate bombes.

This was a first for us - before last night it would have never even occurred to me to leave a restaurant mid-dinner!\n\nAgain, this is focused entirely on the food.  I am of the mind that a restaurant deserves a second chance if your service is bad, or your experience is bad, or even if the food is marginal.  But if you have two objective laid back diners both agreeing that each dish is painful to put down, I think you've got to re-evaluate what exactly you're doing there with your hard earned dollars. \n\nMy first \"salad\" course of roasted squab breast was basically four small clumps of  food on a plate.  A solitary tiny piece of squab, a small little pile of some cabbage, a little paper pouch with some stale chips in it, and a skewer with two foie gras hamburgers which were cold and repulsive.\n\nMy wife had the corn soup with had some eel and foie gras in it.  It was a bit overpowering on the corn element.\n\nThen came the second courses...\n\nMine:  The \"goat cheese tatin\" with roasted eggplant, artichokes, tomato confit, portobello mushroom, and sauce vierge.  Think of taking a bit of each, tossing it in a blender, bake it for a long time until it's totally dried out, stack it in a colum, and serve it.  The presentation was nice, but it tasted exactly like a cheap frozen pizza.  My wife tried it and it and she agreed - frozen pizza.\n\nHers (and the straw that broke the camel's back):  We felt they had mistaken her order when it came out.  This was the largest piece of foie gras I had ever seen.  It was actually obscene.  It looked like a quarter pounder size piece.  It was on top of some candied or aged balsamic vinegar fruit.  We think the menu said huckleberries but this tasted more like an apple or pear or something.  All on top of some bread-like substance covered in whatever was on the fruit.  She tried it.  Then I tried it.  It tasted like a combination of gummy candy (the fruit) and fruit loops (the bread like substance) with some tough meat in it (the foie gras.)\n\nWe spoke with the waiter.  To his credit, he was absolutely gracious and professional with us.  He couldn't have handled the situation with more class.  He asked us what we would like to do.  Bring the entree or not?  \n\nWe decided to leave and eat elsewhere.  Our bill included two appetizers (they didn't charge us for the tatin or foie gras), the corkage on our bottle of wine ($35), and the glass of sweet wine paired with the foie gras.  $97 total.  We were not asked to pay for anything that wasn't yet served.  The waiter asked for my business card for the chef to contact me. \n\nMany people with poor reviews recommend other comparable better restaurants.  This doesn't even fit in that category as I don't really know what the menu was even trying to be.  After walking out we both felt like we had just returned from an episode of the twilight zone.", "author": "Zack S."}

Oh my... speechless for this restaurant! We came here for my sister's bday, the resurant itself is really tiny. It only has 10 to 20 tables total. The decor is really classic and it gives u warm feeling. We sat down around 8 p.m., and we finished eating at 11. Their food are really delicate and cute, but they taste really bomb!! the waiters here are really nice, they will take your coat and hang it for you. It took us forever to figur out what to order, we were kinda taking our time too, just talking. The waiter was really patient and was trying explain everything on the menu. So six of us orderred 3 course per person. I got appetitezer, salad, and entree. The crab salad I had wad cold dish but really tasty. It has crispy on top and tofu's tenderness melt in ur mouth. And u would think salad, it's a whole big plate but no, the food was only as tiny as a butterfinger candy lol well I mean it's French. It's really cute. The restaurant gave us two dishes each person for free , they were also really tiny but elegant. And the most important thing is they taste bomb!!! The sear fio gras is the best here!!! Try it!! I'm soo in love wit it!! But I ordered snail instead it was really good too!! My main course was walu, prob the best one I've ever had!! It's sooo tensor and juicy, even tho I was super full and my dress was XX small that I couldn't breathe, I finished everything lol and their bday cake was really special! It wasn't like a big cake like we always see, but it was many different kinds of little tiny pieces of sweets. They were all very yummy ( I tried them all , can't resist)... Overall, best Frech food I've ever had!!! Def going back again!! If  I could I wana go everday!! Yummmm", "author": "Yoyo T."}

I almost felt like the flavors were meant to be enjoyed the way that orchestral music is meant to be enjoyed:  each note of flavor, and each ingredient is blended together to make a really beautiful biteful.\n\nThe chocolate fondant was so delicate and fine.  It was as if the pastry was prepared using dandelion puffs instead of whisks.\n\nThe service is warm, friendly, and polite, and every dish is presented beautifully, with a description of all of the ingredients and preparation.  I was really impressed with how knowledgeable our server was.  She was obviously inspired by the craftsmanship that was happening in the kitchen and was happy to tell us how the apple and potato chips were so amazingly thin (to the point that they were translucent).\n\nAt the same time, I felt like the whole experience was very approachable.

The portions are ridiculously small, the prices ridiculously high, and there are no flavors. I knew the price was high, and I can live with smallish portions but this was ridiculously small. And at least, what I expect when I put $100/person in a meal is some kind of fireworks for my palate or tastebuds. Nothing of this sort here. I have been to much better restaurants where I spent less in Beverly Hills (Los Angeles). \n\nI paid $15 extra for 'l'assiette de boeuf' and all I got was a 1cm diameter burger, a 1/2 inch cube short rib, and a 1/2 inch cube fillet. It was ok, but no better than any Los Angeles Steak house. The frog legs were tasteless, and even the accompanying sauces had nothing exciting. Curiously, the desserts were actually the best part of the meal. The little 'amuse-bouche' they bring in between plates were also bland (one spoon of sour-cream, one spoon of green onions, one spoon of raw red pepper...).\nThe place is loud and not intimate at all. I wanted to take my wife there for a romantic evening, but we could barely hear each other over the conversation of the neighboring table, which was only 5 inches from ours. We pretty much spent the evening listening to their conversation and not knowing whether to laugh or cry at the plates we were served. Big disapointment.", "author": "David K."}

La Folie in my opinion has some of the greatest French food in the country. This place puts Daniel in NYC to shame. At the moment my favorite French restaurant is Joel Robuchon, but La Folie is neck in neck with JR after my last visit. I ordered had the 5 course tasting menu. Everything that came out blew my taste buds out of space. It's all so different and creative. One of my favorite dishes has the be the \"Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Caramelized Peaches and Spiced Peach Consomm\u00e9.\" I am a foie gras addict. It's so delicious and so rich. My bf and I had to split it. Another one of my favorites was the \"\"Le Boeuf\", Creekstone Beef Tenderloin, Braised Beef Short Rib, and Burger Rossini with Sauce Bordelaise.\" The burger rossini was the most amazing \"burger\" I have eaten. If you can't afford French Laundry or a 6 course tasting menu at Joel Robuchon this place is just as good. Also come hungry because their portion's are very generous. Just an idea, my boyfriend and I both ordered the 6 course tasting menu but ordered different dishes. Half way through our dish we switched plates to taste all the delicious dishes they have to offer. Trust me they are generous. The service was also incredible. The second time we had dinner their, they had imported fresh truffles from France. I went a little overboard and had them add them to all my dishes. you can never get enough truffle.", "author": "Ruth K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-08", "description": "My approach to La Folie, like all expensive and upscale restaurants, is to consume everything I order because I want to get my money's worth.  On my first visit a few years back, this method sort of backfired on me because La Folie's portions are actually quite large.  I ended up throwing up in the restroom after my fourth course.  I've had similar disasters at other restaurants (see Cyrus), but am always up for the challenge.  On my latest visit, I noticed the portions were still large, but I was still determined to clean my plates.  After several belt notches loosened and zero trips to the restroom, I emerged victorious...\n\nFood:  5 stars.   My party was comprised of two guys and a girl.  The guys ordered the four course meal and the girl (ahem) ordered the five course meal.  For starters, the romanesque broccoli soup with lobster and pink peppercorn was broccolicious.  The goat cheese and fourme d'ambert terrine with baby pickled beets, toasted walnuts and frisee salad was pleasant, but paled in comparison with the seared hudson valley foie gras (generously portioned) and warm pig feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine.  The dungeness crab salad napoleon was good, but a bit incongruous with the rest of the rich items on the menu.  Next were the seafood courses, which were all quite good.  We had (listed in order of preference) the succulent and yummy butter poached lobster, beautifully seared mediterranean dourade on roasted artichokes, and slow roasted loch duart salmon on a cauliflower puree.  For the meat courses, we tried the trio of rabbit and the \"le beouf.\"   The best part of the trio of rabbit was the meaty braised leg, as the rack looked like five toothpicks with a thin veil of meat around them and the rabbit loin, wrapped around veggies, had a nasty skin on it that looked similar to the yellow skin on boiled chicken that is served during Chinese New Year.   The \"le beouf\" dish consisted of a trio of beef tenderloin, braised beef short rib, and burger rossini with truffle madeira sauce - all were quite good, especially the short rib.  Desserts were a nice ending to the meal.  I moaned with delight (to the horror of my friends) when I ingested the creamy, delicious warm Edam cheese souffle.  The bread pudding is also good, as is the \"Sunset\" if you are a chocolate-lover.\n\nService:  5 stars.   Service was very polished and professional throughout the night.  Our server seemed down to earth and was really helpful and spot on with his menu recommendations.  They all seem happy to be there, which makes a difference.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.   The interior has been renovated since my last visit to give it a more modern elegant feel and it's definitely an improvement.  The crowd is skewed towards middle-aged.  My only complaint is that the bar area is a bit cramped, which sucks if you're waiting for your tardy friends to show up.\n\nHits:  Seared hudson valley foie gras, butter poached lobster, \"le boeuf,\" warm edam cheese souffle.\n\nMisses:   Trio of rabbit, cramped bar area, parking sucks.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Fleur de Lys, Bouchon, Bistro Jeanty, Boulevard", "author": "Keith C."}

I might have chopped off a half a star for the ambiance - the space was as unexciting as it gets - but I add back the extra half star for the exquisite food presentation - every course was a work of art on the plate.  The escargot was served in a bone on a sea of vivid green foam - it visually knocked my socks off.  The rabbit main course was served in three meat portions alongside a beautiful long row of veggies that was built to resemble an enchanting, elaborate fairy-tale garden - just stunning.  I can also recommend the asparagus soup, cheese souffl\u00e9 (a dessert light as air) and baked Alaska.  The lamb main course was too rare for my taste, and served as a big hunk of meat - it was the one dish that lacked finesse, in my humble opinion.

He first fooled me with another restaurant nearby before disclosing this place.  When we walked inside we were shocked by the warm greeting from the hostess and crowds of waiters in suit.  From outside, it didn't look to be such a place!\n\nWe were seated in the private dining room for a quiet and romantic intimacy.    The decoration was green and purple, our most favorite combination.  The ceiling with 2 skyline windows and also the ceiling lamp matched well with the French paintings and leave-style sconces on the wall.\n\nBecause we saw the chef cooking that night, we had to order something special.  It took us 15 minutes to finally decide what we would like to order.  After placing the order, our waiter brought us 2 free appetizers, 1 more than regular 1-star restaurants.  They were cold sweet pea soup and the contemporary version of oeuf mollet.  They were very delicious and delightful.  Bf's menu included Dungeness Crab Salad, halibut, and peach ice cream and earl grey tea mousse.  The presentation of salad and halibut wasn't very fancy compared with others. But Bf liked his choices very much.  I ordered the \"Tasting of Passot Roe\"and Kona Kampachi  as appetizer.  It was a combination of 3 different types of food.  All of them were light and great for summer night.  For entree, I happened to order their famous R\u00f4ti of Quail and Squab stuffed with Mushrooms, Wrapped in Crispy Potato Strings, and Natural Jus with Truffles.  Bf ordered additional fresh black truffles from Southern France to this dish.   It cost $15 more but there were quite many thin pieces of truffles on the quail. The fresh truffles definitely added stronger flavor to the quail. The deboned and skinless quail was stuffed with white mushroom and cut into a few pieces to serve.  It was sauteed in the traditional source.  The cutest part was the onion basket with a tiny egg yolk pancake.  I had quail in Fleur de Lys and they were completely two different styles with great taste, a creative style vs. the traditional version.\n\nMy dessert was the Valhrona Milk Chocolate Passion Fruit Bombe with Hazelnut Dacquoise, Black Pepper Gelato. The dark chocolate was so smooth and the black pepper gelato tasted a little black pepper but wasn't spicy at all. First time experience for black pepper ice cream was very special and pleasant.  Bf's peach ice cream and mousse cake was also exceptional.    In the end, our waiter brought us 4 dessert samples including our first choice, dark chocolate with gold foil.\n\nThe food was great but the service was at higher satisfaction level.

I think cauliflower is underrated as far as vegetables go which is too bad because it is divine when made well. The lobster gelee on top of the cauliflower had good texture, and the lobster meat below the cauliflower was sweet, tender, and juicy. \n\nThe scrambled egg with cream, truffles, and pepper was yummy but not extraordinary. I think a little bit more salt would have helped.\n\nI really enjoyed my duck and oxtail consomme. It was served with smoked Liberty Farm duck breast, foie gras tortellini, and enoki mushrooms. This consomme was very hearty and flavorful but not perfectly clear. The duck breast was cooked rare and was delicious, fatty, and rich as were the foie gras tortellini.\n\nNext came a tasting of passot roe with crab and meyer lemon parfait and kona kampachi with radish&fennel salad and maine lobster. The lobster's texture was a bit mushy, but the overall flavors were good.\n\nI ordered the burgundy snails with castroville artichokes, and pernod lemon butter. The snails had good texture and I enjoyed the initial flavor, but ended with a sharp grassy flavor that I didn't quite care for. There was also a bit too much parsley. The artichokes were well cooked but a little underseasoned.\n\nThe goat cheese tatin with roasted eggplant, artichoke, tomato confit, and portabello mushrooms were pretty good. It was served with a sauce vierge. The veggies were slightly underseasoned. (I'm noticing the underseasoned vegetables thing -- is it me or them?)\n\nNext was the butter-poached lobster, butternut squash ravioli, celery root, apple, almonds, and truffled poultry jus. This was delicious. The lobster was tender, moist, and sweet. The texture and flavor was perfect. I won't even criticize them, and many other Michelin-starred restaurants whose dishes all seem to be a footnote to Thomas Keller's work. \n\nThe rabbit dish I had (loin, rack, and legs) with baby vegetables and roasted garlic was so beautiful to look at. The legs were juicy and tender. The loin was stuffed with roasted garlic (how can it be wrong?) and the rack was so tiny and cute that I don't remember what it tasted like.\n\nNext were the \"dessert\" courses -- cheese souffle with bacon custard (I enjoyed this), pumpkin cake with chocolate oolong tea mouse (I LOVED the persimmon ice cream that came with this), and various petit fours. \n\nThis was a beautiful evening, and I will definitely be back.", "author": "Felicity P."}

It surpasses the standard of a five star rating into something that can only be expressed as meteoric.  The menu is superb and the flavor compositions and presentation are something so exquisite that words cannot describe the transcendent experience that takes place with each mouthwatering morsel you daintily devour.  \nWe had the 5 course tasting for my 30th birthday, and it was breath-taking.  The most phenomenal dishes are the lobster (which comes in a mini-pumpkin that is edible), the snails (can only be described as mouth-melting indulgence), the scallops (best I have ever had), the duck (perfectly prepared), the crab salad (the most complex and unfamiliar taste and texture, something you must try), and the huckleberry meringue   tart (filled with the softest cake and basil ice cream) garnished with a mini cannelle  adorned with a single wishing candle, was the final food experience that sent me off into culinary heaven. \nThe chef, the wait staff, the ambience...this place is in a class of its own.", "author": "Brittany T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-15", "description": "Went to La Folie couple of weeks ago with another couple. Love the small size restaurant and tables are good sized. Best part is that it is NOT a noisy place - you can actually carry on a conversation with the person across from you. The food looks and tastes as good as it should - just as you imagine and read in these other reviews. I had the Dungeness Crab Salad with Cauliflower Panna Cotta. This was delicious and just the right amount as it was pretty rich. I love ordering food like this as I would not bother trying to prepare it myself. Next dish was the Black Cod. They were out of cod so they substituted (maybe Dorado?).  Cooked perfectly and the truffle gnocchi was terrific - cooked with just the right amount of chewiness (not too soft). Third course I had the Roasted Rack of Lamb. They served two large chops with butter beans. It was quite a bit so I brought one of the chops home. I order this at many restaurants and while I enjoy it, I can do as good a job myself so I wouldn't say this was the best I ever had. For dessert I had the Warm Edam Cheese Souffle. This was so good!  Would love to have this again for sure!  To sum it up:  The food was very good but not over the top. While our server was good, he wasn't great and felt that the service fell short for a restaurant of this caliber. You expect GREAT service at a place like this - not just good service. We felt that we spent an extraordinary amount of time waiting for our server for drinks, etc.  All four of us enjoyed the meal but the general outcome was:  \"Didn't knock our socks off\", especially for the money spent ($350 per couple with tip). It was a one-time visit for us.", "author": "Dorothy W."}

Excellent friendly and attentive service.  I don't quite understand the \"stiff\" service comments from other yelpers.  If you've experienced service in Europe, or rather the lack of service, don't expect that here.\n\nChef Passot came to our table to chat with us twice.  The sommalier was friendly and congratulated Jim C's (see: http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4TByNfzySEQ0K9nglTaJzQ ) and his wife, Ashley, on the future birth of their daughter.  The service from our waiter Quentin was excellent and never lacking.\n\nLa Folie is a great place for celebrating special events.  This evening was a belated anniversary celebration for me and my wife Lynette and belated farewell to our friends JIm and Ashley.  Honestly, great company can hide many of the shortcomings of a restaurant.  So I'll utilize a different rating system  (A, B, C) for what I expected to be a 5 Star restaurant experience overall.  \n\nAmbiance : B-\nFood:           B-\nService:       A\nParking:      B\n\nHere's the breakdown of my rating.  We were late by 40 minutes but called ahead stating we would be late due to the normal 101 Northbound rushhour coming up the Peninsula.  We had a reservation for 7PM, we valet the car and were seated immediately.  While we were not seated in the main dining room, I prefered the intimate and quite atmosphere of the back room for dinner.  The back room had recently been renovated in the first week of 2007.  The lighting is poor in the back room.  La Folie should get warmer lighting for this area or add more candles to the tables.  It was too dark to visually appreciate the meal because of the poor lighting.   \n\nThe food was good, however, not earthshattering.  Our party of four all tried different things.  The only item that was duplicated was the Seared Fois Gras.  My meal began with the Duck and Oxtail Consomme with Ennoki Mushrooms, 3 bite-sized pieces of Duck Confit, and a Fois Gras Ravioli.  I was disappointed the consomme was quite bland, not enough salt and not hot.  Next I had the Seared Fois Gras with a vinegrette sauce and huckleberries.  This was ok.  Decadently rich but not my favorite.  My final entree was the Venison Chop with Root Vegetables.  The Venison was very tender and not gamey,  However, there was not much flavor to the meat.  I was really hoping for a stronger complimentary sauce to accompany the Venison.  The roasted vegetables - potato, yams  mixed with roasted pears - were excellent.  I finished my meal with the Chocolate Caramel Fondant.  This was good but too rich to enjoy the whole thing.\n\nWe had a nice bottle of Burgandy (2003 Gevrey Chambertin Les Evocelles Domaine De La Vougeraie see: http://www.bbr.com/US/db/product/64460B/Gevrey-Chambertin-Les-Evocelles-Domaine-de-la-Vougeraie?ID=B0GCBBBW65R001B ) during our meal.  I would order this again. \n\nPros:\n+ Valet parking outside $15.00 added to your bill\n+ Extensive wine list\n\nCons:\n- valet parking did not have the car ready for us at the end of the meal.\n- we walked accross the street to pick up the car\n\nFinal recommendation:  Check out La Folie...", "author": "James G."}

Sure, it's not hip, it's not a place to see-and-be-seen, there's no buzz, no gimmick, no pizzazz. It's old school, old guard.\n\nWho cares when your food is this good. \n\nWe each had the 5-course for 90 bucks and stumbled away uncomfortable but elated.\n\nI said old-school, but this is not duck l'orange and coq au vin. These are beautiful flavor profiles that are original without resorting to Asian influences or molecular gastronomy.\n\nThere was an amuse bouche (pickled salmon) and in celebration of the season, black-truffled egg, served in the shell. Very cute.\n\nThe snails in puff pastry - how could one miss? And they didn't. The BBQ squab with homemade potato chips was less spectacular but was saved by a great cole slaw. Yes, cole slaw and yes, it was better than KFC.\n\nThe menu says \"10 dollars additional\" for the foie gras appetizer. I found out why. It's not an appetizer, it's a foie gras steak. It looks like a filet mignon, it's so big.\n\nEnter the best lamb chop I've ever had along with quail and squab stuffed with mushrooms. Let me say that by now we're delirious with our own gluttony.\n\nFinally, the dessert that wouldn't win a beauty contest but has an amazing personality. By \"personality\", I mean the best combination of tropical flavors I've had - mango and coconut tapioca with a basil syrup. I don't care how tall your pastry chef can make it - this dessert tastes better than any sculpture.\n\nThe clientele is a bit on the stuffy side, but the service is friendly, sommelier is great and the chef greets every table!\n\n[This is my second choice for super-duper-fancy French food.

We had the the chef's amuse offerings, our appetizers and our dinner served to us in a 45 minute time frame. This after we asked our server while we were on the appetizer to slow things down. A good French meal should give one time to digest and enjoy each serving. \n\nThe food was good, not great, not nearly as good as many other French meals we've enjoyed. After we told our server to take the entrees away because we could not eat them just minutes after finishing our appetizers, we suggested that she just bring the desserts we ordered in 20 minutes or so. Instead, she left us sitting there for a half hour with no further interaction. We finally asked for the manager. He listened impatiently to our story, told us it was not the server's fault but our own for writing in the reservation box that we had to leave in two hours. He then charged us $92 for two glasses of wine and the two appetizers as we left before the desserts ever made it out. It was a horrible experience that did not need to happen.

The service is not bad although could be a little warmer... well they are french, guess i should not ask too much.  \nAgain, the food is very very good.

This restaurant probably has zero table turnover and is probably what a real french restaurant would be like (with 3 - 4 hr dinners).  The high price comes with slow/zero turnover, but with it also comes very high quality food and service.  \n\nI honestly cannot remember everything I had, but we ordered the 3-course prix fixe menu, although they had several amuse-bouches interspersed within the meal.  However, I do remember the taste was excellent and the presentation was creative.  This is the first time I've been to a really really fancy restaurant and I felt it was a good experience and worth the price. \n\nOne minor thing about our dinner was the dessert.  It was great, but a little too sweet for our tastes; I think our course selection would have gone to better use with a savory dish instead of dessert.  The chef also provided us a plate of several petit fours after the meal, so the dessert was redundant.  Oh well, next time!\n\nWaiter service was excellent, as expected.

Recently, however, we went in celebration of a friend's birthday and had a less-than-great experience.  The food was excellent, as always.  But on that particular night, the service was a bit of a mess.  The pacing of the courses was off, the wine service was poor, and, overall, we felt neglected throughout the night.  So you might be wondering why this is a five star review.  Well I'll tell you.  I wrote La Folie an extensive email about the not-so-great night and shared with them my disappointment and my impressions.  La Folie then went to the end of the earth to right the ship.  Roland Passot called me personally and offered an extensive apology (he is positively delightful, by the way) and invited us back in to make it up to us.  He relayed that he had had several discussions with his staff to ensure that all of the service issues were addressed in an effort to ensure that the service remains at its typically stellar quality.   Even more recently, we took La Folie up on its invitation and went back and I'm back to being a huge, and loyal fan.  The food and the service was wonderful.  This is a place that really strives for perfection.  And, on the off chance they miss that mark, they're going to try like hell to make it up.", "author": "Sara T."}

Depending on what you order, you could have the best dining experience ever, or find it quite bland and boring.  Recently I went on a Sunday evening (they are not typically open on Sundays, but only during holiday season), and the place was empty.  We had a group of 7 and were seated in the back room which was extremely cold and the background music was quite loud.  I'd say the service is quite good and not obtrusive, but not exceptional like I've experienced elsewhere.\n\nAs for the food, let me start with the foie gras soup.  Amazingly creamy, and the scallop ravioli with truffles was exquisite!  I only with the soup was hotter... it was served very luke warm.  But I suppose they don't want you to burn your tongue and not enjoy the full flavor of the dish.  I'm a huge foie gras fan, so the foie gras lollipops (quail drumsticks stuffed with foie gras) did not disappoint!  However, the seared foie gras dish was drenched with balsamic sauce which did not match at all, and was a disappointment.  As a special, they had dungeness crab ceviche served in martini glass.  They were very generous with the crab meat and it was extremely fresh, but nothing special.  I'd rather just buy a whole crab and cook it myself to enjoy the entire thing for less money.  I had lobster for my main course and it one of the most bland, boring dishes ever.  The lobster was a little overcooked, and the broth that it was sitting in had no flavor at all.  \n\nSo it really just depends on what you order here, and honestly I will not be going back.  I expected so much more from La Folie with so many high ratings and good reviews.  The quality is inconsistent and I don't want to have to feel like I'm gambling with what I order.

I could give it 4 stars because surpasses what most restaurants are capable of.\nThe service was impeccable, but the room is rather drab and conservative.  It fades to the background with beige curtains everywhere.  \nThe menu seems a little disjointed, half traditional, half adventurous.  Usually I like that, but the variety (coupled with my A.D.D.) led me astray.  I ended up with disparate parts and the transitions from course to course were jarring.\nSome of the dishes, and especially the amuse bouche(s?), were stellar, really interesting and well crafted.  Others were weighed down, maybe too heavy handed for a prix fixe menu? \nAmuse: The 'poached' egg with cream and chives and the sardine with cous cous were both well executed and balanced.\n1st course: The trio of roe, infused with 3 different flavors was my favorite dish.  The urchin panna cotta with seaweed salad and trout roe was particularly memorable.   The other parts, roe over crab, and roe with kona kamachi tartare and egg white were a little off kilter for my palate, but still the risk makes it a success.\n2nd: Maybe I am not sophisticated enough for the terrine, but that was so rich and oily and fatty.  Maybe its just the quantity.  Too much, it could be 1/3 or 1/4 the size and satiate my need for sweetbreads.\n3rd: My next favorite, the loch duart salmon was cooked perfectly.  The sear was just right, great texture.  The sweet onion sauce, and the escarole were fantastic additions: they enriched the fish and provided contrast. \n4th: Rabbit was tasty, but poor presentation, and again way too much food!!  The leg was so juicy, but the tenderloin was barely worth eating once you are that full.\nMy girlfriend did 3 courses, a soup of the day, the day boat scallops, and the lobster.

Only reason we wouldn't give La Folie five stars is that this is not a relaxing dining experience - we spent a wonderful two and half hours there but they work so hard to make sure you enjoy the experience that you don't really ever relax.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-31", "description": "I'm not sure how michelin gives out their stars, but I feel this place deserves more than the 1 that they were given. It saddens me that I can't give this place 5 stars, but I will now admit that this is my fault, considering that I couldn't fully appreciate the last 2 courses because I was full by the time they arrived.\n\nAt 5 courses for $95, I thought their prices were a bargain, but that bargain was more than made up for by the time I paid the bill. So for my 5 courses, I had the duck and oxtail consomme, pig feet, lobster, and quail and squab topped with shredded truffles just arrived from southern France (at an add on of $35) and the \"sunset\" for dessert, a chocolate fondant. The bro, whose bday we were celebrating, had the foie gras pate, tempura fried duck egg, artic char, venison, and some other thing I can't remember for dessert. \nWe started off our meal with the oesetra caviar topped on a potato blini with creme fraiche. If this was the only thing served for our meal, I would have ordered it over and over and over again, even at $115 an ounce. Next were 2 amouse bouche compliments of the chef, one which was some egg thing that was utterly orgasmic, and the other, a lobster thing that was forgetful. While we were eating, we were drinking  A LOT of wine, as well as champagne, so I forget the details of our food. \n\nNow for the main stuff. The consomme was nothing spectacular, but flavorful, yet the pate the bro ordered was the perfect add on to it. The pigs feet didn't look or taste like pigs feet, as it's texture was moist and the flavor robust with lobster terrine, but I could have done without the bed of lentils that were a little salty for my tastes. The lobster tail was amazing, and fresh tasting, even though I think that had to have been left over from an earlier shipment (the amuse bouche lobster leads me to believe this). The bro said the artic char was nothing special. By this time I was FULL and a little inebriated, so there was a battle to finish the quail and squab. The quail and squab won, but I didn't let the truffles go to waste, as I picked off every single last bit that I could see. I tried a small piece of venison from the bro, and it was amazing. The tenderness of it, as well as the flavor that was enhance by the bordeaux gave me an extra wind in eating. Dessert was basically almost impossible to eat. I had just a few bites of the fondant, and it just didn't seem worth it anymore considering I had already loosened my belt by twice. They also included a special assortment of macaroons, madelines, and a couple other things with a dark chocolate block that had \"happy birthday\" written on it. \n\nThat last touch of effort demonstrated just how excellent the service here is. From the time we were seated, up until when our waiter hailed a cab for us, the service was hands down the BEST I have ever experienced, michelin starred restaurant or not. I really felt like royalty here the way I was served. And even the couple that were dressed like slobs seated near my table (seriously jeans and a t-shirt at this kind of establishment don't deserve good service in my book) were given amazing service comparable to mine. The staff takes a lot of time and effort into making the entire dinner memorable. But with great food and great service comes a price: dinner for 2, wine, champagne, \"SF healthy tax\" (complete and utter b.s. for non san franciscans) and tip = $680. I'm not a big fan of going to SF, but  would make an effort to come here again. Next time I'll be sure to only order 3 courses with caviar, and much, much less wine.", "author": "Josh R."}

Our server on the other hand was a disaster. First ,she described a special appetizer that sounded great. The 4 of us each ordered one. It WAS great. Unfortunately, it was not until we received the bill that we realized that the appetizers were $75 each. The second event was even worse. The restaurant had a great chicken and truffle dish. They gave you the option of extra truffles for $25 more. I ordered the extra truffle dish and my friend ordered the regular dish. The server delivered the courses at separate times and delivered my chicken dish before (way before) my friend's. He insisted that I start and so I had  about 2-3 bites before his was delivered. His came and we discovered that he actually was served the extra-truffle dish. When we alerted our server, her reaction was, \"well, just switch plates\". I thought she was kidding. She wasn't. She refused to take the orders back or bring a side of truffles. \nAnyway, I heard she was fired not too long ago so I think I will try it again. They also remodeled and got rid of the clown puppets.

And so was the butter! I wish, however, that the log of bread had been more of a roll. It seemed to be all crust, no bread. The olive roll was delightful and I wish they had passed those out initially. \n\nAmuse bouche(s): \n*The apple-fennel shot - interesting in a good way. Sweet and savory at once. \n*The egg yolk in leek-mushroom broth and brioche - great. Very tasty. *The salmon-mascarpone lollipops - adorable and yummy. Subtle.\n\nFirst course: \n*The corn soup with sweetbreads, truffles, and lobster - very good. I like corn and the soup was nice after a long day outside with no sweater. I love sweetbreads and truffles and the lobster was extremely tender. It seems everyone was ordering this to start. \nSecond course: \n*Pig feet, sweetbreads, and lobster terrine - Ok...the dish was delicious, don't get me wrong...but the portion should have been about a fourth of the size. ESPECIALLY because it was so heavy. I felt incredibly guilty after eating it and my tasting menu nights are the only time I allow myself not to feel guilty about eating pure fat. If this doesn't concern you, this dish is really superb. You could hardly taste the lobster, but the taste of pig feet and sweetbreads were to die for. \n*Frog legs - definitely much lighter. They were cute, but it wasn't anything that wow-ed me. \n\nThird course: \n*Black Cod - Bland. I was disappointed. The beans were crunchy. They definitely were a bit undercooked. I ended up stealing more of my friend's dish.\n*Halibut - Great! The eggplant along with the tasty halibut made it that much better. I also loved the lobster stuffed squashblossom. She thought it was too heavy.\n\nFourth course:\n*Roti of Quail and Squab - This was also very tasty. But the portion was so BIG. The potato strings were very good...Everything was really good. I recommend this dish.\n*Trio of Rabbit: Also very tasty. My friend couldn't finish it. There was no meat on the ribs. The presentation was very cute.\n\nPalate Cleanser:\n*Cardamom pudding with pluot - Fantastic! Even though my stomach was doing somersaults from over-stuffing myself, I wish this item was actually on the dessert menu. I just wanted to take a gallon of it home.\n\nFifth Course: \n*Edam souffle - Very good. Subtle and nice. I even liked the bacon bits, which I wasn't expecting.\n*Fig Tart with Goat cheese ice cream - This was interesting...more so in a  bad way. The figs were bitter and goat cheese icecream...well... I just don't know.\n\nAfter this fifth course -- actually after the fourth course -- I wanted out. I was so stuffed I was in pain. Then, guess what?\n\nPetit Fours:\n*Whatever the hell that chocolate bit was...was well-worth another bite even though I felt like I could never eat again. It was absolutely wonderful. \n\nThis would get five stars if I didn't feel like I was going to give birth/have a heart attack. Even a day later, I haven't had anything but water because I'm not hungry! I ate five meals! What a feat!\n\nMy friend and I are going on a several day detox after our non-deliberate fast.

Would it possibly be worthy of my 300th review (I've been waiting for weeks to figure out what could possibly deserve this milestone)? Well, La Folie completely lived up to expectations. Simply put, it was amazing. I don't think I've ever had a dish more delicious than the butter poached lobster over butternut squash ravioli with a celery root salad. It was phenomenal. The soup is served tableside, and the pumpkin soup was perfect- and I consider myself an expert of sorts regarding pumpkin soup. The beef tenderloin with marrow crust was perfectly medium rare and so full of flavor. The amuse bouche was amazing, and the cheese souffle dessert reminded me of something I saw on Top Chef and wished I could try. It was far better than Fleur de Lys. And I loved Fleur de Lys. There is much more I could say, but it would only be more superlatives, so I'll end by saying, its worth the splurge- every penny. And that I really want the chandelier in the bathroom to be in my apartment.", "author": "Noelle Q."}

We did the full-blown 5 course menu, champagne, 2 half bottles, caviar, truffles-- the works...and believe me it was the most I have EVER spent on a meal...so expensive I am not even going to tell you because I am NOT loaded! Eating here was like a really good one-night stand (which honestly I never did-- but I am imagining that it would feel somewhat ecstatic) and then the next night going, wow that was amazing- what happened? How much did I spend? Holy &%$$&&$! A meal of a lifetime. The pictures truly are what you get: all of the plates were amazing: the lobster claw over lemon gelee, foi groi and quail pops, lamb shank, the caviar, butter poached lobster, delicate halibut cheeks...superb.

Amazing food, excellent service, and an adorable french chef that comes out and greets you tableside to see how you're enjoying the food.  If I could change anything, I'd say make the portions smaller.  That's right, smaller.  The food was so good that I wanted to eat every bite on my plate, knowing I still had more dishes coming my way.  What can I say, I have no self control when it comes to food.  I only ordered the 3 course meal, but with the additional complimentary amuse bouches, sampling other plates on the table, and an additional dessert on the house, I was overly stuffed.  Major hits were the ramp soup, lobster risotto, and the duck course.  The cheese sorbet was nice and refreshing.  I left full, happy, and satisfied, albeit a bit too full.  I'll be back with a less fitted dress.  Oh, almost forgot to mention, we left forgetting about the huge portion of rabbit that the boyfriend hadn't finished which they offered to box up.

Living only a few blocks from this little joint with the wooden blinds blocking public view of it's high class interior, I was pretty excited to finally be dining here.  It was a special occasion, so we splurged.  An aperatif (kir), foie gras soup, vegetarian butternut squash soup - I loved the presentation - 2 crab appetizers (one was complimentary), barramundi (like bluenose sea bass) with pt. reyes clam chowder, quail and squab (squab is a gamebird - the meat is juicy, red and tender like nothing I've ever had and wouldn't have ordered had our server not recommended it) and a cheese plate to top it off (yum!).  The food is amazingly good.  Service was delightful, making me feel spoiled: a complimentary foie gras dish in between the appetizers and main course, extra large glasses for our second serving of wine, and a plate of beautiful chocolate truffles at the end of our meal.  I loved every minute of our 3 hour pampering dining experience.  I think it was worth every cent, but then I didn't have to pay the bill. :)  It was quite possibly the most perfect dining experience i've had in San Francisco.", "author": "Haru K."}

Many of the dishes are not new, as they are crowd favorites, but even so there are always some new seasonal dishes.\n\nFirst off, parking maybe difficult, as it is on Polk, in the Russian Hill area; they offer valet for $15.\n\nThe interior, you can see from the photos posted at the top of the page.\n\nThe place is not stuffy at all. The age of diners here ranged from mid-20's to the silverhairs. When the room filled up during the primetime dining hours, the noise level stayed at a energetic hum, but you never really need to raise your voice to be heard by your dining companion(s). Dress code wise, you'll see a wide range. Tonight I saw a couple jeans and sweaters. I saw an older woman trying to look fashionable in ugly jeans and ratty top. Most of the diners are dressed business casual and up.\n\nDishes I had (or sampled from others): the seared foie gras. You get a big portion here. Most places give you a thin piece that is roughly the size of a half dollar. That is crap. You can't cook it properly that way and taste the foie the way it's supposed to end up. No worries here. You get a nice thick, big slice in a fig and balsamic vinegar sauce. \nThe Pigs feet and lobster terrine is also very good. Don't let the idea of \"pigs feet\" scare you, it comes in a pate type consistency and all the meats, flavors, and textures work.\nSturgeon with oxtail is a dish that is good, but the oxtail kind of sits out on its own on a little patty and doesn't really work directly with the sturgeon in my opinion. Trying both of them together yields an interesting texture and taste contrast, but didn't work completely for me.\nRoti of stuffed quail and squab. Another large portioned dish. The skin is very crispy and the meat is a moist medium-rare. If the red poultry meat scares you, then try another dish.  There is a nice accent on the plate with a fried quail egg contained on a little patty/crispy skin arrangement. \nThe cheese plate is pretty good. Gary Danko gives you larger portions of cheese (and you can pick what you want), but La Folie's wasn't bad. \n\nService overall is professional and helpful. It's not as polished as Gary Danko or The Dining Room, but it's good enough. There were no real mishaps, except maybe neglecting to ask if we wanted more bread or if we wanted to order more wine when we finished our half bottle.\n\nThis place definitely deserves all the accolades it receives.", "author": "Cary W."}

Had the 5-course and had major issues with almost every dish but could only muster up the courage to complain about one. I had the sweet corn soup to start, which was pretty good but also made me realize I'm not a big sweetbread fan. So that's my bad. My appetizer was warm pig feet, which did in fact taste like dirty feet rolled around in mud because the aftertaste was musky and strange. The meat was also tough in some parts and I found this cold glob of fat that had no business being there. Portion was ginormous with way too much salad - it looked like a leafy toupee sitting on top of rolled meat. And it was so salty that my tongue burned. So this dish I did complain about and had to order tea to cleanse my palate - which they charged me for (what nerve!). Had the butter poached lobster with a strange gloppy asian-tasting sauce like someone spilled corn starch all over it. The english pea ravioli was definitely not al dente - it was way overcooked and slimy from the gloppy sauce on top. The lobster itself was underseasoned (perhaps because of my previous salty complaint?). Finally, there was the trio of rabbit. There was a loin wrapped around carrots and spinach. The vegetables tasted wet and the meat also had a strange aftertaste, almost gamey. The \"rack\" was microscopic so I can't comment on that since it was too small to really taste the meat. The braised leg was tough with the outer layer almost like a shell wrapped around underseasoned mushrooms.  My dessert was exceptional: chocolate bread pudding with basil olive oil ice cream and a champagne sabayon. Oh, thank god this was good. I felt like crying at the table. And they also provided a complimentary peach melba baked alaska, which was also incredible but I had no room left to finish it after the huge warm pig feet appetizer. Overall, I was dissatisfied with the food.  The soup and desserts were great but that was it. Service was pretty good but our server didn't consistently refill the teapot with hot water, was awol for periods of time, and was reading notes off a notepad for one of the amuse bouches.

The dinner is very fairly priced and will impress any date. The sommelier is good enough to encourage your wine drinking, which can make your bill grow very fast.

I immediately received a call from the owner and chef.  He was horrified to hear of our experience and offered to rectify the situation by having us back for a complimentary meal.  We will return and give the restaurant a second chance.  I was touched at how personally disturbed Chef Passot sounded and I look forward to trying to restaurant again.  I also hope that the waiter is given a second chance and reforms his ways.  I have no desire to interfere with someone making a living, no matter how off or rude he was on a particular night.  I hate the thought of someone possibly losing their job over what was just a poor dining experience for me.  That said, he needs to improve how he treats guests!\nI will update after our next night at La Folie.  \n\nI fully expected this to be a 5 star experience.  A friend who is general manager of a top-level winery in St. Helena recommended La Folie as his favorite restaurant in the city, and I've heard the same from others.  My boyfriend and I were ready to be impressed.  Unfortunately, bad service and unremarkable food turned the evening into a $400 learning experience.  \n\nThe table we were sat at - right in the middle of the room - was in the perfect spot for a cold blast of air every time the front door was opened (and often kept open for a minute at a time). This could have been forgiven - after all, someone has to get the bad table.\n\nComing down from a very long week of work, my boyfriend, a man who has lived all over the world and has been to countless fine dining establishments, opened the menu and started to ask for a glass of white wine by saying something along the lines of \"Do you have something white by the glass...[pausing while he decided what he was looking for]\".  The waiter cut him off and said \"Of course we have white wine by the glass,\" and condescendingly showed him the wine list.  Yes, we did understand that you sell glasses of wine.  Please don't be so quick to underestimate your guests (boyfriend was in business suit - there was no reason for this snap judgment).\n\nRunner brought boyfriend a fois gras appetizer that we did not order.  runner graciously returned it to the kitche after offering that we could keep it \"for free.\"  We did not order it and did not opt to keep it at no charge.  Boyfriend went to use restroom and was cornered by waiter who kept insisting that boyfriend ordered f.g.  Very annoying.\n\nWe made a point of ordering truffles added to my final course.  It was a $45 surcharge, which we agreed to twice.  Final course came out with no truffles.  Waiter offered to have it remade - but of course I would then be stuck eating without boyfriend, whose (nearly raw - not medium rare) boef was sitting in front of him at that point.  when you decide to go all out and spend a few hundred dollars on dinner, you do not expect these mistakes to happen.\n\nwe opted to split a sorbet dessert and a cheese plate.  i asked for some suggestions for which cheeses to select, but our waiter - apparently miffed that we did not take his suggestion on another course - made a comment about how we didn't listen to him so he was no longer going to suggest anything.  excuse me??  i worked as a server for about 6 years at casual restaurants, and i was way more polite to my guests than this guy at a fine dining restaurant was.  after i cajoled him to offer some suggestions, we ordered the cheeses and also a sorbet dessert.  we made it clear we were splitting both, yet waiter brought them both out at the same time.  of course we would have preferred first the cheese and then the dessert - as is proper and as it should be in a (i'm repeating myself here...) restaurant that runs $400 for 2 for dinner.  As a result, we quickly gobbled some cheese and then turned to our then melted sorbet.  \n\ni don't recommend la folie - and i was ready to love it.  should have saved half our money and eaten at kokkari.  there is just no excuse for this level of service at a restaurant that has the nerve to complain about getting just one Michelin star.", "author": "Judy S."}

My friend and I had reservations at 9:30pm on a Saturday night.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by the host and seated almost immediately.  The room was smaller than I had expected but quite typical for this part of San Francisco.  The warm colors and decor were very welcoming considering the cold fall weather we just stepped in from.  My only complaint thus far were the two large parties on either side of our table, each of about 12 people and creating quite a stir of commotion and noise.  Upon seating, we were offered the wine list and were quite unsure whether to go with a bottle of white or red or have them decide with wine pairings for each course.  After much thought and advice from their wine expert, we decided on a bottle of French Pinot Noir (excellent by the way).  The dinner courses each had an array of choices to choose from, all of which sounded very appetizing!  My friend had alerted me that their portions were relatively big yet we still decided on the 5 course route.  While our first course was being prepared, one of the servers brought out a treat from the chef; it was two raw mini scallops with lemon to help open our palates for dinner... Mighty tasty and boy did it do the job; literally melted in my mouth!  The chef's second amuse bouche was a poached egg yolk served with chives and a crouton; also very good!  My first course was the pumpkin soup with cinnamon marshmallow.  It was a very interesting presentation; server brought out a covered bowl with chestnuts surrounding the marshmallow and asked if I was ready, he then proceeded to pour the hot soup overtop for me to devour.  This was the most amazingly comforting soup I've had in my entire life.  The seasoning with spices was perfect!  Second course was the sea scallop with pumpkin cake and wild mushrooms. It was also very good but nothing compared to the diver scallops I've had at Asia de Cuba.  The third course was the salmon with gnocchi cooked just to my liking, medium and tender.  My friend ordered the black cod as his third course but for some reason, unbenounced to us, it never came out.  Instead, a small white plate was placed in front of him for me to share my course.  I found that quite odd and very out of the ordinary for a place like this but nonetheless, shared my salmon like we both did for all of our courses.  The final, savory course I had was the carnivore plate.  I called it that because it had 3 types of meats (appropriately called \"Le Boeuf,\" French for \"The Beef\"), a beef tenderloin, a short rib and a mini burger stuffed with foie gras.  This was, by far, the best meat I've had in a long time!  The tenderloin was absolutely cooked to perfection.  The sauce on the plate was a great accompaniment to it.  The short rib was to die for!  It literally was so tender that it felt like it was already pre-chewed for me (in a good way, that is!).  My only wish was that I got a bigger portion of it.  The burger was exactly what I expected of a burger from a fancy French restaurant; a petite-sized sandwich stuffed with foie gras, but of course!  Excellent to say the least!  One thing that amazed me was how orchestrated the staff were.  I noticed how they literally would motion to eachother to pull out the chairs for their patrons or to fold napkins before they returned to their tables.  Another nice attention to detail was how our server, Diane, noticed me admiring all the desserts that were being served to the other tables all throughout our dinner.  She mentioned that our dessert course was next and that I looked like I had been ready for it all night; being that I'm a huge fan of sweets, she hit the nail on the head!  She brought out a palate cleanser of cardamon yogurt topped with a hibiscus flower puree, it was delish and definitely woke up my sweet tooth!  As a necessity for dessert, I motioned to the wine expert and asked him if he recommended any dessert wines to pair with.  We decided on a Muscat and were served one glass on the house to compensate for the unsually loud noise from the big parties of the night.  My final course was the banana tart with chocolate and ice cream.  It was to die for as well and a  great way to end a great meal!  Since my friend and I shared eachother's food, we were able to taste alot of what the restaurant had to offer.  He had the dungeness crab salad with caviar, lobster risotto with shaved black truffles from the Himilayas (one of the highlights of the night, I must say!), the lamb loin with potatoes and, lastly, the souffle with bacon bits and ice cream for dessert. As a final offering, Diane brought out a plate of petite fours for both of us to enjoy.  She told us to either take little bites of each or to consume all of it.  No question of what we did; the latter seemed more appealing!", "author": "D. E."}

My friend ordered the foie gras, lamb chops and chocolate fondant. they served us some amuse buch - slightly poached egg, which was really delicious. the escargots were served inside a bone with bone marrow which was very interesting and they were very good. the foie gras was a nice big piece that was seared and it melted in my mouth. I thought the duck was a little tough and bland for my taste so i would not order it again. the lamb was juicy and tender. the chocolat fondant was good but really heavy and thick. my cheese soufle was interesting and good. the meal ended up being $240 with the addition of 2 glasses of wine.....the only bad part about la folie is that it had ONE unisex restroom there was a line forming from the bathroom past the kitchen, it was a bit crowded with the waiters walking in and out from the kitchen, they gave us the option to go out and into their lounge next door but i didnt feel like leaving to go next door to go to the restroom..other than that, it was a nice experience and the food was good and it was pricey so I would probably only go here on special occasions", "author": "Linda L."}

What we enjoyed the most were the cauliflower soup, scallop dish, and the lobster.   The foie mousse from the kitchen was heavenly.  The dishes were creative and flavors complex, and presentation beautiful.  The service was nice and the chef took the time, to come out and visit with everyone.", "author": "ChaCha C."}

Service is attentive and the brother of the owner has a good knowledge of the wine list that he manages. That much being said, I am not going to this restaurant any longer after Mr. Passot snubbed me two years ago by abruptly walking out of our discussion in mid sentence. I had gone to this place maybe one dozen times in the last 5-6 years but no longer. This restaurant is overrated by one and all.", "author": "Jean-Louis F."}

The prices reflect the quality, which is also why this restaurant is Michelin rated.  La Folie is a special place that should not be saved just for special occasions, but instead is a place to enjoy your meal and your evening.  Simply put... La Folie is Tre Magnific!", "author": "Trina W."}

I assumed she planned to seat us at one that hadn't opened up yet. When we came back ten minutes later, one of the two tables that was initially open, in a nice position by the window, had been occupied, leaving only the other, positioned directly to catch every wind blast from the open door, and a new one that had opened up by the wall. With sinking spirits, I saw that the hostess was leading us to the windy table, the most uncomfortable position in the house. I asked if we could sit at the one by the wall so that we might be out of the wind, but she said they needed that one for later. My discomfiture must have been evident, because eventually the hostess came back and offered to reseat us when something opened up, which was a nice gesture, but she never actually followed through with it. My reception of the food, therefore, may have been colored by the fact that I did not feel especially welcome from the outset. It was by no means a bad meal, but by the high standards of the Bay Area, it did not make a strong impression. The cold foie gras torchon was of very good quality, though not shockingly smooth and rich like the one I was served recently at Cyrus. The items it was paired with moreover, seemed random and not especially complimentary. I was more impressed with the seared foie gras on grilled peach that my partner tried. The \"passat roe\" trio was strong, the frog legs a bit overwhelmed by their preparation (deep-fried) but well-complimented by the sauces, and the rabbit trio a bit bland but acceptable. The edam souffle and fromage blanc sorbet that I had for dessert were a harmonious pair. I'm a bit baffled by the fact that La Folie's website, including the online menu, does not seem to have been updated since January 2008. Apart from the hostess, whose manner felt somewhat brittle and cold, the rest of the staff was very gracious, including the chef who made the rounds later in the evening. For the food alone I would give it four stars, good but not great, but the atmosphere knocks it down to three: the room was excessively loud, and the wind was cold.", "author": "Jessica P."}

We sat in a table in the back kitty korner to each other which allowed us to be sort of off to ourselves so we could talk in private but still observe what was going on.  My date and I each got  3 courses and shared everything.  He had the foie gras which was a huge portion and very good although the huckleberry sauce could have had more flavor.   He then got the duck which was good but a bit salty and the cheese plate for dessert which was good but the cheeses were not too innovative or imaginative.  I had the escargot to start which was very good and flavorful but not a very big portion and since I was sharing only got 2 small escargot.  I then had the lamb that was tender and delicious (better than the duck).  For desert had the oozing warm chocolate cake which was delicous and a nice finish to a very good meal.  The service was good and each dish was presented to the table with an explanation of exactly what it was. We were able to take our time and have a nice lesuirely meal.   A romantic place with good food that lives up to it's reputation as a fine dining establishment", "author": "Melanie -."}
