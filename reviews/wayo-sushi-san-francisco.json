We saw that Wayo was right down the street from our hotel, and decided to walk down. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by how warm and inviting the space was, especially with it being right on noisy/busy Van Ness.  The staff were super polite, and you could tell right off the bat that the Itamae was old-school - super quiet, and always working on his craft. I knew I was about to get some quality stuff. \n\nI ordered Seaweed Salad for an appetizer (my husband hates it, so I got it all to myself), then we ordered Unagi Maki, Spicy Tuna, and Salmon roll (yes, my Norwegian husband got salmon because he was scared of everything else)  \n\nSuffice it to say, the food was delicious, the waiter was polite & attentive, and authentic sushi bar was a great aesthetic touch.

Honestly a decent little sushi joint, totally worth skipping long lines for. I give it 3.5 stars.\n\nI would like to start off by saying the sashimi is top notch, especially the albacore (we also got salmon). The pieces were perfectly cut, the taste was delectable. Some of the best sashimi I've had, I highly recommend it here. Everything else we ordered was pretty good... alright. We had a few rolls, with the dynamite roll probably being my favorite. Honestly it was a little surprising to me the contrast between the taste of the sashimi versus the rolls. I wonder if maybe the recipe for the rice needs altering (since they say the rice makes the roll!). Overall though, the food was decent. I've had better rolls elsewhere but again, with the wait times being insane at most other places in the area, the quality of these rolls suffices. \n\nThe place itself is quite small. There are just a handful of tables and seating around the sushi bar. I would not come here with a large group, unfortunately. But with a small group of friends this place is perfect. We got a fantastic spot in the corner by the window. It was nice to look outside and people watch while hanging with friends.\n\nOverall, Wayo is a pretty good sushi spot. I appreciated the lack of wait time and amazing sashimi. I would like to go back and try the rolls again to see if anything changes (I'll update you all when I do!).", "author": "Camille G."}

No frills, dim lighting, and just the bar table separating me and the chef. \n\nI started off with a round of sake to get my tastebuds rolling. \n\nHere's my order:\n\nEdamame - Pretty standard and not much to actually write home about, but I enjoy ordering these as an appetizer to suffice the munchies. Boiled and perfectly salted. \n\nMango Crab Salad - I didn't know what to expect when ordering this, whether I would get real crab or imitation, but it just so happened that this came out with the real deal, albeit frozen. The crab texture wasn't too bad and I was surprised that it wasn't even stringy; quite pleasant. The mango was wonderfully sweet and at the perfect point of ripeness. All this was served over a bed of lettuce. Really light and flavorful. \n\nHiyayakko - Contrasting Agedashi Tofu, Hiyayakko is served cold and slightly swimming in a light soy dressing. Topped with sliced scallions, bonito, and a hint of ginger, this refreshing dish can get quite addicting. \n\nSalmon Salad - This dish looks unassuming and plain, but I'd say that this was probably one of my favorites as a starter. Fresh salmon slices with lettuce and simply dressed with a ponzu vinaigrette; this was definitely one that yielded brightness and crisp texture. Great starter. \n\nAmaebi - I'm super picky about my raw shrimp preparations. My 2 criterias are that it better be plump and it better exude the natural sweetness. Here, I can tell it's completely fresh. The only slight let down is that I wasn't given the shrimp heads alongside, but I figure that's only from restaurant to restaurant. \n\nTobiko - Delightfully sweet and salty. These were done with great deft. Usually at other restaurants, it only highlights the saltiness. \n\nUnagi - It's pretty hard to screw unagi up. This dish was equally great and on par with other surrounding Japanese restaurants. Yum!\n\nHotate - Silky and fresh, these scallops were clean and slightly sweet. Mmm so good. \n\nSake - Fresh and perfectly cut. Very enjoyable. \n\nEbi - Tasty cooked shrimp served cold. Good complimenting nigiri to the table. \n\nMaguro - Fresh tasting and with great texture. I love when tuna is slightly firm, yet still provides a soft clean bite. \n\nI've had super duper high quality omakases before and there's really no comparison, but with that said, considering how service was incredibly attentive and the given freshness aligned to pricing, this place is awesome. Although there were only 2 people handling the entire restaurant and with maybe around 8-10 patrons, the food came out quick and water glasses were promptly filled each time. \n\nGreat neighborhood restaurant. Kudos to this wonderful mom and pop shop!\n\nOh and keep in mind that parking can be limited. Located on busy Van Ness along with crazy construction.", "author": "Ann S."}

Also the restaurant is run by one waitress and one chef and so the wait can be long... however, the food is great! Wayo only offers a small sushi selection but the sushi is excellently prepared. The sushi rice is perfect in flavor and texture. Also, the fish is some of the freshest and most delicious fish I have had at a non super high end restaurant. The best fishes in my opinion are the uni and hamachi. Both are so ridiculously good! The  chef's choice is also fairly affordable for the amount of food (I believe miso soup, salad, a tuna roll, and 7 pieces of nigiri.) I usually get that and an order or uni. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend Wayo if you are in the area. The place is not super fancy but it's good and low key.

Fortunately I discovered Wayo Sushi just down the block from the Regency and decided to stop in here for a quick bite.\n\nGood job, Stefanie. Solid choice. It's a tiny place that's open for lunch from noon until 1:30 PM and it's not busy at all. There's one sushi chef and one woman handling all the customer interactions. There's bar seating that wraps around most of the restaurant, as well as tables below for bigger groups. I sat at the bar and ordered the dynamite roll. \n\nThe sushi made here is so simple and tasty. Whenever I have a dynamite roll, it's baked in some day and drenched with sauce. The sushi chef here emphasizes the freshness of ingredients inside the roll and allows customers to add flavor with the usual wasabi and soy sauce. Refreshing, for lack of a better adjective. As I finished up my first roll, I ordered the spicy salmon skin roll. The salmon was baked in foil and spread across the roll. Amazing!\n\nIn total, I spent around $19 inclusive for my lunch. It was such a peaceful and lovely experience. The two individuals that work here are so respectful and customer service oriented.

Blink and you might miss their tiny place on Van Ness. What they lack in size, however, they make up for in quality and heart. Wayo is run by what I assume to be a couple - the husband makes each and every piece by hand himself, while the wife waits on customers. Expect a wait because of this, but they'll let you know as soon as you walk in how long you can expect to wait for your food. It's typically 30-45 minutes, but I never had a problem relaxing and waiting in this quaint little spot with some hot sake. \nThey don't have the largest variety of rolls - if you're in the market for a wide range of specialty rolls, then this probably isn't your spot. However, they do have all the classics and a specials board (it never changes) that features a variety of rolls with mango that are all delicious. The fish is high quality, and the craft that goes into their food makes me really appreciate this spot. Though their menu lacks a little diversity, the food and atmosphere is far from generic. \nI'd recommend trying it at least once!", "author": "Traci A."}

I've eaten my fair share of sushi over the years, from the cheap $2.25/plate to fish that's flown in from Japan daily. Wayo Sushi's fish is up there on my list. The chef takes great care in preparing each piece. For example, I and my friends ordered eel nigiri (for me) and a roll with eel in it (for my friend); the chef put each individual piece in the oven one by one.\n\nBefore coming here, I read the Yelp reviews, and yes, it IS a small establishment, consisting of one chef and one waitress. Be prepared to be patient and wait for your food. We arrived ~12:15-12:30PM. With four of us ordering something to-go, and only 1 person ahead of us, the next party that stepped into the restaurant was told that it'd be a 45 minute wait.\n\nI ordered the lunch combo (~$18), consisting of miso soup, salad, and 10 pieces (6 pieces of California roll, 1 eel nigiri, 1 salmon nigiri, 1 yellowtail nigiri, and 1 tuna nigiri). Small curls of green onion were plentiful in the soup, which I liked. The California roll uses real crab meat instead of the fake 'krab' kind, so I was pleasantly surprised. The eel was so fatty, buttery, soft, and delicious! The salmon looked so fresh, and the slice was hefty. My friend commented that it's difficult to make the rice just right, and so she was impressed with the chef's skills.\n\nYes, the prices are a little pricey, but then again, the restaurant is on Van Ness, so when you factor in the rent and the fish and level of detail that the chef puts into his food, I think it's kinda reasonable (just not an everyday meal for me).", "author": "Dana L."}

Hey, it's got some good reviews and you're a trusted friend source. Why not?! Let's give it a go!\n\nThey open at 6pm for dinner, so we ended up walking around the area until they opened. Once inside, there were a few tables and a bar that surrounded the sushi chef. Most of the patrons that ended up walking in decided to sit at the bar. We chose to sit at the tables to give ourselves more room.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that we ordered 4 rolls or so and it filled us right up for dinner! Better yet, it was so affordable! I was caught off-guard as to how inexpensive dinner was. Probably could've ordered a few more rolls if you know what I mean. Given there was only one chef preparing all the food, it can take a while to get your food served to you if there are a lot of people dining at once. So if you decide to order a second round later, make sure you're ready to wait around for it to be prepared. We ordered everything we were planning to eat at the beginning, so we were quite satisfied.\n\nQuality of the fish was great. Wish the shrimp tempura in one of the rolls was crunchier? Tasted a bit soggy - not sure if that was because of the sauce or not.

We'd go on weeknights, after a movie, random Saturday's. It's tiny and it's sort of hit or miss on whether they'll be super busy. It's a husband and wife I believe that own it and they're the only staff too. My suggestion when you order, order big! Get it all in, because it just takes time when you have 1 chef and 1 server. \n\nAnyway, why do I love this place? There are plenty of great sushi spots in SF. Well, maybe it's because this place is just so damn unpretentious. All they care about is serving, simple, very fresh fish and at affordable prices to boot. We always start with their homemade miso soup and edamame, which is perfectly salted. Then we just go home on sashimi and nigiri, split a large Sapporo and get one of the \"special rolls\" - hint they're on the whiteboard behind you near the front door. Btw, we moved away to New York for 4 years and recently came back, hence my review, and the specials are still the same. Ha - but they are very good. Any of the rolls with Mango are insane, can't go wrong. Now that we're in Marin, it seems even more of a treat when we get a chance to visit. We come to the city often, but of course we always want to try something new, visit with friends, etc. but I think we'll be coming back here for as long as they stay open.\n\nFinal note - I don't think we ever sat anywhere else, only the Sushi bar, but that's what we both prefer in general.

I didn't realize that 4 years later, it would start off as and continue to be the best sushi in San Francisco. The husband-wife team are excellent on the service side and the quality, presentation, and precision of the food is unmatched. They could double prices and I'd still come here/rate it best. I have sent countless friends here for dates, not a good group place, and no one has been disappointed. If there are a few people in the restaurant, the waitress will tell you it will be 45 minutes or more for sushi. In fact, even if you are first in line when they open it will usually be 30-40 minutes before you get the main portion of your meal. While waiting order a drink and a side, good things are worth waiting for. As long as this place is open, we will come back.", "author": "Michael G."}

The place definitely reminds me of a restaurant straight out of Japan. \n\nLuckily we came here when the Warriors game was going on so they were almost empty (great time to try out restaurants with long waits!). My friend and I were actually the only 2 people in the restaurant at one point. The waitress and chef were both so friendly and very attentive! It was fun to watch the chef carefully make the sushi from the sushi bar.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple they don't have too many of those crazy combinations which seems more authentic. I ordered 3 rolls for $5 each - salmon, tuna, unagi (eel). They were all so noticeably fresh! My friend got the salmon salad for $8. I think the prices were very reasonable considering the quality. Although I still didn't feel full after 3 rolls.\n\nI was surprised that the tuna roll had wasabi inside while the other 2 rolls I ordered didn't. Make sure you mention to not add it if you don't like wasabi! You also have the option to order your roll with brown rice (my friend loved it). Will definitely be back here and recommend to others.", "author": "Linda X."}

When you are in a sushi pinch and don't wish to fork out $100+ (per person) at a high-end sushi bar, it's ok to come here! The downsides are twofold. Firstly, do not expect anything fancy or top notch.  Fish are not purchased from Tsukiji Market. Secondly, you need to have patience or time as the wait can take up to an hour. So do not expect to be fed promptly. Bring a book to read or a friend to shoot the shit.\n \nThe sushi chef and the server, both Japanese, made up the entire crew. The assortment of fish they carry cannot get any simpler than this. We are getting down to brass tacks in a no frills environment. Wayo reminded me of a sushi restaurant straight out from the 90s that looked like a diner. I was perched precariously on one of those backless stools at the sushi bar. Time seemed to have stood still and so did some of their prices. It was a hole-in-the-wall alright but herein was their old world charm although with none of the remnants of the 90s raucous crowd that used to chase outlandish rolls with sake bombs!\n\nWhen I say brass tacks, I was referring to the run-of-the-mill maguro ($5), hamachi ($5), shake ($5), ebi ($4), ika ($4). tako ($4) and the like.  Don't get me wrong! The sushi was not inedible albeit lackluster. Didn't I say it would be a good place to come when you are in a pinch? The priciest nigiri sushi was amaebi ($7), ikura ($6) and uni ($7). I was surprised there were no white fish, even like the common hirame (flounder) or tai (sea bream).  Don't even think about hikarimono sushi where the fish has a silvery skin like kohada (gizzard shad), aji (mackerel), iwashi (sardine). The basic yellow fin tuna and hamachi were as expected, middle of the road. There was no question about their freshness only that they got boring after a few pieces. No amaebi heads, no ankimo, no hamachi kama....nada! Sushi rice was fine though not great but with perfect fish to rice ratio. For the health conscious, Wayo offers a brown rice option!\n\nIn summing up, Wayo has cheap fresh sushi. A little more variety would be a definite plus. I can see the reason for the long wait. The chef is a tad slow even though he  works his butt off. It may be wise of him, although not necessarily a smart business move, to turn away his customers right off the bat if they can't wait. \n \nGochisosama deshita (Thanks for the meal!)", "author": "Geoff G."}

They don't have the rare stuff and they don't have anything particularly fancy, but when it comes to the basics, they do it right.

We went around 6:30 on a Thursday and were a few of the only people in there, but it did start to fill up around 7-7:30.\n\nThe menu is very simple, but there are plenty of choices as long as you're not looking for anything fancy or over-the-top. We had a few orders of sashimi, which was great, and some basic rolls. The fish was excellent quality, which is the most important thing when it comes to sushi.\n\nAs others have said, this place is very minimally staffed. There was only one waitress when we were there, and she seemed very busy even before the place filled up with customers. Because I read the reviews, I expected to spend a while here and planned accordingly.

They directly tell you it takes 1 hour for the food to come to ensure you are okay with it. So we got a couple rolls (snow leopard, alaska, and dragon), as well as salmon and scallop nigiri. We indeed waited for awhile, though it felt more like 40m than 1 hour.\n\nIn short, the sushi was nothing special. The chef put too much wasabi on the nigiri pieces, and the rolls had little flavor and too much rice. I am surprised people recommended the snow leopard, it was probably the worst roll out of the three we ordered. It ended up being about $20 per person, not expensive but I can get the same quality sushi for cheaper at Nara Sushi on Polk St that takes less than 10m to prepare even on busy nights. \n\nThe service and ambience were great, but I don't think we'll be coming back again.", "author": "Elisa L."}

The host and the chef. We sat down immediately on a Friday night, and the host said our order will take approximately 45 minutes. (Ouch) But we decided to wait. We sat at the bar and ordered the unfiltered sake, which we both really enjoyed. Since we sat at the bar we could watch the chef make roll after roll after roll, to say the least, the chef himself was on a roll, he wouldn't stop making sushi. And he was calm, cool and collected throughout, as the orders kept coming in. (Pretty cool). I asked to take a picture, which he very politely agreed to. Anyway, approx 45 minutes later our food arrived. It was a beautiful variety of fresh sashimi and delicious! Tasted like, \"butta!\"  Once the bill came I felt a bit sticker shocked at $90 for 2 of us, but the quality and freshness of the fish was well deserved. We ordered edamame ( it was warm and lightly salted) YUM and 4 sashimi dishes, 1 roll and 2 glasses (each) of sake.

Was so shocked he picked it up with his hands rather than take the plate back or use chopsticks that I was literally speechless. Also concerned that fish that had been sitting on our table and perhaps touched by our own chopsticks may then be served to someone else. Absolutely disgusting. Previously gave them a two star, but the more I discuss this with friends, feel a one star is the most appropriate review.\n\nPrevious review:\n\nI try to avoid ratings lower than three stars, but this place was so extremely disappointing. People trickle in because of the great location, but even with the restaurant only half full there was still a thirty-forty minute wait as there is only one chef and one server. The quality of the fish is not bad. The cut of the fish is inconsistent, with some pieces thicker than others. The rice also did not seem to have the right consistency, which is critical for good sushi. The warm sake tasted of cheap quality. Most disappointing part of the meal was that the sashimi was served on a bed of heavily seasoned lettuce and seaweed. It begged the question of whether the chef knows anything about fish, as the seasoning overpowered (and smothered) the taste of the fish. This was also the first time fried shrimp head was not available with an order of sweet shrimp... probably because they don't have enough people to provide such service. Most surprising part of the meal was when the chef came to our table and removed part of our order with his bare hands because he gave us the wrong piece of fish!

The place has some tables and a sushi bar, but space is definitely a premium after 7 pm. We wanted to try a little bit of everything, so we ordered some appetizers, nigiri, and rolls. Here's how it went:\n\n- Snow leopard roll, which has seared albacore and ponzu dipping sauce. Pretty bomb and pretty fresh.\n- Hiyayakko, which is cold tofu with green onions, dried bonito flakes and a little bit of ponzu sauce. We added this order last and it was a nice way to end the meal.\n- Spicy tuna roll and spicy yellowtail roll. Definitely preferred the spicy tuna roll. Spicy yellowtail was not spicy at all.\n- unagi roll. I didn't eat the unagi roll but bf reported it was seared pretty well.\n- uni nigiri and salmon nigiri. Uni was super good--one of the best I've tasted. The salmon was pretty fresh too and the slice was pretty generous.\n\nWe also got miso soup and salad--forgot which item it came with.\n\nThere was only one server and one sushi chef.

They said it would be a 45 minute wait, and it took about 30. But if it took 45, I'd be alright with that, because they told me it would take that long. If it took 50 minutes, I'd be understanding, because it's five minutes. Don't come here if you'll flip out over five minutes.\n\nWe drank sake while we waited, enjoyed a conversation, enjoyed watching two people run their business, and enjoyed being in a small room of people doing the same.

It's like the saying, \"Once you go black, you never go back.\" I don't know from experience but the same thing applies, once you've been spoiled with high caliber sushi it's hard to go back to mediocre sushi. \n\nSo why even go to Wayo?\n\nTwo reasons: \n1) Cheap Sushi ($80 for two people which is cheap; I normally spend $80-$100/person);\n2) You can substitute Brown Rice in any of the rolls and nigiri. \n\nWayo Sushi is a hole-in-the-wall, Japanese owned and operated sushi restaurant. It's strictly a sushi restaurant with Salad ($3.50-$9.50), Sashimi ($9-$12), Maki ($3.50-$5.50), Nigiri ($4-$7) and Rolls ($6-$11.50) on the menu. CC's are accepted and there's a $10 minimum per a person. It's relatively small with just 4-5 tables and counter seating. \n\nService is already SLOW so if I came on a busy night and had to wait 40 minutes - 1 hour for my sushi (like other Yelpers), my rating would have probably been lower. I know it's a one-man show but so is Ino, Okina, Kiss Seafood, and Tekka and service is much faster there; hence the rounding down on my rating. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n*Salmon Sashimi (6 pieces - $12) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=rOpocpGTCC2J37DuMhma5Q#rOpocpGTCC2J37DuMhma5Q\nAll the sashimi were PRE-CUT and pulled from a tray (we sat at the counter). I've never seen any sushi bar do this which made me weary. The salmon was silky smooth though and a good value for $2 bucks a pop. \n\n*Hamachi Sashimi (6 pieces - $12) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=rOpocpGTCC2J37DuMhma5Q#UgayRgsyJEhCgCCKUukN5w\nOk so everyone raves about the hamachi here but WHY? Maybe we came on an \"off\" night but the hamachi had a fishy finish. No bueno. \n\n*Brown Rice Dynamite Roll w/ Spicy Tuna & Avocado Topped w/ Tobiko ($6) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=rOpocpGTCC2J37DuMhma5Q#n_vzb68i1851zE72s4Z1ww\nA roll you can feel good about eating, the tuna was nicely firm and the avocado buttery with a nutty flavor from the brown rice. It was a good filler. \n\n*Brown Rice Dragon Roll w/ Shrimp Tempura Topped w/ Unagi & Avocado ($10.50) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=VbdTX3WJ9JLPfRq-btSmTA#Nk1szHk1MAVSrpyRe-SuEg\nI'm not a fan of rolls but the Dragon roll is usually another good filler. You can never go wrong with rich eel, fried shrimp, and buttery avocado except I wasn't a fan of this one. The shrimp tempura was previously fried and reheated causing the tempura to be semi-soggy.\n\n*Unagi (Eel- $5) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=VbdTX3WJ9JLPfRq-btSmTA#sfpBBv5QMwtiqCjGyKulJA\nUnagi is usually rich and fatty, this one was much leaner. Wasn't a fan of the shari (sushi rice) which was too sweet and ruined the integrity of the fish/seafood of all our other nigris as well. \n\nKani (Snow Crab - $5.50) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=VbdTX3WJ9JLPfRq-btSmTA#7Th_0WrCw8A5GTBTTngnfw\nAlthough the snow crab was tenderly sweet, the sweetness from shari was overwhelming.\n\n*Hotate (Scallop - $5.50) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=VbdTX3WJ9JLPfRq-btSmTA#Q2MYk5P8cPVK2oaoILibVQ\nPlump and meaty with a delicate sweetness. \n\nAmaebi (Sweet Shrimp - $6) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6G4fFuwx_hQOMxvZPmqjw?select=VbdTX3WJ9JLPfRq-btSmTA#8dbFIVMEcVjtRMevIADY_g\nSweet as it should be but it had a slimy texture.

There is only one chef who only speaks Japanese and one waitress, who speaks English. It feels like a very mom and pop shop. When we entered this place, the waitress told us immediately it would take 45 minutes for food. So if you decide to come here be prepared to wait for your food. What's interesting is that all rolls/ makis are just $6 (for 5 or 6 pieces) and nigiri is $7 for two pieces with the exception of items like the rainbow roll which is $11. It's surprisingly cheap so that you can sample a lot but each piece of sushi is small. So don't come here expecting to get full unless you order maybe 4 rolls per person. My friend and I ended up sharing 5 rolls amongst each other. They were really good! The sashimi is warm and so you definitely know it's fresh. It was yum! I don't know what authentic Japanese sushi is but if I had to guess this sushi was pretty close to it. We ordered the hamachi maki, rainbow roll, dynamite roll, snow leopard roll, and some roll with saw on the white board with mango and raw salmon.\n\nThey were all great and id recommend the rainbow roll and the hamachi maki.\n\nTip is that in addition to the main they have some special rolls on a plastic stand on the table and also some things on the white board near the entrance.", "author": "Derrick C."}

So don't be a rush and don't be a d*ck about wanting quick in-and-out service, go elsewhere. \n\nThis is the PERFECT place to go for a leisurely meal or go during off hours and it will probably take 15/20 minutes but it is worth the wait!!  The sushi was some of the freshest I have ever had, the fish was cut masterfully, the wasabi was fantastically spicy, and the price point literally can not be beat. \n\nWe started with a bunch of appetizers to hold us over the ~45 minute wait (which we were warned about) for the sushi.  The edamame was warm and salted, the seaweed salad was on point and the cucumber and crab salad was amazingly sweet and tangy (fresh crab!!).  \n\nI ordered the sake sashimi and the hotate nigiri and the BF ordered the mango/spicy tuna roll and the hamachi roll.  The sake was amazing-melted in my mouth and were quite generously cut.  The hotate was also delicious (i gave one piece away and wished I had ordered more).  I tried the mango/spicy tuna roll and it was not diced tuna, but cut and rolled with ripe mangos with a spicy sauce (not mayo based I think).  They also offer brown rice with their rolls, which is an (oddly) rare offering in SF.  \n\nWe also had a beer/cold sake and I wish they had more wine (just chardonnay) but I think they may be BYO.. \n\nLOVE LOVE will be back!", "author": "Raina D."}

The small restaurant was about half full. Since there was only one sushi chef, we were told we would have to wait for 45 minutes to an hour after ordering for our sushi to come, and that was pretty accurate - we ordered and waited an hour. The sushi itself is a great deal. Most rolls are $6! You get 5-6 pieces per order. And these are the real deal - rolls with salmon, tuna, avocado, and tobiko. They were all pretty good with a good amount of fish given the prices!\n\nThere was also only one server, but she was able to work the whole place pretty well. She refilled our water really often.

I am always in mood for sushi so I ventured into this little restaurant. \n\nFirst impression was mixed. On one hand, I was happy to find a small local restaurant ran by a genuine Japanese couple. On the other hand, restaurant was rather quiet at that point and there were no Japanese customers. The menu also offered too many fusion rolls for my comfort. \n\nI decided against getting any of their rolls and went for a straight nigiri fare. 13 pieces later, I was happy and satisfied. The nigiri were authentic. Good sushi rice, perfect fish to rice ratio and all in small bite size pieces. Even the quality of the fish was much better than I have expected. The shiro maguro that night was excellent. The uni was fresh. Hotategai, kani and amaebi all nice and sweet. I also appreciate how everything was served in the logical order starting with lighter shiromi (white fish) and slowly progress to stronger flavors.\n\nI like the intimate ambiance of the restaurant. If you sit right at the sushi bar you get to watch the chef in action. He is a man of few words but works diligently (despite a bit slow) to prepare your delicious meal. Customers were later informed of a longer wait (40 minutes) for sushi and that eventually turned away some potential customers. Those who were willing to wait, will be rewarded in my opinion. Food was good and the price was very reasonable. \n\nEven though I can't give Wayo a solid 4 stars review, I still highly recommend this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-03", "description": "A solid, unassuming find. Eons ago, I used to frequent a hole-in-the-wall on Church everyone called No Name Sushi. Yeah, you remember it. It was the ideal spot for the 20-something looking for fresh cheap sushi, and you could brown bag your own beer. I heard it went downhill and finally closed after a fire about six years ago. Flash forward to the present and I am no longer a cherubic youth living from paycheck to paycheck. Now I am an aging curmudgeon who can afford fresh sushi every now and then. When I entered Wayo, I had a flashback to No Name though it's much tidier. You can tell it was once a coffee shop once since it's dominated by a U-shaped counter (photo: http://bit.ly/1g55kZF) and offers only a few tables next to the front window. With no support staff, this compact spot is run solely by a couple much like Ino Sushi in J-Town, even if it does look a bit like Mel's.\n\nThere were three of us, ravenously hungry, and surprisingly, we were able to saddle up at the counter with ease. It was a relatively quiet weeknight, so we were able to watch the chef displaying his artistry right in front of us. We started by sharing a couple of salads - the $9.50 Spicy Tuna with Avocado (photo: http://bit.ly/1dsGX8o) and the $8 Salmon (photo: http://bit.ly/1guzk1O). The sashimi pieces were fresh, but the presentation itself was nothing too exciting since the fish was simply sitting on top of just chopped Romaine leaves. The nigiri sushi, on the other hand, was near-flawless thanks to the pure freshness of the fish. At $5 for every two pieces, the Maguro (Tuna) and Hamaichi (Yellowtail) were flavorful and thick with great texture. The specialty rolls turned out to be the better deal. The $6 Dynamite Roll (six pieces) offers spicy tuna and avocado topped with a dab of tobiko, a sort of California roll with a kick.\n\nMeanwhile, the $11.50 Sea Fairy Roll was a true California roll with the luxury of a tobiko-accented scallop on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1asU59g). More plates of nigiri sushi came in the form of Shiro Maguro (Albacore Tuna, $5 for two pieces) and Sake (Salmon, same price) (photo: http://bit.ly/191jpby). We wrapped our meals up with a quartet of Ikura nigiri (Salmon Roe, $6 for two pieces) (photo: http://bit.ly/1hkXEGl), a couple of Tako (Octopus, $4 for two pieces) (photo: http://bit.ly/1a5u5oe), and a couple of the velvety Uni nigiri (Sea Urchin, $7 for two pieces) (photo: http://bit.ly/1a5u5oe). That was a whole lotta fish for three people but well worth the ultimately hefty price tag. I had no complaints on what we had, but I was a bit surprised at the omissions - no tamago (egg), no toro (tuna belly), and no ankimo (monkfish liver) - in case you were looking for deeper variety.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...grade-A sushi, a bit more variety would be nice\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...the old diner vibe is still there, but it's more about the sushi\nSERVICE - 4 stars...the wife is ever-patient, the husband a true master\nTOTAL - 4 stars...one of the diner...uhh, I mean finer sushi places in town", "author": "Ed U."}

It's a wonderfully humble operation, and you can tell that it's geared towards quality and love of the craft. \n\nThe menu is perfect -- simple, small, and well-priced. With lack of frills comes great tastiness. I had the best sake sashimi I've ever eaten, and I can admit to probably depleting much of the world's salmon population with my taste for the stuff. The nigiris I tried were perfection on rice. I can recommend the shiro maguro and hamachi for sure. The pieces are arranged simply on a plate without any extra stuff. No decorative leaves or fancily sculpted lemon bits; you are just presented with the good stuff.  \n\nThe spicy tuna was de-licious. Many places tend to under-spice the tuna, but Wayo certainly kicks it up with plenty of spicy bite. We also tried one of the mango rolls I heard so much Yelp about, and they did not disappoint. Perfect balance of flavors, and you can choose from a few different combinations with fish and crab. \n\nNot sure if they've considered hiring one more person to work the joint -- I only saw one chef and a lovely woman taking orders. One customer was told that he would have to wait 40 minutes for food which seemed excessive; the place wasn't extremely busy. I guess that just goes to show that patience leads to delicious. \n\nDefinitely set aside an evening to check out Wayo. They open at 6PM during the week. I was able to arrive right when they opened so my mother and I enjoyed some nice alone time at the bar for about 20 minutes before other diners came.  Simply lovely!", "author": "Chelsea B."}

There wasn't a wait at Wayo and it's so casual, there was a party of girls that came in shortly after we did, and they were in workout clothes - I love that!  Along with that, just know going in that the rolls and fish options offered are the basics; nothing wrong with that though!\n\nBetween the two of us, we shared yellowtail sashimi, two spicy scallop handrolls, a dynamite roll, a shrimp tempura roll, a cucumber crabmeat salad, and a house salad with their Italian/Japanese dressing.  It's worth mentioning that the crabmeat on the cucumber salad was fresh (not imitation) and delicious.  I really liked the dressing on the house salad and was pleased that it came with mixed greens and avocado too.  Of all of the sushi, I think we both enjoyed our spicy scallop handrolls the best, but it was all good.  \n\nWe washed it all down with green tea and sake.  All of that for under $30 a person - not bad!\n\nSince you read this far, I'll clue you in on a little hint I learned from Natasha years ago: order a side of ponzu sauce and dip your sushi in that instead of soy sauce.

Real crab meat. Mango and avocado specials worth trying. As others have noted, unless you come for lunch or right at the start of dinner, you'll probably have to wait a while for your sushi. We came in after spending the entire afternoon walking all over SF, so it was actually super-pleasant to take a load off and snack on some appetizers, so the ~40min wait went by in the blink of an eye.\n\nDefinitely making this a regular stop when I'm back in town.", "author": "myrrh l."}

Why you ask? Well it is no surprise to people that knows my huge affinity towards sushi and wherever I travel I try to find a consistent sushi joint that I can hit up. I appreciate the high class sushi joints but there is something special about a no frills joint that is just focused on the quality of their fish. This place is exactly that type of joint. It is a small joint on Van Ness with limited seating so I can see how the line would be long on certain days. Parking is not bad as there are plenty of metered spots all around the surrounding streets. \n\nWe walked in on a Sunday and were greeted promptly by a waitress. The menu here is focused on and concise which I appreciate. It also makes sense given there is pretty much one sushi chef and one waitress running the entire shop. Each order of nigiri comes with two pieces and the prices are extremely reasonable here. After perusing the menu we decided to have one order of each nigiri (don't judge) and one roll along with a plethora of hot sake of course. The hot sake was brought out promptly and standard. The roll is something that was solid but I am not much of a roll person... why rolls when you can enjoy fresh fish. All of the nigiri was extremely fresh and delicious. The highlight for me was definitely the Hotate nigiri but honestly all were just delicious. My one gripe that is minor is that the rice to fish ratio was just a tiny bit off where they served a bit too much rice with each piece of fish.\n\nI wish I could give this place a 4.5 because the quality of fish is just excellent. Just the rice ratio and the fact that the rolls were just ok (trying to balance out so the review is not too focused on just sashimi). If you are looking for no frills and just good sashimi this is your spot for sure. Definitely check this spot out.", "author": "Dan M."}

Based on the 4 stars, we headed to Wayo. WHY IS THIS PLACE rated 4 stars?! \n\nFirst of all, they don't have sriracha or any spicy sauce for that matter. I was in shock. How is that possible? I hate wasabi or that \"spicy\" powder and have never been denied sriracha or another hot sauce at a Japanese restaurant in my life. \n\nNow onto the service. There were at least 20 people when we arrived. We sat ourselves as there were tables open and no one to seat us. Before saying hello or how are you, the lady simply said, \"it will be 40 minutes wait.\" We say no problem but ask to see a menu and order sake and beer. She gives is the menu... No sake and definitely no beer. A good 10-15 minutes go by and she asks us if we were ready to order. I just sat there... Confused. Anyways, we ordered the food and once again, the drinks. \n\nThe sushi wasn't anything special. In fact, it all tasted the same to us. We had the mango crab roll, mango salmon roll and the cream cheese shrimp roll. For some reason, every roll had wasabi in it. Gross! \n\nGiven the service and the fact that the sushi was pretty bland and in all honesty, didn't even taste fresh, we definitely won't be back!\n\nPlease hire another waitress.

Decided to come here today for lunch with my friend since this place has a decent yelp reviews. There were not that many people during the time when we came. We ordered two rolls and waited forever... okay, I understand there was only one chef... I believe its owned by wife (server) and husband (chef). The lady looked mean and had poor service..\n\nAwhile after, our rolls finally came! My friend and I literally saw a strand of black hair in our roll.. \nI was pretty starving that time.... and I saw my sushi had a hair inside.. ugh.. Okay.. I thought to myself.. okay.. I could wait for the chef to make another new roll for us.. Since I used to work in the restaurants.. I understand sometimes it happens when the food accidently has a strand of hair or whatever in it... I was being considerated so I tried not to put the owner on the spot. I waived to the lady (owner/server) who served us to come to the table and I politely pointed at my sushi, kept my voice down to tell her \"there is something in the roll\". I said \"something\" just cuz I did not want to let other customers hear it. The lady took our plate back and discussed something to the chef in japanese. I was expecting them to make us new roll and apologize. Surprisingly, SHE CAME BACK WITH THE SAME ROLL THAT HAD A STRAND OF HAIR (she just took away that hair from the roll) and explained that was a string from fish... She even tried to say it out loud to let other customers be aware that was something from the fish.....

But the lady asked if it was real snow crab or nasty imitation.  It was real crab, so she ordered some, along with the tuna and shitake rolls.  Best California roll I've had in a long time.  Not mixed with a butt load of cream cheese or whatever, you could really taste the fresh crab.\n\nI had Uni, the Unagi special roll and scallop nigiri.  I never see scallop in other sushi joints, so I had to have it.  Scallops were fresh as could be, smelled great, tasted great.  Unagi special roll was fine, a bit too complex, I should probably lay off the special rolls for a while.

We walked in slightly 7PM on a Tuesday night and sat right down. There were maybe two other tables with customers, totaling about 6 people. I think we came at a good time because by the time we left, all the tables and 1/2 the bar were full. The shop was not well staffed, having only one waitress and one chef, but they were working quickly and with dedication. It would be difficult for them to keep up when the restaurant gets crowded, but at least I know they're not loitering around as it is clear they care about their customers as they race around the restaurant. In any case, I walked in expecting slow service and I think that's the mentality you have to walk into the place with to have a good experience (i.e. don't go when you're in a rush or need to make a movie).  In our case, we were served promptly and had great service. \n\nNow onto the food - we enjoyed our sashimi so much that we added two nigiri orders to our meal:. \n\nOK items; miso soup ($2/bowl), edamame ($3.50 I think), shiro maguro nigiri ($5/2 pieces - added at the end). The shiro maguro was fresh but had a slightly mushy consistency that some fish have that I did not enjoy.\n\nTasty!: hamachi sashimi ($12/6 pieces), sake nigiri ($5/2 pieces), unagi nigiri ($5/2 pieces), saba nigiri ($4/2 pieces - added at the end)\n\n\n- Hamachi was melt in your mouth delicious, I would definitely get this again! 6 pieces cut medium sized (then again I compare that to tekka which is crazy in size) served on a little mound of wakame salad. \n- Sake nigiri - I really liked the ratio of fish to rice on all of their nigiri, it wasn't too much of one or the other and in this case both items were solid. The salmon had a very pleasant flavor and texture. \n- Unagi nigiri - the unagi was served warm and was very soft and delicious. nom nom nom.\n- Saba nigiri - i love the strong flavor of saba and thought that this was very tasty \n\nThe price seemed very reasonable and we're looking forward to coming back soon.", "author": "Karin L."}

As others have mentioned, its a small joint, with just one guy who makes the sushi and a woman who takes orders. We tried calling ahead to order but they didn't answer the phone. We walked in to order, and they told us it would be 40 minutes for pick up. (By now, we were picking up on a vibe that they definitely don't want people to order.) My girlfriend was ready to ditch the whole idea but I thought we should still try it. \n\nWe got: Tuna Nigiri, Alaska Roll (salmon and avocado), California Roll (crab and avocado), Tuna Maki, and the Spicy Tuna Salad. The tuna salad was awesome - huge chunks of fresh tuna. The nigiri melted in your mouth, and the pieces were huge. We really enjoyed all of the rolls. It was worth the wait.\n\nNot a huge deal, but the online menu prices are a little different than the actual prices. It was still affordable, but everything was about 2 dollars more than it was advertised online. \n\nWill definitely be back to Wayo next time we have a sushi craving.", "author": "Alden Q."}

The door was wide open (they open for lunch at noon). I was the first one there. As I walking in, I was met with: \"I'm not ready yet. Another 5-10 min\". That came from their chef. I stood there in a loss and wasn't sure if I should go away or what. Finally, I was invited to sit down. I ordered a couple of sushi rolls and a salad. The sushi seemed to be very fresh but completely lacked flavor. I mean completely tasteless. The chef might consider seasoning the fish that he cooks before it goes in the sushi or use a sous. I'm a seafood and sushi junky. These sushi were so bad that I had to have a corrective experience and had sushi for dinner (not here of course). The place also smells of oil that they use for deep frying. Btw, they raised their prices so the menus pics that you see on yelp are a dollar short. So add a dollar to the cost of every roll.

Sure enough the wait was at least 45 minutes but I endured it with a nice cup of green tea and miso soup and found that the sushi was definitely worth the wait. I loved it.\nI had a few rolls - the california roll with scallop, seared tuna with ponzu sauce, salmon and avocado and tuna with cream cheese. I had actually ordered my rolls and was a bit miffed they didn't have my favorite, salmon and cream cheese until I started looking around and saw the white board that had a WHOLE BUNCH of cream cheese rolls and the mango rolls everyone raves about. \nThe sushi was a dream. Probably not the best sushi I've ever had but totally spot on and much better than I expected. I love wasabi and they are not shy with it here. Some bites of my rolls induced the fire in the nose sensation that only a blast of wasabi can pull off. Kind of like food coaine I guess (I have never tried coke nor will I but the blast of heat in the upper nose must produce a similar sensation followed by euphoria).  \nThe atmosphere also is something I quickly grew to like a lot. Couples and small groups were there having a great time and no one seemed to be bothered by the wait. Situated on Van Ness there was plenty of street traffic and passersby to evoke the fantasy of being in busy Tokyo. \nI am a little befuddled by the owners' insistence on not hiring more help. They must have turned away a dozen would be diners during my visit. It seems to me filling the restaurant every night which they easily could would mroe than pay for the extra help. I don't quite get why they insist doing everything themselves. I can see the sushi chef / owner (?) takes a lot of pride in crafting his sushi and he probably doesn't trust that someone else could do it the same. This kind of reminds of Jiro of \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" fame. I understand that drive and desire for perfection which is such a big part of Japanese culture, but this is the States and I say if there's an opportunity to make more money by hiring a few extra hands the ROI would pay in spades. \nI left with a smile on my face and a new favorite spot in my hood.

I like it. I can actually have a decent conversation without shouting. Service is great! Never needed to ask for more tea or water. Food came fast. \n\nI hear it can get crowded here but when I went it was half full. No problem finding a seat even during dinner time. \n\nDon't forget the daily specials near the entrance.

To be fair, they give you a fairly accurate estimate for how long it will take to get your sushi before you order.  On this particular Sunday night, the estimate was 45 minutes.  We decided that would be okay, since we planned on ordering other appetizers.  We soon realized, however, the problem was the restaurant is way under-staffed for the size.  There is a sushi bar that seats 10-15 guests, and then 3 or four small tables.  For a place that size, you need at least two sushi chefs and two servers.  Instead, there is one of each.  The sushi chef is clearly working hard, but you can only roll so much sushi at a time.  And the one server was running around like mad, taking orders, filling non-sushi orders, running beverage service, bringing checks, running credit cards, etc.  So, it took at least 25 minutes before we got our appetizers.  Even then, we got them at different times so one person was finished with their salad before I got my soup.  And they forgot the edamame until I reminded them, about 35 minutes in.  My sense is this was a couple who run the restaurant together, but they could seriously use an extra pair of hands helping them.    \n\nWe started getting concerned that the sushi wouldn't even arrive within the 45 minute estimate, but it did with a few minutes to spare.  So, I appreciated they were accurate in their time estimate, and it wasn't 45 minutes that bled into an hour.  Once we did get our sushi, it was excellent.  Fresh, generous cuts of nigiri and sashimi, and spicy mango yellowtail roll was delicious.  They could stand to lighten up on the wasabi, or at least blend a bit more evenly so you're not biting into a surprise chunk you can't see in your food.\n\nA nice place, and a place I really want to like, but it just needs more staff!

Feeling the wind tangle my auburn locks, I speed walk around the city.\n\nI like to think that my feet and those handy Yelp stickers found in sometimes the most random of places - will lead me to new adventures and on exciting turns.\n\nMy cheap flip-flops did not let me down today. Heading down busy Van Ness, I spied Wayo Sushi. It was empty, but the beaming red Yelp sticker beckoned me inside.\n\nThe adorable couple working, who I'm assuming are the owners, greeted me right away, with big real smiles. The kind of smile that make the eyes twinkle.\n\nI sat down and began skimming the menu. Wayo's sushi selection is fairly basic, but what's unique about their selection, is that they even offer brown rice sushi rolls. Great, if you're looking to stay away from over-processed white rice. \n\nI ordered the mango-crab roll, the shrimp tempura roll, and the avocado roll. The mango was so creamy and fresh, and the crab has not an ounce of fishy taste. The avocado was buttery and with the brown rice - tasted both \"healthy\" and delicious.\n\nThe sushi chef, was so quick and each roll rolled with love, that I found it hard not to bask in both the attention and warm atmosphere that moved around the place. Him and his wife, kept on eagerly looking over at me to see if I needed anything else, and to make sure I was enjoying my meal.\n\nWhen chefs really care and invest themselves in their food, it's hard not to enjoy it.

The chef puts a ton of cream cheese in it mMMmmMm!!!\n\nI love that there is always free tea, and they are very good at keeping tea filled to the brim throughout the meal.

Wayo Sushi is one of those places.\n\nI live a block and a half away from this place, and just tried it for the first time last week. I went with a friend who just moved to the city, and he was craving sushi. This place has been on my Yelp bookmarks for a very long time. These factors made it the perfect excuse to finally go and check it out.\n\nThe restaurant is VERY small, definitely would not recommend for groups larger than 4, but who knows. They might be able to put a bunch of tables together depending on how busy they are. I came here on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty much full around 8pm. We were seated right away, by a very nice lady. I think this place is a family owned restaurant, and the staff was very pleasant.\n\nThe menu was very simple. They had a couple specialty menus as well, one already placed on the table in a plastic frame (this is where we found tempura rolls which were not on the actual menu), and the other written on a blackboard by the door (I believe they listed all of their mango rolls here). My friend and I started with a bowl of miso soup ($2 I think), and he had some cold sake as well. We each ordered 2 rolls. I ordered the Alaskan and Spicy Tuna rolls (both $4.50 or so). The food arrived not long after we finished our soup, and we were ready to dig in.\n\nYUM! I'm pretty picky about sushi, as I like it to be FULL of flavor. I'm not huge on the seaweed flavor when I eat sushi, and would much rather taste the fresh flavors of the fish. That's exactly what I tasted. It was just the perfect ratio of fish, seaweed, and rice for both of the rolls I ordered. I was so full after the 2 rolls (I think I still had 1 or 2 pieces left that I couldn't eat).\n\nI'm very excited to live so close to such a great sushi place.

The takosu appetizer is delicious with beer. I also liked the cold tofu appetizer, but I do not recall the name. \n\nThere's only one sushi chef so be prepared to wait a while. He hardly ever talks because he is always busy preparing meals! Sometimes I wish he would hire someone else to help so we could all get our food faster but then again having a lone chef is what makes Wayo sushi special.", "author": "Paula U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-17", "description": "Wayo Sushi consistently gets really great reviews on Yelp- between 4 and 5 stars. So I went there once a year ago, didn't like it at all, then went back a second time last week to give it another day in court before writing this review.\nThere is so much excellent sushi to be had in San Francisco--and of all the food I eat when I go out, I eat nigiri and sashimi the most. Therefore, my standards for a 4 or 5 star sushi place may be higher than most, but when I give a score that high you know I mean mouthgasm. The reason I only gave 2 stars to Wayo is that despite the authentic Japanese atmosphere, you should not waste your time on the food or the excruciatingly long wait for it.\n\nHere are the main reasons why:\n1. The fish is just not that fresh. They may load on the wasabi (my first time there wasabi was under the fish on every nigiri piece) to try and mask that fact, but in absence of anything to mask the quality of the fish itself (I only ordered sashimi my second time there)- the fish is meh at its very best. This is reason alone to seek fresh, wonderful fish elsewhere.\n2. The not-so-fresh fish takes forever to prepare. And I mean, at least a 45 minute wait, even if the place is not that packed.\n3. The service is way sub-par. You will probably wait another 20-30 minutes for your check.\n4. They only have one kind of unfiltered nigori sake. It's good, but if you are a sake fan, variety is the spice of life.", "author": "Veronica J."}

After my group, there was just the sushi bar and 1 table for 2 available so this place is small. So seeing as this place was small, I wanted to call in to put in a reservation but after multiple calls, there was still no answer. Fortunately, the place wasn't busy so they were able to accomidate my group by combining all but 1 of their tables.\n\nAnyways, onwards. The place is a 2 person show. 1 sushi chef and 1 waitress. Obviously with a large order, the food is going to take a while especially if it's prepared by just 1 person, so the really long wait was to be expected. The sushi itself was really nothing to write home about. Yeah, it's sushi, it tasted decent. It's not terrible, it's just kind of average. They were pretty inconsistent with the amount of wasabi that went into the sushi. Some pieces of nigiri had a lot more than others and really made it unpleasant. I will say however, that the waitress was pretty nice, and even asked us if we would like to split the check. Overall, for the price, the sushi isn't all that great, and there are other places that are better that isn't a hole in the wall. I will probably  not repeat.", "author": "Damon Y."}

My boyfriend and I were visiting the City and wanted to get some sushi.  So, I whipped out my Crackberry to find a sushi place near our hotel and VOILA!  We were on our way to Wayo Sushi.  Now, it was late (9:30pm and we were extremely hungry) and with us not being familiar with San Fran we had a tough time finding the place, it sort of gets lost next to the Starubucks, but alas we found it.\n\nAs we walked in, we noticed it is nothing like the big commercialized sushi places we are used to.  We found a spot at the bar and sat down.  The ONE sushi chef (owner) let us know that it would be a little bit of a wait, but we were in no rush.  The waitress was quick to get us water an bring us edmame as well as take our order.\n\nThe menu is small and pretty basic, but, I have to say, for the amout of food you get and he QUALITY of the fish, it is well worth it.  We enjoyed the quiet ambiance and low key atmosphere of the place.  We had an order of half tuna half salmon sahsimi, spicy yellowtail roll, snow leopard roll (ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THIS WORLD) and another order of tuna sashimi.  The best part is that with the sashimi you get a little bit of seaweed salad on the side! I have never been a big fan of it, but this place had the best I have ever eaten.\n\nAfter speaking to the owner he let us know he had been there for 22 years!  Obviously, his way of doing business has worked very well.  I applaud him for sticking to simplicity.  I will absolutely visit Wayo Sushi when I am in San Fran next time!", "author": "Amber N."}

Sat down and noticed that it was definitely a bit of a date restaurant. We sat by the bar and we were warned that sushi would take 40 minutes. So smart of us, we ordered appetizers to tie us over and it was great. Miso soup was excellent. Best I've had in a while. Sushi was quite fresh, best saba. Totally low key and totally worth the wait. A guy came in to wait for his to-go order, it took an hour and he was OK with it. We knew it was going to be a good restaurant because of it. Sure enough the sushi was very fresh and very traditional. I liked it because it felt authentic. Nothing worse than not-so-fresh sushi. While we sat down and had tea and water, 2 couples going to the Edwardian Ball (which was tonight) showed up, they looked happy and festive. A few more dates came as well. A good looking man came and sat down by himself. I wondered what his story was. A couple showed up but did not want to wait so they took off, but another couple seemed to know the drill and they were patient and sat down and ordered regardless. My girlfriend (but not my GIRLFRIEND) had a nice time catching up and we felt rejuvenated after the meal. We agreed that clean, fresh, tasty sushi was exactly what the doctor ordered after a fabulous day soaking at Archimedes Banya. It's a bit odd place to find  - was hoping to head over to Russian Hill for sushi, or somewhere on Polk Street. But instead we ended up here, and we were thrilled of this find.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Although this could be considered entertaining to watch this guy multi-task and wear many hats, this also means it will take forever to get what you ordered. Albeit when you do get it, it will be freshly made with good care.\n\nThey only have sushi, so if you're looking for noodles or teriyaki, this ain't for you. The sushi menu is not extensive but it does guarantee you daily fresh offerings. They have unique rolls, like ones the include mango. I also  like the brown rice option for a more nutritious meal.

You get the choice of having brown rice on your sushi?! I loved the concept since I'm usually a big fan of brown rice. The sushi didn't hold up as well as regular sushi though.\n2. Affordable - the prices are incredibly cheap for sushi. $5 for many rolls, including mango rolls which were very interesting.\n3. The tea there was yummmyyy\n\nCons:\n1. A bit of wait for food and service. As mentioned earlier, only a Japanese couple working there and handling everything all at once.\n2. Smaller place.

As others have said, the menu is limited, in that really nice specialized way.  Except for all the jive-ass mango going out.

She sounded like ... \n\nWe ordered cucumber salad (with crab for me, tako for him).  The vinegar for the salad is amazing!  They marinated it just long enough for the flavor to infuse the cucumber, but not so long that it has pickled and wicked away any freshness.  \n\nI ordered amaebi, uni, and ika. I know.  Diversity.  All shellfish.  No fish.  What the wha?  Well, I get fish from the place across the street from work nearly twice a week.  So I needed something different.\n\nAmaebi did not come with fried heads.  Uni was a deeper golden color than I would have liked but he did open the container freshly.  I dunno.  I think I need to limit uni to specific Tanuki instances.  Or Okina.  Or Koo.

It will be fine.\n\nPlace def looks like a hole in the wall.  As we walked in, there was 4 tables it think and a bar with about 6 chairs.  The place looked like a burger joint converted to a sushi restaurant, very small, very quaint.\n\nI looked into the kitchen and my mind was blown as there was no grill or stove it seemed.  I thought, wow, this place is totally dedicated to sushi.\n\nWe looked at the menu and it seemed like the lunch menu but was actually the whole menu.  We ordered the spinach with bonito flakes, the hamachi and sake (salmon) nigiri, and the yelpers recommendations mango and hamachi, and the spicy tuna roll.\n\nThe spinach with bonito flakes was good, but it was basic items put together to make a good dish.  Spinach was blanched, the compressed cold, served with soy sauce, flakes, and some sesame seeds.  It was rather refreshing as it was a hot day.  This appetizer made me excited for the sushi to come.\n\nWe got the mango and spicy tuna first.  Took a bite out of the mango roll and all i could take is mango and rice.  The rice was quite sticky and not very flavored.  I don't want to sound harsh but it seemed like the back-up to the back-up sushi maker was rolling these.  There was a sliver of hamachi which I could hardly taste.\n\nAll sushi was made with this hideous rice.  The spicy tuna . . . wasn't.  Again, the rice made it seem like I was eating an onigiri, or japanese rice ball.\n\nThe nigiri came out next.  Same rice.  Both the hamachi and sake tasted like it was frozen, then thawed out, with the ice crystals diluting the flavor of the meat.  I mean, seriously?  I've had better sushi from korean/chinese owned restaurants deep in San Mateo.\n\nThe sushi wasn't presented in any special way, there wasn't any happiness in that restaurant.  Just seemed like a business to get folks money and get them out.\n\nWayo, way-no, 2 stars.", "author": "Dirk M."}

When I first peeked at the menu on the window, I thought that the choices were very limited but decided to give it a try anyway -- and boy was I glad I did! It was one of the most enjoyable meals at a sushi restaurant that I've ever had. I ordered the Dynamite Roll (spicy tuna + avocado) and the Alaska roll (Salmon + Avocado). One thing that stood out about this place was the rice. YES, the rice. I understand sushi chefs usually take 3 years just to learn how to season the rice just right and the taste was absolutely perfect! The way sushi rice should be. Also, the salmon was fresh and flavorful but packed a punch as the chef put just the right about of unannounced wasabi into the roll. That caught me off guard but the flavors were very well balanced. The spicy tuna roll was one of the best I've had, you don't taste the spicy-ness initially but it gets you towards the second half of chewing. \n\nThis place is definitely quality over quantity. It hit the spot just right and I didn't leave feeling full, bloated, or cheated. The prices are decent for what it is. I will be back soon to try their mango roll creations. \n\nA note about the service, it was very slow because there are only 2 people working, the chef and the waitress.

The bad news is mostly everything else. When we arrived, the sushi chef was the only person working. No server, no one to seat us, no one to take our drink or food order. There were two other parties already seated (one of whom had a super cute baby that smiled easily...bonus!). When we seated ourselves at the last table, the place was at maximum capacity everywhere but at the sushi bar.  Eventually, the sushi chef himself came over and took our order, promptly returning with my Sapporo. \n\nThe menu is short, and for the purist. Standard offerings of nigiri and sashimi, with a few suggested \"speciality rolls,\" none of which seemed all that special. I ordered the Snow Leopard Roll, mainly because I like snow leopards (to look at, not to eat), and asked that they hold the avocado (it gives me a stomachache.) The result was bland, dry and pedestrian. My husband ordered seaweed salad, sashimi, and Uni nigiri, which is one of his favorites. The Uni looked fresh, a relief because old Uni looks like loogies on rice and turns my stomach.

At least, that's what I thought until I stumbled upon Wayo. A very unassuming place staffed by only two employees, the wife handles the waitressing while the husband makes the food.\n\nThe crown jewel of Wayo is the hamachi sashimi. At $9 for five thick fresh slices, this is by far the best deal in town. Each slice consisted of magnificent whitish fish with a stunning rose colored tip. These were served at the perfect temperature to maximize their sweet, milky and buttery flavors. They literally melted in your mouth. Waitress, keep these coming please!\n\nUnfortunately, the crown jewel is the only thing reliable at this sushi joint. Avoid the rolls at all costs. With dry bland rice, damp seaweed and flavorless fish, these were major disappointments. Maybe I came on a bad day, but the uni, maguro, unagi and the special mango rolls all tasted like dusty old shoeboxes. The service is also bit slow, but go ahead, I dare you to piss off a sushi chef and order uni nigiri at the same time.", "author": "Alex C."}

But, there were only about 8 other people in the restaurant so this was not an issue for us.\n\nThe fish came out pretty quickly, and it was all delicious.  We ordered a variety of tuna, some yellowtail, edamame, and a couple of beers for our dinner.  The fish cost us LESS THAN $20.  WHAT??

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-16", "description": "I really like Wayo.  It's a small-- almost very small-- sushi bar right on VanNess Ave.  The storefront is so small that you could easily miss it even if you were looking for it.  \n\nDespite their hours of something like 5-10pm every night of the week (no lunch), there is a good chance you will have to wait for your sushi order if you come during peak dining hours on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.  This is because all of your sushi is made by one authentic Japanese sushi chef.  When this happens to us and the owner warns us of a good 30-40 minute wait for our order, we order right away and sit back with a nice glass of sake and have some edamame and miso soup (no wait).  But at least he is wise and considerate enough to let you know about the wait *before* you start to order.\n\nI think that there is usually no wait if you eat a bit later in the evening and there are no large parties present.\n\nStreet parking in the area can also be very difficult.  All this makes for a bit more effort in getting there and getting situated than some other places. \n\nBut I gave Wayo such a high rating because it does so many things right:\n\n1. Very relaxing, adult, mature atmosphere.  Every once in awhile you get a loud group of obnoxious people, but for the most part it is small groups and couples eating and talking at considerate noise levels.  \n\n2. Good sake.  It goes so well with sushi.\n\n3. Wayo strikes a good balance between quality and value.  It is admittedly not as elite as something like a sushi-ran, but the sushi is consistently good and the prices are fair.\n\n4. Have you ever tried the salmon with brown rice nigiri sushi?  Though they offer something similar at the Whole Foods sushi section, I think that having this along with the other traditional white rice sushi types is a nice contrast at the same meal.  Though not traditional to some sushi purists, there is something about brown rice sake nigiri that is so good.  Try ordering something like this at Ino-sushi and they'll probably throw you out.\n\n5. Sushi places are so often either cheap and unauthentic feeling-- or going the other extreme-- so stuffy, expensive and elitist as to be not fun.   Wayo strikes a very good balance, being a nice, pleasant place that has the elements of class and comfort of the high end places but without the pretension and very high prices.\n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Dave N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-08", "description": "Now days it's very rare for me to walk into a sushi bar and find a place where they are passionate for nigri.  Way to often I come in and I see a massive menu filled with different rolls, sauces and a combination mish-mash of different fish stuffed into a roll.    When I go out and eat sushi I want to be able to taste and appreciate the natural flavor, fat and texture that each piece of fish or seafood provides.  I don't want to have the taste of saracha (Vietnamese red hot sauce, which is great in pho but not in sushi. IMO.) or god forbid to go and make a roll and deep fry the whole damn thing.\n\n I must agree with some of the reviews, at this place it is fairly slow, I was in a party of three and we spent close to about 2 and a half hours eating here.  I will say that if you are hungry to make sure you order a bit heavier on your initial order should you be sitting at the tables, if you try to order a few things at a time you will be in for a longer meal.  That said the shiro maguro, hotate, amaebi, sake (salmon not the drink) , ika, tako and the uni was really really good.  My friends did also try a few rolls, which I thought were decent, but I still felt very satisfied with the quality of nigri.  They do offer a brown sushi rice substitute, which sounds interesting but I think Ill deal with the higher carbs and low fiber for the time being.\n\nThe woman that worked here was very nice and was constantly circulating the room to keep every ones table full.  There was only one chef behind the counter but he seemed very in control and did his best dealing with the number of orders that stacked up and not matter how busy it got, his sushi through out the night was constantly good.  Free parking here can be tough to find, there are a few pay by hour garages, still I think it is a worth while stop if you like sushi, it is hard to find and isn't as visible but that said, I kinda like it that way too....", "author": "Chris T."}

Remember, though, you reviewed it, so it's all your fault!\n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I were delighted to see such a highly rated sushi place within walking distance of our hotel, so we hoofed it over on a Wednesday night and were shocked to find the place empty at 630pm. We were also shocked to hear \"Let It Snow\" playing on the stereo in July, but we won't go there. \n\nThe food was fantastic. No, it doesn't have a huge selection but everything was fresh. We loved the laid back atmosphere, and we also loved that the waitress gave us huge glasses of wine whenever we ordered one.

Wayo packs a serious sushi punch.\n\nYou can tell instantly from the menu that this isn't a place where funky rolls are the highlights. Wayo is about the fish and the genuine art of traditional nigiri which focuses on the fish. Definitely a breath of fresh air and a reminder of why Sushi Rock is simply trash. \n\nI ordered multiple nigiri pieces, and a few specialty rolls. While it does take a bit to get your order ( about 20 minutes with the place being a little less than half full) it was worth the wait.\n\nThe sake and maguro pieces just melted in your mouth. Soft, buttery, and the dash of wasabi under the sushi hood made the pieces fly off the plate. Incredible.\n\nThe service was great, and while it's only 1 person, she does a fantastic job of staying on top of everyone's orders and wishes.\n\nWill come back often and I have to say, I was a little hesitant to write this review because I'd like to keep it somewhat of a sushi secret.

The atmosphere isn't by any means the best point, as it was sparsely decorated and rather plain. There aren't many tables at all and the sushi bar isn't all that big so I expect this place to have big waits on busy nights. \n\nWith that said, the food was really tasty and quite filling for roughly twenty bucks a head. We tried the Dragon roll, the rainbow roll, and the salmon sashimi and then added a salmon roll at the end. The pieces of salmon sashimi were cut big and very fresh and the eel was delicious on the Dragon roll. Out waitress paid just the right amount of attention to us, and, even though we arrived somewhat late, wasn't in a rush to get us out at all. \n\nIt'd probably be a good date place because its not really that loud and pretty casual; unless of course you're looking for a loud place so you don't have to listen to your date mindlessly tell you about themselves ;).", "author": "Danny K."}

The best \"no frills\" sushi I've had in the Bay Area.  \n\nYou walk in, and immediately you notice a couple of things.  \n\n1) Small place, 3-4 tables + sushi bar\n2) 1 Sushi Cheff\n3) 1 Waitress\n\nJust FYI, If you're not the 1st one in the door, the waitress will usually pre-empt your meal by saying, \"It will be a 40-45 minute wait for your food, is that ok?\"  It really does take about that long, but the sushi is no joke.  The chef is a real nice guy, and he's been there for 20 years, so you know this place is the real deal.  \n\nThe best thing about this place is the quality of the fish.  Usually I order a bunch of nigiris, a couple of rolls and I'm usually stuffed by the end of the night.  I love the tuna, salmon, yellow tail, makerel, unagi, albacore, their makis.  Try the snow leopard roll for something different and they also have mango and cream cheese rolls.   However, I stick with the basics.  \n\nAlso, the place is cheap.  It's about $4 per roll/nigiri, so you can really order about 10 different things and stuff yourself for the night for $40 for 2.  Anywhere else you're paying $60-70 for less quality fish but more \"frills\".  \n\n5 STARS!", "author": "Davidson T."}

But here you go anyway: this is no-frills neighborhood sushi joint that doesn't offer much in the way of atmosphere, but they make up for it in value. You're not going to get the Cherry Blossom Double Decker Firecracker roll here, but they've got all the nigiri and maki basics covered.  Their one foray into the exotic is a series of mango rolls they have on special (and have had on special for many months now).  All of these rolls will run you $3-$5.  Not bad at all.  And as mentioned, you can have any of your rolls with brown rice which may be sushi sacrilege but hey, it's a good way to healthy your dinner up a bit and they taste just fine. \n\nEvery time I've been there the staff has topped out at 2 people: a chef and a waitress.

It's hard to pinpoint what makes some sushi better than others when it's all pretty straightforward-- rice, seaweed, fish, maybe one or four other ingredients. But whenver I get a sushi craving and I try a place, I either leave satisfied and not needing any sushi for a couple weeks, or I find that I still crave it... Wayo definitely satisfies the craving!\n\nNo crazy rolls with 12 ingredients, mind you, but simple rolls with fresh, tasty ingredients all in the right proportions, and excellent nigiri. And yes, as far as I can tell the chef is Japanese, or at least not Mexican and not speaking in Korean, which makes him pretty special in this town. That, along with his amazing sushi.", "author": "Amy D."}

But since it was fairly empty we got our food pretty quickly - we ordered quite a few of the rolls and some sushi. The Sea Fairy is my favorite - real big pieces of crab, no mayo, avocado and cucumber with scallops on top. Everything was light, clean, fresh flavors. I also dug the mango yellowtail roll - I've never had mango in my sushi before and it was a yummy combination. \n\nParking was pretty easy too - there was plenty of street parking around the area and it was easy to find. Definitely come by and give this place a try - just avoid the busier hours bc from what I see in some of the other reviews the wait can be pretty long.", "author": "Anita W."}

It was delicious. Honestly, the quality of fish is great and it's one of the least expensive sushi dinners I have ever had. Of course, since you're paying around $5/roll, you don't get tons of fish but you can order more of a variety and still pay less than what you would elsewhere. The only downside is there is one chef and one waitress so you must have a decent amount of time to spend at dinner. The restaurant only has 3 tables so you might end up sitting at the counter if none of those are open. Overall, a great meal, awesome sashimi and great rolls. I will definitely be making this my go-to sushi spot!", "author": "Tenley B."}

It's right on Van Ness and Bush, where there's a sushi restaurant on almost every block.  Not very identifiable due to lack of eye-catching signage, so look for the Starbucks that's right next to it.  Very small place, has about 3 - 4 tables and the bar, that's about it.  You will probably have better luck getting a table fast on a week night.\n\nThe food came slow, and I'm guessing because it's just one chef working there, who basically has to do everything.  The food is pretty good, though not spectacular, but at the price they charge you really couldn't complain --- it's very reasonable.  We tried a bunch of stuff, the highlights for me were the scallops (very tender, sweet and fresh), the amaebi (sweet shrimp), tender and buttery, and the uni was pretty good too.  \n\nThe only downside is the limited selection of fish.

We eat out wayyy too much and we REALLY need to save more money, especially in times like these!\n\nMonday night comes around and we are both really craving sushi. We end up at Wayo, a place we passed by while on our way to BevMo the other day. They have a note on their front door that says they have brown rice for sushi. A few reviews back I made it my mission to find more places offering brown rice sushi. PERFECT! So much for cooking at home.\n\nWe were the first customers of the night (went in at 6pm which is when they open for dinner). The little asian lady greeted us warmly and immediately brought us to a table. Tea and water followed. I was really happy when I saw the menu of basic sushi rolls. Sometimes I want really crazy rolls but tonight I just wanted to taste the fish. We ordered:\n\nRock'n Roll - Sometimes places put too much sauce on this one but Wayo did it perfectly. \n(2) Alaska Roll - I really love avocado and salmon so I had to get two. These were smaller rolls but the fish was still a good size and tasted very fresh. \nUni Nigiri - SEA URCHIN IS SO GOOD! Don't let the name scare you. It almost reminds me of the insides of a crab shell but creamier and more flavorful. You have to try it. And it's so cheap here, only $5! I've paid way more than that for uni.\nSalmon, Cream Cheese, Avocado Roll - This was supposed to come with cucumber but I think the chef forgot. No biggie, just as long as he didn't forget the fish! YUM.\nSea Fairy Roll - My favorite of the night! California roll with scallop on top. I hate to say it but I usually avoid Califorina rolls because the imitaion crab tastes way too fake and creamy but it was amazing here. THEY USE REAL CRAB! And the fresh scallops on top were huge! Most places cut them up so small they don't even look like scallop anymore, NOT here. Served with just a dot of creamy sauce on each piece, you could taste how fresh everything was and how great it all went together. \n\nWe requested that all these rolls be prepared with brown rice. When I was at Homma's Brown Rice Sushi in Palo Alto, they used too much rice vinegar and it ended up tasting too tangy. At Wayo, they didn't use any at all so it was just regular brown rice instead of sushi brown rice. This was my only complaint of the night. \n\nThough the brown sushi wasn't what I expected, everything else was wonderful. Louis Armstrong playing in the background. Clean and warm environment. Quick service even with two people (the chef and the waitress) working and even after other customers had come in, the lady was still very attentive. They have exellent fish that make up their simple yet flavorful sushi rolls. Lastly affordable prices. Cheapest sushi in the city that doesn't compromise or skimp on anything.

The nori was a bit chewy, the chef probably should have crisped it up a little more.  It was still tasty though, I ordered more after I finished my first round.  I had some ebi maki (shrimp rolls) and could barely taste the shrimp.  The fish could have been a little fresher and a little more care could have been put into the creation of the items.\n\nI don't mean to harp on all the bad things, sushi is such a simple yet extremely complex food, that its much easier to identify things that are done wrong than praise whats done well.\n\nI left there full and satisfied, it was pretty inexpensive so it was worth the price.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was really craving sushi and walking down that specific block of van ness.

They recently raised their prices making it your standard sushi price so I suggest going to somewhere better at the same price. The wait is super long if they have more than 4 tables. They only have one guy making sushi so it makes sense. I've seen the place packed and they tell people sushi will take 1.5 hours or more. People seemed shocked and leave. It's almost commical because I've been in there so many times where they quote people over an hour and the party seems super confused and leaves. Pretty average place, the draw was cheap prices but now that's gone.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Everyplace else in the city either has cheap crappy sushi or good expensive sushi or expensive crappy sushi (I'm looking at you Union Square).  I also like the no-nonsense menu.  Its pretty straight forward and easy.  This isn't a line sushi place where there are three or more sushi chefs working, so be patient with the man behind the counter.  \n      My one issue with the place is that they need a message on their phone when they aren't open (I order out a lot here).

Wayo is my \"go to\" sushi place -- consistently good with really fresh fish, perfectly chewy rice, and creative rolls.  The Sea Fairy Roll is the best roll that is NOT on the menu. It is on the \"specials\" menu sitting on the tables. This roll has a fresh scallop on essentially a California Roll with fresh crab and avocados.  Other good rolls are also NOT on the menu -- Spicy Hamachi Mango and Spicy Tuna Mango.  The service can be a bit slow, because it is only one waitress/helper and one sushi-chef.  So, make sure you get your order in quickly, as he makes all the rolls for an order based on the order that he receives the order.

They also have a few simple donburi's--I like the shrimp tempura one best.  The sauce they use for the donburi's is awesome and perfect over steamed rice--so awesome that you don't even need much meat or sides to enjoy the dish with.  They also always have a list of specials up on the wall.  The service can be a bit slow since there's only 1 sushi chef working and 1 waitress.  I believe they may be a wife/husband team.

Be sure to try some miso soup, the seaweed salad and, if they still have it, the mango salmon roll--amazing!

My favorite has been Sushi, and I have four Black and Japanese brothers, so sushi has always been a mainstay.  However, there is only one place that I truly love for the best sushi in this city, and it is found here, at Wayo Sushi.  My first date with my true love was held at the table in the corner, over sushi.  The fish and all offerings are fresh daily, and once we were invited in to wait until the delivery of fresh fish arrived.  It came fifteen minutes after we were there, and we waited for the Sushi Chef to cut and prepare the offerings, before we ordered.  I do mean fresh!!!  I could eat here daily, but my finances won't allow it, though there prices are reasonable.  They have many great offerings, but the best is anything made with the brown rice instead of white.  I have never been a brown rice fan, but this is one of the only places that I eat it and love it.  For those who can't have high sodium, they even have a low sodium soy sauce offering.  The Chef's Special is great, and so is their green tea ice cream, and sake.  I love the miso soup, and his wife works with him during lunch when she is not in Japan, and he has a wonderful assistant at night during the dinner shift.

No joke. Been there 5 or six times with same experience - a basically empty restaurant and this vapid lady telling us we'd have to wait 45 mins. Weird.  This place is ridiculous. I am not writing because of \"one\" experience - this is based on a dozen times going there and other reviewers agree. The people who run it are ... as I've said ... nice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-24", "description": "Sushi is about the fish. Specifically, its about the freshness of the fish. Thus far, Wayo has some of the freshest fish of all the sushi places I've been to in SF. Admittedly I haven't been to every sushi joint in the city (read: I only go to cheapo sushi locations), but I'm fairly certain Wayo has the best freshness:affordability ratio. Sushi restaurants fall under two categories. \"Hip\" sushi bars that specialize in a thousand varieties of silly named rolls (Barrel Roll, Lead Roll, Look-at-me-I'm-on-a-Roll), that are usually drowned in mayonnaise and then deep-fried and \"traditional\" Japanese restaurants that make you feel like committing hari-kiri for keeping your shoes on during dinner. Wayo is neither. It's a down to earth eatery that serves honest food by  a committed chef. The slices of fish on the nigiri are extremely generous and his rolls are simple and flavorful. And if you're lucky, you'll get to see the World's Biggest Teapot lugged around by a very tiny woman.", "author": "Raymond P."}

We used to go to Kyoto if Wayo was already closed but the quality of Kyoto's sushi made us give up that habit.  Wayo puts Kyoto's crap to shame.  The sushi is always extremely fresh - one of the few places I feel comfortable eating sashimi.  They do not have a ton of \"special\" rolls, just basic good sushi.  I've been working my way through the salads over time - all have been fantastic (cucumber salad with octopus, spicy tuna and avocado salad, crab and mango salad to name a few).  The atmosphere is quiet with soft jazz playing and the chef has a very sweet energy and is very good at what he does.  His presentations are almost food art.  For having to pay Van Ness rent the sushi is very affordable.  We always feast for about $20 a person including a beer or some sake.  This is the perfect place to take an out of town guest who can't get sushi where they live, without all the noise and sketchy service of a place like Sushi Rock.  One note, this is a \"mom and pop\" sushi bar with 3 tables and a few seats at the bar.  If you go at a busy time be prepared for a wait...but hang out, order some edamame and a beer, watch the artist at work and relax.  It's TOTALLY worth it!!", "author": "Jon B."}

I'm not a huge sushi fan but my friend is and I'm basing it solely on their non-raw fish options (yeah, I know, who goes to eat sushi and don't get raw fish, right?). So, I got their California Roll and New York Roll, both were very good in my opinion although I'll probably get their Snow Leopard Roll as well on top of those two since it sounded interesting. Their non-raw fish options are limited, so if you're going to be bringing someone who doesn't like it, I would recommend them getting the California Roll and New York Roll (not sure if Snow Leopard Roll is cooked, or at least cooked all the way through). If you're a sushi fan, I would recommend it, albeit not from personal experience, since my friend is a huge fan and have tried it both here in San Francisco and Japan. It is also rather inexpensive when it comes to sushi as well, so I highly recommend this place for both quality and price. The atmosphere is nice, although a bit small. There's a bar/counter that can seat about 15 people and 3-4 tables that can seat 2 people. The one night I did go there though, it wasn't crowded at all and the wait time wasn't that long. It took about 30 minutes (maybe a little less) for our food to be served when they weren't busy. As many others have stated, it is only one chef and one waitress working, so I'm not complaining.
