How does it differ from other takeout dimsum places? The dumplings stay intact. I've noticed at other dimsum places, the dumplings have been oversteamed to the point where the clear wrapping starts sticking to other dumplings, thus ripping the dumpling apart. \n\nParking on Irving is metered parking, but I normally circle around the residential areas until I find free parking.", "author": "Charissa S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-20", "description": "This review has been a long time coming.  In this case though, it's not because I came here years ago and never got around to writing my review.  Rather, it's because I came here years ago, have been back countless times since then, and I STILL haven't written my review.  It's subtle, but there's a difference - this is an ongoing thing!  You know, just in case I decided to give a different rating.  Yeah, that's why I haven't done this until now...ha!\n\nNow, despite what their name might suggest, Happy Bakery isn't your \"cakes and cookies\"-sort of bakery.  Rather, think more like har gow and siu mai, as it's more of a \"dim sum to-go\" type of joint.  What sets them apart from similar spots along Irving, though?  The other half of the business - a Chinese to-go counter where you can get a bunch of deli staples, such as chow fun, chow mein, fried rice, fried chicken wings, sweet & sour pork, braised tofu, and so much more (though no char siu, roast duck, or roast pork, unfortunately).\n\nWhile I've picked up food from both of their counters, I frequent their dim sum one far more often.  Not that any of their hot foods that I've tried have been bad; in fact, their drumsticks and wings are actually pretty solid (crispy, albeit oily).  It's just that nearly all of the other hot foods I've tried have been unremarkable, like their chow mein.  On the other hand, I've enjoyed nearly everything from their dim sum side, especially their siu mai (meaty, juicy) and fairly unique sticky rice balls (SO GOOD!).\n\nThough I can see how people may not be overwhelmed by the food here, I find it surprising that so many people have shaved off stars because of the service.  Beyond how I've never had any problems, shouldn't it be kind of expected that workers aren't going to be overly friendly, given the reputation of Chinese eateries.  Sure, they skip the pleasantries, but it's not like they're outright rude.\n\nBased purely on taste, Happy Bakery fits the exact definition of a THREE AND A HALF STAR rating - three stars for the Chinese deli side, four stars for the dim sum side.  However, factoring in their prices (3 items for $2.20-$2.50, depending on what you choose), it's an easy call to round up to four.  Even though traditional dim sum joints might taste better, it's hard to argue with paying half the price (or less!) while eating from the comfort of my own home.", "author": "Mike L."}

Nope, same thing.  The chicken/mushroom/boiled egg steamed bun didn't have any real taste - the buns on Clement St/6th ave are a lot tastier with tastier filling/sauces.  The shrimp dumplings were barely filled with tiny shrimp and the dumpling pouches themselves came apart easily with holes in them.  \n\nThe eatery isn't bad, but it doesn't compare as far as portion size & tastiness to Sweet Delight bakery on Mission St/Excelsior or even Wing Lee on Clement St.", "author": "Frugal C."}

TC Bakery across the street also sells 3-item dim sum at a cheaper price too. With that said, Happy Bakery has a larger and better selection of entrees and smaller dim sum items. They sell at least 6 different kinds of noodles here and some amazing deep fried chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "We made the mistake of buying dim sum from this place instead of TC Bakery which we found out after the fact is across the street!  We're familiar with the TC Bakery location in Daly City; we like their dim sum as its consistent and very affordable.  However, we  got our wires crossed from hearsay information from a family member who raved about a dim sum place by '25th & Irving'.  Unfortunately we weren't given the name & we neglected to ask not realizing there are two of them on the same block but across the street from the other.  And wow we sure made an expensive mistake.\n\nFirstly, as is typical, there is non-service.  One is lucky if the dim sum clerk acknowledges you with your non-Cantonese/non-Chinese knowledge.  But the clerk was okay (for this type of place).  I read some older reviews of the nasty service, but maybe we're so used to the typical lack of courtesy that's commonplace in Chinese places we're immune to it now.  But honestly the clerk could have been worse.\n\nThe worst thing was the dim sum itself.  We wasted $38 on food that was poorly made and tasteless.  The har gow looked attractive as it was large, however, it tasted of rice flour mostly since there was hardly any shrimp; the shrimp mixture only had a few chopped pieces of bamboo shoot-no water chestnut nor sesame oil as TC's.  The baked BBQ pork buns were awful.  The dough was pasty, and the filling was not only orangey but the meat was tasteless.  There was a smaller steamed bun that had veg. & pork filling; however, the potstickers had the exact same mixture.  And the potstickers were the worst ever I've tasted.  The dough was thick and chewy & very unpleasant like stale.  The siu mai was just okay.  \n\nThus, definitely we'll never return to the (Un) Happy Bakery & go to TC Pastry.", "author": "Luisa T."}

This place has all the makings of a great Chinese hole in the wall dim sum place -- extremely rude servers, check; cash only, check; good food...oh wait a minute... \n\nI wanted to try out the dim sum place across the street (TC Pastry), but they were closed for two weeks for vacation. I was hunkering for some good dim sum so when I saw this place across the street, I thought that must be a sign. The place had a good amount of patrons so I dismissed the three star rating and went in. Well, I was certainly disappointed because the food was atrocious!\n\nFirst of all, their portion sizes of dim sum is at least 15% smaller than any other places that I've ordered. The shrimp dumpling had thick mushy wrapper and barely any shrimp. The beef dumplings were ok, but the level of flavor was pretty muted compared to other places. With subpar food, the eye rolling from the server really riled me. How they managed to survive in the Richmond is beyond me. I certainly won't make the mistake of patronizing this place again!", "author": "Alice W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-27", "description": "First of all,\n\nEveryone. Be real. You don't come here to get Michelin Star Dim Sum and Chinese Cuisine. You come here because you want to grab something quick to eat or take it to go for lunch. That being said, the fairest comparison for happy bakery is to compare it to all the other Chinese Dimsum x-press and Chinese Deli food places in the area (although this places doesn't serve BBQ items). So here's the lowdown\n\nDim Sum\nMost items are $1.80 per order. You have your Har Gow, Siu Mai, Guo Tie, Shark Fin Gow, Lo Mai Gai, etc. Then you have your sweeter items like cherng fun and dan tat. Next is baked items like Nai Wong Bao, Cha Siu Bao, Po Lo Bao. I would say everything here is generally good but it really depends on what time you go and whether you come at the right now when a fresh batch comes out of the kitchen. The best time to go would be in the morning when its the freshest. I will have to say, in my dim sum eating experience( having been to over 20 yum cha places and dim sum restaurants in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Irvine, & San Diego) this place HANDS DOWN has the BEST Har Gow. The dumpling itself is chewy and the shrimp filling is juicy and plump.\n\nChinese Takeout\nThis place offers 2 items with white rice for $4.50(additional items extra). I don't know about you but this is a great deal for takeout lunch. What this place is good at is presentation. Yes its cheap food but the counter itself is well maintained and there are no scraps of food all over the place. They also clean the area well so you feel like your eating relatively clean food. I recommend getting the Pai Gwut, Chicken with Mushroom, Fried Tofu, and Curry.\n\nThis place is pretty good compared to others so its worth a shot. I've been coming here for 7 years and bad experiences seem few and far between.", "author": "James K."}

There are two doors, one door is for noodle and chinese food and the other door is for dim sum. Order and pay separately. \n\nThey advertise white rice with two chinese items for $4.61. So exactly $5 after taxes. But I think the unadvertised deal is better, which is fried rice or noodle with one chinese item also for $5 (after taxes). I really really really like the fried thin rice noodle with shreds of meat here. It is not oily and very tasty. My second favorite is the soy sauce thick rice noodle crepe. But this is a little more greasy. And I think any chinese side item you pick is pretty good.

The food is usually really good, and cheap (dim sum prices are 3 pieces for $1.80, pork buns for about $1.00, and a can of soda for $1.00).\n\nTypically, the restaurant would be a 4 out of 5.  The place is a bit messy, but it is a hole in the wall dim sum bakery off of a busy street.  What it lacks in appearance, it makes up for in quality and cost.  \n\nToday, it was just awful.  Me and a few friends went there to eat.\n\nService: I asked the person behind the counter for some steamed pork buns, right away she says they are out.   I am okay with this, as they are a popular item.  However, after I sat down to eat, my friend who ordered right after me sat down and pulled out a steamed pork bun.  Why does the person tell me one thing, when there obviously are steamed pork buns available?\n\nFood: The food here is typically pretty good, especially for how little you pay.   I never go away thinking that I am getting what I am paying for.  However, today, I experienced the worst dim sum eating experience I have ever encountered.  I order sui mai, ha gow, and dumplings.   The sui mai was good per usual - no complaints there.  The ha gow and the pork dumplings were a different story.   These two items are usually pretty good here: you can see the pink shrimps in the middle of the ha gow, and the dumplings savory morsels to eat.   The ha gow I had today were a brownish pink color and did not have a very fresh taste or look.   The pork inside the dumping had the texture of oatmeal, and was the worst dumpling I have ever had.  Not a single bite of the ha gow or dumplings would be anything I would call savory, delicious, or something I would go back to the bakery for.\n\nAgain, usually they are pretty good.

So i took the bait woke up early at 630 because thats when they open and went.\n\nNo line. No wait. No Problem. I believe the bakery is broken up into two counters one for the DIM SUM which I came for, and two for the noodles, tempura, and rice stuff.\n\nEverything straight up on the dim sum side is 3 for 1.80 , except for the siopow. (steam or baked) is like a buck or two. still bomb tho and \"HELLA, HECKA,\" cheap (sorry i was breaking into my bay personality) anyway. A must go for cheap eats, quick eats...especially if you're chillin in the outer sunset area of SF!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe cheapest delicious dim sum you can find in sf.", "author": "Mike P."}

I'd give it a full 5 stars if they offered HongKong tea like TC across the street, but they don't.

Second thing I noticed was the stench from a guy who works behind the scenes (making the food?). If he reeked that much imagine what could go in the food. How can they let someone like that be anywhere near food? Third thing I don't like is how greasy and msg loaded the lunch items are. After I finished eating I felt nauseous and my mouth was so dry.

You can order dim sum, buns and other hot food from steam tables.  \n\nWe ordered some siu mai, shrimp dumplings, BBQ Pork Buns for dim sum and Sweet and Sour Pork with fried rice and chow mien from the steam tables.  \n\nThe siu mai were OK, and full of meat and not very salty.  Just like anything else, they were made better with chili sauce.  Most siu mai has shrimp in it, but these don't, so that makes them better in my opinion.  The shrimp dumplings were scarfed before I could get anything.  That must tell you something.  I didn't care much for the pork buns, while filled with meat, they were too sweet.  The sweet and sour pork with fried rice and chow mien were also just OK.  Prices are not bad at about $1.50 for 3 pieces of dim sum and less than $1 each for the buns.\n\nNot too much in the way of seating but most people get their food to go.

I've never tried the deli side, so my review applies to the dim sum side only.\n\nLike most other dim sum shops in the Sunset & Richmond districts, dumplings are 3 for $1.50.  The selection at Happy Bakery isn't as wide as Mongkok's, TC Pastry or Jook Time - they have about as much as Gourmet Dim Sum.  The menu is in English and there are pictures for some items, so it shouldn't be too hard to get what you want.  \n\nThey have Chinese rice tamales, egg custard tarts, steamed cake, baked buns (90 cents each), steamed buns, wife cake, mini moon cakes, rice rolls, etc. - your standard takeout dim sum items.  \n\nI've been here a couple of times.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by what I had today:\n* Porridge w/ pork & preserved egg (rice soup on the menu) - nice and thick, surprisingly good flavor though low on preserved egg & pork.  No scallions or ginger used.  The chunks of pork are too big though.  Pork needs improvement (marinate it? Use a different cut?). Good Luck Dim Sum still has the best dim sum takeout porridge but Happy Bakery isn't too shabby.\n* Har gow - larger than average with 3 or 4 medium shrimp per dumpling.  More shrimp than you usually get, nice flavor, not too salty.  Skin is thicker than usual.  Served warm.  Quite good!\n* Steamed chicken bun - I like how they use big chunks of chicken, scallions and shitake mushrooms.  Could use more mushrooms but the flavor was quite good.  Decent amount of filling.  \n\nThose three items totaled $4.70.  Cash only.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Good amount of meat filling, and not skimpy.\n\n5) Great Chinese deli-style fried chicken drumsticks.. YUM.. \n\n6) The sticky rice burrito things wrapped in lotus leaves are very good here too.  Most other places OD on the rice, and barely have any meat filling, but Happy Bakery doesn't neglect putting in a decent amount of pork, egg and chinese sausage inside.

Because I really, really miss Golden City, the previous restaurant in this location.  It really was incredible, was a family favorite for over 25 years, a place where we'd enjoyed many memorable meals and celebrated events large and small.  Their signature dish was Princess Prawns, and we are still mourning them -- still have not found anything that even comes close.  I wish I knew where the cooks went when they unceremoniously and without any warning closed Golden City....\n\nBut, back to Happy Bakery . . . I know it's cheap, but frankly, I'd rather pay a bit more for better quality.  I hate biting into a pork bow and coming out with a mouthful of pork fat!  I despise biting into shrimp har gow and having to pick the shrimp shell from my teeth.  I really get angry when I get an elbow or knuckle in a bite of chicken sui mai.  \n\nI'd always suspected that there is one centralized factory in the back alleys of Chinatown (or maybe of the Sunset) where every piece of dim sum is made and then shipped out to all the restaurants in town, but Happy Bakery disproves my theory... they must be either making it there, or getting the \"seconds\" at cut throat prices.   \n\nPlus, given the intense parking situation on that stretch of Irving, I'd say it definitely is not worth a special visit.  Maybe if you're already there, have only $3.25 in your pocket, and are absolutely starving to death it would be fun.  But do you want to risk the aftermath?

To fit all of the swiney goodness contained inside.\n\nThe syrup on the inside was sparse, making the bun a tiny bit dryer BUT the red char siu pork shone through the insides of this bun like giant rubies in a doughy crown.  I have never seen such large chunks of swine in a pork bun.  And there was no gristle or anything, just perfectly tender bits of artificially dyed piggy in a modest syrup.  Not only was the meat perfect, but the char siu flavor was so strong that I couldn't taste any \"normal\" (not char siu) food for a couple hours after.  Just as it should be.\n\nI would have given this place a \"5\" for such a porky performance, but I had to deduct a star for the weird texture.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-11-07", "description": "I'm eating the food from Happy Bakery as I write this review, so this is as accurate as a TV review. I work just around the corner, so this is the easiest place for me to pick something quick to eat. I can't say their establishment is clean, but it's passable. So far, no problems with the food. The service there is nothing more than your usual cynical Chinese folk that shun every customer that can't make up their mind, but don't expect too much from Chinese bakeries, they are mostly like this (unless you make friends with them). \n\nI just finished my Har Kow (Shrimp Dumpling) and Siu Mai (I don't know what this is in English) and I'll say this: Best bought fresh and hot. It's a little cold for the Siu Mai even when they were taken out of their warm steamers. Definitely had better. Next is my Lo Mai Kai (Sticky Rice with Chicken wrapped in a leaf). Unwrapping it might prove challenging as the leaf is easily two feet long, so give some room. As for taste, it's pretty decent. I say it's the right amount of flavor, so it's not too bad. They could be a little more generous with the fillings, but understand that Chinese culture believes in more rice, less everything else. \n\nNow to my usual fare. Every once in a while, when I'm hungry and need something quick, I would run down here to get their Char Siew Bau. I've tried both the steamed and baked and I honestly feel that the steam is more appealing. Couple reasons why: 1) the fillings compliment the bau very well, 2) the BBQ pork inside is usually meaty with the occasional fat, 3) it feels easier to eat, and 4) I like them steamed. This is probably the reason why I like to keep a high-enough rating, but whether you like it or not, I believe that the Char Siew Bau is one of the best things to get here. \n\nNow for the other crazy things that I tried here. The Cheong Fun (Steamed Rice Rolls) is one of my favorite Dim Sum dishes and I happened to feel like it at one point during lunchtime. I tried some here and I don't think I'll try it even again. Despite it's thickness, the Cheong Fun still breaks apart easily. I had Cheong Fun from other Chinese restaurants and those could maintain their integrity from the plate to my mouth. This one just doesn't want to hold itself together. On top of that, I ordered the Shrimp Cheong Fun, but hey! Where's the Shrimp! I found about 4 pieces whereas they could easily fit twice as much. Saving money on shrimp? I don't know, but I'm going to have my Cheong Fun elsewhere. \n\nI've tried the Po Lo Bau (Pineapple Bun, but there's nothing pineapple about it; it's just a name). Not bad. Decent size with decent portion of its cookie top. A little messy once it crumbles, but it's good either way. \n\nNow last thing to mention, I promise, is the counter just opposite of the Dim Sum, which sells regular Chinese fare (Rice, noodles, meat and vegetables). I've tried various combinations of their dishes and carbs and it's ok, if not mediocre. Point to note is that I felt like I'm gambling with my food as in one occasion, I found a strand of hair deep fried into my Sweet and Sour Chicken. And again, I gambled and risked my health and money by ordering it again in another time, but I found nothing. So order at your own peril! \n\nQuality of the food can be sporadic, but it's fair decent with the price for how much the food can fill you up. I'm just finishing the last bite of my Lo Mai Kai and it's definitely filling for me. Now whether you trust my taste buds is entirely your choice, which is the beauty of it, but if it wasn't for that Char Siew Bau, this place won't receive much of my attention.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

I like it cus its right by my 2 banks, HSBC on the corner and Wells Fargo diagonally across the intersection...so I park in this area a lot.  When Im done with banking/ATM stuff, I sometimes head over here for my lunch/dinner.\n\nI liked how they now sell the green onion pancakes on the dimsum side.  That banana leaf covered rice and meat meal-on-the-go thing they sell is also my fav.\n\nOn the 2 item combo side, I like how they usually change it up on different days (some things they always have, like fried chicken).  I admit, sometimes its a bit too oily but for the price, I can't complain.\n\nI remember they used to sell the combos for $3.25 a few years ago, then $3.50, then $3.75.  I think its at $4.50 after tax now.\n\nMy regular place for Chinese takeout.", "author": "Gilbert C."}

They have a pretty good variety of choices but the food can be inconsistent.  Tried the fried chicken wings which was decent as well as the drumsticks but not spectacular.  The chow fun was pretty good today but the thicker chow mein was bland.  Their black bean sauce pork spareribs is usually good. They make tofu dishes, bitter melon dishes and sweet & sour pork, which is usually a staple.  I feel sorry for the seniors on fixed income who come here, it's not that cheap for them. The black bean pork was over $4/lb and you're paying mostly for bones and ligaments.

I've bought their food for family functions, picnics, and major school events (potlucks, PTA meetings, fundraisers, class parties, volunteer school events).  \n\nI'm Chinese and my family has traveled to Asia repeatedly and the food is fine. It's authentic and not plastered with food coloring and tons of lumpy corn starch gravy. Every function that I bought the food for has been praised by other students, teachers, staff, and parents alike.  It's reasonable and I am always asked where I got it from. \n\nThey love the Chow Mein skinny noodles, chow fun, fired rice noodles, and the fried chicken, broccoli beef, soy sauce chicken wings, etc...!  They all ask where I got it from.  I've been getting it for years here.  My school has many clean up days at school and they will come and volunteer just for the food alone!\n\nSure, the service is not always with a smile  It's cultural but don't take it personally.   The variety, quality, speed and the price is worth it.  Their native language is not English so their service is limited and similar to what it would be like in another country.  It is what it is; cheap price, fast food.  \n\nI always order in advance and pick it up and go.  Usually I order stuff 10-15lbs at a time.  Dim sum is fine.  I love the vegetarian stuff, foo jook, eggplant, and jai.  Breakfast stuff...Chinese rice porridge, donut, sticky rice/ tamales wrapped in leaves all good.
