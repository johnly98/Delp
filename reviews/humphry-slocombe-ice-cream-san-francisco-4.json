Anywho, back to the ice cream shop, it is open pretty later compared to many of the other shops that were closed or closing down when I arrived (8ish). The line was pretty short, which was awesome, easy in and out for me. They clearly list the flavors on a board ahead of time so no need to hover over the ice cream fridge trying to figure out which flavor to choose. As with any ice cream shop, tasting is a must beforehand and I performed my due diligence in tasting what I could. They are pretty generous when it comes to the scoop sizes, but be prepared for higher prices than your average ice cream shop, I believe I paid around six and half dollars for two scoops. Fast forward to the final choices, I ended up going with their secret breakfast, which was a blend of cork flakes and bourbon with a second scoop of blue vietnamese coffee. It was an absolute perfect blend for a post dinner sweet, and would easily re visit them if I was in the area again to explore some other flavors (Although that secret breakfast was terrific!).", "author": "Ryan A."}

In a city that is rich with high quality ice cream places, HS is tops in my mind.  Their flavors are delicious and unique but what I like most about their ice cream is the texture.  I like my ice creams to be very dense and rich that requires some chew.  Not a fan of lighter ice creams that seem like they've been left out of the freezer to warm for a little bit.\n\nMy favorite flavors are there vanilla (French and/or Tahitian), brown butter and black sesame.  One of my main measuring sticks for an ice cream place is how good their vanilla is.  If done right, vanilla is not some plain Jane flavor that needs topping.  If done right, vanilla is a very sophisticated and complex flavor.  Humphrey Slocombe nails their vanilla.\n\nService is always friendly.  Pro tip:  If you don't like to wait in line, go during the week days and in the middle or early part of the day (especially at the ferry building).  Their Mission shop is also a nice place to visit.", "author": "Oliver S."}

Seriously, just buy a pint from the grocery store if you want to do that.  Instead, to truly experience the ice cream shop magic, you need to try the sundaes and other concoctions.  Mr. Slocombe did not disappoint on that front!\n\nMake It Gay Sundae: Perfect for Pride Season!  A base of Harvey Milk (of course), which is pretty neutral except for the nice chewy soaked graham crackers.  Then pink fluff!  I love fluff in general, but pink fluff makes it seem so festive.  Then froot loops, which are both colorful and playful at the same time.\n\nSecret Breakfast Sundae: The bourbon caramel is pretty cool.  It actually tastes like bourbon and it looks pretty awesome being a translucent gold hue.  The secret breakfast ice cream is one of my favorites since cornflakes + (frozen) milk + bourbon is just awesome.  I also liked the corn flakes topping because it was a nice contrast to the softer corn flakes mixed into the ice cream.\n\nFudge Brownie Deee-lite: This feels like it's out of the Ghirardelli playbook.  Gooey brownie, hot fudge and a scoop of the ice cream of your choice (I chose Vietnamese Coffee).  Probably the heaviest of the sundaes I've tried, even though it's just one scoop of ice cream.

This ice cream was in the fairy building in San Francisco and really wowed my family with their flavors. Another family member of mine and I got the strawberry basil ice cream and after eating a lot that day I was happy with how refreshing the ice cream was. It was creamy, soft and had a hint of lemon. Fear not, it's not to noticeable if your not a fan of lemon. When I tasted this it just had the flavor of lemon it did not say that it did though. My other family member got the Blue Bottle Ice Cream. They said it was super creamy and the coffee taste really came thorough with her ice cream. No wonder there was a blue bottle ice cream that day, Blue Bottle was just across from their.

I tried the strawberry captain crunch and I wasn't a fan; the captain crunch cereal was soggy and the strawberry flavor wasn't too pronounced.

Service was also a bit messy. \n\nMy friend and I went to the Ferry Building on a Sunday night, and I was particularly excited to try this place out. Most of the shops were closed by the time we went, but there were lines of 20+ people for both Humphry Slocombe and Gott's Roadside next door. The line moved at a normal rate; I waited for a total of 15-20 minutes.\n\nService was alright. There were only two servers working, and one (curly-haired girl) seemed to be busy scooping while the other (redhead girl) was taking orders. I didn't notice there was a second cash register to the left of the counter that the curly-haired girl was in charge of. I assumed Curly Hair was standing there to handle the order for the couple in front of me once the redhead, who was working the cash register to the right, told her what to scoop.\n\nI was patiently waiting for the couple to finish ordering before asking for samples and ordering myself, until two women behind me swooped in and cut me... They started asking for samples from Curly Hair, who proceeded to assist them. I know it's not really Curly Hair's fault that the women were rude and clearly don't understand the concept of a line, but she should've communicated better with some eye contact or at least an \"I can help who's next!\" Besides that, the redhead was friendly and helpful.\n\nMost of their flavors for the day did not appeal to me. They were definitely unique, but the selection seemed a bit limited. I noticed a chocolate and cereal theme going on: Secret Breakfast, Malted Milk Chocolate, Choco Taco, Oatlandish, Cap'n Crunch & Berry, etc. I don't have anything against chocolate or cereal desserts; I just prefer ice cream flavors such as green tea, black sesame, honey lavender, pistachio, and the like.\n\nStill, I heard great things about their Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee flavor and was determined to try it. I ordered a single size in a cone, which came out to $4.50. I was pleasantly surprised that the cone did not cost extra, as most specialty ice cream shops charge at least $1 for a cone!\n\nI'm a fan of Blue Bottle Coffee, so naturally the Vietnamese Coffee flavor did not disappoint! I don't normally like coffee-flavored ice cream (at least from the grocery store) or even Vietnamese coffee (despite being Vietnamese myself). However, Humphry Slocombe's take on making this super sweet drink into ice cream was borderline genius. The ice cream was at the perfect amount of sweetness - not too bitter like ice cream from the grocery store, and not too overwhelming and migraine-inducing like coffee from Lee's Sandwiches. Would definitely reorder!\n\nBecause of their Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee flavor alone, Humphry Slocombe sits at a solid 4 stars (rather than 3 stars due to the service and limited selection) for me. I can see why it's rated as one of the Top 5 Ice Creams in America by the Food Network!", "author": "Megan L."}

The staff was great as well as they provided all the samples I wanted - Humphry is the place for you indecisive people like me. \n\nI went 2 split scoops and got the famous secret breakfast, the Vietnamese coffee, the peanut butter, and the chocolate. The peanut butter and the secret breakfast were a tad bit sweeter than the coffee and the chocolate, so all flavors balanced each other out. Of the four, I would say the secret breakfast was my favorite - it reminded me of Milk's cereal soft serve, except unlike Milk, this wasn't cloyingly super sweet. The peanut butter was too sweet for my liking, but definitely packs the peanut butter taste, so perfect for you peanut butter lovers. \n\nDefinitely a stop, especially since it's splat in the tourist spot.", "author": "Wendy L."}

This is my suggestion to all first timers and visitors I bring to the city and never disappoints. \n\nSome other flavors that I rotate in my second scoop are the Tahitian vanilla, malted chocolate, and Vietnamese Blue Bottle coffee. \n\nThis set you back about $6 which tends to be on the pricier side of ice cream, but you really do get what you pay for. \n\nFor those looking for a classic pairing, just look right across the way at Blue Bottle.

I had some time to kill and decided to refresh myself with some ice cream. I went during lunch time and there was barely a line. Score!\n\nI always try to look at the menu prior to going to places so I can hem and haw over options in peace, rather than feeling that the server and the people in line are going nuts. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to review their flavors. So I read some reviews in preparation and there were a lot on the secret breakfast. \n\nI sampled their tricolored matcha, raspberry and some other flavor sorbet, as well as their parallel lines flavor. The tricolored sorbet looked beautiful and it tasted like a burst of multiple tropical flavors. The parallel lines was composed of brown sugar and brownie bits. I didn't get any brownie bits and this was very sweet.\nSince a long line had started forming behind me, I winged it and went with a scoop of the secret breakfast.\n\nThe secret breakfast has a very mild boozy flavor and is fabulous! Bourbon is combined with generous cornflake clusters that are embedded in the scoop. Alcohol based ice creams do tend to be on the sweet side. I wish it was a tad less sweet as they also have an additional sweet element, cornflake clusters. The cornflake's flavor wasn't able to come through more prominently.\n\nI'm glad that Slocombe did not use an over powering amount of alcohol in the secret breakfast. Their scoops are on the more expensive side and are pretty sweet. But if you have a sweet tooth, this is a good option for a treat now and then.

Me and a party of 3 came in at around 7pm on a Friday and did not have to wait at all to order. \n\nAt Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream, there are very many different, and most importantly unique flavors. There are flavors such as Harvey Milk with Honey Graham, Maple Walnut, Coconut Sherbet, etc.\n\nI got the Secret Breakfast (Bourbon with Corn Flakes) with a waffle cone (a MUST for ice cream), which is one of their more popular flavors.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the Secret Breakfast. On some bites, I could not taste the bourbon at all and only had vanilla, but some bites had a very apparent bourbon taste. I thought the corn flakes were a good addition to the ice cream itself. Secret Breakfast to me is an awesome idea which combines adult themes (bourbon) but still goes back to the whimsical roots of ice cream being fun (corn flakes). My scoop this time around might not have had the best ratio, but I think the idea is great.\n\nWhile the flavor of the ice cream was okay, the service that I received was not great. I felt that because I took a little more time than the rest of my party to try and decide on my flavors that the person who served me did not treat me well.\n\nI would come here again just to see what crazy new flavors they have, but actually getting some ice cream and going through their service is something I would have to think about.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

While in line, contemplating the flavor choices, I gleaned that the most popular seemed to be Secret Breakfast: a curious combo of bourbon and cornflakes. Normally I don't like alcohol-esque flavors (even in desserts, especially in desserts), but I figured if it was the fan favorite, I ought to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The caramel flavors mixed amazingly well, and the clumps of cornflakes gave the ice cream a texture that really rounded out the experience. I honestly can't even remember the other flavor I tried, because as soon as I tasted Secret Breakfast, my single scoop was decided. \n\nA single scoop of Secret Breakfast in a cone was ~$5, so it was pretty expensive as far as ice cream goes, but it was definitely worth it. \n\nI'll probably be sticking to my gelaterias, but I highly recommend that if you're an ice cream fan, to brave the long lines and give this place a go.", "author": "Waverly R."}

The almond slices in the JAF were pasty and had a weird, stale texture. My mom ended up throwing hers away after a few bites. The Secret Breakfast tasted only like Bourbon and I didn't taste much cereal flavor but I DID have a lot of soggy cereal bits which was unappetizing to say the least. Lastly, the RBCC tasted pretty good but the chocolate pieces in it tasted like cheap chocolate with a similarly bad texture to match. \n\nI'm comparing the Secret Breakfast to the cereal milk flavor at Momofuku Milkbar and at After's ice cream and it just didn't have any flavor other than Bourbon. If it had been touted as a Bourbon ice cream, I wouldn't have been as disappointed but I also wouldn't have ordered it. Maybe it's just my expectations not lining up with  reality?

If you like to try flavors, be sure to ask for samples and also get a split scoop. This place is great that they offer split scoops! I can never try enough flavors. \n4. The cone is free!!! For the least mess and most to eat, get a cup and a cone. \n\nOverall, amazing ice cream!", "author": "Jessica L."}

I got the Vietnamese Coffee and Maple Walnut; my wife, the brown butter.\n\nFirst off, the ice cream is very rich and packed with flavor. The Vietnamese Coffee ice cream was strong but not over bearing. The Maple Walnut was really smooth and silky with chunks of walnuts. Overall a real pleasure to eat.\n\nThe winner of the day was the brown butter ice cream. It literally tasted like almond rocha candy which brought back a nostalgic feeling. Rich, smooth, and sweet...everything you'd want in ice cream.\n\nLine was a little long but it goes to show how good the product it. Customer service was fast and friendly with The Bay Area feeling.

Glad this baby was at the Ferry Building when I visited because on a hot day, my friend and I made a day of it, having our own food tour and Humphry Slocombe's was sure to be last on our list for dessert. \n\nAfter waiting in the long line that fortunately, went by quickly, we were able to try all the different flavors we wanted, and will say, the flavors are verrrrry abundant.  From what I heard, Secret Breakfast was the one to try, which I did, and must confess - it was not for me.  There was just too much of different flavors going on with the bourbon, honey, cornflakes, etc... I like distinct flavors, but I wasn't sure what I should be tasting from this jumble.  However, I did find a favorite - Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee.  The flavor was outstanding, and really tasted as if you were drinking a creamy Vietnamese iced coffee, which I'm a fan of.  But to have the wonderful partnership of Blue Bottle Coffee, which is one of the best coffees in the world, just puts the cherry on the cake.  It was superb.  I also was able to do two flavors for one scoop, so chose Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple for my other flavor, which I recommend for anyone who loves peanut butter (like me!).  \n\n All in all - it's a great ice cream shop and a must if you're in the SF area.

I am a strong advocate for  anything that has ice cream in general. Ice cream is probably the one dessert I can eat at any weather,time or day. I have come to this ice cream shop around 3 times or more but every time i come here I have loved the variety of flavors and the texture of the ice cream. \n\nFor flavors: I usually get the breakfast special (which consists of a bourbon tasting ice cream, that they are really known for) with a scoop of their seasonal/ monthly different flavors. The first time I came here I ordered the breakfast special sundae which includes two scoops of the ice cream with drizzled Carmel and cornflakes. Sounds like a sugar rush but everything actually went quite well and it wasn't too over powering with so much sugary ingredients. The other times I ordered a regular cone with oolong tea and rose. Both 10/10. \n\nThe downside is that the ice cream does tend to melt rather quickly so I suggest to maybe get a cup if you are one of those slow ice cream eaters to not make a mess. Also test out the flavors and see which ones you like! They have a great unique variety of flavors that you can easily find a flavor that is right for your taste buds!

I wish someone would invent a spoon to heat your mouth after each bite to bring your tastebuds back to optimal tasting mode. This is what I think about when I don't get enough sleep. Anyway....\n\nAnother review (number four!) from the comforts of my swivel chair and footrest made from stacked piles of printer paper. For some reason, I used to have the impression that Humphrey Slocombe's blue bottle coffee (and I LOVE coffee ice cream) was super perfect. For some reason, this time around, it just doesn't taste that strongly of coffee to me, although it's still something that I'd eat. I guess it just tastes like coffee with a lot lot lot of cream.\n\nOther flavors I've tried are matcha snickerdoodle (deja vu much with my review of Craftsman and Wolves yesterday?), honey graham, strawberry tequila, secret breakfast, and sea salt chocolate. Matcha snickerdoodle tasted neither like matcha nor snickerdoodle (what is up with this very specific misnomer?), strawberry tequila was slushy and became sort of sticky after time in the freezer, secret breakfrast was alright-- the cornflakes were just kind of additional texture although I didn't OMG LOVE it.\n\nI want to like this spot though, the flavors just look so avant-garde and promising! White miso pear and persimmon lychee sorbet look so delicious...just might get some tonight.... Btw, all their flavors that are available in store at any time are on their site at humphreyslocombe.com!\n--\n\nUpdate! I ended up getting them! Unfortunately, they are just okay. The persimmon lychee sorbet isn't too sweet, which is good, but the tough skin was ground up into tiny pieces, which is suboptimal. Don't know whether the persimmon and lychee together make a good combo, since you can't make out either fruit. It's not terrible tho. White miso pear! Yup, definitely can taste the miso, though it's mostly an aftertaste. Very verrrrry slightly sweet, but definitely more miso-y. Can't really make out the pear taste, although you can tell it's there because it's refreshing and because of the texture of the ground up pear. Maybe I'm bad at picking flavors?\n\n--\n\nEdit: Been back close to a bajillion times, and I can't say that my impression has changed. Since then, I've tried out a number of their summer flavors including:\n\nCinammon tres leches: I love cinnamon ice cream and this was not an exception. Not too sweet, which was a plus.\n\nBlackberry honey: More like a honey ice cream, though the thought of blackberry was a nice touch. \n\nElote:I like savory ice creams, and corn ice cream is super reminiscent of China for me. This was interesting, but I'm not sure I could eat a whole cup of it.\n\nHere's your damn strawberry: Pretty standard strawberry.\n\nPeach and blackberry cobbler: It was aite, I didn't love it but didn't hate it.\n\nEarl grey plum sorbet: Not that sweet, which I liked. Not that memorable either though.\n\nHong Kong milk tea: They have the condensed milk flavor in this right, but the sweetness is a bit too much and masks the tea. \n\nSalted caramel cocoa nib: Eh, I got the salt and caramel part, but it didn't scream delicious to me. The nibs were a bit too large, but perhaps the point is to have something to chew on? Good chocolate flavor on the nibs.", "author": "Nicole H."}

Especially if you are first-timer. You can't taste the perfectly crunchy corn flakes with underlying Bourbon flavors with just a free sample! I always tell myself to try something new each time I go, but 9 times out of 10, I find myself with a scoop of the Secret Breakfast. Welp. Every time is as delicious as the first. \n\nBTW, one scoop in a cup seems deceivingly small - The ice cream is quite creamy and dense, so one scoop ends up being pretty filling. Especially if you've been making your food journey through the Ferry Building! \n\nOther personal faves (limited) are the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and the Harvey Milk & Honey Graham. If ya tryna get that IG pic, get the honey drizzle for an extra $1. Take that ice cream cone out the backdoor of the Ferry Building and take your money shot with the backdrop of the Bay Bridge.

Just very pleasant to taste, authentic, and quite the treat to devour. Salted Caramel Coca Nib is also quite yummy & worth looking into. Overall, a most noteworthy place to come get some ice cream. Flavors also tend to rotate from month to month although they do have some flavors that are pretty much there all year.

After eating a late lunch at Hog Island Oyster across the way, we knew we had to come here. The line is a little intimidating, but I think it goes by fairly quickly. The guy who helped us was so nice even when I asked to try four flavors. I tried the Secret Breakfast, Harvey Milk + Honey Graham, Cap'n Crunch Berry, and Elote. We got a double scoop of Secret Breakfast and Harvey Milk + Honey Graham.  The Secret Breakfast has chunks of cornflakes. Be careful! We encountered a chunk that was bigger than a gumball and impossible to chew. It was still a great flavor. It's sweet but salty. The Milk + Honey Graham was a lighter flavor but still very good. I didn't like the Cap'n Crunch Berry a much... mostly because the piece of cereal that was on the sample was very stale. The elote wasn't what I expected it to me. I love corn and thought I would like this flavor, but it had a spicy taste that I wasn't fond of.\n\nI was watching the guy scoop our ice cream... and... let me tell you... he gave the most generous scoops.

You can easily pair it with any of the other flavors without compromising either ice creams flavors. It's rich and creamy and that's what I look for in vanilla ice cream, another thing, you can truly taste the bean... I want to say I can tell they aren't using extract and they're using high-quality beans, but I don't have proof other than my senses. Speaking of senses, the smell is pretty strong & amazing. \n\n-Secret Breakfast: Want a guilt-free breakfast, this one's for you. HS ever so popular and signature flavor. I do like it, it's extremely robust and noteworthy. I've never really seen anything like it, but it's just a little too bourbon-y for me. Not a fan of bourbon and this flavor has a healthy dose of bourbon flavor. I do enjoy the texture a lot and it's worth trying, just not for me.\n\nService: Cordial and patient, but don't take forever. It's good to scan the menu before getting into the long line.\n\nPrice: Considering location, flavor and quality - the price is very reasonable. Their flavors and extremely unique and the quality is premier. Definitely worth trying & coming back and trying some more.\n\nAmbiance: Obviously not as large as the original location, but even the Harrison location doesn't provide a lot of seating. I'm a firm believer that ice cream should be portable & consumed on the go. Clean and vibrant atmosphere overall.\n\nOverall: Admirable ice cream flavors!

I think the Secret Breakfast is the flagship flavor, if there can be just one, an utterly irresistible mix of whiskey and cornflakes, a perfect combination, at least with a whole lot of milk fat.

That's the only fitting word to describe the Peach Melba flavor.\n\nHumphry Slocombe has a small variety of unique an creative flavors that periodically changes.  While the quality of the ice cream is good overall, it's the Peach Melba that sets itself apart and is truly on another level above the other offerings.  The Peach Melba contains peach and apricot purees, combined with a raspberry jam and a neutral ice cream base.  Using seasonal stone fruits during summer is already a plus, but the concentrated flavor of purees intensifies those sweet flavors.  The raspberry jam adds a tartness that complements the sweet peach and apricot sensations and makes your mouth begging for more.  All of this is held together with a soft, creamy base, which is perfect for several reasons.  First of all, it doesn't complicate the product by adding in another flavor.  Secondly, the soft texture allows you to taste the ice cream immediately as opposed to the initial burning sensation of hard ice cream on your tongue.

In comparison to Bi-Rite, I prefer Humphry Slocombe because the flavors aren't too sweet and the consistency was better.\n\nThe line snakes around quite a bit, but moves fairly quickly and is definitely worth the wait.

They offer unique flavors that kind of make you question the taste, but when you actually try it, you're sold on it.\n\nSuch a unique ice cream flavor includes the popular Secret Breakfast ice cream, which is bourbon infused vanilla ice cream with cornflakes.

The cornflakes help out with the taste as well.\n\nI also had the Malted Milk Chocolate ice cream with the Secret Breakfast.

It's not like froyo, where it doesn't quite hit the ice cream mark, and it's not super creamy like usual ice cream, where lactose-intolerant folks will feel the effects after eating it. It's airy. It's fluffy. I don't think I've had ice cream like this before!\n\n+ SECRET BREAKFAST: I had this at 10 AM, so I really did have this as my breakfast. After having other famous milk flavors, like Momofuku in NY and Afters in Fountain Valley, I think this ice cream wins. I am a huge fan of cereal, but usually the milk/cereal flavors tend to be a little boring. This flavor has a kick of bourbon that you can actually taste and the cornflakes provide a great texture to the scoop! \n\n+ HARVEY MILK & HONEY GRAHAM: I am a huge fan of honey ice cream because it provides a hint of sweetness without being overpowering. Instead of just honey graham crackers, I could really taste honey flavors on top of the sweetened milk. \n\nI wasn't too adventurous with my flavors, but they had flavors that ranged from Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee to Brown Sugar Fennel and Peanut Butter Curry!!!", "author": "Sophie P."}

If nothing else, make use of the time to decide what one or two flavors you're going to go with, because let me assure you that nothing will haunt you like sampling a friend's selection and realizing that it's somehow even better than yours. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nIce cream is, for whatever reason, expensive these days, and my order of a single scoop of Secret Breakfast in a cup was no different ringing up at $4.00. That's steep, but the price point was put into perspective when a scoop of Cookies and Cream and nearby Over the Moon ran me a dollar more on account of it being in between two oreo cookies. It's close, but Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nHumphry Slocombe keeps you guessing with a constantly changing flavor line up that's not always in line with what you'd typically find elsewhere. Standard Chocolate? Cookies n Cream? Peanut Butter anyone? No dice. Initially this had me a bit worried given that I'm typically one for the classics, but my fears were alleviated when one of the friendly servers insisted that I get Secret Breakfast. Bourbon flavored ice cream with corn flakes in the mix? I'll be honest - that sounded awful, but I trusted the system and went for it. \n\nGoodness me was I glad I did. Again, the combination truly sounded dreadful, but it couldn't have been better. No, it didn't taste like bourbon or cornflakes, but instead was a sweet but crunchy combination that I could have eaten far more of. From what I've heard, the other rotating and steady flavors are in the same ballpark, and that can only mean that both stars are warranted here. Dual Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nHumphry Slocombe is a fantastic option for ice cream in San Francisco, but given that it's one of many fantastic options, I can't go the full five stars here.

How they can make such a creamy dessert that you can devour in hefty portions without feeling sick is beyond me. \n\nThey have a good selection of traditional and experimental flavors. Perhaps the most popular is the not-so-secret-anymore Secret Breakfast. I also appreciate the character in their ice cream flavor names (looking forward to ordering the Here's Your Damn Strawberry Ice Cream someday). I sampled the Fluttermutter and I almost always get something different from my sample, but the creamy PB ice cream was as good as ice cream and there was no denying I was addicted and wanted moar P: \n\nOther notes:\n- Although they don't offer cones, the ginormous scoops definitely make up for it. Prices are similar to most craft creameries.\n- Line can get long but it moves quickly. Definitely beats the Blue Bottle line right across which is as long and slow as airport security.\n- Lots of interesting ice-cream-related paraphernalia on the side shelf.\n\nWe shared a double scoop of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Iced Coffee and the Fluttermutter for $6.

I wanted the flavors to be a little more pronounced and the texture was alright but nothing special either. In terms of flavor selection, again, it was alright but I personally like things to be just a little more interesting or have more options (they do have way more interesting flavors listed on their website though- the chocolate smoked salt sounds like something I would really love). \n\nIt was a pretty busy Sunday when I came here and there was just one person working so the line got fairly long quickly since she had to give out samples, scoop ice cream, and work the register. I tried a couple of different flavors but got the Secret Breakfast since it is their most popular- bourbon ice cream and corn flakes. I would have liked more bourbon flavor as well as more crunch from the cornflakes. I think the main thing was that as one of San Francisco's well known ice cream makers, I had much higher expectations for Humphry Slocombe and was thus a tad disappointed.", "author": "Seema U."}

Yes, you can order vanilla, but you can also experience some unique and amazing flavors that will have people lining up for.\n\nMy Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n\nAtmosphere - I love the Ferry Building.  During my last visit I walked straight into the end of the line for Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream.  It was long, so I decided to move on.  But as I walked by, I caught a glimpse of the menu and knew I had to line up.  It's not absurd when you're in line to dozens of like-minded ice cream fans.  It's in the heart of the Ferry Building and this is where artists and food collide.  1 Star.\n\nService - To my surprise, the line moves fast.  They are fast, even when the gal in front of you wants to taste every flavor.  They have a limited selection, but also enough to keep you coming back.  Our total wait time was less than 10 minutes, and this included taste testing.  1 Star. \n\nFood - It's great, but it's expensive.  The secret breakfast was recommended and was great.  It was a bourbon (light caramel to me) flavor with corn flakes.  The corn flakes gave it an extra kick of texture that I thought was fantastic.  The Vietnamese coffee tasted exactly like one (sweetened condensed milk with espresso) and well worth the short wait.  While the ice cream was great, I still prefer Bi-Rite creamery.  Still - I wouldn't mind another secret breakfast scoop or two.  Or three.  1 Star.\n\nWill I Return? - Yes.  Any trip to San Francisco will mean I will visit the Ferry Building.  This also means I'll be lining up for another round at Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream.  After all, Secret Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  1 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five-star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.", "author": "Trinh T."}

Humphry's is definitely one of those places!\n\nWe taste tested a lot of the flavors that they had, and they definitely are a place that is revolutionizing ice cream flavors. The two most interesting flavors that I taste tested was mint pepper, which was savory and really interesting, and wine & cheese...I didn't like that one, but props to them for making such a daring flavor.\n\nI ended up going with Kumquat Poppy Seed, which had the rind of kumquats in there! The ice cream was very light and smooth. It didn't make my stomach hurt, which sometimes ice cream can do that. The poppy seeds added great texture too.

Jalape\u00f1o and cornbread flavor were there though.\n- Toast & Jam: same texture as Jalape\u00f1o Cornbread. ugh. Sample wasn't enough to make a definitive opinion on flavor.\n- Nectarine Plum Yogurt: bright, summer flavor, but I didn't want a whole scoop of it that day\n\nI really wanted all of those flavors (and their texture) to blow me out of the water. The granular ones didn't in their samples, but I thought I would give the Jalape\u00f1o Cornbread a try in a full scoop.

I think I'd like it better if the cornbread were either cut into whole chunks like the size of cookie dough gobs rather than what seemed like broken up pieces that were over mixed/folded in the ice cream, transforming the majority of the cornbread into crumbs.\n\nAppreciate the creativity, but overall I wasn't sold.\n\nPS only one flavor per scoop.

Heading to San Francisco this past weekend I had heard several times from our Hartford CM  Emily C that every time she was in the city, she headed to Humphyry Slocombe Ice Cream and that if I was there I HAD to get a flavor called Secret Breakfast.  Oh and by the way, she said, it's made with bourbon and corn flakes.  \n\nSay What?????  Now I like \"things\" in my ice cream but cornflakes AND bourbon.\n\nHowever, being the adventurous Yelper that I am - I figured I could try anything once and if I did not like it I would get another flavor to \"mask\" the flavor.  \n\nPro Tip #1- if you are there first thing in the morning and they are open - regardless of the time - stand in line.  I made the mistake of waiting until \"ice cream time\" (about 3pm) and the line was plenty long.  No worries - I was able to pursue the Flavor of the day (see picture) and read some other reviews which leads me to Pro Tip #2 - the staff lets you try samples - Score.  \n\nSo after a bit of a wait (not too long though, those employees are lightening fast!) - I was able to sample the Candy Capp, Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple and Matchata.  All were good but I passed on the PB as it was something I could get any where and Matchata as it was Meh.  I also tasted the Candy Capp and told the employee it tasted like Butter Pecan - however this was not the case - it is actually a mushroom (What????) that they steep and use to flavor the ice cream.\n\nSo I ended up with two scoops - this Secret Breakfast (I was already going to get it so why try it) and Candy Capp.  No toppings or flavors for this girl - I needed to try it in it's purest forms.\n\nTaking my cup outside I dug in and OMG - I know this is used a lot but that is what I felt.  The ice cream was not too sweet but creamy and luscious.  And that cornflake/bourbon combination - Game Changer.  I could definitely taste the bourbon and the crunch of the crushed cornflakes made this flavor a winner.  \n\nSo glad I was the adventurous Yelper or I would have missed out on trying some unique and very flavorful ice cream.

The line can be long or short, it's all just luck to be honest. I've been here at random times of random weekdays/weekends and I haven't noticed a consistent trend yet. Today I came on a Friday and the line was basically empty the whole day.\n\nOn my first trip here I of course had to give their famous Secret Breakfast a try. It basically tastes like corn flake cereal/milk with bourbon and I gotta say the two flavors work together damn well. It's not my favorite flavor ever but I'd definitely recommend sampling it. I've also really enjoyed the Szechuan strawberry. It has a very strong fresh strawberry flavor and the slightest bit of spice leaves you with the classic tingling lips feeling. I also love the Jasmine Lychee flavor. The lychee is very subtle but pairs very well with the Jasmine. I also loved their Spring Ale flavor though a full scoop of it was a bit heavy. I believe the various beer flavors are mainly available during SF Beer Week.\n\nI also gave the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Ice Coffee another try today and it was more fragrant than my previous trips. I still wouldn't opt for it considering there's so many other options but if you're looking for a safe choice, this one's for you.\n\nThe only ones I wouldn't personally go back for are the Peanut Butter Curry or the Brown Butter. I'm not saying they're not good. They're both decent. While the curry one is interesting and the combo works, it's just a bit too much for me as a full scoop.

At some of the places I've been to in the Bay Area (looking at you Ici's), it seems like the ice cream makers are trying to imitate the chewing gum from Willy Wonka that was a roast beef dinner with tomato soup and blueberry pie for dessert. In my opinion, all of those places come up short with their convoluted flavor combinations, and I just end up feeling blue (or should I say violet). That being said, Humphry Slocombe has managed create innovative flavors of ice cream without going completely overboard. Each ice cream that I tasted at Humphry Slocombe had a simple clean taste supported by a smooth, rich (but not overly so) body.\n\nThe first flavor that I tried was black sesame. If you have ever tried Beckmann's wonderful three-seed sourdough bread, this ice cream managed to capture that same tantalizing taste but in ice cream form. I tried a couple other flavors which were good too, although the flavors escape my memory now.\n\nI ultimately decided on the Secret Breakfast which is bourbon ice cream with corn flakes. The bourbon aspect of the ice cream was incredibly well done. The ice cream was just sweet enough and still maintained the warm gentle burn of bourbon in spite of being cool and creamy. The crunchiness of corn flakes provided an excellent textural contrast to the softness of the ice cream. Although it was a bit pricey, I feel that the high quality justified the price.

Glad I did, I really love their Secret Breakfast flavor which has some cornflakes and bourbon in it!  The ice cream had great smooth texture, but I would say that the cornflakes were a little on the chewier side.  I also tried the POG flavor which is a common juice in Hawaii (Passion Orange Guava).  The flavor was spot on to the juice I remember from Hawaii!  I also sampled the jasmine lychee which was also great holding hints of the tea and lychee and the creaminess of the ice cream itself.

And that's exactly what I got. However, the line moved fast and was worth it. The struggle I had was between the black sesame or oolong flavour, and I knew two scoops of ice cream would be too much. They both had very earthy flavours that weren't too sweet or overwhelming, that's my jam for ice cream and Humphry Slocombe definitely delivered.\n\nI ended up going with the oolong ice cream on a cone. The one downside was that the portion of ice cream was rather small. When most ice cream shops say \"one scoop\", its usually one scoop and a little more. However Humphry Slocombe was pretty literal with the \"one scoop\" such that once I got to the cone, there was no ice cream in the cone and I was just eating cone. A bummer end to such a wonderful eating experience... but clearly not too much of a bummer because I still rated this place five whole stars.", "author": "Pam H."}

My favorites are Jesus Juice, Blue Bottle and Secret Breakfast. This visit they had Banana Streusel. One sample spoon of the Banana and I was hooked. I ordered a scoop of Banana and a scoop of Blue Bottle. Blue Bottle always has the best sharp coffee flavor. Pure coffee perfection. The banana was refreshing. Small pieces of streusel combined with a strong banana flavor. A bite of the two together was like brunch in a spoon. A sharp bite of flavor with the coffee combined with the subtle banana bread flavorings. A perfect pairing.\n\nThe staff were smiling and seemed genuinely happy to be serving up scoop after the scoop to the ever growing lines of customers.\n\nI will always add this to my list of stops when in the area.

They are really efficient at serving you though so I guess the people before me were just slow choosers.\n\nAs per Yelpers, I tried the Secret Breakfast and the Four Barrel Vietnamese Coffee. The bourbon flavor is definitely evident in the Secret Breakfast and I don't really like bourbon so it wasn't for me, but the coffee was so so so spot on. Would definitely come back. I've had a lot of coffee flavors but this one is just perfection. Literally just tastes like coffee but in ice cream form. Texture is great--doesn't get all melty-like which is a quality I've noticed is pretty common amongst all these new gourmet ice cream places\n\nIt's expensive, but the scoops is definitely very generous as you can see in my photos.

Would that make her Truly Scrumptious-Slocombe? Because Humphry's ice cream is truly scrumptious, at least the flavors I favor like Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, but somehow the pixie dust got lost on the way from the Mission. That's probably because he took the 14 since that would make anyone homicidal or at least jaded about the world. I'm not sure what exactly happened on the trip or why it took so long for them to open at the Ferry Building.\n\nAll I know is that it's not the same satisfying experience here as it is in their little shop on Harrison. And that's a predicament for me and Jamie W. After all, the lines are long at both places, but the stampede mentality of the tourists here makes the wait more disheartening, especially since there is an equally long line at Blue Bottle across the hall. Needless to say, the congestion is unnerving and brings out the worst, anti-United Nations behavior out of the multilingual masses. As we waited for the samplers to try everything in the case, I perused the subway tiles and noticed the prices went up in the past couple of years as a two-scooper is now $5 whereas that used to get you a third (photo: http://bit.ly/1r77Kjw).\n\nBut given that you can get Humphry Slocombe at a lot of the trendier eateries in town now, I guess I shouldn't mind paying for their overhead. I didn't even bother sampling and threw caution to the wind. For something completely different, I had the Brown Butter with Blueberry Swirl and the Harvey Milk & Honey (photo: http://bit.ly/1ukHFyO). Good, creamy but surprisingly melty like their freezer wasn't gauged quite right. I've been back since and experienced the same meltiness.By the way, they're not very consistent on when they close in the evenings, as Jamie W. and I have come before their stated closing hour only to find them locked up for the night.

The service was very lackluster and I felt really rushed (despite the fact that it was 50 degrees out and the place was empty) We decided on the miso apple, secret breakfast and maple walnut. The miso apple tasted more like a cheesy fruity mix. I thought I liked it, but.... after a couple bites, I scooped up the rest and tossed it. The secret breakfast.... meh. Are people new to alcohol infused ice cream? Because this was really unimpressive.... The maple walnut was the best and that was the safest flavor choice. Despite the flavors, what really stood out was the fact that the base was super icy. I mean, chunks of ice with every bite. Yikes.\n\nThe flavors were ok, but it was the texture that really lowered the rating. Its already cold out, so why is my ice cream melting as though it was actually 100 degrees out? Right from the freezer, the ice cream already started drooping when the scooper put it on the cone stand.

OH-EM-GEE, what an amazing combo! The Secret Breakfast was flavored with Bourbon with cornflakes. What an awesome flavor. The ice cream was soft and the cornflakes brought a nice crunch texture. The salted caramel was also great! The small cocoa nibs offered a nice crunch as well and the flavors seemed to pop out at you! Both flavors were on point and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!\n\nI haven't tried the other big ice cream joints in the city, but after trying Humphry's, the others have a tough competition.

First off, you DEFINITELY have to go in a try the secret breakfast. No one else makes any thing close to this flavor and its description is cornflakes and bourbon--which can be a double edge for people who maybe don't like one, some or either of those two ingredients or just think it sounds plain weird. Don't bump it until you try it. It will melt in your mouth and give you a treat that you have never had before.

Do not trust these people when it comes to ice cream. In fact, you should seriously reconsider your relationship with them, and their general level of acumen about the world around them.\n\nPeople rave about Humphrey Slocombe because it has funky flavors. OK, I can take a live and let live attitude when I walk into an ice cream store that serves lavender ice cream or even bone marrow ice cream (not a hypothetical) alongside essentials like salted caramel or some kind of chocolate. But when you offer me Thai chili lime or Harvey Milk and Graham (admittedly, an awesome name), but not a single chocolate or vanilla or caramel ice cream, I call into question your commitment to the long and proud tradition of sticking cream in a cold container and churning until it becomes delicious.\n\nBut fine, Humphrey,  I will roll with you. I will judge you on your own freaky flavored grounds. People rave about your \"Secret breakfast\" (bourbon and cornflakes), and much to my surprise, it wasn't disgusting. In fact, my first bite was even good. So I ordered a cone.\n\nAnd hey, full marks for that:  A classic sugar cone, not one of those froufrou waffle cones that have been all too widely adopted. But hey, when your cone is the best thing about your ice cream, you are in trouble.\n\nThe ice cream itself has way, way too little butterfat. Very thin, even somewhat icy. I suppose the flavor intensity was OK, but how am I supposed to judge? I mean, I don't have anything to compare boozy cereal to unless I am a hard-core alcoholic who pours whiskey on my morning Cheerios.\n\nIn truth, this was perhaps a three-star ice cream, on a par with overreaching \"artisanal\" ice cream I will settle for on a hot day in a small town with no Bi-Rite Creamery.\n\nBut the fact that this place draws so much praise in a city with so many better options tells me that something has gone terribly wrong with the whole artisanal ice cream phenomenon and its emphasis on alternative flavours as opposed to essential quality. It even has me questioning foodie culture, and our society itself. When did we decide that something good and classic was less desirable than something mediocre but hip?\n\nThis ice cream tastes like existential despair.", "author": "Alexandra S."}

My friend and I were walking outside the ferry building and suddenly saw someone with an ice cream cone and realized we absolutely had to have one. Soooo we decided to explore the ferry building and ended up here. \n\nI've gotta say, this little shop is unlike any other ice cream shop i've ever been to. The flavors are all incredibly unique and intriguing. I wanted to try all of them but decided not to since the line was consistently long the entire time we were there and didn't want to hold everyone up. I ended up going with the Harvey Milk + Honey Graham and Black Sesame. Both were delicious! The black sesame was surprisingly sweet.

However, upon my visit to the ferry building at the Embarcardero, I was surprised to find their stand there! Their menu is written on a wall in clear bold print, so you pretty much won't be confused.\n\nI've heard about how tasty their ice cream is, and to my surprise, I was given the opportunity to try out almost all of the flavors (not the coffee ones because of lent, but when it's done maybe I'll take a whack at those).\n\nTo be clear, a LOT of their cream flavors have that saltiness to it. Idk about you, but the idea of putting salty and sweet together in ice cream works like hell for me. This isn't the \"insanely sweet\" ice cream you'd find at Baskin Robbins, but it's definitely worth trying.\n\nI sampled the following:\n\nOolong Tea: my favorite one. The taste of actual oolong tea is prominent in this one and there's also a slightly salty kick to it.\n\nPeanut Butter Curry: you would think, ew gross what?! BUT hot dang this one was unique. At first you get the peanuty taste of peanut butter, but as you taste it even longer, you will get the spicy curry kick to it also.\n\nSalted Caramel Cocoa Nib: ah, this is the exactly what I mean about \"salty and sweet\". You have a very salty base, but then the caramel sets in and you taste the sweetness within the saltiness, if that makes any sense.\n\nBasil Lemon Sorbet: this is a refreshing delight for the sunny days. The basil is very prominent in this one, with a very lemony citrus twist. And it's a sherbert, so there isn't any dairy in it. \n\nTahitian Vanilla: the classic vanilla is good, but Tahitian vanilla is great. Made with 5 different kinds of vanilla beans (as said by the worker assisting us) this one is very creamy, sweet, salty, and rich in texture. There is also that nice hint of bourbon in there also!\n\nMcEvoy Olive Oil: yup, you guess it. Olive oil. How does that work, who knows? All I know is that it worked perfectly here. It's actually really creamy and has a slight buttery taste to it. \n\nLemon Ginger Sorbet: oh oh oh I LOVE ginger, and this one tastes like citrus ginger! And it's a sherbet so it actually is really refreshing like the Basil Lemon. There's a spicy ginger taste to the citrusy lemon taste and it works so well!\n\nCinnamon Brittle: like french toast? This one's for you. It's a sweeter taste compared to the other flavors and it has that sweet cinnamony kick. It's creamy, and there's peanut brittle in every scoop!\n\nButter by Moodlight: not sure if its spelled \"moodlight\" or \"moonlight\" lol. This one is uber buttery is all I can tell you. I think this also had a hint of raspberry ribbon in it, but it was super buttery and creamy.\n\nSecret Breakfast: definitely something you could consider \"breakfast\". Creamy, rich, sweet saltiness that melts in your mouth with ease. Nommies.\n\nThe worker was super helpful, so that's a plus for customer service. It is a slight bit pricey for a scoop, but the ice cream is worth it, imo. \n\nI believe they also sell other things here too. Will I be back? You bet.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

With their unique flavors and signature 'Secret Breakfast', I find myself stopping by here often when at the ferry building. I have tried many of their flavors, including the popular vietnamese coffee and olive oil, but nothing compares to the solid chunks of cornflakes that are buried throughout secret breakfast. I also really enjoy the frosted almond topping that they offer. It adds a great crunchiness to the mix.\n\nIf you're feeling ambitious, try the coke float version with secret breakfast. It must be a million calories but it tastes great, like a whiskey coke with cream and cornflakes. \n\nI believe the original location is down in the mission near 24th as well.", "author": "Mark O."}

Humphrey Slocombe was one big overrated disappointment. In a city full of amazing ice cream artisans, this one ranks toward the bottom. At the end of my scoop, I fully regretted the whole experience. Service was decent. The eco-friendly utensils and cup was appreciated. But the ice cream was absolutely dreadful. I am glad most people love the pizzaz of out of the ordinary flavors like Anchor Steam Cream, Jalape\u00f1o Cornbread, and the famous Secret Breakfast. (All of which I either sampled or bought on this occasion) But what is not masked by the back-of-the-palette flavoring is the lack of good ice cream. \n\nCall me old fashioned but something has to be said about the quality of the ice cream itself. It does not hold well at all. On a typical chilly, windy SF day, Humphry's ice cream was almost melted by the time we reached the doorway. Understandably, ice cream melts. But considering that each exit is no more than 2 minutes away, therein lies a problem. I wanted a scoop of ice cream, not a milkshake.\n\nI was less than enthused with this soupy mess. Even the bites I had pre-melt were uninspired, which is ironic considering how most people feel how inspired Humphry's flavors are. When you can't even make a good basic Chocolate or Strawberry, it's just sad. The texture itself was somewhat icy, lacking any kind of smooth consistency. The ice cream felt unfinished, unsubstantial, just like the flavor. The base of this ice cream just did not exist.\n\nIt seems to me that Humphry's, with its menu items more outrageous than the next, is just compensating for the fact their ice cream is mediocre at best. The variety of flavors and catchy names are just hiding the vulnerability of their poor execution of making the actual ice cream. So, stick to Mr. and Mrs. and Bi-Rite. Sure, they may have similar flavor names, but don't let that fool you. I'll take those two over a hollow flavor bonanza any day.", "author": "Carlo D."}

There was a pretty long line of about 20 people in front of us. However the wait wasn't bad, it took about 10-15 minutes. I sampled the jalapeno cornbread, red hot banana, and toast and jam. I didn't like any of them, to be honest. The names sounded much more creative than the taste. I eventually got two scoops: blue bottle Vietnamese coffee and something something plum yogurt. I liked the coffee one because it was pretty thick and rich. The yogurt one was more icy and melted faster. I've had better ice cream overall at Bi-Rite or Marco Polo Gelato. This place is really just for satisfying tourists, plus it's right across from the Blue Bottle Coffee shop. I'm hoping the other Humphrey Slocombe is better.", "author": "Alice S."}

Go figure this subliminal stuff.\n\nIt's a very spartan shop and there may be more decorations coming; otherwise, it's a plan to have people focus on the ice cream.\nAt $4 for one scoop, it better be a pretty big scoop. The staff, at least, are very nice about offering tastes of all the ice cream that your conscience will allow you before you feel guilty enough for holding up the line.\nI tried three samples: Oolong tea, salted caramel with cocoa nibs and Browned butter.\n\nThe Oolong had a surprisingly direct flavor, not faint or wispy as I was expecting.\nThe Salted caramel had a nice full caramel flavor with the bits of chewy nibs sprinkled through. The Browned Butter was really lovely, a really satisfying sauteed buttery taste.\n\nPortion-wise, a single scoop seemed really small. But you do get a sugar cone if you want to or you could go the cup route.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy there is an ice cream vendor back in the Ferry Building.

So really, they should have no excuse at all to run out of those flavors!  And I love how they sell their Bourbon Float here as well, which is essentially their Secret Breakfast (Cornflake + Bourbon) and Mexican Coke, and to add more insult, a drizzle of Bourbon syrup.\n\nThe prices are pretty much along the same lines as their shop in the Mission.

So true to the name, so refreshing, and spicy. Not my cup of tea for ice cream, but you can just taste honesty and real stuff in this sorbet, which I deeply appreciate. The Blue Bottle coffee flavor was good but not amazing.\n\nThe matchadoodle is my cup of [matcha] tea. There are bits of crunch in there, lot of matcha flavor, and perfectly half-sweet.

Strong coffee flavor, but not too much of a bitter taste either. They really mastered the ice cream/strong coffee combination. I'm not too big of a fan of coffee or ice cream in general, but I definitely enjoyed this ice cream! \n\nThe lines can get long. I came for a single scoop right after my meal at Hog's, and it completed my night! It was a few minutes before closing, too but there was still a crowd of people waiting for ice cream.

I'm caught up on my tv shows, my hair is the longest it's ever been in my whole life, and I'm going out of the country for a month. \nWith this being said, one of my other dreams was to finally have secret breakfast from Humphrey Slocombe.\n\nThis was a flavor I had dreamt about, and even recommended to others. But every time I would go to try it, the line would be too long for me wait in. And twice, I was there before it was even open! \n\nBut finally, one Saturday afternoon, I did it.\nI had some time to kill. The line was still long, but I made it through. Now, would I just get one scoop of secret breakfast or two? Or try another? Stay tuned for the dramatic conclusion!\n\nSo I'm waiting in line, and I'm weighing out all the flavor possibilities to the same degree of deciding what my major in college is. I changed my mind a few times, but I decided on the roasted white chocolate lavender. \n\nI get to the counter, I don't taste test anything. I went into this blindly, like a blind date. Would I be catfished? There were no cones. They had ran out. Kind of a bummer.\n\nI got my two flavors. I walked outside to go sit by the water. \nAs I began to eat my ice cream, I felt fulfilled. One more dream had been completed. The roasted white chocolate was just that, roasted white chocolate... And a hint of lavender danced around at the end, like little jazz hands. \nThe secret breakfast was the better flavor though. A creamy bourbon flavor, not too strong. It didn't punch you in the mouth or burn your throat. It almost would give a novice drinker the false comfort of thinking they could drink bourbon and casually enjoy it without coughing and sputtering. The cornflakes were somehow not mushy.

In comparison to Ici's, which has been rotating the same conservative flavors since I started school in Berkeley, Humphry Slocombe has a far more interesting variety to offer. The more basic flavors of coffee and vanilla are accompanied by things like Olive Oil and Secret Breakfast.\n\nI tried Olive Oil, and it really had that sleek oily feel. It was quite strange because I was pretty sure oil wasn't supposed to taste that good. I think the ice cream here is a bit too sweet for my liking, but there are few places that can pull off these flavors better than Humphry Slocombe.

It's the cure to a hot summer's days, and on cold, rainy days I actually CRAVEEE it even more.  Every person in my home group knows my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor (Chunky Monkey!).\n\nSo, when I caught wind of this new ice cream spot so close to my work place, well, I consulted the wisdom? of weather.com to find the warmest day of the week, and reached out to my friend, JQ, who also shares my obsession with all things sweet.  A few hours ago, we found ourselves at the tail end of something that Ici in Berkeley would probably not even deign to call a \"line.\"  Strike one?  (On a side note, maybe strike one should have been their apocalyptic, straight outta the Book of Revelations, two-headed calf mascot with large, beady eyes).\n\nThey have their daily menu posted high up on the back wall, but also on a wall to the right of their shop.  \n\n10 ice cream flavors (on 3/21/14):\nSecret Breakfast\nBlue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee\nTahitian V*nill@\nMcEvoy Olive Oil\nOolong Tea\nChocolate Smoked Sea Salt\nPeanut Butter Chocolate Chip\nCinnamon Brittle\nSalted Caramel Cocoa Nib\nCream Cheese Chocolate Chip\n\n2 sorbet flavors (on 3/21/14):\nLemon Ginger Sorbet\nBasil Lime Sorbet\n\n+ Bourbon Coke Float (two scoops of Secret Breakfast, Bourbon Caramel + Coca Cola) - $6.50 + Tax\n\nToppings: Bourbon Caramel; frosted almonds; frosted peanuts - add $1\n\n1 Scoop - $4\n2 Scoops - $5\n3 Scoops - $6\nPints - $8.99 + Tax\n\nThe lady who took care of us was such a sweetheart.  She approached us with a smile on her face and lots of shiny tasting spoons clutched in her hands.  Wanting to practice some restraint, it is Lent after all, I asked to sample the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and the Oolong Tea.  From what I've heard from coffee connoisseur church friends, Blue Bottle is supposed to be this amazing Promised Land flowing with milk and honey (literally).  And from what I've experienced with Vietnamese Coffee, that is, \"Mama Said Knock You Out\" in liquid form, well... I was so underwhelmed.  Oolong Tea was mellow, but altogether too faint.  \n\nJQ asked to sample Secret Breakfast, but when she heard it had bourbon in it, told me that I should try it.  HR.  Riiiiiight.  After two fairly lackluster flavors, SB came in like a champ, though, with its distinct flavor and corn flake cookies to mix up the texture.  When she asked the woman what she would recommend, she simply said that she would recommend that we try everything.  \n\nWell.  In that case.\n\nI sampled Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, too.  I know that it's CREAM CHEESE, but it completely overwhelmed any hint of chocolate and thus succeeded in making me feel like I had essentially licked a brick of the Philly stuff.  Mm mm... no.  As for the PB Chocolate Chip, that was a little better balanced, but not a standout by any means.\n\nIn the end, I opted for the Secret Breakfast and Oolong Tea.  I know, I probably should have just gone with the SB, but their math totally got to me... why pay $4 for ONE scoop when you can get TWO at $2.50 each?!  I'm such a sucker.  T_T\n\nAnyway, JQ and I headed over to Sushirrito after for lunch, and on the way there, I had enough time to reflect on what I had gotten.  SB became altogether TOO sweet and the Oolong Tea began to taste very, very salty.  Ugh.  \n\nI'm not going to write this place off entirely, since they have many more flavors (http://www.humphryslocombe.com/www.humphryslocombe.com/Flavor_List.html) and they rotate daily, but I am a bit disappointed.", "author": "Iona C."}

The cayenne doesn't pull through as much when you are eating it, but 5 minutes later it starts kicking in and it's a nice, well if you are masochistic, nice burn/buzz in your throat. I think I went through a stage of hating it and a stage of loving it. Anyways, still not entirely sure about that intense price tag. Why is this place labeled as 1 dollar sign?

I asked the young woman who greeted me if I could sample three flavors before deciding on one, and she said yes.  After said tastings, I couldn't decide on just one, so I chose ALL of them.  I believe it was $3 for one scoop, $5 for two, and $8 for three.  It was the best $8 I've ever spent on dessert EVER. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/humphry-slocombe-ice-cream-san-francisco-4?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA&select=FXoXouI8DqqKTIJ8hMroaw#FXoXouI8DqqKTIJ8hMroaw\n\nBrown Sugar Fennel- Definitely felt crystals of sugar, but by no means grainy.  Dark caramel, and delicious floral fennel.  Mmm...\n\nHarvey Milk and Honey Graham- Honeyed graham.  Salt. Decadent, milky, shortbread.  I can still taste it!\n\nBlack Sesame- Toasted, smokey sesame.  Definite peanut flavor- I'm allergic to peanuts, so this was a bonus pleasure!  The sounds and textures of eating caramel wafers (think very thin waffle cookies, or a Kit Kat) sliding under each other...   Beautiful scoop of ice cream.

Located inside the ferry building, just look for the two headed cow sign and the long line and you will be there.\n\nYou are able to try out a few of the flavors prior to making your purchase. There is for sure some really different flavors here and for what I understand they change them around every so often. I tried the secret breakfast (bourbon and corn flakes), the salt and pepper one (yes, salt and pepper) and their cantaloupe cayanne (different, right?! I told ya! The cantaloupe cayanne was totally just how I imagined it to taste like. ) I was hoping that I would like the flavors to all of them being that I was feeling adventurous but sadly I didn't dig them all. We ordered a scoop of the secret breakfast (you do get the bourbon flavor in there) and a scoop of the blue bottle Vietnamese coffee. The coffee one was delicious and the best one there. Its enjoyable but soon you get tired of the taste, even though the scoop is small. The ice cream itself is creamy, rich in flavor and expensive! I'm guessing the hype and the different flavors allows them to have high prices since they obviously do not have any trouble having ice cream lovers line up. \n\nReason why I deducted stars was\n1. I was hoping to like more than just one or two of their flavors. I was expecting to be blown away (yes, maybe my expectations were high but heck, for a 15 minute wait and $4 a scoop, I am expecting a lot more than just weird flavors with rich ice cream)\n2. Service. The people working behind the counter are probably so annoyed and get irritated by the customers having to ask about this and that and try this flavor and then that one. I am assuming they are always super busy too so that doesn't help but as a customer service representing the Humphry company, its kinda sad that they weren't very friendly. The staff seemed to rush us on placing our order and being tourist here/out of towners and with a kid along for the ride, I would have wanted a bit more patience and felt a bit more valued.

It is an artisan ice cream parlor like Bi-Rite Creamery, but it features much more interesting flavors--unique sweet flavors and even a few savory flavors.  This new Humphry Slocombe location (the original location is in Mission) is in the very popular Ferry Building so lines can get extremely long here.\n\nHumphry Slocombe has many ice cream flavors in their arsenal, but they change by the day.  I tried their banana with cinnamon, which was interesting--a banana ice cream base with touches of spiciness and heat (kind of like eating banana ice cream with finely crushed Red Hots).\n\nI also had their secret breakfast, which was bourbon ice cream mixed with corn flake cookie clusters.  I liked the bourbon flavored ice cream.  It was creamy and sweet, but it also had a noticeable bitter burn.  The corn flake cookie clusters were okay.  They were not mixed that evenly through the ice cream so you only get big chunks here and there.  Also, while the corn flake clusters were tasty, the unique texture of the corn flakes did not really come through so it did not really create that cereal with milk and booze feeling that I believe was intended.\n\nPrices are high, but that is a given since Humphry Slocombe is in the Ferry Building.

Period, hands down, no contest. \n\nI had two flavors - the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and the Malted Milk Chocolate.

I didn't absolutely adore it at first but I could see it growing on me over time.\n\nBut then there was the Malted Milk Chocolate. \n\nIt was obvious that a generous helping of malted milk went into the preparation from the beginning. One thing I love - malted chocolate shakes. This was exactly that, only without the milk. Simply put, it was better than any malted chocolate shake I've ever had. Even simpler - it was better than any chocolate ice cream I've ever had. \n\nThe peripherals really don't matter in light of that, but - service was fast and friendly and prices were high-ish but reasonable as compared with how much everything costs at the Ferry Building.

My no-fail chocolate approach didn't go as expected. The Ancho Chocolate was yum in flavor, but thick and slimy in consistency.  The Breakfast Special (bourbon with frosted flakes), Browned Butter (self-describing), and Tahitian Vanilla were our sundae choices.  Seriously, can that just be my last meal?

I got there 5 minutes before the 7pm closing time and there was this lady standing at the end of the line. I nervously asked her if that means they are closed. She said yes. Disappointed, I explained I came all the way and if it wasn't that damn fire disrupting the T-line, I'd be there sooner. Luckily for me, she begrudgingly let me be the LAST customer for the day. Yayyy! I told her I planned to use my Kudos monies and she told me they are not accepting it at the Ferry Building and that the Mission location is going to phase it out soon. Whhhaaatttt? Ooopsie... \n\nWell, I still wanted my ice cream and I knew what I wanted. Got a scoop of Oolong and a scoop of Secret Breakfast. $5. When I was paying, the cashier recognized me from the Mission store from a particular incident involving 2 ice cream cakes A YEAR AGO and comped my ice cream. I learnt that the cashier (don't want to mention names) got promoted and she definitely deserved it. She did tell me that they are still accepting Kudos at both locations so that's nice. \n\nThe ice cream was as good as the Misison location.  Oolong tea had the subtle tea flavor and Secret Breakfast is still the reigning combo in the city. \n\nTo the tired HS employee that had to tell people you are closed, I understand that you are tired and want to go home but please don't be mean about it. You are the first impression of HS to those who just wanted to get some ice cream and it leaves a sour taste in their mouths that might turn them permanently off your establishment. Thank you for letting me in but your subsequent rants and complaints made it a very awkward and guilt-ridden wait for me.  \n\nTaste: 3 out of 3 stars. Customer service: 1 out of 1 (the guy who scooped my ice cream was very nice). Special mentions: That special individual who made my day so much better by comping my ice cream.

Cinnamon Brittle initially tasted equally delicious until I got half way through. Sad to admit but I'm a weenie and the cinnamon got too spicy for me.

It's right next door to Miette and replaces the old gelato place?\n\nWe had the Black Sesame and Secret Breakfast. The black sesame was awesome, and very mild. I'm usually put off by black sesame, but this wasn't too sesame-y and had a ton of sesame crisps to add texture. The superstar, however, was the Secret Breakfast. It has so much bourbon taste to it, and the cornflakes were more cookie-like. The only \"con\" to it was that it was a little too soft, almost melty. Our guess is because the bourbon doesn't allow the ice cream to freeze all too well.\n\nSo glad that this place opened up in the Ferry Building. It makes it way more convenient and accessible than going out to the original shop in the back of the Mission (which we did anyway two days later).

Current prices: $4 for a small single scoop, $5 for two scoops, $6 for 3. \n-Pro tip: Go for the $5 double scoop and choose two flavors that balance each other out!\n-I had the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee: amazingly sharp coffee flavor, not sweet at all. Just plain and simple, rich coffee, paired with Cinnamon Brittle: superr rich and creamy! Tasted like sweet cream with a kapow of cinnamon afterwards. You definitely will want something to balance out this flavor (hence why I got the coffee). Together they were the perfect pair :)\n-I also tasted the Butter by Moodlight: ice cream that tasted like heavenly butter with a little bit of blue berry, and McEvoy Olive Oil: had little bits and pings of citrus in it.\n-My other friends got Oolong Tea and Secret Breakfast. I'll have to try those out next time.

And, of course, there was bourbon. The ice-cream itself was creamy, smooth, and rich.\n\nIt was so good that I decided to come back and get the Vietnamese Blue Bottle coffee ice-cream too. Now, I am not a big fan of coffee, but this was exceptional. I liked it even more than the secret breakfast.\n\nExpect long lines, but they move fast.

We just couldn't pass up trying something as weird as Secret Breakfast Bourbon and Cornflakes flavor. Now thats a mouthful, both in name and flavor. First spoon taste and suddenly the world just disappears and all is left is you and this luscious ice cream. Yea we used a fancy word like that to describe it! Made me so sad when it was gone that really thought about order more or maybe a bucket to go. I could just eat it for every meal. Nah lets just replace all our meals with it. Its so sweet and refreshing made for a perfect dessert to enjoy outside while looking at the bay.

The sight of ice cream is more than enough for me to abandon dignity. The sight of Humphry Slocombe, of which I have heard great things about, in the farmer's market (Tuesdays and Saturdays) really made me ecstatic. Fine, Humphry guy, I'll be nice.\n\nToday's samplings were: bourbon breakfast, chocolate with smoked sea salt, and fluffernutter. I got a scoop ($3, $5 for 1/2 pint), and when my indecision was evident, the guy was nice enough to give me a little bit of everything (so glad I didn't sass him!). \n\nThe bourbon breakfast was my least favorite of the lot, but this is only the case because I still have to rank my favorites! It was still really very good. It was a different flavor that still delivered happiness to my mouth. The fluffernutter was peanut buttery without being overly so, and the chocolate was not too sweet and perfectly set off by the sea salt. The two flavors mixed together is the stuff dreams are made of. It was just truly fantastic -- especially in the middle of the frenetic energy of the farmers' market and with the Bay Bridge within view.\n\nSo yes, Mr. Humphry guy, I was indeed really excited to see you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-03", "description": "I came here a few weeks ago and had a little more room for Humphrey Slocombe's raved ice cream. We had previously eaten at Hog Island Oyster and felt like a cold treat since it was really hot outside and there was the crowded farmer's market happening.\n\nWe arrived at 12:20 PM and there was a relatively small line that made us wait about 5 minutes and gave us some time to decide on what we wanted. When we got to the front, we sampled some flavors and finally decided.\n\nHere's what we got:\n\nFor all 3 flavors, it was $7.50.\n\nCHOCOLATE SMOKED SEA SALT: This was okay but nothing spectacular and was probably my least favorite. After all for me, chocolate ice cream is chocolate ice cream. However, the thing that makes this version stand out is that the sea salt makes the chocolate ice cream more interesting while it doesn't overwhelm it. The texture of the ice cream is really nice because it's creamy but it was noticeably melting after a few minutes which is the mark of fresh ice cream. My only gripe was that the ice cream was too sweet for me.  They were pretty generous for this flavor.\n\nHARVEY MILK & HONEY GRAHAM: My favorite of the three flavors. It was a delicious milk ice cream with infused honey. I enjoyed this one more than the Three Twins one because it had graham crumble in it. The texture of the ice cream is once again super creamy but it didn't melt for us since this flavor was everyone's favorite and we finished it so quickly. My only gripe once again was that it was a tad too sweet for my liking but still nonetheless the combination was brilliant. They were pretty generous with the portion size.\n\nBLUE BOTTLE VIETNAMESE COFFEE: This was good but nothing that made this coffee flavor stand out from the other versions at other places. My favorite is still the Ciao Bella version because that one I can really taste the coffee flavor while this one it's much more subtle. Once again it was a tad too sweet for my liking and it did melt pretty quickly. They were very generous with the portion, however.\n\nBUTTER BY MOODLIGHT (SAMPLED): This is basically brown butter ice cream with blueberry swirl. I actually liked this because I really like blueberry ice creamy and the pairing of brown butter and blueberry swirl was really innovative and interesting. I would've ordered it but it was once again way too sweet for my liking. \n\nOTHER FLAVORS WE SAW WERE:\n-Secret Breakfast\n-Tahitian Vanilla\n-Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip\n-Oolong Tea\n-Cinnamon Brittle\n-Lemon Ginger Sorbet\n-POG Sorbet\n-Beach Blanket Babylon Banana\n\nSERVICE: They were really nice and patient with us since we each sampled a  flavor. They also explained their whimsical flavors one-by-one and never rushed us. There was a huge line after us and a little one before us yet they still didn't seem too bothered and they weren't stressed out. They were happy with what they were doing and I'm happy for them too. \n\nDECOR: The place is pretty cute and is easy to recognize with their easy to read sign and their 2 cow heads logo. The place really feels like an ice cream parlor and they use the walls to put their menu on. They also have shelves filled with other goodies and purchasable items. The only downfall is that there is no place to really sit and enjoy the ice cream.\n\nWill I return? Yes, I would but the only thing that keeps me from going back is that depending on the time of the day they do get pretty filled. Also, the flavors are a bit too sweet for my taste. Other than that, with their innovative, creative, and very delicious fresh ice cream, I would probably come here each time I'm in the area.", "author": "Jacquie H."}

However, I'd much rather have ice cream. That's not weird, right?! Thus, Humphrey Slocombe created this heavenly combination especially for me! Ok, not really. Breakfast, lunch and dinner is the perfect time for boozy ice cream. Or is that just me??! Creamy bourbon vanilla ice cream with a cornflake crunch for the win! Super tasty, especially on an ice cream cone! If you feel like having a caffeinated morning instead, Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee ice cream and oolong ice cream are totes to die for!

Listen, I love ice cream, but I think that other types of desserts are worth a shot because there are no places in Marin that have those certain desserts. And, because we were in San Francisco at The Slanted Door, my sister insisted that we go to Humphry Slocombe. I went here before, and I had a flavor that I have had success with before in a different place, but the ice cream here was... Not good. Ate a quarter of the ice cream before throwing it away. Now, back to the most recent time, I have been to another dessert place that was a bit farther away, and I freaking loved it, so I suggested the idea to the rest of the table. My sister, who did not like the place I suggested, really did not want to go there, so we went to Humphry. In a desperate attempt to avoid overpriced ice cream, I went through the rest of the ferry building to find another place that seemed I would like other than ice cream, but to no avail. I finally gave in and had a sample of two flavors I liked from other locations. I tried the horchata flavor, but it pales in comparison to the horchata shaved snow from Powder. I also tried the malted milk chocolate, because I like some chocolate ice cream. It also was not good. So, I ordered the vanilla thinking \"Ok, this is a classic flavor in ice cream. What could possibly go wrong?\" After the first bite, it was promising. However, as time went on, it just felt too strong for a vanilla flavor. So, threw it away after eating about half of it, wasting over 2 dollars in the process. I really don't understand the appeal. The line is usually very long and slow, the ice cream is way too expensive for the size, and it somehow can screw up the most simple flavor of ice cream. If you ever wind up going to a nice restaurant in SF, don't waste your time waiting a long time for overpriced ice cream. Spend it somewhere else, maybe at a good candy shop or bakery, or maybe another ice cream stand. It says top 5 in the country according to one source, but not in my book.", "author": "Desmond R."}

Graham cracker inclusion is simple, yet innovative. Sort of like what a child eats afterschool for snack.\n\nBlue bottle vietnamese coffee: Coffee flavor is strong.

Surrounding me were signs of a normal summer day: I was waiting in line for my ice cream, contemplating about the flavors, and swiping my smartphone; people around me were walking around with ice cream and the blue bottle iced coffee in hands, but who knew that this normal day would soon crash down unexpectedly by a bite of an ice cream. \n\nThe two flavors I have tried were the secret breakfast (recommended by the worker here) and the carrot mango sorbet, AND OH MY GOODNESS, MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WAS TOTALLY INTERRUPTED. IT WAS THE BEST ICE CREAM I EVER HAD, I LIKE IT BETTER THAN BI-RITE, THERE, I SAID IT, I LIKE IT BETTER THAN BI-RITE! I'm sorry but I can't lie to my heart. Every bite I took was glorious, and a different experience. \n\nThe secret breakfast was magical, It tasted sort of like a brioche french toast, but better because it's in the form of an ice cream. I tasted some syrup, and perhaps some liquor. In certain bites I got chunks of bread, which gave the ice cream more substance as a whole. It really works as a whole, and it was never so easy to say that it's the best ice cream flavor I have ever had.\n\nThe Carrot Mango sorbet was another world of its own too. The unique fresh flavors of the carrot tingles on my tongue, and then I got the warm sweetness from the mango. It was a sorbet, but it did not feel watery, instead it was quite substantial from the texture of the carrot and every bite was satisfying. \n\nI have to say that my favorite thing about this place is that it is honest. The ingredients really shines through, as it doesn't rely on all these unheard chemical ingredients to make it taste great. Compared to other ice cream, which has this sticky sweetness lingering in your mouth after taking a bite, it doesn't happen here at Humphry Slocombe. Here, the flavors of the ingredients are what lingers in your mouth. Humphry Slocombe has done this amazing accomplishment by bringing the quality and the flavors onto a level unseen (untasted) by me before.", "author": "David H."}

Humphry, how you make my taste buds dance in merriment and wonder of all the flavors that only you manage to put together so well!\n\nSo the usual highlight that is synonymous with Humphry Slocombe, if  you haven't heard by now is the Secret Breakfast, which is delicious when balanced just right. My Besties and I have gone here enough times to notice that each batch is slightly different from the last, so just asking for a sample can show you if it's to your liking or a bit too strong on the bourbon side. Although the Secret Breakfast is one of the big hitters, my personal favorite, when they have it, is the White Miso Pear! I swear, if this flavor were to magically turn into a man, I would ask him to marry me on the spot, soooooo good with the perfect amount of sweetness, and the creamy texture! \n\nNow that you know how I feel about the deliciousness that is Humphry's, let's talk about the peeps behind the counter.  A month or so back my Best Bud and I went to a game for the Giants Hello Kitty themed day, and we figured that since these guys were just a few blocks away we would give it a try, and head over after the game, but before they close, especially since we've been wanting to try the POG flavor.  The game probably ended around 6:45, and this place closes at 7:00!  But we're SERIOUS when it comes to our ice cream, so we pretty much ran from the ballpark to the Ferry Building as fast as we possibly could!  You can imagine our relief, when the staff decide to close the (crazy long) line right behind us!  Every five minutes or so, someone would ask the staff if they could squeeze in line, one guy even offered to pay extra! Just goes to show, how much people love their goods!  So we finally get to the counter, and ask for the POG, and of course, they just ran out!  But being the weirdos that we are, we still ask if we could just scrape the bottom to taste the flavor, and they totally accommodated, bringing us the mostly empty jug just smiling and giggling at us. (BTW, the small taste that we did get was pretty good!) I ended up going with the Harvey Milk and Honey that completely satisfies.  But the cherry on top of that visit was when we walk to the register, and the gentleman says that it's on the house!

One scoop is $4, two scoops is $6, three scoops... just a little over $7! It's obviously a no-brainer to get three scoops, especially when you have so many awesome flavors to choose from. :)\n\nI've tried a couple of flavors over several stops at this location, but I think my favorite flavors are from my most recent visit. The Pepper + Mint Chip flavor is #1 for me. It's not peppermint as traditional ice creams go; it's actually a pepper-flavored ice cream, with dark chocolate chips and hints of mint in the aftertaste. When you eat it, it tastes almost savory... The dark chocolate is the transition between savory to mildly sweet, and the mint provides a refreshing ending. It's probably not for everyone; the counter guy actually asked me if I wanted to taste it before scooping it. That made me a little unsure, but I am very glad I went with it - it's the most interesting and complex flavor I've had so far.\n\nThe other flavor I really liked was the Oolong Tea. If you like tea, you'll appreciate this flavor; the tea was unmistakable, deep, and creamy. \n\nI guess when I'm presented with non-traditional flavors at an ice cream shop, I tend to go for trying the \"weirdest\" ones on the menu. Maybe that's why I liked the Pepper + Mint Chip and Oolong Tea the most. In comparison to these two, the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Iced Coffee, while very good, was pedestrian. I found myself a little bored with it. But if you're in the mood for a good coffee ice cream, you can't go wrong with this flavor.\n\nNo stop at the Ferry Building is complete unless you get three scoops at Humphrey Slocombe. :) The line may seem daunting, but it moves relatively quickly and the counter guys are very friendly. Have your significant other grab two cups of Blue Bottle across the walkway while you hold down the fort in line!", "author": "Steph S."}

Everywhere from Toscanini's in Cambridge to that ice cream place Barak Obama went to in Bar Harbor. I've had frozen custard from southern Utah, and have visited all the \"best\" ice cream places in NorCal.\n\nHumphry Slocombe is the best. period. I've never had better.\n\nAll the flavors are amazing. Rich, flavorful, not too sweet. My favorite is vietnamese coffee, which they make with Blue Bottle coffee (best in the world). Get a cone, get a cup, deal with the fact that it's not that cheap, but if you love yourself, do yourself a favor and get yourself a cone of this ice cream next time you are in town. \n\nTip: If you are a bourbon lover, you have to try the Secret Breakfast. If you're not, like me, feel free to explore all the other amazing flavors.", "author": "Laura M."}

For the last one, I wanted to be a little exotic and try something new. One mistake I made was, that I did not try it first but ordered a scoop right away. Big mistake. Well, I was not pleased at all with the taste of the thai chili lime, it had an unpleasant aftertaste that reminded me of bad days...\nWell, the salted caramel was not bad. I would have left out the crumbs in there (they somewhat did not fit to the rest of the flavor) and would have called it burned caramel ice cream, since it tasted more like the latter one than like salted caramel. But I do also like burned caramel, therefore I liked this one.\n\nThe scoops are huge and worth the price! And the staff is very friendly and quick in taking orders. Another plus is that I like the branding concept and how the \"store\" looks like.\n\nNevertheless, I would prefer other ice cream places to this one. Sorry, I am sad about this too!

I have been meaning to venture out to his storefront in the Mission, but never got around to it while it was open.  Lucky me; I had the entire place pretty much to myself.  While not vegan, I'm not a big ice cream eater and it'd be unusual for me to eat ice cream more than five times in any given year.  That said, this was amazing.  It's creamy.  It's flavorful.  It's rich.  It's just delicious.  The Slocombe clan was generous about my sampling various flavors.  The ice cream is the true star here, as the two sorbet flavors didn't boast the creaminess or smoothness that I would have preferred.\n\nIt's not cheap ($4 for 1 scoop; $6 for two), but it's on par with my other favorites in San Francisco (Bi-Rite and Mitchell's), and reasonable for the quality.  The last time I had ice cream was at Bi-Rite in October, and maybe just because it's been so long my memory has been skewed, but this may very well be my new running favorite.  The Peanut Butter Chip was unbelievable.  The Salted Chocolate was decadent.  The Banana whatever-it-was-called was perfection.\n\nGo.  Enjoy.  Appreciate.\n\nOne day, I imagine, I'll cut dairy out of my life entirely.  Until then, on one of the few occasions I ever do eat ice cream, I'll look forward to the perfection that emanates from the ice chest of my friend Humphry.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Twice visited in The Mission but featuring new digs in a white tile space formerly inhabited by Ciao Bella it was moments before 8am that the hinged wall unfolded and stepping quickly into line smiles flourished - a few jokes about ice cream for breakfast and several samples leading to a $10 two-cup order.

Moving onward to my second dish it was more my willingness to indulge like a child than any need for hair of the dog that led to my 'double shot' of bourbon and with a name like Secret Breakfast the bourbon milk and cvornflake composition proved even more memorable when doused in boozy, hot caramel...a breakfast of champions indeed.", "author": "Michael U."}

This is the kind of ice cream with flavor that explodes in your mouth -- nothing artificial about it.  I went there today, Memorial Day, in the afternoon and there was a huge line.  I'm always willing to wait for ice cream, and they didn't disappoint.\nThere were about a half a dozen flavors that intrigued me, but I didn't want to seem like a piggy for trying all of them.  I asked the gentleman who helped me to pick two out of the list for me to try before I committed, and although there were about 50 people behind me in line, still offered to let me try all of them.  I declined though, and sampled both the salted caramel and strawberry.  Both had amazing flavor!  I went with the strawberry though -- you don't often find fruit ice creams with such true flavor and without the overwhelming sweetness.\nI agree with other reviewers about one scoop being enough.  It's rich, not like the usual ice cream you get at the store.  A perfect treat for a sunny day when you've done lots of walking!", "author": "Calee S."}

The flavors had no dimension. \n\nI tried eating more of the coffee and vanilla but eventually I threw that away too.\n\nI'm not sure but I felt like the ingredients were on the cheap side as well, which would explain the horrible taste.

It's ice cream, so it's always good... but not worth the lines/hype. \n\nI'm pleased to report that this one not only lives up to the hype, but is also worth that the wait. And I waited - close to 30 minutes. That's so long that it couldn't possibly be worth it -- but somehow, it was. \n\nGot two scoops - secret breakfast and some kind of beach blanket banana something or other.

I usually make my own ice cream now so that I can control the density.  The denser the better.  Humphry Slocombe never made my radar screen because it never looked dense enough to me.  However, the Secret Breakfast ice cream called to me Sat morning at 8am...I was surprised to find an ice cream place open at that hour but also pleased...there is nothing so good as ice cream for breakfast.  Well, I am not a big cornflake fan - just the opposite.  But I decided to give it a go and there was something wonderful going on with that ice cream.  Could it be the lightly sweetened corn flakes?  Hard to say but I was instantly addicted.  Whenever we are near the Ferry Plaza at breakfast time, I head for the ice cream counter and get one scoop of the Secret Breakfast.", "author": "Jean S."}

Finally did and... well... \"meh.\"\n\nI was really psyched while standing in line reading flavors and thinking they all sounded like good options.  Finally settled on the SECRET BREAKFAST cuz... I mean... where ELSE are you going to find bourbon and Corn Flakes in your ice cream? :D  Seriously good flavor.  Was very happy with the balance.  \n\nBut.\n\nThe ice cream was grainy.  The texture should be smooth and lush as velvet.  It was not.  Ice crystals and then the fat content was bizarre in that it made the roof of my mouth feel coated in cold butter.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I ate the whole single cone.  It cost a small fortune, so if it wasn't horrible, I was eatin' it.  \n\nI would not.  NOT... pay for another cone from them.  Sorry.  If they were half the price, perhaps, but it wasn't even remotely as amazing as the buzz led me to think.  Met a friend later that afternoon and told her I'd FINALLY had a cone from them and described my surprise at how underwhelmed I was and how weird the coated-roof-of-my-mouth felt.  She waited until I'd finished explaining and said she didn't think much of their product, either - specifically the coffee flavor.  Not impressive and certainly not the Coffee! flavor you'd expect from featuring a well-known coffee roaster (Blue Bottle) in the description.  Glad I at least didn't get that one.\n\nGood luck to 'em.  I know they have a loyal fan base.  The location and underground buzz alone will keep the place jumpin' (I was in the permanent portion of the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market in SF).", "author": "Raelene S."}

Perfect for dessert after eating at Gott's Roadside (if you have room for dessert, that is). I had a scoop of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and it was delicious! Really creamy and tasted like real, authentic Vietnamese coffee, distinctly different from your typical coffee-flavored ice cream. My boyfriend got the POG (Passionfruit Orange Guava) Sorbetto, which was also really good! It had a really fresh taste and you could really taste the combination of all three fruits. It wasn't artificial-tasting at all either. One scoop costs $4, which seems pricey until you see how generous the scoops are. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the Embarcadero area (it's less than 10 min from the Embarcadero Bart station) and look forward to trying some of there more unusual flavors, like Secret Breakfast, which, according to the guy that served us our ice cream, Humphry Slocombe is best known for.", "author": "Corinna S."}

I would give these guys five stars except the selection is extremely limited, the staff is professional and quick but they are robotic and don't interact well.
