I appreciated how all the packaging used was compostable.\n\nThe entrees were delicious, and the wonton chips were crunchy and fatty -- just the way I like them!\n\nMy co-worker and I ordered the following, which amounted to $30:\n- 1 original poke\n- 1 salmon poke\n- 2 orders of rice\n\nAfter tax, tip, and the delivery fee, our total order was just over $40.

I was surprised to see the restaurant had changed so much. It's now just a poke joint. Although they still have some old favorites, almost every table had at least one poke bowl order.\n\nThe menu is a bit confusing. There's a poke section in the front and a rice bowl section (that has poke) later in the menu. My partner ordered from the poke section and was asked if they wanted rice, while I ordered from the rice bowl section. [SPOILER ALERT: They just charged us for two rice bowls with poke].\n\nThe bowl is a decent size, but you can usually get more toppings at a cheaper price at any other poke place. Overall it's pretty standard, aside from the addition of cilantro to the salad section.\n\nService was so-so. Jeffrey tried to grab my bowl while I was still eating for some reason. He also failed to clarify that we ordered the exact same thing (albeit from two different sections). We were kind of surprised when the order came out.\n\nOverall if you want poke, you might as well just go to one of the many places that specialize in it now.\n\nProtip: Happy hour varies by location.

We have been to the Pacific Catch in Downtown San Mateo a few times before, and I was expecting the same service, atmosphere, and great taste.  This location had 2/3.  It looks small from the outside, and looks are not deceiving.  We walked in, and since we had a wheelchair, we were told that there was only one option for tables since it is packed so tightly.  It was right next to the door, and we were greeted by the cold, gusty, SF wind whenever someone opened the door.  \n\nThey served a small side-dish of edamame, but sans pretzel goldfish (San Mateo had these!) and it was salty!  The server was friendly and helpful with the recommendations.  It was happy hour, so we were able to get the California Poke for $6 (his recommendation).  The poke was good, and it will keep me coming back to Pacific Catch.  We shared a 3-piece fish and chips with seasoned fries and a side of chipotle sauce per the server's recommendation (yum!).  It was the right amount of food, perfectly flavored, and crispy..and not too oily!  Our tummys were definitely satisfied.  \n\nIt's hard to get to the restroom if the bar is fully seated, which was the case at 5pm.  My girlfriend who is in a wheelchair had to use the restroom at the food spot next door so we didn't disrupt 10+ people during their meals.  We asked if there was a back entrance, but the staff told us there was a step, and then advised us to ask the restaurant next door.  They were helpful at least.\n\n3 stars because the food never disappoints and the staff were friendly and helpful.

I've gotten it with half salad/half brown rice with Salmon at least a dozen times and it never disappoints. Delicious glaze but still feels like a healthy meal.

Decided to try this place out since it's close to my work. They have their own tiny parking lot but it can only fit like 6 cars in there. We were seated by the host right away when we got in. Tons of open table in the afternoon. I got the Japanese wasabi rice bowl with Hawaiian poke with extra poke for $5 extra. It was pretty good but I thought it was a little too salty for me and way too much rice. My boyfriend got then lobster roll with sweet potato fries. Surprisingly it was really good!

The dressing is a light version of the miso you get all Japanese restaurants, y'know the kind that smothers iceberg to death, but here they know a little goes a long way. \n\nReally, everything was fresh, clean, colorful, and affordable, and everyone here is easy going and just, cool.

Fresh, delicious, filling dishes that are totally worth the price that you're paying.\n\nI took my mom and sister here when they visited me over Labor Day Weekend. We didn't have our weekend plans set in stone at all, so we just walked in on a Saturday night. The hostess was super flexible and said that though the tables were full now, she would call me when the next one was available so that I didn't have to wait outside in the cold - very generous! Also, the starter plate of edamame beans was such a delightful and unexpected treat to start off our meal. (If you're getting a rice bowl, save some of the edamame to mix into your main dish - it adds so much texture!)\n\nMy mom and I are huge fans of raw fish, so getting to try the Hawaiian Poke was a must! We both wound up getting the Japanese Wasabi Rice Bowls with Hawaiian Poke, and we were so impressed. Everything from the taste to the quality of the ingredients was just outstanding. The poke itself has a lot of flavor, and I could totally just eat a bowl of it by itself. We got our rice bowls with half rice half salad, which was a refreshing swap-out, since the greens just made the dish that much lighter and more refreshing. I will say that the sauce was pretty strong with the Wasabi flavor, so if you're not a fan, maybe go for a different rice bowl. My mom also got a lot of sauce in her bowl, so that was a little overwhelming for her... if you're sensitive to too much sauce, definitely ask the waiter/waitress to make note for light sauce!\n\nMy sister got the Korean Barbecue Skirt Steak Rice Bowl. She is a super picky eater, so I was super surprised and happy to find that she actually really liked her dish! The steak is cooked a perfect medium rare, and the toppings mesh perfectly with the Korean Barbecue sauce. The sauce was kind of splotched onto the rice in the bowl though, so there were some areas that had a lot of sauce while some didn't have any at all... and there was no way to mix it all together evenly. Overall, a delicious dish though - loved the shaved omelette as an addition to the bowl :)\n\nService is super fast, so even for walk-ins, I don't think you have to wait super long (but there is limited seating, so try to get to the restaurant early if you don't have a reservation).\n\nFlavor profile was fantastic and really tickled my taste buds.

All of it was delicious and fresh tasting. Quite possibly the healthiest and most delicious meal I have eaten while on vacation.

The crispy little won tons were great to snack on as well. \n\nWe had the calamari. $6-8? I don't remember the price. They were crispy and flavorful! The also do a little something different.

The salads were delicious as well. The whole bowl was rather refreshing and I didn't feel too guilty about eating it! However, I feel like there was way too much of the brown rice, even with the half salad option.\n\nAs for my friend, she loved her tacos!\n\nThe drink menu was alright as they had some wines and some craft beers, but I really wanted some sake. Anyway, I ordered the the coconut porter by Maui Brewing and was immediately handed a can and a nice frosty glass. I would recommend getting that if you enjoy craft beers.  \n\nThis location is wonderful! Okay, so the view from the restaurant isn't that great.

As in, you bite into it and it feels like cardboard with that musty smell from a bag bought 6 months ago.\n\nNext - the korean style ribs. Ribs are actually something that has some tolerance for takeout since they are often moist and don't require a crunchy texture like fried food would. But again, old, dry and the sauce tasted like salted vinegar. It was gross. Again, common sense - don't serve overcooked, old pork. \n\nThe rest of the orders were largely forgettable. Poke was fine.

You have an option to allow for 1/2 greens, 1/2 rice instead of mainly rice and this is a great idea because believe me, the amount of rice is generous in the half option. I loved the dollops of pickled ginger, daikon, shredded nori, sprouts avocado and greens because I'm the ultimate clockwise eater. The sesame seeds complimented the entire shebang perfectly and just let me bathe in the accompanying wasabi tamari sauce (our awesome server gave me extra, unprompted, when I mentioned that I'm a sauce fanatic). My G/F dining companion appreciated all the options and they of course brought a G/F soy sauce along with regular. They care here! \n\nIf I lived close by, I'd order out here on the regular for sure. The ambiance may not be my cup of tea exactly, but the food is just what I'm always looking for when I don't have time to whip up a healthy, satisfying meal.", "author": "Joi B."}

With that said when I ordered the \"chalkboard special\" of rainbow trout (which I was super excited for since I haven't had it since I was a kid) it came out looking decent, skin was crispy lookin, half the fish had a green sauce half a red sauce. \n\nAs I started digging in I started on the green sauce side. Sauce was tasty, fish was a little dry but skin was still crispy so whatevs, I pressed on. By the time I got to the red side I realized the skin was no longer crispy since it had been sitting in the juice from the beans, salsa and coleslaw on the plate .  After my first bite of fish with the red sauce my tastebuds were immediately annihilated by the heat from the spices... don't get me wrong. I like a good kick to some foods but when eating something like trout that has its own distinct flavor that I'm looking for a mouth numbing amount of spice is not what I want. From that bite on I was only able to imagine the taste of the fish. \n\nPretty disappointed since this is supposed to be a fish place yet they hide the fish behind way too much spicy heat.", "author": "John S."}

I finally got to try it, and I don't think it fully lived up to my expectations.\n\nI ordered the California Style Poke, which is ahi tuna with crab, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, mixed in a lemon aioli, and topped with shredded dry seaweed, served with crispy chips. The texture tuna tasted like it was seared, which wasn't stated on the menu, so I was a bit thrown off when I took my first bite. I could barely taste the fish, which was drowning in a sea of other flavors (pun intended, hah). I did like it though, don't get me wrong, but this may be a good dish for those who are just getting used to eating raw fish. For the more experienced, go with the Original or Salmon, which look like they're not overpowered by a myriad of other stuff.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really small. There was only one table that could fit more than four people, another one or two tables for four, and a bar seating area for maybe six people. If you're really craving Pacific Catch, your best bet would probably be to order to go so you don't have to stand squished next to the door waiting to be seated in the tiny tiny space.", "author": "Sabrina C."}

We weren't able to make it here for happy hour but I definitely have heard good things about the happy hour!\n\nWhen we arrived around 6:30pm, it was really busy and packed! The hostess told us it'll take about 15 minutes for a table, the wait was definitely shorter than that. \n\nWe were seated in a promptly manner. I like the little dish they give you when they serve you your water, it looks like its edamame and little pretzels. Yum!\n\nWe decided to order the calamari and the mixed catch basket with spicy fries. The server had a good sense of humor and was very nice. He asked if we wanted our calamari as an appetizer and the other dish later. We did, so we were served our calamari first.\n\nFood:\n\nCalamari - I like the sauce that comes with it. Beware, there is a kick to it! The calamari came out cool/luke warm, which makes me think it wasn't freshly deep fried which is a little disappointing. I think it was well-battered and crispy. I like it, but then again, how can you go wrong with calamari? If you make it wrong, then I am just speechless. Calamari is usually my safety to-go dish. \n\nMixed Catch Basket - So I definitely like the spicy fries. I don't think it's spicy but the cajun taste is distinct. I like dipping in the sweet thai chili sauce. Although I have a bottle of sweet thai chili sauce at home, I still like it. The sauce is nothing special. You go to an asian grocery store and you buy the sweet chili sauce that looks the same color. It is such a tasty sauce though! I like the oysters and shrimp in this dish. For some reason, I wasn't expecting the shrimp to be so coconut-y but it did describe that to me in the menu. The fish was a little dry and a little boring, I wasn't impressed. I think the fries wowed me out of everything in the dish because it was unique. The fried foods were fresh and crispy. No one likes soggy fried foods.\n\nNot bad place for fusion seafood, but also it doesn't make me go WOW, I need to come back again.\n\nNote: If you are a UCSF student, tell them you're a UCSF student so they can give you 10% off.", "author": "Margaret L."}

Both times I've been here the food has has definitely been filling, but not satisfying. General flavor of the fish tacos/poke bowls is nothing crazy delicious or out of the norm. I think you're mainly paying for the nicely decorated plates, trendy Marina location and oversubscribed real estate (hence, the crazily limited and narrow restaurant seating?) . \n\nMost recently, the fried calamari appetizer we ordered had an over-salted batter and my wasabi salmon poke bowl was not at all fresh. Salmon pieces seemed mildly cooked from sitting out in the heat all day. The bowl's redeeming quality was probably the miso dressing, cold seaweed salad, and overall healthy feel.\n\nGiven Pacific Catch enough tries and not coming back unless they figure out some secret sauce!", "author": "Arushi S."}

We both had a variation of the Hawaiian Poke wasabi rice bowl and it was literally the best tasting sashimi I've had in my entire life. The soy marinade was perfect and must've included some sesame oil. The salt level was never offensive and unffffff just believe me when I say this made me all tingly on the inside.

These can be pushed together if you have a party of four. There are also a few seats outside and some stools at the counter but I prefer to sit at a table where it is not so chilly. I would not come here with a big group since there is such limited seating. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nJapanese Wasabi Bowl with Hawaiian Poke and Seared Ahi ($15.5 + $4.5 since we got two meats): The bowl traditionally comes with rice but can be substituted with half rice, half greens or all greens. We chose to go with all greens. I'm always pleased when restaurants let me trade rice for something more delicious and nutritious. Between the poke and the ahi, I would definitely choose the poke. The searing on the ahi is nice but the poke has great flavor. The sauce is tangy and intense with a little spicy heat. The salad dressing has a wasabi taste and a bit of heat. There's also mixed greens, wakame salad, and ginger. Overall, I think it was a pretty healthy meal and it comes in a big bowl. My bf and I split this dish. At the end I was full but he was still hungry. I think he would have been more satisfied if he'd gotten his own bowl. \n\nWakame Salad ($4): We were originally going to get the roasted vegetables until the waitress informed us that the vegetable was corn! I do not consider corn to be a vegetable. I am very thankful she told us beforehand or I would have been very disappointed. However, the wakame salad was just okay. It reminded me of the seaweed salad from Costco. I'd skip this dish. \n\nService: Friendly and attentive. No complaints here.\n\nOverall: If I came back I would order the Japanese Wasabi bowl again but with poke only.", "author": "Ella C."}

I thought this demonstrated great customer service and so I am increasing my rating by 1 star.\n\nI dislike restaurants that overprice their meals and restaurants that don't serve tasty food. Unfortunately, Pacific Catch commits both these sins.\n\nI ordered two baja fish tacos (made with the daily catch, cod) with the side salad. Sadly, the tacos was terrible. This came from the fact that other than a little cabbage, the only flavor in the taco came from heaps of green salsa that tasted weirdly bitter/sour all at once. The fish itself had no flavor (or maybe it did and the salsa fried off my tastebuds so I couldn't taste it??). Yuck! I will say that the side salad was delicious, with great dressing and crunch from the edamame. \n\nTo make matters worse, my meal came to $17 after tip, which in my opinion is way too much to pay for two tacos at lunchtime, especially ones that didn't even taste good! I really wanted to like this place, because I love seafood and because the menu here has so many interesting-sounding dishes. I might give it another try because of the positive yelp reviews and because the menu has many interesting items on it, but unfortunately I can't give it any more than 2 stars right now.\n\nTip: Take advantage of the outdoor seating!

At first, I thought I walked into a wrong restaurant. I checked the menu and realized that it is the one. We got there at 5:45 and I asked the waitress if we could order from the happy hour menu, the waitress responded \"yes, as long as you order it before 6.\" She immediately seated us and let us looked at the menu. Unfortunately, because we really want to place an order as soon as possible, we had not choice besides sitting at the bar for party of 3.\n\nWe ordered the poke bowl from regular menu, and from the happy hour menu we ordered coconut shrimp, California poke, sweet potato fries and calamari. The food were served pretty quickly, it took only 10-15 minutes. The sweet potato fries were so good. Every time I go back, I always ordered sweet potato fries and I always wanted to get more at the end. I used not to like sweet potato fries, but after trying their sweet potato fries, every once awhile I have a craving for the sweet potato fries. It was amazing. The coconut shrimp is very crunchy. The poke bowl was really good. My friends tried one from Hawaii and she said this poke bowl reminds her of her experience in Hawaii. She loves it. \n\nI highly recommend everyone to try their sweet potato fries, especially people who don't like sweet potato fries.

I've been to the Marina location and the San Jose location and both have the same menu and the same excellent quality. \n\nI usually think of Pacific Catch as more of a lunch place, since they serve lots of seafood-themed salads and sandwiches, but I definitely wouldn't mind getting one of their rice bowls for dinner!\n\nThe Pacific Catch in the Marina is quite small and so it's definitely NOT a great option for groups. The last time I went, Ms. M and I grabbed the last seats at the bar. \n\nI think that for what they serve (i.e. fresh fish and fresh produce) and for the cooking technique (I've never had an overcooked piece of fish here), the prices are on point. They have an assortment of starters, and the Korean Ribs ($11) always catch my eye (and I saw the chefs preparing this dish and they look awesome), but it is hard not to stick to fish! They also offer \"Meal Sized Salads\" (hell yes), with prices ranging from $10.50 for their veggie salad to $15 for their real crab salad. They also have fish and chips ($10-$14), sandwiches with a choice of side ($12.50), tacos, and island bowls with an assortment of proteins ($15).\n\nSo far, I've tried (see photos):\n\nSalmon Sandwich ($12.5) - Grilled salmon, avocado, tomato, and citrus aioli. The salmon was juicy and tender. The aioli was also creamy and delicious. And, I highly, highly recommend that you choose the sweet potato fries over the side salad. I think it may be $2 extra, but Pacific Catch is actually my favorite place for sweet potato fries. Ms. M thinks that they are so good here because they cut the fries at the perfect size.\n\nCrab Salad ($15) - Real crab, avocado, cucumber, ginger, carrots, & shredded nori with soy-wasabi vinaigrette. This salad is HUGE and it is SO good. All of the ingredients are fresh fresh fresh and the balance of the flavors is excellent. The dressing was tangy and flavorful and the crab added savoriness and texture. I also thought that the amount of crab given was quite generous. I ate this after a morning run at Crissy Field, and thought it was the perfect post-workout lunch. I would definitely order this again!\n\nFinally, I would also add that my favorite vegetarian apparently loves the Pan Asian Bowl with half salad / half rice (apparently this is something you can request) and tofu! She apparently thinks the tofu here is amazing! Since I'm going demi-veg these days, I will absolutely be ordering this next time :).", "author": "Eileen E."}

I was walking through Fort Mason with a friend and having moved to the Bay area recently, we saw a jogger through the park and asked where to go...she suggested we try this place out, and now, I want to thank this kind civilian for sharing such a wonderful food providing spot for us to check out. I am forever grateful mystery jogger!\n\nThe prices are great, we sat up right at the bar, watched the chef's cook everything up, looked fresh, delicious, and smelled amazing. Service was great, food was prepared fast, and served up nicely in plates. I ordered the Korean BBQ bowl, my friend and husband ordered the fish and chips and everything was eaten with \"oh my mmmMmm! mmmM's!\" after every bite. \n\nWe also ordered up some calamari to get started on our feast and wow, it may just be the best I've ever had. Prepared perfectly, not fried too much, but just enough..and they come with some amazing dipping sauce and peppers. Now imagine a smiley happy face. Yup, that's what I think we looked like eating this. Order some for an instant smile!\n\nThe fish and chips isn't your typical dish. This one comes with amazing fries, fish, fried oysters, and fried coconut shrimp. DEEEEEELISH! The Korean BBQ comes with a variety of meat or fish but I chose the grilled salmon. It was perfectly prepared. \n\nWe loved it so much, that we ventured into the Marina all the way from Berkeley just to eat here 2 days after the first time we went. It was glorious and highly recommend you check it out if you haven't yet!", "author": "Akvile D."}

Her husband dropped us off to find parking couple blocks down from the restaurant.  This is a very busy area so parking can get tricky especially on the weekends.  The restaurant is very small and fits barely 20 people.  There is a dog friendly patio outside but that's limited to 6-8 seating.  However, it's worth the wait.  \n\nThe menu is quite interesting where you can order your choice of taco's but still be able to share a bowl of Hawaiian or Korean mixed rice bowl with a side of cilantro and hot sauce.  The dishes are very well prepared with fresh ingredients and there's something for all those picky diners.  \n\nIt was hard for me to decide between the sashimi bowl and their famous fish taco's.  If I could eat both, I would've ordered those two dishes!  Instead I have  decided to stick with what they were known for and also couldn't resist after looking at someone else bite into their fish taco.  \n\nWe ordered the poke and fried oysters as our appetizers.  It was a perfect start to calm our hungry growling tummies.  My three fish tacos came with either the sweet potato fries or the spicy fries.  I'm glad to have ordered their sweet potato fries!  Everything came out piping hot and very fresh.  \n\nToo bad LA doesn't have a Pacific Catch.  I can understand and feel Michelle T.'s sadness that we both don't live closer to this restaurant!

They were ok, I think you can get the same taste at other places. For fish and chips we got the mixed catch basket which had fish, shrimp, and oysters. The fish and shrimp tasted pretty good and I looove tartar sauce. I'm not a fan of oysters though, but that's just me.\n\nThe food was good but not amazing.

Would it be as simple as calling this place Little Pacific Catch?  Maybe not, but we'll never know, because it feels like a bait-and-switch even though it might technically not be.  Or maybe a smaller menu would help?  Something just feels off about offering the full menu in a decidedly less than full dining room.\n\nThe service is fine, but a couple of the people who helped us were snarky.

You can select your protein over a generous bed of vegetables and avocado, and we opted for the hawaiian poke. The fish was bright red and juicy (very Instagram friendly) with a satisfying, not-too-tender texture. It was wonderfully seasoned with sesame and some kind of garlicy herb to add a finishing kick. Not quite like sashimi but still raw, it was unlike any other fish dish I had tried before! With the bowls, there are also options for having brown rice, and making the bowl 1/2 rice 1/2 salad. \n\nThe three of us also ordered three tacos, which we were able to individually select. We tried the popcorn shrimp, steak, and grilled mahi mahi. These were so good!! They all had a salsa/guac base with slight variations depending on the meat. The steak was my favorite, followed by the slightly sweet popcorn shrimp. It's in the details, but I like how we were able to choose one of each taco to sample the different flavors-- many restaurants don't allow for this kind of flexibility. \n\nIf you're into fresh seafood presented with interesting fusion flavors, I would definitely recommend making a trip up to the Marina just for this restaurant.", "author": "Angela H."}

It's like there was POOL of a cup of a dressing at the bottom of the bowl.   \n\nNever, ever again.  Even if you got the dressing on the side, something was really off here.  The salad itself including tax and tip was $19.  Omfg, not worth it to leave half.  (Waitress nice tho).", "author": "T S."}

We ordered the calamari appetizer and upon recommendation from the server, ordered one ahi poke wasabi bowl to share. The calamari was really crisp and tasty. Not oily at all. It also came with lemon tempura mixed with the calamari which was a tasty surprise! It kind of reminded me of the basil those boba places fry with crispy chicken. Tapioca Express anyone? The chipotle mayo sauce they provided with the calamari was too salty for our taste buds. The calamari was already seasoned so they tasted better w/out the sauce. \n\nThe server was really cool and without us even asking, she split the ahi poke wasabi bowl into two separate bowls. I thought that was really thoughtful of her. And for $12, this was a really good deal. I loved the fresh combination of tuna, avocado, seaweed salad, and ginger on top of rice. I have to note, however, that we found the soy seasoning for the poke to be a little too salty as well. It soaked into the rice so most of our rice was salty and it was a kinda hard to finish. We did finish all the tuna and other toppings though!\n\nI still want to give this place 4 stars because of its location as well as the quality and price of the food.

How could it not be? All six tables were in the space of a king-size mattress. Kind of hard to get forgotten. But friendly nonetheless. There were several people picking up takeout. I have a feeling that's pretty common. Folks know there is no way they will get a table so they order for pickup instead.\n\nAn excellent option if you are in the area.

Each rice bowl is prepared in one of three styles: Japanese Wasabi (sushi inspired), Hawaiian Teriyaki (sweet & tangy) and/or Korean BBQ (korean cuisine).\n\nI went with the Japanese Wasabi and opted for the healthier brown rice. The Seared Ahi caught my eye (slightly raw tuna) and chose that as my meat.\n\nI was taking it to-go and ordered a couple more things. Their sweet potatoes fries as an appetizer and two desserts items, which I got for free because it was my first time checking in with Foursquare (such a sweet deal).\n\nThe rice bowl was AMAZING! They mixed the rice in a soy-wasabi sauce which complimented the Seared Ahi quite nicely. It tasted subtly spicy and rather healthy. The filling portion was large and also included wakame salad, avocado, sprouts, daikon salad, ginger, sesame seeds and shredded nori. As a to-go order this was all spread out on a wide and recyclable paper plate.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were pretty addicting but what I became of fan of was their Fried Dulce de Leche \"Spring Rolls\". It tasted like fried heaven! At first glance it looks like a largely lumpia or fried egg roll, but once you bite into it you'll receive the sweet flavor of vanilla cheesecake & caramel sauce. They even give you extra caramel sauce on the side if you want some more sweet dipping action. The second dessert item I got was their lychee ice cream. It was nothing special, but I hear they change their flavors every month.\n\nI enjoyed this all in the comfort of my apartment. It's a good spot to grab dinner on the go as long as you call ahead of time. This location is small but looks cozy. Maybe I'll sit in next time.", "author": "Andrew C."}

I checked out the menu and we agreed to hang out here for the night.\n\nThe venue is SMALL. Like...don't talk about dirty things at the dinner table because the people next to you can hear you small. I think this place can accomodate about 25-30 people safely and that MIGHT be an exaggeration.\n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes we were seated at the counter. I Would have preferred a table, but at this point, I'm not being picky.\n\nMenu was a little all over the place for me. Didn't see anything that really stood out and ended up ordering the Coconut Shrimp with a side of coleslaw. It was okay. A lot of shrimp for the buck. Accompanying slaw was pretty legit also. Nothing mouth dropping, but enjoyable.\n\nAlso, someone should consider taking a couple of the stools from the counter area. I found myself constantly nudging the girl on my right and I'm pretty sure she thought I was trying to start a fight with her, haha.\n\nFinal verdict, enjoyed the meal but definitely won't need to come back here anytime soon.", "author": "Trav M."}

The daikon is actually my favorite part of the salad. I never really thought of myself as a \"daikon-guy\" but there you go. \n\nThe sweet potato fries are fantastic, although I find the paired chili sauce a little too sticky-sweet. I think the fries actually taste better unadorned (or maybe with daikon).\n\nLast time I came here my friend ordered the mochi balls. You get a thing of fondue to dip them in, and I'll be darned if that's not a great time. It was very nice of her to let me eat most of them. \n\nThe outdoor seating is awesome on a nice day. Plenty of good people/little-dog watching. I like to make a big show of how healthy I eat here, so I usually stop a couple of passerbys and teach them the evils of processed carbohydrates. Try it!

The fish was cooked perfectly! Moist, and not flaky.\nMy friend got the poke wasabi rice bowl. I mooched a piece of his, and I liked it... probably better than my salmon! His fish was drenched with sauce and made it too salty after a couple of bites, though. Oh yeah... and we got the basket of sweet potato fries, which were eh. My friend really likes sweet potato fries so he adored them but me, it was whatevs. Sadly, we came here for a really late lunch and ordered 10 minutes before happy hour and the waiter didn't give us the happy hour discount on the fries =/ Oh well... It was only $2 cheaper.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here. It's like a Japanese-seafood house fusion... pretty nifty! Never been anywhere like here before. I like.

We were staying near Fort Mason and didn't have a car so we were restricted to 1 mile radius for foods. After short search, we decided to check this place solely on ratings and boy they are correct!\n\nWhen we got there, the place was already full, the cute waitress told us it'll be 5 minutes for a table to open up so we waited outside. However, about 4 minutes later, another couple walked in and sat on table where we were suppose to be seated. The waitress was so busy she couldn't tell them there was line front of them -- she apologized and offered us an appetizer for wrong-doing (we were okay with it either way, but will take free food!).\n\nWhen we were seated, she quickly brought the house-famous sweet potato fries with two kinds of sauce - white and red. The white sauce was amazing... I'm not sure what they are but great. We also noticed everyone else having this mysterious orange drink -- we ordered ones too, turned out to be Thai Iced Tea - but it wasn't great.\n\nI ordered the Japanese Teriyaki Bowl with Mahi Mahi. My friend got the house-special salad. Both were fantastic. We didn't talk much because we were so busy downing our plates. We waited for nearly 20 minutes, but finished our foods in about 7 minutes. It was that good.\n\nOverall, this cute joint reminded me of Hawaii - which I greatly miss. I also think this can be a very fun/solid first-date place. Not too fancy, not too expensive, but just right enough to impress her with foods and decor - at least I'd bring a girl here.\n\nMy friend and I are going to open up one just like this in Washington DC -- only we'll call it Atlantic Catch.", "author": "Josh S."}

Lo and behold, the sign for Pacific Catch even had the the words \"Fish Grill (something of that sort)\" under it. Sold!\nI almost missed the entrance, this place is pretty small! But we got seated at the bar, under the sun roof (AMAZING!) The service was outstanding. The wait staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, the chefs were nice as well. \n\nAppetizer: We were starving by the time we sat down so I immidiately ordered the calimarri. And it was the best calimarri...HANDS DOWN. The batter was so flavorful and the spicy dipping sauce they had was amazing.\n\nMain course: I had a seasonal dish (it's apparently salmon season). I forgot the name of the dish, but it was grilled salmon (i think you already figured that out) with a peach/berry type of.,...slaw? It was really good and the star of the dish. There were also fingerling potatoes. They came in a sauce that kind of smelled like marsala. However, the potatoes were kind of dissapointing. I thought the salmon should've been tastier and the texture for the slaw was a bit strange, due to the raspberries. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the dish, but it wouldn't have been my last supper meal. \n\nI can't speak for my other family members, but they had the fish & chips, shrimp & chimps, and the ahi tuna bowl. They seemed to like their meals.\n\nAnd btw I had their Thai Iced Tea and it was probably the best Thai tea I've had to date. Impressive.\n\nI wish I had room for dessert because I saw that there was mochi fondue!!!

One night, mouth watering for something, anything, and mourning the loss of master, I finally got her to take me there and we got there kind of late. I ordered the Poke Bowl because of the tuna element that lured me, so deceivingly I might add, because it had about as much Tuna in it as a bento box and a mountain of rice underneath. I ate all the tuna, all seven cubes of tuna and left the rice as a statement to the staff that the proportions were far from even and I would not have it. Not for $15.00 anyway. I am a rice factory in my own home, I had cheaper and more proportioned tuna bowl Westfield Shopping Centre. This was unacceptable.\n\nTiffany! and her friend Eli ordered drinks. The bar had to be the slowest because I'm sure my dessert came before their drinks did. \n\nThe dessert was really good though! it was an array of mochi sprinkled with chocolate decadence and powdered sugar. \n\nI gave a good tip for a bad experience which is my very own kiss of death and blatant message that I will never return! call me when my the tuna bowl has either more tuna or has changed their name to rice bowl, then maybe my trust will return. seriously, call me when it happens. my number is 408 489 0750.\n\nlol, I'm kidding.

Scratch that -- before I read the Yelp reviews, I wasn't expecting to like it, based on the look of the Sunset location and on the review of the Sunset location's food given to me by someone I trust. But you Yelpers are right, and I am happily surprised to be able to endorse at least one of the Pacific Catch locations. The place is small, as has been mentioned, and when my brother and I went, it was on a Tuesday night at about 9:15 or so, and it was pretty crowded. \n\nWe started with the calamari and then both had the grilled opah with pineapple chutney, mashed purple potatoes, and spinach. The calamari was nicely fried and came with fried lemon slices, which was an awesome touch. The chipotle aioli that accompanied it was packed with chipotle flavor. The opah was perfectly grilled (tender, flaky) and had a lovely charred flavor. The pineapple chutney was a little sweet, but was well balanced with cilantro and red bell peppers. The spinach was garlicky and tasty, and oh my goodness, those mashed potatoes were almost buttery enough to satisfy Paula Deen. (Almost. But obviously, she'd have added another stick of butter, y'all.) They satisfied *me,* no doubt; it was all I could do not to eat every last bite. But the dish was easily enough for two meals, especially with the starter. \n\nAlso, the service was really friendly. I had a Scoutmob coupon PLUS two gift cards, and the waitress and waiter took those with nary a sour face or curl of the lip. Seriously, folks, that alone is worth a star in my book. I hate when restaurants get bent out of shape when you use a coupon that the restaurant itself agreed to issue. Not so at Pacific Catch! \n\nAnyhoo, stepping off my soapbox now to say, this is a great little seafood joint! I will definitely return for some tasty fish!", "author": "Jessica K."}

Always enjoy the food at Pacific Catch at both locations. A four star restaurant in my eyes!! \n\nWanting to order something other than my usual Japanese Wasabi bowl with Hawaiian poke or seared ahi, I settled on one of the chalkboard specials, a Hawaiian white fish. This flaky, well seasoned and generous portion of fish was exactly what I wanted. Served with brown rice, tomato confit and a grilled artichoke and red peppers and a fresh tarter/aoli type sauce for the fish, the dish was devoured. Though one would think I would have been quite full from the delicious appetizers my dining companion and I ordered. \n\n- Hawaiian poke is always a favorite of mine. Seasoned with just right amount of heat and plenty of the crispy wontons! \n\n- Korean sticky ribs were new on the menu, so were a must try. Fall off the bone tender, sticky sweet and savory goodness! Will order again. Good way to off set all the other seafood we were to consume. \n\n- Calamari is pretty standard, but appreciated the red peppers and spicy aioli as it I always prefer a little heat.

You can't get up without slightly sweeping the table next to you, that means other people's ass right next to your food. \n\nThe food makes everything better. \n\nMy friend got the Sushi Grade Ahi -- seared ahi, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, carrots & sesame seeds with soy-wasabi vinaigrette. How can you not get it after reading the mouth-watering description right? It was so good. The meal-size salad was definitely enough for two girls to share. the sushi grade ahi was tender, soft, and delicious. The dressing they made for the salad was genius too. I hate ginger, I can smell ginger from 20 feet away and I wouldn't go near it. But although this dressing has ginger in it, it was very mild and I didn't mind it as much. \n\nI got their Spicy Ahi -- grilled rare ahi with avocado, tomato & chipotle aioli.\nSO GOOD. The bread was nicely toasted, and the stuff that's in the bread was just phenomenally put together. It was spicy enough to boost your appetite but not so strong that you want a sip of water after each bite. There were two pieces of sandwiches, and I gave my friend the other one since I'm having some of her salad too. We didn't finish the whole salad, oh I forgot to mention there were fries as well.

For once, the food in San Francisco was worth coming back for in the future. It's a muthafreakin' Marina miracle.\n\nThe dining area at Pacific Catch is super small and cramped, but they make up for it with huge flavor and excellent customer service. And even though it is located in the Marina, there was a quite the shortage of guys in pink polo shirts, shorts, and sunglasses. I guess the typical Marina \"bro\" is allergic to seafood? Or maybe they were all out shopping for white baseball caps? Or maybe they were just too hungover to wake up by noon?\n\nThe menu is filled with Asian fusion options. For a starter dish, I highly recommend the Hawaiian Poke. For $8.50, two people can easily share this appetizer that features plenty of large chunks of poke that are bursting with flavor. When La Novia took her first bite, I think her eyes change from green to blue to gray and then back to green. It's that damn good.\n\nAs for the main portion of the lunch, La Novia had a two taco meal ($10.95). For her sides, she chose a \"small side salad & black beans.\" She isn't a fan of black beans and well, she likes her beans as she likes her men: girthy and a lighter shade of brown. \n\nAnyway, the small side salad needed a bit more flavoring; but her taco choices, which included the Grilled Mahi Mahi and the Spicy Chicken, were both very good. I felt the Spicy Chicken could have brought some more heat, but then again, we were in the Marina. However, for your convenience, there are bottles of Sriracha on each table to help spice up your meal (and your bowel movements). Nice.\n\nI also opted for the two taco meal, featuring the Traditional Baja and Crispy Cabo Shrimp. But I opted for sweet potato fries on the side. The fries were okay. As for the tacos, the Crispy Cabo Shrimp taco was amazing, but the Traditional Baja was mediocre and it was \"fishy\" smelling. The smell got all over my fingers. Had La Novia not been at this lunch and I came home from a day at the Marina with hands smelling like this, she would have accused me of having an affair. \n\nEven with the \"so so\" sides and one funky fishy taco, I can totally see myself returning here as it's inexpensive, delicious, and pink polo shirt free.

The baby asparagus pieces were nice and crunchy.  The big stalks of Shanghai bok choy were a bit on the chewy side but were unseasoned so I got the natural taste of the vegetable.  The pineapple salsa which was served icy cold was outstanding bringing together crushed pineapple, chopped red onions and cilantro along with some fiery spices that shot flares up my nostrils.  The salmon was grilled tender and juicy flaky.  I thought it was great that the rice was not soaked in with teriyaki sauce.  There was just enough mixed in to give the dish a nice teriyaki flavor.  I loved how all of the different ingredients with their different flavors blended together so well.  Topped off with sesame seeds I found that the big rice bowl was a challenge just to finish, but I happily consumed every last kernel of chewy brown rice leaving an empty bowl and walking away with a full stomach.\n\nNow I see why this place is so popular!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-22", "description": "I was extremely disappointed after eating here yesterday. After reading so many 4 as 5 star reviews for Pacific Catch and their Wasabi bowls, I dragged my boyfriend here for lunch. \n\nThe location is extremely tiny. I don't know if there are more seats in the back but the front of the restaurant only have 4 tables, with another 4 outside on the sidewalk. \n\nAfter seating ourselves (maybe that's how this place normally is? I'm used to having a server seat us), we decided to order the Miso-glazed yellowtail special and the Ahi Tuna Wasabi bowl, along with a side of spicy fries. Between the time of seating ourselves and ordering, no server came to our table to see how we were doing. In a place that was pretty much 10'x10'. And we were one of 3 tables inside the restaurant. We had to snag menus from a table next to us. Then we had to wave down a server to jot down our order. \n\nThe fries came out pretty quickly. They were nice and crunchy with a little bit too much seasoning for my taste. The yellowtail was tiny and the sauce was too sweet. The mushrooms did nothing to compliment the fish. I felt like I was eating a fish-version of a Chicken Marsala. The Wasabi Bowl was pretty good but I expected a lighter soy-wasabi sauce rather than the thick, mayo-like sauce it came with. Everything in the bowl worked well together overall though. \n\nAnother complaint from me on service though: the waiter, again, never came to check up on us. He, however, did keep chatting it up with the table behind us. The table who had never been there before either. The table who got a refill of chips on their appetizer, along with free samples of another appetizer, when we didn't even get a nod or refill on our waters. Extremely awkward for everyone else in the restaurant. And it's not like we were sitting in a inaccessible area. Our table was the one the servers had to pass by everytime to get to any other table. \n\nAnyways, I won't be coming back anytime soon. Or ever. And if I do, it'll probably be the Richmond location and for a sandwich this time. Overall, HUGE letdown.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Considering it's location in the Marina (and other locations in the Sunset and Corte Madera), it's actually not pretentious or overly trendy. The Marina location is actually pretty small, almost cramped, but it doesn't bother me too much because I've never had a problem getting a table.\n\nThumbs Up: Hawaiian Poke and Spicy Cabo Calamari\nA-Okay: Sweet Potato Fries and Wakame Seaweed Salad\n\nI want to make sure I set expectations. The food isn't mind-blowing by any means, but like I said, the restaurant doesn't try to be some fancy fusion place or foo-foo fast food joint which is what one might expect. First of all, I love poke! Secondly, this restaurant's take on this Hawaiian-style tuna dish was pretty good and failed to disappoint. The Fries and Calamari were pretty good too, but the sweet thai chili sauce was really what made those two dishes even better. Most of all, it's pretty reasonably priced which is probably what makes me want to come back again.", "author": "Jen N."}

We had the Ahi Poke (YUM!), some miso soup, 3 tacos (which came with our choice of fries - sweet potato please!) and baha style mahi mahi. Everything was delicious!

Try the daily catch fish special with sweet potato fries, corn on the cob, etc (fish changes, sides stay the same, usually listed on a chalkboard outside).  The bowls are good too, but for me no \"Wakame\" (wet seaweed) in the Wasabi bowl, although I still want Nori (dry seaweed).  I heard I can get extra edamame instead of wakame which sounds great.\n\nCons: \nAt any busy time the wait can get crazy.  They have done a good job of hiring friendly staff the past couple of years to make the wait more manageable. \n\nFun: \nThere is a surprising amount of alcohol on their menu for a fast/casual place.

The ahi has a lot of sesame oil in it, so if you can handle that, it's all good.  \n\nIf you sit at the counter, you get to watch the kitchen people and the servers maneuver between each other and the small aisle they call the kitchen.

My husband actually picked this place for a group of us to go to after Cal Academy of Sciences, it's very close so perfect. The funny thing is, he HATES seafood and he still recommended it. Which makes it amazing! Ha. He had tacos (steak and shrimp, both VERY good) and I had sushi (my fav, couldn't pass it up.) We also shared the ceviche trio before and it was SO good. The ahi tuna ceviche was the BEST with the shrimp following a close 2nd. \n\nIf you like tequila order a silver cosmo. It's not on the menu but it's made w/silver tequila, agave syrup & lime juice.

I found out about this place from the initial iPhone commercial that was featured last year.  I've been wanting to try out this place and since I was in the city with no busy schedule, I decided to stop in and finally try it out.\n\nUpon going in there, I noticed that it was a small place, fitting maybe around 20 people inside.  I could imagine how busy this place would get.  I got there around 3 pm, which was way after the lunch rush so I was able to get seated with no problem.  The place was decorated nicely and it was in a nice location from what I saw.  \n\nI asked our waiter what their signatures were and he recommended the mahi mahi and the dry rub trout.  My cousin and I were both pretty hungry so we decided to get one of each and split the fish so that we can get a taste of both.  \n\nI tried the trout and was surprised by how fresh it tasted.  Being in SF, I guess they get fresh seafood daily.  The trout was smothered with a dry rub that exentuated the taste.  Also included were fresh vegetables and the great tasting sweet potato fries.  I also tasted the mahi mahi that was complimented with a green tomatillo sauce.  My goodness, that tasted so good.  It really went well with the mahi mahi.  \n\nOverall, I really recommend this place to anyone looking for great seafood.  I looked on the wall and it was voted best seafood in the city of San Francisco in 2006.  The prices are pretty competitve and ranging anywhere from $10-$20.  The specials that I purchased were $18, which  were the upscale platters.  I'm definitely going to hit this place up again next time I visit the Bay.", "author": "Christian M."}

It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall and it's really easy to miss if you're driving on Chestnut, but I definitely recommend it to others and I want to go back.\n\nYes, finding parking is hard, but we luckily found a spot right across the street at the 30-minute meters. Parking Enforcement was out on that Saturday, but so long as you're vigilant you'll be fine in terms of parking.\n\nI tried the Ahi Tuna Taco and it was amazingggg. There was a great sauce in there, and the tuna was fresh, and it was jam packed with great stuff that made for an explosion of flavors in my mouth. Plus, it wasn't tooo spicy and had the perfect amount of kick. I also tried the fish and chips (with sweet potato fries) and while I'm not big on fish and chips.. I LOVED this fish and chips! Highly recommended.\n\nService was super quick - we got our order within 5 minutes of ordering. There's not a lot of seating though, so we waited 10-15 minutes during lunch on a Saturday to sit.

I also had their unfiltered sake for the first time.  It's very sweet and creamy, it was great with the spicy sauces provided with the sweet potato fries.  The portions are generous so don't be intimidated.\n\nKudos out to the bartender/waitress also.

The servers were really nice and welcoming and definitely worked hard to seat our somewhat huge party. Our waiter, Jeffrey, convinced one of my friends to order their baja shrimp ceviche (with a special homemade white sauce -- I forgot what it was). It was absolutely delicious! It had a very nice spicy kick at the end the creaminess of the sauce was a nice touch. \n\nAfter my group and I ordered, Jeffrey gave us a round of free lemonades! So more TIP for him. haha. I ordered the BBQ Salmon (I don't know what bread they used but i LOVED it! it was like focaccia-ish or something), my friends ordered: the spicy mahi-mahi sandwich (which he said was divine because he devoured it instantly), the thai coconut shrimp, traditional baja taco platter, and the fried oysters. I was not a fan of sweet potato fries (I never liked them as a kid) so I opted to have a side dish of the spicy fries. The spicy fries basically is just curly fries covered in tons of spices... VERY GOOD!\n\nMy sandwich was very very scrumptious! The softness of the salmon and the sauce tasted very well with the bread. I loved that there were greens in my sandwich, which gave a bit of a crisp to it. My friends all confessed that their dishes were just as wonderful.

The large chunks of tuna are fresh and buttery, and marinaded with the perfect combination of soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, chopped scallions, and other tasty ingredients.  I can eat this stuff by the spoonfuls, sans rice...sans anything.  And when I found out that Pacific Catch serves Hawaiian Poke, I knew I had to come here.  Even their picture on their website provoked my mouth to water.  And let me tell you, this dish did not disappoint.  It was exactly what I had hoped for.  This $8.50 bowl of ahi tuna cubes was extremely generous and came with crispy wonton wrappers.  Even better, this was a complimentary dish for us with the benefit of the SFExplore card discount (buy 2 entrees, get any appetizer for free).  This is definitely a must-have when you come to Pacific Catch.\n\nTheir other dishes, however, weren't as great as the poke.  The SO had the fish and chips, I had a 2-taco platter and our vegetarian friend had the teriyaki tofu rice bowl.  The fish and chips were not as outstanding as we thought it would be.  Nice and crispy, but kind of bland.  I chose the traditional Baja and grilled mahi-mahi tacos.  They were good too, but not as good as Taylor's!  Our friend really liked his teriyaki bowl, which he substituted white rice for brown rice.  It looked good and he said it was delicious.\n\nThe service was really friendly and helpful.

We found parking just a block away and the wait at Pacific Catch was only 10 minutes, but we were actually seated after waiting 7 minutes.  Our table was the first one by the door, should really just sit two, but a chair was added and was a bit in the way for people going in and out of the restaurant.  After having to move my chair in a few times, we decided to move to the bar/counter.   \n\nI love F I S H (and seafood in general).  I eat FISH raw, pan fried, grilled, seared, deep fried, and baked.  I had the Ahi Poke (Hawaiian Style Sashimi) Wasabi Bowl.  Great, big portion topped with avocado, wakame salad, sprouts, thinly sliced cucumber, pickled ginger, sesame seed, shredded nori and a wasabi-soy sauce.  All over a big bowl of seasoned sushi rice.  It was a perfect lunch (paired with Cricket Cola made with green tea), there was nothing fishy about it.  I can eat FISH with RICE any day of the week and any time of day, that's how much I really love it :-)!\n\nI picked at my friends plate and tried some deep fried oysters (tasty, with a good, light batter) and sweet potato fries (crispy and not too greasy).  Would go back to Pacific Catch to try some of their other dishes that caught my eye while looking over the menu before making my decision including Fish and Chips, Thai Coconut Shrimp and a side order of Grilled Corn with chili-lime butter.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  \n\nMust go back... must go back now :-)!", "author": "Celeste M."}

The wasabi bowl,  specifically, is everything that makes my life worth living all thrown together into one fantastic package.  I usually go with the brown rice (once it hits your lips, it feels so... healthy) and ahi.  Then they throw in some seaweed salad, cucumber, avocado, and this CRAZY good wasabi soy sauce.  It's pretty much all of my favorite foods all smashed together.

The fish was fresh and the chipotle mayo complimented it really well.  I tried some sweet potato fries and thought they were good, but I actually preferred the spicy fries, being a lover of spicy food myself.  The server recommended the Cricket Cola to drink, a combination of cola and green tea, and I thoroughly enjoyed its unique taste.  It also comes in diet, for anyone watching their caloric intake.\n\nMy waitress was incredibly nice--one of my friends insisted she looked like a female version of Colin Firth--and she didn't seem to mind the weird looks we gave her in order to fight for or against this claim.  My only complaint was that one of the other waiters gave us a hard time when the last member of our party hadn't shown up yet, even though they had seated us knowing full well that our party wasn't complete.

There are a few veggie options.\n\nThe food is tasty; the portions are small for what you pay for.  Granted, they have carved themselves a niche in the Marina with their Hawaiian-Asian cuisine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-31", "description": "My present favorite healthy fast food place.  My dirty secret, which I probably shouldn't share on Yelp, is that I've never quite outgrown my kindergartener's dislike of fish.  However, as I've gotten older, my palate has shifted to more grown-ups tastes, and so now while I still tend to eschew cooked fish, I LOVE me some raw fish, particularly ahi.  Not only that, but every time I eat ahi, I feel like I'm on the Perricone diet and s&^t, and maybe I should just eat only blueberries and ahi all the time, and, like, I'm going to wake up the next morning and look 10 years younger while a portrait of me grows older in the garage.  But I digress.  \n\nNot only does Pacific Catch have some fantastic ahi at fantastic prices, they have my other semi-healthy favorite, sweet potato fries.  And man, those sweet potato fries are good...crusty and tasty and mmmmmm.  Honestly, everything on the menu looks mouth-watering, including shrimp and mango tacos, a grilled artichoke appetizer, and the less healthy alternative of fries and any fried article of seafood you can imagine.  Oh, and the creamy wasabi dressing that comes with some of the salads is to die for.\n\nThe space is small and there can be a wait, so impatient bastards like me may want to stick with take-out.  However, the staff alone at Pacific Catch is worth five stars.  Just an extremely cool, low-key group of people that manage to keep it real and keep things moving, but without hustling you out the door.  I think any business owner would be extremely fortunate to have such an outstanding and hardworking staff.\n\nMy only real criticism would be the way that the ahi is cubed...the edges can be a bit ragged, and the pieces a little large and hard to chew due to the slight marbling.  Of course, this could also be due to my tendency to eat like a seagull, which is to say, light on the chewing and high on the gulping.\n\nI look forward to sampling all the tasty (and extremely affordable) treats at Pacific Catch in the future.", "author": "Tanya N."}

This time around, our server was a little flighty. He brought us our appetizer plates way before it was served and disappeared for longer than he should have, which left my dad a little pissy. I peeped him consistently serving a group outside that was seated after us- pouring wine, following up, possibly because they would have \"tipped better\" but who knows, maybe I'm just assuming.\n\nThe Food. This time I came with my parents, who aren't very daring when it comes to raw fish so I didn't order the poke I was eying and played it safe with the calamari for appetizer, which was okay. For our entrees, my parents got the Teriyaki bowl and I got trout + sweet potato fries. My parent's food was pretty good. Mine was okay, but tasted great when I ate my leftovers the next day, which I thought was cool because leftovers can be fun too.\n\nBecause of the wishy washy service we experienced in the beginning of our meal I would have given a lower rating but towards the end of our meal the head chef/manager came out to our section and asked us how we were doing. We were pondering dessert and he suggested the dulce de leche spring rolls, and later he personally delivered them to our table.\n\nHe called them \"deep fried love,\" and I must say, no other way to describe them.

The seating is tight, enough that ten of us had to be split into a table of four and a a table of six, i think we had all the table seating at that point.  everyone else was sitting at the bar facing the kitchen that runs to the back of the restaurant.  by the time i sat down, people were already snacking on \n\nWarm Edamame $3.50\nWith coarse sea salt\n\nwhich i have to say, is the best way to have edamame, with huge chunks of salt that melt beutifully in your mouth.  this was followed by\n\nHawaiian Poke $7.95\nCubes of sushi-grade ahi tuna mixed with red onions, sesame-soy\nmarinade & spicy island seasoning, served with house---made wonton crisps for scooping\n\nDon't be afraid to get your fingers a little oily as you dive tongue first into this huge bowl of fish.  great quality and size for the price.\n\nfollowing that for dinner...\n\nAhi Tuna (Sushi-grade), Grilled Rare  Wasabi Bowl $10.95\nIt comes topped with wakame salad, sliced avocado, daikon sprouts,\ncucumber, pickled ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori & soy-wasabi sauce served over a heaping bowl of seasoned sushi rice.  the amount of ginger could have accompanied an order of sushi for 15 people, but luckily it was all bunched together, not mixed in to the bowl.  the ahi was tasty, still pink in the middle and seared reasonably well.  a good amount of food for the price, and the quality was there to back it up.\n\nI was also able to taste small portions of \n\nGrilled Mahi Mahi Teriyaki Bowl $10.95\nServed with asparagus, glazed shiitake mushrooms, pineapple salsa, grilled bok choy, sesame seeds & house-made sake-teriyaki sauce served over seasoned sushi rice.  the fish so nice they named it twice was a bit overcooked i believe, but the veggies and sauce with the dish were quite palatable.\n\nWhat I liked better than that, and almost as good as my wasabi bowl was\n\nThai Coconut Shrimp $10.95\nSkewered shrimp, dipped in coconut milk batter, coconut flakes &\n5-spice, with sweet potato fries.  Yummy shrimp and my hand got smacked away a few times for stealing too many fries.  so tasty!\n\nThere is only one bathroom in the back of the restaurant and beware staff suddenly coming out a door from the upstairs.\n\nOverall, good food, great price for the marina, if i ever for some reason find myself stuck drinking back in the marina again, you can be sure i'll be feasting at Pacific Catch before i go dance on the tables at the matrix or throw up on my best friend at the bus stop.", "author": "shawn g."}

After quite some tribulations I ended up here to eat alone. This place is a mix of sea-food styles, mostly japanese, traditional (fish & chips), and mexican. They serve fish almost exclusively, but you have your choice of styles. You can get your fish sashimi or sushi style, or you can get fish & chips, or fish tacos, and more!\nCheck out their website, for their menu online.\n\nAnyway I had the fish & chips, which were pretty good. The batter is light and the fish is fried relatively lightly so that they are still \"soft\". In my experience fish & chips is usually fried until the batter is stiff and you sorta have a plank of fish. At Pacific Catch its still soft and requires more effort to hold.\nThe most interesting thing was the choice of fries (normal, sweet potato, or something else that i forgot :(. Sweet Potato fries are AWESOME!\nBeyond the fish and the fries there was some jalapeno tartar sauce which wasnt as good as regular tartar sauce to me (but I like tartar sauce, and most people dont really). The other dipping sauce was some syruppy semi sugary stuff that was a nice alternative, but I would ahve preferred malted vinegar. Finally there was a small dish of some cole slaw, that wasnt bad but nothing special.\n\nAll in all, based on my fish & chips, i'd give this place a passing grade. worth going to, but nothing to go out of your way for. They get points for having interesting styles and combinations, but with some things you just cant do as well as the original. Traditional style fish & chips beats this any day.", "author": "Josh S."}

We'll miss the food, but not the attitude.\n\nMy wife and our 6 year-old daughter and I were in need of lunch recently.  Of course, this popular Marina hot spot was packed, as usual.  We spent several crowded moments being elbowed by passing patrons and staff alike - less stressful for my wife and me than our young daughter - but the host or hostess never came to get our names.  They passed by several times, scowling at us for being in the way, it seemed, though we were following the same procedure we always follow when dining at this former favorite.\n\nAs we stood, waiting, I pointed out three non-adjacent seats at the counter.  We moved towards them and asked a nice couple if they would mind sliding over one seat so we could all sit together.  We sat down and everything was great - a smiling staff member behind the counter (thank God for her!) got us menus and asked if we'd like a drink.\n\nBut just about then an unidentified staff member with attitude brusquely informed us we'd violated company policy by asking another customer to move, and that we were, essentially, very bad, rude and clueless people.  The latter conferred via attitude, not words, of course.\n\nWe apologized, assuring the staff member that the other couple was fine, a statement they quickly corroborated.  We apologized once more and promised never to break this new rule ever again.  \n\nA few minutes later we were approached by another unidentified staff member, who had clearly attended the same charm school.  In no uncertain terms we were informed that our seats were needed for people on the waiting list.  You must understand that, during prior visits, we had taken seats at the counter without putting our names on the list, and had no way of knowing the policy had changed.\n\nWe left feeling saddened by the loss of an old favorite, but instantly agreeing we'd never go back.  Never was there a smile.  Never was there an apology.  In every case, the communication insinuated we were ill-mannered buffoons to assume we could take the action we did.

After my first review the manager contacted me and informed me that he spoke with his staff about the importance of customer service.  I really appreciated that he took the time to contact me and that he valued my experience.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI work in the Marina and am always on the lookout for great lunch spots.  Pacific Catch is a bit of a trek from my work but I decided to try it since a good friend raved about the food.\r\n\r\nI'll admit the food is pretty good ... I had the mahi mahi taco platter ... but the service is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  \r\n\r\nI walked in and no one greeted me.  I waited several minutes for someone to seat me (2 waitresses looked up and saw me) but it was like I was invisible.  I finally asked the girl behind the counter if I should seat myself.  She gave me a confused look and long-winded answer, and in the meantime, a handful of people walked in and took all the available seats.  Then another girl behind the counter turned around and looked at all the tables and blurted out, \"There aren't any seats, you'll have to wait.\"  She didn't offer to take down my name or even speak politely.  So ... I said I'd place the order to go.  \r\n\r\nMy food was ready in about 5 minutes, yet I sat and watched it sit on the counter for 10 minutes.  The 2 waitresses were busy talking to each other and counting how much money they'd made for the day.  I watched them look up at the food on the counter several times and 1 even glanced at me a number of times to see if I was looking, but neither of them made a move to bag and hand me the food.  \r\n\r\nThey finally finished counting the money ... 1 waitress went to take a table's order ... the other ... without washing her hands first ... poured my iced tea and touched all over the tip of the straw, stuck the straw in the drink, then handed it to me.  I thought at any moment she'd hand me my food and I'd be on my way, and I'd toss the straw on my way out ... but she went to the back of the restaurant and never came back.  \r\n\r\nI waited another 5 or so minutes and still no one paid any attention to my food getting cold on the counter.  \r\n\r\nI asked one of the other waiters to check on it and he said he would but ... the waitress overheard and asked me what I had ordered.  (*I must point out that I was the only person who had placed a to-go order the entire time I was there, and, I was the only person not sitting at a table, waiting for food).  \r\n\r\nThe food on the counter was indeed mine and the waitress started to bag it.  I let her know that I'd been watching it sit there for over 15 minutes and instead of apologizing she proceeded to argue with me and tell me I was wrong.  \r\n\r\nThe mahi mahi tasted good but the tacos were barely warm.  The fries were soggy and cold, and my tea was watered down.\r\n\r\nI certainly won't be going back or recommending such treatment to any of my friends or coworkers.", "author": "Miss Purr fec t."}

We started off with the ceviche, which wasn't the best I've ever had, but was worth the money (7.50). For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the ahi poke wasabi bowl. \n\nFish and chips - delicious! Cooked perfectly, tasted fresh, lightly battered, and the sauces it came with were delicious (i believe a tartar and a sweet and sour?). Oh! And the order comes with their sweet potato fries, which are definitely pretty awesome. You can get different portions at different prices; we got four pieces altogether and the price was 12.95. \n\nPoke bowl - also very good! It was a little more than I could finish, so I felt the portions were fairly generous. The poke was set on a bed of rice with what tasted like a wasabi soy sauce? Seaweed salad, avocado slices, some shredded lettuce, and seaweed accompany the fish. You might want to mix up the rice as some of it is just drenched in the sauce while the rest is just plain. Price was decent, 12.95 also. \n\nThe only reason I gave four stars instead of five was the service. We were there on new years day, so of course I felt bad for the servers who had to work the holiday. However, our server didn't check on us once, throughout the entire meal.

The menu seemed to have a bunch of things that looked and sounded great, but were a little disappointing in the taste department. Their ingredients seem to be fresh and of decent quality, but the cooks' need to overcook everything really ruins the texture/taste.

We had a couple of drinks and a rock-n-roll roll to start off with as well.  Our entrees consisted of an Ahi Tuna salad and a miso-type salmon dish.  Both were about average and on par with some other places as far as price is concerned.\n\nThe atmosphere was clean and had a light feel about.  I would have given this place a solid three stars but for our lousy, yes, I said lousy server Tyson.  He had such a miserable disposition that I could hardly believe that he is in this business.  I said immediately to my date that this guy seemed to have a bad attitude.  She thought I might be too quick to judge.  However, by the time our drinks arrived she totally agreed with me and we just were in awe at how long his poor disposition persisted.  He had poor eye contact, was quite rude, didn't write our order down and made errors, Although he did correct his mistakes, he never apologized for them.  Why Tyson acted in this manner, I have no idea.  I tipped 10%, which I think was still too generous given that I felt like the whole meal was a waste of money.  I can cook and make most anything a restaurant can make.  I don't go to a restaurant and spend good money just for the food.  The server represents the business.  In this case this server put Pacific Catch in a poor enough light that this will be my first and last visit here. \nThere are just too many options in this city to return to a place with average food combined with bad service.

My boyfriend and I came on a Friday afternoon for lunch. The inside was cute, but it was freezing (not really a big deal). I ordered the grilled mahi mahi tacos and my boyfriend ordered the coconut shrimp and fish & chips. Our waitress came out with a mahi mahi sandwich, but she quickly brought it back in because I wanted the tacos. When I finally received the tacos, I took a bite, and immediately discovered that the rub on the mahi mahi was kind of yucky... Oh well... I just continued eating, but then I noticed that they left out the avocado, instead of chipotle Crema, they gave me a little drizzle of sour cream AND they never gave me a side of black beans. At this point, I was annoyed and I didn't want it anymore, so I told my boyfriend to try it. He took a couple bites and hated it. So I told her what had been left out and that I didn't like the taco, so she asked me if I wanted a side of avocado.... NO I DON'T!!! ( I didn't yell, I was nice). So she tried giving me the old mahi mahi sandwich ( oh yeah! I want an old soggy sandwich... what a smart girl!) I obviously said no. She asked me if I wanted something else, so I ordered the fried calamari. She asked if my boyfriend wanted the other taco I had left, but he din't, so she took it back with my new order. Then out came the calamari and it was okay ( you can't really mess that up). It would have been better if wasn't swimming in oil, though! EW! \n\nAfter we had finished eating, she came over with the check and didn't say a word..... she had the nerve to charge me for half of my other meal when it didn't even come to me complete!! Instead of complaining, we figured her tip could cover the sneaky little half charge she added on to our check.\n\nAll was not bad...

Keep in mind that my review is based on food that I PICKED UP, however given that they advertise heavy to call and pick up food, I expected a lot more from this hyped joint.  This is from a meal I picked up two nights ago.\n\nFor starters, they completely botched the order.  I ordered the mahi mahi bowl (which is served over rice) and the salmon salad.  They put the salmon in the rice bowl, and vice versa.  The salmon was very good.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed it very much.  The mahi mahi wasn't very good.  For a white fish, it tasted very fishy.  We threw most of it away.  Not to mention I expected smaller cut pieces, not big slabs of mahi.  This is more personal preference.  The salad itself was so-so, the rice bowl pretty tasty.  I liked how they offered an option of brown rice instead of white.\n\nWe also ordered the shrimp ceviche.  This would have been so much better if they offered tuna (or another fish) instead of shrimp.  If you really like shrimp, you'll really like the ceviche.\n\nWhen I came in, I added an order of miso soup - which they charged me  for.  Low and behold, when I got home THEY FORGOT TO ADD THE SOUP.  And every time I tried calling them to inform them of their faux pas, they would just say, \"Fresh Catch Please Hold\" without even giving me a chance to say anything.\n\nIt could be a far more enjoyable experience to dine-in, not sure.  However the experience picking up food was pretty lousy.  Doubt I'll go back.", "author": "Cyrus S."}

Them's strong words. I punched his order into my phone, loaded up google maps and started walking to \"the Marina\" to run our errands.\n\nAbout 8 blocks later I stopped in at Pacific Catch to place the order. The place looked clean, warm and inviting. The waiter that greeted me at the door was totally friendly, as were the cooks standing behind the counter beyond. I gave them our order - two Ahi Dinner Salads with extra fish, and a basket of Sweet 'Tater Fries, and relayed Mike's praise. \"We love our regulars!\" the waiter proclaims. I believe it. They let me know that the order should be ready by the time I'm done shopping around, and call goodbye as I walk out the door.\n\nAbout ten minutes or so later I've got stuff from Walgreens and the Apple Store in hand.

Then we dig into our salads. Mike says, \"Hmm... this isn't as good as it usually is\" and I'm shocked because it's like the BEST SHIT I'VE EATEN IN I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG. Seriously. The tuna is KILLER. The salad dressing is tangy and awesome. There's strips of avocado on the salad, and tomatoes. The lettuce and veggies are crunchy and fresh.\n\nSeriously -- try to eat it sooner than we did if it's your first time and you're unsure.

It smelled so good, in fact, that even though I was standing at the bus stop and the 22 was pulling up, I ran away to find which restaurant was putting out all that deliciousness.\n\nI followed my nose to Pacific Catch and proceeded to order their Hawaiian poke, grilled mahi-mahi fish tacos and sweet potato fries. I LOVED EVERYTHING! Even as a former 5-year resident of San Diego. I went back a few more times that week and tried all sorts of things. The Hawaiian poke is so far my favorite.. it's my girlfriend's favorite too, preferring it even to poke found in Hawaii. Their fried fish tacos aren't as good as the grilled ones, in my opinion. But everything else I've ordered has been superb.\n\nIt's a tradition with my cohort at USF to go and drink/eat after finals. Pacific Catch was the first place I recommended (even though I must've been out of my mind -- its small size is no good for large groups). Everyone loved their food and another classmate of mine got addicted and joined me quite a few more times at PC. His favorite is the salmon teriyaki rice bowl. \n\nWhen my friend's parents from Louisiana came to see the sights in SF, they asked me to take them eat out. Knowing they loved seafood, I took them to Pacific Catch and they raaaaved about it.\n\nI'd give PC 5 stars but the service has been spotty. Twice now they have forgotten to place my order (though each time they ended up not charging me for my delicious meal) and once I was made to wait for no apparent reason. After 10 minutes of standing there, starving, they finally seated my friend and I at a table we'd been eyeing the entire time.

I've gotten the Ahi Tuna Wasabi Bowl a number of times, but I've learned my lesson. I get about halfway through the bowl, and I bonk like it's mile 23 at the SFM. Don't get me wrong, the bowls are delicious and a great value, but I'm not big on taking home raw fish as leftovers, so I've avoided them since that revelation.\n\nInstead, I usually opt for the salad or the Spicy Ahi Tuna sandwich and a side of Sweet Potato Fries. It's hard to go wrong with what you love, and i love TUNA (I feel a rant coming on) and sweet potatoes. The seafood here is quality, so you can be assured that whatever you order will be fresh. The ceviche is good. The last time I went, Ahi Tuna Tacos were a special. NOM. \n\n*WARNING: Tuna tangent ahead*\n--------------------------------------------------\nTuna. I LOVE tuna.

If I could fish with my bare hands like a bear, I would be scooping up tuna out of the ocean and taking bites out of the poor fish like it was a piece of chicken. Dave Chappelle would be on a boat in the distance like an ocean biologist with binoculars and an encyclopedia flipped to Asian Predispositions, saying, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ4B7G8Rw3Q#t=138. Unfortunately, my bare hands are far from bear hands -- oh the irony. I guess having opposable thumbs has its advantages... or do they? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEI6lH1QDSk.

It was early, so we got seated right away.  There's a big menu on the wall and they gave us our own menus as well.  After scanning the menu, I wanted EVERYTHING.  But of course, that wasn't doable.  So, we settled for the following:\n\nHe had - The BBQ Mahi Mahi Salad, the Shitake Miso Soup and the lemongrass ginger iced tea.  I had a bite of it and it was very good.  The salad wasn't overly drenched with dressing and the sweet corn was a great addition to the combo.  The Shitake Miso Soup was amazing.  It came with soft tofu and chopped pieces of asparagus.  The flavor was perfect, not too salty.  And it didn't taste like the kind some restaurants make from a powder package.\n\nI had - The Grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich with sweet potato fries, along with the lemongrass ginger iced tea.  My sandwich was spectacular.  The combination of aioli sauce with the sandwich was perfection.  My sweet potato fries came with a spicy sweet and sour sauce and YES, Keane is right in his review...even Jesus loves these fries!!\n\nWe shared - the Ahi Poke for an appetizer and it brought back memories of Hawaii for me.  Since we sat at the bar, there was a bottle of Sriracha in front of us.  I had a few drops and it made the Poke taste EVEN BETTER, if that's at all possible.  We both scarfed it down in no time.  \n\nAt the end of our meal, I told Adolfo that I want to come back and try everything else on the menu!!!  The service was great as well!", "author": "Selene K."}

After checking out the HOW WEIRD festival, my friend suggested we try their poke bowl. Parking here is a bit of a hassle, so dont come here already hungry and cranky because a line WILL await you once you get to the restaurant. The size is reminiscent of Japanese restaurants you will find in Tokyo, only with a Socal twist to the interior look. There are about 4 tables that each seat 2-3 ppl. and a bar that sits around 8. We decided to sit at the bar where we could see our dinner being prepared. Very awesome selection of food, of course you'll have to start off w/ the sweet potatoe fries w/ wasabi mayo and sweet n sour sauces to dip them. SOOO GOOD! The poke bowl was huge with large chunks of poke to the point I was thinking how will I finish? Great value as well. $11 for a bowl.. and their service was attentive and friendly. I give these girls props for multitasking and taking on the phone-in orders while not forgetting to add the 1/2 sprite to my lemonade.

Overall, the service wasn't that great but its a pretty casual place and they're really busy. Our waiter was awesome. He was totally passionate about the food here and knew how to make our mouths water. I was salivating even before I knew what I wanted to order. He did however disappear for the rest of the meal. Oh well. \n\nI ordered the wasabi bowl with the poke, which sent me into immediate bliss. It had a little bit of everything I wanted! Tuna, avocado, cucumber, seaweed salad, daikon sprouts, lettuce and brown rice. The flavors were great! Mmm... Delish!   We also had the calamari special, which I found out later was completely overpriced. Whoops! The tiny basket of calamari was very yummy but definitely not worth $9. Will stick to the sweet potato fries next time. The grilled asparagus was also great.

Unfortunately for us.\n\nLet's just say Hank's Eats' version of sweet potato fries are dry, and frail looking, like shriveled grape, in string cheese form. Yelp it, they look exactly as you'd see them. I was NOT enthused. SO began my journey to Pacific Catch. \n\nWe started on the corner of Post and Polk, and headed in the direction of the Marina - having been there multiple weekend nights for late-night pizza, I knew exactly where to go. Shouldn't be too hard to find... a half hour goes by, and I've driven from the Fillmore area back towards Golden Gate. Apparently I haven't been to Post St enough times, because I didn't realize it was one street over from Lombard! \n\nHalf hour later, and sweet potato fries in hand, I was ready to go home. Idiot of a woman parks her car on a one way (one-lane) street, going the WRONG direction, so I cave in and have the fries in the car. TOTALLY WORTH IT. I don't dig the wasabi like sauce, OR the eggroll dipping sauce they've given me with the order.

Yes, I was born in California and I don't like avocado... but marinated in the deliciousness of the ceviche, it didn't taste half bad!", "author": "Erin M."}

The Hawaiian Poke appetizer is a must-have although I wish they cut the pieces a little smaller because it was hard to eat on the crackers.  I had the fish tacos and love that you can mix and match them to try a few different kinds.  My friend had the ahi tuna rice bowl, which also looked fantastic and very healthy.  The only drawback is that the place is tiny!  There are 6 tables inside and 3 outside.  So, this is not the place to enjoy a leisurely dinner.  You can see people waiting for the in-demand tables so we felt a bit rushed to get out of there.  I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Shawna M."}

Also included with the calamari were a couple deep fried lemons and tomatoes...nice little surprise that ended up being my favorite (and unexpected) part of the dish. \n\nNext I had the spicy ahi sandwich, which was grilled rare and came with chipotle mayo and avocado on a toasted ciabattaish roll. Came with sweet potato fries and a couple more dipping sauces (wasabi mayo and citrus aioli), all different and very tasty. The boy tried the grilled salmon salad with asparagus and mushrooms, which was also very good.  \n \nIt was a bit surprising that with 3 servers and about 5 tables, the service was slow and disorganized, although the food definitely made up for it. I also heard a much bigger Pacific Catch was opening soon in the Sunset, which will be a nice alternative to the tiny diner-like space of the current PC in the Marina.", "author": "Kelly R."}

I guess that's sort of redundant)\n\nFavorite dish: Poki Wasabi Bowl (hold the ginger)\n\nPositives:\nIf you like ahi tuna, this place has delicious plates that they make with Ahi. There are two great dishes, their Wasabi Ahi Tuna Bowl, which is basically rice on the bottom, with seared ahi tuna sliced on top, ginger, wakame salad, cucumber, and sprouts. Fantastic. The Wasabi Poki Bowl is chopped Tuna Sashimi (cubbed actually) that's marinated in some sort of light wasabi, soy sauce, ginger (actually i have no idea, i'm making this up) sauce but it's by far my favorite dish there.\n\nTheir sweet potato fries are BETTER than Taylor's. That's right. I said it.\n\nTheir wakame salad is good too. Hey, it's wakame salad, if you can't get that right... And it's hard to really tell FANTASTIC wakame salad from just OK ones. But it works, I like it, and I get it all the time.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of fish/shrimp tacos but I do like theirs. I'm not a good enough judge of fish tacos to tell you if its better than other places, but I think they're pretty good. But I'd rather have the wasabi bowls to be honest.\n\nNegatives\nCrowded. Expect a 15-20 minute wait. The place is tiny, and there's not a lot of room to wait, except outside. Also, there's not a ton of leg room when you do eat inside. But it seems like us Friscans are all about the total package. When it comes to a place like this, screw the ambiance, I'm there for tasty food. Ambiance snobbery all you want, but man, I'd eat here anyday. \n\nBTW, one last negative. You can order too much food. Yes, it's tasty.\n\nFinally, don't get the chicken. Dry, tough, not very tasty. Stick with the thing they do best, the fish. \n\nService\n\nDecent. I mean, you don't go there for the service. Or the ambiance. You go there for the food. The service isn't horrible, but its busy so can be hard to get attention sometimes. But then again, its small, so theres only so many places they can run!!!\n\nSummary\nDelicious, it's why its crowded.

Sure there is the occasional binge at say something like Thanksgiving dinner where you eat until you have to cork your mouth shut to keep it all in...those are acceptable days of over endulgement.  Then there are the days where you just feel like you want to spend a little extra big bollah dollah to have a big bollah lunch at work.  That is exactly what mentality I had walking into Pacific Catch and that is exactly what led me to the biggest foodgasm I'd ever had in my young adult life.\n\nI work on Chestnut street so I am within walking distance to this place (Woot, shop at Red Dot! Woot!) Anyways, It was kind of a crazy day, I was stressing big time about some shit that really didnt need to be stressed about, but I just needed to get the hell out for a second.  My friend Amy and I went down the street to try a little Pacific Catch.  I'd never been there before only because their little take out menu gave my wallet a stroke...I could always just go to Taco Bell and get a meal deal and be done with it, but like I said I wanted a little treat and the coconut shrimp sounded right up my alley. \n\nOne minor complaint is that I  think that they should expand their location on Chestnut Street. When you walk in there is a mix of people who have orders to be picked up and people who are waiting to be seated all pressed up against the wall and flowing out onto the street, granted I went there during their lunch rush so I guess that was my fault...I just felt like I was sitting on top of the people who were at tables eating like \" Hey guys, how's it goin? That looks good..\".  My friend and I took a seat at the bar and our waitress came up to us immediately.  She was a manager there and I swear to God she was the sweetest lady, she looked like she owned the place the way she took care of us.  Extremely sweet.\n\nI ordered the Coconut Shrimp and the catch of the day which was Rock Cod if I remember correctly along with a bottomless Thai Iced Tea....HELL YEAH...I said BOTTOMLESS.  For those of you who like Thai Iced Tea but hate the $2.50 a glass shit out there...PC will hook you right up.  My friend got a salad with salmon on it or something, I dont even remember, I was too engulfed in my plate.\n\nThe second I popped that coconut shrimp in my mouth it was like someone turned on a water fountain.  Swear to god my mouth got wet for that shrimp. They popped and were sweet and crunchy and..ugh, holy hell...I might need to hit them back up today...The Rock Cod was exquisite and my Thai Iced Tea kept flowing to wash everything down.  All in all I spent upwards of $40 on lunch.  I just graduated college guys...I don't have that kind of money to spend and you know it was top ramen for the rest of the week for this one splurge, but listen to me...it was SOOOOO WORTH IT!!!!\n\nLittle Tid Bit: The awesome manager lady forgot to bring some brown rice or something for my friend and immediately grabbed it for her and took it off the check...just because she forgot it.  I dont know guys...I think that its really hard to find a place in the city where you can get a crazy awesome meal and have the staff treat you like you're the shit even if you don't own a house in the Marina...or a little yippy dog for that matter.  They made me feel like I was extra special, they made the food quickly and it was THE MOST delicious seafood I had ever had the chance to experience.  If you skip going to this place because of the price or how far out it is then you are really hurting your taste buds more than I think you could possibly ever know.  I couldn't have had better food from the ocean if I stuck my head in there myself.  Christ it was tasty.\n\nBy the way, if you can't get out to the Marina there is another location in the Avenues on 9th and Lincoln.  I haven't tried it there yet but you bet your ass I'm saving up for that, lol.  Good Eating to you all!!", "author": "Sarah L."}

The rice is very tasty and the \"wasabi dressing\" was not super hot, which for me was good,  if you like atomic level heat, they provide ample extra wasabi for you masochists.\n\nThe menu looked pretty good, they have the standard fried fare, and then they have the asian fusion stuff.

I used to like eating at this place cause the food deserves 4 stars and it was conveniently located and it was the few places I can enjoy with my friend's no salt diet.  They most often suck at following directions; lucky for them that the food is quite good that we put up with their lack of capability for following directions like leaving the sauce on the side, which is only followed 50% of the time if that.  I'd give them 1 star for service based on my very last experience there.  I went in to pick up my order and there's 2-3 people ahead of me.  The first took probably 5 minutes to get taken care of.  The second....her order wasn't ready, so the dumb employee(s) decided to stand there and wait for the order to be done instead of trying to ring up the next customer (I could have sworn there was another person in front of me, but don't remember that incident, so I'll just fast forward to me)...so there's another woman behind me who are equally impatient as I am because we KNOW our food are ready and we're STARVING!  We kept poking our head out of the line to show that we're in a hurry to pay and take out food, so instead of helping ME (the one next in line since I can't remember the third person ahead of me...), she rung up the woman behind me instead.  Now I had a connection with the woman behind me in that we're both ready to get our asses out the door, but for her to have the fucking nerves to go get her shit before me....You're a rude f@$%ing B!@#h!!!  No wonder people have so many negative opinions of Marina people (especially of the women)!  You make me feel ashamed to be so happy and proud to live in the Marina for the convenience of my life.  Seriously, I wanted to kick your ass...I can understand that sometimes, servicing to the community when things get crazy busy can be difficult and confusing, but when a customer pointed out to you that she was in line before the person, you [as a good customer service provider should A. apologize for the mistake of helping the other customer first, or B. (the better way) tell that customer that you're sorry for the inconvenience, but you should really help the client in line before her]!  I used to work for Starbucks!  I understand the stress level we can have at times, but you came to the job, it didn't come to you!  Do your job properly for Christ's sake!  \n\nI know that was a crazy rant...I was all over the place, but I'm sure most of you have experienced such poor customer service at one place or another.  I probably don't even make sense, but oh well!  When I'm frustrated about something, it's hard to make sense cause I can't stop rambling...\n\nAnyway, here's my conclusion for the place from last experience I'll ever have there:\n1 star for service\n4 stars for food\n\nFor the overall experiences I had there:\n2.5 stars for customer service\n4 stars for food\n\nAdvice to owner or manager:\nHigher employees who take pride in whatever they do and have common sense.  Ring up people who's food are ready and they're ready to pay, not make them wait because the first person in line's food isn't ready.  Also, ring up the next person in line, not the bitchiest person in line.\n\nSorry about my ranting!", "author": "My Loan J."}

Got to the restaurant at ~7:30pm on a THU night.  Place is super tiny.  There were 4 of us.  We probably waited ~20min for a table.  Wish they could expand.  The food is so good.  We also split the sweet potatoe fries.  The dipping sauce that it comes with is so tasty.  The large was an okay size for the four of us to split the fries.    It's a very casual place.

My cousin eats here every time she visits SF and had given me a gift certificate for Christmas.  Now I was tempted to go to the much more convenient branch in the Sunset, but I decided to stay true to her intentions and try this one--and it paid off, because they're as different as night and day.  While the Sunset PC is one of the largest restaurants in the city, this is one of the smallest, and as such is much more charming.  Furthermore, our 5 PM rainy Sunday arrival allowed us to nab one of the 3 window tables without a wait.  Which pretty much leaves the food--and it was all fantastic, from the crispy oyster appetizer to the succulent trout (the daily special) to the mix-it-yourself cornucopia of the wasabi bowl (I already tried the fries back in the Sunset, but they're delicious too).  And these guys sure do know their aioli.\n\nAll in all, with restaurants like this, you might make a Marina believer out of me yet.

A couple of friends wanted fish and chips, the chips being the delicious sweet potato fries. So, of course we headed towards the Marina having our heart set on fish and chips. We had to wait awhile for a table of 5, I didn't realize how small the restaurant was.  While we were all waiting, of course you have to check out what everyone is eating. Well..... everyone was having either the salad or rice bowl and damn....... that looked so good. So, I had a thought and had to concoct a plan. I figured if I get my bf to order something that I also wanted, then it's a done deal. I get two entrees! So, I ordered the Ahi Poke Wasabi Rice Bowl, but with the brown rice. Ok, ok, I know what you're thinking, brown rice? With Poke? It was damn good. The Poke was fresh and tasty. The Wasabi was not the burn your nose while you eat spicy. The bowl was so good . My mouth is watering as I am typing this. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars, is because of the service. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.

However, knowing San Francisco very well, I knew it wasn't the quickest route. Once there, locating the restaurant was simple, but parking was difficult. After circling for 10 minutes, I found a spot and walked over.\n\nThe restaurant was very crowded. People were overflowing to the sidewalk, either waiting for a table or their to-go orders. From the outside, Pacific Catch was very eye-catching. They had a big sign and nice, vibrant color combinations. Inside, the restaurant kept a simple, yet thoughtful fish theme. Paintings of fish and the sea decorated the walls. In the front were the few tables that people were fighting over. They also had a bar area with stools that were all occupied. I was able to point out 4 people working there.\n\nOnce I entered, I could see why it was so loud over the phone. It was really too crowded and busy to expect anyone to greet me. I found the pick-up area, and waited for 3 minutes until someone asked me if I were picking up food or wanted to order. After telling them I was just picking up, the waiter proceeded to ring up 3 orders before attending to me. The manager came to me and asked if I were being helped before the waiter came back to me with the total cost of my order. Once I paid, the food was already bagged and ready to go. The waiter thanked me for waiting and did not say good bye as he began ringing up the next customer.\n\nI ordered the sweet potato fries and wasabi poke bowl. The fries were excellent. They were battered perfectly, and weren't too oily. In fact, they were still nice and crunchy when I arrived home close to 20 minutes after. They provided 3 dipping sauces, chili sauce, ginger mayo, and jalapeno sauce. All of the sauces tasted good, not too salty or creamy. I was disappointed that the jalapeno sauce wasn't spicy at all. In fact, none of the sauces had any \"kick\" to them at all. The wasabi poke bowl was quite delicious. Although it had too much rice for my liking, everything else was well portioned. The poke pieces weren't cubed too big, perfect for a single bite. The pickled ginger cut the fish taste between bites, and the seaweed salad was not too salty. The only issue I had with the poke bowl was that the wasabi was barely noticeable. I had to double check the receipt to make sure I was given the right order. If you put wasabi in the name of the dish, I think it should be very apparent from the first bite. Overall, it's definitely a must, if only once to see if you like it.", "author": "Axel G."}

I mostly just came back for the hawaiian poke starter and sweet potato fries. Yumm...Im getting hungry thinking about the sweet, crispy little fries. Everything else I tried has been  decent. The fish tacos are okay, but I didnt find anything special about them. The wasabi bowls were a bit too much for me. It's like eating a sushi in a bowl, which was good at first, but a bit too much rice for me in the end. If you have room for dessert, the fried dulce de leche spring rolls was GOOD. Basically a version of deep fried ice cream with caramel. However, what has really stopped me from going back lately is the wait. The place is really small and can get really packed quickly at different times of the day. But you can always order take out, which they do a lot of!", "author": "Kim C."}

And to my pleasant surprise there wasn't so much packed lettuce, but more toppings.  I was very happy.  It's always so packed there, and the food is consistently good.

It's SOOO much better!!\n\n=================\nTerrible. I've gone here once before and had an average dining experience w/ the crab wasabi bowl. Nothing special, just decent filler for the tummy. \n\nBUT, today, we went for lunch and it was the most TERRIBLE dining experience I've had in awhile. So bad, I'm swearing off Pac Catch forever. Oh and we didn't leave a tip and we ALWAYS leave a tip. That's damn bad.\n\nSo we get there mid-afternoon, the place is bustling as expected for Sunday. We get seated after about 10 mins, no biggie. We order our meals and drinks as usual. The place is seriously tiny, it holds maybe 8 people at the counter and maybe 12 more at the small tables in the front. I don't understand why 3 supposedly competent servers can't handle this amount of people. My bf and I were seated next to the counter where the cooks put all the dishes to be served. So I see my dish sitting there for a good 15 minutes and then my bf's dish sitting there for at least 5 mins. I also witnessed 2 servers look at it, ask each other 'whose food is this?'...\"i dunno\"...then our pathetic little server man strolls over finally and looks at it, \"oh it's table 12's\"...That would be us.\nThey put the food on our table and whaddya know, they made the wrong thing for me. Of course. And instead of returning it right away and getting the new dish put through to the cooks, they put it back on the counter and walked away. My bf had his correct dish luckily, except it was supposed to be warm grilled mahi. Since it was sitting out so long on the counter, it wasn't warm. And it was soggy. \n\nAfter sitting another 5 minutes or so staring at my incorrect dish STILL sitting on the counter, my dumb waiter-guy finally saw it again and FINALLY asked the cooks to make the correct meal. So, I figure \"ok, my dish is easy and nothing needs to be cooked, this shouldnt take more than a couple mins\"...so I wait...and wait...increasingly getting more and more pissed off. A wasabi bowl is rice, seaweed, and cold crab salad! good lord. after about 15 more mins, I just get up and tell them to just cancel my portion of the meal. My bf was done eating and I hadn't gotten anything yet! WTF. The guy I told gave me this half-assed \"sorry\" and told our server the news, who then gave me the evil eye, which I gladly returned. \n\nWe then asked for a box and never got it. So we asked another guy, who pulled them from a stack that was right next to us! UGH, I think I woulda been happier if I could have just served myself, at least I would have gotten everything a lot quicker. \n\nNo tip for you a**holes!", "author": "Jen P."}

We saw how it (ribs) were made and were very surprised that the ribs were just thrown in the deep fryer.  We were thinking they were going to be grilled.  There was way too much \"sticky\" sauce on the ribs which made his bowl too salty.  I ordered the poke sampler which came with all three varieties.  I thought it was good but probably wouldn't order it again as a meal.  My sister got the special corn side which was just plain grilled corn and a side of the chipotle butter which was delicious.  There was parmesan, chipotle or some sort of pepper, butter, and some other seasonings in it.  Fattening but good!  And she also got a fish taco and the tortilla soup.  The soup wasn't that good.

Miso soup was cool, tasted like it has everywhere else, and her green tea was eh, but that's how i feel about all green tea...she said it was good though. \nI didn't forget about the calamari.....it just hadn't come out yet. \nMy girl had the seared tuna salad (with \"sushi grade tuna\") and I had the Baja tacos w/ spicy fries and jalapeno crema (catch of the day was my favorite fish...tilapia).  My tacos were mmmmmm mmmmmm, so were the fries and the crema!  I'd definitely order it again.  Her salad was good too, except the tuna was poor quality......a little stringy, ok A LOT stringy.  I didn't want to take another bite after i chewed a wrong piece of tuna.  \nThey brought out the calamari afterwards because they had forgot, but no big deal.....it was real good and i liked the dipping sauce.  \nService was great and i'd definitely rather come here after getting drunk at the bars/clubs than go to fast food.  They even comped the calamari because of the mixup, which was nice but unnecessary....\n\nCome here, but maybe think twice about the seared tuna salad", "author": "Ocee D."}

I went back to Pacific Catch, got seated right away, the fish tacos were out of this world, the service was good, and the server made a gratuitous substitution I totally should have been charged for.  I love this place.  I must of been really cranky the other night...\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nI am so conflicted about this one...  if I was rating this on the food alone I would give it 5 starts.  The wasabi bowl is my perfect meal; your choice of seafood (I went with the California Crab) combined with seaweed, fresh cucumber, sliced pickled ginger, and daikon sprouts all on a bed of sticky rice... perfection.  However, there was a disconnect for me between the hole-in-the wall setting and the prices.  My bowl was $12 which I think is fair based on the quality of the food...  but having to stand outside on a cold windy street FOR FREAKING EVER to wait for a table...  being asked to MOVE after I was seated to accommodate a bigger party, the bad instant ice tea that never got refilled even once during the whole time I was seated, the fast food like service (as in no service beyond taking the order and delivering it to the table)...  I just don't know.  I can think of a dozen other places with $10 - $12 entrees where you can sit down for a civilized meal.  If I was into fish and chips or just wanted a fish taco and there wasn't a wait, this place would be a no brainer because the fish is really good.  And if I lived in the neighborhood it would be a nice take-out option.  So there it is.  By the way, I am not known for my patience.

I can't say I'm that adventurous here: I order the Tuna Poke bowl every single time. I think I ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich one time. While it was great, nothing compares to a Poke Bowl. Big chunks of raw tuna soaked in a hawaiian poke sauce, avocado, sprouts, ginger, wasabi, seaweed salad, and all on top of a bed of rice drizzled in a wasabi sauce. With a little Sriracha squeezed on top of it all, its my favorite meal of all time. Hands down would be my last meal. The sweet potato fries are also great. I had my first experience with them here about three years ago and have been hooked since. There is also a Pacific Catch near Golden Gate Park on 9th and Lincoln. This is a much bigger, restaurant style place. I heavily recommend going to this location off of Chestnut in the Marina instead. It exemplifies everything that is great with San Francisco food.

Our bartender was attentive to our needs and was friendly. :) We had the mixed seafood basket. I loved the shrimp with the coconut flakes on it. It had a mild curry taste and it was so good with the sweet chilli sauce that it came with. Our meal sized ahi salad was wonderfully refreshing and tasty. We cant wait to come back for our next meal. Those two entres were so filling for us that we could not make it to dessert. Maybe next time!\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nOur 2nd visit to Pacific Catch was just as memorable. As before, 5 stars for their stellar customer service. I loved our friendly waitess from that evening :) and the casual cozy atmosphere at Pacific Catch was just great for catching up with family. We had the traditonal baja and grilled mahi mahi tacos and it was fabulous. But if I have to choose one that I like more, it's gotta be the mahi mahi one. We also had the grilled sturgeon and it was so fresh and firm. I loved the sides of the sweet potato fries, cant get enuf of it and dipping it in the spicy saracha sauce. This time, we made it to desserts, we had the Fried Dulce de leche \"Spring Rolls\" ooohhhh....heavenly, there seemed to be some kind of cake like texture inside the springroll and for desserts, warm and cold combinations are always a clear winner.

I decided on the salmon sandwich and salad (rather than the scrumptious looking sweet potato fries as I was trying to be good). The sandwich also came with a cole slaw...not your usual.   Very good.  I will definitely be back.  It is very small at this location so probably better to order take out.  Today was an unseasonably cold SF day...so prob better on a normal weather day I was freezing sitting by the door...but again today was not a normal day.

I got home and was pleasantly surprised.  The bowl was delicious with pineapple salsa on top and tons of chicken...not exactly enough teriyaki sauce (I had to add soy sauce) but still amazing.

The sweet potato fries with the two kinds of dip rule! Oh yeah, the fish tacos, where you can mix and match the main protein, are always a hit. At Lincoln, they have a good variety of drinks, and they make them from scratch with fresh fruit juices and agave sweetener. The drink won't get to you super quick, but it will be worth the wait. Try going during happy hour (4 to 6pm) for price breaks on appetizers -- out of which you can make a meal -- and drinks. They have a second drink-only happy hour that I believe starts at 10:00pm. The service is always friendly. I typically eat at the bar, and occasionally you can be ignored, but that's because they're busy making all those fresh drinks.

I love salad dressing (vinaigrette) but PC made my rice so sweet and ever so salty, I could not lift my spoon for a second scoop, so I handed my food back to the server, and requested my dressing to be put on the side, that way I can dip my sauce to my own desire...\n\nafter their 2nd attempt, I have to say, I managed to eat everything off my bowl, quite tasty, but indeed, too much rice ... everything was def fresh to one's satisfaction ... \n\ngenerous portions indeed! \n\n$11.95 for some super generous ahi poke! I give 4 stars...  Topped with wakame salad, sliced avocado, daikon sprouts, cucumber, pickled ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori & soy-wasabi sauce served over a heaping bowl of seasoned sushi rice.. you get a variety but below are the types of rice bowls you can get...\n\nAhi Tuna $11.95\nAhi Poke $11.95\nGrilled Fresh Salmon $11.95\nCalifornia Crab Salad $13.95\nBBQ Unagi (Japanese Eel) $13.95\n\nA fine selection, don't you think? and an additional $1 for brown rice!\n\nHe got the Spicy ahi sandwich $8.95 (w/avocado, tomato and dab of chipotle mayo. The chipotle mayo def had a great kick to the sandwich) w/a side of potato fries... I'd give 3.5 stars. It was aright ... Nothing too fancy.\n\nShared a yummy appetizer, Thai Coconut Shrimp - Skewered shrimp, dipped in coconut milk batter, coconut flakes & 5-spice, with sweet potato fries $10.95. It was def good but you only got 3, mebe if they gave us 4, then I'd give 5 stars, but whatever...  \n\nOverall, the place is extremely tiny, so you may feel quite claustrophobic ... so prepare for that! Kinda had this wahoo's appeal ...", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Now, my sister and dad were whining about fish and chips since the early afternoon by the beach the (Cliff House?).  But finally gave in!  Glad I did, because they had more than just fish, they had chicken and things.  Got a meal sized chipotle chicken salad.  It was so good!  Normally I don't have a high intensity of hot things, but it was so good I didn't even care.  The inside was neat and clean and had pretty cool decorations and had comfortable seating, employees were dressed nice and clean.  But am knocking a star down because the bathrooms were by a weird place.  My dad and sister got fish and said it was really good, it wasn't greasy or oily like other fish and the fries were good.  The meal sized salad cost 12.50.  They do offer take out too.  It's a nice place to eat/ access if you're visiting the around the gardens.", "author": "Jacqueline R."}

It's Christmas and it's the season to snuggle and eat right next to strangers in the city. My boyfriend and I just came in for a snack. We ordered 2 Sierra Nevadas and the Ahi Poke appetizer. Our server was a little chatty and only too excited about his first ever band performance and how he was still hung over from two days before. On top of that, he said playing loud made up for his lack of skill.  Oh great. All I hoped was that he was no where near the making of my food.  At first glance, the ahi looked wickedly good. Big huge marinated chunks of ahi with won ton strips topped with green onions. Looked good but only so-so. Surprising kind of plain.  I think that it needed more marinade, wasabe...something!

Otherwise the drink selection was good, its cozy, and in a good neighborhood for eating before going out.", "author": "Lenore B."}

Try any of their signature drinks, especially  the Lemongrass mojito which is by far the best mojito I've ever tried. For an appetizer I always go for a basket of their famous sweet potato fries.Yummy! Service is always pretty good. The other day we had a cute russian waitress, who was very friendly and attentive.", "author": "katie m."}

Nothing too fancy, and eating there can be a little crowded, but the food is just plain good.  I'm a big fan of the Ahi Tuna Wasabi bowl.  The appetizers are good, I've found service to be very good, and the price is right.  Becoming one of my neighborhood staples...", "author": "Green T."}

Maybe I haven't tried the right dishes, but I didn't think any of the entrees I had were outstanding. The sweet potato fries are quite good and craveable.", "author": "Varun B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-22", "description": "i really like this place. not only because it's close by my apartment but i'm always happy with my meal. always satisfying. the portions are a little big for me - so i often opt for the kid's size. i'm also a huge fan of corn on the cob so i always get that as well. sweet potato fries are to die for - try dipping them in the spicy sweet sauce - i always ask for extra.", "author": "Miss O."}

The person I went with had the mahi mahi sandwhich and it was delicious! We shared the tuna poke for an appetizer and really, everything tasted so fresh and was presented very aesthitically pleasing! Small place, but great for a quick lunch, with reasonable prices, and staff was very friendly and accomodating. Parking garage is close too.", "author": "Michelle J."}
