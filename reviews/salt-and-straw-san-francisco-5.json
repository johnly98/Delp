I just enjoy seeing how a random blend of \"Chopped\" basket-like ingredients taste sooooo good as ice cream. Olive Oil ice cream? Yes indeed. Dandelion and chocolate, I guess if you like chocolate ice cream. But basically a lot of what sounds like it tastes strange turns out to be delicious, while other flavor combos maybe miss the mark. The nice thing is that you can try any and all flavors without feeling rushed or guilty or feeling the heat of disapproving looks as you take your time. \nSalt n Straw, a small chain, tends to have a crowd inside and out, and the lines moves steadily enough at all the locations I've tried: Portland, Seattle, and now, San Francisco. \nThe ice-cream quality is very nice: creamy, smooth, and full of flavor. It's always a fun and satisfying time here.", "author": "Ruby H."}

Im a sucker for crazy flavors and not only are Salt and Straw's wild and on a monthly rotation, the high quality ingredients are hard to beat. I try to go once a month since once their gone, I know I'd regret never having them. Favorites though from the regulars are their malted cookie dough, lavender honey, and olive oil. \nFor the cookie dough, malted is the key word- almost caramelized brown sugar with a touch of saltiness is a melt-in-your-mouth  and chunky delight.\nThe lavender honey taste like fresh, perfectly balanced lavender honey. It's a simple combination that they got just right.\nAnd last but not least, olive oil. The creamiest ice cream ever. Olive oil, especially when you find a good one like they did, should be added to ice cream. Period.", "author": "Sophia C."}

The first thing I loved, is they give SOOO much for $5 vs. ahem, other ice cream places which give golfball sized scoops for the same price.\n\nI like the boldness and creativity of this place, but for some reason, after a couple of bites of ice cream, the flavors were too overwhelming and I didn't feel like finishing it (I know, the horror).

I definitely wanted to drop buy a S&S here in SF to see what this hype was about before it opened in Anaheim, so I planned this little evening for a little taste test. Being a tourist to SF on this visit, I jumped on the local bus line, dropping me off no more than a block away!\n\nIt's a quaint little store. Loved the fact that they are using steel spoons for sampling, instead of plastic. So that's a plus! The had buckets on the counter for the used spoons, or you could deposit your spoon in the built in spoon slide (just a chute that collects the spoons, lol). They had such a large variety, I almost tried them all! I think the one that stood out for me, although I wasn't sold on it, was the bone marrow and smoked cherry. It was an interesting flavor, but it didn't fancy my palate as I would have liked it to. So, I ended up with the sea salt with caramel ribbons and east bay rocky road. Both great flavors.\n\nSeating is very limited inside the store. If I recall correctly, there's probably comfortable seating for about 10 people. But it's an ice cream shop, who needs to sit in the shop to eat their ice cream? The location of this store opens the opportunity to walk around. There's a great little park down the street I walked to where I enjoyed my ice cream and people watched.", "author": "Antonio L."}

Once was last year a few days before they opened their Fillmore Street location; they had a pop up under the Dome at Westfield and were selling small cups of their ice cream for $5.  I went with the strawberry tres leches which had a nice fresh and creamy strawberry taste.  It started getting a bit too sweet after several bites however.  \n\nI took a trip to their Hayes Street location in June and tried several flavors but none of them really tickled my tastebuds, including their Dandelion chocolate cookies & cream, so I went back to the strawberry tres leches.  On my third time last month, I first sampled two of their specials for the month - a melon and proscuitto and a carrot cake with roasted hazelnut.  The melon and prosciutto was a perfect mix of salty and sweet.  It was refreshing but lacked boldness, dare I say it was very faint.  Next I tried the carrot cake and hazelnut.  This one was a winner!  Is carrot cake healthy?  Lol I guess it's healthier than other cakes but anyways it reminded me of a traditional carrot cake done right - flavorful but not over spiced and without the over sweet cream cheese frosting.  The roasted hazelnuts were a nice touch.  \n\nWhat I like about Salt & Straw is that they have a broad flavor range for the traditionalists to the adventurists. I also like how Salt & Straw uses local vendors' products in some of their flavors such as Dandelion Chocolate, Mount Tam cheese.  But note that Humphrey Slocombe has done some untraditional flavors (they were the first in the area to have pork flavored ice cream).  In terms of taste I still think that Bi-Rites flavors taste a lot better, are more attractive and aren't as painfully sweet.  Bi-Rite also gives bigger scoops at a better price point and they have a punch card reward system!\n\nI'd still go to Salt and Straw if the ice cream craving hits and I was around one of their locations but I wouldn't go out of my way for them.  Suggestions - Bolder flavors with a little less sugar, be a bit more generous with the scoops or at the very least offer a reward system.", "author": "Cat C."}

Some parts of the ice cream were a bit icy, which was disappointing, but overall the ice cream was really good.

I think it took a little over 15 mins to order.\n\nI believe I tried the Strawberry Tres Leches, Old Potrero Rye & Cocoa Nib Sorbet, and Freckled Mint TCHO-colate Chip. I ultimately picked a single scoop of Matcha & Black Raspberry on a waffle cone. (From my pic of the menu, the scoop was $5 and the cone was $1.25, so my dessert was $6.25.) The ice cream was rich and creamy with a nice balance of flavors. The berry added a bit of texture and a subtle sweet tartness to the matcha.

I was here on vacation and as noted by many of my friends, the West Coast has some of the most innovative foods. My experience at Salt & Straw is and will be unforgettable (I apologize in advance if this sounds a bit much). \n\nThe reasons are as follows: \n1) Flavour - I came during their vegetables-infused series and got Beet Red Velvet and Carrot Cake Batter and Pralines Hazelnuts. I also got two flavours off of their classic menu - Organic Roots Arbquina Olive Oil and Breakaway Matcha and Black Raspberry. I recall watching hours of baking competitions and one common critique amongst the judges would be the absence of a stated flavour. At Salt & Straw, I was able to taste every flavour that was listed. \n\n2) Size - If you don't have a bottomless pit like me, you might have difficulty finishing these. Though I originally got these to share among 4 people, I ended up loving the ice-cream so much and devoured all of them. \n\n3) Locally sourced - MAY be sustainable in some aspects but... warning: I'm an advocate for sustainability and ethics - not sure to what magnitude this helps out the local economy...\n\nBut politics aside - this is one of the greatest ice-cream shops I've ever been to!", "author": "Sharon T."}

Let me remind you that I'm allergic to milk - especially heavy cream which is used to make ice cream - and I still frequent ice cream shops. I just try to stick to the vegan/sorbet options. And I really love Salt & Straw because they let you taste everything, in fact they insist you try more when you only give them a few flavors to try, so I always sample more. Sure, I might get a little stomach ache for those little tasters, but that's not their fault!! They have so many options to choose from and their ice cream flavors are very specific to the neighborhood and city they reside in, which I appreciate. Nowhere else will you find a Mt Tam Cheese with Toasted Acme Bread flavor (and yes, it tastes exactly like Toast and Cheese). \n\nAfter trying 5-6 flavors, many of them being vegan, I ordered the Dandelion Chocolate Hazelnut Cookies and Cream (v/gf) + the Carrot Came Batter and they were great. Single scoops are unfortunately $5 which is a lot of money for a single scoop of ice cream BUT if you get the split for .50 cents more, you get to order 2 flavors and essentially get 2 single scoops for $5.50.

Talk about superb customer service.\n\nMy friend and I had swung by on a hot Friday afternoon in June to satiate our sweet teeth. As I've mentioned in my other Salt & Straw review, the best way to get 4 scoops for less than $10 is to order a double scoop (2 full scoops for $7) and split scoop it (turns those 2 full scoops into 4 kid scoops for an extra $0.50 per full scoop). $8 for four amazing flavors, and Dylan knew exactly what I was looking for.\n\nSalt & Straw was featuring a Guest Chef Collaboration Series in June with limited edition flavors from 5 famed chefs. Dylan was kind enough to give us generous samples of each flavor, so much so that we almost didn't have enough room for our actual paid ice cream! He also eloquently broke down the flavor dimension in a manner worthy of Michelin-starred restaurant menus. The flavors themselves were as complex as their descriptions, and, honestly, my palate was too overwhelmed to enjoy any of the limited edition flavors.\n\n-Duck crackling with cherry preserves: very salty (due to the crackling) and rich (due to the duck fat).\n-Tokyo PB&J: tastes crazy similar to Shelly Senbei rice crackers, but a bit too sweet.\n-Ras el hanout (spice mix) and pickled rose petal jam: too many conflicting flavors.\n-Roasted beets and Humboldt fog: very smoky.\n-Jeweled brown butter rice gelato: I can't remember why I wasn't a fan of this one.\n\nWe then sampled a bunch of classic flavors, and I decided on Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate with its subtle bitter notes to offset the silky sweetness from Roasted Strawberry Coconut. My friend opted for the Salted Malted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (love those dough bits) and the Tokyo PB&J from the featured flavors. Dylan then proceeded to pile four generous scoops on top of each other, to the amazement of guests around us. We topped off our tower with a complimentary sugar cone and walked out the door ready to brave the summer heat.\n\nThey rotate featured flavors every month--per their website, it looks like berries are their theme for July (and how appropriately so!).

Also the fact that you can try all of that without having to commit is great. But here's my one major gripe with salt & straw along with all the other places like this that are emerging. Where are the normal flavors?  We get it, you guys are super creative and can make ice cream out of cold pressed hay juice. But when my 4 year old can't find one single ice cream flavor she's comfortable with then maybe we need to dial back the Strawberry Tres Leches flavor to just Strawberry.", "author": "Marcus K."}

I love that S&S has tons of unique flavors. Though you'll likely find yourself waiting in line, it buys you time to go back and forth between the two flavors you want. I'll solve your dilemma... just get both.\n\nFor me, it was all about the carrot cake, which was on the list of special flavors. I love carrot cake, and thinking about that in the form of ice cream was heavenly. I got a single, large scoop of it, and I appreciated the texture of the mix-ins, reminiscent of actual carrot cake. Oh and they have vegan options for those who can't consume dairy.\n\nI hope S&S stays open for awhile. There's so many great eateries and bars in Hayes Valley.

In a recent installment, a lady calls in because her date ghosted on her after their first date. She thought they hit it off because they even held hands. Awwwww...\n\nSandy and Marcus (the radio hosts) call her date to see why he hasn't contacted her for a second date. \n\nSo...apparently, she arrived drunk to the date. \n\nWhile they were walking, he was scared she was going to fall so he held her hand. When they sat down on a bench, she whipped out her vodka bottles from her bag - yes, plural!\n\nDamn, girl...you're a mobile happy hour!\n\nI feel for the guy because I've gone a date with a guy who came blasted to dinner and it was so embarrassing.  \n\nMay I suggest a short ice cream date in the afternoon as a first date?\n\nIf so, I highly recommend Salt & Straw! \n\nThis location has a lot of cute shops and Patricia Green (park) that you can stroll through afterwards.\n\nSan Francisco has tons of great ice cream shops but Salt & Straw is my absolute favorite new skool, hipster ice cream shop. Here's why:\n\n(1) Crazy, unique one of a kind flavors. Each city has their own specialty \"classic\" flavors like Honey Lavender, Berkeley Olive Grove Olive Oil, Chocolate Gooey Brownie, Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches, etc. AND, each month they roll out a handful of special flavors of the month. \n\nFor June, they have a collab with award winning chefs:\n*Duck Crackling with Cherry Preserves with Duck Fat Ice Cream & Honey Gastrique (Chef Traci Des Jardins of Jardiniere, San Francisco)\n\n*Toyko PB&J with Japanese Whiskey-Spiked Strawberry Jam, Peanut Butter & Caramelized White Chocolate Feuilletine (Chef Gabriel Rucker of Le Pigeon, Portland)\n\n*Ras el Hanout & Pickled Rose Petal Jam (Chef Renee Erickson of The Walrus and The Carpenter, Seattle)\n\n*Roasted Beets & Humboldt Fog with Apple-Beet Jam & Candied Walnuts (Chef Brian Malarkey of Herb & Wood, San Diego)\n\n*Jeweled Brown Butter Rice Gelato with Pumpkin Seed Caramel & Verjus-Cured Currants (Chefs Sara Kramer & Sarah Hymanson of Kismet, Los Angeles)\n\n(2) I know some of their flavors sound hella over the top but the combos work! All the flavors I've sampled have a fantastic creamy texture with well-balanced flavors. \n\nMy favorite classic flavors are Double-Fold Vanilla and Peach Vinegar Cobbler (which is not available right now - *cries*).\n\nThis time, I tried their June chef collab flavors -  Roasted Beets & Humboldt Fog w/ apple-beet jam & candied walnuts and Duck Cracklings & Cherry Preserves w/ duck fat ice cream & honey gastrique (small split scoop + waffle cone $6.75): https://bit.ly/2kNtOAS.\n\nI love savory sweet combos so my favorite between the two was the roasted beets and goat cheese - refreshing with a nice tangy funk and good crunch from the walnuts. \n\nIf you've had their bone marrow w/ cherry preserves (a special flavor last year), then you will like the duck fat ice cream. It's rich and savory with a light sweetness from the honey. And, the best part is the duck cracklings brittle. Fat = flavor! \n\n(3) High-quality, locally sourced ingredients. This Portland based company has built relationships with local purveyors and purchase as many locally sourced ingredients (e.g. Sightglass Coffee, Dandelion Chocolate, and Humboldt Fog) as they can to use in their ice cream. \n\n(4) Fantastic owners and staff. When I visited their Pac Heights location on opening day, the owners, Kim and Tyler took the time to greet EVERY single person standing in line to thank them for coming, explained their flavors, and handed out their favorite sea salt caramels from Portland. They started out as a little hand pushed ice cream cart at a Portland street corner so it's great to see as they expand, how humble and appreciative they are of their customers.  \n\nI've had nothing but positive experiences at their shops. The staff is always friendly and more than happy to provide free samples. Be mindful of the line though.\n\nSorry, I didn't get his name but the young Asian guy working on Friday, June 1st at 2:15 pm was AWESOME. Super enthusiastic guy who kindly went through all their new chef collab flavors with us. He also took the time to ask if we had food allergies before the sampling began (there was no line at the time).\n\n(5) Giving back to the community. For their special collabs, they give about 50% of profits to charities: https://portlandfoodanddrink.com/salt-straw-walks-talk/. For their June chef collab flavors, the proceeds are going to No Kid Hungry.  \n\nA location in Burlingame and Palo Alto are in the works which is super exciting as I haven't found a good ice cream shop there. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a low commitment first date, head to Salt & Straw (expect long lines on the weekends) but if your date is an alkie...may want to steer clear of the Tokyo PB&J with Japanese whiskey spiked strawberry jam.

We failed to notice all of the special berry flavors they were serving, which was a bit of a blessing since it would have just made it more difficult to choose flavors. \n\nMy favorite was the Sea Salt and Caramel. the balance of flavors was superb. The Cookie Dough didn't really stand out, but it still tasted good. The Lavender Honey had a very strong flavor, which was amazing for those who like lavender.

We found parking only a few blocks away, so I was feeling pretty fortunate, since it was a Saturday afternoon.  As I stood in line, it gave me an opportunity to look over the menu, since I saw several flavors that grabbed my interest.  Once I got to the counter, I sampled a couple of flavors and knew right away what I wanted.  I ordered a single split scoop, which allows you to get two non-full scoops, which I think is a great bonus.  Plus, we had just come from devouring a big lunch, so I wasn't as hungry as I normally would be.\n\nI ordered the Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate.  I really like Sightglass espresso and it pairs really well with Dandelion Chocolate, so that was an easy choice.  For my other scoop, I opted for the Sarsaparilla & Dandelion Root Beer Float.  Notice, how I was able to get two scoops of ice cream with Dandelion Chocolate at the same time?  Yea, like that wasn't intentional.  The Sightglass Coffee had the perfect amount of coffee and chocolate flavor.  It wasn't watered-down like some coffee ice cream can be.  The Sarsaparilla wasn't overpowering and had just the right amount of Root Beer flavor.  \n\nI love their originality and creativity of their ice cream flavors.  There were multiple flavors I was interested in, so I guess that means I'll just have to go back.  \n\nThe line moved fairly quickly and the staff was awesome.  They were friendly and helpful and let me sample whatever my heart desired.

To be honest I was scared to try them, but all the flavors worked really well and tasted great!\n\nSo far, I've tried their Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches, Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Toasted Nutmeg, Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate, Salted Honey Marshmallow & Walnuts, Food Runners Banana Bread Pudding, Spiced Goat Cheese & Pumpkin Pie, and their Gingerbread Cookie Dough. Out of those, my absolute favorite is the Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate and the Gingerbread Cookie Dough (seasonal)!\n\nOverall, I'm happy that Salt & Straw has moved into the city.

You can ask them to give you a small sample spoon of any of the ice creams. It helps to have a sample before purchasing. I tried two of the Halloween flavors and called it quits, so I'm glad for the sampling. Otherwise, I'd have tossed my ice cream.\n\nInterior is very clean. I like their decor, warm brown colors.

I'm ALWAYS excited to try new ice cream shops and new flavors. \n\nThis Salt and Straw location is located on Hayes Street in the Hayes Valley area of San Francisco. This is the downtown area of Hayes Valley where all the shops and restaurants are. It's convenient if you're in the area to do some shopping. There's plenty of street parking if you drive around for a while. \n\nI've been to the first location on Fillmore Street by Japantown a couple of times. I would say that this shop compared to that one is bigger. The space is wider so it doesn't feel as crowded. The setup of the queue is just as weird as the other shop though. If all the customers queue up from the left side of the entrance and all the customers who are done with their transactions are on the left side of that line, how easily can they leave if there's all these customers standing there blocking them from exiting? Wouldn't it just be better to have customers queue up outside from the right side instead? However the line does move pretty fast and they have a bunch of employees working inside to help expedite. \n\nThey have a variety of interesting flavors on their menu and also seasonal ones which they switch every few months. When I was there, they had a bunch of Halloween flavors which sounded cool, but I wasn't that interesting in those. It's also great that they source their ingredients locally. I got myself a single scoop of Sightglass Coffee and Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate in a waffle cone. The flavor was creamy and decadent. The coffee flavor mixed with the chocolate was like eating an Iced Mocha if you can imagine. I would definitely get that flavor again. Also, the single scoop size is actually pretty large; imagine a tennis ball if you will. The kid's size is a little bigger than a golf ball. \n\nIn San Francisco.....Mr & Mrs Miscellaneous, Coletta Gelato, and Humphrey Slocombe will still remain the top 3 in my heart.

After tasting it, I was hooked and would highly recommend this flavor - it was a little more on the lighter side on my opinion. \n\nAnd PS - one scoop will definitely be enough ice cream for you!", "author": "Tiffany T."}

Tried Jeni's & McConnell's in LA but decided to save the ice cream Mecca of the west coast for last. I got up at 7:30 in the morning and went on an urban hike throughout the city thinking about how good this ice cream would taste. Racking up the steps hiking up those damn hills so I could open up the calorie bank for this indulgence.\n\n6pm I have arrived. I'm overwhelmed with options but luckily I did my research beforehand. I sampled the carrot cake, cheesey shit, olive oil, and a bunch of other off-the-wall flavors. Y'all....this was like the la croix of ice cream. I literally could not taste the flavor I was supposed to be tasting. Were my taste buds broken? The flavor was ridiculously faint in every sample I got. I was the most disappointed in the olive oil flavor. I only settled on the dandelion hazelnut chocolate cookies & cream + salted malted chocolate chip cookie dough because they were the best out of like, 7 flavor samples and I didn't want to walk out after the accommodating ice cream girl let me try so many.\n\nI'm not upset that I tried it, but I am sad that what I discovered was overhyped nonsense :(", "author": "Anna N."}

I first discovered Salt & Straw when I visited Portland and when I found out that they had a location in San Francisco, I was ecstatic! I've been to this location a handful of times now and I've never been disappointed. Though you might have to wait in line for 20 minutes or so, it's totally worth it. The service here is incredible and you should not be shy about asking for samples of their flavors. It doesn't make a sense for me to list my favorite seasonal favorites because it probably won't be available when you read my review, but rest assured, there's so much variety at Salt & Straw, there's something for everyone's palette.

I've been to this one and the LA one now, but still have yet to go in Portland  but WOW. So fresh, and I love how they use local ingredients. I sampled 4 different flavors, which included a matcha with black raspberry, strawberry with some kind of cake, carrot cake, and San Francisco's Owen vegan Dandelion Chocolate with Oreos and made from coconut milk. It was hard to decide because they were all so delicious, but the strawberry stuck out to me because I loved the little pieces of cake inside and the flavor of the fruit was so fresh. I honestly could've stayed there trying flavors much longer, especially as they're really kind and have unlimited samples, but I felt bad for the people waiting behind me, because I knew they were probably just as excited as me to get my ice cream! Next time I'll definitely try more. They even have flavors with vegetables in them, as I'm sure they're still amazing. We had to wait about 10 minutes, so it wasn't too bad, and despite the steep price, it's definitely worth it. There's Smitten across the street, which is good and fresh, but only if you're into the liquid nitrogen hype  wish there was a Salt and Straw closer to come, but it's probably for the best that it's far away or I'd be there all the time!

I tried a few including the gooey brownie, tres leches strawberry and a dark cocoa that had a smoky component. They were are good and represented well with their flavor profiles. One of my barometers for the best ice cream shops are fresh waffle cones and I can say Salt & Straw has a delicious waffle cone. Of course I'm greedy so I adorned it with two large scoops and my taste buds/stomach thoroughly thanked me for that decision.

So although I don't think they need another review validating the quality and overall deliciousness of their flavors I feel compelled to praise my thanks!  \n\nWhen I moved out to the Bay Area a couple years ago, I made it a point to try all of the ice cream shops in SF.  And there are an ample amount to get through!  I had been to at least ten spots when S&S opened up on Fillmore and since the day I first sampled their Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches I was hooked and have suspended my ice cream tour.  I completed the mission and found the very best at S&S.\n\nIt's rare for me to spend a day in the city without a perfectly rounded scoop.  Sometimes I even commute into the city solely for the purpose of obtaining some heavenly ice cream or sampling the newest seasonal flavors!  The staff is always extremely friendly and always willing to provide as many samples as it takes to pick the perfect flavor.  I have stood in many a line outside of their shops and I have never felt that it wasn't well worth my time.\n\nRecently, I got engaged and convinced my fiance to take some of our engagement photos with ice cream, and, of course, it had to be S&S.  We want to say a special thank you to the manager, Skyla, for hooking us up with the most beautiful double scoop that served as a fun and delicious prop for our pics.  Thank you,  Skyla!! So glad to make S&S a part of our engagement memories forever:)\n\nPro tip: sample your heart out, then go with Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches because it IS the best.

You feel the butter in your mouth after every spoon as a solid form which is not good. Too sweet. Way more sweet than an ice cream is supposed to be. \nGot the strawberry and tres leches, salted caramel, and orange blossom. Salted caramel was something other than ice cream cuz it was super salty, sweet and salt was not well balanced couldn't finish it. No tiene sabor!!", "author": "Zeynep D."}

If you're traditional flavor ice cream type this might not be a place for you. I will say the sweet potato with maple ice cream was pretty good. The ice cream is creamy but not too rich.

I am a poor victim of this craze for the past few years, but Salt & Straw now in Hayes Valley? It's dangerous. Coming here on a Saturday night after getting food and drinks can only mean delicious ice cream. \n\nICE CREAM: Strawberry Tres Leches as the classic. Oh god. I had to get a pint to take home that I held from my Lyft ride back to East Bay. T'was worth the journey. The creaminess, the layers, and the strong strawberry jam in the ice cream were amazing. Also, got the seasonal Thanksgiving ones this time (Turkey flavor anybody?) that were pretty impressive this time.

Two benches outside and very little indoor seating, they are mainly geared for take-away. If you just want a pint, just grab from the mini freezer and pay (don't have to wait in the scooping line).\n\nI love how they use local ingredients and aren't afraid to try unique combinations. I tried them 1st in Portland and very excited they now have 2 locations in SF. I think I've been to all their Portland and Los Angeles locations as well! And they aren't stingy with their sampling like many ice cream shops! You don't feel rushed and the employees are very helpful.\n\nWarning: one scoop = size of tennis ball. If you can't eat that much but want 2 flavors, ask for a split scoop.\n\nSampled this trip:\nSalt Honey Marshmallow was more salty than sweet. Loved the Sightglass Coffee & Dandelion Chocolate flavor (two of my favorite things together!). The Strawberry Tres Leches was overly sweet to me.\n\nNow the Halloween flavors. My favorite was the Dracula's Blood Pudding (which does contains pigs blood) but one person I think best described it as a spiced hot cocoa flavor. The Great Candycopia was extremely sweet  (as expected) but I like the different textures. Creepy Crawly Critters does have chocolate covered insects (which you can buy a bag of in their store) that kinda reminded me of small chocolate covered rice crispies. The Freckle Hyde Potion is slightly bitter since it does have bittermelon. The Essence of Ghost was a fairly light sorbet.\n\nMy usual go-to flavor is the honey lavender if you want a safer flavor choice.\n\nOh and the waffle cones DO taste as good as they smell, so I HIGHLY recommend it!", "author": "Kitty K."}

Usually, I'm not a fan of strawberry flavored things, but it did not have any hint of artificial strawberry and had a good balance of both strawberry and tres leches flavors.

Carrot cake was my favorite featuring a strong molasses taste. Next best was the Melon & Capicola - I've never had a meat in an ice cream!

I didn't realized that this was a \"newer\" location that recently opened because I couldn't remember where their SF location was (after looking it up, it's at Fillmore & Sacramento) that had opened several months ago.  So they have more than one location in SF now!  Never mind that it's the first day it's felt like fall to me this year, I'll still have ice cream!  The line wasn't bad...service was really friendly, & I got to try several flavors before I decided.  I ended up getting Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate (yup, they locally source their ingredients) and Honey Lavender (which could've also been Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches,Olive Oil & Lemon Custard, & I had a hard time deciding).  I decided to split my \"single\" size serving into 2 flavors--yes, there is a charge for that.  I debated getting a waffle cone, but eventually decided on a cup.  Yummm!!!  We were lucky enough to snag some of the limited seating inside to enjoy our ice cream (my friend was dressed more for summer weather, so was happy that we got seating inside).  So, I had a great experience at my first visit at a Salt & Straw outside of Portland.  Now I don't have to travel to Portland to visit Salt & Straw, & I even have 2 locations to choose from in SF!  \n\nOh yeah, they had special Halloween themed flavors for October, but I didn't try any of them. \n \nLocated on the north side of Hayes just east of Laguna.", "author": "Linda T."}

A flight is only $11 bucks, which is pretty reasonable when you split it between two people and you get to try 4 flavors! I chose Roasted Strawberry Tres Leche and Chocolate Gooey Brownie while my friend chose NeoCocoa's Black Sesame Brittle and Brown Sugar and Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons. \nI think the Sesame brittle is definitely an acquired taste, I wasn't a huge fan of it but my friend liked it since she liked sesame flavor. The Sea Salt was a little too salty for me but I liked it better than the sesame.\nI originally liked the Strawberry Tres Leche one the best, until I got to the bottom and saw that it had pieces of cake in there, which actually detracted from the overall dessert. I loved the ice cream portion though. The Chocolate gooey brownie was just a classic and I loved it overall the most because it was exactly what you think it to be. I'd definitely like to try new flavors in the future!! \nService was nice and friendly and the looking of the place was pretty chic, I just wish there had been more seating available.", "author": "Payal P."}

I have an actual wheat allergy and willingly suffer for their roasted strawberry tres leche ice cream. So Benedryl in hand I enjoy their delicious flavors, especially their rotating holiday flavors. The lines are always long but that's because each customer is patiently allowed to try a sample of each and every flavor they want to try without being rushed or given attitude. The staff at each location is always happy, friendly, informative and if you have other allergies they ask to make sure you don't die. Always a plus with good customer service. I usually try a ice cream flight when there's a bunch of flavors to try which is $11 but sooooo worth it. If you're an ice cream person this is a must try and currently all the locations are in San Francisco hopefully they'll put more along the peninsula !! Hint hint!

Salt & Straw is by far the best ice cream that has ever existed in the history of anything. They get an A+ from me for three reasons. First, their flavors are unique and always stellar (even the ones on the weirder end of the spectrum). Second, they take the time to make sure your experience in the line is worth the wait. They are patient with each of their customers in helping them decide exactly which flavors work best for them.

They're the same ones as in Portland's Hawthorne location, which I went to earlier this month. The candycopia flavor is especially sweet because of the butterscotch flavor, but it does use housemade chocolate candies like their version of the whopper. I also tried the essence of ghost, which had a faint scotch aftertaste. This month, they also have a creepy crawly flavor which is a matcha green tea ice cream with crickets and mealworms. Because the ice cream is so sweet, it wasn't so bad, but the bugs are definitely noticeable after the ice cream melts away in your mouth and you still have crunchy bits stuck in your teeth... In the end, I opted for some classic flavors like the coffee & choco (San Francisco's Sightglass & Dandelion instead of Stumptown & Woodblock) and honey lavender.

To my surprise there was no line so I was served immediately (I did create a line though because I wad holding things up by sampling - sorry!). I initially tried the pumpkin goat cheese which tasted like cheesecake, and then sampled the coffee and knew I needed an entire cone of just that. It was delicious. Perfect texture, amazing flavor, very interesting (in a good way) and just perfect. The cone was the icing on the cake because it was fresh and the flavor was on point. What else can I say?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-14", "description": "Alright, I don't often Yelp anymore, but I decided to do one for S&S considering how much ice cream I buy here. I'm from the South Bay and make a monthly, sometimes twice a month, trip to visit my friend and we go to Salt & Straw. I used to buy at the location on Fillmore, but have since started buying at this location because it doesn't feel as crowded. Anyway, back to the ice cream, I've definitely spent hundreds of dollars buying pints here ($11 each). I make it a habit of bringing my freezer bag (though one time I forgot it and bought a Salt & Straw bag), and stocking up for the month. Each month they roll out five new monthly flavors and I am obligated to buy a pint each time and see if I like it. That comes out to $55 at least, not including the SF exclusive flavors that they have. \n\nBe warned, not all the flavors are winners, but I'm sure they tested and tasted each flavor and it appealed to enough people to warrant being in their freezers. For instance, in January their monthly flavors were all vegan ice creams. Not my cup of tea, but there are people out there looking for quality vegan ice cream. Also, where else can you find a place bold enough to make grass flavored ice cream with bugs in it or ice cream with salted turkey skin brittle? When they do get the flavors right though, it's a homerun, touchdown, three-pointer (and one), and a one-timer all-in-one. A great example of this is The Great Candycopia, one of their October flavors. They diced up homemade candy bars and mixed it into salted butterscotch ice cream. That flavor was so good I bought three pints of it. Their everyday flavors are fantastic too, and I highly suggest you try their Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache & their Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches. Sometimes they'll have new flavors without announcing them, like this Goat Cheese with Black Olive Brittle flavor that was delicious. Unfortunately, they did not have any pints available, only scoops. \n\nOutside of the ice cream, every time I've gone to this location or the Fillmore St. location, the employees have been extremely friendly and accommodating. If there's a line, but you've got the time, it's worth it to wait and taste the different flavors. You can taste as many as you want before making your final decision. The employees also have great input when it comes to the flavors, so feel free to ask them what their favorites are. If you're only buying pints, you can skip the line, grab your pints from the freezer, and head to the cashier. \n\nOverall, great place with great people and ice cream flavors you won't find anywhere else.", "author": "Stephen N."}

Not only is the ice cream great and extremely rich, but everything about the company, the space/set up and the employees just left such a great impression me and will to you too! Seriously, the space is a little on the smaller side but it works perfectly. And the circuit they create is a very effective way of getting in and getting out with your ice cream in the smoothest way possible! Even the location of the shop is in a nice neighborhood with the park right next to the shop so you could do what I did which is get your ice cream and go to the park to enjoy it!\n\nAnd can we talk about the workers? Salt & Straw does a tremendous job in taking the time to really train their workers in exactly what makes their ice cream and their company stand above the rest. This very helpful women named Jaden helped me decide on what ice cream I could get by letting me know about how Salt & Straw gives unlimited samples. Usually with places that give samples, I feel nervous about asking for too many samples because I don't want to take up too much time in line and I don't want to be an annoying/picky customer but Jaden reassured me that not only did the company care about a good customer experience, but so did she! She asked me if I wanted to try any flavors and with every flavor I tried, Jaden told me a fact about the flavor like how they make each flavor with actual local ingredients, how the ice cream is 17% butter fat (I think that's what she said) and even how they even support local business! Ultimately I went with the Birthday Cake flavor because that was the seasonal choice (Always try the seasonal flavors! The permanent menu is gonna be there but the seasonal flavors are a little more special in my eyes!) but am definitely coming back to try the Strawberry Tres Leches flavor! The atmosphere that the workers gave off is such a productive one and seeing all the employees smile and laugh between one another even made me smile! Keep up the INCREDIBLE management & service!", "author": "Kobe A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-27", "description": "I was SO excited to learn they were adding a Salt & Straw to Hayes Valley. For those ice cream aficionados who prefer to venture beyond the vanillas of the world (though they also have a Double Fold Vanilla flavor which is among the better vanillas I have tried), Portland-born Salt & Straw is its own special oasis. Their flavors are innovative, often combining sweet and salty elements and incorporating local ingredients (the SF locations have a Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate flavor, as well as an Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache that incorporates locally produced almond brittle).\n\nI am also always delighted by their seasonal flavors, which change monthly and include a wide selection. For January, their theme was \"Vegan New Year\", for which they incorporated a selection of alarmingly creamy vegan flavors. My go-to order among their unchanging classic menu is Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches (which might strike some as a little sweet and includes ribbons of strawberry delight and chunks of cake rather than the pink monotony of classic strawberry), or Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache. If you go at a prime time (think weekend afternoons on a hot day or after lunch or dinner), don't be surprised if there is a line. The employees are super friendly and will let you taste as many flavors as you desire, which certainly helps validate the time consumption. Salt & Straw is a bit on the pricy side, but it is a boutique ice cream shop in SF (what else would one expect?) and is certainly worth the cost in my opinion. Pro tip: Consider buying a pint for $11 and skipping the line.", "author": "Kristen G."}

However, I've been here 3 times now in about a month span and every time I've gone, the service is horrible and it's never busy (because it's a weekday and during lunch). This third time I brought  my two co-workers to introduce them to these lovely flavors and we all walked out due to horrible customer service and that was my last straw since I came two previous times and disregarded the employee's behaviors. At this point i'm extremely hesitant to return to this location. I've been to the Portland, LA, and San Diego stores and all have been a wonderful experience however every time I've come to the Hayes location, the service is trash.
