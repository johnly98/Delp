{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-09", "description": "Eagle bars are all over the world including San Diego, Chicago (former city I lived in), Los Angeles and of course San Francisco.  It's a go to name for most leather bars.  None of them are connected except for two things, the name (with either the city name added) and that for the most part a leather bar.  I say that because I have visited most of these bars and some are more part of the leather community than others.  They have to survive in the current world of Social media wherein gay bars have been replaced by Social apps such as Grindr, Scruff and Recon.  Nothing really replaces face to face meeting groups in bars but some pooh pooh this connection.  They mostly seek an ideal meeting place online or regular sports bars or other venues to connect.\n\nAfter that mini lecture, let's examine this particular bar.  I review most places I go to but hesitate to do most bars.  Obviously, when it comes to personal choices, we don't have to reveal all of our activities to the world including places that most people don't frequent.  But Yelp has become a go to for visitors in the urban landscape, so I share my own experiences in bits and pieces but almost always on places I have at least been once or twice a year (out of town).  Most of my travels are for pleasure and family and not for business, so I visit to relax.  \n\nIf you are familiar with what SF Eagle is, then here is my take.  It's spacious with half of the place almost outdoors.  It gets busier on times when there is a specific event related to leather or the leather community is happening.  That being said, this only means more visitors and not necessarily the same people it would cater to.  Although we all want to be inclusive, the idea that someone in their shorts after a long afternoon out can come into to the same bar where most people are dressed for the event makes it different in my eyes.  No issues with this until the same people complain about service, environment and of course how this bar is not what they thought it could be.  I have been to many bars, I can't say most of them would not be considered the ideal place - noise, spilled beers, bathrooms with possibly hygiene issues and of course a large variety of clientele from the curious, to the extreme.  I have seen the SF Eagle busy and quiet.  However, I always come in with my expectations tamped down.  I know how to be patient on busy nights and not worry if the place is empty (less crowded).  I enjoy each visit because I don't try to idealize a place.\n\nSF Eagle can be what you want it to be, a different place to meet friends and strangers.  You have to come in with expectations that if it is a leather event, there might be men/women in gear (leather) in various forms.  On quieter times, seeing people in casual clothes is expected with a mix of some other leather persons.  Out of-town visitors seek similar places (like I do) in other cities they have visited - Berlin, London, Paris etc for like minded folks.  If you are one of those, always check the website.  If nothing is going on during that week or weekend, don't expect much but if its a particular event, prepare accordingly (crowds,mixed groups of people).", "author": "Melanio F."}

I made it rain like only a poor girl can. \n\nWhile it wasn't the most packed event I've ever been to, there were a reasonably large number of people crammed into a tiny space by the inside stage. A lot of pushing and shoving and no \"excuse me\"s. The outside stage was even worse. It's sort of like an outdoor patio courtyard type of place. Everyone was smoking! Cigarettes, cigars, and uh.... wacky tobaccy, too. I'm not against people using recreational marijuana, but at a bar? That's pushing it. \n\nMany of the bigger, taller men muscled their way to the front to get a better view.

And I was incredibly happy when it reopened after being closed for over a year.  But lately the smoking outside has become absolutely unbearable.  The attitude here is that if you don't like breathing cigarette smoke, then you should just leave.  \n\nThis is a really sad reality.  Especially 50 years after the Surgeon General said that smoking causes lung disease and it's now well known that 2nd hand smoke is dangerous.  \n\nSmokers here will light up and blow smoke in your face and nearly burn you with their lit cigarette and it doesn't matter where you try to take refuge.  Heck, I've actually been burned by their cigarettes being carelessly waved around.  Even if you're in the more covered parts of the bar, like the pergola style cover, where the airspace is even more confined. \n\n I've also seen people light up INSIDE at the back bar, which is an INDOOR space just off the back patio.  And no one says anything.  But if you're someone, like me (and my friends), who doesn't wish to breath their smoke... well, then it's just up to you to find some place else to stand.\n\nThe management of this bar doesn't care because they are all smokers and want to be able to smoke anywhere.  It's really sad for those of us who are not addicted to tobacco.  Because there is no place for us to enjoy ourselves on a sunny Sunday afternoon, except for the dark, mostly empty interior of the front bar.\n\nI would like to see the management set up the UPPER back patio area as a smoking area and not allow people to smoke elsewhere.  Or at the very least not allow people to smoke under the pergola, since the airspace is so confined under there that it's almost like an indoor space.\n\nNow for the reasons I give this bar 4 stars.

One of the little Napoleonic guards was taking people's tallboys away and trashing them while they waited in line for doors to open.  \n\nThe staff inside the bar (not the security force, mind you) is pretty friendly and attentive.  We went up to the bar multiple times and never waited more than 30 seconds for a drink.  The patio is has heat lamps and was even set up with a bootblack station where a guy in assless leather chaps was shining away boots.\n\nAt one point I wanted to leave briefly for a pack of smokes and come back, so I asked the staff inside the doorway if that would be okay.  No problem at all, they said. But then the security guards outside said we would have to wait in the massive line again.  Really?  Because I did, after all, pay $15 for this show and am wearing my wristband.  \n\nAlso, show was way overpacked.", "author": "Eric F."}

A while ago I was in the restroom and this guy tried to reach over to grab me and I told him I wasn't interested and he continued after I asked him nicely. Then I told him to f#$k off and left the bar. The next time I went in one of the owners (Mike) pulled me to the side and told me he got multiple complaints about me from the last time I was here and said I was intoxicated which I wasn't because I live in Sacramento and do not drink and drive and only came up for a day trip that day. He threatened to kick me out if he gets anymore complaints and I didn't even remember what he was talking about since I rarely come here because I live in Sacramento. Didn't even give me a chance to think and tell my side of the story. From this day on the big heftier owner(not Mike) would give me dirty looks every time he would see me. One day one of my friends smoked him out and my friend introduced us not knowing that he didn't like me and he was very rude and gave me a dirty look. I brushed it off.. I came back Folsom weekend and the heftier owner was intoxicated and was harassing me the whole time I was there. He said \"didn't I kick you out 5 times already?\" Then he said \"leave now\" but I didn't since I was there hanging with my friends/ my ride home. He continued to walk by giving me dirty looks so I just left to the lonestar where my business is appreciated and I just let my ride know. Last time I'll ever go to the SF eagle.

The nature of our acquaintanceship is purely business and was always cordial, which is why when Lex and Mike were in a bind and needed to \"borrow\" money from me, I had no problem fronting it to them with the agreement that they would pay me back as they were reimbursed in increments with free product from the company I worked for. I left the company late last year but couldn't collect from Lex and Mike as they hadn't yet been reimbursed with free product. I informed them of my departure and they agreed to stay in touch until the repayment to me was resolved. We finally met in March of this year. Mike insisted he paid me half the owed amount in December before I left. That's where the problem started. They gave me half via check that day in early March and continued to press that they gave me a Visa gift card in December 2015 before I left for another job opportunity. Interesting thing is though, Mike's excel ledger that he records all business transactions in, was conveniently corrupted. Lex and Mike are pretty great actors as they tried in front of me for about 20 minutes to \"open\" a file that turned out to be \"corrupted.\" I've asked them to check on their end to see where the card they're claiming they gave me was spent. They said they'd look into it......now they're just ignoring me. Truly, this wouldn't bother me as much if I wasn't a single mother raising a 17-month old son with bills to pay. But I'm trying to pay off medical bills from when my son and i didn't have insurance in the later part of my maternity leave. Why am I writing this?

Tell our electeds why this IS OUR SPACE!\n\nMILK CLUB LETTER ON THE EAGLE CLUB'S SALE\nIt has recently come to our attention that a non-LGBT group of entrepreneurs has entered into a purchase agreement for the former Eagle Tavern. This comes as a shock to many in the LGBT community as there was no outreach done or notice given about this historical community space despite the fact that many LGBT San Franciscans had expressed much interest in the building's future. Furthermore our community had previously heard that there were queer entrepreneurs in negotiation to take over this space; buyers who intended to return it to a place that would continue to serve as a center to those who previously patronized the Eagle and enjoyed it as a LGBT-friendly space.\nThis startling change of course has caused great concern within those of us who considered the Eagle as a haven and who still view it as a revered symbol of San Francisco's continued struggle with the HIV/AIDS epidemic and a critical meeting site for the marginalized queer community. To our dismay, such spaces are becoming scarcer, and our marginalization is becoming more profound. The Eagle is more than a bar and a business, yet current city processes appear to regard it as just another tavern. The Eagle is hallowed ground for us, and we as stakeholders must participate in any decisions about its future through a vigorous community-wide dialogue where all voices can be heard.\nWe offer here several specific reasons why we consider the Eagle to be a sacred space. They are given so that you can understand and respect our alarm at these developments:\n\n*The ashes of gay men and women who died during the AIDS epidemic are scattered there.\n*The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have blessed it as hallowed queer space and have used it to veil many postulants.\n*Over its 30 year history over $50 million was raised for charities, particularly HIV/AIDS organizations.\n**It was a place that was accessible to the full spectrum of diversity of the LGBT community.\nIt was our community center.\n\nGiven the historical, cultural, and emotional significance of this site we find it just to demand a process where all members of the queer community have an opportunity to participate in decisions regarding its future. We demand that an open meeting be held at the earliest possible date and ask that our elected officials, community representatives, the general public, and all key parties be in attendance. We also believe that the Eagle must be given Historic Landmark status.\nSouth of Market is undergoing a massive shift in its composition and it is important to allow members of the community to speak for themselves before rash decisions about its future are made. We look forward to this discussion.\n\nYour name here!\n\nJane.Kim@sfgov.org (D6 home of the Eagle)\nScott.Weiner@sfgov.org (D8)\nChristina.Olague@sfgov.org (D5 and head of committee reg. liquor license transfer)\nDavid.Chiu@sfgo.org (D3 President of the BOS)\nDavid.Campos@sfgov.org (D9)\nJohn.Avalos@sfgov.org (D11)\nSean.Elsbernd@sfgov.org (D7 on committee for liquor license transfer)\nCarmen.Chu@sfgov.org (D4)\nMark.Farrell@sfgov.org (D2)\nMalia.Cohen@sfgov.org (D10)\nEric.L.Mar@sfgov.org (D1)\nEd.Lee@sfgov.org (Mayor)", "author": "Anna C."}

My verdict is that Thursday Nite Live is one of the best music nights around the Bay Area.\n\nEven though after this past Thursday I don't really wanna write anything because there were SO MANY FREAKING PEOPLE THERE it was hard to move, get a drink, find friends, hear yourself talk, etc. I've never seen so many people at the Eagle Tavern which is, I guess, good for the spot's cred and longevity, but it also seemed to be contaminated by more than it's share of douches (of which they are usually a negligible amount) this particular Thursday. Even the outside patio, usually a spacious respite from the microscopic inner bar, felt like a can of sardines. Really, really good looking sardines.\n\nANYWAY, onto the music--Bay Area gems like Thee Oh Sees, the Fresh & Onlys, Mayyors, etc. etc. etc. play here on the regular and give SPECTACULAR shows--there's something about the totally cramped, weirdly shaped audience area that just sends people into hysterics and it makes it hard not to get caught up in everyone else's energy.

When I frequent the Eagle in Los Angeles, the place is pretty busy and exciting!  What I walked into was what seemed to be a dead night.  Really?  Dead on a Saturday Night?  I surveyed the place, comparing it to the Eagle LA and browsing the locals.  A few comments and calls towards me lifted my spirits to let me know this place was alive!  Yes...this dawg was without a chain...maybe next time, you'll grab a leash and -- Oh wait...back to the review!\n\nThe music was decent, though I didn't notice a DJ unless I wasn't looking hard enough.  I was told I missed an event earlier in the day and optimistically hope to find busier days!  Overall, I find the dark atmosphere to be very alluring.  I did see some very attractive guys roaming the corners, though being the pup I am...must wait to be approached.  \n\nThe patio is probably what made me the happiest.  It was VERY sizeable and relaxing!  This was the spot of choice for me to enjoy my (excessively strong) drink.  I will admit, the drink was still tasty, AND it was 2.50 less than down the street at the Stud Bar where another event was going on.  I thought the drink being served in a mason mug was a nice touch.  I look forward to returning on a busier night with mischief in mind!\n\nSadly, I am not local to San Francisco, so my visits will be monthly at best.

I rarely see any Harleys parked out front, but still all the men are dressed in Harley tees and leather gear. I assume they are bike lovers but decided a Prius would be more practical. On second thought, drinking and bike riding probably isn't a good combination, so perhaps they are smart by not riding their bikes to the bar.\n\nThe last time I was there, the music was far out, old trippy rock n roll that was way too mellow for such a rambunctious crowd.

It was the memorable night of \"these cheaps are drink!\" fame, and the kickass bartender who looked like Sammy Hagar, and the gay porn, and oh, the good times...\n\nA year later, my would-be SuperBF stumbled in there looking for an ATM on the way to our first booty call (yes, you read that right). He found the ATM, and he also discovered that the Eagle Tavern, though filled with gay men who might be checking him out in a manly-gay-man kind of way, looked like a really cool place to hang out. IF HE DIDN'T HAVE A GIRL TO GO HOOK UP WITH. THAT'S RIGHT. A GIRL.\n\nA year later, SuperBF and I found ourselves back there, at a fundraiser for Dykes on Bikes, drinking free beer and eating free food, listening to our friends singing with the soul cover band Kyra and the Tender Morsels on the back patio. Rockin' our socks off. Getting drunker than skunks with a lot of tough lesbian chicks, even though we were due at his elderly aunt and uncle's in Palo Alto for dinner later that evening. Seriously wishing we could just hang with the Dykes on Bikes and the Tender Morsels instead.\n\nNeither I, nor Nadja, nor SuperBF are gay. We do not ride bikes.

I've danced on it, played the stage, puked in corners, been naked, pissed in jars in the DJ booth, shown my bush in order to get happy hour prices on beard night,  and once got kissed by one of the owners to show me that gay men kiss better. To be fair, I'd just say that he didn't prove that gay guys kiss better, he proved that maybe gay BIKERS kiss better, but that's another story. \n\nThis bar was taken over by its current owners because the Hole was, at the time, getting taken over by Castro boys, and they needed to take the party elsewhere. But they went hog wild. These two men KNOW what a bar shoud be like. \n\nAmongst the many special touches are the benches out on the patio. Notice that they're cut into three slabs. That middle slab? The thin one? Was built deliberately to have some give. This is so your ass doesn't get sore from sitting on some unforgiving, flat bench. Also note the heat lamps above so's you don't freeze said ass off in the colder months.  \n\nThe driftwood chair's got a drink tray and it and the gearhead fountain next to it were made by one of the owners. And it's fun to straddle the fence above the grill and spit into the fire. \n\nBeer bust on Sundays is really more for the nouveau leather boy crew, in my experience---but I haven't been to a beer bust here in so long who knows what goes on now.\n\nAnyways, it's a home away from home.

He's amazing, he has such a lovely energy and enthusiasm that precious few SOMA Bartenders can match. Sometimes I just want to shake him until he's blurry, especially after a long day of work and you walk in and he warms you right up and makes everything right as rain. Very few people can do that and he's definitely an asset. \n2) Thursday Night Live. What an awesome event. It's mixed crowd, so you get your gays, your lesbians and straight peoples all mixed together to live music. I'm sure there's a lot of crossover too, cuz some of them straight nerdy boys that wander in from the Mission ... let's just say I'm glad Eagle has this night. Anything to get my recruitment quota up. I just need two more straight to gay conversions and Ellen DeGeneres will send me a toaster oven!\n3) Speaking of straight people... One of my favorite things to do is take straight friends from out of town into the middle room between the inside and the patio and tell them to look at the hundreds of dirty jock straps and underwear that hang from the ceiling. It's a great way to welcome them to San Francisco from parts Puritan, because really, there's nothing more quintessentially San Francisco than that.", "author": "scott r."}

So naturally, we go to the bear bar & no one had the slightest problem with the straight couple making out. Very open-minded. Of course, they didn't know he was a priest, I guess. \n\nMost recently I saw the Guy-Guys there, an all guys Go-Go's cover band, kind of like a cross between the Go-Go's and maybe the New York Dolls, only crazier.

The motorcyclists who hang out there tend to be of the (dare I say it?) more twinkish and/or punkish variety. And another warning: if you're at all crowd-phobic, do like I do and avoid the Sunday beer bust, esp. on warm sunny days.

The typical demographic here is aging hippie biker bear, but outsiders will certainly not be stared at or frowned upon (groped, maybe). There is a rectangular bar island in the middle of the first room and a stage in the back. The restrooms, interestingly, can only be accessed via the stage, so good luck during a live performance. Also, the main restroom is just a trough (equipped with a mirror at penis height) and a standalone toilet. The other, more \"private\" bathroom is a toilet behind a swinging door. A third bathroom is simply another exposed trough out back. The second room is a dark, second bar, manned by a lone, sketchy bartender. The coolest space is outside, where there is yet a third bar. This space is more like a large private backyard, with big fences and foliage on the periphery. \n\nThe target audience (you know who you are) will feel right at home.

Additionally, I love the live music on Thursday nights, although I sometimes go home with my ears ringing.  Bear (I mean beer) Bust on Sundays is always a specticle.  If you want to see a lot of bear chested men, I suggest going.  And the drinks...as mentioned before are S-T-I-F-F- just like other body parts you may or may not see on any given night.", "author": "Jason W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-22", "description": "This bar is always fun. The bathroom situation does stress me out a bit, especially after I dropped my panties in the men's bathroom on the stage and someone walked in on me (thankfully, I knew the guy, but still, a bit awkward.) There's a port-a-pot in the back garden area, and maybe a set of troughs for the boys in the back, but I always walk on stage and usually wait in line for the ladies room (the one with the door). On a side note, why do women take so long to pee? I pee frequently, but at least I pee quickly. The bands that play are usually good (I think I usually go on Thursdays?) - unless you go on an off night and you're not drinking - then this place can be pretty shitty. I don't know what it is about the Eagle, but I really cannot just order a beer. It has to come with a shot of whiskey, and then the trouble begins. Something about this place just calls out to the inner alcoholic in you and you just want to rage all night.", "author": "Brittany L."}

It's usually packed with a great variety of guys - something for everyone. Claim a spot or you'll spend your time there fighting your way through the crowds.
