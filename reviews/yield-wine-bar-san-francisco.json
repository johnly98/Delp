It wasn't too busy, so we managed to find a table by the restroom.\n\nHappy Hour Half-Bottle Carafes till 7pm ($17 / Regular $21):\n*Sauvignon Blanc, Kalex, \"Alex K\", Marlborough, New Zealand '15\n*Tempranillo, ibuenas!, Vino De Espana '14\n\nApparently we arrived in time for HH, so a friend of mine just ordered the two wines to share. In general, they were drinkable table wines, but not really up my alley. I like my whites crisper and my reds more full bodied. Service was great though and our waiter was attentive. The wine bar was low key and we were able to chill and talk for the hour and a half we were here.\n\nGood, bright wine bar to throw back a couple glasses of wine.

She has been here before, while I have never been. This place was a pleasant surprise. I expected something on the classier since - mainly because it is a wine bar. That being said, while this place is classy, it does have some awesome paintings. There are Steve Urkel, Ninja Turtles and some police officer cartoon picture. Awesome! We got here closer to 6pm and it was just us and two other ladies. There are two separate rooms and somewhat divides the wine bar. Overall, the vibe is classy hipster, if that makes any sense.\n\nThe food is pretty limited. There are flatbread pizzas you can order, we ordered this artichoke dip and some other things that I don't really remember. The dip was solid, good stuff with leaks on top. \n\nOnto the main reason for going to this place. The wine. We both like Zinfandels and there was one on their menu. Very solid choice. I like the rusty oakey taste that goes along with Zins. The majority of the wines are from Sonoma County. Nice that Yield stays local. \n\nIt did start getting busier around 7pm. From what I heard from the bartender there is a trivia night. We thought that would be cool to check out but we started getting hungry but that time and wanted more than just small bites. Otherwise, I think we would have stayed.\n\nGreat choice to go to after work.", "author": "Mark G."}

YOLO! Ok, ok... more like ratchet. \n\nNow that I'm in my 30s, all I care about is wrinkle cream, flats, spanx, and sleep. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still like going out at night and getting a happy buzz but I don't want to deal with parking, long lines, crowds, and running into my friend's younger sibling(s).\n\nMe: \"Oh hey, what are you doing here?\"\nFriend's younger sibling: \"It's my homegirl's 21st birthday. What are YOU doing here?\"\n\nMe: \"........\"\n\nUmm yah, so wine bars are now my BFF. \n\nYield Wine Bar is perfect for someone like me; someone that still wants to enjoy the night life without getting all ratchet. Street parking is plentiful. Getting a seat isn't a problem before 10 pm (there's two communal tables for larger groups). And, the chances of getting sh*tfaced is minimal since they don't serve hard liquor. It's also a great date place as it's more intimate and the music isn't blaring so you can actually hold a conversation. \n\nYield serves sustainable, organic and biodynamic (eco-friendly) wine. For wines by the glass, there were about 5 selections each for sparkling, white, and red wine ranging from $9-$13. Bottles ranged from mid $30s to low $80s. Happy hour is Monday - Friday, 4:30 pm - 7 pm and half bottle carafes are $12. \n\nThey also have a rotating bar bite menu with vegan options (Hi John & Chel!). On the night that we went, there were nuts, olives, cheese, dips, and flatbreads on the menu ($6-$13). Kitchen closes at 10 pm. \n\nI had a glass of the sparkling rose and a chardonnay that I wasn't too crazy about but that's just me as I prefer Italian or French wines. The food and service more than made up for it though. \n \nMy gf and I shared the grilled brussel sprouts ($6), cod sliders (2 for $8), and the Parisian flatbread ($13) for a late dinner. The cod sliders are a must order. A pan-fried cod patty topped with a creamy sriracha aioli, buttery avocados, and sandwiched between a pillowy Hawaiian bun. I love sweet and salty combos so the Parisian flatbread was an easy choice as it was topped with brie, apples, and caramelized onions: http://bit.ly/1mYxUOp. The flatbread had a nice crunch with great flavors from the m\u00e9nage a trois of ingredients but the apples could have been sliced thinner as it had more of a mushy texture.\n\nWe spent over 3 hours at Yield and we never felt rushed. Our waitress was an absolute sweetheart and kept checking in with us to make sure everything was ok. \n\nDefinitely adding Yield to my weekend rotation as they close at midnight which gives me enough time to go home to catch an episode of Cheaters.

I was actually there the day it opened and was one of their first customers.  Their food is very good, and the atmosphere is nice. \n\nThey no longer take reservations for groups, so the new system is that you show up and wait for people to vacate tables.  We did that and told the waitress that we had a large group, she agreed that we should just keep our eyes open.  They also had a couple of other groups, so it was really packed.  The first problem is that there were only two people working on a Friday night.  \n\nWe got one table with no problem.  When a second table next to us opened up, someone from my group asked if it was ours and the waitress told him yes.  That's when it got weird, really weird.  Our group started to sit at the table and she came running over saying that the table was \"reserved for the general public\", this was just minutes after she had given it to us.  We asked why we were not considered a part of the \"general public\", why the time we had waited didn't count, and why she had given us the table only to take it away.  She never gave a rational response, just the same general public comment.  At this point more of our group was showing up and it was getting packed in our little corner.\n\nAbout a half an hour later we were able to get another table, but she came over and kicked us out of that table stating that we could only have one table per group.  The table we had sat 8, the one we were trying to add sat 2, we had a gradually enlarging group that ended up being 30+ people.  We would have been fine if she had let us expand as tables vacated, but she insisted that we we all share that first table even though we were ordering food and drinks.  We had to eat standing up.  All night she was extremely rude to us and pushed past people.  I'm sure it wasn't that fun for the people next to us either.  \n\nShe also insisted that all of us share one tab.  A few people managed to trick her and order from the bar, but she \"caught\" them and made them add on to our tab.  As you can imagine that was fun for me to untangle.    \n\nThis woman continued to be incredibly rude to us all evening, up until the check came.  This lunatic actually thought she'd be getting a tip.  I did give the other guy a small tip because while he was aloof, he didn't actually yell at us.    \n\nThis was the absolute worst service I've had anywhere, ever.  This woman went out of her way to be rude to us to the point that everyone kept asking what had happened.", "author": "Tonie C."}

We asked for some cheese and red pepper flakes and the guy said that there was enough cheese on the pizza LOL why couldn't he just say \"we don't have any cheese sorry\" I asked for an extra plate... We got it when we were already finished. By the time we asked for our check we were the only customers there and we had to ask twice for it and just ended up walking up to the register.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-10", "description": "I could wax poetic about this place endlessly. It is my new favorite thing in San Francisco, pretty much.\n\nMy first experience here was with parentals in tow. We were lucky enough to hit happy hour specials, and much wine was shared all around. The happy hour carafe is a good deal, and the wine is actually decent wine. Most happy hour carafe deals are pretty low quality wine, but not at Yield! We shared several dishes, of which the brussels sprouts were definitely a real standout.\n\nI returned recently and with glee. I settled in to do some work, and Francesca was very fast with bringing me water and offering if I needed wifi password information. Once I was joined, we got a couple glasses of wine and shared some food. Once again, awesome brussels, along with a roasted butternut flatbread. Everything was absolutely delicious. It's so refreshing to go somewhere that is wine focused but doesn't insist that every pairing be meat or cheese. The veg options here are just so good, and they're reasonably priced. At happy hour, they become a downright bargain.\n\nThe best part of the Yield experience, though, is Nic, your friendly wine-slinger. He is energetic, friendly, and seems to be having a fantastic time every time he is at work. He zips between parties, having conversation with everyone, keeping everyone's glasses full, and delivering food seamlessly. He knows his wine, and will happily give recommendations, or let you make your own way. He is so fun, and he makes you feel like he is just so excited/happy that you're there. It's hard to be in anything other than a great mood when you're being taken care of by Nic.\n\nUltimately, the real problem with this place is that it's in the Dogpatch. I almost want to live there just so I can spend all my free time and money at Yield. But I'd settle for someone opening a swanky wine bar on my block in the Tenderloin. Anyone? Please? Till then, I guess I'll just keep commuting to Yield.", "author": "Vivienne P."}

I brought everyone I could there to enjoy the great selection of organic wines in a casual, comfortable environment.  The small bites were great for a light dinner or as an appetizer for dinner elsewhere.  The staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nMuch of that has changed.  The past three times I've visited there was only one waiter/waitress who was absolutely frantic ... despite not being that crowded.\n\nOnce I came there with a group of 6 people, and just after we were served our first glass, we were asked to move to a different table for a group of 10 people that was coming in (even though there are no reservations offered).  We felt it was a little rude but still complied.  We playfully asked if we could get a free glass for our troubles and were told absolutely not.  We would have been happy with nothing if the waiter had returned the joke or at least been courteous with us.\n\nAnother time I came in with a date who asked if she could taste two different wines.  We were told only one taste per customer is permitted.  We countered that one can't make a choice from only one option.  Rather than simply give us a small taste (like every other wine bar in existence) or say \"sorry but I'm really not allowed\" the response was a flat \"Only one taste per customer.\"\n\nYield went from someplace I enjoyed brining my friends and coworkers to, a place where the staff recognized me and were happy to see me, to a place where the waitstaff are overworked and rude and where management doesn't seem to understand that giving $1 worth of wine to someone who will pay $50 on a bottle is a good investment.", "author": "Garth W."}

I've worked in the service industry and large groups are sometimes hard to manage, so I normally take such reviews with a grain of salt.  But my recent experience at Yield, with a party of three, was so strange and disappointing, I decided to add my experience to the bad reviews.\n\nI've been to Yield about 4 or 5 times and always had excellent to pretty good service. That's also how my evening started out, securing a spot and a couple of glasses of wine and some snacks. The weirdness happened when we were joined by a third person after about 45 minutes. The wait staff seemed to be actively ignoring us for about 15 minutes. Then one of us went to the bar and both of the staff refused to acknowledge him. Finally, when another one of our party approached the woman who had been serving us very pleasantly so far and asked her politely, \"when you have a moment, we'd like to order some more wine + food...\" the woman turned and said flatly, \"it'll be a while\".\n\nWe were really shocked and unsure of what just happened.  We decided to leave immediately.  When I paid the bill, the other staff member didn't seem surprised we were leaving so soon and didn't ask how our evening was going or make any kind of conversation at all.\n\nIt seems quite in line with what the other low reviewers have said here. We were a small, quiet group and are always respectful of servers' time - were we not drinking enough?

The whites were very enjoyable, and the reds that I tried (the first pinot noir on the list and the blend from Field Recordings) were fantastic. The serving sizes were on the generous side, which considering the pricier nature of this place is definitely a good thing. \n\nThe service was absolutely great.

You need more options.  The menu is way too limited, and needs more variety.  I think you should always have 3-4 wines of each varietal, not just strictly one of each type.  Should offer flights, because I can tell you, any wine fanatics go goo goo ga ga for that stuff.  Offer crackers to every guest, to help clean their palate.  And pricing, was a bit much, but its SF.  Perhaps that's normal.  The menu was decent.  Had a nice selection, but I guess its a small place so you can only do so much.  It also seemed a little too quiet, and needed something to add to the atmosphere.  Perhaps some indie alternative music or more wall art?  Feel like I'm being a consultant now, sorry.\n\nWell, i've been to one wine bar that told me that they bought some of their stuff thru Grocery Outlet.  So if you serve your nice stuff, cool, but consider adding some budget stuff in there too.  Won't hit your pocket too hard, and since your the expert, find some that are good and mark it up to serve to us.  Bam, you got yourself more fans.  Just saying.", "author": "Janice F."}

Anyhow Mr. RV, who is no longer with the company, and is or was friends with the owner of the place, convinced our traveling work fellows to come here.  A group of about 14 of us came to discuss the logistics of the UCSF Mission Bay Project. Maybe because the guy (the owner) knew Rob he felt as if it was acceptable to have us wait a half-hour to be seated in an empty establishment. I asked if he had the place reserved for a party or maybe a series of expected tables, but he just said that most of the tables are unofficially reserved for his regulars. My manager, along with most of the party I was with was upset. When we did get seated it was on a low seating log like furniture. I'm still spry enough to not particularly be bothered by it, but I was the youngest in the group, and most of the people in the clique complain about flying first class for more than a few hours.  All this before we are even served, and on a napkin no less. I understand that the menu consists of small plates, but I (along with the rest my party) felt they are better served on plates than napkins. The worst was yet to come. One of my co-workers gets tired of the owner's non-answers to whether he had actual plates in the kitchen, and decides to get up and ask the busser for plates. The busser gleefully obliges by handing over a dozen or so small plates. Now this is where the situation becomes awkward, the owner breaks into action and snatches the plates from my co-workers hands only to scurry off into the back with them the way my baby son would his fire truck. It turns out he had plates, but just thought it would be easier to not use them. Lastly the wine here is an afterthought, especially with it being a supposed \"wine bar\". We had some forgettable screw top Malbec that I've seen at Trader Joes for $3.99, I didn't pay so I wasn't too concerned, but $32 is still a much more than the standard three to four time markup.

We went there on a early Saturday evening and while it was dead empty then, by the time we left around 10, it was packed.  Good sign for a new place in a still developing area.\n\nYield features a nice, balanced assortment of organic wines, including some well-priced ones.  They also have some small plates of course to accompany your wine selection.  We tried several items over the course of the evening: the Sunchoke Parmesan Dip with Toasted Pinenuts was served warm and quite savory and delicious; the Parmesan-Crusted Tartine with Eggplant Confit, Goat Cheese, and Mint was its equal in satisfaction; and the Smoked Fish Trio and the Pcoc Dolce Chocolate Tiles were solid as well. \n\nService was friendly and generally attentive.

For a homebody, that's pretty important.\n\nSecond of all, there's free street parking. For a San Franciscan and former Los Angelena, that's pretty amazing.\n\nThird of all, the atmosphere is so comfortable. The lighting is dim but not so dim that you can't see if you're sitting on a suspicious stain, the leather couches offer you comfy derriere and back support and you don't have to be dressed to the nines to feel like you fit in.\n\nFourth of all (I've never actually seen/heard this phrase used...is it actually usable?), the staff (actually, just the one guy we saw) was awesome and had spot-on recommendations. Nic usually works at Pause but happened to be at Yield the first night the Husband and I went and he was awesome. Super friendly, made us feel right at home and the wines he suggested were perfect. I guess it helps that Yield has good wines to begin with but Nic was terrific. Also, the music was great. Fitzgerald + Sinatra is an unbeatable combination.\n\nFifth of all (again, never heard this but I'm using it), the food was tasty. I heard that it used to be cheaper but the price of everything else is going up so Yield had to yield. We tried the burrata (it came with toast, arugula, some kind of fabulous melon and finishing salt) and the pakora (with two different types of sauce). Good stuff. The table next to us had ordered practically everything else and the cod sliders looked amazing. \n\nI can't wait to go back. Nic says that Francesca (the brunette) and Maggie (the blond) are just as cool so I'm excited.\n\nP.S.

As a wine enthusiast who can be considered a wine alcoholic, I have tried several different types of wine and didn't have any problems with any of them.\n\nSo what's some tasty wine without some equally tasty snacks? Have no worries, because Yield can hook you up with the food like they do the wine. Lots of yummy and seasonal things to whet your palate while you're whetting your palate. Yum yum yum! The staff can suggest to you what you might want depending on your preferred taste, and can tell you what the perfect wine pairing will be.\n\nWhich is a perfect segway into our next topic...the staff! I have been multiple times and have always loved my time with Francesca and Nic. Francesca is just all sorts of fun, and is necessary to keep Nic in line. Nic is just a fun and cute fellow to sit and chat with, and not just because he has an awesome name (yay!). Sit at the bar, and you'll love talking with the two of them, being silly and giddy, and perhaps getting yourself into trouble (which, future warning...it'll most likely be because of Francesca...) \n\nYou might be saying \"But it's so far away! I would have to take the T-line to get there, and that takes forever!\" Well, guess what? Just do it! It's worth it!

It's hard to say.\n\nThe limited food menu was pretty good, albeit a bit pricey. \n\nThe Chevre-Stuffed Medjool Dates were marvelous, the oyster plater standard fare (although the pop-rocks-seasoned oyster with a birthday candle was a great touch and tooootally weird and awesome), the Warm Spinach Dip had a slight chalky undertone (like goat cheese-esque) (but not bad), and the stuffed endives were tasty like Coko's pastries (if you get this, marry me please). \n\nBut you come here for the wine, right?\n\nUnfortunately, Yield was out of the one Riesling on the menu the night I went... which, sorry to say, is like going to a bar and ordering a gin & tonic but they're out of gin....... :| We ended up ordering a suggested alternative white along with another red, neither of which I personally was a fan of.\n\nThe bartender/host with the bleached blonde hair was perfectly adorable and quirky. The chef popped out for a minute, but like a fetus who decided to be unborned, popped back into the kitchen just as soon; it was bizarre and cute.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're anything like me, a classy wine bar like this place is not really your cup of tea, but if you don't really ever trip about spending that cash and don't mind a fantastic voyage just to get to this remote jungle/outer limits, then as far as wine bars go, Yield is definitely not bad.\n\n11/9...

I was waiting for my friend so felt a little awkward at first but he made me feel right at home.  You know a hot girl sitting in a bar by herself relays a certain message (cheeseball...).\nAnyhow, I tried the Frappato Centoze (bright and light red, not tannin), Syrah/Grenache/Mourvedre which was definitely bold and had the fig notes which I really liked. You can order a 1/2 a glass too so I had 1/2 a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tsantali Organics.  I liked it alot as well-smooth cab and dry.  She had the Sangiovese which was ok for me as Sangiovese's do have a little medicinal flavor that I'm not that fond of.  \nFoodwise, we tried the stuffed figs (delish: sweet, nutty and moist). The cod sliders are pan fried and moist; they were accompanied with french fries which reminded me of McDonald's fries (Like). We had the hard cheese plate garnished with sliced strawberries, grapes and acme bread.\nAll in all-really good service with a pleasant, casual atmosphere. Unmetered street parking is a big Plus.

I rather hurriedly chose it while on the phone with my colleague making plans to meet at a mutually convenient location. I live in SF, she lives in Pacifica... it took us both about 15 minutes to get here. It's quite conveniently located just off the freeway.\n\nI am partial to the funky Dogpatch neighborhood, and so was excited by the location. However, this little place won me over with its warm atmosphere, friendly service, and insanely delicious food. The wine, this is a wine bar after all, was great, but I will admit I only tried the happy hour special (which changes each day). The carafe served up two very large glasses of wine, for $10. The particular variety was one that I like, so it did have an advantage. We were so happy with it, we ordered nothing else to drink!\n\nI also give kudos for the fact that their wines are all certified organic, most bio-dynamic in some way. I was worried that this would mean the wine wasn't very good, but I loved it, as I mentioned.\n\nThe restaurant is divided into two areas, the cozy couch/ottoman area which feels very homey... like someone has a bar in their loft living room. And on the right side they have tall table and bar stools; sparse, but cozy nonetheless, with a chalkboard menu and a little denatured alcohol flame running in the room.\n\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention the food, which was an afterthought for us (we had not come to eat, really). We chose the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad (the taste summer right there), the fried okra (which might have been the best I've ever had), and a creamy spinach dip (with this parmesan crisp on the top that was to die for)... all I can say is don't leave with out trying *something* from their short, seasonal menu. The prices were quite reasonable, and well worth the delight of eating them.\n\nI will be going there again very soon; great place to take a client, a date, or a group of friends.", "author": "Nicole B."}

Its style is understated hip, dark and atmospheric with great music, a place where you make your own experience with the people that you come with and what you bring in.  \n\nI'm telling you all of this because it would be easy to overlook the subtleties of this place - especially with the senses overload that we are all used to.\n\nGreen Bunny and I had a nice time there on a recent weekday evening.   We sipped the recommended Syrah (excellent), nibbled on a cheese plate (small, but satisfying), and caught up on our lives (fascinating, of course).\n\nIt's a quick trip on the T from downtown, or just off of the 280 if you are driving.", "author": "Liz S."}

Note: the wine bar is now open on Monday nights. Parking was not an issue at 9:15p on Monday. \n\nThere were a few other folks. JB and I settled ourselves into the leather section sofa underneath the front window. Immediately, water is brought to our table and wine lists placed in front of us. We were in a serious talking mood so instead of asking for flights or tastings, we both reached into our respective minds and asked for wines from specific regions. \n\nChris, the owner, had a Petite Syrah from Dry Creek Valley (my new favorite wine region in Sonoma). He knows his wines well. My friend JB managed a 60 seat fine dining establishment in her previous life and was talking Italian wines with Chris. \n\nThe bathroom was spotless. I wondered aloud if it would be just as clean on a Friday night and Chris said, \"Yes, I make sure of it.\"\n\nChris was friendly but knew when to walk away and leave us to our discussion. Music was alternately soft and loud, which was a bit strange. However, he even played Patsy Cline...gotta love that. Despite us being the only folks in the bar from 10p till 11p, Chris showed no signs of kicking us out. Very gracious. \n\nI would like to return here on another night and do some tastings (if allowed) and also inquire if there are flights. Plus, I want to try some of the vegan food as described in other reviews. I wonder if the kitchen was closed on a Monday night? Our menus were of wines, no food and I forgot to ask.\n\nMy glass of wine, by the way, was $15...generous pour, robust and fruity but not too sweet. Normally, I do not like Petite Syrah, but I will try anything from Dry Creek Valley. I'm hoping that Chris will offer Zinfandel from Dry Creek by the glass (right now it's by the bottle) in the near future. JB hopes Chris will carry Marchesi di Barolo Ruvei Barbera d' Alba. \n\nAgain, this was the PERFECT place to go for a mellow Monday night talk.\n\nI look forward to my next visit.", "author": "Grace C."}

It is however just around the corner from one of the best breakfast places called \"Just for You Cafe.\"\n\nWhen you walk in there is a small bar and the rest of the main room is filled with leather chairs and a few \"trunks\" to sit on. The next room has abut 4 or 5 tables; the rooms are both very dark.\n\nI go back and forth between whites and reds but this time I tried a few of the whites and a glass of their sparkling wine.\n\nFirst up was the Gamble Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc- SO light and not sweet- it was pretty good. You can do either a 2oz, 6oz or a full glass. I did 2 oz tastings and then a glass of the sparkling wine.\n\nNext up was the Chardonnay/Viognier from France- another tasting wine that wasn't too heavy or oaky. Normally I am a fan of the more buttery chards but this one was light and I enjoyed it.\n\nNext up- glass of the Pinot Blanc Reisling- I was happy with this and glad it wasn't too wine tasting. It was a nice fresh crisp glass that I enjoyed.\n\nNow what would a wine bar be without some good food right? This place does not disappoint. Try the olives and the artichoke dip for sure.

I was looking for an interesting place I'd never been to (ie. opened up after I left), which seemed relaxing and didn't look too loud so we could all hear each other. Yield definitely seemed to fit the bill, although it also had an added bonus  - parking. I didn't want wherever we were going to meet to be a \"Yo everyone! I'm back! Let's kick it after you spend an hour driving around the same block looking for a parking spot\" kind of place, so the location was perfect. Also, I just wanted to see the completed T line with my own eyes, and there it was. With no T running on it.\n\nAnyway, I'd say the atmosphere inside is great. Smallish, darkish, and comfortable. Great music and good service. I had an organic  tempranillo which was extremely smooth and a nice biodynamic pinot which complemented the olive tapenade flatbread perfectly. None of my friends who met me there knew Yield even existed before, and they all gave the place a thumbs up. We hung out there for a few hours and in that time we saw the crowds ebb and flow, but it never got too packed. Every customer still had a place to sit in either room.\n\nDownsides include the lack of an extensive food menu (given the location is so separated from everything else), and a more extensive choice of wines (but I'll overlook this - given how many organic/biodynamic wineries actually exist), but all in all, a great discovery.

I thought organic, sustainable, biodynamic wine would be expensive, hard to compare with \"normal\" wine, and impossible to buy anywhere other than this wine bar.  I was wrong.  It turns out that many \"normal\" vineyards (especially European ones) go about their business in a way that qualifies them as organic, biodynamic, or sustainable, and that means there are some great wines here that you might actually be able to purchase on your own.  There are also some uncommon combinations or sources that make the trip down to 3rd St. worthwhile.\n\nOne of the bartenders/owners/proprietors helped us throughout the night, kept us stocked with fresh wine glasses and carafes of water, and gave us good suggestions on wines and tasting order.  We weren't a small group, and the attentiveness of the service was noteworthy.  He said he got the idea for Yield from his years of working at Millennium.   We started with a french white blend called 'Arrogant Frog'.   Heh.  By far, the highlight of the evening was a Porter Creek Syrah that came well-recommended.\n\nTwo minor issues:\n\n1) From when we walked in, up until midnight, the place was insanely hot and humid, to the point where the windows were entirely fogged up and several of my friends commented about how grateful they were when someone would open the front door.

I work at a tech company a few blocks away and have always been a happy customer. Tonight however, I was treated with such incredible rudeness that I was compelled to write. I was there with a large party (prearranged) and was seated with 2 friends at the small bar. After personally spending $50 on a bottle of wine ( generous tip included) my coworkers and I were told that we needed to vacate the bar and the stools we were sitting on for \"paying customers\". When I commented to \"Nick\", the bartender, that we were paying customers he told me that I wasn't  because we were a part of the \"party\" and therefor we \"need to move\". Apparently our party of 20 + who spent well over $500 did not, per Nick, qualify as \"paying\". I asked again and his response was that I could sit but as soon as a \"customer\" came  I had to MOVE!   I waited tables for 10 years and I understand busy but rude and disrespectful  is another story. I will never spend another dime while Nick works there and I will recommend the same to my coworkers.

The wine list was OK, organized well but missing anything I really wanted to try. Then I noticed it at the bottom: \"All of our wines or Organic or Bio-Dynamically Produced.\" My experience with organic wines has been, well, bad, so my heart sunk a bit when I read that. They did however have a Chardonnay from China on the menu so I figured it *had* to be good since they went out of their way to taste it, order it, and bravely put it on their menu\n\nBut it wasn't. It was *terrible*. Completely undrinkable. Why would you put such a horrible wine on your menu at a wine bar? I hope the people that run this joint ask themselves that very question.\n\nAll in all we had five different wines and I got to taste a bit of all of them. The Cabernet Franc, Zinfandel, & Cava were all OK. All were watery and unbalanced. The Syrah was the best of the group. The Cava had a strong yeast flavor and was not satisfying.  Sigh.

In a good way. We exchanged an email, then he picked up the phone and called me! That's right - HE CALLED ME! None of that silly back-and-forth email business. He just picked up the phone. We worked out a great deal on plenty of food for 20 guests, and he offered to cut and serve the cake I was planning on bringing. I knew it was going to be good.\n\nWhen we showed up on the big night, Nick was there - and he was just as great as Chris! In fact, Nick doted on us all night! And not in a creepy way! He kept checking in with me, to make sure everything was going well. He kept the delicious food coming out at perfectly timed intervals. He made suggestions for how to lower the cost of our drinks a bit (just buy the bottle! it's way cheaper!). And, the piece de resistance - he went out and bought candles for the cake!

There's something to be said about not having to circle for 20 minutes.\n2) Interior. It's got the understated glamor of Bourbon and Branch mixed with the romantic noir of Hotel Biron\n3) Plenty of space. I've never been there when it's full. It's always comfortably active, and you don't have to fall over other people to get a table.\n4) Wines with purpose. I don't know any of the wines on the list, but they're all grown bio-dynamically. Drinking wine here feels like driving a prius up 101 in the carpool lane during rush hour. Ok, maybe not, but it still means you get a very interesting list of wines.\n5) The Chocolate plate.

Most of the time, wine lists seem to overlook these two types in favor of Cabs (which are fine), Merlots, and Zins (which I am not a fan of). We ordered a bottle of the RDLR Syrah from Mendocino - very nice wine with hints of \"smoked pomegranate and leather.\" And for $36, it didn't break the bank. Lovely.\n\nWhat I was really impressed with was the service. There were at least two guys circling the area - picking up empty wine glasses, checking water levels (they gave us our own glass water bottle so we could refill as needed) and making sure that we were all having a good time. At no point did we have to go flag someone down. It seems like a lot of times, small places tend to understaff - especially in remote places like where this was located.

Boone's \"wines\" are the non-ironic 40's of middle class suburban white kids...we used to buy them with our fake ID's and then listen to Coolio in our parent's beamers.  Hardcore.

THAT FLAT BREAD WAS MY JAM, YO!  The salad without pancetta was also DELICIOUS...spinach and raisins and all manners of delight for the tongue.  Clearly the chefs here knows what they are doing in the vegan food department (I think the former Millennium wine guy is the owner?) and so it is with this claim that I strongly urge Yield to go 100% VEGAN IN THE SNACKS DEPARTMENT!

Because there were no desserty options for me, I had to bring and consume massive amounts of my own candy.  I would not have over indulged to the point of sickness if a dessert of a reasonable portion size were on the menu.  Please, for my health (and yours?), consider this.  \n\nAnd finally, the reasons you should ask me out on a date are as follows:  I am very demanding with unreasonable requests, I have no self control, and I have one foot that is significantly larger than the other due to a freaky and, as of yet, unexplained disorder.

Ladies, did I mention there's a chocolate plate available?\nThe guys running the place are adorable, knowledgeable, and very friendly. The crowd was almost nonexistent, which is the reason I am urging you all to head over to Yield. This is definitely a place we want staying open. \nThe interior is masculine, with solid wood-block tables and low-slung overstuffed leather and suede seats. The tables are narrow and low, allowing for audible conversation with your drinking companions.\nThere is an additional room with small bar tables, candles all over the place, and a kind of romantic vibe. \nWe loved it and you will too. But if you're hungry, order a cheese plate or flatbread from the kitchen early- I think the kitchen closes around 10 and there is no place in that hood that you want to be eating at 11 p.m.", "author": "Autumn K."}

The noise -- I find it really difficult to have a conversation in there. The price -- I'm not frugal by any means, but I can't seem to wrap my head around spending around $15 a glass. They should really add more decent, mid-priced wines. The staff -- Certainly nice enough, but not really very warm (though I think this is because they're just really busy. But still -- it contributes to the overall, kind of unfriendly vibe I get in here). And, though I admit this is so nitpicky, Yield doesn't allow you to bring in a cake for someone's bday. Let me note that I am only aware of this policy because my friend had her bday gathering there, and they very graciously made an exception for her because she's a regular (though they made it clear that she's an exception). Now, if they specialized in desserts, I would totally get this. But this policy strikes me as just a tad bitchy for the rest of us non-regulars.

And the other half minus star is for the bathroom with the large door opening up right into the side room. at least take that big blue industrial toilet sign off the door.", "author": "Nikki F."}

(i know this is grossly overdue.)  with wine's described as approachable and a staff eager to recommend vintages, it's a great place to chill out.   we had the olives and cheese plate, which were quite enjoyable.  we were the first one's in there and by the time we left the place it was packed even on a dreary rainy day.", "author": "Sharlene C."}

The parking is easy, the atmosphere is casual yet cool, the wine is great (and organic so it is good for you!) and the owner is so sweet that you just want so badly for him to succeed. Best wine bar in the city (and yes... I've been to Hidden Vine)", "author": "Michelle D."}

So i order the cheese plate to go with my flight of, might i add, amazing wines.  And they're out of apples, my substitute for bread with cheese.   Unbeknownst to us, the server (who turns out to be THE OWNER) runs to the corner store.  He then brings us a plate of amazing cheese, with sliced apple.  It was amazing.  And, they comp'd us a glass of champagne at the end of the night when we were curious how it tasted.  Very chill, tasty wine, i'll definitely be back.", "author": "andrea w."}

The place looks like it could be ground zero for the neighborhood flip that will likely happen in lower potrero/dogpatch over the next year.  The owner (Chris) is very friendly.  Highly recommended.", "author": "Kelly D."}
