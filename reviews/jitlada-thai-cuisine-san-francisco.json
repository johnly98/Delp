I really loved the texture of the noodles in the pad kee mao. In the green curry, the chicken was perfectly done, I just wish there was a little less coconut milk and more green curry taste, and it's really hard to go with any eggplant dish so no complaints there.\n\nNext time I'll definitely want to try out the tom yum soup since that's usually my go to dish, but for now I feel like the three dishes that I got are a good sign that this place is a solid choice to go with if you're craving Thai food.", "author": "Gita r."}

Actually it's been about 17 years according to their website with the same chef/owner, Chef Pai, who comes from Thailand where she learned all her cooking techniques. In other words, there ain't no fusion confusion here. Consequently it was never the 'it' place to go to among the Yelperati, rather a warhorse that has survived its semi-hidden location on Buchanan while fashion-forward ramen and BBQ eateries rise and fall.\n\nI came here after a long lapse since my last visit for a late dinner and found it empty except for one large, loud group of young Asian women who were grousing about the lack of quality men in the city. I told them they might have better luck opening Grindr accounts. OK, I didn't but I felt like sharing that 'Sleepless in Seattle' statistic where they concluded they had a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than getting married. But back to me as I ordered the $9 Bangkok Salad, a refreshing mix of greens, cashews, carrots, tomatoes, and cucumber slices, all of the ingredients tossed in a soy sesame vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/2Mg0Uos).\n\nIt was delicious but not quite enough to stand alone for my pronounced appetite, so I ordered the $13 Sam-Sa-Hai, a plate of chicken, saut\u00e9ed baby corn, zucchini, mushrooms, snow peas, red peppers, scallions, and cashews in their house special ginger sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2MkYc0Z). I think what separated this dish from normal stir fries was the piquant flavor of the ginger, obviously something Chef Pai has perfected over the years and hasn't changed since. And why should she? I don't think she's gunning for another Michelin Star like Kin Khao. I think it's fine the way it is. But jeez, get a Grindr account, will ya?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good, no-fuss traditional Thai dishes\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...would-be quiet spot except for the cacophonous gaggle of girls\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very quiet and attentive despite the noise\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I need to remember to come back more often", "author": "Ed U."}

The staff was fairly attentive, but there was a time when my friend made eye contact with a server and they pretended not to notice. The staff was really nice and helpful when we asked for peanut sauce and hot sauce. We got the trout in banana leaf and the pad Thai. The trout was AMAZING- the meat was grilled to perfection and just melted into your mouth. The vegetables it came with were cooked in the same sauce the fish was covered with. We ate this with the hot sauce and it was really good. The hot sauce wasn't too spicy, but added just the right kick to our food. The pad Thai was our safe dish, just in case we didn't like the trout so we had something to fall back on. It was good but my friend ordered peanut sauce to go with it because he didn't think it was peanut-y enough. I thought it was good, but generally prefer milder peanut flavors than him. It came with some bean sprouts and shaved carrots on the side. Both dishes came with lime which we squeezed onto the fish. They also have two Thai beers, one is the Singha which we got and was a good complement to the fish and pad Thai. Would go back, the food was good. Their bathroom is inside the kitchen, so while walking by we noticed the unique and clean kitchen as well. Check it out if you can", "author": "Kulmeher D."}

The soup came out first and it wasn't anything too impressive for me.  I thought that there were too many inedible ingredients inside, and that filtering those things out might have made that experience better.  The pad see ew tasted pretty standard for me, and the evil princess curry was also pretty standard.  I was a bit scared of the spiciness levels, so we opted to get medium spiciness on the curry, but it wasn't very spicy so I'd recommend opting for a hotter option if you love spicy things like me!\n\nOverall, I thought the food was pretty average/OK, but the prices were definitely a bit high for the food quality.

I like my pad thai to have a more brownish color and have a more savory flavor too.  One thing it did have going for it was that it was full of chicken - a little too much for me, but hey at least it had a lot.\n\nRED CURRY: really flavorful and super coconut-y.

We loved it!\n\nFor an entree got the pad kee mao ($11) with beef. The flavors were so savory and again you could really taste the basil which was great! The flat thick noodles were cooked so well. It's a large serving size and you could share this dish alone with another person and be full. The other entree we got was the yellow curry ($11) with chicken. Wow this was the highlight of the meal for me. A bit spicy but perfectly flavored and hit the spot. Loved how soft the potatoes were. Unfortunately it doesn't come with rice so we ordered a bowl for an extra $2.", "author": "Linda X."}

Yes, should not be promoted as prawn at all. \n\nSom Tum: Meh.... usually som tom is spicy, fiah saucy with fragrant lime and cilantro. Their dish was on the sweet side. What's unusual though, they have shrimp in it.\n\nJungle Curry: My husband like it. I'm not that crazy. Maybe I did not read the menu correctly, but I though curry comes with coconut milk. \n\nPad Kee Mao: We had chicken pad kee mao. It was yummy.

You choose the level of spiciness--I like medium, which is still spicy but not runny nose spicy.  Boyfriend and I agree that this just might be the best Thai curry we've ever had.  Highly recommended!\n\nMango w/black sticky rice: it's actually purple rice, and the mango is sliced very thinly to have perfect bite-sized portions along with the rice, $5.50.  Love the relatively unique rice, which makes it not taste quite as sweet as other places, and lends to varying textures in each bite.  It's also served on a banana leaf (even delivery), which is a nice touch.\n\nPad ka prow: stir fried bell peppers, onions, basil, and green beans with choice of meat (I recommend ground chicken), $9.95.

(After spending a few weeks backpacking there I have become a totally self-righteous expert on authentic Thai food so this gives me great authority to judge this stuff ok.) My coworker said I have to try Jitlada. \"It's the best.\" She proclaimed.\n\nI raced over after work and selected a few dishes to go: Khao Soi, stuff eggplant, and papaya salad. While waiting for my food I was chatting with the owner, she was super nice and smiled patiently as I practiced the four Thai words I know. She was a trooper for what must have been complete cultural butchery on my part.\n\nI asked for the papaya salad to be \"Thai spicy\", AKA try to kill me spicy. \n\nUpon arrival at home and after excitedly opening the bag of food a few things occurred:\n\n1. The stuffed eggplant tasted great, maybe a bit small but oh well.\n\n2. The papaya salad had what I'd consider to be a mild amount of spice. (Mind you I'm not one of those crazy people who brush their teeth with ghost peppers, I just like a kick to my papaya salad.) Other than that, quite good.\n\n3. This one was the red flag: they used linguine pasta noodles in the Khao Soi. When I saw this my heart sank. All my other nit-picky complaints were minor, but this was just completely weird to me. I've never seen this and it is a source of total confusion. Did they run out of the traditional and universally common flat egg noodles? Are pasta noodles cheaper? Is the world about to end?

The flavors are definitely toned down for the American palate (unlike the Thai places in Thai Town LA) but still delicious. The Crying Tiger could've used a bit more of a kick. I thought it was odd that the noodles in the Khao Soi were linguine but I suppose it tasted alright. The red curry had a disproportionate amount of  veggies compared to meat but my friend enjoyed it, nonetheless.

Just off the main square by the Peace Pagoda in Japan town, Jitlada is set back from traffic in a quiet little storefront. The inside is clean and nicely furnished with an eye for comfort- no sardine seating here!\n\nThe food struck that sweet spot between savory and spicy thanks to the waitress allowing us to customize our spiciness level. Tom Kha Gai soup often ends up too sour or too watery, but Jitlada gets it just right with the coconut milk to lemongrass ratio, rich and full of mushrooms and chicken. The curries are flavorful and complex, and the seafood fresh. The only pitfall is the overall sweetness of the sauces. American palates tend to favor sweeter dishes than I like, so it's probably just fine for the average fan of Thai food.\n\nOverall, the prices were reasonable for San Francisco, and the service was just fine, ten minutes for apps and ten more for entrees. The waitstaff was kind and attentive about drinks and additional service. I'll definitely be back. \n\nMom-n-Pop establishments move at an easy pace, so if you are crunched for time or are a super control freak, maybe hit McDonalds or something instead of taking it out on the waitstaff, eh?", "author": "Emily H."}

And I went to school in a city with pretty great Thai food, so I have pretty high standards.\n\nI recommend getting a curry with rice, as all of the curries I've had have been delicious. Of all the curries I've tried, green curry is my favorite. It's really flavorful and thick with a nice hint of coconut. If spicy food is your thing, get the Evil Princess Curry, which is spicy and savory. It's unlike any other curry I've tried so far. The Red Curry is also delicious, though a bit on the salty side. I have yet to try the noodles, but my friends have had good things to say about the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew (I think the Pad See Ew might go by a different name, though). Portions are very generous and prices are quite reasonable.\n\nService is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is calm and cozy (like the rest of Japantown, except when there's ramen/JPop festivals).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-02", "description": "Came here after reading that one of our favorite Thai food places had a terrible health score. This one had a good score and the reviews were pretty fair. This place blew my wife and me away. The location was tucked away near Japan town in a very charming neighborhood, you'd almost never notice it. Inside reminded me of a coffee shop, the tables were well organized (not too cramped). Our service was great, we didn't need a reservation and were immediately seated on a Friday around 6:30. The restaurant was a little more than half full.\n\nWe ordered the shrimp in sleeping bags, Tom ka soup to share both as appetizers. For our mains we ordered combination fried rice and the house noodles with shrimp. This was so much food; it's family style apparently, never a bad thing. For dessert we ordered the sticky rice.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nShrimp in sleeping bags - excellent crispy, good flavor; although, a little more shrimpy than I normally like. Sauce was perfectly sweet and spicy.\nTom ka - perfect consistency, nice balance of coconut milk and water, not too creamy. Was a bit salty but still delicious.\nHouse noodle (added baby corn) - wow\nFried rice w/ shrimp and chicken - best fried rice ever, wow\nMango sticky rice - more wow\n\n\nThe end.", "author": "James M."}

On our initial visit, a friend and I conversed with our server and by chance segued into asking if the restaurant had a particular traditional Thai ingredient. We described it and showed her photos of it. She said they had it but that one of the workers had already taken the rest of it home that day. She and we decided it would be best for us to call ahead next time to check before coming in to try it.\n\nThe next week, I called about the item. The person who answered initially didn't understand my English (not a problem). I elaborated on my inquiry, at which point she said they don't [ever] have it and began laughing right before hanging up. It's not like I called to ask if their refrigerator was running or if I could talk to I. P. Freely.\n\nSome friends and I happened to be in Japantown later that day. The one who accompanied me on my first Jitlada visit walked over to ask in person, just in case the phone conversation had been a language barrier thing. Well, she asked and was subsequently laughed / argued out of the restaurant with, from what she told me, all the patrons watching.\n\nFrom my Thai friends and the Thai crew I used to run with, my impression of Thai culture is that it's looser, more relaxed than that of America. Yet I don't see openly laughing at - not with - someone and in this manner driving them out of a place as being part of any culture's joviality. Maybe I just don't know.\n\nAgain, we like the menu, and we want to explore it more. We even don't mind the moths that make evening cameos around the table. Yet I'm not sure when or if my friend would be up for going back after her experience. I think you should still eat here, so long as you don't try to go off-menu. Or if you do ask about other items, bring one of your Thai friends to helm the conversation in your stead.", "author": "Dan B."}

Didn't really enjoy the barbecue chicken that the waitress recommended.\n\nAt the end, no signs posted, the waitress said the credit card machine was broken and asked us to pay cash. She even did a whole song-and-dance, even pulling the age card, saying doing the manual credit card imprinting was \"very hard\" for her, and did an arm motion to show how strenuous it was to operate the device (despite being able to carry around several heavy dishes at once...).

At lunch, they do have bento box style specials where you can try a little bit of a everything (appetizer, salad, rice, entree). Normally the dishes here are more family size servings, especially for dinner. We had fun ordering a bunch of different things and sharing. \n\nMy favorite part of this restaurant is that you can smell the food cooking from the street and it seduces you in through the front door.

Red curry with spinach, cabbage, bell pepper, bamboo shoot, coconut milk and choice of beef. The beef was a bit tough, but the curry was perfect. Great balance of coconut milk in the curry.

The only regret I have is not asking for spicier. \n\nI went here on a Wednesday after work with a friend, we ordered the Ginger Shrimp roll and the Chicken Satay to start. The Chicken Satay is large skewers of chicken with peanut sauce, I was pretty impressed by the quality of meat.  \n\nThe Evil Princess curry is a spicy red curry, definitely seemed to be a popular choice. Of course, a meal with only one curry is not a meal, so we also tried the Gaeng Keaw Wan (green curry) with Chicken. This was easily my favorite dish of the night, extremely flavorful with green beans and eggplant. I can still taste it now!\n\nThe best part was it didn't seem like people knew about it, the restaurant was only half full on a wednesday evening. So if you're looking for a quiet spot for some great Thai food, Jitlada is the spot. \n\nI'll eat here over Osha any day.", "author": "Brad M."}

It's a red curry dish and I ordered it with chicken and asked for extra spicy. It had nice flavors, and they use chicken breast meat. Brown rice is an extra $2.50 (WTF?). Service is good. Ice water was cold (sorry for that one). Extra spicy had some kick to it.\n\nIt's next to an OPTH and OPTOM office.

Thai food in Japantown!? \n\nMy girlfriend and I decided that we didn't want Japanese food (again) despite being in the heart of Japantown, but luckily we found this well-hidden spot. \n\nWe were a little skeptical and debating if it was going to be a \"nearby mall convince-type\" restaurant or an actualy \"legitimate\" thai joint. \n\nPapaya Salad [http://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NwSYhuy3eTYzTmsD8ziswg/l.jpg]\nEh, nothing truly to rave about. Just like any other papaya salad with the standard little kick of spiciness from the chilies. The salad was served in a wonton cup but because of all the juices, it was soggy in most areas. \n\nEvil Princess Curry [http://s3-media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s12z2FUlaRYA1eqNGAt-Mg/l.jpg]\nI thought that only ordering just 1 appetizer and 1entree wouldn't be enough but I'm glad I didn't second guess myself. This curry dish was huge! A ton of spinach, chicken, and various other veggies. However, the curry texture itself was watery and I could hardly taste any \"thai spices\" within. I'm sorry to say that I had more flavorful curries at King of Thai.. \n\nRoti with Coconut Ice Cream [http://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dGRJ7TIcDMTk6bdF2AfZPw/l.jpg]\nIt was a little odd when I saw that there was a face made of nuts and raisins on my ice cream and reminded me of how Belly Good Crepes (within Japantown Center) does the same. The Roti itself wasn't all that great -- It was bland and it wasn't warm enough to really blend the ice cream together. We asked for some condensed milk but I assume that they don't normally serve their Roti with it, so there was none at all.\n\n\nSo, Jitlada is a nice dimly light restaurant for a quiet dinner, but the food can be a miss. Like most Thai-type restaurants, you have to pay for the rice separately and Jitlada is no different. Our servers were friendly but they seemed very quiet and timid. Jitlada gets an A-OK from me, despite being a tad pricy, I left full and knocked out my non-Japanese dinner for the night, well sorta.", "author": "Albert L."}

After perusing the menu, I decided to try the evil princess -- a red curry with spinach and Napa cabbage. They started the meal off with a Miso soup, which was really flavorful with cilantro and green onion. Then the curry came. If you want rice with it you have to order it separately  (which you should do, because the sauce is delicious). The curry was flavorful, and not too spicy (as a medium). Normally I like my Thai food pretty spicy, but this has such a nice flavor I didn't feel the need to ask for extra chilis. my only complaint was the portion size was too small to split into two meals, but too big for my normal lunch portion.

I arrived about 20 minutes before my dining companions showed and the hostess was nice enough to let me sit at the bar and have a beer while I waited. Our server was also very kind and personable, which makes a dining experience that much better, IMO.\n\nLike many other SF restaurants, Jitlada is small and can only accommodate about 10-12 tables, so I can imagine there is often a wait to be seated. But you can also order your food to-go, as I watched several people pick up their order while I waited at the bar. \n\nIf you want a warm, fuzzy Thai experience, definitely try Jitlada. As many others have mentioned, the food is good but it's the service that makes it worth going back for.", "author": "Abby S."}

Their flavours lean heavily to the sweet side, which can taste very good to some people, but it is not authentic and they are lacking most of the other incredible flavours and seasonings Thai food has. We thought the som tum papaya salad was completely bland, and missing many standard seasonings.\nAlso, the green tea I ordered had very few leaves in the pot among some other things  so as other reviewers have said it seems that they skimp a bit on their offering. We ordered our dishes medium spicy but we couldn't detect any spice at all.", "author": "Dire S."}

Had veggies, the right amount of sauce, and the right amount of spicy. The salad was ... okay.

My favorite dish thus far is hands down the yellow curry.  It is sweet and not too heavy.  If you order in the restaurant, they offer you the choice of brown rice or sticky rice, the latter being more sweet.  Since the curry is sweet as is, I usually go with the brown rice, which becomes a nice vehicle for this awesome curry!  I've also tried the pad see ew (good as well) and pad thai (good, but both this and the pad see ew were pretty standard).  Their mango and sticky rice is pretty bomb too.  It comes with black sticky rice, which is cool, and they even toss in a sliced strawberry (a nice little added bonus).  The mango is always so sweet and juicy.  I love it!\n\nThe service is always good, greeting us with smiles, filling our water glasses constantly, and boxing our food if we have leftovers.

The noodles weren't too greasy or \"sticky\" and the tofu & chicken both tasted good.

Sometimes you'll go to Thai restaurants and they'll have very good pad thai or just very good curries or just very good spicy beef, but Jitlada has a solid menu with many specials that are featured both on their website and in a special insert they put into the menu.  \n\nWhat really kicked off my interest in Jitlada was the pictures of the Emerald noodles I saw on their website and the combination of green spinach noodles, tiger prawns, and a special wasabi sauce really did spark my interest.  Now I actually ended up not ordering that but my friend got it and it looked exactly the same as in the picture.  And based on his opinions, it was very very good too.  Sometimes restaurants will spice up how their dishes look on a menu or website and when you order it, it'll look like something tossed together in a salad mixing bowl but the Emerald noodle dish was spot on.\n\nI got the Paradise pasta with the house special sauce and chicken & that was a wonderful mixture of chicken breast meat, flat thin spinach noodles, veggies, and a sweet red sauce for only $9.95.  Others at my table ordered pumpkin curry, baby back pork ribs, and Chef Pai's BBQ chicken and none of them seemed to disappoint.  So all together, we ordered pretty much most of the menu from noodles to curry to specialty dishes and they were all rock solid and delicious.\n\nTo finish off the meal, I only got a taste of the coconut ice cream and fried banana that my entire table shared but it was SOOOOO good that next time I'm ordering one $5 order for myself and not sharing with nobody!!!  \n\nOn a final note, taking a trip to the restroom gives you a complete tour of Jitlada's kitchen.

It's one of my favorite cuisines, and I'll put up with lackluster Thai because it's still predictably tasty and vegetarian-friendly.\n\nThis restaurant, however, is beyond the standard Thai fare I'm accustomed to in many ways.  The service is not only friendly, but genuinely helpful.  The restaurant staff have a decent command of the English language to provide useful answers to my questions, and more importantly, they are very in sync with each other.  There were no miscommunications, and on a busy night, my food still arrived promptly.\n\nAnd the food... even if it had taken a long time to arrive, it would have been worth the wait.  I had great fun simply pouring over the menu and learning about new Thai dishes I had never heard of before, like the fried curry dumplings (think Thai samosas), and the Evil Princess curry entree.  Being a long-time fan of Indian food as well, I just had to try the samosa-like dumplings, and I ordered the fall seasonal special entree.  I forget what it was called, but it was basically a stir fry of seasonal vegetables, including pumpkin, shiitake mushroom, and whole peas in the pod with cashews in a light, sweet sauce.\n\nI've mentioned that I'm a vegetarian, and that I've put up with mediocre food before.  I also cook my own food at home and know how difficult it can be to prepare vegetables well.  This entree sounds simple, but the vegetables were all expertly cooked.  The pumpkin was not undercooked but not falling apart either, mushrooms were not rubbery but tender and delicious, the peas were light and crisp, and the sauce was not too overbearing and helped the flavor of the vegetables shine.  It was an excellent balance of flavor and texture.\n\nThe price, as well, was very reasonable.  I paid $30 for an entree, an appetizer, and a beer.  While it's not the cheapest Thai food around, I feel the quality and service are at least two notches above the baseline, while the price is just one notch.\n\nThe decor isn't the trendiest around, but it's clean and simple and I can tell a lot of thought was put into it.  The few features were the Buddha statues, which all have their daily offerings of tea, Diet Coke, and toys for baby Buddha, as well as the live orchids lovingly clipped with decorative dragonflies to a support stick.\n\nOverall, the entire restaurant staff has put their heart and soul into this restaurant and the end result is superb.", "author": "Aleta D."}

The Evil Princess was supposed to be spicy but I didn't detect any heat from this bad girl at all so I was a bit disappointed. I guess you'd have to request for spicier when you order it. The Pad Thai hit the spot and wasn't too sweet or tamarind-y, while the Gai Himephan being the most unforgettable. \n\nAll of that and the bill came out to be less than 60 dollars for a group of 4, so we were pretty surprised. The food was great but I did start feeling self-conscious as it was so quiet. I felt like everyone could hear us talk, so everyone became barely audible. Decor is pretty simple but fitting.\n\nGood food and friendly service! In any case, we'll definitely be coming back in the future.", "author": "Vinh N."}

If I want quick Thai food on a night out or for a meal before a movie, that's one thing.  SF has many of those quick and ok places to offer.  If you want good food with feels-like-home kind of service, I cannot name a single Thai restaurant that I can say that about.\n\nWell, that's no longer the case, in my book, about a Thai restaurant with good food and awesome service.  Jitlada has become my favorite Thai restaurant in SF!\n\nI tried Jitlada out because I was in the neighborhood to see a play.  And I will definitely come back, even if I don't have anything to do in that neighborhood.  The food was excellent.  We ordered the Barbecue Pork Ribs which were just so tender and melted in my mouth.  The Pumpkin Curry was as yummy as everyone on yelp raved about.  \n\nThe restaurant staff were extremely friendly and not some high-maintenance servers you see everywhere else.  They even talked us out of ordering too much rice because the Barbecue Pork Ribs come with some sticky rice already.  We were greeted and taken care of throughout the whole dining experience.

I should have known to avoid any restaurant with pictures of the food next to item on the menu. Bad sign right there :(.\n\nCrab wontons were $8 and contained very little crab meat, without much flavor either.\n\nI should also have known to avoid dishes with word like \"Paradise\" in them.

Nothing worked together, flavors were just odd altogether and unrecognizable from any other Thai food I've ever had.\n\nThe \"Khao Soi\"  pasta noodle dish also hit weird notes and was simply unsatisfying. It looked like a Vietnamese-style Pho but with a thick, sickly sweet yellow curry sauce instead of broth. The combination did not work, and I could not stomach the idea of slurping up the almost saccharine curry sauce (seriously, easy on the brown sugar!) as if it were a soup.\n\nI get the feeling the chef here decided to go a bit too far in the \"fusion\" side of things.

We were both feeling hungry, but after chomping down lots of scones from the event, a light lunch seemed in order. I imagined having a refreshing papaya salad, so I was super psyched to go.\n\nOur waitress (or was she the owner?) was extremely friendly and warmly greeted when we entered. She knew my bf's mom and brought out her favorite drink and mango salad almost instantly. \n\nMeanwhile, the dude and I kept perusing the menu for something not too heavy. I stuck with my original idea and ordered the papaya salad - he ordered pad thai. I thought that would be all, but his mom insisted we try some additional dishes, so along with the mango salad, papaya salad and pad thai we also had basil stuffed eggplant and Livia's noodles (pad see ewe with shrimp).\n\nThe two salads were a nicely balanced (sweetness/sourness) and the papaya salad is even served in a tostada type of vessel, topped with prawns. I liked that the flavors of the fruit in both dishes was the main attraction - I love my local Thai restaurants in LA, but I find that they rely heavily on intense fish sauce and spiciness to flavor their salads.\n\nThe basil stuffed eggplant had a really nice aroma of fresh herbs as it arrived at our table. I instantly thought of Italian food. Inside the eggplant was a type of sausage that I thought was perhaps chicken, but no one at the table agreed with me. It had a slightly bouncy and spongy texture, but it went well with the eggplant and basil sauce.\n\nThe pad thai was sweet and rich, again, no super duper heavy flavors, which I liked. Lastly, the pad see ewe (Livia's noodles) had that delightfully addictive smoky flavor I can't get enough of. If we hadn't stuffed ourselves full of raspberry scones and Cytomax energy drinks immediately after the race, I'm sure every plate on the table would have been cleared off.", "author": "Davey G."}

The second dish was an eggplant creation with tofu and other vegetables --- it was also quite good and generously portioned.

Really though it's more like one and a half more stars.\n\nThe service was phenominal once again with our hostess making an excellent suggestion to try the Jungle Curry, and specifying that it is better accompanied by beef or chicken rather than tofu.  Anne Marie and I opted for the beef as we were also going to be having the spicy basil chicken.  Both of these dishes went well with the brown rice.  As an appetizer we started off with their ginger shrimp rolls.  The ginger flavor was a unique touch to the rolls and went great with the silver noodles and shrimp.  It was all the more tasty with the great sauce they serve it with.\n\nI need to come back here more often.", "author": "Luis M."}

So we did, and I have to say it didn't disappoint, although it was way less spicy than I thought it would be. In fact, the Pad Kee Mao we ordered was the surprise spicy dish. Who knew? \n\nBut both dishes were excellent and were a lot of food, and the place was small and pretty cool. This little Thai restaurant is why I love Yelp. I would have never even known it existed, because I'm never in this part of the city, but zing here it is!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-09-28", "description": "I find it ironic that right after I write a review praising the hallmarks of good customer service (read my review of Ann Taylor on Post St.), I am disappointed to report that I received anything but good service during a recent dining experience at Jitlada Thai Cuisine.\r\n\r\nI made reservations for a party of 8 last Friday to have dinner before heading over to catch a screening of the film Red Doors (by the way, it's a great film -- go see it if you haven't already!).  I made the reservations for a full 2 hours before the start of the movie to ensure that we had plenty of time to order, eat, and walk the 5 short blocks to the theater afterwards.  Our food arrived nearly an hour after we placed our order, but that was merely one instance in a series of poor service we experienced throughout the night.  As for the rest, where do I begin?\r\n\r\nAfter our party arrived (on time) at the restaurant, we were seated at a long, cramped table in the corner.  One friend was an unexpected late addition, and she stood for nearly 15 mins before someone brought over an extra chair.  All the while, the lady behind the register was chatting/flirting with a take-out customer right in front of her!  \r\n\r\nThe woman who took our order was an older lady with a snappy, know-it-all attitude, who rarely smiled.  Very unpleasant.  One of my friends is vegan, so naturally, she had some questions about how the food was prepared.  Every time she started asking a question, our server cut her off and assured that the kitchen would make her dish \"without meat.\"  \r\n\r\nOur server was also very pushy.  She tried to sneak in an appetizer that no one ordered.  When we told her we wanted to dine \"family style\" and ordered a total of 8 entrees (to split between the 9 of us), she complained that we didn't order enough dishes.  She informed us in a haughty tone of voice that she was willing to \"let us do it this time,\" but \"just so we know in the future\" it is house policy to order at least as many dishes as the number of people dining.  \r\n\r\nFirst of all, let me point out that nowhere on the menu does it state such a \"policy.\"  And secondly, there will be no \"future\" visits.  I mean, what a stupid thing to say in front of a large party!  At our table were 9 customers, all of whom she just made very uncomfortable.  Moreover, she just lost 9 potential returning customers who will NOT likely be coming back after the horrible treatment we just received.  I had read all these positive reviews on Yelp about what a delightful person Chef Pai is.  I sincerely hope this woman is not Chef Pai!\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, several of the dishes we ordered were inventive.  The stuffed basil eggplant appetizer, the pumpkin curry, and the evil princess were all delicious.  That being said, there is NO EXCUSE for rude, pushy service.  For that reason, I will not be going back.  And for the same reason, Jitlada Thai Cuisine deserves no more than 2 stars.", "author": "Annie W."}

Service is extremely friendly and warm. You know the wait staff that look so stressed they could break down at any minute? You won't find anyone like that here. Waitresses at Jitlada are like calm sweet kindergarten teachers that are only capable at whispering, never yelling. \n\nThree of us ordered the sea bass, khao soi, and jungle curry to share. Khao soi was my favorite. It's a perfect balance of curry and sweetness in a bowl of soupy thick noodles. The taste is quite addicting; you just keep on feeding yourself one spoonful after another. \n\nThe sea bass had good flavors, but fish is a bit overdone. Come to think of it, I have always had this problem in Thai restaurants where the protein tends to be over cooked. That's why I often rather order the dishes vegetarian than to eat dry chicken in otherwise lovely curries. \n\nI didn't quite care for the Jungle curry. My friend claimed it to be super healthy, since it takes away the \"evil\" coconut milk that is, of course, packed with like a thousand calories. But I am not sure if I can enjoy Thai curry dishes without the coconut milk. Without the thickness of coconut milk, Jungle curry resembled more like a soup, which is so not good for pouring over rice to consume. \n\nAmbiance is nice and quiet, and the price is slightly more expensive than your Thai restaurant next door, about $20 a person (we didn't have dessert and only one of us ordered a glass of wine.)", "author": "Candice B."}

This is not a good place for authentic Thai food. I've lived in Asia and been to Thailand and I think that this food is very Americanized. It's certainly okay and can serve as an introduction to Thai food. If you're a real foodie or serious fan of Thai food I would look elsewhere. My experience is a that a lot of Thai restaurants are afraid of spicing up their food because many Americans are not used to it and complain about it. A better value is San Wang Restaurant nearby at Post and Buchanan. It's an interesting Chinese - Korean no - nonsense type of place that gives good value for flavorful food.", "author": "Dr. Hans Z."}

I'd never even heard of this dish before our trip, read some random aside in a guide book saying that while in Chiang Mai to \"eat as much of this dish as humanly possible\", took em up on that offer, and now I can't get it out of my head. It's amazing. Think back to that that very first time you ate pad thai and realized that a noodle dish could taste like that (sweet AND savory AND spicy at the same time?? holy smokes.), and that's how I feel with Khao Soi - that there's this awesome dish that's out there and all this time I haven't been eating it has been wasted time, and it's now my obligation to make up for said time. \n\nAnyways, when I found out that this little Thai joint near our neighborhood had it on the menu, I was unbelievably stoked and made my wife and friends go with me there tonight to sample their khao soi. And it was... pretty ok. Too thick on the coconut milk, not enough spice to it, a little heavy handed on the noodle to broth ratio. Khao soi snobbery? I'll entertain that, but it doesn't change my disappointment in dinner tonight. I noticed the same trend from the khao soi carried over into their other dishes as well - minimal heat and too much onto the sweet side. Everything was sorta band (with regards to Thai food, since you gotta recalibrate for that), despite really fresh looking ingredients.\n\nTo keep things short (or at least short-er), here's a list of pros and cons.\nPros:\n- Khao soi on the menu\n- Nice white table cloths\n- Clean\n- Fresh ingredients\n- Good sized portions\n\nCons:\n- Reaaaaallly slow service (not just on the dishes, but on things like drinks, condiments, etc.), especially considering the place was pretty much empty\n- All of our items (papaya salad, pad see ew, khao soi, green curry) were on the sweet/bland side, just didn't have any excitement to it", "author": "Ron S."}

They told us that if we could get there by a certain time they would stay open and serve us.  It was awesome!  With a group this large we were there for a long time which meant they were there much later than normal.  They did not rush us and took great care of us.  \n\nLast week my boyfriend and I ate dinner there.  There was an issue with the charge that they charged to my credit card.  I won't drone on with the long detail of the story but the bottom line is they were super nice when I called, they called me back to follow up, and genuinely cared about making sure that things were correct on my card. Things happen so I wasn't hung up on what actually happened and if it was their mistake or whatever.  I cared about how it was handled :)", "author": "McKenzie M."}

They came covered in a sticky, sweet barbecue sauce, with the meat so tender it was literally falling off the bone.  See, I've read that phrase a hundred times on menus everywhere and reviews here on Yelp, but this is the first time I've actually eaten ribs that were worthy of that description.  YUM! It also came with this sweet, sticky coconut rice which I thought was delicious as well. It was very similar to a Filipino sticky rice delicacy called \"suman\". \n\nThe restaurant itself was decorated like a cozy little caf\u00e9, with white interiors, floral curtains, and picture frames dotting the walls. Soft, calming music played in the background, similar to what you would hear in a spa while you're getting a massage. It is tiny though, and although we went on a Tuesday night, the place was full, with diners coming in even at the relatively late (for a weekday, anyway) hour of 9 PM. So if you're coming on a weekend I suggest calling ahead for reservations. For the appetizer we ordered the combination satay skewers. It came with 6 skewers of chicken, beef and shrimp on a bed of salad greens. They were good, and the peanut sauce was much tastier than others I've had in the past, but overall this was your regular Thai satay dish, nothing to be blown away by. Other than the fact that it took our waitress about 15 minutes to get us the check after we asked, service was good (food came promptly, water glasses were refilled regularly), and I have to give props to our waitress for recommending the ribs over the yellow curry to me. She said I could get the curry in any other Thai place, and I'm so glad I followed her advice!", "author": "Darbie D."}

Jitlada's the best of the bunch so far, but I wouldn't call it exemplary.\n\nThree of us attacked this place with high expectations from its almost hidden location and 4.5-star Yelp rating.  Our very pleasant waiter was able to seat us promptly, but seemed a bit confused when he took our order.  Five minutes later, with the same lost look, he came back to apologetically alert us to their lack of wide rice noodles.  (Incidentally, is there some sort of citywide quota on the damn things? I've been to three Thai restaurants here that were out.)  I eventually sent him away with my second-choice selection as well as a preemptive request for hot sauce, and our order came within a reasonable time ... sans hot sauce.  I asked again.  Affirmation.  No hot sauce.  Asked yet again.  Affirmation.  No hot sauce.  It finally showed up after I was about 3/4ths of the way through my meal.\n\nSpeaking of the meals, the three of us had differing reactions to our food.  N looked like he was about to swear everlasting fealty to his baby back ribs.  L and I shared our non-carnivorous dishes family style, and while she seemed pleased with the both the eggplant and the tofu pumpkin curry, I had mixed feelings.  The eggplant was fresh and the sauce wasn't super greasy (a huge plus in my book), but it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi.  The tofu pumpkin curry was very delicately spiced, which stood in direct opposition to its heavy cream load.  I can't fault the quality of ingredients or preparation, but the results seemed a bit too nondescript.\n\nThe place as a whole is more good than bad, healthily on this side of mediocre.  I'll go back until I find something better in this town.", "author": "Susuk L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-10", "description": "This place was recommended by a friend who lived in Thailand, so I figured it was worth a try. A group of us went there last night without a reservation. It's a small place and was fairly crowded (note to self: make a reservation on a Saturday night next time), but they cheerfully managed to make a table for us. The service was fantastic - the women there were really friendly and attentive, and they were also funny. The waiter 'carded' my father (who is in his 80's) when he ordered a beer, and she did it with such a straight face that he almost fell for it!\n\nThe menu is lengthy which always worries me - when a place has too much on the menu, I wonder if they can execute all of it well. So we ordered almost exclusively from the \"specials\" menu. The only exception was the pumpkin curry, since I was already told to try it. \n\nWe had mango salad, Larb Gai, and curry puffs as appetizers to share. All of these were fresh and delicious! The salads were crispy, filled with a variety of vegetables, and the flavors were nicely balanced. The curry puffs weren't greasy and were mild but tasty. Larb is one of my favorites, so I was happy to find a great one. We ordered it \"medium\" spicy, and it had a great kick but didn't blow our heads off - perfect!\n\nThe scallops and eggplant main course is really unusual. I've never eaten anything quite like it before. It was delicious, although the peanut sauce did overwhelm the delicate flavor of the scallops a bit. The sea bass was nicely-prepared and also a bit unusual for Thai food. The pumpkin curry was as-advertised by other Yelp reviewers - luscious and totally worth returning for! \n\nThey offer white rice, brown rice, and sticky rice. We all chose sticky rice, which comes in individual servings wrapped in banana leaves. It was delicious. The restaurant also serves quite nice white wines - better than one usually finds in Thai restaurants. The black sticky rice with mango was fantastic (even though the waitress apologized that the mangos weren't totally in season and weren't as good as they like to serve - they weren't stringy and were beautifully prepared.

The description \"Spicy red curry sauce with coconut milk, napa cabbage, and spinach.\"   The darn thing isn't even spicy, it's sweet.  Who would make Red Curry sweet, guess Jitlada Thai does.  I asked for the sticky rice and they charged for that without tell me.  The sticky rice they make is for dessert, not with the main meal, cause that was sweet too.  If they added coconut milk to it I wouldn't have been wiser.  Thus, I asked for white rice they charged $2 for a bowl of white rice. $2.50 for the sticky rice.  I could understand the extra charge for the white rice but charging for the sticky rice without tell me that just wrong.  My wife ordered the Pad Pring Khing.  When the order arrived with 3 lemon slices that were paper thin.  We were surprised beyond belief.  I don't like sour but Pay Pring Khing isn't any good with out lemon in it.  Both dishes were bland.  For my white brothers, you may enjoy this place if you can't handle spicy Thai food but for my Asian brothers look else where for your Thai fix.

Maybe it's just me - judging from the other raves here - but I was not impressed. Yes, the service is VERY friendly and helpful, as others say. But the food didn't taste like anything special to me.\nWhy is it Thai places in San Francisco all seem to serve stuff that is so sweet and mild? I've never been to Thailand, but in other cities Thai places I have been to serve food that is nice and SPICY. I have always read that the food in Thailand is rather spicy, also. So what gives? Do they just decide that SF people can't handle heat? I mean, the Indian and Chinese places in the city serve dishes that are quite spicy compared to most other cities, so it's not as if San Franciscans don't enjoy spicy cuisine.\nAny way, Jitlada's food was fresh and nicely presented. I had the \"spicy\" red duck curry with mangos and string beans. Nothing spicy about it, but it had a nice flavour. My friend had a cashew chicken dish that was just OK. We had 2 appetizers: 1) chicken satay - nothing special and the peanut sauce was WAY too sweet, 2) something called \"curry puffs\" - the menu described these as filled with chicken curry and potatoes. The potatoes were mashed, however - not cubed as I expected. This overwhelmed any other flavours. They were kind of like samosas filled with mashed potatoes - not recommended!\nI agree with the others that the staff here was really sweet, but sadly the food was TOO sweet also.\nIt's not as if the meal was bad - it just tasted like Thai food at any of a half dozen other Thai restaurants around town I've tried. The place is hidden if you aren't looking for it. We were the only two customers at 8:00 on a Friday night. So maybe it is worth a shot if you don't want to wait and enjoy the mild/sweet style of Thai. Prices were reasonable. The decor was awful, not very exotic or pretty at all - which I have noticed seems to be another hallmark of San Francisco Thai restaurants.", "author": "David C."}

The food was excellent, the menu well thought-out with many options, and the overall ambiance and service experience was comfortable.  \n\nMy only complaint?  None of the curry dishes included rice, which was conveniently sold for $2 extra per cup.  Now, don't most curry dishes all but require rice?  Then why is it not included?  Jitlada probably would have gotten another star from me tho w/o the fast-move they're pulling on the rice front...\n\nBut overall Jitlada was a nice experience.  The curry I got was very unique and truly excellent, and overall I liked the place.  I'd recommend it to friends in town, but caution them to not get too excited about the prices until they factor in the over-priced rice...", "author": "Sam S."}

My friends complained that the fried batter, which contains some coconut shreds, was not crispy enough, but I enjoyed it along with the sweet dipping sauce that was provided.\n\nI had the jungle curry, which was so spicy that I had to steal a few sips of my friend's Thai iced tea. When that failed, I ran to the bathroom to scrape my tongue. I would recommend it if you like spicy food and/or tongue scrapes. \n\nMy friend ordered the steak, which was prepared in a delicately sweet sauce. The portion was not large, but was a good size.\n\nDessert was mango and sticky rice, which was elegantly presented and tasted good as well.\n\nNormally four stars, but they lose a star because they took a while to bring food out to us.

I had the tofu and he had the chicken curry. We both liked our dishes, it was very creamy smooth, mild, and looked nice. We also had the fried corn appetizer, which was ok, it comes with mini cuke slices over a little sauce to dip in. He had Thai iced tea, which I took a sip of, and as a person who generally loves the stuff, I'd say it was very good. I just had basic tea, I didn't think to ask about flavors, but it was fine. She refilled my cup halfway through dinner, and it was a nice sized cup. We skipped dessert since we were quite full and had a party to get to. Our waitress was efficient and nice, but didn't seem too friendly to us otherwise. When we arrived, we weren't greeted by the door, a gal just waved us over to a corner table near the back of the room, so I take off points for that.  I think hosts should welcome diners by the door, then seat them. Call me old fashioned, but it seems more welcoming and friendly to eat there then. They were nice though, just didn't offer any suggestions or ask if we had questions on the menu. We may go back again sometime, I wanted to try the sticky mango rice, but forgot to order it.

The service is always great and its a nice, quiet place to have a meal.", "author": "Sara S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-08", "description": "This place is a little fancier for the typical Thai restaurant, which would justify the slightly more expensive pricing.  Don't get me wrong though, the food here is very good.  I would definitely come back if i was in the neighborhood.  If you were looking for a nicer/cleaner looking place for thai food, this is a good choice.  Not very much seating inside so I wouldn't do a large party.", "author": "farmta s."}

Pumpkin curry was as advertised by the many reviewers before me - just sublime on a brins fall afternoon.  \n\nChef Pai is warm and gracious.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Place is cute and clean.  Food was great.  Open for lunch (which puts it ahead of Thep right from the start).  \n\nAs a super-bonus, wandering a block south we got to Bankyoto for mochi for dessert.  Oh, and you won't have room, so get the mochi to go.", "author": "Craig R."}

It was OK, but not memorable.  The menu did not have many choices and most were shrimp based.  They were good if you liked all your courses to be shrimp..  I tried the pork, which was not reccomended by the owner.  She was right in not suggesting it.  The menu was not as varied or interesting .as other Thai dinners.  I will try it for lunch as I live three blocks away.", "author": "irwin s."}

The dish comes from northern Thailand, and it is the most authentic dish you can get in SF.\nMy other favorites are pumpkin curry, stuffed basil eggplant and Gaeng deang ( red curry).\nI spent 3 months in Thailand, and when I was in Chiang Mai, I had this dish for the first time. I ate few times a week indeed. \nI could not find any thai restaurant in the city that had kho soi preprared well, so to tell you the truth, I kind of do not want to share this info with anyone so when I go to the restaurant, I get my fav table and have a quiet ambience.\n\nThere is no line, restaurant is very cozy and very clean. \nIt is one of 3 best thai restaurant in San Francisco!\n\nrestaurant is closed on mondays for catering services.\nmeg", "author": "megan q."}

The food is incredible-some of the best thai food I've ever eaten.  The sauces are incredibly delicate and delicious and I can't say enough about the service.  Everyone who works here is very sweet.

I called today for take out and even though they were closed (no staff), the owner was still willing to make food for me to pick up (that's impressive!). Not only that, they even wanted to help me take the food to my car! Very nice people, who went out of their way to accommodate us. Plus, the food is as good as anything else I've had if not better.", "author": "Amar P."}

The staff is super friendly and entertained my 1 1/2 year old part of the time. The food is fantastic. I got the thai shrimp basil as hot as they'd make it. It was great. And nice to find a place that isn't afraid to give it to you hot enough.  We will definitely be back.", "author": "colleen i."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-09", "description": "This has become our go-to Thai restaurant.  We actually live closer to Thep Phenom, but regularly choose Jitlada instead, due to the better service and more pleasant dining experience.  The food at Jitlada is just as good, if not better than Thep Phenom, and the service has always been great.  It gets busy, but we've never been unable to get a table when we've stopped in.  I'm a big fan of the Pumpkin Curry and any of their specials (especially anything served in a pineapple).  And I love the fact that they serve Chang beer.  I even left my winter hat there the other night, and they had it waiting for me when I came back for it a few hours later.  Great people, great service, and great food.", "author": "Lee M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-23", "description": "the food here rocks.  it's probably hard to distinguish yourself as a thai restaurant in SF.  jitlada doesn't do this with clever fusion dishes or a swank decor.  instead, it serves up truly reliable yummy thai food.  i live nearby and i order out all the time.  i don't even use the menu, and they are always so friendly about cooking me something up.  finally dined inside with my folks last week.  was a great experience.  the staff is very friendly (albeit a little aloof as their english isn't great).  but the owner is a doll...checking on you often, and bundle of energy.  highly recommended.  the perfect neighborhood joint.", "author": "Terence M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-29", "description": "Every time we visit San Francisco from the East coast we can't escape the feeling that the trip is not going to be complete  without eating at Jitlada. Once we tasted  their amazing food no other Thai restaurant we tried over the years could come even close to that level of flavor and presentation. We experienced a friendly, attentive service and felt very cozy and comfortable in their little but nicely decorated restaurant. We recommend it to everyone who loves great Thai cuisine and cozy, nice ambiance. Once you try it you'll never going to forget it. My only \"complain\" is that we can't have them here on the East coast :). Thank you Jitlada, we'll be back any chance we get.", "author": "Tatyana M."}

I found this place by accident several years ago and bring all my friends and OOT folks here- have not heard one disappointed commet yet.
