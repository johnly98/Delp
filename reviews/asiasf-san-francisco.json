A bucket list must that has been around for years now and that says a lot. \nI went about 15 years ago and I remember that we all had great time. So to do something different for my husbands bday I said lets go here. We also were celebrating my daughters fianc\u00e9s bday that is 2 days before.\nWe did the 9:15 show trying to avoid traffic-still traffic just a tad less. SF is sheer chaos right now with the downtown delays and closures.\nParking was easy on the street a block away. They have a red carpet back drop for photos opps when you get there. They usher you in to the down stairs club while you wait. We started here with some tequila shots and danced some old school songs while we waited.\nDinner started probably about 20-30mins later. They do an announcement over the intercom and one of your hostess/dancers/performers seat you.\nI loved the our menu had their names and Happy birthday on it. \nWhen you reserve (call or open table) they give you dinning options(Silver, gold and platinum packages) we got the silver about $70 pp. They add SF mandate tax and 20%. Gratuity with optional tip for performers. \nAll food came out in a timely manner and was actually good-a rarity in dinner/show world. It was vastly varied (we had some  vegetarian options) and generous portions. Plate after plate until the table was full. Servers came in and out while the gals of Asia SF put on a sexy fun show. \nDrink specials also available and during the break while we kept eating( OMG by now Im just about to explode)they come to your table say hi and even do a body shot or 2!! We were super rowdy and had a fun time. \nThe last part the warm banana beignets with Nutella -yes please and YUM!!! After that ice-cream cones!!! Shut the front door!\nTelling you that I went home rolling.....\nGreat night lots of laughs, lots of eating, gorgeous ladies and fun.

Obviously drag shows aren't hard to find, but AsiaSF puts a fun twist into the scene. The Asia-dilla, filet mignon and banana split are the way to go. \n\nProportion: (5) the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois gives you 3 well proportioned courses. They are spread out with enough time for your stomach to give your brain the signal that you've eaten enough, so you leave satisfied. \n\nPrice: (4) a dinner for two and some drinks are going to run you over a $100. It's a lot of money, but it's also an experience \n\nQuality: (3) the food is good, but it's not awesome. You can't go wrong with a medium rare filet mignon though. I also really liked the Asia-dilla but thought the salmon fire cracker was a bit too fishy. \n\nService: (3) we were sitting at the far end of the bar, which ended up being prime for the show, but didn't see the bar tender/waiter very often. It can get loud during the show and you're obviously supposed to be paying attention instead of ordering more food; so don't expect to see a server more than 2 or 3 times while you're there \n\nExperience: (5) the show is a lot of fun. The dancers feed off crowd's attention, so if you're there for a packed night, you'll see a fun show. I mentioned that the end of the bar (closest to the entrance) was a good spot because it seemed like every dancer did something fun with me or my girlfriend. I had my shirt off at one point and my girlfriend got some ice cream cone and a cherry (from the girls)", "author": "Kevin R."}

Doesn't necessarily need to be a bachelorette party or birthday party. Grab a group of friends and head on out for a night of dancing, singing and great food. \n\nFor a large party of 6 or more guests, you can choose between the Gold, Platinum or Diamond Package. The Gold had plenty of food to share and everything is done family style. The Gold package comes with 9 dishes and ice cream for dessert. Every menu is pre-fixed and some of my favorite dishes of the night were the Asia-dilla, the Chicken Satay skewers and the Ginger Lime Seared Steak Salad. \n\nThe show is amazing! All the ladies are awesome, funny, beautiful and talented. It's a great place to celebrate with friends!

It is definitely fun to come with a group and I've had a great time listening to the music, watching them dance, and having some pretty delicious libations.  Afterwards we went downstairs to the nightclub/dance room for some drinks and dancing.  All around we had a fabulous time!\n\nSome cons...it can be a hard to find parking in the area so come early enough for street parking and just sit in your car to chill for a bit.

AsiaSF is the perfect combination of good music, awesome food, and amazing performances for any occasion. I've been here a few times and have never walked away disappointed. \n\nAMBIANCE gives me nightclub realness with a splash of upscale restaurant. There's a full bar with seating for groups circled around it. If you're a couple or alone, you'll most likely be sitting at the bar, but considering the performers and bartenders are within arm's reach, it's not a bad deal. \n\n**What I love about this spot? If you call ahead and let them know you're celebrating something special, they'll hand you a custom menu with it on there. The MC also gives shout outs, which is always a good time.\n\nOh, did I mention there's a dance club downstairs? Awesome for getting pumped for the show or keeping the party going.\n\nORDERED salmon firecrackers, asia-dilla, miso glazed king salmon, Brussel sprouts, ginger lime steak salad, trio or miniature ice cream cones, Tina's Pussycat (cocktail).\n\nFOOD is amazing.

We had no idea what we were seeing and I didn't have time to read the reviews so we came here cold turkey tonight.  Our friends drove us here and Asia SF is located on 9th and Howard and the outside is a bit on the seedy side but the area across the street is under construction, so there must be a new building being built. \n\nWe arrived and were greeting by a lovely woman but then I knew we were in for a fun night!  We ordered the menage a trois for 1-5 guests and it is pretty reasonable for a 3 course meal.\n\n\nWe had 4 appetizers to share and had Tamarind Chicken Satays, Salmon Firecracker, Grilled Shrimp and Herb Salad, and Sake Steamed Mussels.  There were four skewers of chicken satays, 4 salmon firecrackers, plenty of grilled shrimp and herb salad and plenty of mussels!  It was perfect to taste each one.  All were tasty but my favorite were the mussels and firecrackers, so yummy!\n\nThen we each ordered a main course:  Miso glazed salmon (a large tender piece), Baby Got Ribs (6 finger licking pieces), Malaysian Diver Scallops and Filet Mignon!  I had the filet mignon and it was cooked medium rare as I like and very delicious and tender!  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Trio of Mini Ice Cream Cones (tropical flavors including Ube), Bananas Beignets Split with a macadamia nut brittle (yum yum), Calamansi Key Lime Pie, melts in your mouth and Warm Chocolate Cake.  My favorite was mine, the bananas beignet!\n\nWe had the appetizers first and at 8 pm the show began and I had no idea what to expect!  3 dancers came out one by one to dance to popular tunes in costume and my favorite was Aliyah who dances very well.  Then came the main courses and then dessert came and then the second half, 4 dancers came out again.  It is hard to believe that they are transgender and looking glamorous and beautiful dancing on stage.  Aliyah came out and also danced with Luis to a latin song, very well done!\n\nThis is a great place to celebrate special occasions like bachelorette parties, anniversaries, birthdays, to enjoy life and celebrate diversity as well.  When I got home, I later read that Asia SF has been around since 1998 and I didn't even know about it!  I thought it was a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.

We had the gold package (the lowest rung) and it was already so much food we took home at least 6 boxes. It was insane amounts of food, and if you have any vegetarians in your party, you will get an extra plate of everything in the menu cooked as a vegetarian dish. Holy moly!  Of all the items, I enjoyed most the tamarind chicken skewers, the salmon firecrackers (salmon was surprisingly flavorful and marinated well), ahi tuna burgers, and the backribs were really good (but messy...  yum). Dessert was a ton of mini ice cream cones in tropical flavors like taro (my favorite), coconut and passionfruit. Perfect!  \n\nPrice is surprisingly not ridiculous, although cocktails are $12ish each.

And come with an open mind, low expectations and a tape in case if your jaw drops to the ground. \n\nFood: They do have a variety of menu items for each course for the dinner show. I recommend coming with a bigger group so that you can each order something different to try. Quality and taste of the food are probably worth 3.5-4 stars depending on what you get. Baby back ribs was a little on the dry side, but my friends really loved the crab cakes. The chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream 4 years ago was the bomb, but I just got it recently - it wasn't the same anymore - no more chocolate lava filling. \n\nService: was pretty good. You can only really get attention between shows, so make sure to put in your orders for drinks quick. If you are celebrating a special occasion, they do a complimentary boob shot - it was nice. \n\nLadies: They are hot to a point - they can confuse you and your loved one's sexuality. I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you are coming with a small group - so that you can have a good view of the show.\n\nOverall, definitely recommended!

We got the Groupon for two ($50) and were very happy with the entertainment and a surprisingly very yummy 3-course meal!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-19", "description": "For 8/9 people it was out first experience at AsiaSF. When we check in for our 9:15 dinner we were directed to the downstairs bar until our table was ready. Driving from Sacramento, we all needed to use the restroom first. The restrooms are atrocious! I didn't even mind that it was a small space, but the doors didn't lock, the supports were coming out of the wall and the toilet was barely attached to the floor! I thought it was gonna tip over when I flushed! Lol It did have running water, soap and paper towels. \n\nWhen I checked to see if our table was ready, I asked one of the ladies seating people and she just couldn't make up her mind for the longest time if we were one table or the other next to it. Our party was supposed to be next to my brother's party. She finally settled on table, which was the one I expected. When I brought my party from downstairs someone else stopped us asking for the party name and we were directed to other table not next to my brother, but OK. \n\nThere are 3 dinner packages to choose from for 6+ guests: Gold, Platinum and Diamond- each with different plate options. We pre-ordered the Diamond package online with the 14 premium appetizers and a champagne toast- supposedly \"the ultimate feast\". Dinner started coming out and everything looked and tasted pretty good. No complaints there. It is served family style, so for nine people it wasn't the biggest of portions. With 14 appetizers we thought it would be fine. Food was good and came out fairly smoothly while transitioning to the next set of appetizers. \n\nThey informed us champagne would be served and ours came out pretty late compared to everyone else. Once it arrived, we all noticed our glasses were a little less than half full, which seemed odd being that we ordered the highest package. \n\nWe looked around at the large table next to us, where we originally should have been seated, and their champagne glasses were completely full. Judging by their dinner they definitely didn't have the same Diamond package because it does not include burgers. We asked about the champagne and they said that table has a different package. DUH. On the menu, the champagne doesn't come with the Gold or Platinum menu. We ignored the champagne mixup and waited for more food, which took longer than expected compared to the first time with no show in between. \n\nWe received a couple more dishes, but it did not amount to the 14 appetizers as stated on the menu. We did not receive the \"Porcupines\", Baby Got Back Ribs\", and \"Malaysian Diver Scallops\". We tried inquiring about the remainder of the items, but were never answered. Dessert came out and the ice cream cones were good. The \"Banana Beignets\" were OK and the \"Mini Chocolate cakes\" were good if you like dense, rich chocolate. We were given the bill with still no mention of the missing appetizers. Maybe the message got lost in translation? Who knows. \n\nI understand it was really busy, but for a place that has been open for so long and has a high volume of people coming through regularly, you would assume they should expect how busy it can get and better prepare the timing and service. \n\nThe show, dancers and quality of food were good, but the dinner experience was highly underwhelming. The cost for dinner ($75/each), plus added 20% gratuity due to a large party, 4% SF Employer Mandate fee, and tax did not amount to the lack of service and food provided; really disappointing. \n\nI really wanted to love this place and come back often, but honestly, if I do go back it would only be because a different group of friends still wanted to check it out. I don't know how I feel spending another $100 on dinner when you basically only get 1 piece of food from each dish. \n\nIf you do decide to get the Diamond package, I can at least recommend bringing only 6 people so you can get a couple more pieces of food each. You should probably make a day of it in the city as well so you are already full from lunch and not expecting to be full from dinner alone. \n\nAfter this experience, a smaller party of 1-5 people looks like the best option. All small parties get the  3 course dinner menu. Each individual orders a first course, main course and dessert from the entire menu. \n                                  *Side note* \nI was able to take pictures with Bionka and Nya! Nya came to our table and took pictures with us/chatted.They were both wonderful! True gems to AsiaSF! \n\nUpdate: I emailed management the morning after about the poor service. While apologetic, they initially only offered a $79 refund which is the cost for 1 person on Diamond Menu. It wasn't even enough to give each person at least $10 back, so I asked if they could at the very least refund $90 so that could be split evenly. They agreed, but we still don't feel it was comparable to the included gratuity (almost $300!).", "author": "Tamara H."}

They told us they would announce when the 9:15 show was ready and only then would we head for the dining area. \n\nWhen we were finally seated we were amazed at how close we were to where the performers would be performing. I would say it was the best seat of the house. \n\nAs for the food, the food was served after we chose our 3 course meal options. I ordered the Shrimp salad, Filet mignon, and the rice pudding. The portions were pretty big but the flavors were a bit lacking. This is probably my third time here but the food isn't what I would say their fine expertise. The shrimp salad was a bit minty, the Filet mignon sauce not that great, and the rice pudding a bit bland. \nAs for the show, it was pretty entertaining but when I had asked the host to announce my roommate's birthday her name was never mentioned.

The service was attentive, and the entertainment was out of this world!\n\nLast night was my 2nd time here, and it was just as fun as I remembered! Please make sure you go on a Friday or Saturday night, because the club downstairs is closed on Sundays. Its alot more fun with the club because there's also a stage and some performances. Of course they also interact with the crowd and pull special guests on stage to make things more fun (especially for bride-to-be's and birthdays, etc). Anyway the show during dinner is amazing to watch. The ladies are all so beautiful and so skilled at dancing. There was one lady that was especially beautiful and her hiphop routine was soooooooo hot. There are 2 shows that occur, with an intermission in between. And at the end, they bring all the girls on stage again for a finale. In between they go around the bar and do special things with the guests, like blowjob shots! The MC also goes around the room and introduces the special events celebrating that night. It was my friend Minh's birthday, and they kept making a pun out of his name resembling \"men\". harharhar. He obviously got a blowjob shot, and also one of the lady's came by at one point and took off his shirt...\n\nWe had a party of about 30 and took up almost half of the upstairs area. (club is downstairs) We got the diamond package, which ended up about 95$ per person after including all other fees. Honestly for the price, they didn't provide us with enough food. We sat 8 people to a table, filling 3. For a few of the main entrees, we received 2 plates of the same dish per table to share. But mind you, this was only for a few of the dishes. Most of them only came 1 dish per table, so each person could rly only have a small bite. Each dish, including the dessert, was decent and appetizing. But they weren't something to write home and rave about. The real standout for me was the miso salmon. It was extremely fresh and cooked to tender perfection, and melted in my mouth. I just remembered that I didn't get to see the receipt, so part of the $95 probably came from drinks that we ordered. If you make reservations for a special event, they will print out personalized menus for your table, with the special person's name! \n\nUse the Yelp Check in offer for a free signature shot!

The food wasn't great, the drinks were watered down, and there were WAYYY too many hidden fees. Of the 7 of us, we only got 3 drinks total, and ordered the cheapest dinner plan. Somehow the total cost ended up being $100 per person, and the waitress was so rude when we questioned why the bill was so high.\n\nAccording to their website, we should have only paid $50 per person plus tax and drinks. \n\nNot to mention the DJ downstairs was horrible.

When you first arrive they will have you wait downstairs in the little club area. It's cute down there and I'm sure you could have fun but to me it was way too hot down there... they really need some air in there! You have to make reservations! When I called there were barely any seats left and that was almost 2 weeks in advance...We ended up sitting at the bar which has its pros and cons! \nThe  seats/stools became very uncomfortable after awhile if at least had some back support it would of helped a little... ok so I sound so old after writing that! Lol\nIt's hard to talk to everyone in your group at the bar... that was the worst part.\nAgain it was hot as hell in here and no I wasn't full of drinks but the heat sure did not make me want to drink more!\nBut you could see the show front and center so that was the best! Also the bartenders were easy on the eye! Hehehe\nThe food was ok at best... some things better than others! The thing I liked the most was the filet.\nI definitely wouldn't come here for just the food but the food and show combined don't make me feel like I'm getting ripped off. \nThe show was good... my first one so I don't have much to compare too! I did think it was too short and thought I was going to get a little more for the money \nA lot of the performers were gorgeous and could def pass as women! \nAll in all I'm glad I got to experience it but I probably won't return!

I asked the waitress and she sent over the manager that explained that the service fee is 20% and the Sf mandate fee is 4%...however there is an additional and unstated 8% fee on top of that fee. This is 8% of the 20% and 8% of the 4% which she said is a California State Tax thing and the restaurant does not see any of that. According to our receipt, the state tax was already calculated though. The hidden fees basically added an extra $11 to our $886 bill. I think the menu ought to inform guests of these charges because to just throw it on the bill and assume people aren't going to calculate their meals and notice a discrepancy is a little annoying. \n\nAs I said, this review is mostly based on the hidden fee however there were other glitches with our experience as well. Our reservation was made for 9 people at 7pm on a Saturday evening. We arrived at 6:50pm and weren't seated until 7:30pm. We went downstairs to wait and although the music was great and the ambiance was fun...we were all hungry and it was super stuffy and hot downstairs. The Dj announced that everyone with a 7:15pm reservation should proceed upstairs (I was confused because my reservation was for 7pm...) but anyway the amount of people on those stairs has got to be a safety hazard. The line moved steadily enough but when we arrived at our table there were only 8 seats available for our party of 9. I inquired about the missing seat to 3 separate workers and after my friend stood for nearly 15 minutes someone brought us a seat for her. I understand it was a busy night...but I called to make a reservation for 9 people at 7pm well in advance to avoid us waiting a long time and not having enough seats to sit down in...\n\nOur waitress was kind and explained the menu. She took drink orders and put the alcohol on a separate bill to make splitting the food tab easier for us. The food arrived in a good amount of time. Everything delivered was excellent. The food was hot, fresh, and flavorful. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals (even the vegetarian and those who don't usually enjoy seafood). We selected the platinum meal menu since our party was a large size but it contained a good amount of seafood on it so I was a little worried about the non seafood eaters including myself. We all ended up being very satisfied though. The ribs and asiadilla were my favorite. \n\nThe shows were also enjoyable and I loved the costumes. I thought the costumes were tasteful, sexy, and sparkly. Some of the performers looked a bit bored/tired, but for the most part they did a good job. We enjoyed the song selections as well and I felt like the timing of the shows was pretty good. \n\nI also liked that the main host announced all of the special occasions in the house including birthdays, weddings, and divorces. The waitresses came to these groups and had each celebrated guest take shots placed between their boobs. It was entertaining enough. \n\nAfter our inquire about the numbers not adding up on the bill, we paid and went downstairs to dance some more. If I thought it was stuffy before I was wrong because that second round was crazy. Once the 9pm viewers were called to their tables (at about 9:30pm) the room cleared up a bit and we could move more. We stayed for about a half hour then left.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy my experience but the disorganization and unadvertised fees put a bad taste in my mouth. Our bill came out to $886.16 (not including alcohol that was put on a separate receipt and also charged the hidden fees) and our table wasn't ready for us. \n\nI would recommend visiting here for a unique experience, but just be warned that your bill has hidden fees and your table will not be ready on time.", "author": "Kristy F."}

We were served food continuously for the two hours there. The food was pretty good (I didn't have any expectations) and we had a customized drinks menu since we had already made a reservation for the party. My favorite was a vermicelli salad. We had to pay for the drinks separately and it was not a part of the reservation we had made at $60/person. The show was great and they were all goegeoua. Although, I did expect it to be a little bit longer. It was mostly just individual dance performances that probably lasted about 20minutes all together. After the show, we were directed to the night club downstairs and we had free access to it for two hours. It got pretty crowded quicly, but also got empty soon. The music in the night club was okay they weren't playing popular night club songs) and I guess that made everyone leave. Also, unfortunately there was a poweroutage only in that building, so we left within a half hour. Overall, it was a good experience,  but I expected more of a drag show performances with imitation acts. But for my first time, it was a good experience.

It's dinner and a show and the Filipino drag performers never disappoint. For $65, you get 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert.  There were three of us so we got to sample a lot of their food. Highly recommend the mussels or the duck quesadilla as the appetizer, the orange lamb was good and so was the bread pudding.  They are also very good about the drinks (fast and strong).\n\nIt's a solid 4. The food is good but not great. The ambiance and atmosphere is very old San Francisco. The service can get slow since they are usually packed and busy.  It's not as affordable as it used to be but still reasonably priced for the experience.

Asia Sf Of course. By this time i had already became a regular, coming by for nights of fun with all my friends, i spread the word and after a while there wasn't just 3 of us coming by almost every weekend but around 6 of us, we never had any issues and all my friends loved it. \n\nMy bday night i had a big group of us come by, it was very crowded but we were still able to dance without us bumping in2 each other so it was fun, my friend decided to go buy me a bday shot, 10 mins passed, 15, 20 & i was wondering why she hadn't came back, i see her coming and she has 2 shots in hand but looked very upset, she then explains how the bartender, a short guy who i have of course seen there very often was awfully rude to her. She explains how he took a while to take her order, understandable it was very busy. She asked for 3 shots and a beer, after 15 mins of her asking and him and him not getting her the drinks but instead, chatting w people he knew, throwing ice cubes around and  giving people drinks who approached the bar after my friend, she was getting very frustrated, to top it off he gives her 6 shots and she proceeded to tell him she had asked for 3 and not 6, the bartender yells at her telling her she asked for 6 and she has to pay for them.\nMy friend frustrated, angry and out of impuls\u00e9 throws 4 out of the 6 drinks  and some land on him. \nShe had already been charged the 6 shots and the bartender had denied a refund. Demanding her to pay. Never in my years of visiting night clubs have i been yelled at and forced to pay for something i didn't order & it was absurd that this happened to her. The bartender ran to tell the securities to kick her out, my friend had gone to  look for me and was telling me what happened when the securities approached and due to the bartender apparently being the victim here and refusing to work the rest of the night. My friend was kicked out, On My Bday night. I tried reasoning with the bouncers and tried talking to the manager but all they were saying was that it was my friends word against the bartenders word and the manager did not care to talk to anybody, he didn't care what we had to say.

We came to AsiaSF to see what the hype was about and left a bit disappointed.  We were hoping to be as entertained as we are at the other drag shows we have gone to but this is not a drag show.\n\nFirst we were told to arrive early for our 9:15 dinner show. The tables we not ready so we went to the downstairs bar to wait (we found out while there the drinks are $2 cheaper than upstairs). After coming up for dinner our order wasn't taken til around 930 and the \"show \" didn't start until later so I am not sure why they want you there so early besides to spend money on alcohol.\n\nThe food was decent but nothing I would need to go back for. We were hoping this was going to be a show but it seemed more like a very expensive dinner that happened to have a few performances. The show consisted of a few girls on the bar dancing a bit and lip singing  (the usual except some girls didn't even lip sing more than 25% of the words). There was not really an MC or someone who kept the entertainment going for the evening.\n\nFor 2 of us with dinner and 2 drinks each we spent  $200. Overall the night was not worth the cost at all. I guess if you are here celebrating with a crowd like the 5 bachelorette parties that were there who were already wasted you can entertain yourself and not notice that the show was lacking. \n\nI am not unhappy we went as I love to check out new things and experiences and we had a fun night together but I do not feel the need to go back.", "author": "Danielle B."}

We had a minor hiccup where our sides didn't show up with our meal but after we mentioned it to our bartender Blanca it was quickly fixed and we got our delicious bok choy.  \n\nThe food was good but nothing that stands out too much as being outstanding.  We had the potato samosa's, the seared ahi tuna, crab cakes, orange lamb and finished it off with key lime pie and banana foster beignets.  The samosa was standard made in an egg roll format with good dipping sauces ...they did have the mint dipping sauce but I was missing the tamarind dipping sauce as that is what I love with my samosas.  The rub on the ahi was pretty spectacular in terms of the flavor punch that it delivered.  I enjoyed the crab cakes but for being in the bay I was hoping for more chunky pieces of Dungeness crab which San Francisco is definitely known for.  The lamb ...and I LOVE lamb was a bit over sauced for my liking and over cooked.  I was glad I got the side of bok choy because that cut through some of the sauce flavor and made that lamb dish a bit better.  I didn't get to taste my friends key lime pie but he said it was good but he was hoping for more of a lime punch.  The banana foster was delicious and made for a great finish to my meal.\n\nOur drinks were never empty, the bar staff did a great job of making sure to replenish empty water glasses and of course offer drinks the minute we finished one and the service was just super friendly.  The three behind the bar worked incredibly well as a team and I we had personal interaction with all of them.

When you arrive, you are taken downstairs to their lounge to drink and enjoy their inhouse DJ. Once dinner is ready, they check you in and take you to your table.

Knowing it was my birthday, she treated me to a BJ shot taken from between her legs LOL. \n\nIn my last review I talked about the food not being the best. OMG, what a complete difference. Remember that the 3-course meal will be about $49 and you choose from 7-8 items per course. Here's what I had this time: \n\n-1st Course: Blackened Tuna Sashimi with lemongrass beurre blanc and pickle vegetable salad. You get 6 slices of heaven, fresh tuna and some ginger on the side. Very flavorful and I liked the light beurre blanc under the tuna. Nice dipping sauce. \n\n-Main Course: Miso Glazed King Salmon, sauteed and finished with a miso glaze, served over black rice with a sweet tomato edamame salad. The miso wasn't as prominent but overall, OMG  loved it! A HUGE piece of salmon over lots of rice and the tomato edamame salad brought a refreshing taste. \n\n-Dessert Course: Asian pear and dried cherry spice route bread pudding served with whiskey hard sauce and whipped cream. Another BIG slice of heaven and SOOOO flavorful. What a great way to end the course. \n\nWOW, what an AH-MAZE-ING time.

I honestly wasn't expecting much from dinner and overall really enjoyed the meal. We got the steak salad and seared ahi appetizers. I could have eaten 3 plates of that steak salad. For entrees we ordered the salmon and scallops. Both were a bit lacking in salt for my taste but seafood was fresh and presentation was nice. As for dessert, we got the chocolate cake and fried banana beignets. Both came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and were the perfect sweet treat to end a yummy meal.

Can I have your boobs and asses and tiny waists??? Pleaseeeeee!??? They are super talented. I mean it's hard for me to dance in flats, they literally performed in 4-5 inch heels. That's some Beyonc\u00e9 shit. \n\nWhat else? Oh they have a dance floor/party room for 21+ guests. We went down stairs after dinner n enjoyed the afterparty. Good music. Lots of bras hanging at the bar hahahaha I love this place!", "author": "Kris J."}

My friends and I were in town for a convention but wanted to have a girls night out. A friend of mine suggested Asia SF because she had a blast there for a Bachelorette party.  \n\nThe food is Asian fusion. You get to pick a appetizer, main course, and dessert.  I got the salmon egg rolls which were crunchy and flavorful. The fried shrimp and appetizer salad were also good. My main, the filet mignon, was perfectly cooked.  I tried my friends scallop curry and that was also really good.  The molten chocolate cake was delish. The presentation is really nice too! \n\nThe enteraintament is fun! Some of the younger girls lip synced to modern songs while the older ladies did fun show tunes. \n\nWe went to the 5PM show so it was $40 a person.  I wish I had known about the Groupon!! Even for $40 it was still worth it.", "author": "Cara H."}

I came with a group of girl friends for my bachelorette party. We had a 9:15 seating, got there on time, but our table wasn't ready so they had us go downstairs to the dance club to wait. Surprised it was so crowded down there for how early in the night it was. Somewhere between 9:30-9:45 it sounded like they called over the loud speaker that anyone with 9, 9:15, or 9:30 seatings could go back upstairs for the tables. If I had a 9:00 seating, I'd be so pissed that we didn't get a table for almost 45 minutes, that's for sure.\n\nDinner finally started around 10, but it was really cool the menus were completely personalized for the celebration! We had the \"gold\" dinner, which was somewhere around $50ish per person (prior to adding drinks and tip/tax), and we had 9 tapas (I'm not completely certain on the price or what level of dinner we had, since my maid of honor didn't let me know all the details!). The chicken satays were my favorite, and the soba noodles were also good. Some items were better than others. It wasn't a lot of food, so I wouldn't come on an empty stomach. I'm glad I ate a bunch of junk food (bachelorette weekend afterall) beforehand.\n\nThe drink menu was pretty long. I had \"Jasmine's Tarantula,\" which was basically a margarita. The bartender(s) weren't consistent... my first and second ones tasted completely different. The first being better than the second.\n\nAs the \"guest of honor\" for the night, I got a complimentary shot. A \"blowjob\" shot, that I had to get on my knees and take from between our waitress's knees while she was sitting in front of me. If you're not an outgoing person, you'd probably hate doing it. I didn't mind, it wasn't a big deal. The shot was very tasty.\n\nThe one major thing that stuck out to our whole group, and it was probably on us not knowing going into it, was that we all thought the show was going to be a drag show, with drag queens. It didn't bother us that the girls are all transgender, but the show was just decidedly different than the type of entertainment that a drag show provides. Drag is a complete performance.... snarky, over-the-top, dramatic, etc. AsiaSF was just girls dressed up, dancing,  and lip synching. Some of the lip synching wasn't even that good. But some of the girls were great!\n\nWould I come again? Probably not. But it was a good night and I enjoyed myself a lot!", "author": "Angela H."}

However I wasn't extraordinarily impressed with anything in particular (that isn't to say I didn't have fun though!). The stage is a narrow walkway/bar counter which limits the types of performances, the DJ downstairs was playing mostly 2006-2008 music (was not lit at all!), but the food was pretty good. The platinum package came with 12 dishes; I liked most of the dishes but really was not a fan of soba noodles or the miso salmon. \n\nI came with a group of 9 around 9:15pm on a Saturday and went to the club downstairs to wait for our table to be ready--took about 10 minutes. Food/drinks came maybe ~20 minutes after being seated. \n\nThe performances were not bad; the girls definitely got their struts down. Most of their performance was lip syncing to music and doing catwalks on the narrow stage but some came to the floor to dance. Others even called up individuals to dance with them on the floor. One of the girls' signature moves was giggling her boobs and butt with her hand while making eye contact with someone. Another performer actually sang. Each girl did something a little different which was nice. There were breaks between performances where waiters would serve the next round of food.  Also, before and after the performances, they did shoutouts to the groups that were there and at one point, they offered blowjob shots to the special people (bday girls or bachelorettes etc). I think the performance could have been better had there been more space to dance or perform together. \n\nTips: They claim that if you go after 9, you aren't kicked out after 1 hr 45 min of eating. I also don't know if there are significant differences between then prime time and special finale shows; but I guess the 'finale' we received was when all the girls stood up on stage and did a small 1 minute number to the 'Dreamgirls' theme track before bowing. \n\nAnd finally, our total was a little more than $100 per person. It was an entertaining night and I went with a good group of people but I don't have the urge to go back anytime soon.", "author": "Lydia Z."}

Everyone here is absurdly nice and I was seriously dying from how kind everyone was being. Ridiculous! I had an expired Groupon THAT THEY STILL LET ME REDEEM and on top of that they let me use the Yelp Check In Offer for the free kamikaze shots. They are so generous here! \n\nOur bartender was Zach and he is everything 14 year old me would have ever wanted in life. Something about him just screams high school heart throb even though he was clearly a grown man who has a day job as a scientist. Drool. Dying. Dead. Another waiter saw my friend struggling with her stool and brought her another one wtf. I did not know people this attentive and nice existed. \n\nWe came on a Thursday and it was probably about 80% full. They only have one seating on Wednesdays at 7:15. The show didn't start until 8:45 and there was an intermission and continued during dessert. \n\nI got the Blackened Ahi Tuna Sashimi (just seared ahi tuna really). I ate the whole thing. Oh and I'm gluten free and they had everything helpfully labeled on the menu for gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan. Love it! The entree was scallops which was actually I believe one very large scallop sliced up with sweet potatoes, string beans, and rice. Dessert was forbidden rice pudding which was the only gluten free dessert on the menu besides the dessert drinks. I loved everything I had but my friend didn't love her tuna burger appetizer. She said it was way too much bread so maybe skip that one. She also got the lamb entree and wished she got the filet mignon instead which is what she originally wanted. Some girls next to us got it and they were raving about it. \n\nThe show was great and my favorite dancer was Nya. I think she is supposed to be the star of it or something because her dancing was amazing and she was so pretty!!!! My favorite thing about the whole show is how much they love to celebrate events. I love love love celebrations. They legit celebrated a girl who was visiting from Livermore. LIVERMORE. Hilarious. There was also a gay couple getting married, birthday girls, and people visiting from overseas and they gave everyone shoutouts and free shots. Such a fun place! \n\nAt the end of the night the Friday/Saturday bartender Edgar came and said hi and told us to pay him a visit over the weekend at the club downstairs.

This time, although we had a great time, the food was awful. So for the experience I would rate this higher as the show is funny but for the price, the food could really be a lot better. \n\n   The show, the \"ladies of AsiaSF\",  are not technically ladies, that is the might look pretty close now but they were born men is the easiest way to explain that. Some are pretty convincing but some are not. They play off that obvious question singing songs that celebrate diversity and that are just fun. \n\n   The lounge, downstairs they have a bar with DJ's spinning dance music with plenty of space to dance. There is even a stripper pole if you are feeling adventurous that anyone can \"ride\". The shows are done for a full house at set times so they stage the early arrivals in this area. I believe that anyone can come down to the lounge but to see the show, you have to have reservations. \n\n   The food, ugh, my wife ordered the filet mignon \"as rare as you can make it\" and there was not a hint of pink to be found on that poor steak. I ordered the orange lamb, just like filet, lamb needs to be cooked on the rarer side otherwise it gets tough and dry. My lamb was so overcooked that it actually turned to powder in my mouth, I didn't eat it.\n\n    In my opinion, if they lost the food and just made this a bar show, then people wouldn't have to be disappointed. Our bill for 3 people was $206 and that was for a meal that I couldn't eat. Either eat before you get here, or stay away from the fillet and lamb and you will be ok.\n\n    One last note, you can see from my pictures of the first time and this last time the food was cooked with less care this time around.

My colleagues made reservations a week before the actual day. We came here on a Friday right when they opened which was 7PM and was able to grab a great seat by the window in the corner. \n\nAsiaSF offers two shows during the night. One from 7PM and another one at 9PM. This means that you have 2 hours to have the time of your life but be aware that all good things have to come to an end.\n\nThey also serve a dinner show menu for everyone no matter how small or big your party size is. The offer:\n*M\u00e9nage A Trios- 1-5 guest.  Choose: Any FIRST course, Any MAIN course, and any dessert or dessert drink.\n*Gold Package- 6 or more guests. Includes: nine delectable items with miniature ice cream cones for dessert.\n*Platinum Package-6 or more guests. Include: Eleven mouthwatering dishes including 2 desserts our most popular menu - a favorite for seafood lovers.\n*Diamond Package-6 or more guest include fourteen premium items including filet mignon, a Champagne toast & three desserts - the ultimate feast\n\nThe food was delicious and filling. I couldn't even it all of it! I wonder if that was because of all the excitement. Whatever it was...I enjoyed the food while I was devouring it. I started off with the Ahi Tuna Sliders; it was a whole burger that was cut in fours. Next was the ribs that I have to admit was hot and tasty! Then the dessert, how could I say no to that!? \n\nOur server for the night was black beauty diva \"Bionka\" not only was she gorgeous but she was so efficient and made sure that my table and the birthday girl was taken care of! Did I mention that she also is a great performer? Yes, the servers are also the performers and I have to admit that they sure know how to perform on that bar! I loved every minute of it!\n\nIs it your birthday? Well, I hate to spoil the surprise for you...but be prepared to take a lovely shot! Yes, after the performance, the server sits by you with a shot in between her legs and you have to grab it *only using your mouth* and swallow it all! *HAHA* what a delightful night! Nothing gets better than this!\n\nAfter your dinner you have the option of getting free access to their club downstairs and its free entry all night! Although, I was too full and excited about the dinner performance, I didn't get the chance to take advantage of the club scene so I have to come back and experience it!\n*PS-Friday/Saturday night dance club open until 2 AM.\n\nI would definitely encourage you to pick up the phone and make a reservation. This of the next big event or celebration you have and grab friends and celebrate here, you truly won't be disappointed.\n\nThank you AsiaSF for making my birthday the best I have had in a while!

Either way, here is my honest review.\n\nOnce we arrived about an hour before the show, we were told to go downstairs to their club area. When I got downstairs, all I saw was women that were celebrating a bachelorette party. The DJ didn't even have Rupaul... What kind of drag bar is this? Or am I under the wrong impression? \n\nThe show finally started and by started, I mean we were seated for the final show of the night.\n\n\n40$ for an appetizer, entree and dessert isn't bad but food was absolutely mediocre. And mediocre is a compliment. \n\nAfter appetizers were served, the first show started with a drag queen veteran. She was definitely from the old school drag performance days. I loved it. All the girls afterwards were targeting sex appeal versus pulling out the tricks and not taking yourself so seriously mentality. \n\nSomething I'd like to mention is there is no stage. All queens perform on the bar top. Which is interesting... I'm used to hamburger Mary's set up with a stage, pole and all other necessary show essentials.\n\n\nThere was a break after the first show and then we got to the final performances. The girls were sexy and serving up fishy realness but I thought they could interact with the audience more. I'm used to getting made fun of or watching others get made fun of by the queens. Just more interaction in general. \n\n\nAll in all... The food was bland and the performances were too fishy for me. It's a fun place for bachelorette parties or divorce celebrations (lol) but as far as drag lovers.... I'd say there is more transgender performers here and it shows. Nothing against them and they're all absolutely stunning.... But I like a drag show with more interaction with the audience and a little more masculinity. \n\n\nI don't think I'll return.", "author": "Ashley L."}

The concierge at our hotel recommended Asia SF. I was bit nervous taking my 14 year old daughter to this show considering the risqu\u00e9 attire I saw the performers wear on Yelp images. But once I mentioned that we could see a drag show in SF, she couldn't stop talking about it. \n\nOur concierge made the reservations and we were lucky to get a table for four the very same night at 7:15pm (they have later show times). We later found out that there was a Groupon deal for two for one price. We weren't sure if they would accept the Groupon since our hotel's concierge made the reservation for us.\n\nThe outside of the restaurant looks a little sketchy (almost strip club like). But once we entered the restaurant we saw a lively atmosphere. There's a bar in the middle of the restaurant that has a runway for the performers. The dining tables surround the bars and there's not that much room in between the tables.\n\nWe liked the energy. My daughter was thrilled because she felt that she was at a nightclub. I highly recommend the show and restaurant. I wouldn't recommend Asia SF if you have small children that need space to move around and if you prefer a quiet dinner. But if you have an open mind, want fantastic entertainers, and eat great food then definitely experience Asia SF.\n\nCons-\n1. Small space between tables (didn't bother us at all; it felt cozy).\n2. The dancers don't really interact with the guests during their performances. \n\nPros-\n1. Beautiful performers and entertainers.\n2. Fantastic value with Groupon and without.\n3. Great location for travelers staying in the city.\n4. Food was excellent (not fine dinging but for what you pay it's an incredible value).\n5. Lots of food for what you pay.\n6. Drinks are fairly priced.\n7. Everyone was super friendly and helpful (we kept dropping our chopsticks and our food runner brought us new pairs each time with a smile).\n8. The performers danced well and were professionals.\n9. The waitress made sure that they accepted our Groupon. She actually waited to ring up our tab until we purchased our Groupon vouchers.", "author": "Aline B."}

Excellent service.\n\nThe food - I was able to try the Porcupines, Filet Mignon, and the Mini Ice Cream cones. All three were delicious. The Porcupine was tasty and fresh, the Filet Mignon was flavorful (and the potato stars are adorable), and the ice creams made for a perfect sampler and a great end to the meal. A good amount of thought was put into the food. The drinks were also excellent (and strong).\n\nThe performance - Each Queen who graced the stage killed it with their performance and the audience was made to feel like they were part of the show.  \n\nSince it was a Sunday, it was not very busy.

I definitely recommend making a reservation, as the dinners are by showtimes and it was a full house when we went. \n\nNote that there's a 3 course prix-fixe meal, so you have to get an appetizer, entree, and a dessert or a dessert drink.  I got the mussels for my appetizer, which was really good!  I like it a lot and our server even brought me extra toasted bread for the broth.  For my main entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was also pretty good.  For dessert, I selected the ice cream trio, which I ordered because it looked so cute.  Overall the food was pretty good, not life changing -- but you aren't going for the food are you?\n\nThe drinks...okay they were good but woah -- expensive.  $15 a drink.  They were good, but yikes.  Also, check in on Yelp and get a free gummie bear shot. \n\nOur server, Carlos, was PHENOMENAL.  Honestly, best waiter I've had in a very long time.  He was kind and courteous, and just went above and beyond to make sure we were having a great time and everything we needed.  He even took our picture, which was so nice.  The service here is exceptional. \n\nThe show was awesome.  We got to sit in the middle of the bar, so basically we got super lucky with the best seats in the house.  Small groups of 2 or 3 get to sit right up at the bar where the ladies perform -- so it was pretty awesome.  Bigger groups sit behind at actual tables.  \n\nI definitely was blown away at how much fun I had, I highly recommend coming at least once.  It's fun, so it's great for out of towners, but to expensive to frequent.", "author": "Michelle S."}

They sure know how to have a good time here. \n\nDinner is a set menu and comes with a show with the \"ladies\" of AsiaSF.  It's a little pricey at around $50. There are two shows nightly: 7:15 or 9:15. You choose an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The food was ok. The entrees really shined though, especially the filet mignon. It came out a perfect medium rare and had really good flavor. I was impressed. \n\nThe Show: Packed with high energy music, the ladies dance on top of the bar counter. My favorite actually was a number by one of the older ladies wearing a wonder woman outfit and dancing to Bonnie Tyler's I Need a Hero. So much fun.  \n\nService: Everyone was super nice here and checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything. Our server even brought us all shots at the end! We had groupons that were supposed to be valid only for the 7:15 show, but they let us use it for the 9:15. They really just want everyone to have a good time. \n\nTip: Come a little earlier before your dinner reservation and head downstairs for drinks and dancing! Love the music they play here. None of that EDM stuff, they play a mix of old school Salt n Pepa to Justin Bieber.", "author": "Jen P."}

Make sure you make reservations. They have different times for seatings, but each seating is for two hours.\n\nSHOW\nThe show was shorter than I expected. If you want a really good show of similar taste, check out Red Hots Burlesque instead. The show here is about 6 dances that consists mostly of strutting and some booty shaking. It is still incredibly fun, but I'm not bragging to all my friends about the ladies' dance talent. The ladies here are incredibly beautiful though!\n\nA note on the setup: the ladies dance on top of the bar, which is a strip that cuts the restaurant in half. All of the large parties sit in the front, and all of the smaller parties (less than 5-6) sit in the back. This resulted in us mainly getting the dancer's back the entire time, which is good or bad depending on what you want to look at. ;)\n\nDINNER\nYou would think a mandatory dinner would be pretty whatever, but there were definitely some highlights!\n\nFirst course\n- Ahi burgers- skip, mostly roll.\n- Sake steamed mussels- good, generous portion and tasty.\n- Blackened tuna sashimi- good, generous number of pieces.\n- Salmon firecrackers- skip, too much wrapper.\n\nMain course\n- Malaysian diver scallops- good!\n- Filet mignon- good filet, eggplant was good, potato stars are cute and novel.\n\nDesserts\n- Banana beignets split- delicious brandy flamed bananas with amazing chocolate and caramel sauces.\n\nTickets are $39 during off-peak hours and $56 during peak hours. They also tack on a mandatory 20% service charge and 4% SF mandate.\n\nIf you are coming to celebrate anything, be sure to let the staff know.

This place is perfect for all kinds of celebrations! They welcome all birthdays of all ages over 21, bachelorette parties, bachelor parties, divorces, anniversaries, you name it they will celebrate with you!! Tell the server so you can do a cum shot off her boobs or crotch! So much fun.\n\nThe entertainment is definitely fun and raunchy. The food is okay but they've got to get their portions correct! I recently came with a party of 12 and got the Platinum Package. For some of the dishes we were given 3 plates, some dishes we were given 2 plates and it was a bit embarrassing and annoying to have to ration out bites of food for everyone. We mentioned this numerous times to our server and they apologized and said they'd check on it but nothing ever happened. They also missed a couple of our drink orders. It was quite a busy night, but they've got go get their operations together!\n\nCome here for the entertainment, but not for the food. You'd leave hungry. The menu makes it look like you get tons of food but you really get ONE bite of everything. The drinks are very sugary sweet (ALL OF THEM), but fun to drink.

She chose the $56 eight course Gold menu, which the staff personalized with a birthday message. \n\nFor starters we had:\n\nSalmon firecrackers-- one of my favorites! Freshly cooked salmon, glass noodles, and veggies fried to a crisp as egg rolls sliced diagonally in half. The light dip was good too. \n\nMy other favorite was the steak salad-- delicious! Flavors popping all over the place with seared thinly sliced beef tenderloin and shiitake mushrooms, onions, greens, carrots, all tossed in ginger lime dressing. I would've been happy with a large bowl of this and the firecrackers. \n\nAsia-dilla with smoked duck, jack and manchego cheese, peppers, scallions, with a side of yummy sun-dried cherry creme fraiche dip that reminds me of strawberry cream cheese (love)\n\nTamarind Chicken satay was a bit dry, but the non spicy peanut dip fixed that. \n\nSeared ahi tuna sliders (a whole burger sliced in fours) were fully cooked with horseradish and Chinese cabbage slaw on top-- didn't really like this, thought most of it would be raw.\n\nThey served an additional app not on the menu! We got to try potato egg rolls that tasted like samosas. \n\nThree \"entrees\":\n\nCool sesame soba noodle was just ok. Barely any marinated tofu. \n\nRibs were alright, no major flavor boost.\n\nSpicy orange lamb was chopped up in bite sized pieces in sauce, had a side of sticky white rice and pickled cucumbers. I liked the thin round plantain chips stuck on the rice. \n\nThe dessert that never fails: ICE CREAM!\nMy cousin definitely chose this place for the Filipino macapuno ice cream SMH. The trio of flavors included ube (purple yam) with toasted coconut topping, macapuno (young coconut) with candied peanuts, and my new love langka (jackfruit) with a sun dried cherry. I was so tempted to ask our neighbors for their three langka cones. Instead, I watched them melt with a frown on my face. If my cousin had been sitting next to me, we would've asked. \n\nI must have bad luck with drinks in SF because this was the second time my drink was too strong! First at Infusion, now here. I must look like a heavyweight. \nI ordered Karmina's Kiss (unknowingly from Karmina herself) for $12 and I'm surprised I finished it by midnight. Kind of disappointed the martini glass it came in wasn't all dolled up in at least pink sugar crystals. Where's the aesthetic appeal? The maraschino cherry sank to the bottom. Maybe try a colored skewer with cherries, peach cubes, pineapple wedges, and a small piece of orange alternating on it? It would step up its game and look as much as it costs. \n\nPerformers for the evening:\nNya\nAmber\nBambiana\nAliyah\nV\nLeilani\nTita Aida\nKarmina (doubled as announcer as the evening ended)\n\nWe were treated to 4-5 musical numbers (and quite an eyeful) at 10pm, and once again at 11pm right after they served our ice cream! Right off the bat, I knew Tita Aida would be hilarious. I loved her super woman act first disguised as the elusive Carmen Sandiego! Aliyah was one of our sweet waitresses and she's so pretty. Almost anything goes at this place (within reason) and the birthday boy definitely got his fill of an alcohol shot, whether he liked it or not! My only suggestion would be more crowd involvement during the performances. The guests at the actual bar had a blast though. All the ladies are so nice! \n\nSo many birthdays the night we went! Plus bachelorette parties going strong. \n\nThank you for the complimentary lemon lime shots and a good time unlike any other, Asia SF!

I asked one of them for recommendations and they just said \"everything is good\" which put me off guard since it seemed like they didn't know the menu, couldn't even give me a top 3 or favorite drink... Service overall is pretty good since they check up on you and keep you updated on the food. Weird tidbit is that we were on a set menu, but our main course came before our appetizers. Everyone else had their appetizers before us and we sat down at the same time, so that was off putting.\n\nAnyways, food and drink presentation is pretty cute, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The drinks are definitely on the weak side. The free shot you get with the Yelp check in is sweet an you can't taste the alcohol at all (if there's even any in there).  \n\nI love the downstairs area!

I was not sure how I felt about being a large group attending a birthday party at AsiaSF, but come in with an open mind (and an empty stomach for delicious eats!) and you won't be disappointed!  The entertainment alone is magnificent.  All the ladies are BEAUTIFUL and incredibly talented!  To be able to show stop on the bar and serve and without a bead of sweat in sight... amazing!  It's great to see them as more than just dancers.  By interacting with the ladies as they serve your dinner/apps/drinks, you really get to know each individual personality.  If you don't like dirty jokes... please see the exit!  The food was incredible as well!  I wish I had tried more of the meat options, but I was in a group of largely vegetarian/lacto-ovo vegetarians, so we passed up some of the other eats.  It is extremely close quarters and the room stays really warm.  I wasn't even the one dancing on stage, but I was sweating like crazy!  Because of how many large groups attend, you do feel like you're always running into something - another party, a table, a chair, a server... you name it.  The lounge downstairs was OK but then it ended up being a Latin night while we were there - not much room for variety even when we asked the DJ.  Again, it's once in a lifetime...

Made reservations on  OpenTable so that was easy. Was surprised to find plenty of parking on the street for a Saturday afternoon (4:45 ish) so we metered it for an hour and then it was free after 6. The restaurant is located on the corner of the street and when we arrived, we were surprised to see how small this place was. From the pictures, I imagined it being much bigger, but it was very tiny inside where dinner and the show was. I felt it was very dark inside, so I feel like it took my eyes a while to adjust, but after that, all good. We were seated at the bar since we were a party of 3. We were greeted by our bartender (Walt - great host!) and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We informed them our friend was getting married and they took down her name. After ordering some drinks, we looked over the menu to see what we wanted. Dinner is served as a three course meal. Each person picks an appetizer, entree and dessert. I ordered the Sake steamed mussels, Malaysian Diver Scallops and the Banana Beignets Split. The food was hella good! I was surprised how good it was and it was very filling. During the course of dinner, the ladies of AsiaSF perform on the bar. Although the area is small, they make it work performing to a variety of songs.

I did it with a few friends to celebrate a birthday; she opted for the bachelorette experience, included a red carpet experience sans the paparazzi (bring your cameras).  And if you have a special occasion to celebrate, you may consider this as a spot.  I think literally all the patrons who ate at the same time we did, were celebrating something. \nThere's a couple of shout outs to recognize what you're all celebrating too. (Anniversary, birthday, bachelorette party, ect.)  Which brings me to the first thing, they personalized our menu (yes it's part of a package, but it is a free souvenir to keep as a part of your experience).  Something to note about the menu, it shows about 10 items.  That's what you're getting sent to your table, you don't really order anything UNLESS you need special accommodations, food allergies, vegetarian, ect.  \n\nIt's family style.  The selection was good.  Mainly leaned towards Asian cuisine, but there were things like fillet mignon included.  If anything there was a tad bit too much food coming at us some points throughout the evening.  We had drinks too.  The cocktails all were just great.  Sexkitten seemed to be the most popular at our table, but all of the drinks we had were just great.  \n\nThe show was fun.  Lip synced dance routines, various songs from the 80s, 90's, 2000's.  Of course the ladies. Transwomen are the entertainment, and they love to perform. \n\nThe staff were all courteous.  The dancers also help with the floor service, bringing out your drinks, ect.  Attentive, quick, this was an enjoyable experience from them, not once was I looking for the staff, and thinking that they were understaffed.\n\nWhere this place lost a star for me, was the stools (and bench apparently) are too slippery.  I kept on sliding off to one side; my friend had to use my stool to help brace herself while turned away from the table to watch the girls.\n\nThere's a club below.  We enjoyed the earlier showing, and could retire down below where there is a bar, and dance floor to enjoy the evening.  Again, the music was varied, 80s- current hits, lots of bass to dance to.

As far as service goes I'd say it was okay- though the hosts and waitresses are very inviting it seemed like we had to remind our servers multiple times about the drinks we ordered and that one of the members of our party had cuisines that never came to the table.\nI ordered the Cosmo which they declare as \"world famous\" on the menu. I ended up getting two of them as they were tasty and left feeling pretty tipsy.\n\nFor my first course I got the tuna sashimi and though I am a fan of the sashimi it didn't come with wasabi or soy sauce so I'm a little disappointed.

Again really good\n\nWe didn't really need dessert but of course we ate it since it came with the meal.  Four full size desserts\n- banana beignets\n- bread pudding\n- rice pudding\n- three ice cream cones\nWe all tried a little of everything and it was delicious.  We were stuffed.\n\nAs for the show, always entertaining - high energy.  I am amazed no one has fell off from that bar stage on their high heels.  These \"ladies\" are pretty fun.   This is one of the few restaurants where any night is a good night to come in.  The other time I came here was on a Tuesday and we sat at the bar.  The show that night was even better.\n\nLastly drinks, this was only part that was slightly disappointing.  I got a sake drink that was super sour and then a gang of mule and it was okay.  it's a little hit and miss. What I did like was the free round of kamakazi shots the host brought over.   \n\nOverall, a very fun evening with good friends and unique SF atmosphere. :-)", "author": "Lei H."}

I had booked reservations and that was super easy online, they confirmed my reservations via phone 48 hours in advance. Our group arrived on time and the place looked rather, well, sketchy. We were seated immediately on the bar side of the \"runway\". Our waitress and also performer was nice enough, but bored stiff. She did not give the vibe that she wanted to be there. They have an extensive bar menu and the bartenders were attractive men (I think). Nevertheless, we all chose the prix fixed dinner (3 courses). I don't think you have much of a choice. I had the tuna sashimi (which was a risk considering how this place looked), the filet and chocolate cake for dessert. I stuck with iced tea since it was a work night, but I was in the minority because it seemed like everyone there (aside from our group) was quite inebriated. \nWe placed our order and I checked into Yelp and was pleased to see a free shot offer pop up. I didn't want to waste it (I'm frugal like that and I'm probably never going back), so I ordered it. It took me four times to order it since we were ignored on more than one occasion (remember, she had zero interest in being there). It came eventually and my table mate that imbibed said that the alcoholic beverages were tasty. \nOur food came out shortly thereafter. The sashimi was fresh but tasteless. Presentation was fair. Next was the filet which was an odd gray hue, but it's dimly lit in there. The flavor was fine and it was tender enough. It all tasted like a low-end wedding reception banquet hosted by your wannabe high-end friend. Intermittent between courses there was the famous show. The only girl that had any \"oomph\" to her performance was our server. She gave it her all (she must have been saving her energy since she wasn't giving her all to the table service). The other two had these dead shark eye looks to them and floundered about the stage barely able to lip sync. \nLastly, our desserts were fine - nothing to write home about. The chocolate cake is super rich with a scoop of ice cream to boot. My favorite people there were the food runners. Those boys were super cute and friendly and always had smiles. \nWe had the smell of cigarette smoke wafting in and out of the room. We asked the bartender about it and were quickly dismissed. It stinks in there - I guess that adds to the early eighties ambience of the place. \nWe had a family next to us with really young children. This is not appropriate for kids at all. No one gets naked, but it's a place for adults to go and have a good time. Honestly, they should only allow people of drinking age to be there. \nOverall, I'm glad I went to say I was there. Don't go for the food - go for the experience of San Francisco.", "author": "Janet C."}

So, how was it? Well, the first thing that I think should be clarified is that the \"stage\" is really just a normal bar that runs the length of the dining room. And while the ladies are beautiful and many of their performances quite entertaining (including their spontaneous interactions with the crowd), the show didn't quite live up to expectations. IIRC there are two shows at each dinner seating with each show consisting of about 4 or 5 dancers each doing a dance number for a few minutes. The quality of the shows greatly varied with a couple of really engaging performances and others being easily forgettable. If you're just looking for something beyond the regular dinner or club experience, then you'll be satisfied, but set your expectations appropriately.", "author": "Rodney G."}

We had reservation for the 9:15 show but our group was told to go downstairs and we would get called up, a lot of the group is from out of town so they all had arrived the day of the party. Imagine traveling not having anything to eat and barely getting seated for our reservation an hour later..\nThe food started coming out, half the table got plates and the half are wondering were the rest of plates are. So we ended up asking a server and he said those 6 small plates are to be shared between all 17 starving women. Interesting, so everyone basically received a piece or a spoonful or nothing from the 4 appetizers and 5 entrees. For $62 per person plus 20% gratuity and 4% fee (I forgot what it was for) and a separate bill for drinks which ranged from $10-13, you can imagine the looks on everyone's face when the bill came out. What a shame! Dinner and a show, it should be a called a snack and a show.\nThe show wasn't that great I was bored after the first few girls came out. They dance and lip sing, and wore pretty outfits. I felt the show was mediocre, there could have been more interaction with the audience especially when the package we had purchased had an interactive shot for the bride and a scavenger hunt which we never did, but paid for.

I just thought since we were seated at 3 separate tables that we would get 3 sets of everything.  Therefore, I didn't think it was enough food for everyone.  But the dishes we got were pretty good.. from the ribs to the lamb over coconut rice.  I think there was a wide range of food and selection.  The drinks were $12 a piece and I don't think they had any alcohol in them.  I switched to well drinks afterwards because I thought it was just all juice in the cocktails.  They do try to make you buy lots of drinks though and are pretty attentive in that sense.  Not so much when we asked about the food portions.  The ladies put on a great show.. with lots of dancing to catchy songs.  I thought the show wasn't long enough.. I only remember maybe 4 performers dancing in costume.  The ladies were gorgeous but I think they need to spice it up a little more. If you're in the first sitting, they try to kick you out quick for their second sitting of the night.  Barely enough time to changeover the tables and pay your bill, especially for a large party.  They tell you to go downstairs for the club and you can swing around on the pole - pole is in the VIP area and you can't enter or play on it.. the DJ downstairs played a good selection of music but they had ceiling fans and it got pretty hot after working up a sweat.  They also block off all the seating area after a certain time and there ends up being nowhere to sit.  I guess they just try to make money every way they can... but come on.. we were paying guests for the show/dinner!", "author": "Ivy L."}

We were a group of 6 doing the platinum package for $76/each.  The package consisted of 11 dishes plus 2 dessert.  Food was great!  It was on top of the charts!  They had the signature asian noodles but notasian fushion dishes at all.  Food was pretty much western and yes, pricey for what the servings were.\n\nThe girls.  We come here for the \"show\" and for the price, their dinner show is definitely much cheaper than a Vegas one (well, of course that's Vegas).  But don't expect too much.  It's not a rehearsed, choreographed dance show.  Nothing of that sort.  This was just an open stage for the girls to run across and strut their stuff.  The fact that they're men dressed to be women makes it all entertaining.  \n\nThey have a dance floor and a private room.", "author": "Pam S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-27", "description": "~~PART 1 of 2 (overall impressions, drinks, 1st course)~~\nIt's really all about the entertainment & the show here. I had a fun time & was glad I came, but likely won't come again. I'll be recommending it but only if it fits the occasion, crowd, & expectations. It's a fun experience but keep in mind:\n\n1) For a tranny show, it was pretty tame. They look to please the crowd & don't do anything too raunchy. I saw plenty of people in the crowd who were my parent's age & realized even my conservative Chinese parents might enjoy it here. For tranny shows, this is still a fun beginner's step. (Though the girls are gorgeous!)\n\n2) Their focus is definitely to please bachelorette/birthday-type groups (shout-outs to special events at the end, \"blowjob\" shots where the dancers are great at posing while the friends take pictures).\n\n3) This is also a great place for out-of-towners. They ask several times for all the out-of-towners in the audience to cheer (& not the native SF-ans) & do shout-outs to all the places people have traveled from. So, kind of touristy, kind of kitchy.\n\n4) Try not to sit in the row of table at the \"back\" of the restaurant, behind the bar! The dancers definitely pay 80% of their attention to the other side of the restaurant, so really don't get as much of an experience with the show.\n\nSERVICE: Really sweet, friendly, & great. They checked on us like clockwork. It seemed like they had it down to a science and were churning out the dinner en masse - everyone on our side of the restaurant got their drinks, apps, mains, & desserts about the same time. We saw plates come out not by table, but by dish (i.e. they'd bring out 5 plates of the noodles & distribute it amongst the 4 tables where someone had ordered it). This did make it a tiny, tiny bit annoying that not everyone's dishes came out at the same time, sometimes with a rather large lag (the filet mignon came out a good 5-10 minutes after everyone else's mains). Most of the time it was NBD, just a few minute's difference.\n\nRESERVATIONS: Fairly easy to get reservations with about a week's notice.\n\nCOST: We got a Travelzoo deal (3 course meal for two for $40, valued at $80). With the additional purchase of two drinks & a small side, tax, server tips, and \n\nMUST-HAVES: Potato samosa cigars (1st course), Cool sesame soba noodles (main).\n\nTHE FOOD: Not quite their forte. Their menu online didn't really match what we got at the restaurant, which probably doesn't matter for most people, but I always plan ahead & check the menu & was excited about a few dishes (like the porcupine shrimp) that didn't end up being an option at all.\n\n~~DRINKS~~ \n* Amber's sex kitten $12 - 3.5 stars\n(nigori unfiltered sake, peach schnapps, orange & pineapple juice, grenadine & fresh mint leaves)\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/asiasf-san-francisco?select=cZDYqT0aQpszvDd7hsNdxw#0Q0wcZRoCgRMcFQek71U7A\nVery sweet, tasty, girly! But even my bf liked it.\n\n* Vivica's sidecar - 3.5 stars\n(american honey whiskey & fresh squeezed lemon juice w/ a sugar-rim & a jager-float)\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/asiasf-san-francisco?select=cZDYqT0aQpszvDd7hsNdxw#qyW5dfvQqviuRKmtrnN-GA\nHeavier on the whiskey taste but with a sweet twist.\n\n~~FIRST COURSE~~\n* Dungeness crabcake appetizer - 3.5 stars\n(petite & plump crabcakes, w/ green papaya salad & red curry sauce)\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/asiasf-san-francisco?select=cZDYqT0aQpszvDd7hsNdxw#7OliKjaIgte5aQ_x1-3iqA\nNot bad, not super fresh, but true to their word, very petite! \n\n* Ginger lime seared steak salad - 3 stars\n(thinly sliced beef tenderloin seared & tossed w/ a fresh salad of organic greens, carrots, daikon, cherry tomatoes, seared shiitakes, red onions & a ginger/lime dressing)\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/asiasf-san-francisco?select=cZDYqT0aQpszvDd7hsNdxw#k97tDLBLRCC_4V5kDTavww\nNot enough dressing at all. It seemed like just the plain ingredients plus the steak. And the steak was really hard & cold.\n\n* Aloha tofu salad - 3.5 stars\n(veggie version of above)\nSurprisingly, so much better than the steak version for the simple reason that the tofu was actually recently cooked, warm, & nicely seared!\n\n* Potato samosa cigars - 4 stars\n(filled w/ spiced potatoes & peas, fried until crisp, & served w/ mango & mint chutney dipping sauces)\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/asiasf-san-francisco?select=cZDYqT0aQpszvDd7hsNdxw#btxL43UEiqoGePznh320QA\nReally nice! A good thin wrap with a delicious crunch, soft potato filling, & really tasty dip. I was sharing this with a friend & he poured some of the sauce onto my plate - it was so good w/ its chunks that I was eating it by itself!\n\n~~PART 2 of 2: Mains & Desserts!~~", "author": "Ziyan C."}

I had so much fun during the show. They alone earned the 2 stars for the place.\n\nThe food on the other hand was pretty awful. I didn't have sky-high expectations but I figured I would get some middling but competently prepared fusion food. The steak arrived ice cold. When I was finally able to flag down a server (they seem to avoid eye contact) he nuked it in the microwave so that the potatoes were as hot as the earth's core but the steak was somehow STILL cold. My friend got the orange tofu and she pointed out the paltry 1/3c of hard, dry rice served on the side. \n\nAfter the show there was an announcement that we should go downstairs to the bar to enjoy dancing, drinks, and the stripper pole. When we went downstairs they had roped off the area around the pole for a corporate event, bummer. My party got drinks and sat down in some booth seating to the left of the bar only to be chased out of there by staff saying that they needed this area for a private party too. Our only other seating options were some plastic chairs in front of the DJ booth. If I would have known that all the usable space in the bar area was going to be taken up for private events I would had made my reservation for another evening.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-21", "description": "My low review is partially due to expectations and partially due to cost. I agree that it's a really fun place for a birthday party of bachelorette, but not worth more than one visit. For the most part, the ladies are beautiful (though I've seen better drag queens at an amateur show) and the entertainment pretty good, but you'll only see about 15 minutes of fun over the course of a full dinner. After dinner, you can head downstairs for some more dancing. It is all women and go-go boys dancing. Having seen my share of sexy gay men and drag queens in my day I was not wowed by either and see it for what it is. A pretty mediocre and overpriced dining experience for folks who don't get out much. \n\nThe food costs over $100 per person and while surprisingly good for a divey bar/show, it wasn't amazing. The drinks were laughably weak. They rely way too heavily on the pseudo sex appeal to carry them and on top of the hefty tip added to our hefty bill we were also asked multiple times to include an extra tip for the ladies. In my mind they are the reason we are there paying $100+ for dinner, it's baked into the price. \n\nIn summary, if you're an out of towner and don't usually see drag queens, burlesque shows or gay men and that excites you or your friends then by all means go get it.  Someone mentioned the food is better from the small party menu so perhaps take a look at that menu as my review is only for the large group option.", "author": "Becky S."}

And you get a good amount for $54. I was stuffed by the time dessert came. I really enjoyed the shrimp and herb salad. I love mint! But I didn't really see any shrimp in the salad. The ribs were also tender. And I adore ube, so I enjoyed my mini ice cream cone.\n\nThe show is the reason to come here. These ladies can dance! I wish I looked that good in a skin tight body suit!

After last night unfortunately I don't think I will be back. The ladies are amazing and the show was very entertaining. The food however was very overpriced. I think when they don't even put the prices on the menu that's the first sign they are out to rip you off. We ordered a pitcher of sake for our party. After asking for it a third time we finally received it. Upon getting our bill they charged us for 3 sakes and other additional items that we did not order. The food was ok but definitely not worth $400 for our party of 4. When reflecting on past visits, I recall every time I have visited having to wait for a waitress to help adjust our check.

We had a really great time, so we decided to give it a shot. \n\nOur party was roughly 20 individuals, and AsiaSF was more than willing to accommodate the large party size. We were promptly seated at our reservation time, and began ordering food and drinks. The food all came out quickly, and was not really anything special. The staff all started doing their shows and coming around chatting with all of the patrons. \n\nEveryone was very nice, a little bit pushy, but nice. My wife and I were lucky enough to participate in the event known as taking a \"blowjob shot\" from between the legs of one of the transitioned females while holding onto their enormous silicon breasts. I cannot say it did anything for me, but everyone else at the party had a really great time watching this. I'm fairly introverted, so this was a little bit weird. If you are going here for a celebration of any kind, be prepared to take one of these. \n\nIt's been a while, and we haven't been back, but I probably would be happy to go back assuming there will be no blowjob shot involved.

The restaurant is not very big so I felt a little uncomfortable trying to get out of peoples way and not get food/drinks on my clothes.  \n\nHalf the time my friend kept stating she didn't believe these were transgender women...some of them look like they were woman from birth...absolutely beautiful.  The show was energetic and fun, they do about 3 short sets during your dinner/dessert. They did a beyonce act (of course!), and grease which seemed to be the favorites.  \n\nI wasn't expecting much for the food and I was right. We had the platinum package was served family style and came with:\n\n--Tamarind Chicken Satays\n--Asia-dilla \u00a4\n--Blackened Tuna Sashimi\n--Baby Bok Choy & Shiitakes\n--Grilled Shrimp & Herb Salad \u00a4\n--Miso Glazed Salmon\n--Orange Lamb (or Tofu) \u00a4\n--Baby Got Back Ribs\n--Cool Sesame Soba Noodles\n\nMost of the meats were overcooked, but then again it's a dinner show so they have to roll out a lot of food in a short period of time. I did however enjoy the chicken satay and the Soba Noodle.  \n\nThe servers (transponders/also performers) all had the coolest personalities, the bartenders were very good looking men and everyone in the room seemed to be having a lot of fun.

There were probably about 17 of us, both guys and girls. We arrived around our seating time, which was the earliest, 5:30pm. Before we even walked in, we were treated like stars! They asked us to take photos on the red carpet and gave us the rundown of what to expect that night before showing us to the table. \n\nThe table was all set and on each plate consisted of the menu which was decided ahead of time. We chose the Gold menu which was the cheapest option. Even though we didn't need the menu to order food, it was great and even had a custom message to the Birthday Girl! The side included pictures of all the performers and their signature drinks. The names were unique to say the least.\n\nThe food is served tapas style and was perfectly portioned for 3-4 people. The food came pouring out, and even though we chose the smallest menu set, it was more than enough food. It was not mind blowing delicious but I doubt anyone comes here just for the food. \n\nThere were a few performances followed by a break and then another group of lovely ladies would come on stage. Now I know what you might hear about them being ladyboys but let me tell you, they are GORGEOUS. They all dance and show off their bodies and had me wishing I could look that good. They were even great at involving the audience and making them feel like a part of the show.\n\nI would definitely recommend to those who may be celebrating birthdays, bachelorettes, or even just want to show their out of town guests how San Francisco likes to have fun!", "author": "Michelle L."}

The food tasted like dog food (No, I wouldn't know, but I would probably only feed it to my dog) and I could have got much better food for the same price. The meat was over cooked and chewy. The only appetizer that was half way decent was the quesadilla, but you can't mess up a quesadilla right?\n\nOther than the dog food I ate, the experience was great. I loved the show and the ladies. The service was spectacular as they were very attentive. This place is obviously for celebrations and they made sure to give each and every celebration a shout out.

As a last homage to SF, our Bay Area friends decided that hot asian trannies was a must do before moving away from the city as part of our moving celebrations. With a group of 15 (ladies and dudes) we hit up this popular joint on a Friday night under the premise that it was my bachelorette party. Umm ok- I celebrated that one close to 10 years ago but part deux- why not. \n\nThe design of this restaurant/bar is terrible. The ladies dance on the equivalent of the bar and there's large obstructing poles that have you craning your neck depending on where you have the misfortune of sitting. Asia SF please get yourself a new space. \n\nAs for the ladies. I think most of the reviews have touched upon this. These ladies were hot. Way hotter than most females born with a XX chromosome. Unfortunately the \"talent\" portion of the night involved lip syncing routines to Beyonc\u00e9 and Britney. Yes these ladies were fierce, but I was hoping for something more akin to a Sally Bowles/Cabaret non lip syncing extravaganza, rather than \"Work Bitch.\" Another disappointment- food and drink. There is a gluttonous amount of very poorly made \"Asian food\" provided. Really its terrible. \n\nTo continue the celebration there's a club/dance floor downstairs. We were lured down by free drinks and than realized the sad state of affairs on the near empty dance floor.

We came on a Thursday night and all of the tables were full. Tip - Make prior reservation. \n\nA fun place to celebrate someone's birthday/bachelor's/bachlorettes and watch your friends get roasted! For the birthday person, they serve a free special shot which is to be taken from in between the boobs of the servers. Its quite hilarious to watch!! \n\nBest place to watch the show is sitting at the bar.They have 2 shows per day - at 7.15 pm and 2nd at 9.15 pm. They also have a dance club down stairs for which you get free entry if you dine here. Best nights are Fri/Saturday.\n\nFor the 3-course dinner, we chose -\n\nAppetizer: Duck quesedilla and Dungeness Crabcakes. The crabcakes were too tiny. However, the sauce served with quesedilla was delish.\n\nMain course - We ordered the ribs and filet mignon. Both were tender and flavorful.\n\nDessert - The bread pudding and warm chocolate cake served with ice cream. Definitely go for the chocolate cake!  \n\nPROS:\n1. Unique themed restaurant, good entertainment\n2. Very friendly service with gorgeous ladyboys serving you  \n3. Good show, fun vibe\n4. Best for celebrating birthdays or bachelor/bachlorette\n5. Anyone celebrating any special occasion is treated with a free drink\n\nCONS:\n1. This place is expensive, maybe paying the price for the show ($38 - $60 pp depending on the day)\n2. The food is average, could be better for the price\n\nOverall a fun dining experience!", "author": "Payal B."}

First we had dinner and drinks on the main level. Despite this being more of a club, the 11 course meal was surprisingly good. The portions are kind of small but it's still filling since there's 11 different courses. Plus, it's hard not to get a bunch of cute drinks named after each drag queen. The show was super fun and entertaining. These girls really know how to work it! They really get the crowd into it. Just be prepared to drop some $$$ when you're here. For dinner and drinks, I ended up spending $140. \n\nAfter dinner, you can go downstairs to the club where they play hip hop/top 40 and party til 2am.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-06", "description": "On my last trip to San Francisco, I had picked up a coupon book. In the coupon book there was an ad for this place. I was intrigued, and I remembered standing outside a similar place in Provincetown listening to the laughter, music, and cheers emanate from within that place. So, I decided to go to this place. Not really having the slightest clue of what to expect, I messaged the place on Yelp. The nice guy who replied answered all my questions, and suggested I should make a reservation for my one man party. When I arrived in the city, I called the place to make a reservation for the late night show.\n     I walked the short distance to the place and entered.  The door guy gave me one of those vibrating beeper doohickies, and said 'when it goes off, your table is ready.' He then pointed me down to the bar downstairs. The downstairs bar had a dance floor, flashy lights and blasted new and hip music.  There was also a carafe of water, which I partook of. \n     I had made a reservation at 9:30, and when 9:30 rolled around, my flashy beeper doohickey had not gone off. I ventured upstairs, and they were still cleaning up from the prior show. They stopped me and sent me back downstairs to the bar.  My flashy beeper doohickey went off around 9:45. So...yeah. FYI, the '9:30 show' is more of a guideline than a solid time. The downstairs bar is a holding corral until they're ready.\n     My flashy doohickey went off just about the same time when everybody else's flashy doohickey went off.  I wondered why I needed a flashy doohickey at all. But I followed the stampede upstairs, and was introduced to my waitress, Aliyah.\n       Wow. Holy Carp. She was absolutely smokin hot.  Her halloween outfit consisted of a red tutu, a pitchfork, and some pasties. I did my best not to stare inappropriately, and forced myself to maintain eye contact as I asked for a water, and began to look at the menu for my meal.  The ticket for the show was $48, and that got me a dinner, and entry into the place. Any drinks and tips to the girls was above and beyond that. After I was seated, one of the host guys offered me a seat up at the bar. I politely declined. \n    The menu was actually pretty interesting, and I had a difficult choice picking my three items off of it. I ended up with the Grilled Shrimp Salad, the Glazed Salmon, and the Key Lime Pie.  I tried to be healthy, as I had only eaten large quantities of donuts earlier. The food was well prepared, well presented and pretty dang tasty too. I also re-discovered how to use chopsticks. When I couldn't pick anything else up, I decided I was done with that course. Over the night, I went through the small carafe of water several times. It was refilled quite quickly each time it ran out.\n    The 'entertainment' of the evening was the girls. One by one they would climb up on the bar/stage and dance to their songs. Aliyah was quite energetic and danced and ran around the small space quite quickly, several time I feared she would launch right off the stage and fall, but she was a pro up there. The other girls danced and bounced and seemed to have fun up there as well. Turns out they all had pasties on. They were all talented and all quite well um...built.  Had I bumped into any of them anywhere else, I'd have stared, commented to my friends, and probably whistled to myself.  The '9:30 show' got out around midnight, and I walked back to my Motel 6 afterwards.\n       \n           Overall, It was certainly alot of fun, and I'll probably return for my next trip.", "author": "Scott B."}

Asia SF is pure drag fun with a meal to boot. \n\nOn that note though, the Asian fusion cuisine isn't anything to write home to mom about. You're really paying for entertainment. We ordered some cocktails while deciding on our meal and got complimentary shots for checking in on either Foursquare or Yelp. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=QE8M86a8sRQzISwXy5kGIw) Drinks are named in honor of the performers and I thought they were decent but a tad too sweet perhaps. \n\nWe started with a couple of apps. The blackened tuna sashimi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=C4yG1nPYCZolmdEdMP_7_Q) sounded promising but it ended up being pretty pedestrian but fresh though. The porcupines (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=5E6o9NEf4RuY05SX9vPtww) were nice little crispy fried pieces of shrimp, veggies and cellophane noodles. Served with a sweet plum sauce, it was a nice combination of sweet and savory. The standout app though was the sake steamed mussels. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=B3zMb-NzPtCLdj5VFTKQNA) There was not enough bread for me to soak up the sake-curry-lime broth. The mussels were also delicious - just the right amount of time in the steamer. \n\nI had the sansho spiced filet mignon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=cKeTT8Oh1AubJIgO9rErvQ) for my main and it was alright. My favorite thing of the dish was the grilled eggplant. I thought the meat was a little tough but well seasoned and the potato stars seemed a little gimmicky. My friend had the miso glazed salmon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=2-46pk--D8rR6FRaWl3DxA) and she seemed to enjoy it. My bite of it combined with the wild rice revealed a nice combination of flavor. Definitely recommend it over the filet mignon.\n \nThe stars at Asia SF are the performers. They'll have you in stitches with their audience interaction and snarky humor that only a drag queen can dish out with such oomph.

We had a preset menu of 5 sets of appetizers, 3 main courses, and cute little ice cream cones for dessert for 8 of us ladies to share.

While bosoms galore and the ladies aren't shy to strut it (and they definitely GOT it), the food leaves my palate way less than satisfied.  \n\nShort version:\n\nBartenders: 2.5 stars\nFood: 2.5 stars\nLadies of Asia SF: 5 stars\n\nFree signature shot with check in on Yelp. They have 3 different kind of signature shot, Kamakazi, Passion Splash and Purple Shooter.  We had 2 bartenders and we showed them our yelp check in shot and the first guy  (Paul) didn't feel like explaining what their signature shot is and basically left to help others.  WTF!  20 minutes later, I inquired the other bartender, who was nicer and took the time to explain the 3 diff kinds and we ended up choosing the Passion Splash, it was really delicious!\n\nThey had problems with their sound system so the show was delayed and the bartenders made free kamakazi shots for everyone.  Great, right?  NOT.  They served everyone except for the patrons sitting at the bar.  Again, WTF.  We had to flag down a server to get our free shot.  Lame x 100.\n\nMy steak salad was pretty good but the dressing tasted like diluted soy sauce, yuck.  My friend's shrimp salad was also relatively tasty.  I had high hopes for our entrees that dashed to the ground the minute I took my first bite of the scallops.  The scallops were limp, tasted previously frozen, and was dunked in a sea of orange mush.  I think I've had better lean cuisine meals than this.  Gross!  My friend's orange lamb was a little better but also of below average quality.   Major bummer.\n\nWe chose the muscat as our dessert and it was served in a 2 ounce shot glass?  Really?  \n\nSo we were ignored by our bartenders most of the night even though we sat right in front of them and they weren't busy by any means.  But the dancing ladies of AsiaSF sure made up for some of the crappy food and service.  They were sexy, vivacious and just plain fun!  My friend and I had a great time despite the below average food and service.  Oh Asia SF, come on, for the prices you charge, I think you can step up in the kitchen and service.

This place was amazing. Our reservation was for 7 and a dinner selection was pre-chosen that included lots of menu items. It requires a minimum party of 6 to feast the way we did, or I would have already returned to eat again.  \n\nI can't say enough good things about the food. Everything was served in a shared manner but there was plenty enough for everyone to get a taste of it all. And a TON of food was brought out. There was nothing that we didn't enjoy. The special requests of one veggie/gluten-free girl were also catered to.  A boutiquey place like this could totally get away with a crap meal because you're mostly there for the show. We were all surprised at the quality of food. And the drinks! They were great! We received a comp shot for our bachelorette party celebrations and some of us received an additional one for checking-in on Yelp. Heck yes!\n\nThe show was hot. The ladies were smokin'! And the male staff (like the guy bussing our table with the snakebite piercing)... they were all gorgeous too!  How does it feel being really, really, ridiculously good looking?  \n\nEverything about the night was special. They even personalized our menu so that we could keep it as a keepsake. We interacted with lots of staff and they were all very attentive and friendly.\n\nAfter dinner, we went downstairs and danced in the nightclub. Free admission with dinner. The vibe was awesome! I wish we had stayed longer than we did but the bachelorette celebrations continued elsewhere.  I've already started working on a group of 6 for a return. Can't wait to eat here again and oogle all the sexy dancers some more.", "author": "Amy S."}

The bar seats are fairly cramped and not exactly what you would consider comfortable. It didn't take long before I started getting used to the more intimate atmosphere. Everyone from the bartenders to the dancer 'ladies' were extremely friendly and approachable. They took time to talk to all customers and noted any special occasions/requests. You get the feel that they were working hard to make you feel like a valued customer. \n\nThey really made great use of the small venue. The best seats in the house are at the bar. The performance was very energetic and the dancers were all lovely. There were no awkwardness and it is absolutely not a freak show in case you are wondering. Some ladies were celebrating her birthday there and got a 'blowjob' served by one of the lady. To be honest, I was quite envious. Why didn't I get that for my birthday! I am considering taking my mom here for hers. I think she's going to have a great time.\n\nThe most surprising thing of all, is the food. I pretty much expected food to suck given the nature of the venue. It didn't. Not all dishes are great but everything was acceptable. The salmon was nicely made and better than what I had at many restaurants. Rice pudding dessert was tasty.", "author": "Mona W."}

When you arrive, you'll either be sat at the bar or a table.  I prefer the bar for a smaller group because of the fabulous view you get of the show.\n\nThe bartenders will start you off with whatever cocktail you order.  They are also extremely friendly, fun, and will strike up a conversation with you.  Next, you'll order your prix fixe meal.  Start off with an appetizer, get a show from the ladies.  The entrees will then come out...then another show.  Finally, you'll have some dessert.\n\nIf it's your birthday, you get a free shot!  It just depends how you want to take it.  If you're sitting at the bar, the bartender will offer to take a shot with you or you can ask for a \"BJ\" via boob or in between legs...take your pick!\n\nThe pricing isn't too bad considering the awesome service, food, and atmosphere.  The food is rather yummy especially the mussels!!!

I had some friends visiting SF for the weekend so we gave them an appropriate welcome message on top of the menu. \n\nI'm pretty much in 100% agreement with the general consensus of the other Yelpers here - the girls of AsiaSF are a blast but the food is somewhat of a letdown and low in quantity. My shy friend got pulled into the stage by one of the performers and it gave me one of the biggest laughs I've had in a long time. \n\nI'd be willing to bring out of town visitors here again, but it's definitely not for everybody.

From what I know, this place has been around for quite a long time. But, like other reviews everything that needs to be said has pretty much already been said. Here are a few highlights that I really enjoyed. \n\n1. I told the waiter I was allergic to peanuts, and they made sure to notify me of each dish I needed to stay away from. We did the Diamond Package, so the meal was a pre-fixe, but they also customized the menu offering off menu items to accommodate my allergy. \n\n2. It was my friend's birthday and they comped his meal on the bill. \n\n3. Provided ample amount of food for family style dining.\n\nThe service here is impeccable, and the food exceeds expectations. One criticism I have is surrounding the table seating. The stools do not create a very comfortable dining experience. Also, we had a table of 9 and it was a bit cramped. \n\nOverall, this place is a lot of fun. My friends and I come here once a year to celebrate a birthday, and once again this place delivers.

There were a lot of men there too, which I thought was pretty cool, everyone was having a great time.  \n\nDinner was small plates, and a ton of food.  We did the Platinum menu, which is the middle one and everything was really good.  Plenty of food, we actually boxed up the last few plates that arrived, we were so full.

We had flown into the city to get married on a Friday Morning, in July of 2008 when Marriage Equality had just became legal (for the 1st time(.   The restaurant seemed to be a takeoff of the \"Luck-Chang\" restaurant that was once popular in New Orleans.. Asian Drag Queens took your order with attitude.   \n\nBecause there were only two of us we reserved seating at the Bar and found it Most Enjoyable..  (The tables were mostly for bridal parties  having there last wild night out.. It was fun to see them all having a blast)  We were able to see an improtu show of the \"girls\" dancing down this runway between the center of the restaurant, and got the additional surprise of seeing Margret Cho prance into the bar, jump on the runway and dance with the girls.\n\nOh.. And when we were being seated we were ask Why were at the restaurant... We told them about us just getting married (This was still a big thing in 2008).. Later in the night they made an announcement over the PA system giving us best wishes on our marriage!\n\nWe had a great time and will visit again!", "author": "Bryan S."}

We had a number of ladies come serve our table and they were quick to make the birthday girl take shots from their boobs, which she loved! \n\nThis was such a fun atmosphere.

I called for reservations ahead of time and chose the platinum menu.  I believe there is a $35 cancellation fee per person that does not show up.\n\nFriday night 9pm.  A photographer was outside ready to take our pics in front of this asiasf backdrop.  Got his card and will look for them on facebook.  Then we went to the lounge downstairs to get a couple of drinks before we were seated.  \n\nWe crammed 16 people onto 2 tables.  It was a little uncomfortable but not a big deal because everything else was amazing.  Since I chose the platinum menu, everyone had a beautiful personalized menu saying \"Happy Birthday, Angelica.\" It was really cute.  It was a set menu and the food is served family style.  I thought it was very considerate of them to ask if there were any vegetarians or food allergies before the food was served.  There was enough food to go around for everyone.  I enjoyed everything, particularly the truffled soba noodles and the lamb.  I typically hate lamb, but this lamb was prepared perfectly.  I loved the dessert!  We had ice cream cones and warm banana beignets.\n\n$67 total with tax and tip for each person.  They put the drinks on a separate tab.  \n\nThe ladies there are beautiful and hilarious and so nice.  Since we were a huge table, it was hard to talk to everyone in my party but it was nice that there was a show that all of us could watch together.  The show consists of the ladies lip syncing and dancing on the bar.  The bar is in the middle and all the tables surround it so everyone had a good view.  The ladies were very willing to take pictures with us at the end.\n\nAfterwards, we went back to the lounge downstairs.  The bathrooms are a lot nicer upstairs than they are downstairs.  There's a pole down there if you want to show off your skills.  It wasn't crowded at all.  I wouldn't come back here just to go to the lounge, but it's a fun thing to do if you don't want to go home after dinner right away.\n\nI think i'll end with saying that it was one of the best birthdays I've had!", "author": "Angelica T."}

We ordered our 3 courses each, and then came the big surprise!  Dancers!!  It was so much fun and such great energy.  I wanted to hang out here all night.  I had the mussels, which were abundant, my husband and I both gorged ourselves and couldn't finish the bowl.  The broth they swam in was addictive as crack, we had to order more garlic bread to sop it all up.  My husband had the tuna sashimi app, which was good in its own right.  \n\nOn the entree, I got the Dungeness crab cakes - Hello, luvahs!  Full of tasty crab and bursting with flavor!  He had the filet mignon, which was cooked nicely and flavored well.  Dessert was the banana smore ice cream goodness and chocolate cake - WOW.  \n\nI might also mention there is a killer wine list with a very reasonable markup, we were so pleased we had two bottles.

FABULOUS FOOD, SERVICE, AND ATMOSPHERE!!\n\nI've been here twice and it was all in one week. It was my birthday and since we had more than six people, we had a pre-set menu. The menu had my name and Happy Birthday printed on it as well! What a nice touch! It does get a bit pricey when you have a bigger party. They have you go to the lounge area downstairs where you can dance and drink while waiting for a table. The people down there were cool too and gave us free drinks after dinner!!\n\nYou would think at this place the people would be rude because they have such a unique gimmick . . . WRONG!! I had the best service in my life at this place!! When sitting at the bar, the bartender was so sweet and kind! He gave us free drinks and wanted to take pictures with us. He got the \"girls\" to come so we could take pictures with them. I recommend the flavored sake!\n\nSpeaking of the girls, I swear to god I would never think some of them were actually men. They made me look bad as a woman. I wish I could be as pretty as some of these girls, plus I give them a lot of props for dancing in high heels on a bar. \n\nThey want you to make reservations so you make at least two of the shows. Each show has three dances unless it is the last one, which usually has more. They will announce the names of people celebrating stuff. Sometimes the girls will let you do shots off of their bodies if it is your birthday. It's actually pretty funny!!\n\nEverything on the menu is good! I especially love the potato stars (separate side dish), Grilled Herb and Shrimp Salad, Orange Lamb with Cucumber salad, the banana beignets (best dessert there! I don't even like bananas), and the ice cream cones (coconut, taro, and jackfruit flavors). \n\nGo here if you want an experience of a lifetime!!!", "author": "Hang T."}

I've heard so many good things about this place. So when I saw it on Groupon: 3 course dinner and show for for $45 for Sun-Thurs, I thought it was a steal! Excitedly, I planned a night out with my coworkers to go on a Thursday (last night)we were all super stoked because we were all first timers.\n\nFirst, we were greeted by our waitress who goes by Tara (asian blonde that has a fob accent)who's  also one of the performers,  had a nasty attitude from the beginning. Maybe it was because she was serving girls and not men?  Maybe it was because we werent VIP? As if we didnt drop money to be there. No excuse though. I misheard her name and said Teri and in the sassiest tone she snapped at me and said UM NO, IT'S TARA. Okay, this is my first time seeing these type of performers/ servers that are known for being these attractive drag queens. I was admiring her and complimented her about her outfit pointing to her bralette and she snapped again and said DON'T TOUCH ME! Like wtf?! I was surprised and didn't react immediately because I was shocked. Not to mention embarrassed in front of my coworkers. She made it seem that I was groping her or disrespecting her which I wasn't. Clearly, you can see in their pictures of men doing shots in the performers breasts, getting a lapdance, touching audience members/ vice versa and you gonna tell me don't touch you? Bitch please. On top of that the waitress right next to us that was serving a table of men was super flirty and touchy with her customers... just saying. Not that I expected that, but you're an entertainer/ performer, she should not be working with that attitude. That already set the mood and I was not a happy camper. I was disappointed in the performances, the food and the service that was provided. She never came to check up on us after delivering the food. I'm so happy I didn't pay the full price! I would've been more pissed! Definitely not worth it.", "author": "Elle C."}

I have personally been excited for over a month. When you first get there they have a red carpet set up with an Asia SF backdrop and a photographer will take your picture. Very cool way to start out. We are led inside by beautiful he ladies. We are seated and you'll notice that the place is very cozy, meaning  you're almost face to face with the table next to you. But it's also like one big family so everyone's cool with it. The are told the food is served family style and you place your order for all three courses and your drinks with your server when you're seated. \n\nThe drink menu is big and each drink is named after a different girl at the restaurant. I ordered the Karminas kiss, and it was delicious.\nOur three course meal:\n\nAppetizer: I ordered the Asia-dilla which had duck, jack cheese, peppers and served with sun-dried cherry creme fraiche. Not a bad way to start out. We also had the sesame steak salad, which was my second favorite right after the Tamarind chicken satay. Those were absolutely amazing. The fourth thing we had were salmon burgers which were actually very tasty.\n\nEntree: I ordered the sansho spiced filet mignon which was delicious but the sauce really made the dish for everyone at the table. We also had the scallops which were nice, and the \"baby got back\" ribs also very good. My personal favorite was my beef but I think everyone pretty much liked there own for this one. \n\nDessert: The desserts were amazing. The perfect finale to this wonderful show. I ordered a key lime pie tart which was PERFECT. We also tried a warm chocolate cake that leaves any chocolate freak satisfied. This was also my first time trying bread pudding and I have to say I'm a fan, at least here I am.  But I think the star of the dessert round was the banana beignet split. \n\nSo besides a fabulous meal you get to watch these gorgeous she men dance across the bar to a multitude of songs.

I went here over the weekend for a friend's birthday.\n\nBefore going here I knew what to expect.  The entertainment (dancers) on top of the bar was enjoyable.  Some of the girls are pretty hot and you really can't help but do a double take.  \n\nThe drinks are creative and there is a really wide variety.  I think they have about 20 signature drinks and a few basics.  Price ranging from about $6 - $12.  I had a small sip of a strange whiskey concoction that was overly sweet and not stiff enough.  \"Vicki's sidecar\" I believe it was called.  Unfortunately the service is S$%#!  Considering our party of 20 you'd think they'd cool off on the catty attitude when asking us for drinks and serving.  It seems their on stage persona is translating down to their service.\n\nThe food is a strange Asian fusion.  The best thing I think I tasted that night was the cucumber salad that came with the orange lamb.  Being a birthday we had a special birthday menu I believe.  There was a good amount of food.  Tapas style.  I can't list everything because I don't think I even got a chance to try everything, or maybe there just wasn't anything that really left an imprint.  I do remember however, the food all tasting very similar from dish to dish.  Very artificial tasting, but I understand they are not known for their food.\n\nI can't say that I would recommend this place to anyone.

I must admit, when we first walked in to the restaurant, I was pretty surprised- it had a very outdated/basement-lounge feel whereas I was expecting more upscale? I will say that all of the girls are beautiful and very friendly which was great and we felt very welcome upon entering and being seated. We came on a Thursday night and all of the tables were full. \n\nFood: 1 star(eek, methinks NOT): The dinner menu varies based on party size( as we had less than 6 guests, we fell into the Menage A Trois Menu in which you choose a first course, main and a dessert. The larger your group, the more courses included.To start, I went with the tamarind chicken satay which was good, not that you can go wrong with plain grilled chicken that can be dipped into a peanut sauce. For my main I went with the ribs which were NOT tender, but so tough, it was nearly impossible for me to get the meat off of the bone to the point that I actually gave up and didn't eat my main course. For dessert, I went with the warm chocolate cake which was yummy, but nothing to write home about. \n\nDrinks: SO SWEET* I ended up having 2 of their cosmos as this is definitely one of those places where you can have way more fun the more intoxicated that you are, however, wound up just feeling sick without any buzz. Since we checked in on yelp, they gave us a complimentary kamikaze shot which was yummy, but as all of their drinks, super sweet! \n\nAs we were celebrating a birthday, they did a special shoutout at the beginning of the show and also  gave an \"interactive shot\" in which they had the birthday boy take a shot between their legs and place his hands on their boobs-- hilarious for us to watch, sort of mortifying for the participant. It seemed as though everyone that was there was celebrating something which helped make it more of a fun atmosphere. \n\nThe show: ehhh, the girls were gorgeous, but there wasn't much of a show? They basically just walk around the bar and lip-sync to songs. I've been to far better shows in P-Town and NYC.", "author": "Kayla C."}

I'm not sure why women love to see men dressed as women dance, but I just accept it.\n\nThe food was actually surprisingly good, and I ate heartily. \n\nThe \"women\" don't really look like women, everything about them from their lips to their breasts to their asses are \"overdone\" and \"oversized\".

Then why 2/5? If everything ok I totally agree than they deserve 4/5 but we went there with Groupon as a group of two. The Groupon deal was 2 starter, two main and one deserts for two (value of $96). We ordered two cocktails each ( 4 x $12 = $48). The bill came out with no Groupon which was around $160 which is ok. After we asked regarding Groupon, they changed the bill. Bill went higher and the Groupon deal was cut and the bill came to $100 for 4 cocktails. Go and figure. A clue: they added fees and mandatory %20 tips on the bill so it came to $100 for 4 cocktails. Groupon charged you $55 for $96 value. If you go with groupon or without your out of pocket money is almost the same. I usually don't appreciate when groupon deal changes everything. Again, the service and show and other things were good and they could have easily won our trust by being honest with the deal they offer but it did not happen.", "author": "Yashar M."}

In order to reserve our seats, a credit card had to be given, but it wasn't charged. \n\nOur little party of three arrived for reservations at 9:30pm on a Friday. We were all asked for our IDs at the door, so make a note not to forget your ID. Apparently for parties of 3 or smaller, standard seating is at the bar, which in my opinion, was the best view in the house! *Downfall to bar seats, were the extremely uncomfortable bar stools. I was wearing a shorter cocktail dress and heels...If I did these seats over again, I would have worn a longer dress or possibly even pants with some more comfortable shoes.\n\nWe were served our cocktails right away. We all three ordered from the bar menu. Each and every one of their specialty drinks were full of sugar, and tons of super sweet fruit juices. Nothing was just-- mellow or down to earth at this place. ;-) The three of us decided on the prixe fixe \"menage -a-trois\" special. Each of us picked an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert or dessert wine. \n\nI personally ordered the \n\nAppetizer:\nBlackened Tuna Sashimi- seasoned, seared ahi tuna with a lemongrass beurre blanc & pickled vegetable salad\n\nMain Course:\nOrange Tofu\nlamb sirloin (or tofu) saut\u00e9ed with a spicy orange glaze served with coconut jasmine rice & Thai cucumber salad\n\nDessert:\nGraham's Six Grapes Reserve Port \n\nHonestly, I was expecting the food to be mediocre, and the show to be the main reason for going. Wow.. AsiaSF, what a pleasant surprise! Food was surprisingly delicious and cooked to perfection. The sashimi and even the ginger on the side was very fresh! Yum! \n\nSo moving on to the best part of AsiaSF-- if you are male, female, shemale or whatever you are; I think you would be impressed by the show the performers put on here. Some of these \"women\" are the most beautiful and talented \"women\" I have seen ever!! It is mind blowing to watch them, and see them keep the attention of the entire room-- ladies and men all at once!! I was completely impressed with their dancing, their make up, their hair, and the organization of their entire show with each and every performance.

If you've looked this place up, I'm sure you already know what you're in for. A lot of people come here for bachelorette parties and birthdays, so there's a pretty fun and happy vibe in this place. If you're interested in coming here, definitely make reservations because I don't think they take walk-ins. This place looks kind of sketch and old on the outside, but it's totally different when you walk in.\n\nWe were greeted my one of the \"ladies\" there and we were immediately seated. The ladies working there introduced themselves and the menu to us. Since we had a large party (party of 6), our menu was set and eaten family style. They'll also print out your event on the menu (it was pretty hilarious because we didn't really have a reason to come, but my friend just said we just graduated so they put \"Happy Graduation!\" on the menu). They'll also do shout-outs of every table in the beginning and at the end. \n\nWe arrived at 7PM and it took about an hour for the show to start even though it's supposed to start at 7:30. The food came about 15 minutes before the show, and you can eat while the show is happening. The shows were pretty good, but they were a bit short (one set was like 15 minutes). There's two sets and there's a break in between. They serve most of the food before the show starts. \n\nI wasn't expecting much from the food, but it was surprisingly good. My favorite from our menu was the Duck Quesadillas. The sauce that came with it was also good. There were a few items that didn't really stand out, but it was definitely better than what I was expecting. Also, their drinks weren't bad. Remember to check in on Yelp for a free shot! Although the shots were vodka-based, they were pretty tasty! My friend also ordered a Mojito and she said she really liked it. \n\nOverall, the whole experience was about 3 hours. But really, I think the \"shows\" took 45 minutes max. The service there was also pretty, and most of the servers were on top of it. Amber, our main waitress and lady, was so nice and her performance was amazing! However, I think it was a little much for the overall experience (though it may be because I'm a broke college student). For 6 people, we paid about $54 each, which is a little expensive for a short show (but to be fair, it did include a dinner). It's definitely fun if you're coming for a birthday party or a bachelorette party, since it gives you a reason to splurge. Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. Everything was great, but I think with the mandatory service fees and everything, it was just a little expensive for what you get, hence -1 star. \n\nBy the way, you can also request a free chocolate liquor shot with whipped cream from the ladies ;) Just ask!", "author": "Helen T."}

We ordered food, others got drinks and the lights dimmed starting the show. The entertainers are pretty amazing dancing on a bar with 4 inch heels, a talent I wish even I had. They also do a good job of getting everyone rowdy. Don't be surprised as you question them or yourself even, they are great gender illusionist you'll wonder how they do it! After the first show, there is a break and a second mini show plus introduction to each entertainer and dessert is on. If you do get dessert you cannot pass up the ice cream trio consisting of; Macupuno, Jackfruit and Ube. As well as the ice cream sundae with banana beignets.\n\nThere are also special treats for the birthday kids- by kids I mean adults (preferable 18 and over) and boas for those feeling oh - so - pretty for the night.\n\nSkip is one of the owners, he looks like Andy Warhol and is absolutely hilarious.

A majority of the \"women\" that work there are damn beautiful. We're talking long legs, toned, tanned, and big boobies. They are all insanely friendly to boot. \n\nWe got the Menage a Trois which is three course meal consisting of the first course, main course, then dessert all for $38. I started off with the sake steamed mussels. This was definitely a main course in terms of portion. I didn't want it to ruin my appetite before the main course even came but I tried my best and was only able to finish half of it. The mussels are served in a bowl of spicy red curry-kafir lime leaf broth. They provide you with mini-forks to use to fork out the mussels from the shells. They came off with so much ease it just made me that more excited to get down to business! The mussels were so juicy and it definitely brought the heat. The lime flavor was very strong. If you can't take spicy then this dish isn't for you. The garlic bread is also included inside the bowl. In my opinion, the two didn't go together but the bread was good nonetheless. \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Miso Glazed King Salmon. The sauteed miso glazed Pacific Salmon was served on top of a sweet tomato-edamame salad with this scary looking black rice sandwiched inbetween. The tomato-edamame salad tasted very fresh but it didn't have much flavor to it. Don't let the black rice scare you. It looks like wet rabbit poop but it is actually very tasty. I liked the idea of meshing the cold salad with the warm rice. It wasn't something my palette was used to. I don't normally order Salmon when I go out because most places cook it until the fish is dry and flakey. The fish was very moist and tender. The texture was almost like biting into a very tender piece of chicken.\n\nFor dessert, I got the warm chocolate cake which was a chocolate cake with a melted chocolate ganache filling. It's served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, topped with chocolate and butterscotch sauce. You also get a few raspberries. The chocolate was very rich and the chocolate filling makes it that much more sweeter. Now I understand why they serve it with vanilla bean. The chocolate can be too much so it's highly suggested that you eat it with the vanilla bean. \n\nTheir drinks are very strong and they all have dirty names to them. I think they name a drink after each \"lady\" that has worked there. I remember seeing some martini which may have had a woman's name and may have had the word bush in it. On top of this three course meal, you get a wonderfully entertaining show. Each lady will come out twice in their little costumes and dance across the bar with their selected song. Just the show alone is worth every penny that you're going to spend here. If you happen to come with a large party, you should definitely go downstairs and check out their club. \n\nOne cool tidbit: I won't have to go all the way up north for Asia SF anymore because they're going to open one up in Hollywood soon!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

What bothered me was when one of the ladies was going around to the birthday guests and bachelorette party guests she completely missed my friend. I figured maybe they had to grab more shots? But no, they forgot about it all together. We had to ask them to come back to give her a shot. \n\nThe food was just ok, price fixed menu for around $70 a person. I can get a better slice of pizza for $3 down the street. Which I wish I would have instead of spending that much money on food that was just ok. Be warned drinks are not included in the $70 charge per person, that's solely food. \n\nThe show was entertaining. The ladies are very beautiful and even fooled some of the guys we were with. But, it seems like they single out the same people over and over again. They generally only interact with the people sitting closest to the stage, which is a bummer. \n\nOverall, this venue is highly over priced. It's fun to go see it once in your life.

A group of friends came up to visit and I felt they did a pretty good job of personalizing the experience for us. We came on a weekday, and it wasn't very crowded at all. They made a menu with our group name on it which was a nice touch!\n\nAfter all of the hyper I've heard about this place, I was somewhat disappointed by both the food and the performances. The ladies were wonderful to speak and interact with at the table, but their lip synching/ pseudo-dancing  on stage left a lot to be desired. I do wonder if on a more crowded night, the experience would have been different as the girls seem to feed of the energy of the crowd.\n\nThe food was just OK. For the price, definitely not worth the cost (you're paying for the show). We had a pretty large tasting menu with a pretty large amount of food (about $30 pp), but nothing really really shined, except for the ice-cream desert at the end. Some of the food tasted as though it had just been reheated in a microwave.\n\nBecause we checked in on Yelp, they did give us a free shooter, which was a nice touch (all the shooters have \"sexy\" names too!

Or bachelor parties that I can please be invited to? If not, get ready for my 30th. April 1, 2014 it is going down. \n\nI almost don't want to explain the awesomeness as the surprise soooo adds to the fun. But I will just say, if you are a good friend don't read beyond this point. Wait until Christmas morning. It makes it better.\n\nOkay, so for everyone else: free check in shot. What a way to start! I did find the menu entertaining. Half food (you pick your menu for your group ahead of time) and half specialty drinks named for one of the waitresses. They were a bit, hmm, how to say it nicely, skanky looking. Like heavy makeup, making sexy faces. A bit odd, but I happily perused the drinks. One of the girls ordered a sex kitten. Fun. I got something with a jager float that was surprisingly nice. They started bringing out appetizers that were pretty damn good. A wide variety from shrimp roll type things and chicken satay, an excellent asiadilla with a fabulously flavorful aioli dipping sauce. It just kept coming. \n\nThen the entertainment began and I realized these waitresses where certainly not just waitresses and maybe a few other, um, \"things\" about them weren't quite as they appeared. Let the dancing begin. Now let me say, these were classy dancers. There wasn't stripping. Though there were body shots out of the crotch area. But I mean, they did it as classily as possible. Thus the quote of the night: \"When in Rome, take a shot off of a drag queen.\" And that our one male companion did. \n\nLove, love, loved this place. We even ended with little ice cream cones.

Pricey, pricey, pricey!  Employee mandate tax, food & drinks tax, automatic 20% gratuity.... taxes and extra charges alone were up to $100!!!!!  If the place wasn't so darn pricey, I would have given a 4 star review, but for the short stint of time / entertainment, it's just too steep for my pockets.  (If money is of no issue at all, and you can easily throw it at entertainment -- yes, go! -- you'll be entertained, and   the food is delicious!!! (But, at discount price only -- I definitely would have felt ripped up to pay full price for the food -- portions being on the smaller side).\n\nOur table was quite disgruntled about the bill, and had the manager come first -- and later the owner.  I do have to say that both the manager, and the owner, were very kind and respectful in handling our unhappy table.  The owner seemed frustrated, but really did want to do the right thing in the end, and did offer to discount our bill (beyond the coupon).  \n\nPart of the frustration on our table's part, was that \"with\" a coupon -- they automatically slap on a 20% service charge, and \"without\" a coupon -- they do not.  We had asked to see a neighboring table's bill, and noticed the huge discrepancy in \"service charge\" amount, and that likely set the ball rolling, into a feeling of \"unfairness\" with having a coupon along.\n\nEven at home, sitting down going over our bill... we can NOT figure out where all the taxes and service charges come from.  It appears that gratuity was even added to the tax! ... no idea, the #'s never add up, any which way we figure out the bill.\n\nBasically WITH coupon (1/2 price meal) plus 2 drinks / person = $95 per person.\n\nWITHOUT coupon (full price meal - Fri night) plus 2 drinks / person = $115 per person.\n\n\nI would go again (if others were planning a gathering there) -- I am not much more aware of the \"SHOCKER\" bill, to come, at the end of the night.  I think the owner handled it very well -- he seems like he genuinely wants his patrons to leave feeling happy (or at least not ripped off) -- he cares about his business.", "author": "Tina I."}

From the Asian fusion fare to the beautifully outlandish transgender flair, what's not to love?!\n\nFUN OVER FOOD\nIn my honest opinion, the food was good but not memorable--just your ordinary Asian-fusion cuisine. I have no gripes with the food at all.  Actually, I remember liking whatever it was I ordered..\nAnyway, one came here for the fun and unique experience, not the food. But great food and cocktails are always added bonuses!!\n\nKIMORA\nOur server was jaw-dropping and looked identical to Kimora Lee Simmons! She was so sweet and the LOAD of fun! We took pictures and posed with each other as if we were bombarded by paparazzi. Girls are so vain. :)\n\nTRANSGENDER FLAIR\nWhen it came time for the show I was flabbergasted--all these beautiful women were transgender! It was a sight to see. They (most of them) were gorgeous! Each lady did their own number--dancing and strutting their stuff--along the bar. \n\nSO MUCH FUN\nI failed to mention earlier whom I had been dining with--my mom and a couple friends. It was a bit awkward at first, but I got over it. (We were having so much fun that the awkwardness was soon forgotten.)\n\nI was a bit sad when it was time to leave. I had made a new friend--Kimora!

We saw 6 performers, each one just got better and better.  Awesome tracks by Beyonce, Katy Perry and more were performed in epic scale by the AsiaSF ladies up on the bar in the center of the restaurant.  The performers double as your servers, and are as friendly and helpful as they are beautiful and fun!  Don't come here with any inhibitions, cuz they will only get in the way.  Enjoy the show, let loose and have fun!\n\nTHE EATS & DRINKS - We scored half-price vouchers from Travelzoo which were a big help, cuz with our 3 course meal for 4 diners plus cocktails, our bill was well over $200.  A Yelp check-in will also score you a free signature shot, which is tasty and sexy, served up in a cordial glass for extra glam.  The vouchers covered the 3-course 'Menage a Trois' meal.  For apps, we sampled the tamarind chicken satay (my favorite by far), ahi salmon burger, asia-dilla and steak salad.  All are tasty but the chicken is a knockout.  For entrees, we had the Baby Got Back ribs (oh yes they did!), scallops and filet mignon.  All portions are designed to share so have fun with the menu and take the whole tour.  The ribs were KILLER, falling off the bone and finger lickin' good.  For desserts, we had the banana beignet split, bread pudding, warm chocolate cake and the key lime pie tart.  All were yummy but my heart belongs to the banana beignets, YUM!  Beware - cocktails are delicious but not cheap.  The signature cocktails named after the ladies are $12 a pop, so also a good reason to plan accordingly and visit with people you like so you can take sips all around.  My drink, something about a Pussycat, was delicious and went down way too easy!  \n\nAfter a great dinner and fun show (BTW plan a few weeks out and make reservations if you want to visit on a Friday or Saturday night, you will not set a toe inside without one), you get to head downstairs for a totally free nightclub!  I joked that this was literally the only club in California that was totally jumpin' at like 9:15 at night, when most floors are dead empty.  Great DJ, and tons of awesome positive energy.  \n\nAsiaSF is serious one stop shopping for an entire night of not cheap but certainly fun that is worth every penny.

Price was: $60 but we ended up paying $90 (with drinks)\n\nFood: The only thing I remembered was good was their \"baby got back\" ribs, which I only had one small piece of, the rest of their food sucked and the portions were so small, I was still hungry at the end. Their bok choy was seriously a joke. It was just tossed in some sauce, that's it. Their chicken skewers were too dry and their quesadillas tasted worse then TGIF. \n\nWaiters: The guys who waited our table was nice. We had two friends that came super late and we were already done with our food. They were nice enough to take orders for extra food for them. The \"ladies\" on the other hand seemed extremely busy. Every time we tried to order something, we had to wave them down and they seemed impatient while we tried to figure out what we wanted. \n\nPerformers: These \"ladies\" put us women to SHAME. Seriously some of them are hot! I couldn't help but to stare, like how'd they get their legs so tone? Their bodies are rockin'! And they got the whole \"girl moves\" down.  I was seriously impressed at how they waltzed from one end of the platform to the next, in their 4in heels without falling. Much props! And their makeup -- I feel like I need a lesson from them.\n\nI always have an interesting experience here, but I wouldn't come here for just any ordinary night. \n\nOh and also regarding the special Yelp check in offer where you get a shot -- we checked in and showed one of the ladies our phone and she went to get us the shots only to never come back.

(truthfully I was more excited about my glass than the food, sadly).\nThe food came out quick, thankfully because I was fairly hungry but sadly the dishes didn't satisfy. We had seared ahi tuna, chicken satay sticks, potato stars for apps. Main courses included Lamb, filet Mignon, salmon and crab cakes. Desserts included mini ice cream cones, fried banana's and mini warm chocolate cakes with raspberries. (Don't get me wrong the food was OKAY... but definitely not the best I've had).\nThe four stars all go directly to the staff at AsiaSF. Everyone was amazing! They were funny and entertaining, yet constantly coming around to ask us if we were doing okay. The show was entertaining, drinks were good.. overall had a fun time. It was definitely an experience.", "author": "Tiff C."}

I find it natural to call them \"girls\" because their Ta-Ta's are as big as mine, if not BIGGER!   And they can certainly rock their sexy outfits way better than half of the female population out there.   Especially Aliyah...she was our favorite!\n\nWe celebrated my cousin's Bachelorette here last weekend and had an awesome time!  The host was very considerate in seating our group with a great view of the bar/stage where the girls performed.  And the shows were very entertaining as the girls were strutting on stage in skimpy outfits and lip singing!  Their bodies are to die for!  The crowds were clapping, hollering and screaming in delight!  I was trying to see if the guys at the table next to us were turned on or not.  Haha.\n\nAll the girls were very friendly and they took turns bringing out our dinner.  We had ordered the gold package dinner which included:\nChicken satays, porcupines, duck quesadilla, & ahi burgers, steak salad, spicy lamb, truffled soba noodles, baby back ribs, and ice cream dessert!  Wow- that was alot of food and it was all pretty good!\n\nOur waitress Aliyah was even nice enough to let the Bachelorette take a blow job shot in between her legs!  Caught on camera-Priceless!  \n\nOur party had an amazing time here!  It was definately pricey when all the drinks, tax and tip were tallied up.

This is the kind of place you want to go on a Birthday or Bachelorette/Bachelor party and try not to be too picky about money. \n\nOther than that, It is SOOOOO much fun. We had a table with not the best view but we had our own little area which was nice. We went with 9 people. I think the plates of food they bring out have 4 servings on them so we ended up with food for 12 people. We couldn't even finish it all. Some dishes were significantly better than others but overall pretty good. We went downstairs and danced after dinner which was also a lot of fun. It wasn't super crowded but that was nice because we were there for a birthday party with all girls and just wanted to dance. I would definitely go back for someone else's bday or bachelorette.", "author": "Alyssa B."}

Surprisingly, they were okay with it and said that as long as I came in before 8, I wouldn't miss the show and would be fed. Awesomeness #1. \n\nUpon arriving, I was able to take pictures with my coworkers in front of their AsiaSF display backdrop. As we walked in, we were greeted by friendly (and gorgeous) workers. We got a table quickly, though it was cramped (as I would think most all the tables were). Oh well, doesn't matter cause the view of the center where the performers will be was nice. Awesomeness #2. \n\nRight as we were seated, Tita, our server, introduces herself and gives us the run-down of how AsiaSF worked. Alright, alright! So we're all excited since we've planned to come here since November. Ordered ahi burger as my appetizer and crab cakes for my entree. I had a really strong drink called something something Pussycat, too. Awesomeness #3. \n\nAs our food arrives, the show begins. Each dancer was great and never failed to entertain! On a side note, while watching the entertainment, one of the servers came by and gave the table an appetizer on the house because one of the dishes I ordered was going to take a little longer than planned (it wasn't that long, but what awesome service!) All the food was delicious and I didn't realize the combination of each small dish would fill me up. Awesomeness #4. \n\nDuring the intermission, Tita pulled me out of my chair and I received (or gave?) a complimentary BJ shot. LOL @ what ensued during this. Awesomeness #5. \n\nThe rest of the show was intense and the entire restaurant was loudly cheering and whooping and clapping for each dancer. I thought Tita's was the best because it was the most entertaining. I need to put that Wonder Woman theme song in my iPod. During this time, we were served dessert and I decided to change my dessert drink to the trio of ice cream cones. There was no trouble at all with the change and I absolutely loved the ice cream. At the end of the show, everyone was given time to pay and everything was done in a timely fashion. Awesomeness #6.\n\nAs we exit, we were able to take pictures with most of the performers and even the hostess (because she was freakin' fierce!). All were nice and friendly and happy to take pictures with us. Awesomeness #7. \n\nIn the end, I would for sure come back to AsiaSF! It's one of those \"gotta experience\" things that you check off your bucket list. A+ Super glad I chose to go here for my birthday.", "author": "Leslie Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-27", "description": "Came here yesterday with yelper Gloria C. and 3 others for a night out on the town for the menage-trois menu. Two years ago, I had been here with yelper Sigourney W. for our friend Anna's goodbye party, and both experiences were about the same.  Food tasted the same, dancers were the same, service was the same, and restaurant's clientele was the same.  Food was still pricey, however the menu prices didn't change since the last time I was here.\n\nIf you come here on a Friday -or- Saturday, you *must* get the menage-trois menu if you are a party of less than 5.  On all other days, you can order a la carte, which kind of sucked because one of my friends wanted to order a la carte, but he couldn't.  \n\nTwo years ago when I came here,  I came with a party of 20, and I didn't think there was enough food for all of us.  We ordered the platinum menu along with a whole lot of drinks, and boy did we have a good time!  Not only that, but Margaret Cho made a special visit that day, so that topped the night off.  Since the platinum menu is a sampling menu, we got to try a little bit of each of the appetizers and main courses.  As a guy, I didn't think it was enough and I was left a little hungry.\n\nSpeed forward 2 years later, having the menage-trois menu, we each got a full appetizer, entree, and dessert, which was fairly filling.  Total for the menage-trois menu is $39+tax/tip. For a group of 5, they tack on a 20% service charge and 4% healthy SF tax, so totalling $55.  It was quite an expensive night, but hey--part of the total is paying for the dance show that is included *and* the access to the club/lounge down stairs.  I had ordered the ahi tuna sashimi appetizer (spicy and creamy), the filet mignon (comes with eggplant which compliments well-if you like eggplant), and the fried banana dessert (with vanilla ice cream, yummy!)--all of which were fairly standard at any Asian Fusion restaurant and nothing that screamed *wow* or *special*.  Despite the 2 year gap that spanned this current visit and my last visit 2 years ago, the food quality remained the same--fairly average, nothing special, but definitely tasty if you're on a HUNGRY stomach...which I definitely was.\n\nNow, on to the show--the show was definitely a treat.  When do you get to see gender illusionists dance in front of you?  Once in a blue moon.  From what I remembered from my last visit 2 years ago, the dance show pretty much hadn't changed, with the exception of the music choice (after all, you have to reflect dance routines with contemporary music!).  My lady friends (especially Gloria C.) enjoyed the show wholeheartedly and commented on how awesome the show was, but my guy friend was a little uncomfortable, and spoiled the mood of the show.  \n\nI enjoyed my experiences both times I came here, but as yelper Angie K. says, your experience is dependent on who you go with and where you are seated.  When I came here 2 years ago, I came with a really large group and we all had a great time.  We also ordered a lot of alcohol, so it made the night even more memorable and fun.  This latest experience was still fun, but we didn't order any alcohol (besides the free complimentary shot when you check in on Yelp), so none of us were tipsy (and therefore, willing to \"let loose\").  As I had stated before, the mood was a little spoiled with my guy friend who looked constipated and uncomfortable.\n\nSo, as a recommendation, you should come here with friends who are willing to spend at least $50 on dinner (as students, this may be hard) and who are willing to have *fun* and *open* to new things (not everyone can be comfortable with the concept of Asia SF).  Usually...larger groups work better as it enhances the \"fun\" environment here at AsiaSF.  Anyway, if you follow these 2 recommendations, you will be bound to have a great and enjoyable time!", "author": "Matthew L."}

Food is very pricey, service is mediocre and there is a good chance you will be seated at a table so small you will wonder if it was made for dwarves.  I was seated next to a table of women in the 40s who poured iced water down each other's shirts while taking shot after shot. Gotta give them props.\n\nIf you come on a Friday, you must order the prefix meal for $39 (first course, main course and dessert).  After the gratuity and all that was included, I ended up paying $55.  I had the mussels, \"baby got back\" ribs and the chocolate cake.  Mussels are salty, ribs were edible and chocolate cake was good but not great.\n\nYou may be sitting there wondering why I am still giving it 4 stars!  Am I bipolar?  No!\n\nIt's because I really had a great time!\n\nI couldn't stop checking out the hot ladies.  One of the ladies had thighs, hips and ass like Beyonce.  Another did splits on the bar and then sassed up some guy who was texting on his phone and made him retrieve his Blackberry from between her legs.  His boyfriend cheered him on. A.W.E.S.O.M.E. \n\nGo with the right mindset and you'll have a great time. :)", "author": "Gloria C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-24", "description": "A required San Francisco experience for anyone who isn't afraid to step out of their comfort zone and embrace the wonderful LGBT community in this city.\n\nI organized a dinner here for a friend who was visiting from out of town. Reservations were made 2 weeks in advance for her, me and two other friends of mine on a Friday night. Definitely plan ahead and make reservations at least a couple of weeks beforehand because this place is popular! For a dinner + show combo, expect to pay about $60+ with tax and tip included. Additional drinks are around $12. The dinner portion will include 3 courses per person (you can choose from anything on the menu) and the show is spaced out throughout the meal so that you have plenty of time in between segments to eat.\n\nVIBE/AMBIENCE: Classier than I presumed, with strategically placed lighting, modern hues and plush seating. Music is on the louder side but not any worse than at a typical bar. There is a red carpet and a screen backdrop outside the restaurant where you can have your photo professionally taken for free, adding to the aura of glamor.\n\nDRESS CODE: Do come dressed fashionably. I don't think they'll turn you away if you show up in jeans, but you'll probably be the only one there wearing denim. Most of the customers I saw were in cocktail-wear: knee-length dresses, dress slacks, heels and lots of pretty, shiny jewelry.\n\nDRINKS: I got the Trina's Pussycat (hey, when in Rome....) and it was very fruity and sweet, not strong, served in a big martini glass. One friend got the Lychee Blue Cura\u00e7ao, and it was the same fruity, sweet, not-strong caliber. Check in on Yelp and you can get a free shot (one per person per check-in). Three of us did that (the fourth girl couldn't download the Yelp app), so we did shots halfway through our dinner. They were very sweet and diluted. I imagine you'd have to down at least 10 just to get a buzz. Now, if you decide to pay for shots, you will have a far different experience from the free ones. Men must drink their shots from the cleavage of the waitress. The glass is wedged into the cleavage and the man must get it using only his mouth, though he is encouraged to hold onto the waitress's breasts for balance. Women must drink their shots from the waitress's crotch. The waitress sits down, puts the shot glass between her legs and the woman must get down on her knees and use only her mouth to pick up the glass. All this to say, order shots at your own risk!\n\nFOOD: The diplomatic way to say this would be that people do not come here for the culinary experience. Seriously, my out-of-town friend is an avid food blogger who photographs every morsel of food she ever comes near. She's the girl annoying everyone with her camera's flash at a fancy restaurant, that's how devoted she is. Well, she didn't even bother photographing her food at AsiaSF. It's not that anything was inedible, but it just wasn't very good (even though the presentations were rather pretty). I had the grilled shrimp and herb salad. The shrimp was already cold and the herbs were overwhelming (I don't think it's ever a good idea to pair cilantro and scallions--two very pungent herbs--in the same dish). The truffled soba noodles had absolutely no truffle flavor whatsoever and were smothered in a thick, creamy, peanut-like sauce that I couldn't take more than two bites of. I ended up swapping it for my friend's fish and forbidden rice, which was much better. The dessert was probably the best. We shared the black rice pudding with mango and the banana sundae. I'd definitely recommend the rice pudding.\n\nSERVICE: Lovely! Every staff person was warm, friendly and outgoing.\n\nTHE SHOW: Entertaining to watch, but I was disappointed that it wasn't more....daring. I've been to my fair share of drag queen/transgendered shows and they're always fun. The most shocking was probably a show I watched in Provincetown, Cape Cod, MA. Not only were the drag queens amazing dancers in amazing costumes moving to amazing music, but there was one particular performer who was called \"The Question\" or something like that who appeared naked expect for some strategically placed pasties. The idea was that no one could tell if she was actually a woman or just a very, uh, flexible man. Given AsiaSF's reputation (and SF's reputation in general), I was kind of expecting that same level of envelope-pushing. But the show was definitely on the safe size, with almost no strip-tease, outfits that covered everything and average dance moves. I guess I expected the performers to do more than just strut around lip-syncing to pop songs.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely a place to have a good time. Let loose, go wild, down a shot from someone's crotch! After all, this is San Francisco!", "author": "Josephine L."}

I've been here twice and my experiences just keep getting better!! \n\nThe first time I came to see the show I was sitting at a side booth not in front of the bar which keeps you a safe distance away from all the action going on at the seats at the bar which also doubles as the catwalk/ dance stage for all the performers. But don't think you've escaped so easily from the performers because they come around constantly checking up on you and if you really catch their eyes they'll insist you do a blow job shot between their thighs! \n\nSome of the performers have a thing for men in uniform and my best friend's boyfriend came with us and he is in the military...boy did he find himself in a corner that night. I think he was corned into two blow job shots that night; good thing he didn't actually wear his uniform to dinner I'm sure he would have been pulled to the stage haha. \n\nThe second night I came I sat in the hottest seat at the bar because it is the closest seat to performers' dance stage. Honestly, the most embarrassing spot to be in because if you're not prepared to participate in the in show then you better trade seats. I had to squeeze boobies from one performer and then somehow I found my head under the dress of another performer while everyone still having dinner were cheering and probably taking photos of all the surprised action taking place.  \n\nAlthough I was probably very flush in the face afterwards, being apart of their acts made the night hilarious, fun and more enjoyable for the group I came with. \n\nI'd definitely recommend for a eventfully night to remember.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

Oh boy~ that was one of the kind dinner in the city. \n\nSo what's this place about? Unlike usual restaurant, you are not gonna have a quiet ambience for dinner.  Having dinner at Asiasf is more like having dinner in a lounge which has mini shows go along with it, therefore, of course, there gonna be also talking, laughing and cheering. Most importantly, all the beautiful waitresses, which are also the dancers of Asiasf, are transgender. The ladies take turns to dance on the bar to the pop songs and lip-syncing along. I won't say there's much of the depth of the performance, but at some point the show can be hilarious and flirting. \n\nAbout the food, honestly, I'm not a fan of it. We had a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night at 7:15. So the rule was we each have to at least order their 3 course pre-fixed Platinum menu. And the food was served family style. On Fridays and Saturdays, it's 50 bucks each. I have to say the food was just an average, compare to that price (of course you have to take that show into account). And the amount was kind small too. Some of my male friends wanted something else to eat after the meal. My favorite items of the courses were the lamb dish and their cute ice creams with cones.  Plus a drink, all include, it's about 80 bucks per person. \n\nSo, was it nice that I paid a visit? Definitely! But will I come back again? Umm... maybe not... or only if I have something to celebrate. \n\nImportant TIP!! Check-in on Yelp on your mobile, you might get free shots like we did =D", "author": "Serena H."}

I made reservations for six people, one week in advance, but when we got there they were not able to seat us all together. In turn, a couple of my friends had to sit away from us. That was a bummer. The restaurant is small and a little cramped so we weren't able to squeeze in a few extra chairs to make them fit. But really, we shouldn't have had to worry about that at all with reservations in advance.\n\nAs I said, the dining area is a little cramped. There is space to sit comfortably but the tables are super close. So I was pretty much almost sitting with the party next to us. So you gotta be comfortable with being closer to other diners than normal.\n\nThe show was awesome! All the girls did great, all very entertaining! The first girl came out to a Gwen Stefani mix (who I am a HUGE fan of) and I swear - best day ever! The girls are also very interactive with the crowd during the shows and that is always a plus.\n\nSince the show is the main attraction here, I was expecting the food to be mediocre but I was so wrong. The food was delicious and everyone really enjoyed it.  We also had a couple drinks which were also made well.\n\nAfter dinner we went down to the basement to their bar/club for some dancing.

When you walk in, you are greeted by a photographer and the loveliest ladies. Trina was our hostess, and she was superb! I was the first one there, she made sure I had a drink and introduce me to the menu while I waited for the birthday girl and the rest of my party. As soon as my friends came our food was quickly served. I have to admit that the food wasn't that great, but the girls dancing on tables and the music made everything taste better.

The vibe is just fun fun fun! \n\nWhen we were sat, our hostess, Tita greeted us and chatted and we told her that we checked in at Yelp and got free shots! =) yes there was even a Yelp deal there! I was so excited My very first time using a Yelp check in offer! \n\nThe food was yummy especially since most people don't come for the food. They usually come for the show the the gorgeous ladies, at least I do! \n\nAll I have to say is if you're looking for a good time in SF, you have to check this place out.

Food was nothing to rave about, the show was good, but the club downstairs only played hip-hop. The drag queens were a blast to talk to. However, the clubs like this in Louisville make this one look bad- the transgendered queens put on better shows, and the dance clubs play better club dance music. Plus, the prices here are overpriced. Drinks are a reasonable price, but that's it. We had fun, but it could've been a lot better!", "author": "Pamela F."}

I'm sure you all have figured out by now that the girls here are not your average everyday type girls. These girls give me a run for my money. ;) Everyone there is friendly and more than accommodating. \n\nMake reservations. My preference is Thur - Sat nights for dinner. The vibe is a lot different when you are there with a full restaurant of people. \n\nMost of the food I've had there tastes great. My MUST is always the lemongrass sake mussels. Yum. \n\nYou will spend quite a bit if you are drinking as well, as their drinks run about $10 a drink. \n\nDownstairs there is a bar/small dance floor if you need to kill some time before heading to the next spot.

In addition to the many drinks we had throughout the night, I had the chicken satay, baby back ribs, and mini ice cream cones. The food came in perfect servings and I thought it was pretty good. The ice cream cones I would consider regular, so either prepare yourself to eat a lot or share with your party. We also split a couple of appetizers as well. The show was fun, I think there were a total of 6 dances, though it definitely could have gone longer.

I got mini mahi burgers and they were AMAZING! It took me so long to decide what I wanted and luckily most people got different things and I got to taste the amazingness. \nThe drinks were also really yummy and had fun, naughty names. Definitely choose your drink by name, not by what's in it, because it makes it more fun and exciting!\n\nIf you are going in a big group I suggest you do the a la carte menu (that is what we did) because that way everyone can choose and pay for what they want. Each meal was plenty of food so you don't really need to get 3-4 courses -- but hey, it's a night out, why not!\nThere were 2 rounds of performers.

Due to the size of our group, we got the gold menu.  Overall, it's okay to eat if you're hungry, but I probably would've rather eaten elsewhere and come here afterwards since the food was just disappointing, especially for all the great food you can get elsewhere in SF.  I'd give 2 stars for the food.\n\nThe show is what you really come here for, though.  The performers were very charismatic, confident, flirty, and fun to watch.  Some of the guys in our group went in to get body shots; the fun shot is the \"blowjob\" shot. ;) 4.5 stars for the show!\n\nProtip: I think view-wise, we probably got one of the better seats of the house which was near the bar, by the entrance.

Maybe it's not for everyone, judging from the reviews, but I had a blast!  It's a small venue, with a \"stage\" up behind the bar where the performers strut their stuff and lip synch.  We saw four performers on this particular Wednesday evening, and each performance was pretty awesome!  The gimmick is that these \"sisters\" used to be \"brothers,\" but who cares?  It's a show featuring gorgeous ladies with amazing bodies, killer moves, and great stage presence.  \n\nThe \"menage a trois\" dinner menu was quite good - each course was generous and well-seasoned.  Service was a bit slow because we ate our courses between the acts of the show.   The porcupines were tasty, as was the seared tuna appetizer.  The orange lamb was good (but I especially liked the rice that it came with) and the crabcakes were small but flavorful.  Dessert was probably my favorite course, even though I was pretty full - the candied ginger rice pudding and pineapple cheesecake were both unique and delicious.  I really wanted to finish them but couldn't quite eat that much.  Having read the reviews, I wish I'd tried the ice cream cones!\n\nThe mixed drink menu is extensive, with some traditional drinks and a few original takes.  Each drink is named after one of the performers.  The drinks were rather mild but tasty... and as the emcee said, \"The more you drink, the prettier we look!\"\n\nGreat atmosphere, they took time to find out where the audience was from and highlighted special occasions that various folks were celebrating.  Some of the performers were also serving various tables, and they wandered from table to table between acts.  Very personable!  The only negative I've got about the evening is the uncomfortable stools - I wish they had more comfortable seating when you're going to be sitting around for a couple of hours!", "author": "Sara M."}

Our group was split into two tables. The other side received their appetizers way before our side. By the time we got our appetizers, they were already working on their main dishes.\n\nFor $45/person and a large group, you would think that a restaurant would be able to serve up enough food with a pre-fixe menu. The portions were TINY and very SALTY. Not impressed at all. I honestly think that the ice cream dessert was the best from the whole pre-fixe.

I came here for a birthday and not only was I present for the birthday girl's BJ shot that took place in between our hostess' mammary glands, but I was there to witness a man by the bar get his head placed in performers' pelvic area multiple times throughout the night. He was such a good sport. For the most part, I can't  say there is much depth to the performances. It's mostly pretty women dancing around on the bar to the latest pop songs and maybe lip-syncing along, but they do so with some serious confidence. The fun definitely comes with the crowd of people you go with. Overall, I liked the energy and diversity of the crowd.  \n\nFood is prefixed and served tapas/family style. My favorites were the tuna sashimi, baby bak choy and shiitakes, miso glazed salmon, coconut jasmine rice from the orange lamb dish, and their icecream cones. YUM. I didn't care for their shrimp herb salad; there was a bit too much cilantro in it. And I thought they went a little overboard on the truffle oil with their truffled soba noodles. Cocktails are not included with the meal, but portions are generous to the point of being filling. I recommend Amber's Sex Kitten, and Aliyah's Lychee Breeze.\n\nThe dance floor downstairs is small and poorly ventilated (even when it's empty). You really have to take a breather every 30mins. if you don't want to pass out or get claustrophobic. Bathroom lines can also get a bit long. And beware the bill racks up pretty easily.  It's fifty per attendee, but after a drink or two, plus tip, tax, and one of SF's special taxes, it can easily jump to 100+ per person.", "author": "Alesia T."}

We checked in then headed downstairs to grab a drank and wait for our table. Downstairs is a club/lounge area. Go here on a Sunday or Thursday and it's pretty mellow. Come on saturday and you're in for a real aural treat. If you like people screaming and shrieking all around you then this is your scene. Fortunately the bartenders pour strong drinks and they are pretty attentive. After bemusedly standing around watching a girl strike out trying to hit on my bf we were summoned to our table upstairs. \n\nThe tables line the perimeter around the bar/stage so no matter where you sit you have a decent view of the show. The performers are also the servers, and what's cool is they personalize menus for your event, in this case my friends Bday Extravaganza. At this point I looked around and realized that every table in the restaurant was full of women. Cheerful ladies celebrating the impending nuptial of one of their white-veiled chums. Sixty straight women, five gay guys and a gaggle of female illusionists =an only in SF experience.\n\nThe food: you choose food and it's served tapas style. It comes out like clockwork. The food is good, tasty. Nothing groundbreaking.\nThe dranks: so strong you may want to throw on a wig and join the show (don't--it's not allowed EVER)\nThe service: what's better than having your server take your order for a quadruple vodka tonic then jump on the bar to shimmy and jam to \"Set Fire to the Rain\"? \n\nThe show: what's not to like about  gorgeous women in gorgeous outfits lipsyncing to pop music on a stage in the middle of a bar?\n\nAn added bonus: when you produce four credit cards the lovely ladies don't even flinch.

I really liked the Truffled soba noodles, Orange lamb was good, Ahi tuna burger very yummy but cooked well done. We had a strict vegetarian & the tofu dishes were the best tofu I've ever had. The banana lumpia with caramel & chocolate dipping sauces were ah-mazing!\n\nThe girls were beautiful, friendly & knew how to shake it & get the crowd clapping & singing along.\n\nAfer dinner we went to the club downstairs & closed the place down. Bartenders poured good drink, DJ was iffy at best but what little snippets of songs he played were good danceable songs.", "author": "Kym T."}

The show was entertaining and all the waitresses are really nice and make you feel welcomed and special. We celebrated my friend's bday here and every bday or guest of honor gets their name on the menu and a complimentary BJ shot. \n\nI didnt expect the food to be that great because I figure it's more for the show, but there was some nice surprises. It's a set menu for everyone, with a few appetizers, couple different entrees and mini ice cream cone desserts. I wasn't paying too much attention to the food because that's not really what we came here for, but overall it wasn't bad, some hits and misses but nothing horrible to complain about.", "author": "Diana Y."}

If you want to come in for the shows they are done in 2 hour intervals so all reservations are limited to the 2 hours from which you made your said reservation. \n\nTo the point: I had a f$*k$n great time. We sat at the bar and unbeknownst to us, we got the best seats in the house for the performances. Straight eye view. The girls looked good (all Asian on that day) and everyone was soooooooo nice and up beat. \n\nWe had the menage-au-tois which is a 3 course meal naturally consisting of appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the chicken skewers, filet, and chocolate cake. The portions were surprisingly large and I couldn't eat my entire appetizer and entree. You're out of your mind if you think I didn't completely devour my dessert.\n\nThere is another menu, and don't quote me, but my friend told me that unless you were in a party of 5 or more, you were required to order the menage-a-tois. This is not officially confirmed by me.\n\nAfter your 2 hours are up and you are not quite done with the par-tay, then you can head on downstairs where there is a dance floor and a bar and more of their girls to dance with you. \n\nThis place seems to be THE place for bachelorette and birthday parties. On Saturday, there were at least 3 large bachelorette parties during my time there and I saw a few before finishing up.\n\nService was great and attentive. If nothing else, the final performance was the home run of the night.", "author": "M L."}

They each bring their own unique style to the show.\n\nDon't head downstairs for drinks after. It's better to go somewhere else in soma for that.  Don't get me wrong, they are delicious but at a premium for what you get.\n\nOverall, the experience was a lot of fun.

When we got there they let you hang out downstairs in their little club/bar area which was a nice way to start the night instead of waiting outside or in a lobby area. The seating was a little tight for a party of 16 but we were able to manage. This would be a great place for a smaller group. It's on the pricey side but you get a really entertaining show and some really great cuisine. I wish that the first act of the show didn't happen while our main courses came out because I was torn between eating or paying my full attention to the dancing ladies. However it was nice for the second act to happen while dessert was served since the dessert didn't need as much attention\n\nThe food was served family style and my stomach was very satisfied without being full.  We were all able to try a little bit of everything. My favorite dish was the salmon on black rice with cherry tomatoes and edemame. It was just a really nice and well rounded dish full of flavor. I could go into the whole menu, but in general it was all really satisfying. The amazing food with the fabulous show made every penny worth it for a great night with friends.

People at my table got served their meals at different times.  And don't make any changes to your entree - they won't change what they are serving.\n\nDo not expect to sit in their theatre without sitting right on top of the next table.  Three of us got squeezed into a small bar top that probably should have seated two people.  I got to know my neighbors because we would bump each other often. \n\nThe food experience alone is the main reason I will never go back again.

I have taken a date, my mom, and my cousins all on separate occasions and they all had a blast. It is a unique experience even conservative people enjoyed at least from my experiences.\n\nThe setup could be a little better especially if your group is off to the side, you may get a pole obstructing your view a little. If you are straight on or behind, you have a good seat.\n\nThe food is solid. They have a fixed price and you have a few choices from each category of appetizers, entree, and desert. For $35, you cannot go wrong. Their cocktails are done well, have a good kick, and well presented.\n\nThe main staple of this place is the show. The girls who perform are entertaining and funny. They also double as your server. *Tip* If you sit at the end of the bar they put the person's face to their chest. *Tip*\n\nFantastic dinner and show. Kudos to the owner great guy who cares about his patrons.", "author": "Richard K."}

I requested the Diamond Package. $69 per person. However, you need to include 20% mandatory tip and Tax on top of that. If you do the math $69 turns into $93 per person. That is not including drinks. The food was amazing. The manager was very accommodating as well. I am allergic to sea food.  I requested that all sea food be substituted. The manager without giving me $hit. He made it happen. The desserts were my favorite. The drinks were well made. The shows where out of this world. I was highly entertained not to mention very jealous on how beautiful they all looked. When the show was over the ladies showed us love by coming to our table to take pictures with us and even gave me a free shot (body shot). The club downstairs played great music (HIP HOP). It had been a while. must clubs now a days do a mix of hip hop and house music. This was pure Hip hop all night long.. YES!!  Unfortunately the club did die down pretty quickly. By 12 pm the club was half empty. TO me however, was not a bad thing. It felt good to dance without having to worry about someone running into me. Felt even better to be able to seat down anytime my feet where hurting. (There was no reserved seating.) Ultimately, I had a great time. My guest eat until they couldn't eat. Everyone was full. We were all drunk. We had no drama. We danced to great music and friendly staff. OVER ALL 10 Stars!! if I could give it. Just come prepared to spend some money..

First of all, having had overall poor service throughout San Jose & San Francisco, I was pleasantly surprise by ALL of the staff at Asia SF.  The performers/waitresses, managers, hostess, bartenders, food runners, etc were all the most welcoming people I encountered in California, and definitely are near the top of my overall list. \n\nThe food was great.  My group of friends (5 of us) chose the \"M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\" menu option....one first course, one entree, and one dessert or dessert drink each.  Great value, and FANTASTIC quality food.  Service was a bit slow, but they were busy, and the performers were the servers as well.  Food runners were swamped.  Plus, we were kept entertained while waiting.\n\nThe only downside was parking.....the street meters are all hour-limit or less, lot or garage parking is 3-4 blocks away and can range up to $20....we got lucky, the attendant charged us the hourly fee. \n\nWhen we left, all four of the performers working that night posed for a photo with our group.

There were maybe at least 5-6 other bachelorette parties going on, seems like this is the place to be for one.  The drinks were ok (could be a little stronger) but the food was actually really good and exceeded my expectations (which were not much).\n\nWe had the platinum package which was served family style.  Our first course included chicken satays, tuna sashimi, \"asia-dilla\", baby bok choy and shitake mushrooms, and a shrimp/herb salad...everything was pretty good but I probably enjoyed the sashimi and mushroom/bok choy dishes the most.  They had a short show in between the courses, and the \"ladies\" were really entertaining and looked great!\n\nOur main course included \"baby got back\"ribs, orange lamb, sauteed king salmon, and truffled soba noodles.  The soba noodles were very truffle-y and was probably my favorite dishes of the night.  We had a slightly longer show after the main course which included a kim kardashian lookalike...and ended with the bridal \"like a virgin\" routine.  Then they had our bride do a \"blowjob\" shot from one of the drag queen's crotch while holding on to her fake boobs which was pretty awesome.  \n\nDessert were ice cream cones and warm banana beignets...I liked the ice cream but didn't get to try the beignets since I was already full.  The service in general was very efficient and well-timed and we had more than enough food.  It's a bit on the expensive side (we wound up spending $100/pp including tax, tip, and drinks), but we all had a blast.

The entertainers also serve as servers of food and they all seem miserable and tired.  We had two servers/hostesses and they were both pretty indifferent and were as enthusiastic as DMV employees.  They probably should just allow them to dance and entertain and have other people serve the food and take orders so they wouldn't seem so overworked and under-enthusiastic.  You kind of feel sorry for the staff.  There was very little joy in the place despite the fact that you expect a party atmosphere.  It was all very compulsory and high-speed.  Nothing natural or fun for anybody but the drunk women (this is mainly for women by the way) having their bachlorette parties who get their \"selfie\" opportunities with the disconnected staff.  Like a depressing cruise ship. \n\nThe food is pretty plentiful but it tastes like something you would get at Six Flags or Chuck E. Cheese as in there's no ostensible attempt to serve tasty food since very few people are coming there for the food and very few people are ever going to come back since it's more of a novelty place so they don't need to generate repeat business I suppose.  The drinks are slow to come out and unspectacular.  Get really drunk ahead of time, expect very little in the way of enthusiastic and fun entertainers (although they shake it pretty well on the stage) and you'll at least be able to say you went there once.  Oh, and bring your dad's credit card becuase it's quite expensive.

Excellent entertainment :-)  The food was ok, but we didn't go to AsiaSF for the food, who are you kidding?!  Drinks were delicious.  We went on a saturday night & there were 7 bachelorette parties for the 9pm show. The host got on the bar with the microphone & individually announced the brides with their entourage.  Our menu also had some personalization for our girlfriend.  After the bar show, the ladies came around and made sure each bride had a celebratory sexually-oriented shot - which was fabulous for the great pictures & the laughs!!!  Afterward we decided to check out the music downstairs - with no intention of staying, but we ended up staying because the DJ was great & so was the atmosphere.\n\nAs a side note, if you are going there with a bigger group of girls, you can get a free round of shots for your group if you leave a bra for them to hang up above the bar downstairs.  Nobody did it while we were there.  Definitely recommend AsiaSF for a night of great laughs & very unique entertainment.  The gold party package + round of shots + 6 drinks was $100/person.

I mean seriously where else are you going to find a place where you eat pretty good food while being entertained by beautiful trannies?  They are just fabulous.  Its hard to not stare and be like.. no it can't be.. is it? maybe?  how..? \n\nOf course I had heard so much about this place and so many other people have but have not gone.  Seriously if you have not come you need to.  Its perfect for a night out with girls catching up, bachelorette parties, or in my case my 25th Bday party dinner. \n\nThis place is much smaller than you think it is and its basically two floors.  Downstairs is the bar/club area where you can stay while waiting for your table or for after your dinner.  They have a bar down there with a bunch of bras hanging. haha.  So people leave this place bra-less? Interesting. \n\nSo to make sure the place wasn't booked and I got the ideal time of 7:30pm I called in 3 months ahead of time.  They are super great with reservations and completely understanding that with big parties it fluctuates.  I literally changed my reservation from 15 to 19 to 17 etc about 5 times and worked with Kim.  She was super nice about it.  I ended up with 17 people at my party. \n\nMy only qualm.. and me as in my friends is that its a bit pricey.  I totally think its worth it and know that its a once in a lifetime thing.  You wouldn't come to this type of thing all the time so thats why I wasn't bothered by it. \n\nSo its a pre-fix menu and you literally get everything on the menu.  I got a personalized menu too which was cute!  Will def keep for scrapbook purposes. haha. \n\nThey organized the dinner so well.. they bring the appetizers and everyone at the tables shares everything and their is def plenty of food.  Plenty of leftovers that we didn't bother taking home. \n\nSo the appetizers came first.. when we finished their was a performance of the \"girls\" lip synching with their hot bodes in scantliy clad clothes on the bar and then after then we got our entreees and got another performance by 4 \"girls.\" \n\nSo the food breakdown:  We had to get the Platinum menu because we were going on a Saturday evening so it was 48 bucks per person but plus tax 9.5% in SF and gratuity which is 20% its about 63ish bucks per person so I said 65 bucks. This is without drinks of course.  The drinks are yummy and they are about 10 bucks unless its wine so its like 8 or 9 bucks. \n\nPlatinum Feast:  \n- Tuna Sashimi (nice and fresh) \n- Asia Dilla- (very yummy and cheesy) \n- Chicken Satays (these were really DRY so maybe I had to douse it in sauce)\n- Baby Bok shoy and shitakes (great veggies for people that like it like me) \n- Grilled shrimp and herb salad (very seafoody- yum) \n\nEntree:\n- Orange lamb or tofu if you are vegetarian (got the lamb and it was tasty) \n- King Salmon (this was really good on a bed of black rice or something) \n- Soba Noodles (this was cold and grey and kinda odd- too soury for me) \n- Ribs (yum! fell of the bone so tender) \n\nDessert:\n- miniature ice cream cone that they put candles on for me to blow out!\n- Banana Beignet with chocolate and butterscotch sauce (SOO delicious- if I wasn't so full I'd eat more) \n\nBonus I got a blow job shot in between the legs of the \"women\" lol kinda freaky. \n\nAnyways I had a wonderful time.  They say they limit your time to 2 hours but with our large party we were in and out at 1.5 hours.  It was great dinner place before our night of clubbing in SF!", "author": "Anya R."}

Came here with a few other chicks for a bachelorette party. This venue caters a lot to bachelorette parties, birthday parties, and the like; they really give you special attention: shout-outs, and multiple opportunities to do bj shots with the stars of their show. Not for the timid. During the show, the ladies will even give special attention to people who request it (ie. shout the loudest). The dancing is fun to watch, the songs are pop top 40s and it was fun singing along with them!\n\nThe food is fantastic, sort of an Asian fusion, and you get a lot of it. They are also very accommodating to vegetarians. Several of their dishes can be done veggie-style: Asia-dillas, salad with tofu instead of steak, orange tofu, and truffled soba noodles. They are all flawlessly delicious, and to be honest, I wasn't even able to eat very much of all of them, I was so stuffed. I didn't even have room for the ice cream carousel. The drinks, however, are very expensive, and honestly I'm not sure they did much for me. I have to say, the meal is prix-fixe, and it can be expensive if you've made a reservation, and then didn't come with the right  number of people :(\n\nThe club downstairs is kind of small, but fitting.

Your main stars? Gender illusionists.\n\nGlamorous performers, cabaret-style performances, and Cal-Asian cuisine.This highly talked about venue markets itself as a \"one-of-a-kind experience that's a feast for all your senses.\"\n\nThough the novelty aspect gave the night a bit of a spark, there are parts of the experience that didn't fulfill the hype.\n\nFor reservations of two, we were informed we'd be treated to VIP seating of sorts - front row seating, with the ideal \"close-up\" view of the night's stars. We didn't realize it also included cramping our style with cramped seating - imagine yourself feeling like suitcases in the overhead compartment on an overbooked flight. Not so VIP, first-class-esque.\n\nPerhaps our obvious discomfort was noticeable. The waiter later moved us to a slightly more spacious area at the other end of the bar. Small win.\n\nWe were both in the mood for some ahi tuna to kick-start our $45 three-course meal - but unfortunately, they were out. Shelling out $45 for a meal though, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect the full menu to be available. Lesson learned - if you're a tuna fan, you might have better luck with the pre-9:30 pm showing.\n\nWe settled with the chicken satay and fried shrimp/scallop combo to start - and, luckily, it wasn't a bad alternative.\n\nPrior to our main entrees - the filet mignon and salmon, which were middle-of-the road quality - we were welcomed to the real deal, the Asia SF performances.\n\nRocking to the likes of Madonna, Beyonce, and Rihanna - these girls (err..guys?) got it goin' on. A+ moves.\n\nPost-entree, and pre-dessert (chocolate lava cake and banana beignet), we were wow'ed with six more glamorous performances, including a grand finale of the superman show.\n\nThe experience was entertaining, and the downstairs lounge (free cover if you've already snagged a ticket for the main show - $10 otherwise), provides you another avenue for lengthening your magical experience.\n\nAll in all: \n\n-Food - average\n-Performances - entertaining\n-Service - inconsistent\n-Prices - if my wallet could speak to me, it wouldn't be too happy\n-Free signature shots courtesy of a yelp check-in - fabulous\n\nFor a one-time enchantment, not a bad idea.", "author": "Jamie L."}

People who come here are there for that.\n\nBut I know my boyfriend and had read the Yelp! reviews (thanks, Yelpers, I depend on you guys), so I knew it would be some fun...I mean, really, the ladies there are full-blown women, and they are beautiful, talented, and put on a great show.

I came in not expecting much from the food based on the reviews, but I felt like for what we paid (we did use a Groupon since I really had to budget out my 10-day San Francisco visit/trip, and I'm just cheap like that anyway, lol), the food was really good!  We all got different appetizers and shared them and they were all very yum, except for maybe my sister's man's sashimi, which wasn't that great.  For the main course, everyone got the filet mignon except for my boyfriend, who got the scallops.  Everyone agreed it was really good steak and cooked like they had asked.  My boyfriend said his scallops were good.  The only disppointment was maybe the dessert- my sister and I got the Thai black rice pudding, and we both thought it sounded better than it was.  My boyfriend got the chocolate cake with ice cream for his b-day and it was decent, but not really molten- hot and soft inside, but more like chewy, so not how we would prefer it.  My sister's man chose to get a dessert liquer instead of a dessert, and he had no complaints on that.\n\nWe ran up a bill on drinks.  When it's time to celebrate, it's time to celebrate!  Luckily, my sister and her man were paying, ha ha.  Trina's Pussycat drink was great.  No watering down over here!

We came here because we heard about how hot the ladies are and that they dance on top of the bar. So I made reservations for the three of us, and we were seated at the bar. Which was great because we got front row seats and the bartenders were very nice and great to talk to, especially Bruce (he was a great bartender because he I told him I was allergic to alcohol and he remembered even at the end of the night, so he made my complimentary shot with very very very little alcohol)\n\nThe ladies here were amazing... we were memorized by how pretty they all were.... we really wanted to ask them their makeup and hair technique, but it was too loud and I doubt they have time to show us. \n\nThe bartenders helped us take pictures with them, and when we looked at the pictures we were like \"wow... they are so pretty that they dont need to to be photoshoped.\" (yes, i photoshop pictures to fix little flaws... but since they were so perfect, I only had to photoshop myself and my girlfriends) \n\nNow to the food. \nThe food here was ok... my girlfriends and I ordered three different appetizers, they ordered the steak salad and duck quesadilla and I had the chicken satay. I liked the satay chicken because of the sauce that came with it, the chicken itself was a bit dry but it was ok when u cover it with the sauce. The duck quesadilla was pretty good too, it came with this pasty sauce that made it taste even better and less dry. The salad... was not that great... dont recommend getting it.\n\nFor the entree we had the King Salmon and Filet Mignon. The salmon did not have much flavor and I really did not like it much... especially with the small sweet tomatoes... it was just weird... The Filet MIgnon though was really really good. I love the sauce that came with it and the star potatoes. Definitely will get that next time I come here.\n\nFor the dessert my girlfriends had the chocolate cake and the pineapple cheesecake. My friend said the chocolate cake was really dry... so she gave up eating that and just finished the ice cream. And my other friend said that the pineapple cheesecake wasnt that great (dont know why though). I had the banana beignet split and I loved it! especially the banana lumpias, they were so good.... it was kind of like fried banana.\n\nWe had a great time here and got to watch the ladies perform twice and werent being rushed out of the restaurant.

I'm sorry, don't mean to offend any of those who adore this place....  But I stand at 2 stars, and it's tha truth.  With no bias, both Jun and I reviewed this place at the same consensus.  \n\n4 stars on yelp... is this for the show, or for the food?  For the fake tits, perhaps?\n\nThe menu is set and handed out as a reference card for the various dishes, as well as a clever way of displaying the entertainers faces and names linked to specialty house cocktails.  For our group of 20, it cost 60 dollars a head just for the meal.  When you are seated, you are assigned to a particular entertainer who is also your server for the evening.  The entertainers strategically leverage their transexual novelty to solicit drink orders... I definitely felt some judgement passed when I declined on drink orders.  Throughout the night, they must have taken drink orders every 10 minutes... hustling, hustling, hustling those drinks.\n\nThe food arrives in small waves of \"appetizer\", \"entree\", and \"dessert\" between the performances.  The dishes were served in small plates and were distributed between the table.  This proved difficult because the table is tiny, filled with drinks, and there is barely even any elbow room.  If you are seated on the chairs in walk way, good luck even trying to turn your head.  I was dodging a slew of plates, bodies headed to and fro, and drink solicitations all night long.  Not much to say about the food... the Asian fusion dishes did not seem anything extraordinary.  In fact, the only dishes I could say I even enjoyed and ate more of, were the steamed bok choy and mushrooms, and the pork ribs.  Everything else, between the noodles, lamb, chicken skewers, and more was bland or odd tasting.   \n\nThe show garnered the attention of the room when performed--  some of the routines were exciting and fun, while others were sultry.  It generated a mixed response from the audience.  Some drunk people were having the time of their life, while others were staring at their food while trying to look up every once in awhile to be polite.  I thought some dances were well performed while others could not dance or lip sync at all.  It was middle of the ground with a few great performances and other whatevers ones.\n\nAt the end of the night, our bill came out to 2000 at 100 bucks a head.  Dang, those hustled drinks really got us.  Feeling robbed and still hungry, we were skeptical about the invitations to the 'dance club' below the restaurant.  A pleasant smell of sewage wafts up from down there from the bathrooms at the bottom of the stairwell.  The club is reminiscent of a ghetto vampire's den.

We were mistaken and thought that we had to order the menage a trois (3 course meal), so that plus some drinks was almost $100/person.  However, I would suggest ordering a la carte (if you want to try the food, it's nothing special) or just getting drinks (which are kind of expensive).

They have great performances while you eat and they know how to get down. And if you check-in on your yelp app on your phone, you get a free signature shot!! The shots were pretty good, but tasted more like a light cocktail. The cocktails were good and they name each drink after the performers.\n\nThe food was very disappointing. I order the scallops and didn't realize it was in curry satay and the vegetables were not cooked all the way. The servings we extremely small for the price and really not worth it. But I guess the ambiance and performances make up for it (food is not their focus).\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun celebrating my friends birthday and enjoyed talking to the ladies of Asia SF.

It was so much fun and just the right amount of sass and provocativeness to have fun but not be uncomfortable. They work so hard to make you feel welcome and have a great time.

The week of the dinner, they send you a confirmation email, which you click to confirm your reservation.\n\nSo my husband and I finally redeemed the voucher last Sunday night. When my friend told me that there was plenty of parking, I thought that there was a parking garage nearby. Turns out that there was only street parking and since it was a Sunday, we didn't have to worry about the meters.\n\nMy husband and I were escorted by Scarlet (who is the new girl in AsiaSF) and we were seated at the bar. I ordered the grilled shrimp & herb salad, dungeness crab cakes and the banana beignet split. I was amused that the desserts were so Filipino. Even the trio of ice cream with the cone reminded my husband of those back in the Philippines. My husband ordered the mussels, miso glazed king salmon and a creme liqueur drink. Everything was great and we enjoyed every bite.\n\nSeating starts at 7:15pm on a Sunday then you order your food and drinks and have your first course before the first show at 8pm. Then after the show, you have your main course and dessert before the next show at 9pm. In between shows, the girls were giving shots to the birthday people in the room. It was hilarious. The performances were fun to watch, especially when they get someone to participate. I'm actually amazed that the girls could run in heels on that amount of bar space.\n\nThe day that we went, the place was packed. You enter the main room with the bar as soon as you get in. You are basically in close proximity to the person behind you if you're sitting at the bar. The other side of the bar, there's more room. Sitting is already arranged for you depending on how many is in your party.\n\nIf you're sitting at the bar, you would be given a shot and the bartender with drink with you. No worries if you don't drink because the lady next to me doesn't drink so she wasn't given a shot. The bartenders were really nice and so were the girls. The girls were very entertaining.\n\nIn between shows, you can take pictures with the girls and the bartenders if you wish. Our total bill without the voucher was close to $100.

The servers are the beautiful transgender \"ladies of Asia SF\" entertainers who perform atop the bar during the dinner service, dancing, gyrating, and lip-syncing to popular songs.  The cuisine is first rate. The prix fix provides an appetizer, main course, and dessert from a menu with ample delicious choices. We had the seared ahi and the mussels as starters, the scallops and filet mignon as entrees, and the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream and the coconut, mango, pineapple black rice pudding for dessert.  Everything was beautifully presented, perfectly cooked, with robust, aromatic Asian flavors. Vegan and vegetarian menus are also available. Asia SF is a place for celebrations. The night we enjoyed the festivities, there were several birthdays, bachelorette parties, engagements, anniversaries, and visitors from numerous countries all celebrating.  The gorgeous and ebullient hostess, Nya, announced the names of those who are celebrating special occasions right before the show started to a screaming, rambunctious crowd. She has been working at Asia SF for 10 years and loves it, telling us that every day is a party. Corkage is $20 if you bring your own wine, however, their wine list is award winning and they offer excellent specialty drinks named after the \"Asia Girls\" for $12.00.  Prices are per person plus service charge, 4% SF Employer Mandate fee, tax, and tip. . On weekends, the downstairs dance club is also open. Street parking is available. This is an adult venue with ample non-offensive sexual innuendo. Come with an open mind and experience the amusement of people watching paired with inspiring Asian fusion dining.  Make a reservation. Asia SF is an original San Francisco treat.", "author": "Cynthia B."}

It's Lady Gaga's \"Applause\", of course. Because day-uuuuuuum, ya'll deserve a round!\n\nI took four unsuspecting coworkers here on our last night in town, and \"forgot\" to mention the real appeal of ASF. Because where is the fun in spoiling the surprise? In case any of you unsuspecting readers think you're perusing a page for an Asian restaurant with fine-looking servers... well you'd be kinda right. However you'd be missing the entire point of ASF's trademark, their claim-to-fame, their je ne sais quoi, if you will. The servers and DJ are drag queens and/or transgender beauties who perform on the red bar once you've been served. Oh yeahhhhhhhh. \n\nAnd lemme tell ya, these hot bitches can Lay.It.Down. But we'll get to that later. First the boring stuff. Cocktails are named after current and previous talent (order your server's cocktail if you know what's good for you) and the menu is priced for parties. There's a minimum of $25/person and can go up to $65, depending on what menu package you decide on(minimums/prices vary on selection of menu, day, etc) and your party is encouraged to share the apps, entrees and desserts. We did the Gold Package ($35/person) on a rare Monday night show and it was plenty of food for five. And the food is fantastic. We dined on chicken satay, Ahi burgers and the porcupines,  followed by seared tuna, soba noodles, steak, and ribs. The third course gives you the option of a dessert cocktail or a trio of ice cream cones in tropical and coffee flavors. I ordered the least dessert-y cocktail, natch, but someone else got the ice cream and it was to die. \n\nMid-way through your meal, you'll notice your server disappears. That's because he/she is strapping on that glitter bustier and gluing in those extensions so he/she can rock your world on the bar. I've been to my fair share of drag shows, and I can truly say the ladies of ASF can WERK. Light shows, props, water guns, and killer dance moves will keep you entertained until the last beat drops. Four-five queens perform twice, and of course the costume changes are fierce. Sasha would be proud. \n\nAfter the entertainment, the queens give special attention to those celebrating birthdays, bach parties, etc. And even the occasional curious guy who has never experienced a BJ shot drag queen-style.... \n\nASF was one of the highlights of my SF trip and I can't wait to return for a rowdy Saturday evening. I'm bringing a better camera this time, dammit. \n\nGive these queens a round of APPLAUSE.", "author": "Sarah V."}

I've been here twice for birthdays and it's an experience worth having at least once.\n\nThe price isn't cheap, but you do get a lot of food and you're essentially paying for the show.  The drinks are OK, and some of the dishes are good, some bad.  My favorite dish has always been dessert - gotta love coconut and ube ice cream!  Also, they always hook it up with specialty shots for the table and a blowjob shot for the guest of honor (birthday boy/girl, bachelor/ette, etc.)\n\nAs many other reviewers have noted, the performers and waitresses are hot, hot, hot.  The show is definitely entertaining, especially if you've never been to a place like AsiaSF before.  After dinner, they open up a bar / dance floor downstairs.  Though it's nothing like a real club, it's fun if you just want to hang out with your group and continue drinking & dancing later in the night.\n\nOverall, I recommend AsiaSF for a celebratory night out.  Everyone's gotta go at least once!", "author": "Amanda N."}

My girlfriends and I are graduating from college, so we decided to plan a getaway to SF and came here and needless to say, it was TOTALLY APPROPRIATE!\n\n1. Definitely have drinks. Common, you just CANNOT come here sober.\n\n2. Share the bombass food that comes with your friends (there's no point bringing boring friends here, so bring the GOOD FUN ones). We just got it family-style so it saved us the headache of having to choose what we wanted to eat. The lamb with the coconut milk jasmine rice was amazing--usually lamb can be really overbearing, but they made it with this sauce that was really savory. The tuna was yum like everything else.\n\n3. Dance! Dance! Dance! Don't be a downer and stand around waiting for your table. You might as well get your groove on at their underground club\n\n4. Enjoy the shows! I wasn't sure what to expect of these shows, but the servers are AMAZING dancers! (Pussycat Dolls status) and did all these crazy tricks on top of the bar \"run way\"\n\nMoney wise, we each paid $48 each for our meal (including dessert, EXCLUDING drinks.)\n\nDrinks were $10 each. \n\nOH! and we got free drink vouchers from the security guard for being extra rowdy and FUN! Well my roommate threw up (in the trashcan) at the club, and the bartender brought us water and even SAT with her because she looked tired. \n\nWe had a wonderful, personalized experience and were humbled by everyone's awesome service :D I'm excited because we heard that they're opening one up in LA too!", "author": "Tuyen M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-25", "description": "Two of my girlfriends and I had been wanting to go to AsiaSF for the looongest time. Both of their birthdays were this month, so I thought,  \"What better way to celebrate the occasion than a night out at AsiaSF!?\"\n\nThe plan was to have a nice dinner and a few drinks with just the three of us girls; but little did they know, I had a surprise up my sleeves! I planned for their boyfriends and a couple of close friends to surprise them at the dinner table and I am so very happy that it was a success!\n\nI basically made reservations for a party of eight, a month in advanced. It was an easy task using their online reservation system. I was able to choose the menu, time, and day that I wanted with no hassle whatsoever.\n\nThey had three different fixed party menus to choose from--gold, platinum, or diamond. The gold menu, which was $39/person, looked like a pretty hefty meal. I initially reserved for the gold menu, but when I called them two days before the event to confirm, they told me that...with the time slot that I chose, I would only be able to to choose the platinum ($49/person) or diamond ($59/person) menu. I did not understand why and honestly, I was pretty annoyed and hence the one star deduction. I know it's only a $10 difference, but it's really the principle of the matter. If I had not called, would they have informed me the day of the event? Was it some scheme to make more money? Well whatever the case, luckily my friends did not mind. We went with the platinum party menu, which included five first courses, four second courses, and two desserts. I will be blunt and say that the food was not very good. After all, you're really in a lounge/bar type of environment, so you can't expect five star dining. If I had to choose though, the only dishes that I liked were the miso glazed king salmon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=rsuV5sPwoYJ8WBUe5jKgMQ) and the Asia-dilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6LfqlrbkpjZt83bEMZWq7A?select=k-P-9fHxzgYWnOtnLWMx8Q). The salmon was tender and perfectly cooked. The bed of sweet tomato-edamame salad was tangy and delicious! The quesadilla was very cheesy and the sun-dried cherry dip was delicious!\n\nI highly recommend coming to AsiaSF for a fun night out and not for a fulfilling dinner! Our entire party (men included) had a blast! We got to watch two shows and if I remember correctly, there were a total of eight or nine \"ladies\" who performed that night. I was fairly impressed with how they were able to work it in those five inch heels. I will definitely be back!\n\nP.S.\nIf you're coming here on a Saturday--dress to impress, they will be a camera crew snapping pictures throughout the night!", "author": "Lien T."}

I've been here several times and really enjoyed everything about this place each time. I've tried practically every appetizer and main course. Everything is well made and delicious. My favorite is the chicken satay, ribs, and filet. Desserts are a bit on the sweet side, but I have very little tolerance for sugar. It's probably fine for the average people. I took off one star for the lack of consistency in service. I've been here where service was just excellent and flawless, and I've also been here when I was rushed to finish my food and get out of the restaurant, food didn't come for a long time, and food came without any utensil in the middle of the show and was not what I ordered.

I had one of the most fun nights that I've had recently... but with that being said, a lot of the experience is dependent on who you go with and where you are seated.\n\nBecause we were in a party of 3, we were seated at the bar and our sole male companion was seated right next to the dancers' \"stage.\" That made the show just that much more entertaining and fun, because the performers sure had fun giving him their attention during the dance numbers! If you're in a party of 4 or more, you'd be seated at a table and I don't know how much fun that experience would be compared to the experience that I had.\n\nThe food was above average but quite pricey, and I wouldn't go to AsiaSF if it wasn't during Dine About Town. I ordered the ahi tuna for as my appetizer, which was tasty, but I wish they had been sliced a bit thinner. My companions ordered the mussels (HUGE portions as well as delicious!) and the cheese quesidilla, which was average and can be ordered elsewhere.\n\nThe entrees were fantastic. I got the orange lamb, which I was hesitant about but still ordered because of fellow Yelpers' recommendations (thanks!). I was skeptical because a lot of things with 'glaze' tends to have too much sauce... but that wasn't the case for this. It's just too bad there wasn't more! Fellow cucumber haters, beware, because there's a huge cucumber salad that comes with this dish. One of my friends got the filet mignon, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The star shaped tater tots were so cute and an added bonus to the meal (okay, so I'm a sucker for these things).\n\nDessert was great, but I was so full that I couldn't fully enjoy it. Two of us had the chocolate cake, which was good but too heavy. One of my friends had the banana beignet, which I would have rather gotten!\n\nI think what made the night was the entertainment and the service at the bar. Bruce, our bartender, was so attentive and friendly! Our party chatted with him occasionally. All the performers are also very friendly and willing to let you take a blowjob shot (which we bought for our male friend) and plenty of pictures to commemorate such an entertaining night.\n\nOf course, as many fellow Yelpers already mentioned, AsiaSF is very pricey but you are paying more for the entertainment than you are for the food. I wouldn't go here just for the meals, so be warned if you're not interested in this type of entertainment ;) I don't think I would be willing to go unless it's during Dine About Town or for some special occasion.\n\nParking is plentiful (I went on a Sunday evening). According to the host and bartender, though, the level of entertainment tends to vary based on the crowd... so make sure you go on a Friday or Saturday night (if you can). Sunday was still fun, but they told me that it was an unusually fun Sunday crowd. Also, be sure to make a reservation!", "author": "Angela K."}

I came here expecting to see fully choreographed shows but it really was just more lip syncing and strutting from one end of the bar to the other. The food was also awful. I ordered some chicken base dish and the chicken was burned and dry. I took a bite and didn't touch anymore. Lastly, the cost was outrageous. This place supposedly offers all inclusive menus with an expensive option and a cheaper option but both were to include food and drinks. This was not true as at the end of the shows, my party's bill ended up being way over what I was told.

However, I did go to AsiaSF for a date, per my request because I was really curious about the unique waitresses/dancers there. We had a groupon though, so I guess that cut the bill back a bit. \n\nThe food is not bad, but it's not glorious enough for the price that you pay. For a normal party, there's a set price for a 3-course meal for about $50: a starter, main entree and dessert. Being Asian, I would say go for the seafood and meat. I got a tuna ahi starter that actually had more pieces of tuna than I expected (I expected 3, I got 6), and the ribs entree is pretty good. The desserts are solid, but again probably not worth the price. I got the 3 ice cream cone sample, and the flavors were exotic and quite yummy. I didn't finish it though, because I got distracted by a dancing show and my ice cream melted (and not just from the hotness of the dancers, haha jk.). The cocktails feature Asian-based flavors. The one I had was pretty good, but you know there isn't a lot of alcohol in it. Go figure.\n\nI would say you're definitely paying for the entertainment, and it's one of those SF checklist places. During a regular meal, you'll probably get 2 shows. We went late, so I saw the closing show, which ended with a runway walk and recognition of the girls. To make your meal worth it, stalk some of the hotter girls and take some pictures (because I definitely did)! If you're in a group, someone should do the blow shots or boob shots. Just saying. \n\nMy favorite moment of the night was when the hostess was introducing the dancers for the night. \"And this is ____. She's my sexy sistahhh. We used to be brothahhhhs.\" I don't know if that's biological fact, but it's hilarious either way. \n\nBottom line: go for the tranny shows, eat some food beforehand, drink some before you go especially if you might be traumatized that the dancers there are hotter than you, and make sure your experience is memorable. Chances are you won't be going back any time too soon.", "author": "Jen Y."}

The two stars are for the food being decent and a couple of the performers being pretty fantastic, but I was by and large pretty disappointed with the quality of performance and some really shady behavior by the downstairs staff.\n\nI'm a big drag fan, and, with a couple of fabulous exceptions, the entertainment team here seems to have focused on look to the detriment of talent. A couple of the ladies didn't even know the words to their song and seemed to think that wandering around looking beautiful was performing. FIERCE, fun, and really clever performances of \"Last Friday Night\" and \"I Need a Hero\" were the welcome exceptions. More of that, please.\n\nThen we went downstairs for drinks and dancing. The music was enh, but I was with great company, so it was okay. Then the floor show started and the MC was just...really weirdly aggressive with the women pulled up from the crowd to participate. Like it wasn't even cute or funny, just uncomfortable. After we went back to dancing, there was a woman fighting off a dude who was trying to manhandle her, so some of my friends and I intervened while someone went to alert security. One of the bouncers showed up and we turned the situation over to him. Apparently he just talked to the guy and then walked off and left he and the woman there, and the guy immediately started grabbing her again while she fought him off. My friends and I pulled him off of her again and wondered what the hell security was doing. Then the guy started trying to grab and shove us and told us this was his wife. Like that matters? It's okay to manhandle a woman in public while she tells you no if it's (maybe?) your wife? I guess that's what he told the bouncer, too, and that seemed like a good reason to him. One of our friends went and got a different security guy while we had to literally fight this guy off of ourselves and his possibly-wife. We left once we say that the second security guy kicked the dude out and made sure one of the woman's friends was on hand. Thanks for nothing, first security guy. In a club that's supposed to be woman-friendly with a mostly female clientele, there's no excuse for that. \n\nSo I don't know. I can see how some people could come here and have a different experience and a good time, but I can't see myself coming back. There's better (and apparently safer) entertainment, food, and dancing to be had elsewhere for less.", "author": "Vera C."}

I honestly dont know what happened in the last couple of years but this was so sad. To start with our drinks were only ok. I asked for something not sweet and got sweet. My friends were also less impressed with their drinks. The food was just short of horrible. We were actually comparing it to food you buy from the rotating vending machines. No flavor what so ever and of course they brought the wrong entree for my friend so she ended up not getting her main course for 20 minutes after the rest of us got ours. The dessert tasted like a low budget frozen food that had been heated in the cardboard box and then plopped on our plates. I actually could not believe how horrible it all was. The bartender noticed that none of us ate hardly any of our food but offered no alternatives, apology or other. \n\nFood is food whatever, we all know you really come here for the show right? That's were I wanted to cry. The show was...pathetic. There were only 3 ladies the entire time and I think the totally time they spent singing and dancing may have added up to 35 minutes. I felt like a false advertiser when we left here.

Where else are you going to find an experience like this but in San Francisco! The dining experience went from 7-10pm. We came in and got a free round of shots! For my 3-course I got the ahi burger (large appetizer, little overcooked ahi, flavorful), orange lamb (creative, small portion, nice taste), and for dessert I got the bread pudding (standard, with ice cream). Overall, the food was a 3.5/4 probably, nothing super special, but you don't come here for the food! The drinks though were fantastic! They were a bit steep for $12 each, but they were pretty large drinks and with lots of great mixes. Between each course they had a show where each of the girls would go on stage and dance to a hit musical number on the bar tables, shake all they got, while the drunken crowds screams in excitement! You can also take pictures with all the girls, they will photobomb your photos, and are just a lot of fun! This is a place you must check out when in SF!", "author": "Nikita K."}

In-laws were visiting this past weekend so guess where we ate?  \n\nSince my last visit, AsiaSF really has their sh*t together!  I love that there is one seating; tables are served at the same time; and you're out of there in 1hr 45 minutes.\n\nThe only con are drink prices. Even with a $50 TownHog coupon, our bill was over $200 for 4 people.  I think $35/person for a three course is a steal.  \n\nAll meals are sliced and diced for easy sharing so no one should order the same thing!\n\nAppetizer:  The beef salad was nothing exciting. The tuna sashimi and porcupines (scallops) were awesome. The dipping sauce on the chicken skewers were dee-lish.\n\nEntree: The filet mignon was charred perfectly well done. Orange lamb and ribs were also good but the ribs were a bit dry with only a minimal amount of sauce drizzled on top.\n\nDessert: Stick to the banana beignet or chocolate cake. The cones of the mini-ice cream cones were soggy from sitting so long. \n\nCocktails: Ciara's grapefruit drink and the lemon drop were the best. The mojito needed to be muddled more.\n\nEntertainment:  We sat at one end of the stage so we saw only about 50% of the singing.  They really keep the show moving by only singing about 90 seconds of popular songs.  Most of the time you are wondering about their boy bits and where they could possibly be hidden!\n\nTip: Get there early for the best seats.", "author": "Kim W."}

The cocktails were fun, delicious, and colorful - a fitting companion for the evening's entertainment.\n\nI ordered the mussels, the filet mignon, and the ice cream cone trio. The mussels were super tasty, although I wish the bread they came with had been served on the side. By the time I had finished the mussels the bread had fallen into the broth and was completely soaked. Oh well. My boyfriend ordered the porcupine (one of the appetizers - can't remember what it is but it was yummy), the salmon, and the chocolate cake.

We had a delicious dinner (at least what I can remember of it) with a spectacular show. The real fun was after dinner when we went downstairs. \n\nOf course I had to embarrass the hell out of my cousin by throwing her on stage with lady SF. That was beyond hilarious.

That stripper was so fine, too! \n\nThe bartenders downstairs were SO friendly. They hooked us up with some shots.

I found the staff to be very attentive, at the door, the floor and at the bar.

It's filled with the birthday, bachelorette, and other celebratory groups from upstairs.  All people who are in a great mood.  It's a very small space, kind of reminds me of someone's basement.

Left a voice message and was called back and warmly greeted. The male (can't recall his name) was helpful and told me how the whole thing goes and pricing before I even asked. Really nice guy - kudos to him!\n\nSo I arrived early with my friend since we're out from the East Bay. We took photos outside (btw, ours wasn't listed on the FB page womp - I know I didn't look busted haha). We were nicely greeted and escorted to the downstairs lounge as we were nearly 30 mins early. The bathrooms are ridiculously small downstairs, I can seriously wipe the person's a*s next to me. The downstairs lounge area was something interesting once we looked around. I bunch of drunk females hollering saying \"It's mah birfdaaay wooo!\" and there is always a token creepy dude at a club, never fails - but SF creepy dudes just take it to a kinky level. No like. We didn't stay after our dinner - my friends suggested another place, halleluyer!\n\nAnyways, we got seated near the door - okay spot, definitely the bar areas and high tables are the best places to sit but those looked reserved for bigger parties. Oh everyone were squeezed into these really small tables and areas - kinda annoying but we were seated the whole time, just a B when needing to get out.\n\nOur server is adorbs, the body on these...ahem, girls is insane. Brandi was a sweetheart and very beautiful. I didn't feel the pressure to get drinks like others mentioned. The performance were cool - not the level of Drag Queens but if you never seen one before, this is a good gateway drag show. Some songs weren't recognizable and one was country I believed (I remember it was kinda quiet during that performance... zzzz) but I give them credit for serving us and getting up there, that's a lot of work!\n\nFOOD\nI went through a lot of reviews here and went by what my friends recommended. I personally thought the food was really filling and it was pretty good, I really thought we'd have to hit Burger King across the street. And I'm a fatty so I would know. I ordered A La Carte:\n\nAhi-Burgers - pretty good, I would've preferred the tuna being a little bit more cooked but if you're like me and want something \"safe\" and familiar tasting (but with a twist) this is a good bet - they filled me up, came with four shooters.\n\nMy friend ordered the Chicken Shatays - meh, the chicken was dry.\n\nOrange Lamb - omg the thai cucumber salad was the BEST thing ever - it was so yummy. The lamb was okay, a bit too salty for my taste - I didn't finish it. I ate the salad with rice. The portion was good which is another reason why I couldn't finish it... I was sooo full.\n\nAll of my friends ordered the Sansho Filet Mignon. OMG, that was what I should've gotten. It was really good to me. I would've substituted my lamb w/ the filet for sure.\n\nWarm Chocolate Cake - It was alright, it's desserts - I liked the ice cream. I was expecting a dainty ass dessert but no, it was actually a lot.\n\nI would SKIP the alcohol - it's too expensive and I didn't even get a buzz.\n\nAMBIANCE\nDefinitely female driven place, it seems like every table were celebrating something. But it did give a good vibe, everyone dressed out and people were enjoying the experience.\n\nPRICE\nExpensive. For my party we each forked over $70. I wasn't expecting it to be that much. This is for our meal (a la carte) and one drink each + tip/tax. I knocked the point for that. It is definitely a splurge - I'm not one comfortable inviting people to spend this much on a dinner so make sure to let people know the minimum to dine here if they plan on too.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION/\nParty groups - birthday, bachelorette, etc. are best.\n\nOVERALL\nI was quite satisfied with the whole experience, it really was a memorable birthday but it isn't something I'd go too often but I will because my BFF LOVED it and plan on going again for her birthday. I did feel like I was somewhat \"forgotten\" in terms of getting recognition (my friend had to catch their attention) - maybe because we were a small group. The girls, manager and service were overall good.\n\nI LOVE Drag and these are more on the tranny side, which is awesome in itself but no where near the same level of performance like a Drag Queen. I much prefer going to the Cafe for a show & cheap drinks and then dine at a different location. This is definitely something to experience at least once or a few times and for me I think once is enough and that's saying a lot.\n\nALSO...\nApparently with the food and some folks feeling cheated by the small amount, my friends who's been here often said they noticed with bigger parties the food portion is small whereas when they came with me it wasn't. Maybe some should take that into consideration.", "author": "Celia Z."}

She's uncomfortably attractive!!\"\nand\n\"I can't believe I'm actually here... and enjoying it\" were some of the things the men in our group said for my best friends birthday.\n\nA few of the girls and I decided not to tell some of the guys that the gorgeous ladies on stage are/were actually men, and for a while they bought it until they heard the host speak! Their eyes popped open wide and a couple even dropped jaws upon realizing that these \"ladies\" were just a very good illusion. That's right fellas, not your average restaurant! These girls were the nicest and they loved taking pictures with us! They even gave a birthday shout-out to my friend that night, and we held the belt for being the loudest and the liveliest group of the evening - coz that's how we roll ;)\n\nFor my best friend's birthday we went with the Golden Feast dinner, which included:\n1st course: \n- Tamarind Chicken Satay http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/wSBWsv1YJspOiBbEof6p9w/l\n- Porcupines http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/lCT0BtzT4W_aOZIwL_tptw/l\n- Asiadilla http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/vDS_6CgmngWFpRwAjCvZpQ/l\n- Ahi Burgers http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/Du3JvAkTbxafQMB_K6TA8A/l\n- Sesame Steak Salad http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/8FjCZVcz7BjgIYRAACUUTA/l\n2nd course:\n- Baby Got Back Ribs http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/AUwrbTZlt8ol6qFEH4WvVA/l\n- Truffled Soba Noodles http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/Yqc8Trn0PVSpnV2BKKc60Q/l\n- Orange Lamb http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/KVpGdJVKARVbwz_FFSvm6A/l\n\nThe food was great, a few were light on the flavor, and some were bursting with it! Either way, I enjoyed it. My favorite dish of the evening was the Truffled Soba Noodles, and Porcupines. I just wished it came in bigger portions because it wasn't enough to fill us up, and the price per person didn't exactly make it worthy.. I don't recommend coming here starving if you're  with a big party.\n\nWe had 14 people that evening ($38+/person) plus drinks and a 20% gratuity, and the total bill came out to ~$860. A very expensive dinner but with this came the hilarious and worth-while entertainment that makes me want to come back for more (I'll probably throw my birthday soiree here!). \n\nDownstairs there's a live DJ, bar, and a room with a stripper pole for those who reserved it. Come down to boogie while you wait for your seats! If you make it downstairs in time, you can even catch a \"performance\" for a birthday or bachelorette party from one of the ladies.\n\nAfter visiting Asia SF, I almost want to get surgery because they looked that stunning. I'm all woman and I don't ever remember looking THAT hot. Am I jealous? Yes, of course! Surgery does wonders!!\n\nTo the Asia SF ladies, you are hot shit!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-21", "description": "I have to admit that I thought the concept behind this restaurant - lip-syncing gender illusionists strutting on top of a bar serving as their runway - was on the cheesy side, clearly designed to attract tourists too afraid to go into a Castro bar. But it's all done in such a harmless manner that it's hard to resist. It is not the most ideal of places, and if you are a party of three like we were on a particularly crowded night, you are squeezed onto the bar regardless of whether or not you have a reservation. I have been here twice before, both times with work colleagues, and remember thinking each time that it was rather pricey given the bar atmosphere and also a hefty cover charge for the entertainment. \n\nSince my last visit over two years ago, the restaurant has responded by providing a fixed price menu, $30 per person for an appetizer, main dish and dessert or after dinner drink. When you multiple the dishes by three, you have quite a feast, and the food is surprisingly good given the restaurant's priorities. For the appetizers, we ordered a particularly succulent chicken satay, a concoction called an \"Asia-dilla\", a transplanted quesadilla filled with smoked duck breast, jack cheese and scallions; and the best of the trio, hearty crabcakes with a green papaya salad. For the entrees (though everything is served on small plates making them indistinguishable from the appetizers), we shared tender filet mignon slices served with finger potatoes cut into star shapes (for no apparent reason); lamb medallions with a not-too-overpowering orange sauce; and a quartered ahi tuna burger.\n\nThey also do a fine job on their standard selection of desserts: a flourless chocolate cake and their showpiece, the banana beignet split for two. Believe me, you will be more than stuffed as you watch the \"girls\" perform at 15-minute intervals, three in a row in an appropriately tongue-in-cheek manner in some revealing get-ups. In some though not all cases, the show becomes a is-he-or-isn't-he episode of \"The Crying Game\". It does get noisy, as the bar is the centerpiece and the surrounding tables are generally filled with groups of rowdy, camera-toting tourists. But give it a try as you may be pleasantly surprised by the experience...at least the culinary experience.\n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars \nSERVICE - 3 stars\nENTERTAINMENT - 3.5 stars \nOVERALL - 3 stars", "author": "Ed U."}

I was just there last weekend for a friend's birthday party and it was the first time I've been to the 2nd showing on Saturday and it was awesome.

Their signature cocktails are very tasty, not really strong but nonetheless very good to drink while you watch the show. \n\nI've been here at least once a year for the past 4 years, the menu has been the same and I've tried all of the set menus already.

Reservations were made for 12. The menu set.\nMy excitement grew as did the party. One week prior I had to call and change the party from 12 to 23 (we're popular). The man that handled this request was even more polite and charming than the woman I had originally spoken with. Awesome. I'm a sucker for great customer service.\n\n     As a guy, I find the location of the restaurant charmingly gritty. A few panhandlers, some schizophrenics and graffiti make it seem a little dangerous, but I like that. A girl might feel uneasy but walk in groups and carry pepper spray.\nI love my friends and family and tend to make my birthday about them having fun and feeling fabulous- the step-and-repeat worked like a charm. Pose, flash, vogue, attitude. Fun!\n\n     The interior will throw you off so don't try anticipating what it'll look like. I don't know if I liked it or not but we were rushed downstairs for some shots and drinks at the bar. Friendly bartenders and good drinks (I was afraid they wouldn't make stiff ones). We all had plenty to drink (the restaurants gameplan. Ours too) and were whisked to our 3 adjoining tables. Sadly, 4 members of this gigantic party never showed and while waiting for them I could sense some severe attitude from one of the entertainer/hostesses. She was beautiful but her diva eye-rolling and sly remarks pissed me off. I'm not some straight bachelorette that can be undercut. I let her know and thought I would hate everything that followed. \nWrong. I'm gay. I've seen Rupaul's Drag Race. I do drag every Halloween. I have transgendered friends. I wasn't prepared to be as impressed as I was with the performances. When the diva with the attitude finished her routine I was out of my seat clapping and cheering... These ladies are true entertainers destined to be on stage and their abilities were even more impressive than their stunning looks.\n\n     The food was really good. You could tell it cost them nothing to make (chicken satay, noodles, etc) but it was tasty enough for a bunch of drunks. Then the bill. Even if I hadn't been charged for the party guests who never showed I would have choked upon receiving the tab. In my opinion, overcharging for food and drinks and making the pre set menu over implicated cheapens the work of these A-List performers. No matter. I'd still return at the drop of a hat because when one of the performers (Amber) was working it on the bar to Rihanna's S&M wearing a bustier and boots while swinging a riding crop, every single party guest was in awe. They cheered, fist pumped and shouted \"go girl\" until their voices were hoarse.\nI should be upset. I should miss the $130 I was charged for the missing guests. I should feel bad that guests over drank and over spent because the establishment makes it very easy to do and, obviously, on purpose but I'm not. I had a great time and you will too.", "author": "Kurtis G."}

We started the night off with a couple cocktails (was going to need them).

Needless to say, a first.Thanks everyone. \n\nWe ended up ordering and enjoying our meals, and then that's when the fun began, during our dinner, several entertainers began walking pass us and then began parading along the top of the bar.

My friend couldn't stop gawking and was told numerously by his wife to close his mouth. \n\nWe ended the night downstairs, watching another side show where a volunteer joined in an seemed to have a great time.

As the only male in my party, I got a little extra attention, which was appreciated.\n\nBeing a bigger guy, the bar stool I was seated on got a bit uncomfortable after awhile. But this was my only real complaint. The other thing that bugged me (just a little) was I went for lemonade, which at most places is a fountain beverage. Unfortunately at AsiaSF it's a bar beverage (so no free refills), and kinda pricey for something without any booze. And of course, I wasn't informed of this. Yeah. But I got off cheaper than most of the people I was with, tbh.\n\nThe women I was with were a bit more critical about the food, saying it wasn't so hot given what we paid, but really I didn't notice.

WOW. I'm sorry, I would not ask of that from any of my friends. BUT, they WERE enjoyable to watch... especially so because the girls getting the lap dances were really quite funny.

Also hated how they kept trying to take the dinner plates away even though we weren't done with the food yet.

Every like 20 minutes all the lights would go to the stage and a tranny would sing some popular song dressed like whoever actually sang it.

They pulled my friend Nicole on stage and she danced right with the foxy tranny and totally shocked her by giving her a big smackeroo right on the lips, leaving both the dancer and the emcee totally speechless. \n\nAll in all, it was good times. I would be lying if I said the copious amounts of alcohol served and champagne bottles popped didn't leave both Nicole and I hugging the porcelain throne. \n\nMy only gripe about Asia SF?

Everything from Paul (PPP) who was great and easy to talk to and followed up when he said he would. The door man who was all smiles and courteous, to the bartender Hank who made us feel so welcome.  Plus, our performer who dressed as a cowgirl who matched our bride-to-be cowgirl!  Not sure if that was planned but if it was bravo!

(It's listed as $45 on the website.... so I'm not sure how I managed to get a cheaper deal.)\n\n[[ Appetizers ]]:  I tried the Mussels & the Blackened Tuna Sashimi.  The Sashimi came with six pieces of tuna on a few scattered shreds of pickled veggies (mostly daikon), and then a pile of pickled ginger on the side.    The Mussels came in a giant bowl, with some broth/sauce, and four pieces of crispy french bread.  The broth was perfect for dipping, and this overall could have passed for a meal on it's own.  The clear winner here were the Mussels.\n\n[[ Entree ]]:  How unoriginal - all 4 people in my party ordered the Filet Mignon.  It was tasty though.  Just a word of warning - they will cook all of the meat the same (medium rare) despite how you request it.  (My table's requests ranged from medium to rare.)  I didn't have any problems with this, as it still came out tasty.  Not the best steak ever, but pretty darn good.  The steak comes out pre-cut for you, and also wide some star-shaped potato wedges!  How cute!\n\n[[ Dessert ]]:  The Chocolate Cake was actually a molten lava chocolate cake!!  And it came with a side of vanilla ice cream!   However, I preferred my Pineapple Cheesecake, which came with diced pieces of pineapple (baked) on top of my cheesecake, and some raspberries/blackberries on the periphery.  The serving sizes of the desserts were pretty hefty.  I was impressed by the quality and the quantitiy.\n\nENTERTAINMENT:\n\nThere's 2 short performances/dances by the ladies on top of the bar.  They wear some hot outfits, show off their hot bodies, and put me to shame at my lack of femininity.\n\nSome of these gender illusionists were quite convincing.  We came here with one male friend who didn't know what the 'theme' of the restaurant was beforehand.  He didn't catch on til we told him after the first performance.\n\nThere's a bar and dance floor downstairs, but it wasn't open on the Sunday night that I was there. \n\nETC:\n\nGet a blowjob shot from one of the servers!\n\nMake reservations beforehand!  They have fixed seating each night.\n\nExpect to ultimately pay a decent amount of money ($50+) per person in the end.  The meal, drinks, and random fees (health tax) added up to be quite a bit (even after our $50 gift certificate).\n\nFree shot for checking in on Yelp!  Thanks Yelp!", "author": "Jeanne L."}

There I was, talking with the hostess, thinking \"wow, she looks like Emma Watson, only hotter\"... but I had to stop right there as I realized what was hiding inside that mini-dress.\n\nWe were greeted at the bar by our bartender and server, a very pleasant hunk of a gentleman whose name escapes me.  Throughout the night, he kept a keen eye on us, kept refilling our drinks, and even poured us a few free shots.  Five star service from a man in a tight t-shirt!  The drinks were mixed very well and were quite strong!\n\nWhile the menage-a-trois options seem quite appetizing on the menu, they aren't as good as one would hope.  The presentation is five-star (literally, I had five star-shaped potatoes with my main course!), but the consistency only gets a three: our tuna sashimi had been frozen at some point, and our main courses were served warm and eaten cold.  \n\nThe desserts were a mixed bag: my lady had a delicious banana split, but my cheesecake was more cheesey than cakey.  A free glass of port appeared beside my dessert, and washed down any bitterness I might've had about the food.  More kudos to our server!\n\nThe entertainment was beyond my wildest dreams, and I have some wild dreams.  (No, really, last night, my cat and I were fighting Nazis with toothpicks in a shopping mall)  Asia SF's performers are great dancers; they really knew how to work the crowd... both with their sexy moves and some raunchy comedy thrown in for good measure.\n\nAlthough the experience comes with a substantial price tag (about $60 per person on a Sunday night, including drinks and tips) I have to say it was all worth it.  The service and entertainment really made the night.  The food is forgettable, but the night was definitely memorable!\n\nI'll be back for more... the eye candy is sooo tasty!", "author": "Jason H."}

Or in our case, a bachelor party. Yes, I'm sure they don't get too many of those since they made the mistake of thinking it was a bachelorette party multiple times. But we wanted to take one of our best guy friends, whose always \"been one of the girls\" to a fun night out. And we def found it here. We made reservations a few weeks ahead of time. And were able to change it a few times without issues as our party grew bigger. They have several dining options that go along with the show. And depending on what you get to eat or the day/time you come in, it's different prices. We ordered the platinum menu, mostly because it came with some seafood, which is the bachelor's favorite. I should've not had an early dinner because it was so much food. Decent food and better than expectations. I remember the salmon with the black forbidden rice and seared tuna, and coconut rice that was under something as well as the mini ice cream cones for dessert. The drinks are separate and while they have a full bar, it's much more interesting to order one of their (dirty-named) $12 concoctions. The entertainment was much more exciting. They are very pretty women and they sure know how to dance on top of the \"bar.\" And they like to engage the crowd - one of ours was called up to \"play\" with the ladies. And for each tables guest of honor, they bring around a shot to be drank in a unique way. I think we read online it was supposed to be less than 2 hours but it ended up being more like 3 hours in total from our reservation time. Afterwards, they even let you go downstairs to their small bar/club. There was a little bit more entertainment for some the guest of honors but mostly a DJ a playing and people dance.

We made reservations for the show, and my ONLY complaint was the 30ish minute despite having a reservation beforehand BUT we were led downstairs to the dance floor/bar so it wasn't too bad. The dinner was amazing (I had ribs and d/t too many Nya's Razzledazzle, which is an amazing drink, I can't really remember what else) and dinner alone, was well worth the cost. The show, however, was SOOO much fun! The performers were amazing and involved the guests more than once, and offered \"blow job shots\" for the newcomers, which is a hilarious experience, esp once you've been drinking. The bartenders (which is where we were seated upstairs) were very friendly and accommodating and came down and danced with us after their shift was over. I went outside to smoke and the bouncers were equally as lovely and kept an eye out for me as I was more than a little inebriated. After the show, you have the option to go back downstairs to the club portion, which we definitely did. It was Latin music night and even though I didn't know any of the songs, we still had a great time. When we were ready to leave, one of the bartenders went and stood in the street for around 5 minutes to get us a taxi as well.

There were two sets with two songs each. If you've been to Thailand before, it's similar but more intimate and there's food.\n\nTip: The servers come around asking each table if they're celebrating anything. Even if you're not, say you're there for a birthday. The \"birthday\" boy in our group got a free blowjob shot out of one of the ladyboy's cleavage!\n\nSince I'm the type that goes to AsiaSF and takes more pictures of the food than of the \"gender illusionists\", my review is focused more on the food. I came with a group of 5 and we did the M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois (unfortunately, not THAT kind) - where each person picks an appy, entr\u00e9e, and dessert.

It's really a simple set up- crowded tables and bar in the restaurant upstairs and club, bar and private rooms (separated by a curtain and screens) downstairs.\n\nInstead of eating hella bread here (yup we were served garlic bread), I broke hella bread here. A whopping $130 dollars/head later, we basically had finger foods for dinner and I don't even think we were served our whole menu. We had chicken satay, sauteed bok choy, duck quesadillas, jasmine rice and garlic bread. No dessert. Bummer because upstairs I saw people feasting on these tiny ice cream cones. I figured we basically paid for our private room and male (Yes I was sure he was male. I had to ask before we got here and upon checking him out, yes he was 100% male. Metro yea (he had a waxed body). Gay? Who knows? Who cares?) entertainment. We asked what the rules were and the host said, \"Rules? There are no rules!\" Basically you can have your Backdraft/Rescue Me moment here.

That last person on the bar gets lots of attention from the performers!  Also, as they are dancing, their feet/shoes are just inches from your food, so if you're a germaphobe or allergic to dirt, just be warned!\n\nThe food, however, was not that great.  Had the mussels for first course, which was HUGE.  The flavors weren't bad, but not very memorable.  Then had the lamb, which was reminescent of PF Chang's food.  No bueno.

They are glamorous, fabulous, and gorgeous!\n\nI went here with some friends for a birthday celebration. We arrived a bit early and was seated promptly at the time of our reservation, which was 7:00 pm on a Sunday evening. From the outside, this place doesn't look at all happening, but once you walk inside, you'll find changing lights on the walls with a nice-sized bar in the middle of the restaurant. This place is small, but I prefer to call it intimate. \n\nEach of us ordered 3 dishes: first course, main dish, and dessert. As your typical Asian group of friends, we decided to share our dishes to get the most out of the experience. For me, I ordered the shrimp and herb salad (b/c I really wanted something light and veggies). It was okay, not super amazing, but I did enjoy the tangy Vinaigrette dressing. For my main dish, I ordered the miso salmon. It was a pretty big piece of fish and sat on top of black \"forbidden\" rice with a sweet tomato-edamame salad. Not sure exactly what this forbidden rice was, but it was delicious. Finally, for dessert, I ordered banana beignet split.. yum, lots of ice-cream dressed with chocolate sauce and bananas wrapped in lumpia. YUM. For drinks, I ordered lemon drop, but I would recommend the  one with lychee in it. Don't remember the name; that's how delicious it was. ;o) So overall, the food was pretty good and the price was very reasonable.\n\nNow, these ladies of Asia SF are beautiful. They make me jealous of their womanly bodies! The show was amazing; I wished it lasted longer. The show happens on the bar stage throughout dinner and then we had a blow out show at the end of dinner. Because it was my friend's birthday, she got to take a body shot from one of the ladies. Free shots = win. This place is indeed the place to go for celebrations of any type!\n\nIf you haven't been, you should definitely go check out the ladies of Asia SF today!

The food being as good as it was to me was the biggest surprise of the whole experience.  Everything was well prepared and served so everyone at the table could try a little bit.  I would say it's best for everyone to order something different so everyone can try a little bit of all the dishes.  My favorite was the Orange Lamb, which had surprising little (not too much) spicy kick.  The Beef Fillet, Chicken Skewers, and Baby Got Back Ribs were also very, very good.  I would have loved to take home some of the orange sauce from the lamb and the dipping sauce from the chicken skewers.  The deserts were also good and they can also be shared with everyone at the table.  I had the mini ice cream cones and the ice cream in them was good, but the cones themselves weren't that great.  I'd say my favorite was the Banana Beinet and the Chocolate Lava Cake.  \n\nThe show was a lot of fun and you have to see it in person.  Some of the performers are unreal (pardon the pun), really get into the show, and make sure everyone is having a good time.\n\nWe ordered some drinks and the Ciara's grapefruit drink was probably my favorite.  I also got a Mojito, which was only OK.  It could have been a little sweeter and had more mint, and the mint could have been muddled a little more.\n\nNow for the not so good.  We were one of the first to get seated, but it seemed like a lot of the tables around us had placed their orders before us and were always a course ahead of us.  There Like I said before, the drinks were good, but at $10 each were a bit steep.  We were one of the first in the place and we ended up being seated right near the door, which was open the entire time they were seating everyone else and was cold and drafty.

Otherwise it is a fun, safe environment to have a blast.  I have come for bachelorette parties as well as I have brought my mom.  Both occasions were a lot of fun.  The entertainment is professional and amazing!  I am impressed with their mobility on such high heals. \n\nFood is good.  The set meal fills everyone with good food.  I like to share each course.  The tuna and crab cakes are my favorite First Course.  The filet mignon and lamb are my favorite Seconds and the chocolate cake and banana split are wonderful desserts.  We always leave a bit of food because the portions are reasonable with 3-courses.  \n\nThe small club downstairs is fun if you want to continue the party after dinner.

This time I just went with one other person (last time it was with a group of friends). What I liked most about going with just one other person is that they sit you at the bar for dinner and those are for sure the best seats in the house! We had great customer service from the bartenders at all times! The show was amazing and entertaining! They were different performers from last time and different performances! It's a huge plus that their show isn't a repetitive show! The food and drinks did not dissapoint me at all! I would definitely come here again and again!", "author": "Emily P."}

It gets crowded within your own table so be prepared to have your personal space invaded. Service (once your food was delivered) was pretty good. One of our servers told us that she wanted us fed, which we loved because we were all starving! We did have to wait about 30mins once seated before our food arrived. Then the show began and it was so much fun! Lots of laughing and dancing and cheering! The girls are great and they interact well with the customers! The last show before the night ended, one of the dancers, I believe Aaliyah? spotted my friend and performed one of the girls' infamous motorboat dance and even crotch-in-face dance. HILARIOUS! The girls were great hostesses and my guests were having a great time!\n\nSince it was my birthday our server, Donna or Darna?, called me up to where the stage was and had me do a BJ shot between her crotch. Oh boy, that was pretty intense because I wasn't sure how it was going to play out. I had a lot of fun!!\n\nWe had the gold menu and received lots of food! The asia-dilla was pretty good, as was the porcupine puffs, steak salad, ahi-tuna sandwich, and soba noodles. The chicken sticks were also delicious. I loved the three different types of ice cream (Filipino flavors!) presentation. \n\nAfterwards, we went downstairs to the club which is what I had imagined after reading reviews. It's small and poorly ventilated. Thank goodness for the fans that were turned on otherwise I would've fainted. My friends had a great time twirling and dancing on the pole. My friend also said the bartenders were a lot of fun and even gave her a birthday spanking! \n\nI'd love to come back but it is a bit pricey. Be prepared to drop a lot of $$$.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-18", "description": "I came here to celebrate my birthday recently and it was so much fun! First of all, the big draw here is obviously the entertainment. These ladies sure know how to put on a good show. If you're looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday or bachelorette party, AsiaSF is a great option. There was even a bachelor party so this place isn't just for the girls. \n\nI'm a glamour girl and I love anything campy and out there, so this is my kind of place. If you like anything in the following list, you should check this place out: huge tits, shapely asses and legs that make you do a double take, large hair, sparkly costumes, hot ladyboys who are prettier than you, sassy humor, and doing shots held between a ladyboy's massive silicone DD's. Before coming here, I'd never felt fake boobies before. So how do they feel? Kind of hard and silicone-like. Go squeeze a waterballoon if you're curious...or come here on your birthday. Haha. \n\nEntertainment aside, the food here is actually very good. The standout dish was the \"baby got back\" ribs. They were ah-mazing. Very tender and just bursting with flavor. I was pigging out on these. The lamb was good too. The food is all served family style so it's fun to come with a group. You'll get to try many dishes. Portions are on the small side but you don't want to get too full because you'll be dancing downstairs later. The ice-cream cones also came in Filipino inspired flavors and it was the perfect thing to end the meal. \n\nIf you join their mailing list on their official website, you'll get a special birthday email so I definitely recommend doing that. You get to eat for FREE on the week of your birthday if you bring in a group of 4 or more people. On your birthday, you get a personalized menu with your name printed on it, a shoutout before and after the show, and a special birthday shot that'll definitely give you and your friends a good memory of your celebration. They really go out of their way to make you feel special here on your special day. Celebrating here is actually one of the best birthday parties I've ever had and my friends all had a great time. They also take photos for you and the photos are available for free the day after on their official Facebook page. Best of all, it's actually very reasonably priced considering the quality of food, great service, and entertainment. Don't forget to tip well. You also get a free shot if you check in on the Yelp app. \n\nLadies, if you come here, get dolled up and bring your A-game! You don't want to come here in jeans and a t-shirt. Even with me getting dressed up and doing my hair and makeup, I still felt kind of outshined by the hot ladies here. These girls know how to work it! It was so much fun to dress up though. Any place that gives me the chance to bust out my huge feather fascinator automatically makes me happy. Thank you for the memories, AsiaSF! You ladies are a class act!\n\nAnother plus: plentiful street parking close by at night. Not easy to find in San Francisco! Huge plus!", "author": "Nancy C."}

The two issues I had are that 1) my friends had to chase down the wait staff a few times to refresh drinks and 2) they charged us for shots that were supposed to be free because we checked in online. I wasn't aware of that until after the bill was paid and I mentioned it to someone the next day. The show was fun to watch and many of the songs were old time favorites, but the staff's lack of service made the experience less thsn ideal. Once was enough for me.", "author": "Kathy H."}

You get good food, alcohol, dance floor, and sexy staff all under one roof. GENIUS and I'm jealous cuz I wish I came up with this place.\n\n$50/person and you are granted 2 hrs at your table to enjoy the food (3 course meal) and show.  There's a bar and dance floor downstairs for you to get the party started as you wait for a table and you can return downstairs to continue your partying after the dinner.  You can easily drop $100/person the whole night.  Be prepared.  Birthday/bachelorette guests have the honor of taking a blow job shot between an entertainers legs or between the boobies.  Straight guy friend motor boated the hostess of the evening.  It was the most butt wild, interactive, sexy dinner party I've ever attended.

I didn't know what to expect besides food and a show.  \n\nWe walked in and was greeted by their friendly staff.  We had a party of 19 so the seating arrangement was kind of tight.  The seats are really slippery.  My friend almost fell off his stool and I glided on the booth with ease.  At least we know the seating is clean :)  I was comfy on the booth side, but people on the stools were not as comfortable.\n\nThe ladies there are beautiful inside and out.  I got nothing but positive attitudes and a great show.\n\nFood: preset dinner.  Family style in tapa portions.  It was just enough for everyone where you won't over eat and go into a food coma.  \n\nThere were a few dishes that was a complete miss where it tasted nothing like the description.  The soba was too sour and the least favorite of the night.  \n\nThe salmon had a description of a miso glaze, but it just tasted like grilled salmon.  The salmon was good nonetheless.\n\nThe blackened ahi tuna was good, but I wished there was Wasabi and soy sauce to go with it.\n\nOther than those few things, the food was enjoyable.\n\nIt is a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely an experience.  You also get access to their lounge afterwards so that's a plus.", "author": "Michelle S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-21", "description": "Came here several weekends ago for a friend's bachelorette party.  Upon planning the party, I remembered having fun at Asia SF years ago when I first came for a friend's 24th birthday party, and so figured reserving platinum dinner seats for the bride-to-be and her friends would be a fun way to start off a night which would end with some dancing at the Asia SF club.\n\nWe arrived on time and were seated 10-15 minutes later.  The menu was as I remembered it--uneven in quality.  For every delicious portion, such as the asia-dilla, there were two crappy ones such as the orange lamb and truffled soba noodles (flavors and textures were just not good).  The performers were just as uneven as the food.  For every smoking hot gender illusionist who could shimmy and pout like no one's business, there were two who lazily/boringly strolled up and down the bar and/or didn't pull off the illusion that well.  My recommendation:  more dancing, less strolling and vogueing.\n\nMy first time at Asia SF was a four star experience due to the novelty of it all, but it definitely gets old by your second visit. Also, the experience is very expensive.  Therefore, I recommend that everyone go once, but no more.\n\nTIPS FOR BACHELORETTE PARTIES:\n\nCLUB:  The music spun at the club is not good at all.  I really don't want to hear \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\" remixed with a beat.  Heck, I'd rather dance to a top 40 radio station broadcast--commercials and all.  My recommendation:  If you ask, Asia SF will provide you with a list of clubs in the vicinity (for free).  Hit up one of these instead of wasting time at Asia SF after dinner.\n\nSPOTLIGHT SHOW:  Do not opt for a package with this inclusion as it is basically a tongue-in-cheek, 5 minute lapdance for the bride-to-be by one of their \"ladies\".  It's over quickly, takes place in their club on a non-elevated stage in front of the public, and is not that glamorous.  \n\nFirst visit:  4 stars.\nSecond visit:  3 stars.", "author": "Momo R."}

The place is pretty packed and rowdy but got even better as our food and entertainment started.  Food wise it was just ok.  Some items were amazing while others fell flat.  I did like the porcupine ball or whatever it's called but it definitely isn't of \"fresh\" seafood variety since I did end up breaking out in a small rash (go go internal freshness meter of mine).  Although pleasing to the eyes food wasn't something that wow-ed me.\n\nDrinks were pretty decent of the fruity cocktail variety and had fun names so that was ok as well.\n\nAs for entertainment that was awesome.  Our table was semi close to the bar so we got to see the show well.  All the ladies were beautiful and super nice and worked in their performances.  I'd go back mainly for the performances if anything.\n\nAfterwards we went downstairs where the bar/club is.  It was an interesting crowd...a lot of bachelorette parties I believe.

There were probably 7 bachelorette parties present, but we definitely had it made since our area was cordoned off.  If you're going to have a party downstairs, definitely get the VIP section since you can get food served to your group and there's enough space to dance without fighting the mobs on the main dance floor.  You can also bring in decorations and party favors to give your party that extra 'lil something-something.\n\nAs far as the place itself - the food was OK (the fried dishes rocked though), the drinks were WEAK and pricey, the servers were efficient and clean, the guy overseeing our section was awesome, the crowd was young, loud, and friendly, the music is dance-o-licious, and the tranny performers kicked ass.", "author": "Vicente G."}

This is because there are two dance shows by the \"girls\" during dinner. All of the girls were obvious but one looked ok from far. This place is more fun with a group of friends and drinking. If you want to embarrass your friend, this might be the place to go because the birthday person might get their face smooched into some fake $@&$. The food was well below average and parties less than five or six are required to do a three course menu. This is for the show. So if you're looking for good food, pass on this place.

We had a coupon, $25 for $50 to spend which basically covers for one person's 3-course. There were a lot of bachelorette parties and a lot of smaller groups. The setting is intimate and engaging, so you'll have fun no matter how many people you come with.\n\nPARKING: You can easily find free parking on the street.\n\nSHOW: Fun and entertaining. Each girl performed a song on the bar. I sat at the bar so the show was in front of me, but you can enjoy the show from any seat. If you're going with a small group with a boy, ask them if you can sit at the end of the bar because the girls interact with the person sitting there, and it was hilarious watching the same guy react nervously haha. Some of the girls were pretty and could really pass as female born!\n\nFOOD: \n-The food was decent for the total price, surprisingly better than what I expected. We ordered and I recommend the steak salad, blackened tuna sashimi, and the filet mignon. We did not enjoy the baby got back ribs as much as other reviewers, but it comes with a good amount! \n-For dessert, I got the miniature ice cream cones and they were so cute and yummy. Bf got a dessert drink since he was stuffed. \n\nDRINKS & SERVICE: Were GREAT! \n-Check into Yelp to unlock a free signature shot! They were served in cute little glassware with stem, like a mini wine glass. Very yummy!\n-We then ordered the mojito and lychee breeze, which were both also good. Mojito with perfect amount of liquor and lychee breeze was sweet and girly for me. \n- The owner kept coming over to say that we were a gorgeous couple and the bartender said it a few times too. I'm sure they say this to many other people, but I'm not gonna lie, it was nice to hear! \n- When the owner headed out, he came over to say bye to the \"gorgeous couple\" and gave us two free drink vouchers for the club downstairs. And when we finished eating, the bartender gave us another two vouchers!! He even added, \"go all out and get top shelf guys.\"\n- All the staff were friendly and dancing along to the music while working. Looked like they enjoyed their job. At one point, they forgot one of our orders, but I didn't really mind since the show was still going on. I just told them and they brought it out.\n- While waiting for our food, my bf and I decided to get a blow job and muff diver (guy version). It was definitely a crowd pleaser, so much that both shots were on our lovely bartender, Carlos! Because afterwards, we got a bunch of people ordering them too. \n- In total, we got 8 complimentary drinks! Wassupp ;)\n\nTook our vouchers downstairs and redeemed our drinks. We actually like the basement. Although the dance floor was sparse, we had a lot of fun dancing just the two of us. There's also a pole if you're good at that!\n\nDefinitely a fan.

I put together a surprise b-day for my bf here and it was worth the costs.  So fair warning, weekdays and weekends have different setting since I believe the place becomes a club on the weekends.  I went on a Wed.  \n\nSo, what happened?  First, from the outside, it looks like shitty shack, and once you walk in you find yourself in this sorta pretty nice, low-lit bar/restaurant place, which you wouldn't expect judging the book by its cover (happens a lot in SF).  Second, you'll get seated either at the bar or the high tables, and so far nothing out of the ordinary.  Once the show starts, it starts to get entertaining as these hot asian babes(?) come out, one at a time to give you their little dance show for the customers.  Little did all my friends know, all the dancers were trans and very beautiful for that matter.  They ended turning to me after every dance routine and asked \"is she a he?!\"  It was hilarious to see so many men sooooooooo confused.  \n\nAnyway, mostly pros:\n1) The show was entertaining.\n2) Great food.  I really didn't expect to have a good show + good food.  Usually its either one or the other.  \n3) They will give you b-day requests on the house usually.  \n4) One performer all of a sudden made out with a guy at a bar.  So I'll let you judge this one.  \n\nCons:\n1) Cost, but it's worth it I believe.\n2) Sorta in a shady looking place.\n3) Closes early on the weekdays.", "author": "Vannie N."}

Not to mention, each drink there was between $10-$15.  \n\nThe 'girls 'aren't as hot as everyone is saying (anything can be done with surgery, people!) and my friend was a little uncomfortable when she was called up for a lap dance and was groped and encouraged to grope the girl (who was recycled through the other 5 bachelorettes there).  \n\nThe two stars were for the food - quite delicious, actually, with yummy sauces for every dish...but still not worth all that money.", "author": "Tram T."}

I went with the sesame tofu salad, grilled salmon, chocolate cake and would recommend any of them.  Others in my group liked the tuna sashimi and filet mignon. \n\n After the starter course was three dance numbers (a Gwen Stefani medley, Christina Aguilera and Katy Perry).  After dessert, there was another stage show with dances to Natalie Cole, Britney Spears, Bjork, and Ke$ha (I hate Ke$ha as a human being, but damnit, Take It Off is really catchy).  The girls are great and very dedicated.  One girl cut her foot and kept dancing, even though her shoe was filling with blood.\n\nI've been to my fair share of West Hollywood wet t-shirt contests, and compared to that Asia SF is moderately tame.

Unfortunately, we were under the impression that we would be paying $45 each, plus a $20 corkage fee (making our total $155), but when we got our bill, it had gone up to $240.

I have been trying to obtain a copy of my receipt, but have not been able to contact anyone directly, and have not received a response. This doesn't seem to be a common issue, but we were pretty upset about being charged $85 more than expected.

It's weird how after the age of 22 going out just doesn't seem as fun as it used to. However, I was in DESPERATE need of sum good ole' fashioned, knock you on your ass, head in the toilet, drinking. Plus I wanted a little entertainment. I had heard about Asia SF and if there's two things I love its Asians and drag queens so I knew this was going to be the spot. Making reservations was simple and painless although I didn't get the time I originally wanted since I chose the cheapest package on the menu (gold, $38).

In fact, they gave us extra, complimentary dishes. And the food was delicious, (ahi burgers...yum). Not the highest quality but tasty nonetheless. If you're a vegetarian though I suggest you eat beforehand. Besides, we were too busy watching the flawlessly beautiful ladies of Asia SF do their thing on the catwalk.

I've only been here once where a normally boring Tuesday night was \"trans\"-cended into the most social night of the week.  It felt like a comfortably loud Friday night. \r\n\r\nLord knows on actual Friday nights, it must be a zoo.\r\n\r\nThe food tastes very good.  The alcohol is readily available served by a hot woman who is not what she seems.\r\n\r\nThen, about every hour or so, you have drag queens (transvestites or trans-sexuals? who knows) do dances to classic 70s and 80s tunes.  The best one is when the MC Drag Queen does a rendition of Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" as the vulnerable choreography of a lonely woman drinking herself away (and tearing off her clothes) in angst.\r\n\r\nThe dancers are very friendly and encourage the audience to go crazy without being too insane.  \r\n\r\nThe food tastes very good.  There are Thai, chinese, and Vietnamese variational dishes that are all quite good.\r\n\r\nYou leave the place with a gentle buzz.  As a guy, you're careful not to get too drunk in this place out of the fear of one's inner beer logic into deducing some kind of flirtatious wild night with a drag queen as a viable \"courtship option.\"\r\n\r\nSo, everyone leaves happy in the end *pun accidental*.  I left Asia SF feeling content, like I had just walked out of the theatre having watched \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and actually \"got it.\"\r\n\r\nThe interior is darkly lit.  It has that dark red light vibe to it.  It reminds me of the discoteque in Saturday Night Fever.\r\n\r\nThe crowd juxtaposition of bachelorette parties, yuppies, friends, softball teams, and birthday parties creates a vibe that leaves one doubting hilariously the seriousness of Western Civilization.\r\n\r\nWho needs humanity when you have AsiaSF?  If you cannot control your drinking, make sure you have some designated \"trans\"-portation available.", "author": "Tony U."}

The dessert was a selection of small ice cream cones that were supposedly different flavors, but all ended up tasting the same. \n\nI say, props to the business owner for fully taking advantage of all of the SF tourists who don't know any better and have never seen a tranny before.

People who reside in the bay area know that SF is a poopoo platter of sexuality and gender. Since I have lived in this area for the past eleven years, transsexuals are no new news to me. The only time I went or  would go to a place like this is If one of my closest friends have a party and im invited. I have been to Asiasf Twice and have been disappointed both time. This place is fascinating to someone who might have come to a city like Sf for the first time lets say from duboise Wyoming, but if u a bay area Native and u wanna try it...I suggest watching their youtube videos and saving your 100/person tab for cramped place, super overpriced meal with mediocre taste and entree size that could feed only  a bird! \n    Lets start with the decor and Ambiance. Its nothing better than some run down mediocre grade about to shut down strip joint. The place is super loud with howls and screams of really annoying bachelorettes. The Stage is not actually a stage but just a go around walkways where the so called \"transgender showstoppers\" just walk around and wiggle their waists. Our waitress was a stuck up Latina with absolutely no service skills. My second trip was for a friends birthday and two of the attending guests were actually performers at Asiasf but were off that day and suggested they should go there for dinner so that they can get their employee Discount. Last thing I wanna do is spend my birthday at my workplace. ANywayz i had to go since thats the final verdict was. We all ordered food which was super boring and absolutely cold. We all had one cocktail each and saw the same ol run down beyonce numbers with trannies jumping up and down or trolling around a chair finishing their performance by grabbing some uncomfortable dude from the audience and smothering his face with their Breast .....TADA!!!!!! HERE WAS YOUR AMAZING ASIASF EXPERIENCE!.... comes the time to pay the bill....and let me remind u the bill was after the \"employee discount\"...it was $1100+  we were a group of ten. I can think of spending my 100 bux in so much better ways. Yes the girls are beautiful but no the performances are mediocre at best HOWEVER i think if given a proper stage their talents can really shine through!  \\...so my advise, save your money and go to some other Good restaurant and go to a nightclub afterwards ....You will be better off....", "author": "Sarah M."}

I don't know what I was expecting but a room as small as that was not what I had anticipated at all. The room was stuffy and hot and the tables were practically sitting on top of one another. The seating arrangements were awkward considering if you have a large group half of them will have to turn around on stools to see the so called \"show.\"\n\nFor the price they charge I was expecting decent entertainment. The Ladies of Sf were beautiful but I wanted to see more of a performance. The best part of the show was the last 15 minutes when they all come out and lip-sync to popular tunes but they should have done more throughout dinner. I definitely think the show aspect of the night could have been a lot better. \n\nOn a positive note the food was good. I LOVED the dessert, however some girls felt that they did not get enough food throughout the meal. \n\nThe club downstairs is just a small basement and it tends to get really crowded. We barely spent any time down there at all.\n\nThe bathroom are disgusting! \n\nMaybe I'm just picky because our group consisted of 30 somethings and our tastes are not what they used to be, but I would not recommend this venue if you want a sophisticated nice evening out with the ladies.\n\nOverall, I regret taking my best friend there for her bachelorette party and it retrospect I would have rather paid the same amount to go to a nice dinner.", "author": "Robin B."}

After all it was voted \"One of the top ten must do things in San Francisco.\" by \"MSN City Search\" and  \"One of the 50 best drinking spots coast-to-coast.\" by \"InStyle Magazine.\"\n\n*Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday $44.95/person,\n   Friday and Saturday $49/person\n\nThe Food: I came here with really no high expectations for dinner, I mean you are here for the ladies, not the food. At $49/person for a show and dinner,I expected a good show and maybe mediocre tasting food at best. However the food was quite decent, the portions were fair size; there was a first course, second/main course, and \"of COURSE\", a very delicious dessert.  I tried the grilled shrimp & herb salad, the asia-dilla, sansho spiced filet mignon, and the pineapple cheesecake. They were all very delicious with the exception of the herb salad, I felt like I was eating straight cilantro, the shrimp was quite delicious as I cleared the salad of it. The asia-dilla was very tasty and flavorful, and the filet mignon was sliced, tender and better than most.  After dinner was time for dessert, the pineapple cheesecake was a piece of heaven, with a graham cracker crust, topped with delicious pineapple, swimming in a bed of strawberry sauce, and surrounded by pieces of fresh raspberries and blackberries, a great way to end the meal, and a great night.\n\nFirst Course: \nYour choice of; tamarind chicken satays, porcupines, asia-dilla, ahi burger, sesame steak salad, grilled shrimp & herb salad, blackened tuna sashimi, or sake steamed mussels.\n\nSecond Course:\nYour choice of; orange lamb (or tofu), miso glazed king salmon, dungeness crabcakes, \"baby got back\" ribs, sansho spiced filet mignon, or truffled soba noodles.\n\nDessert: \nYour choice of; arm chocolate cake, candied ginger rice pudding, banana beignet split, pineapple cheesecake, trio of miniature ice cream cones, or dessert drinks:\nJust Desserts Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e Cream Liqueur\nJust Desserts Thin Mint Chocolate Cookie Cream Liqueur\nJust Desserts Chocolate Chip Cookie Cream Liqueur\nFonseca Tawny Port from Portugal\nBV, Muscat de Beaulieu, Napa Valley\n\nThe show was even more enjoyable, these girls can break it down, and in heels on top of that (I know a lot of women who can't even WALK in heels, let alone dance in them!!). The atmosphere was electric as the crowd was very much into it, each performance kept you wanting more and more. The location is kind of small, but that works, because it created a more intimate and enjoyable environment. The bartenders and management were really hospitable and enjoyable, sitting at the bar I got to interact with them more and was given some shots from the bartender and manager for our birthday celebration, free shots!!! Always down for that. I left AsiaSF with a full, happy stomach, a slight buzz, and my jaw dropped, I mean this when I say it, I will definitely be back for more. \n\nReservations are easy, can be made by calling (415) 255-2742, booking via the www.asiaSF.com website, or on opentable. Just be sure to book as soon as possible as they will run out of availability.......... and don't forget to dress to impress.", "author": "Tony R."}

Their bartop lip singing and dance moves are sizzling.  Table service was great.  Waiter, host, server, everyone was very attentive and patient.  We were a party of almost 20 people.  People were talking all at the same time to the waitresses and host.  And they understood us all.  The atmosphere is wild and fun.  You might get a few shocking moments, but you'll get caught up in the craziness.\n\nThe ATMOSPHERE and EXPERIENCE is worth coming here at least once!!  Great place for Birthdays and event dinners.  You can continue drinking at the lounge downstairs. So it's very convenient.  My voice is barely coming back from hooting and hollaring this weekend. \n\n\nTHE BAD\nThe food was just OK and the portions were small.  The portions got divided too small.  We had a 2 x 3 salmon that had to be shared between 4-5 people.  It was one the of few things that was good.  There was no grilled shrimp on the grilled shrimp salad.  The plates were hit and miss; it ranged from MEH to AM-I-A-FAN-?-NO-JUST-A-OK.\n\nMe: Hey what is this suppose to be? All I can taste is green onion or something\nFriend: I think that's the grilled shrimp & herb salad.  Wait! I didnt' get any shrimp?!!!\nMe: Oh is that what I ate.  There was like two small pieces of something on the side, but it wasn't 'grilled' and it didn't really tasted or looked like shrimp.\n\nTwo dinky pieces of something on a bed of green onion and cilantro split between 4-5 people; everyone only had a nibble.  Soba noodles were sour; no one ate it.  Quesadilla was good, but I did not taste duck.  The ice cream was cute and yummy.  The seared tuna was ok.  Pork ribs were ok. \n\nI think when they told us it was Family Style, I was expecting bigger portions.  I would consider it more like TAPAS.\n\nTHE UGLY\nIt ended up to be pretty pricey.  Bill + 9.75% Tax + 20% tip + 4% Health Fees.  It added up, especially since we ordered a drinks on top of the dinner.  And everyone was still hungry afterwards.  This place should be saved for a special event :)\n\nMaybe ordering a la cart would have been a better idea, but I don't think you can do that with a large party.", "author": "Theary K."}

It takes more than a lot of weave tossing, tired music & uninspired routines to impress me, I suppose (tho they do score points for working the bar top in those heels). \n\nThe performers are also your servers/hosts and, while they are personable, the social awkwardness is a constant reminder that they're only in it for the $$$. It ain't cheap either. The food is nothing you couldn't get at Elephant Bar, and the drinks are, well... pathetic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-15", "description": "Before our party arrived, we knew we were going to be spending about $100 per person, given the 20% service charge and 4%+ health charge that their website warns you about. We also went with the expectation that we were paying for a show, and not for the food.\n\nI was wrong about the food. It is pricy, but very good fusion Asian. We had the platinum menu (about 10 courses served family-style). In deference to my vegetarian friends, I did not partake of some of the dishes (the porcupine, the salmon, and the bok choy). I did love the baby-back ribs. If I liked lamb more, I would have loved it; still getting used to the taste. I liked that they offered ube ice cream -- ube is a purple yam that Filipinos make all sorts of purple-colored desserts out of. They also had coconut and other flavored ice creams. In addition to the ice cream, they also had banana beignets (think deep-fried bananas in a won-ton-like wrapper). Those were good, especially with the choice of butterscotch or chocolate sauces.\n\nCan't say much for the wine list, but friends had several of them each. I did try one of their signature drinks -- Trina's Pussycat. The fact that a usually teetotaler like me can drink it means it must be watered down. I even had one of their shots of something later on and that was weak. Delicious, but weak. I forgot to warn my friends that because of our party's occasion, we would be charged for them when they unexpectedly showed up at our table.\n\nThe performances were fantastic. The illusionists were lip-synching to raunchy music in cute outfits while strutting along the entire length of the bar. All the women raved about how great these perfomers looked. The fellow Yelpers who said these women had perfect makeup on were correct. The men at our table received (or gave?) \"Blowjobs\" -- when the performer places a shot glass between her legs and encourages the guest to take the glass from her, bend your head back, and take in the shot all at once. There were about 2 sets of performances, each with 3 performers during a number (approximately 20 minutes' worth total with 6 performers, spaced out during our time there).\n\nThe dance club downstairs was small and warm. Luckily, they have a couple of fans going. In between being able to dance to music videos, there would be a performance of a dancer giving a lap dance of sorts to a guest led to a chair. The guest is usually the bride-to-be or a birthday gal. \n\nFree coat check (but do remember to tip them) in the dance club area. The bar is also located in this downstairs area.\n\nThe bathrooms are tiny and cramped. The ones downstairs has one for women only (with 2 stalls) and another for both men and women. I did not go into that one, so I can't say how many stalls there were. I believe there is another set of bathrooms upstairs on the main dining room floor.\n\nThe place was packed when we were there on a Saturday night. Many, many bachelorette parties going on. The staff was just so friendly and accommodating.\n\nDefinitely a place to experience in San Francisco. Yes, it's pricy, but if you go in thinking you're paying for entertainment, it is really no different than some concerts or plays. It is a place to *splurge*.\n\nI highly suggest that you do *not* bring any of your friends who like to complain about prices or who don't believe in tipping. You'll never hear the end of it, and they would probably embarrass you when they try to argue the bill later. Luckily, that did not happen in my case last night.", "author": "Ruiqiu K."}

Without a doubt, these men were SUPER HOT, but the performances wasn't exactly breath - taking. We came here on a Wednesday night so we were only required to make a minimum $25 purchase but out waitress kept pushing us for the $35 menage trios so we settled for that since I really wanted to try the ice cream that yelpers have been suggesting. Our appetizers were the sake steamed mussel (mediocre), blackened tuna sashimi (nothing to praise about), grilled shrimp and herb salad (must - try), and the ahi tuna burger (too much vinaigrette , don't get!) As for our main entree, we got the orange lamb, which tasted like any other braised meat to me with no distinctive flavoring to it. The crab cake was just average. One of our friends chose the soba noodles with truffle oil which was terrible and we ended up tossing away 3/4 of the plate. The salmon was probably the best choice and even came with black glutinous rice which made it a unique pairing. As for dessert, the miniature ice cream cone were really good especially the coconut flavored one. The drinks had so little alcohol, but I figured they did it on purpose so we would keep ordering more. We tried the lychee breeze, razzle dazzle, pussy cat, kiss, sex kitten .... which were all overwhelmingly sweet and lacked alcohol. Our bill came out to be 366.52 since gratuity was $75 already, but waitress kept telling me as I was signing the receipt to add tips for the performances...

We had a section downstairs reserved for us with couches and a pole, and being that I am a pole fitness instructor, this was a complete surprise and added bonus!  We had food brought to our area and was given a round of drinks.  Also included in the price we paid for was a lap dance from one of the ladies of Asia....AMAZING! My sister was brought up on the stage and given a lap dance that was so much fun to watch, not to mention the lady of Asia was absolutely stunning. \n\nOur host at the establishment was also amazing and so very helpful.  He was lots of fun and gave us a \"Bachelorette Scavenger Hunt\" to do for that night...needless to say we got most everything checked off.  \n\nI wouldn't say that it was an inexpensive night, but for a big event, like a birthday or bachelorette (there was a handful of bachelorette groups there that night), it's completely worth it to plan the evening ahead of time (I contacted them 4 months in advance...a tad overkill...but you get the idea) in order to get a great spot and all the added fun.  \n\nThis is a place I would love to go again when in the San Francisco area.

I recalled it being better in the past, but it's still better than most other fusion restaurants.  Each time I've gone, I've done the platinum feast for birthdays, and this way we can taste everything and do it family style.\n\nWe started with the blackened tuna sashimi, which was my favorite.  It's tender in the center and fresh, with a nice herbed crust that was just slightly peppery.  The Asia-dillas were good as usual, and the sundried cherry creme fraiche was a nice complement to the duck, but make sure you eat this warm.  The tamarind chicken satays are like any other chicken satay - done well, moist, chicken breast meat, with your standard peanut sauce.  The baby bok choy and shiitakes weren't too special, and they tasted like any other Chinese stir fry.  The grilled shrimp and herb salad was a nice cilantro salad with a sour vinaigrette with a nice kick.  I loved the crisped coconut and chopped peanuts, which added a nice crunch, but the shrimp was a bit overdone.\n\nOn to \"second courses.\"  Usually, I'm not a fan of lamb at all, but I always love their orange lamb.  The sauce is so good with rice and the taro chips, and I love the cucumber salad with it.  The miso glazed salmon has a subtle miso glaze, and it was cooked jst right.  The truffled soba noodles were a bit too oily this time, but I love the truffle scent and mushrooms and asparagus.  The ribs were pretty standard, nothing spectacular - just your usual honey tamarind glaze, but I couldn't taste the tamarind.\n\nAs for dessert, I loved the banana beignets with chocolate and butterscotch dipping sauces.  The banana beignets are crunchy on the outside, smooth/sweet inside, like a halved banana lumpia.  For the ice cream cones, the taro (purple) is my favorite; the other flavors are coconut and lychee.\n\nThe highlights are the performances (they are quite hot..) and birthday shots.  Girls take shots either from the chest, or between the legs (crotch shots).  They have lots of fruity cocktails, of which my favorites were the Jackie's razzledazzle and the sake cosmo.\n\nAfterwards, you can go downstairs, where there's a bar, a DJ, and a stripper pole.  It's pretty much all the diners from your sitting that go down there, but the music was good, and the bartenders are fun and let us do our own \"crotch shots\" among friends.\n\nParking isn't too bad, and it's pretty close to 101.  The area is a bit shady, and meter is free after 6pm (but $3/hour before that).  My only other complaint is that there are only 2 bathroom stalls.\n\nIt'll probably cost $70-100 per person with drinks, but it's a very unique experience.  Even though I've gone so many times, it's always fun with a big group, and the food is pretty good for a performance venue.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

We had heard such great reviews, so we had to check it out for ourselves.\n\nWe had a dinner reservation at 7:00pm, a little early, but none the less we were still super excited. I had some idea of what asiaSF was all about, but my friends were a little nervous.\n\nAs we walked in the door, we were greeted and escorted to our seats. We were told we were being seated in a great section for the show. I was super excited at this point.\n\nSo after being seated, and reviewing the menu, we were thrilled to know that this was a three course type dinner. We hoped that the food tasted as good as it was described on the menu. \n\nAfter ordering, and getting our first round of drinks we were anxious for the show to start. The first course came out, and let me tell you the mahi mahi burger was to die for, and the portion size for being a first course was rather large.  I thought to myself, if the first course is this good, the main course can only get better. Well the main course didn't dissapoint. The glazed salmon was amazing, so fresh. The bed of tomatos and some type of cous cous was to die for. \n\nThe first show was about to start and we had just got our main course. The girls here are amazing!!! They are so good :) and they are all beautiful! after a round of lady gaga and some bumpin and grinding on the poles, we couldnt wait to plan our next girls night out!\n\nBlow job shots were offered and woooo was that an experence in itself. As one of the women sat on the counter, she waited for someone to take the bj shot. Once approached, she grrabbed the girls hair, and gave her a little show! It was so funny! and the pictures are worth a 1000 laughs. Its something my friends and I will always remember!\n\nP.S.- dessert was to die for!

Because of traffic and our detour to Sophie's Crepe's prior to this, we were running a little late and called several times to ask if we could push back or reservations. No problemo.  Then we arrived and were seated immediately. Our servers came and discussed the price fixe menu which was obligatory for Saturday evening.  Dinner was $38 and that included an appetizer, entree and dessert.  We split the (appetizers) blackened tuna sashimi, beef salad, and chicken skewers; (entrees) and baby back ribs, salmon on black rice, and filet mignon on eggplant; (dessert) and banana beignet, warm chocolate cake and ice cream trio.  Surprisingly, the food was GREAT all around.  No complaints at all - except that the portions were a bit small.  For drinks we had a bottle of the Asian pear sake and a bottle of Gewurtztraminer.\n\nDuring dinner, the lights are dimmed and the same ladies who are your waittresses perform on the bar.  Highly entertaining and super impressive (again, these ladies dance better than I can ever aspire to dance).\n\nThe bill was completely reasonable and we had no problems or discrepancies with the billing.  We even added a performer's tip!  Afterwards, we headed downstairs to the lounge for some dancing.  Bruce, our bartender, took care of us and fed us drinks all night.  After about 6 drinks, my tab was only $25! Did I read that right? Yes I did.

There is a lot of confusion around even when you go knowing that it's a up-and-coming night club in San Francisco that's hosted by cross-dressers. The waitresses of the night are not women, but transgender men. Knowing this does help, but not too much when you're there.\n\nI went with my girlfriend and her co-workers for a birthday bash/ company gathering. The place was packed and the ladies of the night were walking handsomely down the aisles. We took a preview of the dance floor on the bottom cellar and waited for our table to be cleared, a table for fourteen. As our pre-set meal started coming, we got ourselves comfortable by ordering drinks and making small talk. Naturally the focus was on the waitresses. For the men, it was mass confusion; for the women, it was a guilty stare of shock and envy. I mean, they have made-up faces, tone stomachs, and shaved legs - not to mention well-endowed tops. Surgery can do wonders I guess. But besides that, the food was good.\n\nOur appetizers came and a small show ensued. I guess if this was the old days, I'd describe it as \"burlesque\". I guess it's cabaret, which reminds me of the word kyaba-kura, or cabaret club for short in Japanese. I enjoyed the pre-set dinner. It was four courses with a baby-back rib entre' and a memorable lamb course. I didn't care too much for the grilled banana dessert nor the ice-cream cones in the end, but it received spectacular response from my fellow dinner mates. I think they were all still gawking at the men/women.\n\nWhen we finished our food, which came with a gigantic bill, we went down to hang out with the bachelorettes dancing and acting wild. It's one of the gimmicks for Asia SF, and they have regular bachelorette parties. I guess you feel safer getting crazy in a gay bar than a straight one. I ate, I drank, and I danced. I don't think there is much to say about the place besides to just go see it for yourself. The behavior is quite scandalous, but at the same time you're not sure if you should behave or set yourself apart. Boys will be boys I guess.", "author": "William H."}

We had never gone to anything like this and I was super excited. We had heard about this place from a tourist book. We booked our dinner for the 9:30 finale show. I didn't really know what to expect when we first walked in. We were greeted by the hostess and was asked for ID. We were seated right away at a small table, the lady on the phone had told me she'd sit us at the bar for the show. Oh well but it was still pretty good seats. We chose our food from the menu. The show started a bit after receiving our appetizer with 3 performers. After the show, I was hoping that it wasn't just that. We waited a while for our main entree and the baby back ribs were sooo good. Then the show really started with all the girls. I can't believe how beautiful they all looked, even when Brandy fell off the bar right next to me. I was so in shocked and I saw the look on her face, I knew she was in pain, but she got up and put on her smile. \n\nWhen it came to dessert time, one girl in particular was going around to all those who had birthdays or other types of celebration to do a shot either in between her thighs or like the bf did, in between her boobs.

Service was OK.  We had to remind the wait staff about our drink orders a few times because the drinks wouldn't show up.  One girl in our group ordered a lemon drop when we first sat down and after reminding the waiter/waitress a couple of times, her drink finally showed up with desert at the end of the party.  Food is so-so but I don't think anyone goes to Asia SF for the food.  We had lots of fun with the \"ladies\" of Asia SF and they were really great to the birthday girls who had to take blow job shots off one of the them.  The show is totally entertaining-I didn't want to go to the restroom because I didn't want to miss anything!\n\nOverall, our group had a great time...until the drink bill came (it was weird that the drink bill and food bill were separate, but whatever).  Anyway, our drink bill was just about $300.  This was kind of a surprise to us because (1) a few people didn't drink at all, (2) those who did drink had no more than 2 drinks each, (3) drinks are $10.  We did a quick inventory of who drank what and found that there were 7 or 8 extra drinks on the bill that we didn't order or receive.  It looked like they added one or 2 extra of each type of drink we ordered.  We told our server and she/he got the manager.  The manager comes over a good 15 minutes later and we explain that maybe when we had to remind the server that we hadn't received our drinks yet, they were getting rung up as new orders.  He told us that's not possible because he monitors every drink that leaves the bar and that he knows those drinks were brought to us.  Riiiiiight.  We said that maybe the servers took them to the wrong table because we didn't order nor did we get that many drinks.  He was a jerk--he kept telling us we're wrong because he knows those drinks were brought to us.  It's probably important to mention that we had not seen this guy the entire night, so I don't know how could have been monitoring the servers so closely.  It's probably important to also mention that our group was completely coherent, we were not drunk whatsoever, so it should have been obvious that we were not trying to get free drinks.  Anyway, jerk-manager had major attitude about having to adjust the bill (I can understand why he was so reluctant to adjust the bill because it took him forever-the entire place was empty and the floor was being swept while we were waiting).  And he never apologized or acknowledged that maybe the drinks he supposedly saw were for a different table.\n\nI am pretty sure this place counts on their big parties getting drunk and not noticing they're being overcharged on the bill.

We did the Dine About Menu which is  about $32 a person which would have been a good deal if they did not QUADRUPLE CHARGE US without our consent. Dinner came to $400 with all the charges which was fine -no problem. Since we were a couple of three, we all split the charges. We knew something was odd when I was charged $120 and the other two charges were $100 each -which did not end up to be $400. We talked to one of servers who instructed us just to include extra on the tip so our entire total would amount to $400. \n\nNext day my friend looked up her credit card charges and they charged her an extra $100. So I decided to look up my charges as well and they charged me $400 -even though I signed a credit card receipt that clearly stated \"$120\".\n\nUpdate: It took me one phone call mentioning \"dispute\" to get it off my credit card statement. It took my friend two days and multiple phone calls to get her off card. If you search \"bill, wrong, mistake\" it will come up that other individuals have also reported theft here.

Yelpers gave AsiaSF 4 stars avg? \n\nHad a bachelorette's party here last weekend and everyone in our group was very disappointed.  Granted we showed up 15 mins late, that doesn't give them any excuse to not give us enough food nor give us enough drinks...in short, to not give us what we paid for.  It should have been a big red flag when they asked us to pay in full first before they even 'served' us the full \"Sin-sation\" package.  These people do not deserve not a single penny for tip!\n\nFor total $660, 11 people-  about $60 per person with tax and tip, we got 9 sticks of chicken skewer, 4 small plates of bland quesadilla, 2 plates of \"Ahi\" burgers that tasted like tofu, and 2 plates of 'porcupines'.  Mind you, these all came in little appetizer plates.  And. There. Were. 11. Of. Us.  \n\nThe package came with two rounds of cocktails.  First round came and the server brought in \"cosmo\" in what appeared to be a pitcher.  The first few plastic cups were filled up to three quarters full, and upon realizing that there wouldn't be enough for 11, the server filled up the cup HALF full for the rest of those who didn't have their drinks yet.  3/4 full.  And Half full.  Can you get any more tackier than this?\n\nThe 'entertainer' came and put on a show for us in our semi-private room.  Sure, he did try.  He was game.  Sure we screamed and laughed.  And appeared to have a good time.  But when we ask why the show seemed shorter than the 30 minutes we paid for, his reply was, \"you were late\".  How about you were ugly?  Can we get our full money back?  \n\nAfter this we were about ready to leave.  But since we haven't been served our second round of drinks, and for the fortune we paid for, we lingered a little bit in the room (about 10 mins) but was already getting kicked out because the next group was coming in.  So, no drinks, no service and moving to the dance floor.  We waited for another 10 mins- still no drinks.  The whole group went upstairs to talk to the server again and for the nth time asked, \"where are our effing drinks?!\" ...nicely of course. After all, we were bunch of good looking, demure and sophisticated professionals dressed in our sexy and classy cocktail dresses that night. Mr. Server apologized and gave us bullshit excuse of being busy and whatever other reason hence, no drinks. And as we wait for another 10 mins at the \"dining area\", we were constantly getting kicked out or asked to move by other servers because the area is \"reserved\".  Seriousfknly, if we didn't have to wait that long- we would've been gone half an hour ago and out of your \"ripping off\" ways!  \n\nSo half an hour later, the drinks came - now in smaller, just a tad bit bigger than a shot glass sized, plastic cup. I'm very lightweight when it comes to drinking so I know there's hardly any alcohol mixed in that sweet concoction of theirs.  Even to the last moment, no apologies, no shame...we were just getting ripped off.  We came in to this place hungry for food and hungry for a good time, we left angry.  \n\nNot coming back.  Never.  Should you readers decide I'm just hating, and you still want to experience this place for yourself- make sure you speak with the server and have him/her tell you EXACTLY what you are paying for and check your receipt.  DON'T PAY IN ADVANCE until you get everything...and DON'T PAY TIP, unless it's deserved.", "author": "Margi E."}

I was a bit turned off when we arrived, aside from that we didn't know what name my friend put the reservation under, and we got there first, but then I saw her name on their list...but anyhow, the place is on the small side, and we were shown to a raised up table against a wall, with stools to sit on. Eesh - not my cup of tea for comfort, since I have back issues. We ordered some cocktails while waiting for our friends, and the servers kept asking if we wanted to order, but we wanted to wait for them to arrive. We wound up with a real guy serving us, not a transgender girl, and it seemed that the party tables had all the fun there. I didn't expect it to be so loud and party like, we are used to quieter places, but we over 45 too, so maybe we just don't fit in here and we are boring people. My friend and her fiance are in their 30's, so it is more to her liking than mine. \n\n    Ok, we thought the food was ok, but nothing special really. I had the vegetarian items: asia-dillas - was very average but edible, orange tofu - too spicy on the sauce for my taste, the rice was good, and then I had the banana split for dessert - yummy and cute. Others had mussels, beefy skewers, fish, and pineapple cheesecake. They all seemed content with their food, but my hubby said later that it was just ok and we agree that it's not worth the high prices. We each had a Bloomspot coupon, so that helped, but still it can add up fast! They must make a fortune on the drinks, and they joke about it, as far as they look better to you (the dancers).\n\n   We enjoyed the shows, we saw two show sets. The dancing \"girls\" were quite impressive, some more than others. We can't get over how much they look like actual women! Some are very good dancers and look sexy in their costumes.

Fun fun fun- we had the BEST time that night. We had a reserved a table for the 6 of us right next to the central bar, which doubles as a stage & catwalk. The dinner menu was prix fixe, which worked out perfectly. No one had to bother with looking at menus, and the food just kept coming. Small asian-fusion type dishes, most of which were tasty, but I'll be honest- I was a few deep by the time we ate so I can't be the best judge of quality. I DO remember the dessert though (not sure what banana beignets have to do with asian fusion, but whatever they were good). The show itself was everything you'd want from a good drag show: long leggy drag queen goddesses shakin' what mama didn't give em.. Some of those ladies, holy bejeezus, curves for DAYS. A co-worker recently asked me if this place is kid-appropriate. Welll, its a bar so no, but to further emphasize this point, as a bachelorette I was obliged to take one or two hands-free shots straight from a queen's surprisingly realistic bosom.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-20", "description": "My partner and I decided that this would be our big \"fancy pants\" dinner while in San Francisco and were very excited.  You would think, based on their website photos, that this would be a swanky place to dine while being entertained.  We were both thinking something on the order of Boom Noodle decor with transexual waitresses . \n\nWell, it's not. It's pretty much a run-of-the-mill somewhat divey and cramped gay bar with a basement dancefloor in a sketchy SOMA district neighborhood sprinkled with fancy dazzle camoflauge to disguise this fact. However it works in its favor since the \"gender illusionist\" servers are also decked out in dazzle camoflauge to disguise the fact that they were once men.\n\nThey encourage large groups (weirdly enough the majority of which were bachelorette parties), lots of drinking, and rowdy behavior. If there are less than five of you you will be seated at the bar which has it's advantages and disadvantages. \n\nThe advantage is you will literally have a  front row seat to the show. The disadvantage is you will not be served by a performer. Your server will be the bartender. Our bartender was very attentive and poured a stiff drink so no complaints there. And the drinks are named after the performers so it's kind of fun sipping a lady's cocktail as she's performing (assuming that these really are their drinks of choice).\n\nFood wise, it's exactly how they describe it on their website:  \"3 star Pan Asian cuisine\". Since there's no indication of the overall rating scale (Is it 3 out of 5? 3 out of 10? 3 out of 3?) let's just say the food was hot and good.  However, if there are less than five in your party you're required to order one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert from the prix fixe a la carte menu. \n\nAt this point my partner and I were exhausted and trashed, having arrived in San Fran at 10am that morning and going non-stop so the only thing I actually remember eating were the ribs which I mistakenly thought were boneless. At least they were fall off the bone tasty. Let's just say I was a sloppy mess afterward but I didn't feel too bad because the woman sitting next to me ordered some as well and was a bigger mess than me. We actually bonded over this fact and then she asked me what was the difference between a tranny and a transexual which made for an interestingly humorous conversation.\n\nI also ordered the \"porcupines\" and the warm chocolate cake but again, I don't remember eating them but I imagine they were delicious since I cleaned my plate.\n\nAt the top of the hour you are treated to a performance by 2-3 performers. The performers are not the best in world and in fact most of them barely even attempt to lip sync along with the music. It's more of a:  \"Look at me dance back and forth on the red stage. Oh yeah, I forgot! I should mouth a few lines to the music.\"  Nonetheless it's still entertaining. \n\nWe watched a couple of performers mocking the performer on stage unbeknownst to her so that was a hoot and makes me wonder how much cattiness goes on around here.  Also, in one of the back booths were  two smarmy old white dudes who were either the owners or the backers or something. The ladies all paid them enormous amounts of attention at different points in the evening.  It reeked of those old school 70s made for TV movies about runway girls getting caught up in the seedy underbelly of the streets. It was also another source of unintentional entertainment.\n\nReally the best performer of all was the hostess. She was like Divine's younger, prettier sister or something and when she sang \"It's Raining Men\" and ripped off her dress to reveal a Superwoman costume underneath the crowd went through the roof. You can also leave a tip on your bill for your favorite performer but we found it hard to remember all of their names.\n\nAsia SF opened up months after I left San Fran to move to the Pac Northwest so for the past 12 years I've been dying to go. I was not disappointed. It was a fun time with good service and an atmosphere that works in its favor but next time I'll make sure there's a large group of us to get the full on experience. \n\nAlso, it's a bit expensive but not fancy as we initially thought. We were a bit disappointed in that regard and decided to re-try the fancy dinner thing again at Alioto's the next night (Big mistake. See my review for that place too).\n\nOverall a 4 star adventure.

First of all, short 'n snippy little Asian dude at the front made sure to warn us we have a 1 hour 45 minute time limit.  Quite annoying to have this shoved down your throat as soon as you enter the door.  We already knew this from making the reservation.  Our table wasn't even ready though and we were seated 20 minutes late.  Our waitress was a ghoulish fiend who looked like an Addams Family reject.  She was the picture of misery.  I was sad that some of my friends who had never been there before couldn't enjoy the playful flirtations of the more flamboyant servers.    \n\nIn the middle of eating dessert, short 'n snippy little Asian dude interrupts us to remind us once again of the time limit.  Inbetween mouthfuls of Banana Beignet, I tell him that we're still eating and we were also seated 20 minutes late.  He snootily repeats over and over again, \"Ma'am.  Ma'am.  MA'AM!  There is a 1 hour and 45 minute time limit.  We have another party that needs this table.\"  \n\nSo they insisted on cutting our meal short and cheating us out of 20 minutes.  While our group was trying to settle the bill, short 'n snippy little Asian dude kept checking up on us.  Glaring with all his beady-eyed might every time he walked by.  We were being stalked and harassed by a prissy little queen!  You would think that a party that dropped over $1000 on dinner would not be pressured to leave and kicked out in such a rude rush.  But they're all about churning the bodies in 'n out.  \n\nThere was also not enough food for everybody using the Platinum large party menu.  Unacceptable.  The only reason to go back is for the entertainment...maybe to amuse some out-of-town guests.  My absolute favorite is Trina with her pussycat song.  Such a sweetie.

They aim to please and do it very, very, very well!\n\nFirst off, I had a reservation that I was enormously late for and they had already given it away.  Secondly, the place was super crowded.   My friend and I decided to go anyways to see if we might be able to get in.   Weren't able to get in but Joseph, the super sweet bouncer pointed us to a side door and said we should enjoy the downstairs club.  So we headed that way, however after going in, curiousity piqued and we kind of hung around the back to try and catch the show.  \n\nThat's when Carlos at the bar saw us and asked if we had a table, we explained our situation (expecting to be pointed back downstairs) when he said let me see what I can do.   Then another security guard named Greg (incredibly nice guy) saw us and asked if we had a table and he took off to see if he could help Carlos.  Then the Manager came out and was apologetic and said that they were making room for us.  You should remember WE were the ones that were LATE  And this great group of people were bending over backwards to accomodate us.\n\nSo in short, what do I have to say....the food was oh so fabulous and we had a very late dinner..the show, was INCREDIBLE!  Very beautiful and talented \"women.\"   They may have been men at one point but these ladies were true women in every sense.  And to everyone that works there, thank you so much for being so generous and helpful.

Duck quesadillas, orange lamb, baby bok choy & shiitakes, truffled soba noodles.  Yum.  It's all good.  And the cocktails are quite good as well.  It gets a little pricy when you start going crazy but just think of that as a cover charge for the show your server's gonna put on in a few minutes.  And those server/performers are actually very good servers - attentive, opinionated and very funny. \n\nI love bringing out of towners here.  A little while ago, I brought a group of fairly stuffy people visiting from Dublin (that's Ireland, not the East Bay).  They had such a great time flirting with the servers and making off-color jokes that some declared a desire to emigrate.  Try it.  The stuffier the visitor, the better candidate they are for AsiaSF.  They will discover a side of themselves - an openness - they never knew they had.  San Francisco can be very freeing like that.  \n\nHonestly, this place is a great answer to the question:  \"Where should I take Aunt Betty and Uncle Bill who are visiting from Toledo?  They are staying at the Wharf, but I want them to really get a feel for the city.\"  Bring them here, but don't give them any advance warning.  And halfway through the evening, lean over to Uncle Bill and whisper to him, \"See if you can find the Adam's Apple.\" \n \nIsn't the cultural diversity of a place like this a big reason you live here in the first place?

I digress...\n\nHaving organised my share of large group dinners, I was pleasantly surprise by how turnkey Aaron and Skip at Asia SF made it. Thank you boys!\n\nAnd to break it down...\n\nI LOVED how the price per head clearly states inclusive of tax and gratuity (many restaurants, such as one 5 blocks from here, does not and I learnt the hard way)\n\nI REALLY LIKED how Asia SF's pricing was inline (and more competitive in some respects, such as the inclusion of a show, also alcoholic drinks if you ask) with party packages offered in SF downtown area restaurants\n\nDid I mention the follow through? I REALLY, REALLY LOVED that Aaron was in regular contact with me right through to the night before the event. I am frankly disgusted by the amount of other SF restaurants that don't. \n\nI liked how attentive the floor staff was on the night, without being intrusive. They were right there when you need something (drinks, food and even basics like another water glass or extra chopsticks).\n\nI liked how everything happened like clockwork, the food and drinks were well timed and LOVED how the ladies were so fun!!! While the performances are fabulous, our group had the most fun when they're waitressing... we have a few guys at work who are a little sheltered and the ladies took full advantage of that.\n\nThe food... family style and plentiful (another pet peeve: guests leaving hungry, and this absolutely did NOT happen here!). Everything was big and full of flavour! I personally liked the Ahi Burger and the Baby Got Back Ribs. Though I  did wish there was some palette cleansing/ bland foods like steamed white rice to give some contrasts to the full flavour dishes. \n\nOverall... really, really enjoyed my experience here - from organising and on the night. Workmates, from directors through to assistants, all loved it and holiday party committee 2010 has their work already cut out for them!", "author": "Joyce L."}

Asia SF is actually very tastefully done and very entertaining, especially if you come with friends. We came in a party of 20 to celebrate a birthday and we had a blast.\n\nWhile you wait for your table to be ready, you are directed downstairs to the \"club\" portion of the venue, where you can dance, relax, grab a drink. They buzz your pager when everything is set and are shown to your seat. \n\nFood at Asia SF for groups is pre-fix. (There is an a la carte but may not make sense if you've got a crew.) You choose between 3 packages. Our group had the Platinum Group menu which had 9 items + 2 desserts for $48 pp. Note this is before the 20% gratuity and 4% health tax. And of course, doesn't include drinks. You are paying for dinner and show though.\n\nSo the layout of the evening is food and show, and more food and show. The 'ladies' double as the dancers. Super friendly sporting great bodies, and beautiful hair, guys in our group were definitely doing double takes. The sister to the emcee was especially cute.\n\nFood-wise, I was pleasantly surprised by the fusion cuisine. \n5 Appetizers - 1) Blackened Tuna Sashimi (pretty good, but had only a bite since there wasn't enough to go around), 2) Tamarind Chicken Satays (not dry which is good), 3) Asia-dilla (a duck quesadilla which was very tasty), 4) Baby Bok Choy & Shitake Mushroom (nice tender bok choy with sprinkling of mushroom), 5) Grilled Shrimp & Herb Salad (one of my favorites since the shrimp was freshly grilled and overall seasoning was a light thai sauce).\n\n4 Entrees - 1) Salmon (fish itself was typical but the red rice, tomato  and edamame it was served on gave nice texture), 2) Orange Lamb (very tender, not too gamey though I still don't like lamb in general, but was plated with sumono pickles which I love, and taro chips!),  3) Baby Back Ribs (very tasty and tender but requires eating with fingers), 4) Soba noodles (with asparagus and mushroom was ok).\n\n2 Desserts - 1) Mini ice cream cones in a variety of flavors - there were at least coconut, vanilla with nuts, ube, among others. 2) Banana Beignets, more like banana egg rolls which does come with chocolate or butterscotch dipping sauce. It was good but not excellent.\n\nHonestly what gives Asia SF a 4 star ranking is the show. The girls get up and perform on the bar, lip sync to a variety of popular songs, have a lot of fun with the choreography, and play with the audience. Among the more memorable acts was Simone who performed to Beyonce. She can really shake her booty. We were all laughing and having a great time.\n\nThe ladies will also come give blow job shots. Tucked in their ample decolletage, guys can take their shots mouth only. Lots of photo opps for sure.\n\nAnd there was good danceable music played throughout the night. The DJ did creative mixes and played all popular current tunes, upstairs and downstairs in the club.\n\nMade for a very entertaining evening. Definitely a crowd pleaser!", "author": "Cindy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-22", "description": "My friend's bachelorette party was held at AsiaSF. The only reservation we could get for 10 people on a Saturday was 5:00 p.m. So that was a bit early to start a night out, and it was sweltering hot inside the restaurant (heat wave in San Francisco, who would have guessed) and the tables were really cramped, but I sure had a blast. \n\nWe ended up with three (straight) guys with us at the so-called 'bachelorette' party, which was odd at first but in the end I'm glad we had guys with us because it made for an even better experience. Our bachelorette dutifully took a blowjob shot from our waitress and completed several of the dares, but it was just a riot to see the men in our party get hit on and be invited to join the ladies (all the waitresses would change into costumes and preform every hour) on stage during part of a dance show and have their faces smooshed into a set of very large boobs. \n\nHint to women: If you have men in your party, buy them a blowjob shot and hilarity will ensue. The look on their faces will be worth way more than the $10.\n\nLater we went to the basement club to dance. Even at 7 p.m. there was a sizable crowd, mostly composed of large groups who had just finished dinner. There were two private VIP dinner parties downstairs. I felt sorry for them, it was a FURNACE downstairs, who wants to eat when it's 90 degrees! We danced around for a bit but it was so hot that we kept having to go outside just to get fresh air. The music was fine, just predictable top-40 and hip-hop but easy to dance to, and our bachelorette received a dance on the stage from one of the beautiful dancers. \n\nCons: The bathroom situation was ridiculous. There was a men's bathroom downstairs (apparently it's just a 'sink' with ice that men can share)  and only one stall for women. I waited in line for at least 10 minutes, and when I came out people (there were at least 10 more in line) complained I took too long, WTF. I was trying to finish my business as fast as possible, no one wants to be stuck in a smelly bathroom for any longer than necessary!  \n\nAlso, the night was crazy expensive. You pay per-head for dinner; our dinner tab was $880 for 10 people, and drinks from dinner was another $300, and that doesn't include the other drinks we bought while in the downstairs club area.  There was not enough food to justify the cost (it's a set amount based on how many people you have, I thought it was all-you-can-eat).\n\n---\nOverall, what I liked most was the wonderful atmosphere and the super cool staff who made sure we had a great time. The food was pretty good and for the most part, the crowd (85% female) was laid-back and fun.\n\nAsiaSF provided us with a cool club hook-up so we ended up at Icon Lounge to finish out the night.

On average each bachelorette party has around 7 to 14 ladies in their group, times that by an average of 15 parties...well you can do the math!\n\nWhy I say its a hidden gem for single straight men is that there are always WAY MORE women there than men in the club.  That's because all the bachelorettes are there and utilize AsiaSF as a central hub for them to have dinner, get their drink, dance and party on before heading out to other clubs or some bachelorette parties end their night at AsiaSF also.  \n\nSo the party gets started early at AsiaSF on most weekends...usually at around 8:30PM or so on Fridays and around 7:30PM or so on Saturdays, depending on how many bachelorette parties they have booked for the night.  And depending on the night, the party goes on till about your normal 2AM....again with 95% all women in there!  Whether they are single or taken, that's for you to find out!\n\nSo since most straight single men think of AsiaSF as a gay club, even though its not, they naturally don't want to go there to party downstairs.  So what happens is that all these bachelorettes show up there  to have dinner, drink, watch a few lady of Asia shows, dance and then they move on to a club or go home!  \n\nWhy do they move on?  Because the ratio of women to men down at the night club is about 12 women for every 1 man.  You think I'm kidding?  Go to AsiaSF one Friday or Saturday night and you will see that I'm not joking!  Saturdays are their busy nights and that place can get packed downstairs so I suggest you arrive early, grab a drink with your friends and watch the endless groups of bachelorette parties show up all throughout the night to do one thing...dance, drink and have fun!\n\nThey have a live DJ there every weekend and the music is a mix of Top 40, Hip Hop, R&B, Dance and Old school tracks from 80's and 90's.  The crowd is a VERY nice mixed crowd with all nationalities; Caucasian, African American, Asian, Latin, and anything in between.  \n\nThe downstairs portion of AsiaSF is a 21 and over area but majority of the people there are about 24 and up I would say mostly consisting of bachelorettes and dinner guests with some club goers as well.\n\nThe venue itself is small and it gets hot in there when it gets crowded so if you're wearing a jacket to fight off the San Francisco cold weather, you won't need it inside and they also offer FREE coat check too!  I guess my only complaint as a female is the bathrooms being that they don't have enough but being a San Francisco native, that's pretty typical here in the city so there is nothing you can really do about it but wait.\n\nThey have a full bar downstairs also and they make some great drinks from my experience there.  The bartenders there are also really friendly!  The place can definitely use some remodeling and touching up but if you are there to just have dinner, drink and dance, then you will be fine.\n\nSo if you are a single heterosexual male, and looking for a place to hang out at with your single male friends with a very good guy to girl ratio, then I highly recommend AsiaSF downstairs in the nightclub area.  Saturdays the cover charge I believe is about $10 after 10PM.  I think Fridays are FREE all night but I could be wrong.  I would suggest calling them to confirm.\n\nI'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because of the bathroom situation but overall I love hanging out at AsiaSF on the weekends with my girlfriends and guy friends too!", "author": "Chloe G."}

I love me some trannies and I live in the Castro so I am always happy to see a hotty man/woman bump and grind to Beyonce, but one of the performers was so unattractive that I had to gulp down my \"Sex Kitten\" cocktail at an exceding shocking rate. \n\nThis place is fine.

Now, who out there can honestly turn down 3 Sex Kittens?  \n\nThe shows are fun and the \"girls\" are great - some are so beautiful I was questioning my own womanhood for a minute.

Unlike other restaurants I've been to for DAT, AsiaSF requires that everyone in your party order off of the DAT menu (which is an appetizer, entree, and dessert off of the full regular menu) if one person does. \n\nAnyway, I think AsiaSF is worth visiting once for the unique entertainment but probably not again because the food is pretty average.  Following the suggestions here on Yelp, I ordered the mussels which were plentiful and tasty.  Here's a tip, though: make sure to distribute the broth evenly amongst the mussels.  The mussels I had from the top of the heap were pretty bland, while the ones soaking in the broth at the bottom were amazingly flavorful.  My salmon entree was a bit disappointing.  I think that the salmon may have been slightly overcooked, but what bothered me more is that the miso glaze just didn't go well with the salsa (but then again, I don't really enjoy tomatoes in East Asian food).  For dessert, my friend and I shared the banana beignet split which was good but not extraordinary (although I have to admit it's hard for me to imagine an extraordinary banana split).\n\nWe sat at one of the tall tables; the seats were a little uncomfortable, but our location did give us a good view of the stage.  Our waitress was a bit pushy albeit well meaning--she pretty much chose our drinks for us (The Kiss and The Pussy; we think that she picked them because she enjoyed saying the names over and over) and put in the order before we confirmed that we actually wanted  her recommendations.

The food portions are small so I made sure I ate before I went. The shows were entertaining, and the performers were all gorgeous. the reason for the low score is the restroom facilities or lack there of. Two single restrooms on the restaurant level and two on the bottom night club area and not very clean. One restroom in particular had two stalls and both were clogged. 90% of the clientele are women and everyone knows we need all bathrooms in working order.", "author": "Shirley T."}

And if you are mentioned, I will re-live my horrid experience to anyone who ever speaks your name. I made the biggest mistake of recommending that my friend spend her bachelorette party with you. I thought that my friends would be able to see the same show that I did when I first came here, where people  are amazed that men can become beautiful women. WRONG. Instead we got stuck downstairs in a club for an hour and they asked to immediately leave after $62 of tasteless appetizers that they end up throwing away. At this point, not really upset, still graciously forgiving because I'm given a long list of clubs that I'm promised that I will be able to get into. We end up choosing Roe because the bride to be loves the hip-hop top 40 and I USE TO think that Roe was a decent club that played a variety of music. WRONG AGAIN. 10 out of the 12 party is able to get inside. Being that I'm the only person in the group that lives here, I go to inquire as to why the rest of group is not getting in. I'm immediately kicked out FOR NO REASON AT ALL and not allowed to retrieve my jacket, tell my friends why I'm asked to leave, can't finish my drink, nothing. My entire group of course leaves because they feel bad for me when it is the bachelorette's night. You should feel ashamed of yourself AsiaSF and Roe! You ruined a woman's last night of freedom over nothing. After we payed you plenty of money, you were absolutely, disgustingly rude for no reason.  I am so embarrassed that I brought my friends here. I will NEVER come here again and if anyone inquires about where to go in SF, you will be the first place that I talk poorly about. And I love SF, and I love to share with my city with others but you have tarnished my reputation. And as you will see from my reviews, I did not sign-up on yelp to talk bad about businesses but this place should not be in business. They have made false, empty promises and do not provide what they sell to their customers.", "author": "Jennifer R."}

If you come for both, you'll almost get your money's worth.  We arrived without reservations and as an AsiaSF virgin, the guy, who seemed like a manager at the time, gave me the run down that on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, we had to order off a prix-fixe menu at $33/person.\n\nFor $33, each person has a choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  Beverages, alcoholic or not (excluding tap water), have a running tab.  We ordered the blackened tuna sashimi and a steak salad for our appetizer, crab cakes and filet mignon for our entree, and the beignet split and a muscat for dessert.  The sashimi was not the best, but the salad was decent.  The filet entree was good; the meat was tender, but was lacking in flavor.  The filet was served with potato stars, which were like french fries, and became the absolute favorite part of my meal.  I also can't complain about the beignet split, but I wasn't a fan of the muscat, which I didn't finish.\n\nAs for the entertainment...  We stayed long enough to catch 2 shows even though the manager told us we could only catch one.  They gave us an hour and 45 minutes to eat and hang out, enough time to watch just one show, but we stayed a bit longer anyway.  It didn't surprise me that most of the trans-sexual performers were Filipino.  You can find them in great abundance if you visit Boracay in the Philippines.  The show was entertaining, but I wasn't impressed by the Caucasian performer.  I'm not being biased, but I think Filipino trans-sexuals practice a bit more, especially if they came from the Philippines; they have the tendency to be more flamboyant.\n\nThe highlight of my evening?  The entertainment I got from the bartenders, Carlos and John, the server Ray (who kept bringing me more stars because I kept asking!), and a few of the servers/performers I met, like Jasmin.  Oh!  One more thing... I can't forget one of their patrons that evening.  A former employee of AsiaSF was there with an older male friend... I asked one of the bartenders if he thought the gentleman friend knew \"she\" used to work there and his response?  \"Hell no!\"", "author": "Annalynn C."}

The food was good, I'll give them that; but, for two people to spend $150 on dinner and drinks! Two people who barely drink to begin with. That's a bit pricy for me. The dancers were ehh. Nothing to rave about. They got on stage and karaoked a few routines. The routines weren't Broadway, nor were the girls. \n\nAnd the crowd! What the hell!

You pretty much know what you're getting yourself into when you go to AsiaSF.  While the food and entertainment seem to be consistently enjoyed time and time again, I also appreciated the details of the operation as well.   To start off, someone was outside to open our taxi door when we pulled up to the restaurant.  From there we went to the club/lounge/bar waiting area downstairs until our table was ready.  The personalized menus on our table were a nice touch too.  So were the blow job shots -- memories to last a lifetime!  I especially liked the fact that they sold disposable cameras because mine ran out of batteries (trust me-- you'll want to take pics so that you can continue arguing with your friends whether those puppies were real or not when you are sober the next morning!).   \n\nDespite the fact that our waitress put on two sexy and hilarious shows that night, we still were showered with attention from all the servers and the host who really wouldn't leave us alone and got us a bunch of shots on the house.  The meal took about 2 1/2 hours.\n\nThe food was pretty good but it was a DAMN expensive meal, especially when I had to foot the bill for my booze guzzling friends with a 20% gratuity added.  Drinkers beware!  Also the tables were uber-cramped and the bar stools that we sat on to eat dinner were almost unbearably uncomfortable.

The night started with drinks downstairs while our party of 20 gathered.  A few brides to be were brought to the stage and had a dance with one of the staff.  We quaffed slightly over priced drinks and then headed up stairs to our table.   Our group was packed in in such a horrendously uncomfortable way that many of us ended up standing for fear that we would fall over backwards on the awkward stools.  Dish after dish was brought to our table of totally average appetizers that  must have been bought from the around the corner Costco.  As each patron or wait staff went by the customers would get pushed and jostled due to the overcrowding.\n\nThen the entertainment started.  Sure it was interesting but by no means was this the show I had heard such great things about.  I had expected a choreographed dance routine or singing but what we got were trannys just standing there shaking their asses on a bar.  I guess I've hung out at the Trannyshack too long to see this watered down and sanitized version.  It didn't help that so many of the patrons were literally staring slack jawed, whispering about where their \"packages\" were hidden.

He was there waiting for our party and walked us right in to seat us at tables by the back side where the stairs are. The place is long and narrow with a bar in the middle, tables on the outside. It was pretty packed for dinner. There were other bachelorette parties, birthdays and celebrations going on. \n\nThe dinner included the following:\nPorcupine, asiadilla, lamb, ahi tuna burger, steak salad, ribs, soba and finished with ice cream cones in exotic flavors. The meal was actually really good! I'm pretty sure it wasn't because we were all pretty happy from the pre-party and limo ride to SF. But everything was good and tasty. I would eat there again. \n\nOur server (Simone I think) was very nice and attentive and the runners were super cool. Everyone was friendly, didn't rush us with the meal and everything came pretty quickly, still hot and with no mess involved. \n\nOrdered drinks there too but I only tried the Sex Kitten which was very yummy but hardly any alcohol in it. Our server had the bachelorette take a blowjob shot which made for great pictures. \n\nWhile dinner was going on at the tables, the show goes on at the catwalk on the bar. The \"ladies\" lip sync and dance to entertain the patrons. I couldn't believe how pretty some of them were! We talked to some of them after the show and at the club downstairs and I found myself saying \"I want to be you when I grow up.\" Seriously. They were just hot! I have been to Thailand so I have seen some great looking ladyboys. \n\nAfter dinner we headed downstairs where we had VIP so we were seated in the back area by the strip pole. We made good use of the pole of course and danced and got drinks from the bar. My complaints were that the DJ repeated some songs and that there weren't too many people at this club. It was mostly the other bachelorette parties that were there. Hardly any guys, which made it hard to score free drinks. Bummer. We pretty much danced within our group and had a blast! The security was super cool and they even danced with us and for the bachelorette but kept it super professional. The spotlight dance was so funny! I learned some moves!

I think the best part of dinner was the mango ice cream at the end.\n\nHowever, the entertainment portion of our dinner was quite an attention grabber. Keep in mind that the hot 34-28-34 waitress in the corner wearing the red laced bra and fishnet leggings isn't a waitress.......she's a WAITER. ;) Don't let the short skirts and pretty makeup fool you. Before bringing out the second course, the room goes dark and the runway is eluminated with flashing lights and a \"waitress\" named Candy ready to put on her act for the evening. There's about 4-5 performances before the lights come back on and your food comes out again. Of course, they save the best gal for last!\n\nFor me, I've been there and done that. Don't think I'd return unless it was a special occasion and we had no other option. It was a fun night though, so I say try it once.", "author": "Michelle W."}

Might also want to hit the bottle before you step into Asia SF while you're at it.  Such a SF staple, everyone should check it out once (and just once, really).\n\n--------------\n\nThe performers here are HOT (some more than others), are generally more than happy to take pictures with guests, and really are pretty sweet.  There is one ultra-curvy Venezuelan girl I couldn't stop gawking at!!  She totally puts me and whatever assets I have to shame!\n\nUnfortunately, the food  here is absolutely horrendous.  First course/appetizers were slightly worse than okay.  I can't quite remember what we ordered, but it definitely wasn't memorable.  The main courses...oh god, the main courses.  The lamb was overcooked and had such a gamey taste that our party of four didn't/couldn't bother to finish it.  Crabcakes tasted very artificial and was on the saltier end.  Ribs were okay--these went first on our table.  Sashimi was...NOT sashimi or something.  It definitely didn't taste fresh and was a bit rubbery.  Dessert was the best part, probably because they didn't make it.  The beignet dish did not actually have beignets, which caused us great sadness.  I think there were pirouettes that were supposed to be beignets.  Thankfully the fresh banana half and ice cream somewhat made up for it.  The little ice cream cones were probably the best, with the beignet and chocolate cake as close seconds.  Skip the rice pudding.\n\nDrinks are on the expensive side with Goose and Belvedere at $11-12, as a reference point.  Our experience costed the same as a meal at Gary Danko's.", "author": "Dwigt K.

Both times we were required to pay per person for a fixed menu meal.  \n\nAt the bachelorette we were told, more than once and by several staff and the manager himself, that we were getting an \"all you can eat buffet dinner\" for ~$50/person including a lap dance for our guest of honor.  However, at the end of the night we were informed we'd needed to pony up over $75/person because \"we ate so much food\", yet more than half the guests were still so hungry they had to go get dinner before meeting us at the club we went to afterwards!  It was billed as a private party, but all we got were ropes dividing our portion of the dance floor full of the other 4 or 5 bachelorette parties, and stationing us as far away as possoble from the entertainment.\n\nThe 2nd time we had a reservation for 9pm and were not seated until 10:30 pm!  We were patient and friendly, but asked politely about our table at 9:45 and 10pm, but it wasn't until we asked for the manager that they sat us.

Our party of 10/11 got put downstairs for a \"private party\" and meal of appetizers because we were too big. None of us were stoked about the food. I had heard good things about their dinners though, so I have a feeling the dinners are better. My biggest problem with the food was that none of it was hot when it got to us. Or maybe when it got to my mouth.\n\nBut, you know what? Paul and Patrick (our \"host\") were super accommodating and great. My camera batteries died. Paul ran across the street and bought me some batteries (technically I bought them - but it was an \"I buy you fly\" scenario that allowed me to stay at the bachelorette party while my guests - and the bachelorette - were still arriving.) And the food kept coming until we stopped ordering. We shouldn't have stopped ordering was the thing.\n\nI also talked to Noah who was just as nice as Paul and went the extra mile to make sure we got into Ruby Skye that night.\n\nWhen it was Club Time downstairs, it got pleasantly packed and the music was a blast.

My only question for our maker is: why didn't my dancing talents carry over? \n\nLast weekend was my cousin, Linda's, bachelorette party, and part of the festivities took place at the scandalous, the amazing, and the flamboyant ASIA SF! \n\nThere are two parts to Asia SF: the dinner upstairs and the dancing downstairs. Upstairs is interesting because it features a \"gender illusionist\" show in which transsexual and transvestite performers lip sync and dance on top of a bar that graces the center of the dining room. Are the gender illusionists gorgeous? Yes. Do they have big boobs? Very. Are their moves good? Awesome. Can you tell they are/were men? Maybe a little if you're up close. But seated at my dining table and feasting away on the food, I was entranced. More on this in a moment. \n\nI wouldn't recommend Asia SF for just its food, which is on the mediocre and pricey side. Only two items elicited some excitement from me: the orange lamb with coconut jasmine rice and the miso glazed salmon. The other items I sampled were on the forgettable side: the duck quesadilla, the seared ahi tuna, the chicken satay, the baby back ribs, the grilled shrimp salad, and the truffled soba noodles.

We were sitting pretty closely with each other, but the environment was fun enough for us to sit closely with random strangers.\n\nThere was a special V-day menu where you could pick 2 starter courses, 1 main course, and 2 special V-day desserts as well as champagne were included. The fiance and I also ordered their pomogranette mojito which was very tasty. \n\nOur first starter course was their steak salad, which was pretty good but a little spicy for me. Our 2nd starter  course was absolutely delicious - 4 skewers of grilled chicken and some type of peanut sauce that you dip with.

Granted, its quite pricey and the food is good but not great, but I still feel that it was so SO worth it.  The drinks are really good--awesome patron margaritas and the pomegranate mojito was amazing.  The girls there are SO HOT man.... I went with a group of girlfriends and a straight guy friend... and we were all stunned by their amazing boobs and bums!!  WOW.  My guy friend was totally checking out their butts too!  Seriously, I don't know how they have such amazing bodies, and they had pretty faces too!!  Totally motivated me to go the gym today.  The service is amazing, and even thought it was pricey, you still felt good about giving them a great tip at the end of the night.  \n\nGreat party venue.... even saw Jay--the winner of Project Runway--there!

My boyfriend and I came here tonight for a friends birthday and we absolutely hated the entire experience.  We both believe that it is without a doubt the worst dining experience we have ever had, and that includes awkward blind dates where the other person  sneezes in your food. \n\nWe are currently at home cooking dinner after having allegedly eaten at Asia SF.  To say the food here comes in small portions is an understatement.  Though there were many courses in the meal, the courses consisted of lukewarm to cold food.  The best thing I ate was a cold chicken tender and the worst was probably the bland and terrible soba noodles.  The renowned ribs were about as delectable as a bone wrapped in beef jerky.  Overall the entire meal was ghastly.\n\nThe food and the prices aren't the only thing that serves to dissapoint about Asia SF, the service was also some of the worst service I have encountered.  Though everyone is friendly during the show, after the show they force the bill in your face and begin putting away everything but the tables as a sign its time to go.  \n\nThe dancing was interesting but became repetitive after not too long, partly due to the fact that we hadn't been properly fed.  But overall I wouldn't say that this is a redeeming quality or a reason to go under any circumstance.\n\nAlbeit the company that we went with was fantastic and we were happy to celebrate our friends birthday with her we will be passing on all other birthdays or events that involve Asia SF.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that we as well as other patrons would have had a much better experience had we all gone to a soup kitchen in the tenderloin.  \n\n If I was able to give no stars or -5 stars I would do so without regret.  Please save your money and go somewhere else.  But, if you do end up here please note that there is a Burger King across the street for when the hunger pangs kick in.", "author": "Meghan A."}

My favorites were the duck quesadillas and the cilantro salad.\n\nIn between courses were shows with dancing waitresses atop a huge bar.  They never hesitated to improv and grab some unsuspecting male's head as they walked by and rub it over some area of their bodies.  We all got a really good laugh over this, especially when our friend was made a volunteer.\n\nThe second round of drinks and food came and went.  I wasn't as impressed by the second course.

The seating was a bit tight.\n\nIt is funny to watch people who have not ben to this type of show get so excited.

We had the later seating, so when we first arrived the first show wasn't over and we were ushered downstairs to wait in the bar/club area.  We grabbed a drink and socialized for a few minutes before going back upstairs to our table.\n\nOur waitress came out and took our order, then the show began.  The dancing and entertaining was great - those are some hot girls with hot bodies!  Why do men always have the best legs?

For the amount of money you pay, you really don't get enough substance (of the culinary or entertainment variety). \nThe girls:\nThe performances were great, but really short. In the nearly 3 hours we were sitting there, the girls only perform 2 15-20 minute shows. The ladies were also very nice, but in that Hooters girl kind of way that feels not-entirely-genuine...they just want a big tip. Also, this is just a personal preference, but I like drag queens who are funny and have fabulous costumes, regardless of whether they really look like a woman or not. The ladies at Asia SF are something else entirely, they are gender illusionists, so they try as hard as possible to look like hot girls and put on a burlesque show. Impressive, sure...but in my opinion not as entertaining. \nThe food:\nAll and all, not bad, but the portions were small for the price tag. The salmon was delicious and fresh, but the \"salad\" under it was raw onion, tomato, and a few past their prime edamame with no dressing that I could taste. My friend's enjoyed the orange lamb/tofu, and the mushroom soba noodles were tasty, but the portion was tiny. The desserts were great though, the fried banana and green tea cheesecake were both top notch. \nWe went on a Wednesday night (the night where you can choose food/drinks that add up to a minimum of $25) and our bill was still nearly $300 for 6 people with all the crazy taxes and mandatory 20% tip.

They are also ALL super nice, friendly, and fun, without being overly sexual and flirty.

That's not cool!\" to which all he had to say was, \"my bad.\" I've worked in F&B before and I KNOW you want to clear everything and get the EFF out asap, but c'mon, servers don't even do that at Denny's!!!

We tried telling MULTIPLE runners/bussers and only 1 girl seemed to get the problem solved.... BUT when we finally did get our missing entrees, we only got 1 salmon & 1 lamb, for 8 people!!! We notified someone else and got 1 tofu, but I was literally still hungry (and also pissed after someone tried to take the last of our food! see above). I wish they had a bread basket or something for the table. \n\n-Related to the entree mix-up... after our noodles & baby back ribs were cleared and we were waiting for the rest of our entrees, they brought the birthday boy one of their ice cream cones w/ a candle on it... but wait, we hadn't even received all of our dinner! We told the guy, he said he'd check on it, and a few minutes later, the SAME guy brought out a stand of the mini-ice cream cones for the rest of the table. UM, we're still hungry, and we wanted our REAL food & not a tiny ice cream cone. Also, they really need to divide up the banana dessert onto 2 plates because 1 large plate + 1 long table = 1/2 of table not getting any until the bananas are cold. \n\n-The show was overall really good, but some of the girls didn't know the song they were doing AT ALL. Either have it be a dance routine, or a lip-synch, not a dance w/ someone who's trying to mouth some of the words. \n\nOverall, 4 stars. Fix the lag time & entree mix ups, & it's all good! But for the price... it should be perfect.", "author": "Kuzu K."}

I am VERY disappointed in this place.  I hosted a bachelorette party here with 14 girls last weekend; we each paid $60 a piece.  This was supposed to include a buffet dinner in a private setting and a couple other things.  \n\nWhen we arrived we got thrown downstairs into a tiny room and had a curtain as a door.  It was so dark and extremely loud.  The 14 of us barley fit in this room and we weren't even provided a table to sit at, we all had chairs that were placed in a circle.  The food was great, but I had no idea what I was eating because it was so dark, which made it a little creepy! It was also so loud that it was very hard to communicate with the guy running the show.  The website makes it seem like throughout the night you see the \"ladies\" of Asia performing...but they only appeared downstairs to give a show for the bachelorettes and that is it! \n\nAs the host I felt horrible making these girls pay this much money for going to a crappy club type setting.  We made the best of it and still had fun, I just wish it could have been a little better for the amount of $$ that we paid!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-06", "description": "Yes, it's the famous SF staple where guys come out sexually confused and girls come out thoroughly entertained.  If you're a girl reading this, you might as well give this review 5 STARS and STOP reading this right here right now and book reservations to Asia SF next Saturday.  For other more serious and like-minded folks, you may continue.\n\nI came here for a bday party and going inside the place, it has a very clubby/Coyote Ugly type of atmosphere.  This place ain't cheap for dinner and we paid $38 for the Gold Menu, but you had to come really early or late in order to get this deal (our party came at 9:45pm), otherwise the normal party menu was $65 a person.  The place isn't very spacious and they'll seat people as close as possible in order to get as many people in the audience for the shows to come.\n\nThe food was pretty average in my opinion.  There's actually quite a bit of variety that's served with nice presentation and skimpy portions.  Not the most flavorful meal around and for that money you kind of expect something a little more out of it to appease your belly.  But fortunately in most cases, you're most likely going with a group of girls, so there should be just enough food for everyone's stomach to be at least satisfied, but maybe not full.  Their specialty drinks are $10 each and they're all very fruity, and as a guy, I don't really care too much for these.  I do recommend if you want to embarrass the guy's in your group (which I don't condone) or it's your gal's bday (I do condone), is to ask the waitress for a BJ shot.  Though the 2 that were ordered at my table wasn't exactly a BJ shot and more of a Cleavage shot, but whatever and it's pretty self explanatory that I don't need to delineate on what goes on here for both cases.  And the waitresses are pretty friendly, and maybe a little more so to the guys I would say, but for more than obvious reasons.\n\nAnd of course, there's the real meat of the show (no pun intended). You paid all that money to get in here not for the food, but for the whole package (again, no pun intended) of coming out here (I guess that's no pun intended either).  You're treated to 2 shows during dinner where the ladies of Asia SF will dance on the bar counters and lip sync to such great classics like \"These Boots Are Made for Walking\", \"I Will Survive\", \"I Love Rock n Roll\", \"These Hips Don't Lie\", \"I Kissed A Girl\", and several others, all the while wearing outfits I wouldn't imagine someone of their caliber fitting into and quite well, I have to admit.  The girls in my group were hollering all night long and taking about 200 pictures each.  Truth be told, it was an entertaining performance, maybe not something I would normally pay that much to watch, but it's worth going to at least once.  And for me to say that, is the reason why I gave the number of stars for this review.  I didn't care for the food and drinks all that much (which is usually a main factor of my reviews), but if you want this experience then by all means take a gander at this famous SF venue.  It could be argued that I should be rating it on just the show, but I have to be fair with my reviews and just score it for everything as a whole.  I would say, most likely you won't come out disappointed... unless you're a hardcore conservative or just a straight foodie, then maybe you want to find another place, but I guarantee you won't find a place like this anywhere else here..", "author": "David Y."}

I guess the earlier show ran late so we had to wait. We had 10 in our group and were seated at a table that could really only fit 6-8, so let's just say we were cozy. All of the food is served family style and it was AWESOME!!!! I was so impressed with the food and had no idea it would be that good. \n\nThe performers are also the servers which I think is a little weird. The service definitely suffers because of this, plus they only actually perform for about 30 minutes of your 2 hour meal. In between waiting on the tables, however, they interact with the patrons which I guess is part of the \"show\". I was expecting the show to go on throughout the entire meal, so I was a little dissapointed.\n\nWe brought a cake for the bride to be, and even though I let the hostess and two of our servers know, they still forgot to bring it out. After dinner we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for the cake which kind of made it anticlimatic. It was served as they were shutting everything down. \n\nSo, my overall review is: go there for great food, don't expect great service. The show is really entertaining, but it might leave you wanting more.", "author": "Kandace K."}

It's tired, it's old, it's lost it's charm...which I think can also be said for the performers too. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because the cocktails were good. Now that that's out of the way...\n\nMy younger sister was in town the other week so her friend suggested we go here with a few of their friends. I was the only one who had been here before, but it had probably been at least 6 years ago. And I remember it being a fairly fun and memorable experience, so I figured what the hell? I'll try it again.\n\nWe walked in and the whole place just seemed dead and dirty. Granted, it was a Sunday night...but if this is what a Sunday night is - note to Asia SF: close on Sunday. We entered in the middle of a performance (which basically consists of one of them dancing around on a catwalk lip-syncing to whatever pop princess is at the top of the charts that week) and because there weren't many people in the audience, and everyone seemed fairly tame and sober, it was A-W-K-W-A-R-D. \n\nBut it gets worse. We sit down and are informed that we must order the prix-fixe menu with three courses for $36 or something. The price was totally reasonable - I was fine with that. It was the menu selection that sucked - out of five of us, we almost all ordered the exact same thing because hardly anything sounded good. And the thing we did order - some lamb dish - was gross. It was well-done and tasted really game-y. Yuck. The banana split that me and sis split was pretty good, but the rest of the food was 2 stars at best.\n\nSo after sitting through another awkward performance, we get the bill. They charge you 20% for the show on top of your food and drinks. And then you have to tip on top of that. And that sucks. \n\nSo when I was 22 I had a good time here. And maybe I'm just getting old now, but I think it's time to put the restaurant, the concept, and especially the performers to bed.", "author": "Kate S."}

The thing is, this is one of those places that you go to for the atmosphere and experience so I'll let it slide...\n\nThen we went downstairs to the club.  I have never experienced such an inept DJ in all my days.  Just to give you a taste:  at one point the DJ confused himself and decided to play the same song twice.  He effectively cleared the dance floor and those who remained just stopped dancing and stared at the poor guy.  When he finally cut the second go around of 'love don't cost a thing,' there was a dead silence that definitely did not help bring the vibe back.

Arrived around 9:00, the doorman said they were running 5-10 minutes late. No biggie; we headed downstairs to the lounge for cocktails and to watch the show.\n\nIt was PACKED. Like elbow room only kind of packed. And deafening. There were at least four identifiable bachelorette parties down there being, well, drunk and bachelorette-like. Great if you're into that sort of thing; for me it's a pretty good approximation of hell. \n\nThe stage for the performers is about 3\" off the ground*. With the mob, it was impossible to get much more than a glimpse of fake boob every now and then. The DJ followed up \"My Humps\" with \"Ice Ice Baby\" - I'm not sure if he was mocking us or if that really was the right mix for the crowd. \n\nAfter the four of us had finished our (mediocre, well) drinks ($28 before tip) we headed back upstairs to get some air. Our table still wasn't ready, so we waited outside ... the lounge was just not a fun place to be, tranny show or no. While we were waiting, we watched at least five more bachelorette parties arrive in all their boozy glory.\n\nAt 9:55 (forty minutes after our reservations) we finally were offered a table. Where we would have the privilege of sitting back-to-back with the occupants of the neighboring tables, shoulder-to-shoulder with each other and the wall.\n\nWe left. Won't be coming back soon.\n\nThree stars for the performers - the trannies were prettier than most of the real women there. -2 stars for the atrocious management and crowd.\n\n* EDIT: Apparently there's also a runway upstairs where the \"real show\" goes on, which is properly elevated and visible. Didn't see it when we were there. The downstairs shows, it seems, are just teasers.", "author": "Moto O."}

Great recommendation! We loved it.\n\nI went to Asia SF with my fiance. We sat at the bar like most parties of 2/3 do. The downside is that you don't have a waitress if you sit at the bar.. but that's ok, it was still fun and the ladies were still super nice about posing for pics with us and whatnot. \n\nFood: We actually really enjoyed it and found it a decent value at $35 or so each. We especially loved the duck quesadilla, the ahi tuna (surprisingly fresh), and our desserts. The drinks rocked, but we enjoy the sugary sweet martini type drinks that they serve. I found at ~$10 each they weren't that overpriced compared to what I'm used to. \n\nService: Food was quickly served, bartenders made our drinks well, and everyone was very friendly.

Be warned before you go though that AsiaSF is pricey. Even if you have a prix fixe menu (which we did through the Dine About Town promotion going on right now) you will end up spending $50 with tip and tax and then some if you get a drink (which I did because one of the drinks just sounded too good to pass up.)\n\nIf you are vegan you are probably better off ordering individual items from the menu if you can. Everyone else at my table shared something like ten dishes and I only got two. Granted they replaced the first bowl of soba noodle deliciousness on our table with two more when it was empty... I still only got to try two different dishes. Then despite the fact that our waitress told us that AsiaSF takes care of their vegans I wasn't given a dessert when everyone else was... or they just forgot I was vegan at that point since out came 6 ice cream cones for the 6 of us. When I asked for a vegan dessert (hey... the fixe prix menu included dessert so I wanted a friggin dessert) they seemed a little annoyed but said they could give me fruit. Unfortunately my fruit came out with a big pile of ice cream in the middle. Our waitress appread at this point (a busboy delivered the fruit with ice cream) and corrected the mistake telling them to just get fruit. A different bus boy came out with a bowl of fruit and basically threw it at the table with a look of disgust on his face. That seemed uncalled for. It occured to me afterwards that my meal should have cost less than everyone else's since I wasn't getting as much variety of food and my dishes had lower cost ingredients in them.  Oh well.\n\nMy dishes were fab as were those eaten by my omnivorous friends. One of them was flipping about how the salmon was the best he had EVER had. \n\nThe shows were fun and a little raunchy but not overly-the-top so, although one person from our table was pulled out of his seat by one of the performers and had his head shoved into her breasts. Things were differently a bit more wild in the nightclub downstairs where the girls performed special dances for the brides-to-be from the bachelorette parties. I wish that the staff would say that the downstairs club was included instead of free because really when I just paid $50 for my dinner (+$10 for a drink) that is how it seems. Oh... and if you only want to go to the club and skip the food part that is $10. \n\nWe just went to try the fixe prix menu because a friend visiting from LA wanted to check out the place. Normally it is frequented by people having their bachelorette parties or by people celebrating occasions such as their birthday. I was surprised by the number of brides to be out early Saturday night when we were at AsiaSF... and they all appeared to be under 30!\n\nIt was also interesting to note that most of the clientele was female. \n\nI highly doubt I will be back unless a friend is getting married and is having her bachelorette party here.

Kind of small but looked so fun. Everyone around seem like they were either tourist or from the bayarea, all straight people to me. Our waitresses were so pretty, like models.

Trinidad expressed that she was confirming reservations and that there was an opening.  Not only did Trinidad offer to take my reservation, she released the table so I could make my reservation on line to get my opentable.com points. Extremely helpful and personable! Congrats on the upcoming wedding! \n\nFood: Love it. Portions are not oversize, but do we need them to be?  Moderate portions with fresh ingredients that are nicely prepared.  I had the hearty steak salad, the tasty baby got back ribs (about 5) followed by the caramel liqueur dessert drink.  Hubby had the eggroll size porcupines, salivating salmon  (I hijacked his delicious edamame salad) and fattening warm chocolate cake (LOL).  All was DELISH!\n\nShow:  Jasmine rocked a new song for her second show! Great Job! She should put it into regular rotation.  Amber is the cutest of the latest and I wish I had that body!  I probably do, but it's hidden under an extra hundred pounds. Trina's tasteful humorous number about her Bald, Hot, P*ssy is not age appropriate for the young, but had EVERYONE in stitches. I even googled the song later.  The changes from night to night, so not sure who you'll get to see. \n\nSeating: Don't let them tell you there are bad seats.  This is a quaint swanky spot, so not much room to go wrong. The ladies WORK the runway during their show, so you can see regardless of where you sit.  \n\nExperience: AsiaSF is great. My husband of 17 years and I were simply out for dinner and the ladies heard Date Night and although we were not part of a large party we got a special 'Shot Out'!  Also I could not print out a coupon I purchased and Derrick OFFERED to research and apply my credit.  No hassle which is rare commodity.\n\nNice spot for small and large parties with a special treat for the honoree! Somewhat pricey, but worth the AsiaSF experience!!", "author": "Rochelle C."}

For one, the restaurant/show area was packed in way too tight. The tables were close together and it was hard to get around . Secondly, we were under the impression that the bachelorette menus would be served in a more private area. Instead, the performers lip synced/danced on top of the bar table.  Everything seemed chaotic and disorganized. We got served some entrees multiple times, two of the drinks were completely forgotten until we reminded the servers twice. We were also charged for five people, though there were only four of us (granted, the reservation was originally for five.)\n\nAll negatives aside, the performers/servers were super hot and very friendly. Our assistant server was especially beautiful. All the happy bachelorettes and their escorts created a very festive atmosphere. No amorous pervs in the mix since the place was comprised of 90% females. The food wasn't the greatest. Some dishes were better than others. The sweet mix drinks were fairly potent.\n\nWe went downstairs to the dance floor area after dinner. I normally disdain popular club tunes but the music was tolerable. We all enjoyed watching lap dance performances by beautiful dancers. We got our bachelorette Holly a lap dance and she really got into the spirit of things. Many good photos as remembrance of the occasion. \n\nOverall, Asia SF was a novel experience. Perv-safe and fun entertainment venue for bachelorettes.", "author": "Tif W."}

Not that it's bad, per se, actually I thought the quality was quite good, and I appreciated all the veg-friendly options  But I will also agree with other Yelp!ers that it's overpriced and the portions really do leave a lot to be desired.  However, it is a cut above typical bar food, so I was pleasantly surprised - I'm still a fan of their orange tofu and ice cream cone selection!\n\nDRINKS: There's no denying it - they're overpriced.  Cute, though.  Kind of like the ladies here - waay cute and you wonder if you can afford them.

Well then again, since I took a blow job shot between one of the waitresses' cleavage, maybe it should make me question mine as well...\nIn all seriousness though, the dance show here is awesome and it happens literally right on the bar. These ladies are so spirited and fun and yes.. SEX-XAAAY... that it's impossible not that catch the party fever and before you know it, you're singing and dancing right there on the floor with them. \nThere is a dance floor downstairs that opens after the show, but really... you MUST stay for the show... go to the show!

There was not much going on besides the loud music, except for a brief but entertaining performance on the hour.  I think they expect you to stay for two hours and see two performances because our waiter seemed shocked when we left after dessert, but really how long can dinner take?

I thought the food here was very good. It's all 'asian-fusion' type dishes, so if that's not your 'thing,' you might leave a little hungry. However, I enjoyed everything that was served. We had the Diamond menu, which included several courses and entrees, all of which I found very tasty. Some in our party were not seafood-lovers, and as many of our entrees included seafood, that could've been a bit of a problem, but the wait staff was very attentive and generous, offering additional chicken entrees, etc to our table for those that didn't want the seafood. No additional charge either. Very nice of them.\n\nThe restaurant itself was much smaller than I imagined it would be. There was a bit of a 'cramped' feeling - tables very close together, seats all very close together. When everyone was seated at the table, it was difficult for someone to get up from the table without everyone else on that side of the table having to get up and move as well to let them through.\n\nThe 'ladies' working here were very friendly and great about posing for photos, etc. They also waited the tables and we did not have to wait long for anything - food, drinks, etc. \n\nAs for the show, I have slightly mixed feelings. The numbers were good - a few in particular were downright hillarious/ great! - but I expected a bit more. Mind you, the show was conducted on the back of the bar area. There was not so much a stage as there was a narrow catwalk for the performers, so I guess that doesn't leave much room for anything too outrageous. During our meal (we dined at 9:45pm), there was one 'short' show (about 15-20 minutes long, I would say), and then the 'grand finale (about 25-30 minutes long, I think), with about a 30 minute intermission between the two. Like I said, it was entertaining, but I think I just expected a little more by way of a 'performance.' Still, for what it was, it was very good.\n\nALL IN ALL, if you're into drag-themed restaurants/ shows, this is a place you should go to at least once, just to check it out.

If you look at it as unique dinner theater experience then you might be pleased.  It's fun to take out of town here guests for the novelty of it all unless, like my brother visiting from OH said to me halfway through the show after repeated badgering from me about how hot the girls are, \"I FREAKING ALREADY KNOW THEY ARE ALL GUYS\".\r\n\r\nSorry if I blew the surprise for anyone if they are considering going here but I sort of look at it like the \"I can't believe they were all dead\" thing from \"6th Sense\" or, more appropriately, the oft-spoiled ending to \"The Crying Game\".  At some point you expected everyone to have seen the movie or to have it already ruined.  OK, glad we got that out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment is more or less fun and some of the girls are talented dancers but the songs are all lip synched.  Some of the girls look really amazing and you'll probably get into some heated debates at your table about the logistics of it all.\r\n\r\nThe food, in my opinion, is so-so.  I think that it's generally overpriced, although they do have a prix fixe meal for $31.95 (for parties of 6 or less, I believe) which gets you an appetizer, entree and dessert.  The quality of the food varies.  My favorites are the garlic mussels (appetizer) and the salmon (entree).  The service is pleasant but our appetizers were quite staggered in delivery (ok if you're doing family style, I guess) and one we had to ask about twice and it finally came out when our first entree arrived, which were also delivered in a staggered fashion.  The desserts came all together and mine was wrong but I dealt with it as it was my second choice anyway.\r\n\r\nWe were a party of four and drank 2 bottles of wine and our bill, with tip, came to $72 a person ...which seemed pricey to me based on my experience.  If you're interested in a cheap less-than-$10 alternative, you could grab some cheap Indian food somewhere on Polk St. and then cruise lower Polk and people watch.  Hey, be nice; cheap doesn't have to always have to include safe.\r\n\r\nSo, I would recommend Asia SF to someone who wants to entertain out-of-town guests with a unique experience but don't expect the restaurant part of the experience to be on par with what you are spending.", "author": "Steve B."}

Asia SF seemed like it would be a fun place to try, and a fun place it was...\n\nThe entertainment was fantastic.  The waitresses were hilarious, friendly, and pretty attentive, given they do twice as much as waitresses anywhere else.  Every hour the ladies do a show on the \"runway bar\", and they don't disappoint.  The ladies are hot, the legs are long, and when you've got good company and lots of drinks, you're bound to have a good time.  At one point, our waitress took our friend and had him take a blow-job shot from between her legs at the bar.  Many a priceless photo were taken that night.\n\nSince this is also a restaurant, time to review the food.  We were a group of 6, and if you have a group of 6 or less (yeah, less?), you can do some deal where everyone gets to pick one first course, one second course, and one dessert or dessert drink, for 31$ a person.  I picked some special-of-the-day scallop and noodle dish as my first course, the orange lamb for the second course, and the pineapple cheesecake for dessert (see photos of all 3 dishes).  Some of my friends ordered the asia-dillas, the blackened tuna sashimi, and the truffled soba noodles, and the filet mignon.  No one had any complaints.  For drinks, I stuck to the sex kitten and some other girly-and-oh-so-tasty drink.  Both were excellent and kept me well-entertained throughout the night.\n\nUnfortunately, I went to Asia SF the same week I went to a few other extremely tasty restaurants for food, so while the entertainment was fantastic and the food was pretty good at Asia SF, I can't bring myself to give it 5-stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-25", "description": "11 years later, I finally satisfied my curiosity, and I was truly impressed. \nI'll go for the information/usefulness rather than \"cool\" points in this review. Here it goes...\n\nI made reservations for 9 people for my sister's birthday party. The whole process was very easy and friendly. \n\nI love that someone answered the phone every time I called. I get impatient when restaurants don't answer their phones even during business hours. Even when I made changes to my reservations (went from 10 to 9 people), the change was made and confirmed quickly, seamlessly. Also, they give you the option to personalize your menus when you call to make your reservations. I had a birthday message to my sister on our menus, which made for a great souvenir. \n\nWhen you have a large party, they ask you to commit to one of the three menus they offer. I went for the Gold menu, and was pleased to find out that it's not $38, but $31.95 on a Sunday (as well as on Weds & Thursday; on Friday/Saturday, the same menu costs more). \n\nSome helpful (I hope) tips that I didn't know about just by looking at the website and the online menu: \n* You don't choose your own appetizer/entree when you have a large party. They just bring you a little bit of everything on the menu. It's great: you get all the variety. Everything we got was delicious. At one point, I saw one friend smiling ear to ear with that \"My life is awesome!\" high you get from food that is just right. \n* I had a vegetarian and a pescaderian in my party. They were both very happy to get delicious options. \n* The amount of appetizers was just right. No need to worry that you won't have enough food for everyone. One person in our party even said, \"Wow. I just realized that was just the first course.\" \n* The amount of entrees? Even more abundant than the appetizers, it seemed. That, or we were all filled with the yummy appetizers. We kept saying throughout the night that at $32 per person, we got a great deal!\n* Ice-cream: cute, different, OK. \n* Cocktails: OK. Here's the only area of disappointment. Two people ordered the Lychee Breeze and both disliked it. One person ordered a grapefruit vodka drink...something with Ciera...Also not a satisfactory experience. I tried Vivica's sidecar. It was OK. Each cocktail costs $10, and that's where they got us. Next time (and yes, there will be a next time), I told myself, I'll go with beer and keep it simple and affordable.\n* Birthday party: our server warned my sister ahead of time to be open for a surprise. Later in the evening, she came and got my sister, only after checking in with her, \"You ready?\" My sister is a trooper, so she was a Go. Turns out, she gets a Blow Job shot, which she (and other folks celebrating their birthdays) had to pick up from in between our server's legs (with everyone's attention) on her, with her mouth. All in good fun...until I realized they actually charge you for your surprise birthday drink that you didn't ask for. Another $10. Kind of a turn off. I expected this to be on the house. I mind just enough to take off a star from my review. The cocktails were expensive and mediocre enough to begin with. \n* The show itself was great. We had 7 pm reservations. We got to see two shows during the time we were there. They were all engaging, fun, impressive. (Shit, dancing on those high stiletto boots??? I can't even walk in them!) \n* 20% tip was included, which was helpful. The service was definitely good enough to deserve a 20% tip, by the way. \n\nAsiaSF is definitely a place I will recommend to friends for a birthday party as well as to folks who have an out-of-town guest (or in my case, an out-of-town guest who's celebrating a birthday).", "author": "Yakamoz S."}

Not only was the show great but the food wasn't too shabby either.\n\nThe 'Tamarind Chicken Satay' (marinated chicken breast, skewered and grilled, served with Asia SF's spicy peanut sauce)  was a nice lite starter and the sauce was delicious.  The 'Porcupines' (shrimp, scallops & water chestnuts rolled in cellophane noodles, crisply fried & served with a plum wine/soy dipping sauce) and the 'Asia-dilla' (a quesadilla stuffed with duck, jack & manchego cheese, fresno peppers and scallions, with sun-dried cherry creme fraiche) were both good but neither overly memorable.  I thought the 'Sesame Steak Salad' (thinly sliced beef tenderloin seared and tossed in a sesame dressing, piled atop crisp greens, red onions, mint, and basil) was awesome-it was bright and full of flavor!  The 'Ahi Burger' (freshly ground pan seared ahi tuna, with a teriyaki glaze & horseradish-Chinese cabbage slaw on a focaccia roll) was also delicious, it tasted so fresh!\n\nMoving on......the 'Baby Got Back Ribs' (baby-back pork ribs, grilled with a honey-tamarind glaze, served with pickled carrots and japanese sweet potato crisps) & the 'Orange Lamb' (pieces of lamb sirloin sauteed in a mildly spiced orange sauce, served with coconut jasmine rice & thai cucumber salad) were the best!  The flavors were spot on.  The 'Truffled Soba Noodles' (grilled portobello mushroom & asparagus slices, tossed with cool sesame soba noodles, white truffle oil & scallion threads) were a little bland and not as tasty as the other dishes.\n\nAnd of course a meal would not be complete without 'Miniature Ice Cream Cones' (ube with toasted coconut, langka with sun-dried cherries, macapuno topped with candied peanuts) which were wonderful!\n\nNothing would have paired better with any of these dishes but a variety of cocktails!  'Aaliyah's Tokyo Tea' (Midori Melon Liqueur, Vodka & Rum with Sweet & Sour and Sprite), 'Vivica's Sidecar' (Raynal Brandy, Triple Sec & Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice in a sugar-rimmed BIGtini glass),  'Jasmine's Tarantula' (\"The Ultimate Margarita\"-Cuervo Gold Tequila, Blue Curacao, Triple Sec, Sweet & Sour & Lime Juice) were all delicious but the 'Tarantula' takes the cake!\n\nAsia SF is quite the experience and worth it!

I'm pretty straight laced, but prefer an asian restaurant to specialize in one cuisine and do it well vs. the Pan Asian fad, and I also expect transvestites to be hot, or stay at home and don't bother getting all dressed up.\n\nAsia SF met my standards on both.  I can't remember what we ate, but believe it was multiple small plates and they were good.  As far as the entertainment, those who could sing did well, those who could not were smart enough to lip synch.  I mentioned one person lip synching to my boss from Texas and he did not even know she was a guy.  He then stated, \"I don't know about her, but I salute our watress\" who was a slender thai girl wearing an american flag outfit consisting of a sports bra and boy shorts.

The waitresses on duty danced and lip-synched their hearts out in two shows, and we were astounded at how authentically feminine they seemed. Our waitress had a spunky attitude and kindly took the time out of her busy performaning and costume-changing schedule to be photographed with us. Two of the other waitresses told us that they used to be brothers, and now they are sisters, and stunningly beautiful to boot. We took a picture with one of them, and it's not at all easy to point out which of the seven \"girls\" in the photograph is the transgendered one. One gender-bending moment after another kept our conversations interesting throughout dinner.\n\nThe food was better than I expected. The sesame steak salad contained perfectly marinated beef and light, crispy veggies. The miso-glazed salmon was tender and served atop chewy forbidden rice.

We had a \"large group\" and went for the Gold feast.  You share, family style, and they bring enough items for everyone to get some and still feel satisfied.  We loved the seafood \"porcupines\", the asia-dillas (w/ duckmeat), the lamb, and the ribs.  The chicken satay, ahi burger, and soba noodles were also delicious.  I wouldn't call them my favorites, but had they been the only things we'd gotten to eat I would've still been very satisfied.  And interestingly flavored ice cream for dessert.  High quality, delicious, and filling food.  Big Win.  \n\nThen of course there's the occasional interruption to watch the ladies walk the catwalk.  Yes, they're gorgeous, yes they're classy, yes they have better hair than you.  My favorite part, though, was observing the other patrons, like the high school boy with his parents at the table next to us, visiting from Arizona to check out colleges.  We felt for him and the awkwardness on his face.  Obviously everything here is PG and completely appropriate (ok, we'll call it PG-13), but it's always fun when you see a super hot female who you all know wasn't born that way, and it makes you start to question everyone you'll meet from now on.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

Well, \"that other person\" was sick and decided to stay home to save their energy for the weekend but suggested I call \"the one who wants to go to dinner\". Of course \"the one who wants to go to dinner\" just ate and thought it a good idea for me to trek 5 miles in the sub-zero weather to hang out, pay a cover and hear one song of \"the cool chick who date someone in a band\"s band.  When I objected to this and realized I was almost at the starting time for \"the super awesome birthday boy\"s dinner anyhow I arranged a much needed ride from \"the guy who is organizing the shindig\" to a much needed drink. 5 minutes later I was told that my much needed ride was to be handled by \"the girl with the hybrid\" who would be a bit later, and 5 minutes after that I was miraculously picked up by \"the guy who is organizing the shindig\".  I was then, eventually, whisked away to dinner but not before my boss, who observed the entire phone interaction, looked at me like I was almost as bat shit crazy as my friends. \n\nSo, as you can imagine, I was ready for a fun time. \n\nI was not ready for spotty service between stage acts (if bar counters mean stages) by some hot trannies (if hot trannies mean a bunch of gals who cant lip sync) accompanied by a meal (if a meal means a pause so long in between courses that it makes you think you are full) at a prix fixe price (if prix fixe means double the original bill  after minimal drinks). \n\nHowever, I still had fun because I was graced by the company of the fantastic birthday boy who pretended that my macaroni/construction paper/manila envelope/glue gun card was the greatest thing next to chopped liver, which, of course, it was not. It was, however, the hottest thing next to dinner at Asia SF!", "author": "Drue C."}

Some time later the server returns with a birthday \"shot\" which was consumed in a hilarious manner by the birthday boy (can't spoil the surprise!). .... despite the fact that the shot showed up unannounced and was never ordered, it appeared on our check as an $11 shot ... slightly slimy and tacky practice IMO. \n\nThe most upsetting part was that the bill also contained THREE 20% service charges buried in the body of the check ... you heard me right not one, not two but THREE!!!!!!!! If we had simply thrown down credit cards and not checked the bill, we would have been charged over $150 in service charges. I called the server over and s/he immediately said \"Oh dear, that must be a mistake\" and went away to \"fix\" it, but I was left with the distinct impression that the \"mistake\" was entirely intentional. \n\nAfter a really enjoyable evening, it left me feeling a little angry and disappointed. I wondered how many times a night they do this, and how many times a night it slips through without anybody catching it? \n\nAs many have fellow yelpers have said better than I am able to, this is a really fun place to go for food, drinks and entertainment , and if I excluded the drama around the check I would have given Asia SF 4 stars ....

I was pretty buzzed so I can't remember everything we got but I remember there was ahi tuna, chicken satay skewers, white rice, duck quesadillas, asian salad/slaw looking stuff that was soo yummy, and about 6 other plates of equally as well executed dishes. The show was great, our bachelorette was an amazing sport as the dancers had their way with her. Bartenders were super friendly, they even had our friend go behind the bar and make drinks. I think if you give them your bra you get free drinks or something crazy like that. We stayed there for a couple hours. Did I mention when you arrive on Fridays or Saturdays there is a photographer taking pictures of you outside on a little red carpet?  And since we had a large party, we were given vip access to a couple others clubs that were only a couple blocks away. I believe it was Raven and Slide but like I said, bachelorette party.

With 428 other reviews, why read mine?  No real reason.  A long time ago, like 2001 or 2002, I came here with one other friend, possibly on a weeknight.  The place was empty; the food was not very good and pretty darn expensive.  However, I did think the \"girls\" were hot (lots of push ups but no excessive boob jobs), but maybe I was just really drunk.  I didn't even know there was a show because it happened at the very end of the meal after a couple of those signature drinks.  I still remember having the trio of ice creams.  Fast-forward to last month and the place was packed like sardines in a can, the food was pretty good and WAY more expensive than I could have imagined.  Six of us shared the platinum menu, but I think we were charged as seven, which might explain while there was actually enough food for everyone.  I like the personalized menus - very handy to reference descriptions since it's kind of dark in the restaurant.  Thoughts in no particular order: cherry cr\u00e8me fraiche with asia-dillas tasted like straight fat, garlic peanut sauce with chicken satay was super tasty, herb salad was all cilantro, lamb was good and not gamy at all, truffled soba noodles tasted like butter/oil and baby back ribs were surprisingly yummy.  Why aren't the ice cream flavors listed on the menu or announced when served?  We couldn't tell what they were based on color and taste.  Banana \"beignets\" were awful soggy egg rolls.\n\nThe majority of patrons were bachelorette parties - really unappetizing to see when each celebrant was called up to receive their blow job shot from each \"lady\" sitting on the counter and required to partake in the typical position... eww.  Oh and the girls weren't too attractive; maybe I didn't drink enough.", "author": "Em C."}

We did the Menage a Trois menu (3 courses) which gives you a selection of choices for each course. I started with the blackened tuna sashimi. It was a hearty starter...at least 6-8 pieces of tuna on the plate! Very fresh and delicious. Then I had the miso glazed king salmon for my main course. This was also very good. I especially liked the black \"forbidden\" rice it was served with, it was sort of sweet and cooked very well. The sweet tomato-edamame salad was also very fresh and tasty. The tomatoes were halved cherry tomatoes which I love! For dessert I had the warm chocolate cake. This was by far one of the yummiest chocolate cakes I've had in awhile. It was also a generous portion of cake and ice cream. In the center of the cake was a warm chocolate ganache that oozed out as you cut into the cake with your fork. It was divine with the vanilla ice cream! \n\nThroughout the night there were two shows. The \"girls\" would strut their stuff along the top of the bar table while lip-synching to upbeat songs. It was kind of cheesy to be honest but I have to say, mad props to the plastic surgeons who did these guys! They were beautiful! The other patrons really get into it too (mostly ppl were there for b-day parties or bachelorette parties) which makes the whole experience a lot more fun. I'd definitely recommend this place to those looking for a different experience, fun time and good food.", "author": "Kitty L."}

Asia SF tried to steal from me.\nFirst off, I organized a bachlorette at Asia SF and they told me that they would give us a list of clubs we could go to with no cover after the \"party\" at Asia SF. This was totally NOT true. We went to 2 or 3 of the clubs that Asia SF had on the list and none of them had any idea what we were talking about. \n\nAnd to top it off, Asia SF charged us something like 50 or 60 bucks a person for rice, bok choy and chicken satay (and 1 shot). They had us down in the basement since we were such a big party but the music was SO loud down there we couldn't talk to each other at all. We were just sort of shoved in a corner under the speakers. One person came late and I asked for a bit more food and they said no, even though there was not supposed to be a limit- we were supposed to just get enough food for the event. \n\nAfter our hour was up they pretty much kicked us out of the space and I went to the back room to settle up (since I spent the whole night collecting money). \n\nYou won't believe what happened then. Our bill was around $1,500 and I had all cash. We counted the money twice, and at one point I looked up just in time to see one of them put something in a drawer. I said \"what went in that drawer?\" And the guys said, oh I was just making change, which was completely not necessary because I had 5's, 10's, 20's, 50's and a 100 dollar bill. No need for change making. Then when we came to the end of the counting, guess what was missing? The $100 bill. I said, I know there was a $100 bill, and I know that you guys saw it. I think they were hoping that I would be drunk and confused but the were messing with the wrong girl. They knew that they had been beat and said, yes we saw it, and we won't charge you for it, we must have \"lost it.\"  A bit later, when we were outside getting ready to go on our (turned out to be BS) night of free clubbing, I saw one of the guys that was working with us and I asked him if he found the $100. He did actually admit that, surprise of all surpises, it was in the drawer. The whole thing was strange and a bit crazy. Obviously, they will never see one red cent of my money again.", "author": "Michaela K."}

I came early so parking was not a problem, by early I mean 7pm on a Wed night.\n\nThe food was just ok, but better than I expected for a place where you go mainly for the show. \n\nSome dishes that stood out:\nTruffle Oil noodles: I love all things with truffle oil.\nLamb: My friends found it too spicy and too gamey\nIce cream: Loved it!\n\nEverything was served family style. For us (9) girls, all of us were full by the time we finished. Unless you have a big appetite, it's not THAT small of a meal.\n\nThe show is split in two parts, one in the beginning and one at the end. I have to admit, one of the girls were actually really pretty. The other ones I could kinda tell they were \"girls\". Not as hot as I expected from the other reviews.  They are really funny though, they threw in a couple jokes here and there, and they were really friendly and nice.\n\nRather expensive though.

It was absurdly expensive just for mediocre food and horrendous service.  The busers/servers spilled on one of my dining companions not once, not twice, but three times.  Not drinks, either, mind you.  Sticky bok choy sauce all over her jacket.  They also misspelled the bachelorette's name on the \"customized\" menu, constantly ran into our chairs.  Agree with the other posters...they should go study the Thai drag shows for some tips.  Except the prostitution part.  \nThe downstairs area is funny.

Probably the worst Asian fusion I have ever tasted.\n\nThe reason why people come here; however, is for the \"entertainment.\"\n\nSo here is the story of my experiences here:\n\nI came here without knowing anything of this place because a friend had a b-day here.  So upon entering, we were seated immediately by a \"stunning woman;\" however, I instantly noticed that there was an Adam's apple.  After watching a few \"waitresses\" pass by, I figured it out.\n\nThe reason why I am rating this place more than 1 star is for what happened next.  The people, then one of my roommates, that I went there with said something interesting.  Pretty much the conversation went like this:(R= roommate; RT= anonymous friend)\n\nMe: why are you guys siting on that side of the table?\nR: to see the girls pass by\nRT: yeah we want to clear view of these lovelies\nMe: ....pauses... then cracks up totally.\n\nJust that incident was worth the extra money... was worth the tasteless or over seasoned food.  It was even worth the time where I turned my head (remember I am sitting on the side of the table not facing the dancers) by accident right when the entertainer spread her? legs right in front of me...*mental black out there*\n\nSo pretty much... if you want great food... this is not your place...\nIF you want a show & to get some unsuspecting soul in a situation that you can always hold over them...

They had given us more than enough food for 10 people, and we had ordered from their gold menu which was perfect for everyone's special food request.

We ordered a few drinks and ordered our meal from the menois a troi which gives u one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert per person which was a pretty good deal. He ordered the chicken satay which was pretty good but nothing too special and had the baby got back ribs for main course which he said was \"fall off the bone\" tender and looked like pretty ok portions. I had the garlic mussels which I thought was the BEST thing I had there! It came in a huge asian pho size bowl and must've had like 25+ mussels in there so it's a really decent size..and came with a few slices of garlic bread. For main course I had the crab cakes which was mediocre I thought. Nothing special...maybe a bit on the dry side but crabcakes are usually a hit or miss anyways, I wasn't complaining. We ordered drinks while waiting for our food. He had a vodka tonic and long island. I had a gin and tonic and a mojito. Pretty tasty! As for the show...it took foreverrrrr to get started! Perhaps they wanted to wait til everybody to finish at least past the halfway point of their dinner to begin? Maybe because the lights were too dim to see your food? Maybe because they were afraid some people wouldn't be able to stomach their food during the show?

She had a petite body and had sexy bedroom eyes with no sign of masculinity at all! So after the show...they go around socializing and taking pics with the guest...the bday folks got to have blow job shots with some of the ladies which I thought was super ironic!

To my surprise these beautiful women were actually men dressed in drag.  My friends and I had a wonderful time, and the food is delicious.  I left the restaurant happy, satisfied, and in love with those beautiful women.  What more can a girl ask for.  YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE ASIA SF.", "author": "Allison C."}

I hadn't been to Asia SF in about 5 years, and never downstairs to the club part.  There were 8 other Bachelorette parties there that same night.  Here are my issues:\n1) There was ONE single women's bathroom and the toilet was completely overflowing.  \n2) We had seating in a VIP area, but they offered NO drink service - not even water!  We're paying $45 per person and you don't have someone coming back to serve us cocktails?  We had to fight through the crowd to get to the tiny bar on the other side of the room.  Come on.  We need to get drunk to deal with this place!\n3) For that $45, which is supposed to include dinner, we only get a few trays of appetizers.  They were pretty tasty, but not worth the price.\n4) How many times do I have to hear the same Britney Spears and  Pussycat Dolls songs in a 2-hour window?  According to the Asia SF dj, at least 4 each.  The rest of the music was hip hop with the occasional 80's hit.\n5) That male stripper was just creepy.  Then again, can't really fault Asia SF for that, it just comes with the territory!\n6) The list of \"hot\" clubs that we supposedly get VIP treatment at afterwards?  Yikes.  We ended up going somewhere else.\n\nThis place does get points for the friendly bartenders, decently priced drinks and the beautiful (she)males.  If only real women had bodies like that .  Bitches!!! :)\n\nBottom line:  if you don't live in the city and/or don't get out much and/or are really young and/or don't know any better, you will probably think this is the greatest night out ever.  \n\nPersonally, I'll pass next time!", "author": "Guesty G."}

We did not have dinner in the upstairs dining area so unfortuately I didn't get to see all of the entertainment, but in the downstairs club area several of the \"girls\" danced with the bachelorrettes.  I could only aspire to have a body like that.\n\nWe had our own little are on the corner of the dance floor.  Small but not too bad.  The staff was very attentive, making sure that we had what we needed.  They served us food ala carte and it was much better than I expected.  The asia-dillas were awesome as were the Ahi burgers.  The sesame-steak salad was very flavorful.  I can only assume that the soba noodles were good because everytime I went to get some they were gone.   They have lots of signature cocktails, all were good and strong enough to give me a bit of a buzz.\n\nI would definitely go back again.", "author": "Sheila T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-17", "description": "So we used the Asia SF party planning services because their restaurant was full.  Overall the idea sounded pretty good. . .and had it fit what i expected I would have given it a 4 star.  (Let me clear something up, the party planners were great and I would give them a 3/5 star, it is the venue itself that I am only giving two stars to).\n\nFor $50 we were promised a 3 course dinner, a limo to Asia SF, a round of shots, the show at Asia SF and entrance into other clubs in the city.  We started out at dinner at Town's End - which was quite good.  The 3 courses were very generous and we had a lot to choose from.  No one walked away hungry or disappointed.  I had the salad, baked ziti and apple crisp. . .so good.  We then hopped in our limo where we were rushed in and told not to touch anything because this was not our limo for the night. . .so not so friendly.  We arrived at Asia SF about 10:30 and everyone was super friendly.  We were walked down a flight of stairs into a club area where it was super hot with almost no ventilation.  Note to the owners, one big fan is not enough, please add more.  There were also no bar stools or any place to sit. . .girls in 3 inch heels need someplace to rest their feet every once in awhile.  So after dancing to a few songs wondering when they were going to come and get us for the show i got a major suprise.  They called one of the bachelorettes up on stage, introduced one of their dancers and got to it right there in this small room.  Ok so first off, again i was disappointed we were not taken some place to sit and watch the show.  Second i was disappointed that I couldn't see anything. . .now i am short but even my friend who is 5'10 couldn't see anything.  Another reason seats would be good.  They did one dance, then brought all of the bachelorettes on stage and asked some lame questions and then did one more dance.  Seriously, that was it?  What about my friend, was I going to have to sit through this with the immense heat wave for hours on end?  After another 20 minutes and the decision to find a seat on the step so I could rest my toes, i was told we were going into a private room where my friend would get a dance with one of the dancers.  Great, i can finally rest my feet for real - or so i thought.  If I had blinked I would have missed the show.  It was un-dressed faster than a 17 year old virgin on prom night.  \n\n**So while i am leaving my original post because it was my first impression, I was given some updated informaiton that I will add here.  I guess there are a few options at Asia SF.  One is the dinner show which is upstairs, where you are seated at tables and the ladies perform for you (more along the lines of what I was expecting).  Another option is the club part downstairs which apparently you can choose different packages.  The package that our coordinator chose was for our bachelorette to have a private dance that did not spotlight her so much.  If we had chosen the stage dance then we would have been invited front row while she was on stage and it usually occurs within 20 minutes of the group's arrival.  The idea of the club piece is maybe not to have the group stick around the entire night but instead be there for the quick entertainment and then head out on the town.**  If i had checked out the website and known what i was in for I probably would not have been as disappointed.  \n\nThe party planners did attempt to work things out for our bride to be so that she was not made to feel uncomfortable and it seems that they were quick on their feet to come up with some solutions.\n\nAnyway, my two cents. . .the food at town's end was great, and it was nice to be on the list at other clubs (so the party planning portion was a good idea), but if you want a good drag show, head to Lips In San Diego - way more entertaining and you can even sit at a table!", "author": "Michelle O."}

This has got to be the only time in my life I've ever experienced \"penis envy.\"  \n\nOr, rather, \"lack of penis envy.\"  'Cuz, hot dayamn, the \"ladies of the evening\" at Asia SF are so dang hot, it's not fair. Dangit.  It's just not fair.\n\nLet's get to the point.  It's been awhile since I've eaten there but, from what I recall, the food is yummy.  It's not 5-star orgasmic but, it's not bad for Fusion cuisine.  But, the entertainment and those hostesses MORE than make up for anything that may be lacking in the food.  \n\nUpstairs: Restaurant and rotating performances from each of the \"ladies\" on the bar top.  They lip sync and gyrate and shimmy and shake what their mamas gave 'em (or, in this case, what the plastic surgeon gave 'em) and, the best part, the BEST part, is watching all the men OGLING and drooling over the performers.  OMG, I was dying.  I know friends who've taken unwitting male friends to Asia SF and allowed the guys to believe that the hostesses were \"the real deal\" - one friend even had the hostess play along when one of the guys tried to get her number.  But, no joke, the looks on some of these chumps' faces - you gotta wonder if they realize, when they're staring up the performers' skirts, that there used to be a genuine \"member only\" club up in that region.  At the end of the night (around 11pm-midnight), all the performers are introduced along with birthday/bachelorette party shout-outs.\n\nDownstairs:  Fellas, if you've ever wondered where in the heck to party in the Bay Area to even out that guy:girl ratio, you need to pay a visit to the club at Asia SF.  There are about 10:1 girls:guys - and all the guys are either behind the bar working or working the club as security, which means that, really, there are NO guys in the Asia SF club.  Score!!  \n\nAnd, ladies, if you actually do have penis envy and wonder who it feels to be a horny, rowdy guy, your loving and loyal girlfriends can pay $150 to get one of the \"ladies\" to lap dance for you on stage.  Professional photographers are snapping those incriminating photos while the performers \"go downtown\" on you and guide your hands all over their,....areas.  I would post pictures of the lap dance given to my bachelorette friend but, um, I think Yelp! would remove the photos due to inappropriate content.  \n\nAlthough I am in no way, shape or form advocating the objectification of women, I'm sorry but, Asia SF is just too much fun to pass up.  \n\nPS) If you go, be sure to snap a photo of/with \"the one who looks like Jessica Alba.\"", "author": "Nancy L."}

The place is very cramped and eating w/ chopsticks can be a bit a of a challenge in a tight space like that but what a great place for a fun evening and an entertaining show.", "author": "Tammy D."}

When they found out that I didn't want to go, we were going to go somewhere else, but I convinced them that it was ok and in we went.\n\nThe whole establishment is quite small with the restaurant upstairs and the club downstairs. In the middle of the room is the bar (and the dance stage). We were seated and since we were a party of three, we were able to order the menage a trois. My sister and I ordered our drinks (I believe one of was pink kitten but I forgot the name of the other) which were sweet and delicious. For our meal, we each ordered something different so we could try as many courses in our one trip. For the first course we ordered, the porcupines, the ahi burger, and the blackened tuna sashimi. The porcupines were excellent with the dipping sauce. My sister loved the sauce so much, she saved it for other dishes that came along later in the meal. The ahi burger was HUGE! I could've eatten it as my main course. It was delicious! The blackened tuna sashimi was also good, however it had a VERY strong pepper taste that gave it quite a kick.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the \"baby got back\" ribs, sansho spiced filet mignon, and the miso glazed king salmon. The ribs were moist and very soft. The glaze was phenomenal!  The filet mignon was also cooked to perfection and the potato stars were the cutest things ever! It reminded us of the happy faced potatoes from the jelly belly factory. The salmon was juicy and very flavorful.\n\nThere were two \"ladies\" that we couldn't tell if they were real women or one of the \"ladies\" but when they stepped on stage for the show (the \"ladies\" dancing & lip syncing), that gave it away. Haha my bf was trying to figure it out the whole time prior the show. Man were those two a doozie! One of the \"ladies\" gave us a free shot of something really sweet and tasted yummie! The show was hilarious and quite amusing. My favorite was the last \"lady\" who sang \"Everyone's been F*ing but Me.\" One of the owners could be seen walking around talking to customers and refilling water. He looked like he was having a blast. He must really enjoy his company!\n\nBy dessert, I had enough alcohol so we stayed away from the dessert drinks. Yes, I'm a light weight but only recently! ^^;; Our \"waitress\" had highly recommended the warm chocolate cake (saying it was better than sex) so my sister ordered the dish. I ordered the banana beignet split while my bf ordered the trio of miniature ice cream cones.  The chocolate cake was moist and pretty good (tho I wouldnt say it was better than sex). The banana beignet was too big for me to finish alone (I didn't realize it was to serve two people in the first place) in addition to me being too gone to take in too much food/drink prior to the dessert even arriving.The miniature ice cream cones were so adorable and creamy.\n\nDefinitely will be returning with some unsuspecting friends! ^_^", "author": "Kitty K."}

When my bf and I got there, our seats disappeared and we stood there for about 10 minutes before they brought out our chairs. We sat down and I started to feel uncomfortable because the people sitting behind me kept elbowing my back and leaning against me to take pictures of the people in their group. How rude! Anyways, about the food.. I really liked the short ribs, fried banana and the ice cream dessert. They've got interesting flavors! I was about to give 3 stars but I'm surprised at the good service they gave considering how packed and crowded it is. They wouldn't forget about you if you ordered drinks or asked for some water and napkins.\n\nThe hot woMEN waitresses were very entertaining! Throughout the night these ladies danced on the countertops and you can take pictures of them. It was fun to watch the birthday girl in our group take a blowjob shot on one of the hot chicks. Our favorite lady of the night is named Aliyah. She's pretty damn hot! After you empty your pockets for the bill, you can continue your night at the club downstairs (It's free). I would probably not come here again just because I can get the same quality food for cheaper elsewhere but it's a place you should go to at least once in your lifetime for the experience.", "author": "Laura W."}

The lovely \"ladies\" of Asia SF provided a fun atmosphere and the food was surprisingly better than I remember!  \n\nThe duck quesadilla with sun-dried cherry creme fraiche appetizer plate was SO good!  The food is served tapas/family style--they just bring one of each item on the appetizer menu and the entree menu (or 2-3 plates of each, depending on how many in your party).  They also had vegetarian options of most menu items and they asked us how many vegetarians were in our party when we sat down.  The cosmos were very tasty.\n\nBut, back to the real reason to go here...the ladies!  The show started off a little slow, and proceeded to get better and better.

I guess it doesn't seem surprising to have such a place in San Francisco after all.  Now on to the review...\n\nWe had made reservations about  a day prior and were able to score seats at the bar area only.  It seems as if EVERY table and I mean EVERY table was celebrating some sort of occasion, whether it was a birthday or a bachelorette party, to whatever else people celebrate now a days.  Even though we arrived somewhat late, they were able to accommodate us quickly at the bar.\n\n The food was good. but not great. We each started off with our own appetizers. I had ordered the asia-dilla (a quesadilla stuffed with duck, jack cheese, cilantro & fresno peppers served with a sun-dried cherry crme fraiche) which was barely stufed with anything... I honestly felt it was just a cheesea-dilla and the other appetizer was some sort of seafood filled rolls which was not bad and actually had a good amount of what was advertised stuffed inside.   For the main course we ordered the fillet mignon and the orange lamb.  The fillet mignon was good, but a bit dry and served with star shaped fries. My lamb was served with a side scoop of rice and 3 large round chips shoved on top, whether it was to compliment the food or just for decoration... I have no idea. The lamb was tender as it should be, but the sauce may have been a little bit much for my liking. To clear things up first, when you order food you pay a fixed price. Each person chooses from a 1st meal, 2nd meal, and dessert. To finish off the evening we ordered the banana split, which is much like PF Changs banana spring rolls if anyone has ever tried that.  This had to be my favorite of all the meals... the bananas were wrapped in an eggroll paper and fried just right, and it was served with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream (maybe would have been better if it was coconut?) Since the dessert was big compared to the other ones offered it counted as both of our desserts, but Im glad we ordered it.  For the two meals and 3 drinks the total bill came out to just a little over $100.\n\n  If it were not for the thematic experience and the shows with all the pretty ladies... oh I mean guys, haha... I dont think the food alone would be worth the price. We were entertained twice throughout our meal with two separate shows on top of the counter top.  Word to the wise, if you have to sit at the bar... dont sit at the corner seat nearest to the entrance, unless you want to be part of the show and have your head used as a prop that is. Although I did not go to the downstairs floor for anything but the restroom, they have a little club area with a dance floor and a DJ and I do think they have some shows going down there as well.  I didn't try it myself, but they also offer blowjob shots that you can take between the ladies... I mean guys legs. All in all a memorable experience. Thanks homey", "author": "Steven T."}

First, we went downstairs because on the weekend, this place is rammed and you will have to wait for your table. \r\n\r\nDownstairs, there are a couple of bars and lots of people. Some dancing, some drinking, some doing both. The drinks were a bit expensive, but such is life in SF. As you hang out and wait for your table, your eyes begin to wonder. This happened to me. I was at the bar and then I noticed that there were black sheets hanging up. And within the splits of these sheets, I noticed that there was a kind of private show going on. I'm guessing bachelorette party. Anyway, they all sounded like they were having a good time. After a little dancing and such, we headed upstairs for the dinner. \r\n\r\nThe food came from a set menu that we chose done family style. It is a bit pricey, but is to be expected. The tables and booths are located around the center stage where the entertainment is held. As you sit and mingle with your friends or what have you, the show begins. The night usually starts off with the host, a bubbly wigged man, doing the normal emcee thing. Then a stream of queens come out on stage one after the other swinging on the polls and dancing around. You will probably first think, there's some guys and girls mixed into this performance, but you will be surprised to find out that it is all boys. I know, hard to believe, it's normally the smaller ones that it is difficult to tell. Anyway, long story short, when all the shows were over, the waitress came over to me and set a drink down on the table. I was confused because I did not order another drink and I was sitting with all the people in our party. Someone had bought me a drink. I'm thinking it was one of the dancers! Awesome! Anyway, my girl friend got a free drink and to you mysterious drink buyer, I say thank you!!!", "author": "Andrew Y."}

We had a private performance in the basement area (pole and mirrors included) by Steve, who came out as a fireman. He was great, the bachelorette had a really good time. Then we went upstairs for the Asia SF show. The women are \"gender illusionists\" (read: gender is/was not always female) and they put on one hell of an illusion! I question the authenticity of my gender in comparison when looking at them as they are absolutely stunning. They're great dancers and singers as well. The food was good, but quite pricey, so be prepared to shell out some cash when you go there. But hands down, a great place to take a lady when it's either her bachelorette or birthday because there aren't that many places to find male strippers.", "author": "Donna W."}

Well if you chose any of those you were wrong. I had a friend visiting and he said he was with Sharon and Kelly Osborne as well as Megan Mullally and they would be picking me up for dinner. I didn't even ask where we were going! Low and behold we ended up at, yep you guessed it  Asia SF. I must say my experience was a much better than all of the rest, we sat right up at the bar the drinks were flowing, except for Kelly who was on the wagon. For some reason the food tasted better, the drinks stronger and the show was more entertaining. At the end of the night Sharon was going to pick up the tab when the manager said that her money was no good there, she then tried to give a big tip to our bartender / waiter and the owner refused to let him accept the money, at first I thought that was cool of him but then I thought how I would be pissed if I worked for that guy. \n\nI truly think that everyone should check this place out once, yet I am pretty sure that there is not much of a need to go back again, of unless of course you are going with the Osborne's and Karen from Will and Grace ;-)", "author": "Bobby B."}

The party packages are astronomical, $78 per person gets you 3 courses (tax and tip incl) a shot and some dancing with frighteningly insane brides to be in the cave downstairs. The divas are definitely worth a look, quite entertaining and a little disarming. How a man can sculpt his body to look better than most of our's is pure medical magic.\r\nThen there are the drinks. $10 for just about everything, a bottle of Bud though, a mere $5. Then they rack that up on a separate bill and add another 20% (!?!?!) gratuity. That's wrong on a few levels.\r\nThe disco was going off at 7pm, lots of drunk ladies, I suppose this is a great place to score an easy lay. We watched girls dance with blow up dolls with enormous members and taking their bras off to be stapled upon the wall of shame. Tragic, but entertaining in that watching a train wreck sort of way.\r\nThe bar staff downstairs are pretty lovely.

We stayed long enough to see several shows. Our friends initially did not know the theme of this restaurant. When our waiter/waitress showed up one of my friends was like, WTF? But then he spotted one who was super hot, and got confused. It's great entertainment; they'll dance on the bar to songs like PCD and Britney Spears.. it was awesome.\nThe food was unique, but I think it tasted OK. Our waiter/waitress? was quite nice. My boyfriend's food came after everyone ordered (even though someone else at our table had ordered the same thing as he did). Another waitress let him get a drink on the house since he had to wait for so long, which was quite nice. I'm a big fan of dessert, but I have to say theirs did not impress me.

After we were all crammed into a booth/table, butted up next to another group with barely enough room to move let alone have any sort of private conversation.  Honestly, it seemed like our \"waitress\" was more interested in talking to her friends than making sure we had everything we needed.  Even when she came to bring the birthday girl shots she didn't seem all that happy to be there or to be helping us.  I understand everyone has bad days but when you work at a place were you are serving people sometimes you just need to fake it.  I had to wait 10 minutes her her to bring my drink order that I could see sitting on the bar waiting for me 2 minutes after I ordered it.  On top of that we were totally rushed through our meal, waiter's and food runners were constantly moving plates and pushing us to move on to the next course.  Our courses came out maybe 20 minutes apart or less.  \n\nOn a positive note the performance part of the night was totally entertaining and the drinks were great.  When we did finally get bar service it was good.\n\nThen the bill came and all of us became really disenchanted with our experience.

Our waiter bought dessert while we were still eating our entree. I asked them to take dessert away, so they brought the check instead.\n\nIf they insist on serving you three courses, then they either have to start earlier, or be more efficient between appetizers and entree and get the meals out early.\n\nSome of the girls were disappointing too - how difficult can it be to learn to lip-synch.

We went with the EZ payment option of $65 per person on the Platinum meal, which included tax and tip, and a round of cheap shots.  Be wary of the cost of drinks though.  Their specialty drinks are $10 and for me, a gin and tonic was $7.  Our drink bill came out to $125 for eight people.  Now, besides the lovely cost, which was reasonable to me.  The food was only OK.  I mean, its served in a nice format, family/appetizer style and there was enough food for everyone.  But the flavors were kind of bland.  The Asia-dilla, was just cheese, onion, chives in a tortilla.  How is that an Asian version of a quesadilla?   The orange lamb was drenched in syrup, bok choy was a bit overcooked, but the ribs, salmon, and chicken satay were good.  Oh and the dessert was yummy too.  So now the entertainment.  My, these gals sure have confidence and love their jobs, seducing men and women, and poking fun that they still might have their kibbles and bits in between their legs.  They were playing peek-a-boo all night.  Very sweet girls and love how their voice sounds like a boy in puberty again.  And they some how manage to dance even in tight sheeps clothing.  I loved it, especially watching my friends do a shot between their fake boobs.  Let's just say my mouth was wide open throughout the whole performance.  Would love to go again soon.

The food is actually really good, but is the price worth it? I think not. The drinks are SUPER expensive (think at least $10 - $15 for a one-shot infused drink). I asked the waiter numerous times for a glass for water -- REJECTED. The announcers, dancers and waitresses kept hassling us to order more drinks. When the dinner/show was over, the announcer still kept hassling everyone to stay and drink more. Hmm....I wonder whats on their mind. The show was okay, first time experience for such a thing but you can tell the dancers were kind of stuck-up. Five dancers for five minutes = 25 minutes of show time. All they did was lip sync and kind of wiggle their hips on top of the bar = SNORE. The drunk girl dancing at the bar is more entertaining. Not only that, I was unfortunately sitting on the stool side so the whole time my neck hurt trying to look at the show and eat dinner. For fifteen people, our tab was $1,700 = RIDICULOUS.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-23", "description": "no bachelorette party is complete without the requisite stop at asia sf.  this is because:\n\na) the bride-to-be can enjoy the \"entertainment\" knowing that her hubby-to-be won't be jealous or feel threatened by the ladies of asia sf.***\nb) the bridal party can pick up some makeup and beauty tips and ideas from the ladies of asia sf.\nc) it's a one stop shop - dinner, drinks and dancing, what more do you need?\nd) all of the above.\n\ni've been to/hosted three bachelorette parties in the past three years, and asia sf is always a fun destination.  they make it easy by providing a range of party packages, with a range of prices, all reasonable considering the amount of food provided.  you can dine upstairs and enjoy the performances during dinner or dine downstairs in a private section (complete w/ stripper pole).  and the food itself is worth return visits.  preset menus for large parties start at $38 (plus tax/20% tip, not including drinks) and offer a huge variety of dishes to be served family style.  my most recent party featured 5 appetizers, 4 \"entrees\", and a selection of mini ice cream cones and banana \"beignets\" for dessert:\n\n- blackened tuna sashimi:  yum.  great texture, nice peppery kick.\n- tamarind chicken satays:  very well seasoned chicken w/o the peanut sauce, but the peanut sauce is not to be missed!\n- asia-dilla:  okay, can't really tell it's duck but still good.\n- baby bok choy & shiitakes:  nicely seasoned and a good \"healthy\" option to balance out all the alcohol and dessert\n- grilled shrimp & herb salad:  personally, i'm not a cilantro fan, so i skipped this one...\n- miso glazed king salmon:  well-cooked salmon, but i couldn't really taste the miso glaze.  i was more interested in the accompanying black rice and sweet tomato-edamame salad.\n- orange lamb:  i'm learning to appreciate lamb, but this was a bit tough and a little gamy.  the thai cucumber salad on the other hand was amazing.  a little sweet, a little sour, and a surprising spicy kick at the end!  the perfect palate cleanser.\n- baby got back ribs:  super yummy (but messy) ribs - on the sweeter side but also savory. yummy pickled carrots and beets plus awesome sweet potato chips.  i think this was my fave dish overall, the \"star\" and its backup singers.\n- truffled soba noodles:  okay.  can't really taste the truffle oil, not much flavor, but at least the noodles were a nice texture.\n\nand then there are the ladies of asia sf.  they sooooo rock!  it's hard not to hate on their smooth cellulite-free legs, their quarter-bouncable buns, and gorgeous hair...they've definitely paid handsomely (pardon the pun) to look so great, but whoever does their work is awesome.  always entertaining on stage and oh so accommodating as servers.\nthe umbrella routine kicked ass and the eva-longoria look-alike does a mean shakira too!\n\na couple of quibbles:  \n\n-overcrowded tables - really, seating 7 around 2 tiny tables that are each meant for 2 people?  understandably they want to pack the room, and every saturday appears to be a sold-out crowd, but they've gotta be breaking some fire code.  it was a challenge to find room for every plate on the table...\n- waiting 45 minutes to be seated for dinner - thank goodness for the club downstairs, we were able to knock back some drinks and work up an appetite on the dance floor.  but they made up for it by comping us a free round of drinks (and their specialty drinks are dangerously delicious!)\n\noverall, 4.5 stars.\n\ntips:\n- parking can be hit or miss.  if you don't have a limo/party bus, at least security will work his flashlight to flag down a cab.\n- if you're planning a party, try to work with noah - he rocks!  not only can he help plan your dinner, he can also help you with entertainment, transportation, and post-dinner options.\n\n***there are male dancers (not the feminine kind!) available for private parties in the downstairs section - hubbies-to-be beware!", "author": "Jen P."}

I believe there was some sort of cover but somehow there was confusion at the door and we ended up slipping inside for free.  The downstairs area was pretty crowded and as we walked in one of the \"shows\" was happening on stage at the side of the room.  The club shows seem to basically consist of a really hot \"woman\", judging from the name they're also all Asian, doing a lap dance for some lucky customer.  The chick dancing when we walked in was wearing a cop outfit I think and was hotter than most actual women I've seen in real life.  It was hard to get a good look because there was such a big crowd around but after she came out again for second show some 20 or 30 minutes later we got a much better view.  The music was a bit all over the place, I remember some hip-hop and some hustle specifically, but not bad to dance to overall.   The disappointing thing was that it seems that you really have to come here for dinner to get the real experience, the trannie shows downstairs at the club are too few and far between but the waitresses upstairs looked amazing as we were walking out.  I'll have to come back and check out their food next time I'm in SF.", "author": "Herman S."}

When we walked in, there was an immediate wave of a lively atmosphere.  However, once we were seated, I was a bit disappointed.  We were given a table in the back corner near a very busy spot that had another entrance (the door was opened so there was a constant draft).  A friend spoke up, and we were immediately given some free libations, so our moods definitely perked up.  The show itself was very entertaining, and the 'women' are BEAUTIFUL!  As far as our entrees- when our food arrived, we couldn't help but devour everything.  The food was very, very delicious...that is until I found a LONG, BLACK hair in my food!  I swear I think it was from a wig or hair extension.  I immediately spit everything out on my plate.  That definitely ruined it for me.

The \"girls\" are 10/10 and they are a lot prettier than real females. I told her that was impossible because I can always point em' out and I can tell. Last Saturday, Alice, Victor, and I went to Asia SF. To my surprise, the \"girls\" are beautiful. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by their appearance because some of the \"girls\" are very pretty  with a nice figure. Furthermore, the food there was really good. I normally prefer authentic asian food but the dishes I had were satisfying. I had the sashimi tuna and prime ribs. They were both great dishes but I liked the ribs more because the taste and texture of the meat was perfect. Besides pretty \"girls\", great food, a delightful ambiance, this venue has great customer service. The employess are very friendly and always smiling at me. Even the security greeted me or said, \"Hi\" to me. Because believe me, I've been to clubs/bars in the Bay Area before and some of the bouncers/sercurities are rude and disrespectful. And I thought to myself...\"Mmm...I'm your customer, give me some respect will ya?\" Overall, I gave Asia SF five stars. Three stars are for pretty girls, great food, and a delightful ambiance. The other two stars are for great customer service. This is a great place to take your friends. I highly recommend this place!", "author": "Linh N."}

I had heard about this place since I moved to the SF area for over a year. For $60 a person, I left disappointed.  Our party of 6 sat on bar stools at a high table stuck up against a poorly lit wall.   Small amounts of food was served community style, dropped in front of us & each person probably got 2 bites a piece.  Our table was constantly bumped by people going to the bathroom.  The entire restaurant is small, with a bar and tiny walk-way for the divas to strut their stuff in the middle of the narrow rectangle room.  I didn't have one drink, instead opting to drink the one free glass of champagne included in our $60 a pc tab.  Another couple with us had two drinks and someone else in the group had two.  The $100+ tip was automatically added to our bill of 599.00.  Had I had to do it all over again,.. A BIG NO!  A shrewd businessman would steal all the business of this run-down, over priced restaurant, if they opened up across the street in a modern, well-lit large building.  All they would have to do is add real food to the plates and hire the divas to come across the street and BAM! Asia SF would be out of business.", "author": "Margot S."}

Upon arrival we were sent down stairs because they were running behind, this was fine, the night club down stairs was fun, we ordered drinks and waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated. This was actually okay, we were having a great time, spent lots of money in their bar downstairs were starving when we were seated for dinner. The night was a usual Asia SF night....very fun(i had been here 2 other times this year for various occasions, 10 of the 12 people had not been there). The problem came when it was time to pay...it was a rather large bill, everyone had cash. We counted the cash several times at our table and it was right on. The waitress took our money...AND COUNTED IT in front of us....then walked away only to return 10 minutes later telling us it was an EVEN $100 short. I had not been drinking at all and had counted it myself and this was surely not the case. It seems that somewhere between one end of the bar and the other $100 vanished , I have no idea what happened to it, it might have just fallen out of the checkbook, but in any case it was gone. We ended up speaking to the manager who took care of it, and we were on our way with a VERY BAD taste in our mouths and a BAD experience under belts. It's a fun place but be careful, I am not sure what happened to the money, they handled the situation in a good way, and after posting my initial review Noah emailed me very concerned about the situation. I really appreciate it when a business shows it cares about its customers. Unfortunately, the other 10 people in my party had never experienced Asia SF before and this was the first experience there.", "author": "Jill T."}

Apparently if you have a party of 6 or more, you have to chose from the large party menu, the Gold, Platinum or Diamond with a set list of courses (you get every dish listed under each menu). After we chose one, we found out last second that the other people in our party bailed so we had to cover the flakers for the $400 something bill. By then, it was too late to cancel any of the food. I was completely pissed off by the time the second course came around. The ladies were extremely nice, especially our waitress Dee(sp?) (she was the hottest one there!)

We made reservations in advance and chose the set menu which was $38 per person. So when we arrived on Sat. night we were seated to our table fairly quick. The place was friggin' packed! What kinda irked me out was that the tables we're so close together, I was bumping shoulders with the girl sitting over on the next table, very annoying I must say. But after a few cocktails it was ALL GOOD IN THE HOOD.  I had this bombass Lychee cocktail, sooooo goooood. Our server was Aaliyah, she was so pretty and very attentive to our table.  I was  surprised the food was that good. Our whole table had 4 appetizers and 4 entrees family style. The best part was the dessert, mini ice cream cones with several different flavors. Ube ice cream with coconut mmmmm...need I say more? So while enjoying your wonderful dinner, dancers with come out one by one all dressed up and lip sing and dance. Some of them have moves I tell you. People were taking blow job shots off the servers too, very entertaining. After dinner we moved downstairs to the dance floor and took several more shots while this creepy short old man was trying to freak all of us from behind WTF? gross. After security escorted the perv away it was time to hit the dance floor. Holy crap is that a stripper pole I see? Lol. Indeed it was, a stripper pole. My girls and I attempt to dance on the pole like professionals and was unsuccessful. How the hell do you twirl on them friggin' poles!?

I planned a going away party for a fellow co-worker here once. I called. Made a reservation for 25? Picked a menu and a name for the \"personalized\" dinner menus. Everything went very smooth when we arrived. I admit, the personalized menu adds a nice touch to the guest of honor and the entire vibe of your party. It feels a little more intimate in a could be rowdy place. There's a lot to take in when you first arrive, especially if it's your first time. Many guys will gawk at the women and say \"no.....that's not a guy!\" because they secretly probably find the miss very attractive. The price is about 60-70 a person depending on the menu you pre-ordered. Some may say thats pricey. BUT. You get a show, entry to a club down stairs, dinner, dessert (the cutest mini ice creams ever, and you're in beautiful SF) So I think it's well worth it. I also think it's awesome that the gracious hosts and entertainers are representative of women in all sizes and shapes. From a size 2 to 12...they do a fabulous job of getting the party started and keeping it going! And if you have a birthday guest of honor -- make sure you order them a Blow Job..the shot drink! (This is not the OTHER type of place. Sorry  you may want to hit up Broadway Street for that type of hanky panky!), which they will gladly place the shot between the legs of  your lady of choice and your bday guest will get to take it by mouth...and with no arms of course!", "author": "Jen V."}

We haven't been to Asia SF yet so we decided to check it out. I invited my two sibs since they work in the city and so they can check out the place too. We didn't have reservations that night since it was a last minute decision so we weren't sure if they would let us in right away, and sure enough they did! We ordered  food and drinks from their menu, and we totally loved everything we had! A bit pricey and portions are a bit small (then again you can't really expect family style servings there), but what we liked most was the entertainment! I hated that the 'gals' are more prettier than me! Haha! We were so entertained that I thought to myself I would come back (I even thought of having my bachelorette party there). Will try to check out the dance floor next time.", "author": "Cindy S."}
