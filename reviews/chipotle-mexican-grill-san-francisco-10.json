I ordered the chicken bowl with a tortilla on the side and I am just so impressed with how fast the service was! I went around 12:30pm on a Tuesday so of course there was a lunch line rush but once it came to my order, it went by with the snap of my fingers (probably less than a 1 minute order!) I really like this place too because they were quite generous with the portions and and had friendly service. I ate in with my friends and we were also observing how one of the employees was making a burrito with such care. He put all the ingredients on the burrito and mixed it up instead of having one side overwhelmed with sour cream while the other side overwhelmed with rice. Very smart and thoughtful service to enhance the taste of the burrito. Overall, positive experience, quick service, tummy was very satisfied and clean interior.", "author": "Amy L."}

I've noticed tons of office workers forming insanely large lines at Chipotle for years and finally decided to give it a try.  So the line itself took me roughly 17 minutes to get my burrito.  It rang up at $14.45 and that's *without* any chips or drink.  And worst of all, it was below mediocre, potentially one of the worst lunches I've had in years.\n\nCarnitas & Steak Burrito w/ Guacamole: Anyone who rolls a burrito like this in San Francisco should be ashamed of themselves.  It was a halfhearted attempt to loosely close the sides together; no bunching the ingredients tightly together and no cleanly sealed roll.  I get that there is a good amount of filling, but burrito professionals in the Mission manage to work with similarly large burritos just fine.  For all the talk about fine ingredients, the meat wasn't that great.  The steak had a few gristly bites and the carnitas were very bland and without any sort of crispy texture.  The guacamole was a pretty stingy small clump, despite the upgrade fee.  The beans were nice though, probably the one highlight.  Had a bit of sticker shock at the register: $14.45.  For that price, you could eat like a king at any Mission taqueria (and they won't charge you for chips & salsa).", "author": "Adam B."}

Consistant, quick for the days you don't have a lot of time,  and healthier (relatively) than most other options. Ingredients are clean and I like the fact that brown rice is an option now.  As the internet says \"not all heroes wear capes\". \n\nUsually I'll alternate between barbacoa and chicken burrito WITH guac (yes, I know it's extra. Why is this even a question?) black beans and brown rice. If I'm extra health conscious I'll get a bowl with the same. The chips have hints of lime, and the fact that all chipotles carry Tabasco sauce ( mild and hot) deserves a star on it's own in my book. \n\nIs it the best burrito in the world? No, but it's pretty damn good. Say what you want about \"authenticity\", this is not about that. I'm going purely on taste and quality here. Both areas where chipotle excels at. There is something to be said about how they have made clean food accessible ( especially in FiDi where a salad alone is 15 bucks) and how quickly they get through the massive lunch lines. Occasionally you'll run into someone who doesn't wrap your burrito right, or is stingy for a little more of something, but by far everyone I've encountered has been helpful and upbeat. \n\nI could not imagine living somewhere where there isn't a chipotle ( I did once for a year and I'll never go back).

Pun intended. \n\nToday I went there, ordered a burrito from the guy with no hat on and hair in his face beyond his eyes. And he kept flipping his head around to keep it back too. Might as well have just sprinkled hair all over the meat while he was at it. I'm sure someone gets to eat his hair today. Everyone else had on Chipotle hats, why not this weirdo?\n\nAfter ordering all of my ingredients the girl that was folding it up struggled and struggled and then she grabbed another piece of foil to just make sure it closed. I saw this all going down and just let it happen. As I rang out I asked the girl to give me a bowl, because I know what I was going to be experiencing back at my office desk. \n\nAnd sure enough, when I got back and pulled back an inch or two of foil I was met with falling onions and tomatoes. I revealed more and could now see an entire cross-section of my burrito exposed under foil. How the hell would I eat this in burrito form had I not grabbed a bowl as a backup?\n\nMorons. Train your people how to make the product they are serving.\n\nSorry to be harsh, but this is not the first surprise burrito explosion I've gotten.\n\nOh yah, my chips are stale as hell today too, that is a first. They feel like they were wet and then dried out.", "author": "Mack L."}

What a dreadful Chipotle. On 2 different visits (over a 1-week period) I have waited 10-15 minutes for the chicken to be ready and there was no mild salsa, corn salsa, or guacamole. Worse, the staff are so busy chatting with each other about their personal lives that they have no idea what you've said or what you want (and they really don't seem to care about anything).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-12", "description": "I love the line here during lunch times. It's the only time of the day I can actually go outside and see people, and Chipotle doesn't disappoint.\n\nCome here between 12-1 and you are sure to see a huge line that curves around the inside of the place. Poor customers who wanted to dine in and have a nice, quiet, peaceful lunch instead get to be at the center of all these random people waiting patiently to get a taste of Chipotle Mexican food.\n\nThere are 2 stages of line waiting here. Stage 1 is that the line is normal Chipotle line length and ends before the main entrance. If it is Stage 1, you can expect to wait under 10 minutes for your food. Stage 2 is that the line extends past the main entrance so that you enter and actually have to walk 10-20 feet left towards the soda machines/bathroom to find the end of the line. In Stage 2, you can expect to wait ~15-20 minutes for your food.\n\nNot much to say about the food -- it's Chipotle! And you can find one almost anywhere in the Bay Area nowadays, all with the same menu. The only thing that matters is how you can get the most out of the servers in each restaurant. There are notoriously stingly Chipotle's (e.g. next to UC Berkeley on Telegraph), and there are some really generous Chipotle's that stuff your burritos/bowls to the max (e.g. Cupertino on Steven's Creek). \n\nThis Chipotle (which Yelp says is on California Street but the entrance I always enter from is on Sacramento street) is about average. They tend to initially give portions on the smaller end, but when I ask them for some more they have always obliged and increased the quantity a decent amount. So make sure to ask! Or even better, go search on Google for an article about how to get the most bang for your buck when ordering from Chipotle. It is an art that I am merely adept at. I hope that someday I will be able to hone my skills and become a master. Until then, this shall end my review. Salutations.", "author": "Eric S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-26", "description": "Okay, now I haven't been to a Chipotle in probably 2 years, but I actually remembered it being pretty high quality, simple and fast. It seems like in the last two years they've made a major cost reduction in the quality of the food, the chicken was actually quite fatty, which is really odd for this type of chopped up chicken. I feel like in the past it was of a much higher quality, and possibly even white meat only.  In addition the carnitas actually were so salty that I couldn't even finish them. Overall, I'm very disappointed in the quality of the food, which is the reason they get a low rating. There are many newer places, especially in this area that serve up traditional foods in interesting ways with good quality and modern trendy ingredients. There is really just no reason to go to Chipotle when you can go 100 feet in any direction and get better food for a similar price. Needless to say, I won't be back anytime soon.\n\nI will add just one positive comment, the staff here is pretty friendly and seems to do a real good job considering the low quality product they have to deal with coming from corporate.", "author": "Cameo W."}

The first time I was here, they also got my coworker and my orders mixed up and handed us each a bag with the wrong order inside.

They're one of the more consistent places in terms of quality which ever one you go to. \n\nThis place just opened about a month ago and like some other reviewers, I too was very excited to see the \"opening soon\" sign. As some of us know that the next closest one is few blocks away on Market st. And don't even get me started on the lines at that place. Expect minimum 10 - 15 mins in line at lunch time on a normal working day. \n\nI walked by one day and finally it's opened! My excitement quickly died when I saw the line. A week later I walk by, wow! The line is just as long if not worse. Where did all these people have lunch before this place opened? Do they not ever get tired of Chipotle? :) You know that most of these people are repeat customers who work nearby. Is Chipotle really THAT GOOD? \n\nI finally set aside enough time today to prepare to stand in line no matter what. The line wasn't so bad when I got there but already out the door. I got my food quickly as usual. Most of the Chipotle lines move quickly as they're very fast and efficient. But this place is extra fast. Be prepared to be rushed and herded like sheep at this place. Yes portions are smaller than others like some reviewers said. It's understandable though if you look at amount of people in line waiting for food. They can only make them so fast! \n\nDon't let the 3 star review fool you though. The food quality is good as expected. Just be ready to wait if you really want it!
