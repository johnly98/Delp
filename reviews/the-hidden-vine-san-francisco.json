It really lives up to its name as it is sort of hidden in an alley way. The wine was good and pricing as expected for San Francisco. I will say the service here was particularly great. A group of four of us walked in at 5:30 on a Wednesday evening. There were no open tables, but the waitress let us sit at a table that was reserved until the group showed up at 6:00. After that, she led us to a table that she has saved for us in the meantime. \n\nYou have to reserve the bocce ball court and I believe there is a $100 minimum which shouldn't be an issue if you have enough people.", "author": "Taylor F."}

I will say the ambience by itself deserves five stars. The service was pretty good too, but the wine and food were just okay and being that this is a wine venue, I just can't bring myself to give it four stars. \n\nI do like that it lives up to its name in the sense that it is hidden down a dark alley so you feel a certain joy in finding it, like a secret cave. \n\nWe ordered a \"comparison\" flight which consists of 2  3 oz pours. We ordered the two Syrah/shiraz reds, one from Australia and one from the states. The Australian one was alright, but the American one was barely drinkable.\n\nI also ordered the wild mushroom flatbread which was just meh. \n\nAlso to note, they have a bocce ball set up on their side patio which I thought looked fun. \n\nOverall, though, probably not a return venue for me next time I'm in San Fran.", "author": "Katie W."}

Everything we ordered we absolutely loved. The wine itself was amazing as well -- we went with whites, reds, and rose just to ensure everyone had something that fit their palette.

I knew that my wife wouldn't be flying in until after 1am and, by the time she got from the airport to downtown, it would likely be 2.  Kitchens long closed, last call called.    \n\nAnd the lady likes bubbly....\n\nSo, I hit up Hidden Vine and grabbed a bottle of French champagne and a couple of flat breads take back to the room and store in our mini-fridge while awaiting her arrival.  Remarkably, after selecting my bottle \"to-go\", I was informed that it was 30% off since I wouldn't be drinking it in the restaurant.    Fantastic!   The flatbreads were pricey and since they immediately got put in the fridge, I can only say that they weren't half bad when they got reheated 3 hours later.   \n\nThe bartender was attentive and fun, the place was alive and hopping, and the glass of pinot I had while waiting on the flatbreads was delicious.   While I wasn't paying much attention to the crowd, it definitely struck me as upscale.  \n\nBy the time my love got in, Hidden Vine was closed, so boy did I score major points by surprising her with that bottle of France' finest and some tasty treats ;) \n\nI look forward to checking the place out again, hopefully together, next time SF is the destination....", "author": "Scott M."}

I did a quick Yelp search and Hidden Vine came up. I wanted to keep it tame and wine sounded good, so Peter L and I stopped by on Wednesday, March 1st around 7:45pm. There were a few tables open, so we grabbed a two top along the wall.\n\nFlights: 3 x 2oz servings of wines\n*Big and Bold: Shiraz, Tempranillo, Syrah Blend ($14)\n*Southern Hemisphere: Uruguay, Brazil, Chile ($14)\n\nWe decided to try both red wine flights. I like big, bold wines, so I drank most of that one. I can't really recall which one I liked the best, but we did a side by side comparison. I think I liked my first pour and Peter's second pour. (Or it could have been vice versa.) For the last pour, I can't remember which one was better.  Maybe my palate was blown by then? Either way, I did enjoy the flights and it was a great way to sample six different wines.\n\nI adored the laid back vibe of this wine bar. It's kind of hidden away in an alley, so it wasn't too busy. Or maybe because it was a Wednesday night? They have various tables scattered in the center with comfy couches and chairs as well as a small bar in the back. I could see myself enjoying some wine and having a good conversation with a friend or two. They also have a what I think is a small bocce ball set up to the left of the space.\n\nNice bar to enjoy some wine while catching up with a friend.

The table we sat had hidden notes someone stashed into the brick wall. It was a cool lounge atmosphere with low lights. We happened to find the only open table where a server named Dace welcomed us. We were then asked by another waitress who's name we didn't get, which we should have because she was very rude. We ordered our first two glasses of wine which took a while, but Dace was very kind and offered the two glasses to us. For the food the waitress came the first time and we were not ready, she seemed a bit irate. When we did make our food order everything was fine, my female friend received her cheese plate just fine, but a very long time passed, we were done with the cheese plate, and we finally asked Dace about the crab cakes we ordered. He rushed to find the waitress who took our order, and she seemed to brush him off a bit, some time late the crab cakes came out. I would give this place 3 stars because of the waitress alone, but Dace made our experience one that made us want to come back again. So our 5 stars goes out to Dace for being awesome, the place was awesome, the flights of wine were great, so we'll be back, but we'll probably have to ask for a different waitress next time.", "author": "wayz W."}

We did the Rainbow Chard and White Bean burger with no bun which was as one would have guessed, good enough but not like a real hamburger haha. The Burrata, balsamic-black pepper strawberries, and Speck on toasted Acme Crostini was really good, probably my favorite.

The Hidden Vine touts itself as more of a a ine bar and has a nice selection of tasting flights as well as wine by the glass. \n\nATMOSPHERE:  At first look, it is a nice, classy place with dim romantic mood lighting. Although we came in on a Wednesday night though, it was packed, clearly showing how popular it was. \n\nBAD: While I really liked the look and feel of the place, the space was way too cramped. For some reason, people would just randomly stand around in between tables chatting. Sometimes they would pack so closely to our table, their backs (or butts) kept brushing up against our wine glasses, threatening to tip them over. So that was definitely not one of my favorite parts.\n\nSERVICE: We had really amazing waiters who were very attentive despite the busy night. Our food and wine came instantly and they were so accommodating in trying to help us find wines suited to our palate when we both realized we didn't like most of the wines in the tasting flight. Lastly, our server was incredibly sweet - after realizing we had been squashed in a corner by the patrons milling around, he gave us a glass of complimentary wine to make up for the experience. So definitely lots of brownie points for service!\n\nFOOD: UM, INCREDIBLE. We ordered the prosciutto flat bread which was crispy and delicious. And the cheese, gah, to die for. We also had the burrata which honestly was the highlight of my meal, and I don't even like burrata. The cheese was so creamy, light and delicious, and paired perfectly with the prosciutto, pear and crispy bread. A DEFINITE must order!! Will 100% come back just for the burrata.\n\nWINE: I love wine but didn't love any of my selections for the night, and apparently neither did Julie Z who ordered a tasting flight of cabs and complained they tasted like cheap $2 wine. Unfortunately, I felt the same about my flight of Oregon wines which all had a strong \"plasticky\" smell and taste. The only saving grace of the night was my glass of Californian chardonnay which was delicious but not mindblowing. Disappoint.\n\nAll in all, the Hidden Vine is a nice place to hang out while you're in the city. It definitely wasn't one of my favorite places because of the crowdedness, the noise level and the disappointing wines, but man, that burrata. I would cross oceans to have it again.", "author": "Sarah T."}

The seats are plenty and comfortable, the staff are friendly and helpful when it comes to choosing beverages, and the ambience is romantic and cozy like a winter's cabin complete with \"fire\"place. To be honest, I'm not a wine person but when you're in a wine bar you have wine! So, since I couldn't commit to a whole glass I chose a flight; this is always a good choice for me. What I was really there for were the sliders (well, that and my friend's birthday ;). We tried the pulled pork and beef sliders (they had run out of the shrimp). Sliders come two to an order.

To reserve a small standing room area and the bocce ball area (YES BOCCE BALL!!) you'll have to call ahead of time and I believe theres a minimum food and drink charge of $100.  That won't be hard however because the food is more on the pricey side for hors d'oeuvre.  \n\nThis wine bar is so cozy and intimate.  It has a fireplace and some comfy sitting areas including couches.  And the interior is dark and quiet.  We came on a Monday night so maybe it would be more lively on a Friday.  \n\nThe food was amazing! Lamb burger sliders, mushroom flatbread pizza, garlic puff pastry bundles, prosciutto and duck flatbread (if I remember correctly).  All amazing and the woman who served our group (sadly don't remember her name) was so friendly and accomodating.  She explained the wine selection at least ten times to us because we came in staggers in groups.  \n\nAnd don't worry I haven't forgotten to include the bocce ball area!

I asked for a taste of an expensive Pinot noir before committing to its price tag. It got poured and the bartender left the rest of the bottle out with it but then promptly disappeared somewhere. I DID love the wine but couldn't tell if I was now supposed to pour myself the rest of the bottle. Plus, what if I didn't like that wine and wanted to try something else? There were some other bartenders wandering in and out from behind the bar who paid no attention to me, and I finally spotted MY bartender socializing at a table in the room. She finally returned and I STILL had trouble getting her attention, but she completely apologized once I did -- \"oh my God, I just completely ignored you, how terrible of me.\" The wine was so good and the atmosphere was so elegant and soothing and I was having a good time anyway, so it wasn't that big a deal -- but I do hope for more attentive service next time.", "author": "Sheri W."}

I'm not expert wino who drinks $150 wines regularly or anything (which I felt the staff didn't mind reminding me). I enjoy wine and wine tasting though so take that for what it is. The wine list isn't extensive but it is well-curated. One thing that surprised me was that there were not that many California wines. When I'm in California, I want California wines. I did notice an interesting comparison flight of a Napa vs. French red. \n\nI decided on the Big and Bold wine flight that included a set of mostly South American Teran, Shiraz and Malbec wines. The wines were big and bold but I would have liked a little more education on them. My favorite was probably the Teran. I also would have liked the flights to list the details of each wine next to it as opposed to having to flip to the other side to try to dig it out of the single glass list.\n\nI also noticed there's no food menu here. I noticed that some reviews and the website includes food but I was not offered any- maybe because it was 11pm? I would have liked some water crackers or something to nibble on between wines. \n\nThe ambience here is lovely and perfect for a date. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time here.

Last week when were were there, I tried the Savingnon Blanc flight, which was a comparison of wines from CA, New Zealand, and France.  It was interesting to compare side by side.  \n\nBoth times we've stopped in here after work, it's been very busy (both times it was Friday around 6PM, so no surprise that it was busy, particularly given its location).  This past time we were at least lucky enough to grab two stools along the side wall closer to the kitchen/bathrooms.  The ambiance is better in the main area (more dimly lit, more comfortable chairs) if you're willing to wait.  \n\nWe also have tried some of their food options - the first time we tried the sliders, which were delicious.  This past time we ordered the warm citrus olives and burrata plate.  Oh my goodness, both were a delight.

My brother who knows all about hard liquor and nothing about wine just said, \"pick something cold for me!\"  I think he liked the 2009 Riesling from the Willamette Valley in Oregon, but what he REALLY loved were the XOX truffles.

Atmosphere is \"casual intimate\" - cozy enough for 1:1 conversation and welcoming to groups.

Comfy chairs, a really cozy couch in one corner, and a large (somewhat segregated) communal table, which large parties can often usurp.  Exposed brick and wooden beams = can i move in? Tends to get loud though.\n\nWine/bites: I had two glasses of an amazing off-dry Riesling that our waiter recommended. $9 a glass.  I also tried my co-worker's rose bubbly and it was actually really nice, and not too sweet.  We also ordered two different types of cheeses - an Italian sheep's milk and one with truffles - and they were both really tasty.  Cheese came with fresh bread, almonds and fruit jam (apricot?).  They also offer other nibbles like flatbreads and marinated olives.  \n\nService: spotty.  The gentleman that first helped us was affable and knowledgeable.

For $9 you get a pretty sizable pour of both options too! We also ordered the mushroom flatbread - delicious!

We had some time to kill before the husband's company party so we looked for wine bars in the general area and this one popped up.  GPS led us on a short trek that ended in a really sketchy alley with an overflowing dumpster and a huge truck blocking, like, everything.  I thought we were gonna get shanked or something....but then we rounded the dumpster, passed some Eastern European caf\u00e9, and finally spotted the entrance.  \n\nThe Hidden Vine was indeed hidden, but once we were inside, the contrast made it worth the search.  It's set up like someone's Mad Men den, with deep chairs in clusters around low tables, a fireplace, and a couple high-tops with comfy-looking bar chairs.  You could be wearing a smoking jacket like Hugh Hefner and feel totally at home.  We decided to sit at the bar though because service would be faster that way.  The wine list isn't as extensive as I'd hoped (okay, when we looked online ahead of time I spotted a Ripasso that I had my heart set on but it wasn't available when we arrived...so that's not fair, the wine list is actually pretty comprehensive, I'm just being butthurt).  Lots of whites and reds (and two roses) divided up between old world and new world, with some surprising ones I'd never even heard of and certainly couldn't pronounce.  Several snacks are available including crab sliders but we'd already eaten so I guess we'll have to come back again to check that all out.  Service was prompt and courteous, and prices were reasonable for everything.

I was looking for a bar near the Embarcadero to have a Meetup for the opening of BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD. So I searched for places in the area and Google searched bars. I saw the Hidden Vine listed and figured I'd take a shot. I was a little hesitant because some places immediately start acting funny when I mention the International Black Women's Film Festival --they think \"Uh-oh. Black people! I bet they're going to be pouring champagne on each other and doing booty dances on the table.\" Needless to say, my experiences with some venues/bars in the Bay Area have been hit-or-miss. \n\nEmailed and called the place to reserve the \"groups\" area which is really a little spot tucked off the main entrance with a beautiful Spanish style table. The initial interaction was smoother and more professional than I'd experienced in some time. They weren't pushing for payment on the first contact, but they spelled out the terms, confirmed what I needed and set a reasonable price. With that, I was glad to pay. There was no \"funny stuff\" like special stipulations that only apply to \"special\" groups, you know, like we need you to bring CASH or a CASHIER'S CHECK right now --no exceptions.\n\nThey were genuinely professional. Got to the place the day off, and like all of my events, the group was diverse in ages, races and looks --that to say that you never know how you or your guests are going to be treated, because apparently some bar/restaurant/venue staff were raised in cloistered convents and have never seen different kinds of people before.\n\nThere was a designated staff person who was professional, courteous and attentive, and all business around the reservation was handled out of ear shot of the guests, specifically things like double-checking what was ordered, how I wanted the service timed, etc. FANTASTIC!\n\nThe wine was amazing and guests were truly impressed by the place. No one was made to feel that they didn't belong, there were no side-eyes, no suspiciously frequent \"check-ins\", no rude treatment, etc. It was nothing but professional service, attention to hospitality and great wine.\n\nThey didn't even get nervous when Mardi Gras beads came out, or when the producer of BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD, Josh Penn, stopped by as the guest of honor. \n\nI love this place and I highly recommend it. I've been recommending it to people at my job, film industry professionals, et al., because they deserve the accolades. Oh, and they have THE BEST wine glasses I've seen in quite some time. Classy with a \"c\". No posers, obnoxious hipsters or socially stunted techies because they definitely set the bar high on what is acceptable behavior at this place!\n\nCheers to the Hidden Vine Wine Bar!", "author": "Adrienne A."}

I like the ambiance, it is as if you are walking into someone's living room.  I got there before my friend so I sat in the chairs by the fireplace.  The prices of the wines do tend to get a bit pricey, however I like that they offer flights so that you can have a taste of a variety.  Plus the tastings are generous which is helpful.  It takes about 3 sips of wine to really get the true flavors of the wine.   I loved the Argentina Malbec wines.  \n\nMy only complaint is there was a party sitting next to me with a baby that cried.  I just don't think that was the place to bring a baby, let alone a child.\n\nA very inviting and intimate place tucked away in a small alley street.

I know Jonathan Gold complains that San Francisco is \"shuddering through its mannerist phase,\" but sometimes it pays off. Here you can get a venison rillette with a selection of cold Portuguese whites, and it's glorious.\n\nOn a mid-week afternoon, the interior buzzes with boisterous office workers and canoodling couples. It can get a bit loud and crowded, yet remains polite. With the exception of a enormous tapestry in the front room, the decor is a bit spare. But they've got bocce ball outside (or something resembling it), so all is forgiven.\n\nFor quality wine, it's also quite affordable. They have whites beginning at $7 a glass and the pours are generous. Staff is well-informed and friendly, while its unusual location keeps out the tourists.

There are a few beer selections available as well for those who aren't wino's.\n\nWe were doing some afternoon drinking and opted for 2 CA whites that were great, and the wait staff serviced them to us out on the patio - even bringing us our glasses straight to the court, as to not disturb our intense game!\n\nI have also been here for post-work drinks, and the service was excellent - especially for how busy it was.", "author": "Nic S."}

You feel like you are in the comforts of your own home or a cottage out in the countryside with your friends. They have a lot of comfortable couches for people to lounge in, a room with a round table for larger groups, and an outside area when it's not too cold. \n\nThis is definitely one of those classssssy places. The crowd is a bit older than the rowdier bars.  I'd say average age range is like 30-35+. This is a more intimate setting if you're looking for that.

I really enjoyed doing their tasting flight, where they tagged each glass with the name of the wine, so you know what you are drinking.  \n\nDECOR:  Classic rustic look.

It is definately hidden in a small alleyway called Cosmo Pl.  \n\nCareful entering here.  At night the entrance is extremely dark and once you step in, the platform is narrow and the stairs are steep.  If you've been tipping the glass already, be careful not to hurt youself.  You've been warned.  For those less adventerous, you can enter via Post Street through the Fitzgerald Hotel.  But you'll just experience the vine, not the hidden.\n\nOff Cosmo Pl., you descend into a very cozy living room.  Dark and mysterious.  As if you've intruded Oscar Wilde's flat.  Seat yourself and prepare for a treat.  Wines are impressive and intriguing.\n\nAfter our initial Portuguese and Spanish flirtation, we ordered a flight of beautiful Italian reds.  Cutely hand labeled to pick your poison.  Nice balance and progression.  I loved them all (go figure).  Cheese plate ample and took the edge off before dinner an hour later.  Place was emptying out and we vowed to return later that night, however another wine bar got our last call.\n\nCannot wait to return to this secret and seculded slice of seduction off Cosmo Place.  Not to be missed if you're in the area.", "author": "Kalani C."}

The ambiance is fantastic, with a fireplace and beautiful lighting, and it's one of those rare bars where you can actually hear what the members in your party are saying. But when the service is so incredibly poor, it overshadows everything else. \n\nI get having a bad day as a server, but the woman who attended to our group last night was straight-up rude. Before I even arrived, my friend who arrived first wanted to let the server know that there would be more people coming. All she had a chance to say was, \"I have some friends-\" before the server cut her off, snapping, \"We don't do that here. They'll just have to watch.\" What?\n\nOnce we arrived, it took a good 15 minutes to order our wine. It took three more attempts to get some water for the table and two pleas for the check before it came. We had also ordered a bottle of sparkling wine for the table, and when the server came to finish pouring the remainder, she poured the entire rest of the bottle into my glass and a dribble into one other glass, ignoring the other three women whose glasses were also dry.\n\nWas it the worst night of my life?

And the pours were also generous... a good way to start off your evening, for sure!\n\nThe overall experience here was just OK. I came with a group of 6 ladies on a time crunch and this is not a \"quick in and out\" kind of place (ha! I know, \"that's what she said\"). Andrea R was right when she said it would be good for a date - as it's better suited for two, maybe three or four people in a group, max. \n\nOur server was extremely knowledgeable about the wines he served and was slightly irked when we were not as passionate/interested about what we were saying as he was. But again, I don't think he intended to come off that way. The guy just gets serious about his vino. Noted! \n\nSince I usually come to San Francisco for work (usually in groups of 5 or more people), I doubt I'll be back here soon.

There was one group of about ten people in one corner and we were three expecting four more. After we told the hostess that we did not have a reservation, she begrudgingly and condescendingly told us that we should make a reservation next time because \"(they) get very busy on weeknights.\" In case it wasn't clear, that is not how one speaks if you want your paying customers to feel welcome and to establish repeat business. \n\nOf course, several plates of food and 6+ bottles of wine later, the female servers were much nicer to us. And the offerings are not what one would consider \"cheap\". It is worth mentioning that there was one tall male server who was gracious and attentive to our concerns, especially as we had a couple food allergies in the group.

The food was delicious, but it'll cost you a pretty penny! Who set the price target on this place at $$??? TRY $$$ and you'll not be surprised when you get your bill. I cannot believe I paid $7 for the smallest wedge of bri and another $7 for the thinnest slices of salami I've ever seen. All in all, the two of us managed to spend $180 and we walked out of there feeling pretty sober and hungry. The pours are some of the smallest I've seen - especially the flights. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $14 for a flight, it should at least total a glass of wine. How they make it seem like it does total a regular glass? They give you smaller glasses than the glasses they give you if you order a single glass (I compared to my gf who opted for the glass and not the flight). After my mistake of ordering the flight, I quickly changed to just ordering a glass of Zin (for the same price) and felt like I actually received a glass of wine. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I have NO problem paying for good wine and food, but when you spend $180 and walk out feeling hungry and sober, there's a problem. I guess you're paying for the location and not the food/drinks/service. There are far too many other wine bars in the city that I'd rather check out/revisit than to go back here (even though my office is a block away).

Here's why:\n\n1) They do NOT offer a comp cheese plate on Thursday per their website: http://www.thehiddenvine.com/events.shtml \"Ongoing Events\nJoin us for our weekly complimentary cheese board, Thursdays from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.\". Server informed us they haven't done that at least since he started in January\n\n2) They do NOT have the following on the menu to order: Miller Farms Olive Oil & Garlic Roasted Walnuts or Five Star Chocolate Truffles\nhttp://www.thehiddenvine.com/menu.shtml. This menu is online & posted at bar entrance. Again, server said they haven't had those since he started there. \n\n3) They do NOT offer \"Flights of the Month\" per their website: http://www.thehiddenvine.com/events.shtml. \n\n4) The cheese plate was so-so. 2 choices for $12 with ~10 tiny bread slices & a small souffle cup of chutney. The cuts of cheese probably range between 1.5-2 oz each so ok for 2 people to split but you're still hungry after. \n\n5) And since we were still hungry, we got the Wild Boar salami which also came w/ some sliced bread (which is what we were after). The salami had a good flavor & good marbling but it was severly cold and hard. It was more like eating jerky than salami which threw off the texture. \n\nBoth did comparisons.\n1st: Sav Blanc comparison for both of us. They were OK, nothing spectacular & I'd never buy a full bottle of either. \n2nd: I did Zin comparison & my friend did Pinot comparisons. Again, only OK wines. \nServer seemed to be knowledgeable about the wines but we didn't ask too many questions. He did acknowledge that it was embarrassing the website & outdoor menu were so blatantly off & not at all updated.\n\nThe interior is eclectic/funky & music plays in the background. Very dark so when you come in from the outside, your eyes have to adjust to the lighting & it's a flight of stairs down so hold on to the handrail! At least our couches were comfy to sit on!\n\nI'll check out other wine bars before I go back here. Glad we had a Groupon for this.", "author": "Marissa H."}

The first time I went on a date (early last month).  The second time this past Thursday with a friend.  The third time this past Friday with a friend where we had good wine, cheese and some bread with honey.  Man, the snacks were awesome.\n\nWhy is it I like this place a lot?  Well, it's a very chill atmosphere inside and the service, wine and food seem to go with it.  Just think of yourself relaxing at a nice hotel in Carmel, California where everything is tranquilized and drama is down.  That's what the Hidden Vine is like.  The ambiance was good as well.  Hell, it's a perfect place for working professionals to mingle, dating and meeting new people in general.  There's a nice outdoor area to get some air.  Pretty unique venue considering it's sandwiched in the alley of Merchant right next to Battery.\n\nTo someone who had pointed out that the hostess was rude at Hidden Vine, nope, not in my experience.  The offerings not cheap?  This is San Francisco folks.  GET USED TO IT.  We aren't a third world country.  There are a lot worse venues than the Hidden Vine so if you go ahead and criticize it, you might as well criticize the city of Carmel.\n\nAnd yes, if someone at Hidden Vine tells you you should make reservations next time, it's because they are trying to be fair to other customers.  You don't like it, go someplace else.  I chose to continue going to the Hidden Vine and I'll refer all my friends and colleagues to go there.  I'm even working on organizing a networking event myself there as a matter of fact and managed to get the contact information of the events coordinator at the Hidden Vine, as well as additional information regarding event organization, pricing, head count, etc.  All this was because I guess I'm smooth but some reviewers here need to learn some people communication skills.\n\nAnyway, have fun with the Hidden Vine.

Portions are generous and reasonably priced and I loved that each glass of wine comes with a label so that you can 1) remember what the heck your drinking, and 2) if you like it, you can remove the label and haul ass to the nearest BevMo for more.\n\nMy friends did a variety of dessert wines, while I choose a flight of reds from the featured region of the month: Israel and Lebanon.  Two of the wines were from Yarden, a winery that I just happened to visit while in the far north of Israel a couple years ago.  Ah, memories.

I had two guests from France stay with me and they wanted to try California wine so I yelped 'wine bars' and decided to try Hidden Vine.\n\nWe got there around 10:20pm and the woman at the bar apologised but said that she would have to close early because the closer didn't come and she needed to catch the Bart.  So that left us with 30 minutes to chug down $10 - $14 glasses of wine.  We could have easily gone elsewhere but we had walked a good amount of blocks to get there so that was a bit of a bummer.\n\nI had a sparkling rose wine for $7.  I picked the cheapest glass of the menu because i know the Frenchies were going to pay.  They both ordered two glasses of California wine and weren't impressed.  They used words like 'strong' to describe them.  They could have just been picky also, but for $37 it wasn't worth it.  \n\nAlso my fourth friend ordered water and it never came.  The server seemed a little put out that he ordered water and not wine.", "author": "Walerz B."}

Think \"organic wines\" of 10 years ago, prior to biodynamic.  They were interesting... \n\n2007 Fairhills Malbec from South Africa (round and fruity front with earthy dirt lingering)\n2008 Fairhills Merlot from Argentina (sweet and playfully fruity)\n2008 Fairhills Cabernet from South Africa (big... tannins were light even though it tasted like a shale cliff from the desert.  I really liked it but \"earth\" is the word in every sense.\n\nThat tasting was $8. That's insane.  They were not special wines, nor were they something I would have ever a) bought or b) tasted...... but they were certainly worthy of a tasting, and at $8 that is ASTONISHING.\n\nThen I graduated myself (complete applause) to a bubbly \"VS\" from the menu that is pretty smart.  It's a smaller tasting in general for the client - but it's also less stock, less labor, and easier to mark up.  The price was a completely fair - I think it was $16, but it could have been cheaper.  The VS is a fun idea.... Two instead of three.... a head to head experience.\n\nNV Tenuta di Collalbrigo Prosecco Ros\u00e9 Veneto, Italy \nvs.\nMV Bailly-Lapierre Brut, 'Exception' Cremant de Bourgogne Burgundy (is that right?)\n\nI like bubbly. I quite enjoyed both, but I don't think the Prosecco was a fresh bottle.  I guess it's always okay to ask?  I don't know... now I am rambling. Isn't that quaint.\n\nIn the end, for a well situated amble towards dinner, we were rosy and pleasured at no more than $29 total before tip.  That's fairly cool for a wine bar.\n\nQuite enjoyed.", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

Their wine flights are hit and miss.  It's hard to screw up reds, but the whites, Rieslings and the sparkling wines were very inconsistent.  It'd have been useful to know that two of the three Rieslings were so sweet that a reviewer would have mentioned notes of Gatorade.  They also offer a cheese plate, and for $12 you get 4 tiny slivers of cheese, adding further insult.\n\nIt is a really nice place inside, the atmosphere and decor are fantastic - but as others have mentioned, this is the work of the original owners who loved their wines and established the business.  All that remains are nice couches, and if you don't really care what your booze tastes like, I suppose this is the place for you.", "author": "Scott S."}

Maybe they should change the name to The Out In The Open Vine. \n\nBelieve it or not, it is kinda hidden. You can either enter it from an alley near Le Colonial or through a hotel lobby in which it is located. And it's not the nicest hotel lobby either so I entered the wine bar with a bit of trepidation. Which dissipated instantly. It's old school gorgeous in there. Very warm and inviting. We sat in some of the most comfortable chairs. The kind that you just kinda fall into. \n\nWe were there early and had the whole joint to ourselves for a bit. The waiter/ sommelier took his time going over the menu with us and he was incredibly knowledgeable. It almost felt like a mini-class on wines and regions. I enjoyed this immensely. \n\nWine was ordered. A flight for the lady. A red for myself. I expressed my likes: reds, earthy, bold. The wine delivered was just what I wanted. The three glasses in the flights came with name tags on the bottom so you could distinguish between each. Fantastic idea. More wine bars should do this. \n\nSo the spot was empty and lo and behold, in walks a group of sorority girls who decide to take up the table next to us for their seven year reunion. Every single chair/table was empty and they sit next to the couple in the corner involved in a quiet intimate discussion. Who does that? Therefore we had to overcome their high pitched yelping about beemers and their boyfriends Chad til we left.... this is why I don't own a gun. \n\nThey say the music soothes the savage beast and they are right, if it wasn't for Wilco playing over the speakers their reunion would have had a different outcome. It wasn't just the music, it was the wine and the fantastic cheese selections that came with ample amounts of bread and the olives which were finger-licking tasty. \n\nMy only complaint was that I puled an amateur move in drinking wine. I went from bold to light for my second glass. I zigged when I should have zagged. That was completely my fault and I don't hold our waiter responsible.... although he should have scoffed at me like a true oenophile and maybe I would have made a better choice.

The owners are an awesome couple and they have  very lovingly built their business up since opening a few years ago. Hidden Vine is kind of a cross between Lovejoy's Tearoom and Yield wine bar, decor-wise. They've done away with a lot of the schlocky decorative items that were there when they first opened (think plastic flowers) but some schlock remains, toned down by the shadowy, romantic lighting.\n\nI prefer Cav and Biron only because I they're more my scene- more industrial, less victorian front room. Hidden Vine is a great wine bar for when you want to feel like you're drinking at home without really drinking at home.

The front page of the menu is filled with flights and side-by-side comparisons. For the head-to-heads, you're served glasses with generous pours and labels facing down. Sorry, but anything conducive to my playing a game solo is a winner in my book.\n\nSo ...\n\nTake a group of friends wanting to learn more about wines by tasting them in a pleasant atmosphere. Or take your special someone down the steps from Cosmo Alley (where, just a few steps down, you'll find the famed Le Colonial) and stake out a cushioned cubby hole of your own. Drink down your wine and remember that you're in one of the best places to do what you're doing, in one of the best cities for the same.", "author": "Jeff H."}

Even though I wasn't on a date, I enjoyed myself. The service was amazing. I arrived early and it was cold so I decided to steal a nook to wait for my friend, completely hidden from view upon entering. He kept an eye out for my friend as I waited gingerly by myself in the dark. Aside from that, there was cheese, charcuterie, and olive platters along with bread that you help yourself to while you tasted the wine. \n\nI had the European flight tasting, consisted of three types of wine. One from Italy, one from Spain, and one from somewhere I can't recall. I am not a wine snob by any means, but I know what I like when it goes in my mouth. All three of the wines were really good, but the last one was so complex that each sip tasted completely different. As the evening came to a close, we informed a waitress, who turned out to be an owner of the place, that we loved one of the wines. She brought out a Californian version of it on the house since we enjoyed it so much. She also suggested places to purchase the wine that we so dearly enjoyed. And they have the wines with handwritten coasters so you can take them home! \n\nSidenote: the place has a monthly change on their tastings, so I guess I'll have to go back every month.

If you go past the hotel and make a left around the corner and head down the little alleyway to the valet parking behind the building, you'll find the long staircase that leads down to this plush find.

I sat down on the cushy sofa in the corner, chatted with the super-friendly owner/bartendress and ordered a generously poured Red at her recommendation, and kept myself occupied building houses out of proscuitto.  And they were impressively structurally sound houses, given that they were made out of glorified lunch meat.\n\nSo as I'm sipping and constructing, an older, obviously inebriated gentleman walked in and sat down next to a group of 20-somethings at the bar.  I wasn't too far away, so I caught bits and pieces of their conversation.  He made baudy jokes; they laughed, and I tried to hide my smirks.  I guess I did a pretty poor job of that, though, as he caught my eye.  What follows is verbatim:\n\n\"HELLO young lady, and what brings you here all alone tonight?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm just having a glass of wine before my friends arrive.\"\n\n\"Really?  I'm drinking scotch.

I walked in and the place smelled like wine in a way I'd expect an opium den to smell like opium. It is essentially a tiny room with a tiny bar that somehow manages to fit several tables together in a very spaceous arrangement that doesnt make it cramped at all. It had this bohemian innocence that would have reminded me of Paris, if I had ever been there.\n\nWe orded the southern italian flight and got to taste some great wine. Our favorites among the whites were the greco and the fiona, and amongst the red we liked the dragone rosso. I'm not really into wine so I won't go into them because I'm sure I'll get schooled by someone who takes it much more seriously than me.\n\nWe really enjoyed the cheeses as well. Our favorite was the Cypress Grove goat cheese, that came with fig chutney and some bread. Damnit, just writing about it makes me want to go back there and get some more. It reminded me of the goat cheese appetizer at Baraka, it had the same complementary flavors. It's really good. Check it out.\n\nOverall a great time. A perfect happy hour spot to pick to catch up on the times with an old friend, or kick off a romantic date with a special someone.\n\nUPDATE: If you find yourself here and looking for an amazing glass of wine, get the Sequoia cabernet. Its a hefty $17/glass but it by far my favorite wine there and totally worth it in my opinion. If you get a glass of this wine and not like it, then I will personally give you $17... in pennies.", "author": "Jonathan H."}

Each glass comes with a ring around it with the name of the wine and the region it is from. Very tasty and very informative!

You have to love a place whose address is 1/2 Cosmo Place. I want a fraction in my address. \n\nFirst off, this place has a speak-easy sort of location, since it is down a back alley. next, you start to question what this place really is once you go down the steep stairs.  You feel like you're going into someone's garden apartment. But once you get down into the main room that is the Hidden Vine, it looks like someone's very cool finished game room, after the TV show \"trading spaces\" got done with it. They've got a mix of different style chairs, all very comfortable in little sitting areas.  My favorite spot is where my wife and I sat: in an ~ 8'- x 6' recess in one of the walls that has a lounge chair on the open end, and a bench back by the wall. \n\nI enjoy wine, but don't know a lot about it, and I was not intimidated by their wine list.  They had an Austrian Seasonal Sampler at that time, and we're still looking for an Austrian St. Laurent wine that we had (very modern looking label, using polka dots in the design).  If that rings a bell with anyone, please drop me a line. \n\nI had the smoked duck breast as well, and it was very good.  This place is worth searching out.", "author": "Jon B."}

On my most recent visit I had 2 flights from  France- one white and one red. Each flight had 3 glasses.  Cost was $10 for the white flight and $18 for the red flight. Both completely worth it! Their pours are very generous and each glass was  excellent. In my experience at wine bars usually a couple of the wines in a flight are not too tasty, but at the Hidden Vine it appears that every glass has been thoughtfully picked out because they are all delicious. \n\nI came here once before for 2 Australian flights, white and red. Total cost for 2 flights of 4 glasses each ( total 8 glasses) was only $20! Again, the wines were ALL delicious!\n\nI like the way they have little tags on the glasses with the name of the wine on each glass- we used them to play a nice game of blind wine tasting..yes admittedly dorky but fun nonetheless!", "author": "amy k."}

I was with a group for my friend's birthday and they put us in the front in an area with a large table and a cool wine tapestry. My only complaint is that they propped the front door open and it was quite chilly.

True to its name, the place is a bit hidden from the main road, but we did enter from the outside entrance and down the stairs.  Service had the hospitality of a multi-generational family establishment - warm, friendly, extremely knowledgeable (I believe she quoted the maker of our wine to be one of the few who did not graduate from UC Davis; I was impressed they keep records of even the educational background of winemakers yet are so unpretentious and fun to talk to).  \n\nThe wine menu is non-connoisseur-friendly for those like myself - each section has the bolded \"type\" of red or white (\"Earthy\", \"Fruity\", \"Bold Tasting\" I can recall were some, with further descriptions per section).  Prices were extremely reasonable, and on Fridays (which is the day we went) they have 20% off bottles.  We ordered a bottle of a \"fruity red,\" a 2003 Niner (I believe a Zinfandel blend) and the hard sheep's and soft goat cheese.  The cheese plates come with dried blueberries, apricots and the seasoned spread, and the thinly sliced bite-sized bread.  I nibbled for hours and ordered more of the hard sheep's milk, which was sparsely studded with peppercorn.   Two cheeses for $12, and each additional was $6, and portions were very decent.\n\nTo me, The Hidden Vine deserves five stars because it is truly charming and memorable.  I feel that with drinking establishments, it's not so much the wine or the food but the fusion of that and more that will give the place a certain necessary \"aura\" to earn five stars.

There is a tasting of different resiling, comparing German resiling with California resiling, comparing various German white and red. \n\nFinally a feature that all wine bar should have!

Starting with whites, the menu is broken down into a spectrum of the lightest whites to the boldest reds.  Perfect for those who are not too sure about regions etc.. but know how they like their wines to taste.\n\nSecond kudos goes to the gentleman serving up the libations- recommended a fabulous cheese to pair with our spicy reds- a nice, creamy burrata with truffle oil and sea salt... yumm.\n\nBest part of the experience was the dark atmosphere with plush, tucked away nooks and krannies for you to sip, eat, and relax with your favorite person.", "author": "Gabrielle J."}

I didn't have the pleasure of visiting under the old owners, but the new owners seem to have done just fine. My friend and I were on a wine mission last Saturday, we wanted something low key where we could hang out, talk sex, guys, relationships, not be bothered, have good reasonable priced drinks, and just enjoy ourselves. \n\nThe Hidden Vine was an excellent choice! We sat at the bar where Chad talked to us about the flights, and his favorites as well as other customer favorites. I chose the flight of whites and my friend got the flight of reds. I am normally not a Riesling type so I tend not to order them, but Chad insisted that I wouldn't regret it and boy was he right. I LOVED it. After my flight I ordered a glass of it. My friend had nothing but great things to say about the reds, and even took home the little paper rings they put on the glasses to tell you what you're drinking. \n\nI love how you feel like you are hanging out in a good friends living room. The couches are cozy, the lighting is cozy, the music is light and nice. I saw a lot of couple and double dates, a few girls hanging out with friends. It got crowded around 10:30 p.m. so I was glad we got there and snagged 2 of the 3 bar seats. Jared (the other bartender) is cute and stuck up for my love of ACDC, Led Zep, and Black Sabbath - I am sure Camille and I's conversation was completely telling at some point, but he didn't let on that he was thinking what sluts we were in college! 2 points! \n\nI will be back with my other 2 best friends when I get them to come visit me!

To add insult to the whole experience they built in a charge of 20% because we had a party of 6, now generally I would have no problem with this except I should have gotten the 20% since i ended up going to the bar 1) to get the bottle list 2) to order a bottle of wine 3) to get more glasses and 4) to find the check--in the course of about 45 minutes.

It's not just me... how do you think Beer Pong became so popular?  Why do you think the basketball game at Mauna Loa always has a line?  The crowd around the pool tables at Savoy and Fly Bar?  The dart board at Black Horse Deli?  Drinking and games go so well together.  Sometimes, though, you need to feel more like an adult. (huh? what's that?!)\n\nWell, The Hidden Vine has turned drinking games upscale.  Those nights you don't feel like shaking your tailfeathers across the alley at Le Colonial, cross the street and go down the itty bitty steep staircase.  In the tiny basement of the Fitzgerald Hotel sits the friendliest litte wine bar that ever was.  The menu changes to focus on different regions, and thus offers various flights from that region.  Our party of 5 sampled a flight of whites from Loire, France, and noshed on some tasty cheese, baguette, and fig ginger compote (!) before the games began...\n\nBy games, I mean the grownup kind.  The Hidden Vine offers comparisons of wines and champagnes.  My boyfriend and I guessed the French vs. California Brut Rose correctly.  This is the only time I would have been okay losing because that would have meant another try (\"can we order another pleeeeease?\")\n\nThe staff was super friendly, not at all snobby like I feared at a wine bar.

I had business in Walnut Creek, CA this past Friday (2/23/07), and it just so happens that I have a few friends that live in the Bay Area, so I was able to spend my first weekend in San Fran. I have been getting into wine lately, and wanted to come up with a place that even my guests hadn't been to. Of course when searching for wine bars, The Hidden Vine came up.\n\nThis place is absolutely awesome. The laid back staff are in t-shirts (the girl working there that night happened to be in a brown Yelp t-shirt), and everyone there is extremely helpful and knowledgeable about wine. We ended up wanting to do reds that night, and they suggested two bottles that were absolutely amazing. In fact, the first one we had I actually wrote down. It was the Chateau de Segries, Rhone Valley, France. I definitely gotta find it again back home on the east coast.\n\nIf you have a largish party, try and get in this place a bit early. Perhaps before 10:00pm. I was with a group of four, and we were there for 15 min or so before a group got up and we literally pounced on the tiny table.\n\nOverall, I definitely expect to be back in San Fran in the next few months, and while I will constantly be trying new things, I intend on visiting my new favorite wine bar.", "author": "Timothy A."}

But once I was inside, I couldn't bring myself to leave! I came in by myself to kill some time and sample a wine flight before heading to another bar to meet some friends. The atmosphere could be described as similar to, if such a thing exists, a Grandma's Dungeon. The lights are kept low, but comfy couches and chairs in olive green and brown tones abound. Lot's of places to sit with 3 or 4 friends and get cozy 'n tipsy. Not like wine bars in the Marina where you need to sit up straight and behave. This place is relaxed, yet manages to remain classy.\nSarah, my bartender for the evening, was exceedingly knowledgeable as a certified sommelier. She was not, however, overwhelming or condescending in any way with her advice and recommendations. She realizes that not everyone knows the difference between Syrah and Petit Sirah, and keeps that in mind when speaking with her customers. Since the bar was pretty quiet this particular Wednesday night, we got to talking and I told her that I was in the process of studying wine for my job as a server/bartender. Her response was to present me with the most amazing blind taste test / information session I could have ever imagined. I learned more in that one night than in any wine class I've ever taken! I'm going back tonight for more - I just can't stay away!", "author": "Tanya K."}

The place is somewhat difficult to find -- it's tucked in an alleyway behind a hotel.  When you walk in the door, you immediately walk down a flight of stairs to a room that looks like it belongs on the Titanic.  Plush velvet chairs, candles, warmly painted walls -- and all really crammed into a fairly small and low room with pillars holding up the ceiling.\n\nI had a Cab Franc, which was absolutely amazing.  Now, I'm a fan of Cabs in general, but this took it to another level.  Too bad a glass cost what I usually like to pay for a bottle, so I won't be splurging on it often.

I usually like Cabs, and I'm horrible with names which lends to me forgetting which ones I like.\n\nPositive:\nThey have this thing called \"Flights\" and I just love that idea. You basically choose a White Flight or a Red Flight, and they bring you 3 out of the 5 half glasses of white wines or red wines and each month they come from different countries. One month may be Spain, the next, Portugal, France, etc. Then you can order a salami dish, a fruit dish (chocolate covered strawberries), olives, and just munch on these side dishes while you sip on the wines.\n\nThey even put the name, country, and year of the wine on these pieces of circular paper that they put on the bottom of your glasses, so you can take them off and take them home if you want to remember an excellent wine.\n\nAs Shoba D. says in a review below, it is VERY library like, dark environment, and relaxing. The place is sort of small but we've never found a hard time getting a place to sit. Might be because not a ton of people know about this place either.\n\nNegative:\nHmmm small?

Hidden Vine capacity sits somewhere around 30 - 40 and yet, you never feel crowded nor unwelcome. Go figure.\n\nFour of us went to Hidden Vine after reading the rave Yelp reviews. Because there were four of us and no open tables to accommodate,  the owner kindly asked two women sitting at a four-person table if they'd mind moving to a two-person table. They obliged and we were on our way to imbibed merriment.\n\nThe whole experience is refreshing. The owner/waiter takes the time to explain the nuances between each wine within the various tastings and comparisons. Her passion shines through each description.\n\nAnd then the cheese and olives. At a wine bar you often expect the accoutrement of food to seem secondary at best. Here the chew-worthy treats served as a delightful balance to the flavorful wines. We had four of the five cheeses offered and all were tasty. In addition they serve chutney and dried berries. At the end of the evening we opted for the daily selection of truffles: champagne and raspberry. They verged on too rich, yet you had no trouble going back for a second helping.\n\nBottom line, this is the type of establishment memories are made of.

I ordered the South of the Border comparison and both wines were just OK a surprise considering Argentinian Malbecs are almost always at least really good if not great.

When I did return at 7 the place was pretty packed, we had to sit at the side bar and my friend didn't have a seat, but it worked. I ordered the San Luis Obispo Pinot Noir and we shared a flat bread mushroom pizza. My wine was amazing, so amazing that I obviously needed two glasses.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-05-10", "description": "What's the psychology here with yelp?  I don't get it.  Why do I feel the need to tell more people (like there aren't enough already on yelp raving about this place) about such a great find of a wine bar?  It is like What's the Matter with Kansas, right?  Why do I vote at yelp against my interest?  My vote here seemingly serves only to make the Hidden Vine more popular--and I think it is most likely popular enough!  Oh well.  \nSo, the Hidden Vine is one of those places that makes me want to go back to all my prior reviews and adjust my stars so that the 5 I am giving to Hidden Vine is more meaningful.  Everything about the place screamed \"find.\"  \nThe owners are not only incredibly friendly and enjoyable to be around, but also perfectly suited personalities for running a wine bar.  Let me explain.  I love wine--so much so that I have been known to read about it, spend too much time and money collecting it, drink too much of it, and even obsess from time to time.  Is it not the world's most incredible, fascinating and utterly mind-boggling drink?  Plus, it has alcohol in it.  HOME RUN!\nBUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI hate wine assholes.  Like everything in life, some people just need to take it easy.  Other great wine bars in the city (I will not name names) employ people who take wine to a whole new level of seriousness.  I can't deal with the conversations I have with these people, with their intense name-dropping of bottles they have consumed or own, or ridiculous descriptions of the \"cerebral\" nature of the wine.  A great man once said that there is a fine line between clever, and stupid really.  And it's true.  Clever=loving wine and being passionate about it (as it is one of life's greatest things to enjoy), while stupid=being an asshole about it.  \n\nOK--wow I can ramble.  The point is that Angela and David, the owners, are remarkable at walking the line and being clever, not stupid.  They have a great selection of wine.  They will tell you about the wine you are drinking.  They are clearly passionate about it.  They LOVE wine.  And it shows in the space they have created and the personality they have given to it.   The flight of California Pinot and Pinot blends we had last night was very, very well selected and very unique.  That takes love and attention.  \n\nI have been to the Hidden Vine once, last night, for my fiancee's birthday.  In the hour I was there it soared to the top of my list of  go-to places in the city.  It is the type of place that makes you happy to live in San Francisco--the type of place I will look forward to all day.  It is a great combination of a comfortable space, a unique and enticing location, and exceptional proprietors.  \nI can't wait to go back.", "author": "Blake W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-25", "description": "I went here last night with a friend after finding it on Yelp, and had to add my $.02 on the place. First, as they say, timing is everything. We walked in and were lucky to have found a seat on the cozy couch, since all the tables and 'bar seating' were filled. In the time we sat there (about an hour) a lot of people came in - couples, large groups, etc. - and had nowhere to sit, so they left, however, if those groups had come in 30-45 minutes later they would have found plenty of seating. I guess it's better to have a small bar that people have to be turned away from than a large bar that feels empty. You know, the allure of what they are missing.\n\nNow, to the wine and food. The wine selection was really nice. We both prefer sweet white wines and bubbly, so having a choice of sparkling wines and at least 2 different Rieslings was a big selling point for us. The service wasn't bad, since the place was pretty busy. Our waiter was aware of us being there, gave us a sufficient amount of attention as well as a sufficient amount of space. My biggest complaint had to be the food choice/presentation. The picture on their website looks so professional, while what we were given looked far different. The cheese was good, the salami very good, and the olives OK, though there were far more than I have been given at other wine bars, they just weren't that special. The presentation, however, really lacked the professional element I expect from a wine bar that only serves cheese, meats, and olives. The chutney was alright, and paired well with the cheeses. The serving utensil was a regular knife, where a cheese spreader would have been much more compatible with the meal, as well as a small spoon for the chutney. These may seem like fairly nit-picky items, but when out with friends/a significant other/date/spouse, serving should still be relatively simple.\n\nAll-in-all, $50 for 2 glasses of wine, 2 cheese selections, 1 salami, olives, and a few baguettes was a little much for the overall experience. I have had better wine, food, and service at less-trendy places.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

I went to this place for a friend's birthday celebration on a Wednesday night, and it felt like we were in a lovely European inn, where we could get cozy & linger for hours.  Which we did!  I had the Pinot wine flight, and our server was so kind and knowledgeable - and the wines were great, and unusual.  I had 2 more glasses of wine just based on her descriptions which were spot-on. We ordered a selection of cheeses & meats to share, as well as the olives.  All were very good - there was a Mt. Tam, and a cheddar, and a goats' cheese - and paired well with the tomato and cherry chutneys that were on the side.  If they had served more food - we would have stayed all night!  But I also liked the fact that it's limited to drinks and small snacks - otherwise it would surely be overrun with people and not as intimate.  Loved it.  Go with a friend you have not seen in awhile and spend quality catch-up time.\n\nUpdate 12/06:  Enjoyed yet another friend's birthday celebration here, and felt the same warm fuzzy for the place.  Even with our large party, the HV was accommodating and the service was personal.  I had a Rhone wine flight that was delightful, and I especially appreciated the descriptive tags they put on the bottom of each glass.

It's located in this tiny that actually has valet parking and 2 upper class restaurants! We luckily found street parking right away 1 block away. I am so happy I got a Living Social deal for this place or I may had never heard about it! You get to the door and go down carpeted stairs to a dimly and romantically Victorian style room. There are all sorts of nooks and crannies to make oneself cozy in and we chose the coziest of them all with deep cozy seating and tons of pillows. The music is kinds indie which is cool, but some of it was pretty obscure and just odd lyrically. The lady who helped us was very nice & attentive. The atmosphere was perfect. The only thing that would had made this place better was if they had some more fixins food wise to go with the wines. We got the cheese plate with all four cheeses and two were really good. The bread was filling, but not great and the olives had pits and didn't have a good flavor that went with the cheese. Because this is such an inviting atmosphere it makes people want to linger and to me having some good lite fair to snack on is essential. Shaves parmigiana, some herb crackers, thicker bread, maybe dark chocolate shavings, berries, a few olive selections, and some other spread beyond the chutney because it was good, but took over the entire flavors of everything else because it's so strong.

When we got there, there was one guy inside at the far table working on a laptop.  So we could have had our choice of seating, we chose to sit at the bar because we are social people so why not.  Sara the bartender and master sommelier was so awesome!!!  We tasted some amazing wine and learned so much about what we like and why we like it.  We had so much fun just hanging out and talking.  A few other small groups of people came in and we all started talking, which is cool.... it felt like we were at someone's house.  It did get busier around 9 or so, but it was never packed.

Enter in a small alley off of Post, called Cosmos, descend  the steps and you'll find yourself in a cozy underground gem of a plush lounge filled with comfy sofas, chairs, and even foot rests! Antique lamps add a dim glow to the chill scene. On a Tuesday night around 10, this place was relatively empty. Perhaps people don't know about it, but that's fine by me. The bar tender is extremely nice and helpful. The wine selection is extensive, carrying wines from all over the world, even Israel. Unfortunately my good taste was a hindrance, as I initially ordered a sparkling Moscato from Israel. Apparently this was also the most popular wine available, as well as the one wine in the entire bar that was out of stock. So I ended up with a different sweet wine, from Sonoma or somewhere in the Napa Valley. Not overly sweet, not my favorite but definitely pleasant. Therefore, the high reviews are based therefore on the ambiance, and potential wine selection. I'll be back to the Hidden Vine, and am very much looking forward to trying the Moscato!", "author": "Kate A."}

That said, there's something infinitely appealing about this overtly cozy and charming basement bar, that seems just the sort of place you might take refuge in to escape from the chill embrace of oncoming fog.  Yes, the decor is a touch 'ye olde english' bronte-esque, and yes, it's in a hotel, and yes, it's accessed from an alleyway across from le colonial--ignore these features and focus on the positives, which are many and wonderful indeed.  The proprietors have assembled a focused and wonderful list that includes some familiar themes for you mundane folk shamefully addicted to the obviousness of napa merlot, but includes a number of cool and interesting items for those with a bit more adventurous a soul: flights are imagineative and education (and generously poured) and change frequently.  And speaking of the proprietors, they are incredibly friendly and gracious and deal with the occasional riff-raff that wander in (ah yes, \"Sideways\" has emboldened even the most feeble-minded of the cocktail crowd to order pinots that they couldn't possibly enjoy) with civility and aplomb.  The husband/wife duo that man the bar are always quick with a helpful suggestion and generous with their samples.  Given the jazz-infuzed, english-country womb-like feel to the place, I'd recommend this as more of a spot to wind-down the evening (i.e. it's probably not a place to hit to get ready for some raving).

It feels like a neighborhood treat, with perhaps a touch more class.  This is what I'd expect the Pub to be if it amped up the wine, cut down on the beer, and moved to San Francisco.  I'm lucky never to have been on too busy a night--the place is tiny and feels lively--I can't imagine what it's like on a non-week night.

It took a little while for us to get some chairs, but when we did, we were perfectly comfy.  The other thing that made this place solid was the fact that they had a meat and cheese plate in there and weren't jerks about the fact that we were all starving and gorging ourselves on their free food.  We ended up ordering a bottle of riesling, and when the server came back he asked us if the temperature of the wine was okay. We all thought it was fine, but he insisted that it was not correct temperature. We kept the bottle anyway, and when we got the bill, he still took off 10 percent and wrote a little note saying \"discount for putting up with crappy wine temperature\"  We thought it was super cool of him to do that and left him with a nice fat tip.", "author": "Jade L."}

It's a cool place to have a glass and relax and by no means would I not recommend it to people, especially if they don't drink lots of wine. Because, though service and ambiance receive five stars, the wine list was provincial by San Francisco standards, and was really pouring nothing out of this world amazing or anything really remotely unfamiliar, (though it was odd to see a Navarro wine by the glass, which was a first in the city,) Winery's like Laurel Glen and Serenity are really common, boring wines, so though I sucked down two glasses of wine, the Pinotage was simply OK and the Handley was great, but I knew that going in, and see Handley wines around quite frequently.

I followed him and explained that I meant no harm, and then volunteered to leave, with the request that my friends be allowed to stay.  Rather fiercely, he responded that that all of us had to leave to pay for my trangression.  I am not kidding.  It struck me that I was dealing with the most omnipotent order taker in the Tenderloin, and I decided to make haste before things got out of hand.   One of our group remained behind to discuss the matter further, at which point he declared that we were on private property; then he began dialing the police.
