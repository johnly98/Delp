But I peered in that one and saw no Japanese people in there. I have a rule of thumb that if you look into a restaurant there is not their own people in there, you have a problem. That's just feom experience.. if their own people won't eat there food, it must not be all that good. There happen to be a Japanese couple who went through the trouble of taking out their toddler from her stroller and folding up to walk down the stairs to go to this place. This place is not handicap friendly. The stairs was a bit steep to me. Be careful with your elders, you don't want them breaking a hip going down these steps. \n\nWhen you get to the bottom, your see the room is small. But bigger than the one next door. They do have a bar. I had the Katana ramen with tonkatsu broth and medium spicy flavoring. The tonkatsu broth was an additional $1. To add spicy flavoring was another $0.75. The chili oil gave the broth an extra depth to it. Just the right amount of spicy that didn't set your mouth on fire and be suffering through your meal. The ramen was perfectly done. If I could have a do over I would have requested to have my gyoza outside of the bowl. It made it soggy. I like my gyoza to be crispy, soggy gyoza isn't the greatest texture when you're wanting crunch. All in all. I would give their food a solid 4 stars. With so many places to eat at here in SF. IDK if it w as s so good I would forego exploring other eateries to come here again.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

My friend and I decided to try this place since our original choice was super busy on both nights we walked by there. This place was near our hotel so we walked there for a late dinner. So they are actually located at a basement level, so we had to walk downstairs to the restaurant. There was a line of people waiting along the stairs, but it moved along quickly. The interior was dark but spacious. \n\nI was all set to order a ramen, but then I saw that they had an Uni Don on the menu. My eyes lit up because I love uni, so I decided to try that. However, to my disappointment, our waitress indicated that they were all out of the uni. My excitement turned to being bummed out. So I ordered their signature Katanaya ramen, which was basically ramen with a combination of everything. It was average, nothing about this ramen really stood out for me.

The pork was too meaty and chewy. I would've preferred more fatty pieces for that tender texture. \n\nPORK BELLY\nWe got an order of pork belly and this dish was heavy with flavor.

Let me tell you, towards the end when we were about to finish our meal, couple tables across from us, we saw a family with a cup of steaming hot water. Either the waiter lied to us or she does not want to put the effort into giving us hot water. I was unpleasant about the service I received and I know when someone suggests eating, here again, I would definitely decline and try somewhere else that serves better ramen.  \n\nFood was mediocre also, I got the spicy tofu ramen. Not really good because the noodle they use taste like egg noodles they used in wonton noodle soup. I was really disappointed that the noodles did not match the soup base. My spicy tofu ramen contains so many cabbages and some tofu. I was really stuff with eating so many cabbages and I never see any ramen with that many cabbages.

(Plus an additional fifty cents to add spicy) I always crave pork belly though so I just had to splurge. Once we got our ramen I couldn't finish my pork belly as the quality of it was rather poor... the color looked off and the texture was too hard to chew. My friends didn't get the same ramen but they also noted how salty their respective dishes were. \n\nThey weren't happy with their meal and to be honest I'm a little disappointed at how the quality has declined since the year before. Perhaps it was just an isolated incident? Anyways, as a group we definitely weren't blown away by this experience.", "author": "Christine W."}

You'd be better served boiling some water and making a cup noodle; it'd taste better and you'd be saving money. \n\nThe Review: \nSan Francisco, I love you but... what is this place and why are they calling this ramen? \n\nI came to Katana-ya because I happened to be staying at a nearby hotel and as always, am looking for good Japanese restaurants. As always, I just do a quick google search and was thrilled to see that this place had pretty solid ratings on both Google and Yelp. To boot, I saw they were on lists that included, \"The 7 Best Ramen Restaurants in San Francisco\". \n\n\"Great! With ratings and articles like this, what could go wrong?\" Short answer: EVERYTHING. \n\nThe Ramen:\nOh, jesus... the ramen at Katana-ya is a hot mess. Trust me, it's just plain bad. \n \nI ordered the shio ramen and the menu said it comes with kara-age and gyoza. Makes sense as both are common sides with ramen in Japan. When it arrived, both items were inside my ramen. WTF? It made both items just soggy and gross. Mind you, they probably both wouldn't taste good even if they were served on the side but putting them inside just exacerbated everything. \n\nI wish I could tell you that the gyoza and kara-age in my ramen were the least of my concerns, but sadly, they weren't...\n\nSo how was the ramen? Simply put, the ramen at Katana-ya just didn't taste good; almost as if nothing was actually made at the restaurant. The gyoza actually tasted like it was purchased at the frozen aisle of a grocery store. \n\nMore over, the presentation of the ramen was awful. If you ever have ramen from a halfway decent ramen restaurant, the ingredients are each thoughtfully placed and in the end, you have something that looks pleasant to eat. What I got at Katana-ya was ramen that was disastrous to look at. Half of me thinks that the cook in the back was drunk and blind folded when he put this creation together. Absolutely no thought or care when into the presentation of the ramen. \n\nAs for the ramen broth, it just tasted off to me; I've had shio-ramen before but this was unlike any I've ever tried. It was... strange. \n\nOf course, with all of this said, it is absolutely possible that Katana-ya has some good items on their menu, but ramen just doesn't seem to be one of them. \n\nOther Things About Katana-ya: \n- The staff is very hands-off; not the type to check back on you and see if you need anything.\n- It's very dark and dingy inside; Kinda gross. I hated the atmosphere. \n\nThe Bottom Line:\nI still can't figure Katana-ya out. It's a place known for ramen but from what I could tell, they do ramen very poorly. Like I said earlier, there's a chance they have something good on the menu but it's honestly one I wouldn't be willing to bet on. \n\nDo yourself a favor; Skip Katana-ya. There are too many good restaurants in SF for you to spend your time and money here.", "author": "Kenji O."}

We stumbled upon this restaurant while we were actually looking for another sushi place (which we realized had closed). \n\nThis restaurant has super fun ambiance! You walk downstairs into the restaurant. It makes you feel like you're in another city, like NYC! Super cozy and intimate! Not many tables and a really cool wooden bar area!\n \nWe were seated immediately on this Sunday. Service is a bit spotty. Took off a star for service. They were short staffed and rarely came by our table unless we flagged them down. \n\nWe both got the ramen. Bowl was huge! Ramen was pretty good! It's a basic ramen with meat and chives. Anything like egg, seaweed, etc is an additional fee. Something like $1 I think?\n\nWe also ordered an appetizer of the fried chicken, which came out after our ramen..little odd. Chicken was fantastic! \nHad to flag the waitress down for water and the bill. Waiting for the bill took a good 10/15min. Or at least it felt like we were sitting there that long.

We saw so many good reviews for this place and wanted to check it out. We waited almost an hour for food...ended up being very disappointed.\n\n1. Everyone in my table got the same thing - miso Katana-ya ramen. (the special). As a table consensus, the broth just tasted weird. Usually, ramen broth is creamy and fatty but this broth it didn't only lack in this, it also just tasted bad. I've literally had boba shop ramen taste better than this. We did go around closing so maybe the chef just got tired or ran out of broth and quickly put something together, but that's not an excuse; especially for the price tag of 16 dollars/a bowl.\n\n2. The Karaage was seasoned pretty well, but why are the gyoza and karaage put inside the ramen broth? Who eats wet fried chicken? That just made me really confused.\n\n3. The service reminded me of fast food service. I saw the waitresses when they got the orders, the food, and the bill. That's it. I understand that it's customary to pre-charge tip (18%) for larger tables but at least show so type of effort even when you know you'll get the tip regardless.\n\nTL;DR:\nBroth was bad. Service was really lackluster. Fried chicken was seasoned pretty well, but soggy. Expensive. I don't recommend.", "author": "Jason L."}

This restaurant was suggested to me by the concierge at the hotel where I stayed while I was in San Francisco for a few days. He told me that this was a place where I can get authentic Ramen. And I don't mean the ramen that most folks from the states think about.  Plus,  I don't mean the ramen that college kids buy for $0.10 a bag. This stuff is delicious! The soup is especially for this time of year because it is served hot. Although, it is a Japanese dish, it contains Chinese-style noodles made of wheat.  I couldn't get enough of the big, tasty noodles.  These noodles are served in a meat or fish broth that is flavored with either soy sauce or miso. This restaurant offered three different options (miso, soy or salt) for a basic Raman. Then the noodles are topped with such options as sliced pork, seaweed or scallions.   In my case I chose slices of BBQ pork in my Ramen, plus wonderful seaweed.  I ordered the Miso because it is the most popular and this would be my first experience with having authentic Ramen.\n\n The first entryway into this restaurant was a was a little off-putting. However,  because it is a wonderful Hole-in-the -Wall Restaurant, you have to go downstairs before you can actually enter the establishment.  Once you come downstairs, you enter a very cozy atmosphere (the restaurant is small and only seats about 40 people comfortably). I was greeted immediately and seated at the bar, since I was alone. The server was very patient with my \"Ramen ignorance\" and I really appreciated that.   Once I ordered, per his gentle suggestion, the food came quickly (it was lunchtime) and I had to wait for the Ramen to cool a little.  Though it was served piping hot, I couldn't eat it in that condition.  \n\nEverything about this quaint place appealed to me.

My dish was around $12 and it came with noodles, seaweed, and some pork. Any other add ones would be through ordering the specialty ramens, or paying for the extras like egg or kimchi. Overall, I thought the ramen was just mediocre. I didn't have very strong feelings towards or against it since I was just stopping in for a quick dinner.

Located below the sidewalk with stairs towards the opening, it's a little inconvenient for people that have trouble walking, including disabled people. It's really dark in there which also is inconvenient. It was quiet at the time me and my friend arrived, but the service seemed ehh. The menu didn't have that many options just like any other ramen places, short and simple. I opted for the Katana-ya ramen also the most expensive one out of the options at $16.99 I believe which had many toppings like fried gyoza, corn, seaweed, chashu, and pork belly. When the ramen arrived, the ramen was rather hot warm than piping hot which threw me off. Right away, I tried their broth which wasn't so bad, just wished it was hotter. I also took a bite of their ramen and I liked the texture, but it left this stench taste in my mouth, almost like plastic hence I just drank most of the broth and ate the toppings. I don't know what the ramen had, but it just left a plastic taste I couldn't stand. Besides that, this is ehhh. There are definitely better ramen somewhere else.

Pretty sad that my favorite part was the corn in the bowl. \n\nService was also terrible. We were done with our meals and had to ask for a check and then our check was brought to us 15min later by someone else - it also wasn't crazy crowded so can't blame business on the poor service. Waitress seemed to have an attitude with us when we sat down. Fake tight smiles, no personality. Even asked if we were done while ordering. I'm sorry I'm ordering a lot - usually that means you'll get a bigger tip!! We got 2 ramen bowls, sake and sushi. Not like we were asking for anything special or modifications. It was just me and my boyfriend and we aren't high maintenance but we do enjoy some personality, waters filled and a timely check drop. \n\nBest part of the experience was the spicy salmon roll.

My favorite is the Katanaya Ramen Spicy Miso flavor. It has plenty of goodies in it - karaage, gyoza, BBQ poke slices, egg, and corn. The portion is great and their ramen noodles is pretty decent. I love their broth the most. It's usually all gone by the end of the meal :P\n\nI tried out their Special Pork Belly Ramen in my most recent visit. I have to say I was disappointed. Instead of being \"slow cooked to perfection\" as the menu claimed, the pork belly was sadly overcooked. My friend ordered the same thing and hers was dry and hard as well, so it was probably not bad luck. Maybe it was due to how late we came in (around 11pm), but it was sub par from their usual food quality for sure.\n\nThe upstair part of the restaurant is currently under some remodeling as far as I can tell, which means only downstair seatings are available.

Simple enough, but I just can't help myself and need to complicate things & say why I've always liked Katana-Ya. I've been coming here for years and like thrilllist.com says... \n\n\"The only ramen address where Lonely Planet-toting tourists and savvy locals line up with each other, Katana-Ya served the masses long before ramen was cool. Really -- it was even a destination before Asian fusion cuisine ripped apart the '90s. It's old school, it's crowded, it's an essential enough San Francisco institution that it's worth the line\". - thrilllist.com food critic\n\nYup. That pretty much summarizes why I've been coming here for years. Well before hipsters knew the difference between Nissin Instant Ramen vs. Authentic Japanese Ramen. I mean even Michelin recommends this somewhat cramped \"tokyo-like\" eatery. For me, it's all about the noodle & Katana-Ya never disappoints. I usually go with the Shoyu base regular Ramen w/ Karaage (on the side) + added Gyoza. It's simple, hardy, and satisfies my cravings. If I'm famished I'll go with the combination with a choice of Ramen, Soba, or Udon (I choose Ramen) & includes a mini Donburi (I usually go with the Tonkatsu or Tempura over hot Japanese Rice). I always go with the house hot tea & glass of Tenderloin water. \n\nNote: Mild-Extra Spicy options.

Hot garbage. We walked out.\n\nThe owners have shown they're either confused about what they have to offer, or they just stopped caring.

If you want a real bowl of authentic ramen try Menya Ramen (San Diego) even food star Andrew Zimmern made a stop there. As for Katana is easy to find it's right in the heart of Union Square. However, I must warn anyone with a walking disability or who uses a wheelchair should skip this place. At the very tip of the entrance there is a very steep flight of stairs. Even an athletic person like myself found it quite difficult making my way down the stairs but I was wearing high heel boots! Once you make it down the steps (hopefully with no broken bones) the restaurant itself is quite small. The ramen however is served in HUGE bowls and for the price the serving size is quite generous. You can easily share one bowl with another adult or two small children. They will give you extra bowls if you ask. I ordered the ramen and sushi combo. I got tuna and it was served over a bowl of rice. The sushi was fresh tasting and the serving was decent there was about 4-5 pieces of fish. Out of all my foodie adventures on my recent trip to San Fran this was my least favorite meal. Then again it's impossible for any place to beat Gary Danko where I dined at the night before.

Now, the ramen is just okay, but twice as expensive as it used to be.\n\nFriends from down south found Katana-Ya online and wanted to try it. When they mentioned it I was excited because I used to love the spicy kimchi ramen (which they don't even have anymore). It had been a few years since I'd been to Katana-Ya, so I was hoping the ramen was as good as I remembered. Unfortunately it wasn't.\n\n- Katanaya ramen $12.95\n\nThe spicy kimchi ramen they once had and was my favorite is no longer on the menu. Instead, I went with the Katanaya ramen because the server said it was the most popular and it has their name in it. There's a lot of sh*t in this ramen: BBQ pork slices, gyoza, karage, etc. I felt like the broth was too thin and salty. Ramen broth should be rich with flavor (not just salt), and this wasn't. The noodles were a decent al dente, which was good, but overall, the ramen, for the price, was just unimpressive. \n\nService wasn't very good. Our server was regularly missing. We had to keep trying to flag people down for water and the bill. When we finally flagged people down, they didn't seem to care much about the fact that we'd been trying to get anyones attention for a while. \n\nOverall, I'm super sad that this place has gone downhill.

I've always gotten their katanaya ramen (12.95) that comes with pork, an egg, bamboo shoots, seaweed, and chicken. It's a little too salty for my liking, but add some spice and cold weather, I wouldn't mind it. It's great they also open super late!\n\nThe restaurant itself is VERY small and squished. I've usually came here when the wait was about 10-20 minutes. My first time here I sat by the door and it got a little uncomfortable, so the times after I always preferred sitting towards the sushi bar and by the bathrooms. \n\nThey offer other Japanese food such as sushi, nigiri, and donburi. Good to know they have other options for those who aren't craving ramen.", "author": "Kathleen S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-04", "description": "Last night on 2/3/2016, I decided to have a Luncher here at this place called, \"Katana-Ya.\" With over 3500 Yelp reviews and counting, this local Japanese restaurant has it all delivering the guests with the finest Ramen noodles, sushis, BBQ, and more! As I entered their doors, the atmosphere is quite laid back inside. The concept is much wooden Japanese made inside this small rectangular room.\n\nThe employees here are doing a fine job here for making the customers like me an enjoyable service. One of the issues here is this place needs more improvement for more customer service to make it more appealing without letting it over and let it go. I'm sure it needs it in the near future. So far, no cons at all.\n\nNow onto the food! I ordered the Ramen noodle with a choice of soup base: miso, soy, or spicy which I chose the miso, plus two strips of BBQ pork, and an optional choice of add ons which I added a hard-boiled egg for an extra protein punch. As I ate it, it tasted very good! The broth of that miso is on point, and delicious which I can feel the flavors of added sesame oil. The BBQ pork strips and a hard-boiled egg also tasted fantastic too especially the boiled/cooked Ramen. Simply an irresistible meal!\n\nParking at Katana-Ya can be difficult to park. You can park it at the nearest surface metered street parking nor the parking garage. Otherwise, you can ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation easier without the hassles.\n\nAfter all, Katana-Ya is a fine, yet remarkable Japanese restaurant that I've ever tasted right at the Union Square neighborhood in San Francisco. Perfect for friends/family gatherings. A well, worthy visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

This restaurant is definitely one of the better ramen places I have gone to. The venue here is pretty small but it's quite cozy and clean. The service here was pretty fast and they fill up your water, which I find most ramen places rarely do unless you ask.\n\nI ordered the Soy Ramen with extra corn and my friend ordered the Miso Katana-Ya ramen. I like how the menu allows you to have 3 broth options for every type of ramen. I do wish they included an egg in every ramen dish like others do. I liked the Soy broth better than the Miso since the Miso seemed a bit too salty. The broth here is definitely more oily than some ramen places. I also really liked the noodles here and they were the perfect amount of chewy. If I'm ever in the area and am craving ramen, I would definitely come back!", "author": "Catherine S."}

It's a lot bigger than it first appears (it's pretty hard to find, very small sign and it's underground), and can get pretty loud at night. If you're looking for an intimate dinner, this might not be the right place to go. Great for happy hour or a group dinner though!\n\nI tried multiple sushi rolls and got their Japanese curry, which was pretty good! I don't think it was anything SUPER special, but I really enjoyed my sushi - I forgot the exact roll, but it was some sort of salmon/lemon one! It was FANTASTIC. My friend and I shared the karaage appetizer, which was a surprisingly large amount of chicken and also pretty delicious. I would say that their expansive menu was really impressive, too - it seemed like they had almost every Japanese dish I'd ever seen before!\n\nI would give this place a shot despite its low reviews - it's a tad bit pricey but what Japanese restaurant in heart of SF is not...?

It's not that I expected the best thing evar, but, by definition, this is completely wrong. I also ordered the small which cost $10.95. The gyoza is made with thick, gummy, chinese dumpling skins and barely qualifies as gyoza. You also get four of them, no Japanese person serves a bad-luck four pieces of anything. \n\n*sigh.

I saw the Yelp food safety score and although I almost hesitated to go in, I really wanted ramen wasn't willing to walk an further so why not give this place a try.  Service was prompt and we were immediately seated.  All I wanted was a nice bowl of ramen so after quickly glancing at their menu, we decided to order their big bowl of Katana-Ya Ramen as it was a popular choice.  After waiting a bit, the server brought out two large bowls of ramen and we immediately dug in.\n\nThe ramen for the most part was decent, it didn't taste like authentic to me, and I could taste the difference in quality compared to the other ramen I've had before.  Although it was a big bowl and definitely did the job of satisfying my ramen craving, something was missing.  Maybe it was broth, or the toppings in the bowl, which included fried dumplings for some reason; but it just didn't feel like real ramen to me.  The dumplings tasted like they were thawed from a freezer and the broth just didn't taste right to me.  Not only that but for the price I paid for the Katana-Ya Ramen ($13-14), I was expecting a lot more, but I was ultimately disapointed in this big bowl of ramen.\n\nWould I come back here again? Probably not, but for anyone that is desperate for ramen and unwilling to wait the long lines, then this place is okay; don't get the Katana-Ya Ramen and maybe try something else on the menu.", "author": "David L."}

Since it wasn't exactly safe to stop and find somewhere to eat,  we ended up at Katana-Ya ramen because it popped up in my search results. \n\nThankfully I had a seemingly more pleasant experience than fellow yelpers...  I don't hesitate to bump up a 3.5 rating to a 4 due to the short wait time and flavorful broth. \n\nPerhaps my lowered standards are due to the fact that there aren't that many great ramen places in the east bay area for me to indulge in.. I found the broth to be really flavorful with lots of flavor without being too salty. With the Katana-Ya ramen I ordered, it came with a couple of gyoza, karaage, and half of a perfectly soft boiled egg included in the ramen. For added spiciness,  you have to pay an additional charge though.\n\nArriving around 3pm on Saturday, there was no wait and we were seated immediately at a cramp table by the door, but we were able to put in our orders quickly and the ramen came out in a timely manner as well. The only thing that was negative was the fact that their chashu was EXTREMELY dry... So dry that I didn't even want to bother trying to chew on them. Luckily, the chicken karaage soaking in broth was enough to satisfy my meaty cravings. \n\nAlthough Katana-Ya ramen was on the pricier side,  the portion was fair for the price and the location of the restaurant makes it easy to walk over to a bar nearby with no hassle for after dinner drinks!", "author": "Evelynn C."}

For me, I was caught off guard what the crispy spicy tuna actually was.  I was expecting something like the crispy rice with spicy tuna on top, but what actually arrived was salad with a fried spicy tuna roll on top.  It was pretty good, but it wasn't what I had imagined.  They need some descriptions on their menu.\n\nI'm not sure if it was because I was one of the earlier tables there, they open at 1130 they did let me go in a little earlier to sit down but they did warn me about their start time.  That was appreciated.  I did order around 1130 as promised but then it took a while for me to get my ramen.

HA HA I'm going to serve those two things at my wedding!). I met up with my best friend for dinner and I was such a cheerleader for this place saying that it had so many reviews on yelp blah blah blah...\n\nWe came last night for dinner around 5:45ish there was no wait at all, several empty tables and we were seated right away(Awesome!). By the time we left there was a line going up the stairs! I ordered the takoyaki $8.95 of course and the pork belly appetizer $9.95... first of all, that's the most expensive takoyaki I've ever paid for.... Y'all who follow me know that I'm obsessed with takoyaki. Most places that I go to from San Diego all the way up to North Bay are priced around $4.50-$6ish. Damn Katana-Ya! Way to over-price! It comes out to over $1 per tiny ball! The takoyaki tasted just okay though, not the best I've had. The pork belly was served in a bowl and I was surprised that they give you so many pieces! I thought it would just be one big slab but it actually reminds me of Filipino Chicharon (pork rinds) except this isn't cripsy or fried.. I think it's braised actually... The pork belly was not good, damn did it lack flavor or what? It could use a sweet and sour glaze (similar to that of Carnitas Snack Shack in San Diego). I'm not sure what I was tasting but I think it tasted somewhat fruity? TF? Kinda tasted like eating person. Service was okay.

We had somewhat a high expectation...\n\nThe exterior didn't look like much. The inside was not too big, it felt very cramped. It had lots of interesting huge light fixtures of many colors hanging, creating this strange, purple - red hue inside the restaurant. Looked a bit old, not super clean, but then again, it was rather dark with weird colored lights.\n\nWe got seated quickly, and we decided on what we wanted. Easy enough. However, getting a server's attention was not easy. After a little while, we finally caught a server and made our orders. When the food arrived, the strange purple lighting made the food look weird... The food was all ok, nothing special. \n\nThe worst thing about this restaurant was the service. I am not sure if they care about their customer, they really are not attentive, helpful, or polite. We couldn't get anyone to refill our water. We had to wait forever for someone to take our order and to bring us our check. The way they treated us was almost rude.

Of course, it likely was a tourist trap, though I thought I would give it a try. I entered the restaurant at street level and walked down a set of stairs. The restaurant was dark, though spacious and decorated. There was no wait at 4 PM on a Saturday, though when we were leaving, there was definitely a small crowd waiting.\n\nI got the Miso Ramen, which came hot and quickly. Though that was probably the only plus and the ramen was disappointing from then on. The first thing I noticed was how the bowl was drowned in soup and had almost no visual aesthetic. The soup was simply not memorable. If anything it reminded me of a slightly better instant noodle soup. The noodles themselves were a little bit too chewy and tasteless. The worse part was the meat--extremely salty and sort of just fell apart in my mouth. Finally, the portion size was small and I was barely satisfied.\n\nOverall: This place is definitely a tourist trap, located about 1 block from union square.

I loved the fried chicken and the gyoza that was included, both were flavorful but not soggy at all. Even though, they were sitting in the soup. The outer layer of the gyoza was super unique and different from other ramen places. I would recommend adding a side of gyozas(2pc) for $3 (:   The ramen also includes half egg, 2 pork slice, corn seaweed and g onions. Corn was sweet, seaweed was tasty. Ahh, everything was good about this ramen, it's also the restaurant name haha\n\nThe scallop nigiri was super fresh, the sashimi pieces were big , the scallop melts in your mouth. I usually don't like wasabi , but the perfect amount of wasabi was put on the rice . Loved it.\n\nThe spider roll had 4 large pieces, there was tobiko on the rice . The deep fried soft shell crab was super crispy with a little bit of unagi sauce on it. A decent roll ! \n\nMy cousin thinks the rice is #1 important in sushi , the rice here is approved by my picky cousin :) \n\nOverall , our check was about $70 , a little pricey but considering location and taste , it was well worth it.", "author": "Tiffany F."}

I must say that my first impression of the restaurant as a whole is dingy. This should have been the absolute first indication that Katana-Ya does not serve authentic ramen, because every single Japanese establishment I have been to (no matter how small or cramped) has been absolutely meticulous. The counters, floors, and sauce containers were clean and unsticky. However, the bathroom was atrocious and smelled like my grandma (and not in a good way). With that being said, I still decided to give the ramen a chance.\n\nI ordered the flagship Katana-Ya Ramen, which came with karaage and fried gyoza inside the broth. I had several issues with the ramen. Firstly - I'm not even sure how I feel about this concept as a whole. Why fry something only to let it soak in broth and become soggy? Secondly - the fry batter on the karaage did not seem to be close to authentic and I have never seen fried gyoza with such thick skin. Thirdly - I chose the Miso broth and while it wasn't too salty, I have definitely had better. Perhaps I've been spoiled with Misoya in Chicago. Lastly - The egg provided is not a traditional ramen egg. Great ramen eggs are marinated with a creamy (almost gelatinous orangey yolk). The ones here are just plain  boiled eggs... not even soft boiled. \n\nAt the end of the day, the service I received was mediocre and the ramen is a far cry from the best that I've ever had.  The ambience also left more to be desired... really.. what kind of shop gives you bamboo chopsticks? I thought Cali was supposed to be green. I definitely won't be back here.

A cavernous bowl big enough to feed two was placed in front of me. Impressive. However, the noodle accoutrements were a bit lacking (did I use that correctly? *shoulder shrugs*). I got two pieces of charsui and a whole gang of green onions and seaweed in place of the usual corn-bamboo-shoot-cabbage-etc. variety. What's more, ramen, when ordered as a combo, doesn't come with an egg. Uhm, come again??? I had to waive the waitress down to add one to my order -- not to mention it was just a plain ol' boiled egg, not one of them fancy marinated eggs most places give you. In anycase, the broth was decent, the few pieces of charsui I did get were tender, and the noodles had a good bite, just how I prefer them. \n\nThe verdict? All in all, once you get over the part where you feel a little gypped about the fewer ramen toppings, you realize that the flavor is good enough to not leave you too miffed about your overall meal. Plus, that rice was on point. Though I would chose other ramen joints over this one, I can see why people who live or work in the area might frequent it out of convenience, value, and the promise of a decent meal.\n\nSo handle that, Geary St. dwellers. Come to Katana-Ya for a some ramen if you're craving it. Just please don't go in expecting the cream of the noodle-y crop.", "author": "Vi T."}

The pork could have been cooked more, wasn't tender at all. The noodles also seemed like they could have been cooked more. The miso broth was good and the portion was hefty but the overall taste wasn't anything to write home about.

I ordered the medium density so it wasn't too salty but came with a lot of flavor. The fried chicken was awesome as well. crispy and nicely soaked up the broth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-13", "description": "This tiny restaurant with a red brick facade is located a couple of blocks away from Union Square, just far enough from all the tourists and their selfie sticks. The ambience is intimate, with dim lighting and small capacity, ideal for groups of 2 or 3, but they can also accommodate larger parties--I went with 8 people, and that was no problem. I went to spend some time with good friends, and try Katana-ya's (supposedly) famous ramen. Or so I thought. More on that later.\n\nPork Belly Donburi (4/5)-$11.95 The rice bowl was served soft and warm; went well with the pork belly, which in turn was soft, tender and flavorful. This meal was served with miso soup. \n\nHawaiian Sushi Roll (3/5)-$13.95. Not too bad of a roll, I've had way worse compared to this one. Presentation needs work--the roll was served on a small plate, and it just didn't look appealing to me. The sushi rice was soft and fluffy, no complaints there. The fish--salmon, tuna, butter fish--were alright. Nothing too special about this roll, didn't feel like it worth the money. I don't recommend it. \n\nHamachi Sashimi (4/5)-$19 & Salmon Sashimi (3/5)-$13. They have 3, 6, and 9 piece options for the sashimi plate. I'd say the cut is worth the price. Salmon wasn't that fresh, it didn't have that bright orange color and had obviously been frozen for a while. Hamachi on the other hand, was pretty good.\n\nPork Belly Ramen (1/5)-$13.95. Are you sure this place is known for their Ramen? Look at my picture; sloppy presentation to the max. It's the opposite of scrumptious. The broth tasted nothing like rich pork bone broth but rather just watery MSG. It was very oily, but it was not from its gelatin. This is thus far the worst ramen I've experienced in town. Ramen was so-so. Overall, I'd rather have Japanese instant ramen, it might've been better. \n\nThis place charges 18% fee for party of 6 and more and takes maximum two cards. Please be sure to double check your bill, as all the tax, tips and gratuity are included and you don't need to do anything after the pre-tip amount. \n\nBottom line, this place stays open till late, unless there's absolutely nothing to eat around, I probably wouldn't come back.", "author": "Tammy C."}

The place was small and a bit tight, but yet totally reminded me of some of the old school restaurants in Dublin IR. Not a big issue, it's the city; so it is what it is. Although, I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group here. Our table seemed clean, and I was ready to order!\n\nStarted with the Cheese-Age appetizer; basically white fish with cream cheese in it. For those that know me, I hate cream cheese in my sushi. It was like a Philly roll, only dipped in batter and fried.  I didn't care for it, sorry!  But thank God for the Toro sashimi ($6.50), it melted in my mouth and saved the appetite.\n\nNow, how to order ramen?  The menu may look confusing, but all you have to do is select the soup type, spicy level, and if you want it rich or light.  I chose the miso, and had an excellent bowl of hot ramen noodles with chicken karage, not spicy.  My Chicken Karage bowl was nice'n'hot, and just delish!  If you can't decide on what to order, I would recommend the original Katanaya bowl.  It had beef slices, some chicken karage, and goyza.  Sooo good!  Super filling, and I really enjoyed it too!\n\nOverall, it was pretty average.  $43 for two bowls off noodle soup, one appetizer, and six pieces of sashimi.  \n~ No issues with service either, as it was quick. \n~ Definitely a great place to grab some ramen, especially after a party!

My coworkers and I wanted to try Ramen, so I suggested this one after my first visit. Located about a block away from Union Square, you can find this restaurant, easily spotted by it's sign that faces both ways on the sidewalk. My first visit, we only had the upstairs option, but to my surprise, there was another room located downstairs. We were seated right away, and this was around 7pm.\n\nThe decor of both rooms is pretty nice. The lighting is lowkey, setting a very mellow vibe. The walls are filled with oriental decorations. During this visit, they had both floors open because it was still late afternoon time. They were playing edm music, a nice touch to keep the environment lively. We were sat right away and had our orders taken in no time. This time around, I decided to order the limited time Pork Belly Ramen that was being featured on the front of the menu. I also put in an order of Gyoza. My coworkers decided to try it too as we also ordered the ingredients for sake bombs. Our waiter even encouraged that we test the craftsmanship of the table with our sake bomb procedure.\n\nWe received our pitcher of imported beer and a bottle of sweet tasting sake pretty fast. Between 3 people, we were able to do like 2.5 sake bombs worth. As soon as we finished our last drink, our food came out.\n\nThe Gyoza was pretty good. Cooked perfectly with some good Gyoza sauce. It was pan fried, and not deep fried. I like both styles so I'm not complaining. Our huge bowls of ramen came out and it was a site to be seen. A lot of noodles, a lot of soup, and a lot of pork belly. The soup was really hearty, the noodles really firm, and the pork belly was simply delicious. Definitely a contender for one of my favorite braised pork belly bowls.\n\nIf you're in the area, this is a good ramen place to check out.", "author": "Robert O."}

The California roll (not fancy, just average what you would expect) was way better than the ramen! \n\nI chose shoyu (soy sauce broth) over miso. Broth was okay, not as salty as I remembered which is a good thing. Noodles were a bit over cooked and just too much in the bowl. Maybe if it was good noodles, I wouldn't be complaining. Chicken karaage was oily and did not taste freshly fried, potstickers weren't that good either, best part of the bowl was the corn which wasn't even sweet but I'm biased because I love corn and it was white corn. I was a bit upset that it wasn't put into the bowl in one area so I couldn't spoon a spoonful of corn at once easily! \nI was able to eat half the ramen and couldn't eat anymore, even if you paid me or bribed me. During the meal, I told my husband at least three times that I wish we had I some freshly minced garlic to help. He felt the exact same way. $13.95 per Katanaya ramen and with the California roll, bill was $35 excluding tip. I would not want to come back again. \n\nNot to mention, this place is dimly lit.

Despite all of that, I can count on this place to quickly bring me a ridiculously large portion of deliciousness for a very decent price. My favorite item is the Katana-ya ramen, which comes with a ton of stuff in it (fried chicken, pork, boiled egg, corn, seaweed, etc) and is always far too much for me to eat - I usually save half for lunch the next day. \n\nIt's not the fanciest and the physical location is a bit grimy, but I just stay selective about who I take there or recommend it to. You should not go there if you prefer to get dressed up and demand perfect service and pristine conditions and zero wait time on every occasion. I've never eaten a disappointing meal there, and when I'm in the mood for consistently good, inexpensive large portions in a hole-in-the-wall environment, this is where I go.", "author": "Sarah G."}

Gotta be careful about that! I think this place has higher ratings more for their drinking an chilling atmosphere than for their ramen \n\nThey were known for their Extra Spicy Ramen so I ordered that. The boyfriend for the BBQ Pork Ramen. Both ramen a were extremely oily. Very oily. To the point where it literally was like drinking oil, butter, and bile all at once. No joke. And there's no flavor in the ramens!! I normally love drinking everything broth but this was too gross. Furthermore, both broths taste very diluted  \n\nDecoration is very weird, colorful, and abstract. NOt typical of an authentic Japanese restaurant that I'm used to! :( Bathroom was weird! Door doesn't really lock but it's kind of locked at the same time? It's weird...\n\nPros:\n-Opens late until 0130AM in case you night owls are desperate for some....bad ramen :D\n-I like their noodles though! Same type of noodles as you would get for peanut sauce noodles for all you Taiwanese people...you know what I'm talking about ;) \n-they don't just serve ramen here..also sushi and alcohol! The vibe is kind of like a bar restaurant. A lot of people come to drink and chill. So their specialty isn't in ramen :(\n-you can ask for either light or rich density for your broth\n\nCons: \n-oily broth \n-not flavorful\n-bad service (we had to keep reminding them to bring us our waters!)\n-a lot of their items are crossed off on their menu...hmm wonder why? I was disappointed cause I wanted to try mabo tofu ramen but it was crossed off :( \n-Extra Spicy Ramen? Was not spit AT ALL. Just really red lol\n\nConclusion: If you must, must eat ramen in norcal, I highly suggest Ramen Dojo :)", "author": "Cuc N."}

I finally got a chance to experience this tonight when I went to grab my usual late night ramen.\n\nWhen you walk downstairs, it was surprising to see how spacious the new dine-in area is and nice music bumping in the background as usual.  The owner from what I remember is also really friendly and has been accommodating on past occasions.  This time, I ordered the original ramen with soy and added corn.  After eating a few bites, my throat began to hurt from how salty the broth was.  I also was served with no napkins and had to hail my server again for some napkins.  Additionally, the soy and chili bottles were dirty and I got grease all over my fingers.  Gross! Next time, maybe someone should wipe them down especially since tonight was a slow night...\n\nI figured it was time to order something else, since my ramen was barely edible.  I called my server over and asked how much it would cost to add a Salmon Don (as part of the combo special).  He seemed confused and said he didn't know what that was.  I then asked for a menu that was sitting at a nearby table and when I pointed out what I was referring to, he looked offended.  Then, he said, \" I think it's 16 or 17\".  I said, \"Is it 16, 17..which one is it?  If you're not sure, maybe you can check with the manager\".  He snapped back at me and said, \"I'm the manager\". I explained to him that my soup was too salty and I couldn't eat it and needed to order something else and he completely ignored my concern.  Then he said, \"It's 16 and 17 cents\".  What the heck was his problem.   I was so appalled at his attitude!  Never seen him before so I think he must be new.  Regardless- Katanaya: a word of advice.  TRAIN YOUR STAFF BETTER, PLEASE.  Attitude and poor service not acceptable for a historic local establishment like yours.\n\nAlso, the portions are same price, but heavily reduced in portion.  Quality poor.  Too overrated for my tastebuds!", "author": "Phan .."}

The Ramen was fine, but again, I've had better. \n\nThe tonkatsu don, on the other hand, was terrible! The rice was undercooked and the fried katsu pieces were greasy and overly-fried. The tonkatsu don comes with a lettuce salad drenched in dressing. \n\nMy wife had the combination set with a regular miso-based Ramen and an unagi don. The unagi don was actually quite good and the rice was surprisingly moist. Not sure why there was a difference in the rice between the two dons, but it was night and day. \n\nOther notable point is that alcohol is extremely overpriced here.

It's a pretty expansive menu with items ranging from the apps to ramen to sushi to rice bowls. If torn between choices, they have half-and-half specials. I went for the namesake Katana-Ya ramen in miso broth and it was decent. I thought the broth was flavorful and the variety of ingredients (pork, fried chicken, fried potstickers, corn, scallion, and seaweed) was a nice touch. If I were to order it again though I would probably ask for the fried items on the side. Alas, I was a little disappointed with the consistency of the noodles compared to other ramen joints - I wished there was a little more spring to their noodles. \n\nAll things considered, I wouldn't mind coming back to Katana-Ya but not if the line is ridiculous.

My sister had the gyoza, and the dipping sauce wasn't vinegar based. When asked for vinegar, they said they didn't have any which is a lie because you need vinegar to make sushi. When we got the check I was surprised to see that the tip was already added with no option to alter it. Service was meh. Felt like we were asking too much when requesting things.

No music but great decoration! I'd go back if we're hunting for delicious ramen; otherwise, there are more interesting places to go!\n\nService: We must have gotten there as it had just opened, even though it was a little before 12:30am on a Sunday. Regardless, we walked in and the place was empty apart from a waitress putting down chairs and placing napkins/soy sauce/chopsticks on tables. We were helped quickly though. Our waters were also constantly filled throughout the course of the meal, which was nice. However, there wasn't too much interaction with our waitress. The only real times we talked were to order our food and to ask for a container for our leftovers. I'd say that the service was intended to be attentive while being a background to the actual meal, and it achieved its goal wonderfully. \n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant was very well decorated and despite being tiny, was still brightly lit and not too cramped. Tables were made of granite and had a heating element in the middle, which I assume is for cooking meat for certain dishes. Even with the 1ft hole in the middle of the table, there was adequate space for our dishes. Strangely, there was no music of any kind at any point during our meal. It might have been to complement the previously mentioned subdued, non-intrusive environment or it might have just been too early for music. \n\nFood: I ordered a combination meal, which was a bowl of ramen and a side plate with a 6 piece sushi roll of spicy tuna. We ate the sushi roll throughout the meal and thought it was defintiely a quality roll. Surprisingly the ginger that was served with the sushi was really notable too! However the ramen was definitely the centerpiece of the meal. While mine didn't have an egg on top, it came with the ramen noodles, green onions, seaweed, and 2 pieces of BBQ pork in a miso soup broth. It was really quite delicious! Served quite hot, it stayed warm for the entire meal while being cool enough to start eating right away. Proportionally, I wished I might have had a bit more pork in the meal and maybe an egg as well, but the base ramen was still quite good on its own. The broth was very rich and full of flavor, and the noodles were pefectly cooked. My dining partner's spicy tofu ramen was also awesome, but I think this restaurant is even better because each dish had such a distinct flavor. \n\nRecommendation: I really enjoyed the ramen here! It was simply made and very delicious, making it one of the best ramen I've tasted. However, the environment didn't leave too much of a lasting impression, so unless I wanted to show people the very best ramen I've found so far, I'd probably rather choose to continue exploring the city for other delicious ramen.", "author": "John B."}

Despite their warnings, I came here anyways on a Thursday during lunch time. The restaurant is pretty small, so there was a long wait.\n\nI ordered the Katana-ya ramen. They put a few pieces of karaage chicken and a couple of gyoza in the broth. I actually enjoyed the chicken but the gyoza weren't that tasty. The broth and the noodles was what I had issue with the most. The broth is watery and not flavorful. It was just salty and bland. The noodles tasted like the kind of noodle from instant noodle packages. It was overly tender. I enjoy chewing on the noodle but I was not able to get that satisfaction with my ramen here. They do have a lot of other flavors of ramen on the menu, so I may return back to try a different flavor.", "author": "Wayne C."}

I've heard they are under new management now and it seems to show, especially with its service. They are certainly really strict about their wait list policy. When the lady called my name, the rest of my party was walking here from the corner of the same block. I told her they'd be here in 30 secs and she kept asking me where they are. Instantly, they gave away our table. That's their policy though so I can't argue it.\n\nWhen we were seated, no server came for some time. We finally ordered...I ordered the combo ramen with curry don. When our bowls arrived, I asked about my side of curry don and the person told me they don't have it. I said the server took my order and never told me they were out and never even came back to tell me that they didn't have it! Someone that seems like the manager came to talk to me and he said the original server that took our order didn't know they were out of curry. The manager offered to get me another don so I got a tonkatsu done. When we were near done with our ramen, the tonkatsu don finally arrived. The manager said he brought me a large size order to make up for the mistake. Too bad the don was more rice than tonkatsu. He still charged me for it though... Would've been nice to at least have it comped.\n\nIn the end, even the ramen broth and  noodles itself tasted different from the past. It just wasn't as good...as flavorful as before. It's great that this place still opens late at night given the limited food options open after hours but it's unfortunate that I can't ever come back again.

I do not understand (and never will) why this small ramen shop, could pass being smaller than a matchbox, has over whooping 3,000+reviews! Does it mean it's that amazing or is it really all hype? Continue on and I'll tell you.. \n\nSolid 3.5 stars. 15 minutes wait time to get seated at the bar next to two Japanese guys who are huge like sumo wrestlers, being squished in between. This place is super small, no joke! The service was friendly and efficient. Cool Japanese contemporary decors, not very well-lit, with cool vintage Japanese lantern lamps accented with reds. It has a sushi bar that seats about 5 people, with 6 small tables. They have the usual broth flavorings: miso, soy, or salt, but also a spicy broth, which is a couple dollars more. I aimlessly had the signature Katana-Ya ramen, with a nice array of garnishes, including buttered corn, chopped green onions, half egg, seaweed, a couple gyozas, meat, and a few other ingredients. The broth is pretty darn good, which has a succulent taste! It will surely fill up your tummy with yummy!

I usually order their Katanaya ramen which pretty much has everything thrown into the bowl.\n\nThe place is pretty tiny and gets packed early during the usual lunch and dinner hours. They have a sign-in sheet next to the entrance. But if you're dining solo, you can almost always find a seat at the bar. The one thing that I don't like about the place is the lighting, it's the neon nightclub-type lighting.

We both had never been to Katana-Ya, so we decided to venture into the lunch rush wait and experience the hype! The store front is very simple. You'll notice a lot of folks waiting around for their names to be called. We signed our name on the list and had a nice conversation out on the sidewalk. It was a nice sunny day, so it was great to chat and enjoy the weather.\n\nWhen we were called to be seated, we walked into the restaurant. It is a pretty narrow space, so it can get a little humid inside if it is a warm day! The team at Katana-Ya were very nice. Despite the feeling of a lunch rush, our service didn't feel rushed at al. They spent time to discuss their menu options and to answer our questions about the restaurant! \n\nMy co-worker ordered the Katana-Ya Ramen with miso. I ordered the chicken katsu curry. I enjoyed the rich, thick, and creaminess of the curry. It wasn't too spicy, and it was just the right level of thickness and consistency I like that allows me to mix well into my rice. The chicken katsu was perfect. cripsy yet moist and juicy when you bite into the katsu strips. The juicy and tenderness of the chicken went so well with the curry and the rice.\n\nCan't wait to return and experience the ramen, but as of this visit, Katana-Ya is on the top of my list for what usually can be pretty generic chicken katsu curries.", "author": "Ben C."}

The restaurant is small but very quaint. They have a short sushi bar framed by neon lights and panels of art featuring storks and gold. The restaurant only has 9 tables total so I can imagine it gets quite busy during dinner rush. I ordered the BBQ pork ramen in a miso broth - EXTRA SPICY. The pork was beyond disappointing.

The first restaurant on the list was Katana Ya, which was recommended by her boyfriend (who also happens to be my boyfriend's best friend--small world right?) for ramen.  I am always up for a piping hot bowl of ramen so I made this restaurant my first destination immediately after checking in to the hotel.    \n\nThe restaurant is in a non-descript building a few blocks away from Union Square.  I was not immediately seated or greeted when I sat down but I'm used to Asian service so I didn't mind too much.  I was dining solo so I sat at the counter and ordered scallop nigiri and a bowl of BBQ pork ramen with salt broth. I was feeling awkard about eating by myself (I am a very social person and eating alone makes me feel sad) but as soon as my ramen came out, I became at one with my bowl of soup.  It was humongous!  The broth was not as buttery smooth as Santouka's ramen but on the Kimberly scale of tastiness I would rank it at somewhere between \"Yowza!\" and \"Hot Diggity Dog!\".  \n\nI have two regrets about this place:\n#1) I wish that the counter space had retractable shields like they do in Japan because I'm pretty sure I ramen bombed my neighbor a few times with all my glorious slurping and unwieldy noodle handling.  \n#2) I wish I was a cow so I could have four stomachs to order a few extra sushi rolls that came so highly touted by the lovely Tara L. and dapper Brett N.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

Figured out what I want within a minute and waited while I just watch the two servers go back and forth for each table. I thought it may make more sense to print the checks and distribute them together rather than print for one table, drop it off, go back to register and repeat. But what do I know? Ten mins later, everyone at the bar was still unserved and we were just looking at our phones trying to hint that we were ready. And we must feel stupid to continuously play with our phones knowing damn well no one has any service since we're underground. No one came. Then they sat a couple down.

I have to say the staff is always warm and friendly as well as welcoming. In addition to the ramen I also ordered the basic spicy tuna roll. Both dishes were great.\n\nMy issues are with the fact that there were fruit flies seemingly everywhere. They were on the soy sauce bottles and around the salt and pepper shaker. They were hovering around my spicy tuna roll when it came. I was endlessly shooing the flies from my table and area around me. I was looking around to see if anyone else was having the same fly experience. I felt like nobody else had this issue and if they did it wasn't bothering them. At one point I had to take my napkin and place it over my exposed spicy tuna roll to keep the flies off! They still kept landing, only on the napkin now. I couldn't get out of there quickly enough!\n\nI had to say something to someone. I got the attention of the waitress and explained that although \"I know there was nothing that you can do now, you should know that there are flies hovering all around my table\" She was apologetic and again I stated \"You should let management know. I know you cannot do anything right now.\" Having felt better for getting that off of my chest I could see in the reflection on the table top that it was quite dirty. Someone had wiped it off but it was TOTALLY streaked and I could notice some food particles on it. I have not written a review in sometime. When I have it is due to a positive experience. While the food was positive, the uncleanliness and overall experience was not so.\n\nAgain, I am sad that I have to report this because I do enjoy the ramen at Katana-Ya but after this last experience I will think twice and hard before going back. ALSO, since I am regularly sending numerous guests to this place for delicious food, I will very likely seek alternative noodles/Japanese venues for my hotel guests. I am giving 3-stars only because the food is that good.

In other words, a super convenient place to go to after you finish shopping! Once I arrived at the restaurant, I was kind of confused about how to place myself in line since I didn't see any designated person taking down names. There's a sign-in sheet on a shelf right outside of the main door and next to the outdoor menu - make sure you don't veer too far away from the restaurant while you wait, because I hear that they place you at the end of the line if you're not there when they call you.

The cutlet was pretty tasty - crispy and tender like a good cutlet should be. The serving size was relatively large considering how much ramen they give you, which really adds to the value of the meal. The ramen was very mediocre. The noodles were cooked well, the broth was decent, the pork was a little boring, and the lack of toppings was a tad underwhelming. Overall, I understand the ambivalence of Yelp reviewers now. It was just a very average bowl of noodles that was pretty filling and only somewhat satisfying.\n\nSERVICE: 4/5\nService was pretty great. I was seated quickly, and was given a water with the menu.

We arrived at around 7 and there was a line, roughly 6 parties ahead of us (guess this place is pretty popular, or it might be the \"a restaurant in the downtown area\" effect). When I asked the hostess/server how long the wait would be, she was very uncertain and just threw out \"30 minutes or more\" after a long \"Uhhhhhhh\" and staring at the wait list... \n\nAnyways, we were seated in about 30 minutes because a lot of people decided to leave instead of wait. The restaurant is super small, and we had a teeny table for four people, literally elbow to elbow. \n\nThe ramen menu is... Interesting. They do NOT have tonkotsu broth and I was very sad. Soy sauce (shoyu), miso and I forget the last one are the only options. Then you can choose rich or light for the broth. Extra spicy costs $1.40 while mild spicy is $.50 I think. \n\nI ordered the combo -- regular ramen, extra spicy, rich miso with a tekkadon ($16). Definitely worth it. The broth isn't that spicy for extra spicy. If you can eat hot cheetos, you can eat the extra spicy. The regular ramen only came with one slice of pork. The tuna was super fresh, and there was a Sriracha-like sauce all over it. I was in food coma status after this meal. Okay, back to the ramen. Overall not too bad, but the noodles were slightly overcooked and seemed thinner than usual. The broth was decent and one of the better miso broths I've had, but I've had better. I also prefer tonkotsu so I was quite disappointed when they did not have it. \n\nMy coworkers had the spicy tofu ramen, which comes with kimchi in it, the BBQ ramen, and the karaage ramen. They were all pretty satisfied and happy. \n\nThis place is a bit...different and isn't the usual ramen place (i.e. They have a kimchi ramen, vegetable ramen with beef broth, ramen with potstickers in them and some other variations that I don't usually see). They also serve sushi, donburi, and some appetizers as well. \n\nI'd come back after work with my coworkers because it's close to the office. However, I wouldn't really recommend this place when there is better in the city (I like Waraku on Post in Japantown, for now at least). But for someone in downtown craving for ramen, sure -- if you don't mind the wait.", "author": "Doris K."}

Oh.\n\nThe portion sizes are fairly large, so have no fear; you're getting a pretty good bang for your buck. My girlfriend and I were debating between Kimchi Ramen and the Spicy Ramen that night, and boy am I glad we settled for the Spicy Tofu Ramen. It came with tofu AND spicy cabbage (which is basically kimchi, right? No? Oh.), so I feel like I got a one-up for the same price.\n\nThe ramen itself is of a much different texture than what I'm usually used to, and while it's still good, I docked it a star because it didn't FEEL like ramen. Dismiss this criticism as you will, but in my mind, ramen has a specific texture and feel that distinguishes it from other noodles, and if you lose that, you lose a big part of it.\n\nStill, the noodles are good, and it's close to a few bars.

My friend and I slid in behind a few ladies that were waiting, and settled in to wait our turn. Another group walked up 10 minutes later and sent one person inside and I quickly realized this line might not be self managed, so I asked the ladies in front of us about the wait list. They pointed to a clipboard and told us that's the way it's done at Ramen shops in the Bay so my buddy goes to add our name just as the girl is walking out with an employee to find it. She lets out a loud \"UGH!\", then adds her name and draws an arrow indicating they were there first. They seat everyone ahead of us, and then the employee looks at the list confused. We explain she added the arrow because she thinks they arrived first. The girl starts yelling that they were and actually went so far as to get up in our face and ask to fight over the next table. I said let her have it, but the employee RELUCTANTLY agrees to let us sit down first. \n\nDue to the way we were treated, I literally almost walked out during all of that. To be honest, I probably should have because it ended up being a bowl of OK ramen. We ordered up agedashi tofu as an appetizer and both of us had a bowl of Rich, Spicy Katana-Ya Ramen, which had gyoza, karaage, bbq pork, kelp, corn, and a HARD BOILED EGG. The egg had us wondering about this place, but the broth was pretty tasty, the other elements in the bowl were good and added nice texture to the soup, and the noodles were cooked just right. \n\nOverall, Katana-Ya was an ok ramen experience and could fill the need for some soupy goodness, but with the service we experienced, I might look elsewhere.", "author": "Michael T."}

As I ducked under the red curtain and walked into the tiny dining area I was transported back to the night I had one of the first legitimate ramen experiences of my life. That is to say, ramen that didn't come from a cup or a square wrapper with a seasoning packet inside. That night rich broth, savory slices of bbq pork, spicy kimchi fried rice and ice cold beer wooed me. \n\nSome experiences are better left as cherished memories.\n\nThis place has not aged well. In the city on business with a few of my colleagues, I recommended we visit Katana-Ya for a bowl of ramen at one of my favorite spots. Most of my colleagues don't have as much experience slurping down ramen as I do and I answered most of their questions, but when asking the waitress about the menu, they received pretty hostile treatment. Not cool. \n\nAs for the food, the noodles were far too undercooked while the pork and the broth (salt/soy/ or miso) were just so so. The only saving grace was the kimchi fried rice. I'll admit this meal at this 3.5 star (it was 4.5 stars years ago) was more disappointing than a bad meal at a 5 star because of the sentimental value, but it would be wrong to attribute this underwhelming experience to the unsuccessful recapture of a meal I had years ago. Since my first visit I've had better ramen, and I'm certain my standards have gone up, but ultimately the food speaks for itself. Whatever magic Katana-Ya once had is gone. And so am I. On to find the next great bowl of ramen in this city.", "author": "Sergio R."}

It seems to me that ramen is generally pretty salty for my taste, and so this spicy ramen was particularly salty. My brother got the Katana-ya ramen, and he kindly let me taste it and it was delicious! I like the regular ramen broth better than the spicy broth because it was less salty! \n\nThe next two visits, I had the special that came with your choice of noodles: udon, ramen, or soba, and your choice of a side dish for about $15 dollars without tax & tip. I chose the regular ramen with a miso base and the Poke don. Loved the ramen AND the poke as well!! Good deal and good food!", "author": "Christina C."}

I understand there were other guests that needs to be tended to and you need to figure out how to seat the next few parties waiting but this little ramen shop probably holds no more than 30 people.  After flagging down a waitress, we ordered 2 katana-ya ramen (fried chicken on the side) and butter corn ramen.  Probably should've ordered the potsticker on the side too as otherwise the chicken and potsticker becomes soggy from sitting in the broth.  \n\nAs I took my excited and hungry self to take the first bite, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off with my ramen.  Was it me or did my ramen noodle texture seem to be like flat noodles?  It wasn't until my friend pointed out that yea the ramen texture was similar to that of cup of noodles. Likewise, she was disappointed but not from the noodles but from the broth as it lacked flavor and richness(perhaps we could've went for the option between light/rich but we were never asked...so we'll blame ourselves for that)  Overall the meal and service was rather lackluster.  I was definitely full from my meal but the quality of food and service was a downer.  I'd come back if I was really craving ramen near Union Square but I'd rather travel elsewhere to get my ramen fix.\n\n$38 for 3 people + tip = $45 (about $15 pp is a tad high for this place)\n\nSorry Katana-Ya, maybe we'll cross paths again eventually but preferably not soon.", "author": "Samuel Y."}

It's not really that good and there's nothing special about it. \n\nTried the Katana-Ya ramen and for $13, it's a pretty big ramen. Too bad it's not amazing or anything. I don't like how the gyoza and chicken is fried and put in the ramen. Why fry it if it's going to get soggy? I asked the difference between rich and light (never heard of that before), and the server basically said rich is creamier and light isn't as salty. I usually don't like salty food but I went for 'rich' because she made it sound better. Oh yeah, and their menu says they add msg in their broth, but for some reason I totally missed that and my friends told me afterward. I should've gotten 'light' because the ramen was very salty and full of msg. Not authentic ramen, in my opinion. \n\nThe server was very forgetful, and didn't make sense. My boyfriend wanted his ramen to be a little spicy and asked for it (about $2 to make any ramen spicy). The server said, oh so extra spicy? He said, no, just a little spicy. She goes, oh sorry we can't do that. Just extra spicy. What? How does that make sense? If you can do extra spicy, you can do normal spicy. Just don't add so much -___-. This conversation took hella long just to talk about the level of spiciness. It was pretty stupid.\n\nI wouldn't have came here if this place wasn't so close to Union Square.

We got to Katana-Ya and the waiting list was already half full, and the outside of the restaurant was intimidatingly crowded with other hungry customers willing to brave the wait. Defeatedly, I signed my name but we thought it'd take forever, so we left to see if Ajisen had a shorter wait. It did not. By the time we got back, our name had already been called. Luckily, once I got ahold of a waitress (which took ten minutes by itself), she called us next. \n\nThe restaurant is small, but I'm not picky about spaces as long as the food is good. My friend and I ordered the soft-shelled crab and the deep fried chicken ramen. The crab was deliciously crispy and hot, and I dipped my crab into the salad dressing (so good!), instead of the sauce they provided us. The ramen came next, and the noodles were delightfully chewy. The chicken was soft, not overcooked. My main gripe is that the broth was a bit too salty and kept me reaching for water, though I prefer too salty over tasteless. The portions are big and definitely worth the $8-10 you spend. Service was fast, although the waitresses took a while to refill water.

Are we millionaires?  Nope.  But we did finally get to try katana-ya...AND we didn't have to wait for a table.  Chances of winning the lotto?  1 in 176 million.

We were greeted within a few mins and the server took our order.  \n\nWifey ordered the unagi don with soy sauce ramen combo...I ordered the uni ikura don.  The server somehow misunderstood wifey and brought her a spicy tuna don...normally we'd just bear down and eat the wrong item but wifey doesn't really eat spicy foods.  we had to call back the server to change her dish.  Yeah, the server wasn't too happy with that.  She looked super irritated and didn't even bother to apologize...heck, she didn't say a single word!  -1 star.  \n\nAnyhoo, once the correct dish arrived...everything was delish.  The ramen was super tasty...we ordered the light ramen which was already heavy...I can't even imagine how the broth is for the other 2.  The noodles were plentiful and cooked perfectly.  The pork was thick and super flavorful.  I freakin love uni...put it on anything and bam, you've won my heart.  \n\nAnother complaint was that we felt super rushed...we eat pretty dang quickly already in the first place.

My hubby had the katanaya ramen with miso & kaarage don and I had it with soy sauce. The Kaarage don was really good and juicy. As for the Ramen it was really really good! The best I've had so far. The soy one was in our opinion better than the miso. The noodles were good and there was lots and lots of toppings!

Fortunately, the service was very nice, and I had a decent meal for a great price. \n\nI got the Katanaya ramen since it seemed to be the special here. The noodles were fine, but the broth left me wanting more. It was unnecessarily sweet even with medium spiciness. Didn't quite get the rich bone or pork fat taste I get from really great ramen places. The fried Gyoza was soggy by the time I got to it, and the chasu was dry and on the leaner side.

While I've been wanting to try one of their enormous soothing bowls of ramen, the wait & location has always kept me away.  Until a couple weeks ago that is!  My co-worker asked if I wanted to go out for some ramen & after taking the street car & getting off on Powell, she called the restaurant & asked how long the wait was & they told her there wasn't one.  When we got there a little before 12 on a Monday there were two free tables left in this tiny place.  \n\nThe menu does offer a lot of choices & I like how I can choose which broth I want & what kind of spiciness.  Even mild has a bit of a kick to it.  I got the soy broth Katana-Ya Ramen medium spiciness ($13).  The Katana-Ya Ramen reminded me so much of the Suzu Ramen at Suzu.  It came with chicken karaage, pork, gyoza & the normal toppings as well as some corn.  Everything was tasty & plentiful!  The broth was flavorful & was pretty spicy.  The noodles were cooked perfectly as well.  The mild got my co-worker coughing & they were nice enough to bring her a bowl of extra plain soy broth to balance it out. The wait time is alright, doesn't seem too long unlike when I went to Suzu in Japantown.  Service was alright but could be improved.

It was overpriced at $13.95 for what I'm about to describe: there was uncooked/raw rice in every bite, the rice was not seasoned (no vinegar) and the presentation was so sloppy (didn't look like any Rainbow Roll I've ever ordered, see photo). The rice issues were proof that the \"chefs\" don't taste their food and the presentation was proof that not only do the \"chefs\" not care, but that there is no quality control. \n\nMy \"Rainbow\" Roll - http://bit.ly/1I19Uu7\n\nA few years ago, my first time here, I dined in with friends for ramen. The chicken karaage tasted like it was fried in oil that was not fresh and it overwhelmed the overall taste since they were just sitting soggy in the broth. My friend said the same thing about the gyoza that were also sitting in the broth. Then in the middle of dinner, we were sitting at the table by the window on the right side (as you're walking into the restaurant)... pieces of the ceiling came crashing down onto our table and our neighbors'. Black water from above also splashed/dripped into my friend's ramen - it had been raining off/on for a couple days when this happened. There was a big enough hole in the ceiling that we could tell there was a storage space above. \n\nBased on these 2 experiences, I won't be going back again.", "author": "Nadine D."}

Price-wise, it's between the LA and NY, only fitting for an SF joint.\n\nSeating is quite limited (use the sign-in sheet if you're waiting), and there's a bar-seating area that's strictly sushi-based. No boiling pots of ramen noodles to be seen.\n\nThe big boy, the Katana-Ya ramen, is a wallet-unhealthy $13, but it comes packed with a few pieces of chicken karaage, a couple deep-fried completely crispy potstickers, half a boiled egg and a slice of pork. And some kernel corn, to boot. There's about 11 other types of ingredient-topped bowls you can get, and there's a huge variety that extends through the rest of the menu.\n\nThe broth was fantastic. We both got the medium, but you can specify if you want the broth thicker or thinner. In retrospect, thick sounds awfully appealing. We also both got the regular shoyu instead of the miso, also a good choice. Like I said, it's a little on the thin side, so if you're interested go thicker, and add spice, if that's your style. If/when I visit again, that's how I'll roll.\n\nThe noodles weren't as curly as I envisioned, and they were just a hair on the thin side. Yeah, you may be thinking, it's just noodles, but the absorption just wasn't quite where I'd have liked it to be. Needed more surface area, imo. Ramen noodles can be substituted for udon or soba, which sounds oddly fun.\n\nThe ingredients send the bowl to over-the-top tasty, but if we're strictly talking soup and noodles, I still side with Daikokuya. The chicken karaage was the highlight of the bowl. Like tempura udon, the crispiness of the chicken (and the dumplings) sober out as the meal goes on, so the first bite varies greatly from the last. The corn was an interesting touch in color, if not taste.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

Truly terrible service.\n\nPerhaps we should have known something was wrong when we tasted the iced tea.  It was our first clue: someone had accidentally mixed coffee into the iced tea, creating a foul-tasting mixture.  But the waiter apologized and brought water, and we're pretty forgiving people.\n\nWe ordered 4 things: an appetizer of gyoza, a bowl of tempura udon for my wife, a bowl of ramen noodles and pork belly for me, and a bowl of plain udon for my teenage daughter.  The tempura came first, followed soon thereafter by the ramen.  Both were very tasty.\n\nTen minutes later, we asked about the plain udon.  Somebody came out from the kitchen and asked my daughter what she ordered.  \"Oh, three orders.  I thought there were only two,\" he exclaimed and disappeared.  But, incredibly, he did not start cooking it.  We asked for it again 20 minutes later.  The waiter went into the kitchen and we could hear them say they forgot.  The waiter emerged and informed us the noodles were \"still cooking.\"\n\nBy the time the noodles came, my wife and I had been done eating for a while.  My daughter tasted them and decided she was no longer hungry.\n\nI asked for the check and my wife reminded me we had never gotten our gyoza appetizer.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that the check was only about $15, and I assumed the waiter had removed everything but one dish to make up for the lousy service.  I paid the exact amount--no tip.  (I am a good tipper--20% for minimally acceptable service--but this did not meet a minimum standard.)\n\nAs we were leaving, though, somebody from the kitchen chased me to the stairs and said they had given me the wrong check.  I said \"they gave me the wrong order too\" and went back to straighten it out.  The young man from the kitchen stated, \"we're taking care of upstairs too.  Don't take it out on us.\"  I paid for everything but the gyoza and even left a small insulting tip.  \n\nIt's not the waitstaff's fault.

It never left a lasting impression, but I have finally made a trek back.\n\nKatanaya has the basics of ramen down. You have shoyu (soy sauce), miso, and shio (salt) that can be varied in richness and spicy levels. Shoyu and miso are easy broths to make as the strong flavors involved can hide many flaws of the broth. I decided on the katanaya shio ramen to really gauge the flavor.\n\nMy broth came out piping hot with an abundance of noodles, two dinky pieces of chashu, 2 gyoza and to pieces of fried chicken. Let's break this bad boy down.\n\nThe broth: (3/5) the heart and soul of ramen. It was chicken based I believe but the individual flavors were muddled and none of the separate components really stood out. Almost as if it was chicken broth with msg. Not that they use msg, or that msg is bad, but the flavors were convoluted. The tare they used, if any, lacked the umami punch that a good ramen should have.\n\nNoodles: (4/5) As the body of the ramen, the vessel for the broth, katanaya hits the spot. They were thick and had the right tooth feel to them. The texture felt a little off, but I enjoyed the noodles. They really held their shape to the very last slurp.\n\nToppings: (3/5) There was an abundance of toppings so I was satisfied with variety. The fried gyoza and chicken were juicy, but the chashu was sliced like sandwich meat and didn't have the unctuous mouth feel that pork belly has.\n\nKatanaya has a dive ramen bar feel and feels dark and dank, but when enjoying ramen you just need a good place to sit and a nice bowl. I enjoyed the bowl, but with SFs ramen game slowly getting better (at a snails pace...) Katanaya is average. Props that it is open late though!\n\nP.S.

Katana-Ya was everything I had hoped it would be.\n\nMy boyfriend and I made a late night visit to Katana-Ya last night; when we walked up we were a little disappointed because there were three parties waiting outside and we expected to have to wait a while to get seated, but within five minutes the host came out, seated the parties ahead of us, and he took us inside with them.\n\nChoosing to sit at the sushi bar instead of the small table for two wedged against the door, we took a look at the menu and decided quickly on what we wanted. I was a little put off by the fact that they charge you $1.40 to make your ramen spicy (Really? Who nickels and dimes for spiciness?), but regardless I chose to make my BBQ pork ramen extra spicy, while my boyfriend went with the Katana-Ya ramen, and we ordered the kara age and gyoza appetizers, as well.\n\nI was really shocked by how fast the food came out - there's no way we even waited ten minutes. In fact it came out so quickly that we had our appetizers to eat alongside our meal.\n\nThe kara age was really hot, juicy, and delicious, and comes with a small salad and a wedge of lemon. The gyoza were good, not the best I've ever had, but definitely tasty and worth ordering with your ramen.\n\nMy ramen was SO good, and man, was it spicy. They weren't kidding with the \"extra\" as the preceding adjective. The BBQ pork was so tender I could pull it apart with my chopsticks, and as a noodle fiend I was very pleased with the amount of ramen in my bowl. The miso broth was a great compliment to the spice. My boyfriend's Katana-Ya ramen was filled with different ingredients - corn, gyoza, seaweed, and meat, among a couple of other things I can't remember - and he chose the soy broth. I tried the soy broth and it was good, but I much preferred the miso over the soy.\n\nWhen we got the check, I was a little surprised to see it was $42. For two bowls of ramen and two appetizers, I thought that was a little steep, especially where the gyoza were concerned ($6.95 for four tiny gyoza is, frankly, a rip-off). I will say that the speed with which we got our food, the friendliness and attentiveness of our waitresses (and the rest of the staff), and the outstanding food made me feel better about the price, not to mention how much ramen we got in our bowls. In the future however, I'd probably refrain from order appetizers, seeing as though you get enough ramen in a serving to be satisfied and you don't really need them unless you're starving. \n\nOverall, a great experience, and I'd love to return.", "author": "Angela M."}

Sat at the bar and ordered their Katana-Ya ramen which comes with gyoza, chicken karaage, chasu, seaweed, green onions, corn. Their miso soup base didn't have a particularly strong bean taste I typically prefer, but that may be due to regional style of soup their chef brings. The noodles are actually pretty close to what I like - al dente and not too chewy, with a bit of that kansui taste which brings me back to memories of a Tokyo trip a few years ago. The rest was a bit underwhelming - maybe I just had too high of expectations from seeing this place on almost every SF ramen list that exists on the internet. \n\nThe egg was fully hard-boiled (bleh) and the gyoza & karaage was soggy - I should've asked them to serve separately. \n\nThis place also needs a bit of clean up. I mean, I don't expect a lot from a small Japanese ramen shop...afterall, the sometimes stuffy, cluttered shop (anyone remember the old Ramen Underground before they moved?) are characteristics of what makes a ramen shop feel like one. BUT there are literally strings of dust hanging as if they're about to fall from the ceiling, directly above where the sushi chefs are preparing their dishes. \n\nIn the end, I really wouldn't wait 1+ hour for a bowl of ramen at Katana-Ya, not really worth it.

I kept hearing how good their ramen is and was thinking it would be less crowded after 10PM when we were feeling peckish. \n\nNo such luck. It was packed, and we were told by the young, unsmiling hostess to step outside in the cold and sign the waiting list. In the meantime, the hip streamed in and out as if they had secret passes. When we were finally seated at the table next to the front window, the smug, disdainful waitress could barely look at us as we attempted to order. In return, I gave her a glare and a deliberate case of small-mouth as I first ordered the $6.50 Chicken Karaage (fried chicken) to share. It was a solid bowlful, not too greasy, and it came with a side salad of mixed greens in a light miso dressing (see photo). \n\nSoon after we were both served our $12.95 bowls of the Katanaya Ramen, which had a grocery cart of ingredients (corn, fried chicken, fried potstickers, seaweed, scallion, barbecue pork, and the obligatory hard-boiled egg) swimming in a miso broth full of al dente ramen noodles (see photos). It was tasty enough, but I wish the focus was more on the noodles and less on the overabundant accessories which didn't quite do it for me. The potstickers, for example, were steaming hot in the broth, and they were hard to eat at that temperature. We ate quickly since the hipsters were staring at us through the window. \n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars...a decent bowl of ramen but over-accessorized for the money \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...this much blacklighting can't be right \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...small-mouth is all I gotta say \nTOTAL - 3 stars...wish I was hip enough to care about this place", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-27", "description": "My San Francisco trip last year with Sharon led us to Katana-Ya. Twice. It was that good. What looks like your hole-in-the-wall dive, is actually a Michelin star ranked restaurant. The \"Bib Gourmand\" category are for restaurants with good food, reasonably priced (under $40 for two). You can see how they select the restaurants here. With my last (and only thusfar) Michelin star visit, the multiple courses were beautifully presented, with complex components, servers around you paying 100% attention. My philosophy: good food is good food. What I thought would be a meal of a lifetime, still isn't the best meal I've had. Best food ends up being random finds, local restaurants, cheap to moderately priced good eats! Which is why it shouldn't surprise anybody that on this last trip to San Francisco with Joe, we were there. Three times.\n\nThe restaurant is located just off of Union Square, a short walk for most tourists staying in the downtown area. The place is tiny, seating maybe 4 at the sushi bar, and maybe 25 - 30 people at the tables. There's a clip board outside so you can jot your name down and menus posted along the windows so you can start perusing. Downside: you have to wait outside and if it happens to be a windy night, it can get cold. Upside: service is lightning fast if you order just ramen and the table turnover is quick. On average, we waited for about 5 minutes with 2 - 3 tables in front of us, each seating for 2 - 4 people. Everybody knows to order fast, eat and enjoy, and get out!\n\nTheir specialty is ramen, multiple different types which you can order in a salt, miso, or soy base broth. If served with cuts of pork, you can choose a rich or light as well. Joe ordered their regular ramen on the first night, miso and light. It came with three slices of chasu pork, bamboo shoots, onions, and seaweed. For an additional $1.50, you can also make the broth spicy, which not surprisingly, he did.\n\nSince this was my third time here, I knew it's all about the Katana-ya Ramen, their over-the-top deluxe ramen. Served with two of their fried gyoza (pork dumplings), half of a boiled egg, two pieces of their chicken karaage (fried chicken), two slices of chasu pork, bamboo shoots, corn, green onion, and seaweed (drool!). With an overload of toppings, I ordered the same broth as Joe: miso, light, spicy. Tip: ask for a plate on the side. I like to take out the dumplings and chicken so they remain crispy! Hand spun noodles, just perfect in texture and in size, a very flavorful broth, served piping hot and within an average of 6 minutes (you bet I timed it), you can't go wrong with this place!\n\nOn my fourth visit, I opted for just the chicken karaage ramen (not pictured) because I love the fried chicken here. It comes with three pieces to compensate for the loss of gyoza, egg, and chasu. Joe's second visit taught him to get the extra spicy ramen (not pictured, imagine an blood red broth), not for the faint of heart! Too spicy for me!\n\nI knew Joe would be eyeing some of my noodles, so I also ordered the salmon and hamachi nigiri. Like all other sushi places here, the fish was fresher than Edmonton's selection. In this case, the sashimi was nicely cut and also had some sort of glaze on top. Warning: wasabi in the middle! On our very last visit (5th for me, 3rd for Joe), there was an overwhelming amount of wasabi! Depends on the hand of the sushi chef I suppose.\n\nMy picks: if you're a big eater, get the Katana-Ya ramen to try all the possible toppings. If you'd like a little more selection in your meal, get the Chicken Karaage Ramen and a few pieces of sashimi or nigiri. I've only tried one roll on last year's trip, which wasn't that memorable, but still good. They have quite a selection there as well but looking around, most people have a big bowl of ramen and a few pieces of sushi. If I ever return (high chance next time I'm in San Francisco), there's a kim chee ramen, spicy tofu ramen, and a selection of udon soups I might venture into. Open for lunch, dinner, and late night eats (last call 1:15am), definitely go here if you're in the area! Also worth the wait if the lines does get long!", "author": "Cindy N."}

I have never had this big a bowl of ramen before, and the taste was amazing, especially the taste of gyoza and karaage with the miso soup. \n\nAfter eating, I noticed that the restaurant was almost full even though we came when it opened at 5 pm.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-19", "description": "Ordered the usual, Katanaya Ramen. Noodles are decent, nothing special. The flavor of the spicy miso was good. The meats were lacking in flavor, but coulda been because of the broth. The egg was terrible, the driest yolk ever, powder-like that made me instantly spit it out. The water made me laugh, it was slightly below room temperature with small, almost melted down ice cubes in the cup. So 4 stars since I'm generous.\n\nNow this is what brought the rating down down down. The wait is actually unreasonable. I don't mind waiting, but 30+ minutes for a single seat? It's more insane since there were empty seats inside. Two empty counter spots. Two empty tables for two. There were about 6 groups waiting after me still, most either single or two. I was let in with another group of two when no one left. I sat at the counter that has 4 seats with only 2 people there, empty seat between them. The couple sat at one table while another table was left empty.\n\nI ordered my food and waited. I looked around the room. I can see people trying to peek inside to see it crowded then be surprised to see empty seats. A group leaves leaving an empty table. You would think they invite another group in, but no. Left empty.\n\nI get my food. The guy next to me, finally gets his bill after almost 10 minutes of waiting since asking for it, leaves. No one replaces him for my entire meal. Then I see why the lack of customer replacement during my meal. I had so much room. I even moved my stool a little to get more spacing. I ate my meal with more than arm distance away from the next person. Glorious for me, sucks for the single person waiting outside.\n\nI notice a group leave, which contained two tables. They clean that one up and invite a couple in. The couple takes the table that was open about 20 minutes ago. While leaving the newly opened two tables still empty. This crowd control works wonderfully since people will grumble outside, but still continue to wait.\n\nI finished and ask for the bill. I ended up waiting for about 10 minutes to pay. In that 10 minutes, I reflected and decided to write this up. Saw my bill and noticed they charged me $1.50 for extra spicy when I ordered regular spicy which cost $0.75. The broth was spicy, but definitely not extra spicy. But $0.75 is whatever. I struggled to decide tip. $0.23, $1.23, $2.23, or $3.23.\nSo I decided $18 on one bowl of Katanaya Ramen and a story. 2 stars for everything besides the food.\n\nP.S. When the guy next to me left the counter, the waitress used a wet towel and cleaned the counter. Then she uses a napkin (the one they give you to wipe your mouth) and dries the counter with it lightly so it doesn't wrinkle or mess up the factory fold of the paper napkin, then places the wooden disposable chopstick on top of the same napkin. So the lesson is, use the inside of the napkin to wipe them lips.", "author": "Avery K."}

Although the portions are huge, the taste is just not there. The broth tasted plain and there wasn't anything setting it apart from just regular noodle soup. My mom and I barely tasted a difference between our two broths. Disappointing. The chasu was overcooked making it chewy and dry! Lastly I don't think the Katanaya is really worth it.

This was my first time here since the new ownership and the food quality has definitely declined.  The ramen broth isn't as flavorful.  Most importantly is the sushi isn't as fresh as it use to be.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll per usual and only ate 2 pieces.

Usually when a restaurant has that many reviews, I get really excited and feel like I have to try the place out. For some reason I've also been told that this is a prime place to go for ramen. But even after reading what fellow Yelpers had to say and preparing myself for the inevitable disappointment, my goodness I'm not sure I really could prepare myself for the real disappointment. \n\nYes, it's a small place. Yes there's a wait. We went around late 8ish and had a very brief 10-15 minute wait which was fine. Plus points for how quickly the ramen was served. Friend and I ordered the Fried Chicken Ramen as per request of other Yelpers. He had the miso broth and I had the salt broth.\n\nFirst comment: ???? Why is there nothing in this ramen??? Three small pieces of chicken karaage and a giant bowl of noodles which was cool. We were both like... wow maybe we should have just gotten karaage and put it in our noodles. Although to be fair and honest, I don't really know what else I should have expected from a Japanese place selling fried chicken ramen. Anyways.\n\nKaraage I have to say was prime. Very prime. Delicious, cooked to perfection, tender meat. Really have nothing to complain about expect for dang it was good. The ramen itself. As reviewers said, there is a TON of oil in the soup and very little flavor. The noodles tasted so bland to me. You've really got to get the holy trinity of noodles right for ramen--noodles, broth, and toppings. And this holy trinity.. meh. Noodles were fine, ... there basically were no toppings except for some seaweed, but oh man the broth. I usually consider broth the dealbreaker/maker for me and this broth was just so ... meh. Tasted like nothing, was very difficult to drink because of the thick layer of oil on top.. and yeah.\n\nIt's pretty expensive, but to be fair this is the city, so I'm not surprised.

The 3 girls in the front were standing up the register gossiping and talking amongst themselves, failing to refill waters or do anything for that matter.

It should've been a sign to walk out when we stepped in only to find people standing there in the front. I was also dining with my grandmother who is partially blind. We noticed them pointing and giggling at the manner and way she was eating. When I looked over, they stopped. It can be seen through the reflection in the mirror. Overall, wouldn't come back again.

We ended up choosing this restaurant because of the bf's and my cravings for some Asian food.\n\nWe had to wait around half an hour before we could be seated.  Because I was on crutches, this probably meant that we were waiting a bit longer than normal, as the bar was open, but we needed a table because I was too short to try and reach the bar.  Regardless, the waitress did ask if I wanted to sit down to at least rest my feet, but I'm a strong, independent (read: stupid) woman and decided to stand during the entire half hour.  Anyways, we were eventually called, and we were able to sit down at a table.\n\nSo, first things to notice.  This place is small.  Lots of tables in a very small area.  If you're in a wheelchair, they might be able to fit you in, but it is cramped.  I was having trouble trying to figure out where to put my crutches.  It ended up being between the bf and myself, where we took turns in elbowing it while we ate in order for it to somehow not fall on other customers.  \n\nThe bf's brother ordered the udon and the crabcakes.  The bf ordered the ultimate ramen that had the corn and egg and, more or less, the entire kitchen sink.  I just had the regular ramen.  Now, the reason why I got the regular ramen was because everyone was raving about this place.  So, I thought, \"hey, if this place is that good, then I should be able to taste it from just its basic ramen\".  For the most part, that's how I gauge other ramen places I go to.\n\nSorry to say, but I was a bit disappointed.  As a background, the bf and I are from southern California, where we have a lot of different options for ramen, Japanese food, sushi, Asian food, etc.  From what I understood, it seemed like this was one of the few ramen places in SF.  So, I can understand why everyone would say this place is the bomb, especially if they haven't been able to venture out of SF for other ramen places.  But, if I had to compare it with other ramen places that I've ever had, this place wasn't that good.  The soup wasn't anything to rave about, the actual ramen was a bit tough, as if it wasn't cooked thoroughly, or cooled too quickly, and the rest of the ingredients in the soup was just meh.  \n\nFor the bf, he definitely enjoyed his kitchen sink ramen AKA katanaya ramen, but only to a certain degree.  The broth was great, the ingredients, such as the corn and the meat and the garnishes were awesome, and likely the best he ever had. He thoroughly enjoyed the fried chicken and potstickers/gyoza, and he normally doesn't like fried stuff in his soup, yet he very much enjoyed it this time, which was a definite first.  And, because the ingredients were so good, he saved the supposed best for last.  But the ramen itself had no soul.  It was just...flaccid?  The ramen just couldn't follow-up with the rest of the bowl...\n\nThe bf's brother, who has lived in Seattle for a good 8 years, and then moved to SF recently, thought this was the best ramen ever, and he seems to be a bit of a regular.  But, he doesn't have ramen down in southern California normally, either.\n\nPrices were okay.  A little higher than what I'd normally pay for in southern California, but this IS San Francisco, where cost of living is definitely a bit higher.\n\nIf the bf and I had a choice, we probably wouldn't come back here when we have a lot more options back home in soCal.

Well, that's what I did when I went to Katana-Ya. On a Sunday afternoon, Katana-Ya was still busy with a mild wait. The place is very tiny and I am sure on a crowded evening, the wait can be unbearable. Luckily, there was no other party ahead of my party of 3. We got seated immediately after about a 15 minute wait and service was prompt. The staff kept coming up to our table asking if we need anything which is great in my book. I ordered the tonkatsu plate which came with a very good portion of deep fried pork goodness, a salad, miso soup and a large bowl of rice. At some other Japanese restaurants, sometimes you gotta ask for extra rice but here at Katana-Ya, I didn't have to.\n\nThe tonkatsu was crispy and already sauced so it saved me time for dipping and re-dipping. For $8.50, it was definitely a great value and I can tell the rest of the items on the menu are all good values. You can get ramen with a small bowl of rice and meat or other types of noodles, ie soba and udon. With nothing but mainly expensive restaurants in the Union Square area, this is a great option for the San Francisco cold and won't hurt your wallet either.

We drove an hour expecting some delicious ramen but instead we got a flavorless surprise waiting for us instead. The broth was oily and lacking any flavor whatsoever, the instant ramen I make at home has more flavor than this place. The noodles were hard and difficult to eat, definitely undercooked and not made correctly. The potstickers sounded like a unique touch to the ramen, however, the first bite was the only bite. The dough was undercooked, I could literally see the flour in between the layers and the filling was oily and tasted like mashed vegetable. The egg, which is typically my favorite part, was probably the most disappointing, not only was it over cooked, it fell out and mixed with the ramen before I even got a chance to taste it!

But the long wait times, cramped tiny space and inconsistent quality, makes it difficult to rate higher than 3 stars.\n\nIn the past the kitchen was able to make a bowl of ramen so good that I'd drink all the broth. Nowadays quality is not the same so I come only for nourishment. Also they make hard boiled eggs, I prefer soft boiled eggs. Hanjuku tamago should be standard when u pay $12 for a bowl of ramen. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BJHkpaHa0ROaLYCav6zsMA/l The sushi is not that great.\n\nSome examples of the inconsistent kitchen, last year was the first time I sent food back to the kitchen because my bowl of ramen was too salty. I think that someone over-seasoned the toppings (meat and veggies) so the combination was too much. Maybe they were training someone new in the kitchen, dunno. And then earlier this year around April, my ramen bowl had zarusoba (yes, the cold buckwheat noodles) instead of ramen noodles. It was late (after midnight) and I was hungry, so I didn't complain and just ate it. Maybe they run out (if so, they should have told me) or someone in the kitchen wasn't paying attention. Customers can substitute soba or udon in any noodle soup, but I didn't request that. Best of SF? not really. The only thing I see in common with Santa Ramen, is that for many years both have one waitress with blond hair. Here it's a Russian girl named Helena.\n\nAnd in case u decide to order the \"grilled salmon donburi\", note that it's NOT a filet of salmon. What u get is minced cooked salmon already mixed with white rice. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XHuaQLKdldnY10JwBSnqTg/l That's a home cooking style, like a kids meal.

It's right across the street from the American Conservatory Theatre on Geary. I would definitely recommend this place... but with one caveat... Be prepared to WAIT... We waited about 30 mins for our party of 3 to be seated. No big deal. Everyone has to wait. I think we got there around 8pm so we were definitely starving by the time we got a table.\n\nI went with the signature Katanaya ramen which came with fried chicken, potstickers, scallions, seaweed, bbq pork, corn and a hard boiled egg. I chose the miso broth, mild not spicy and regular as opposed to a light or rich broth density... So I suggest, while waiting to be seated and standing on the sidewalk, look over the menu and have your order down. Memorize it. Do not deviate from your first impulse on what combination of ingredients to order. Don't doubt yourself. Just go with it.... HA! I'm sure whatever it is, will be tasty.\n\nThe broth was delicious... Cant go wrong with a miso base. The noodles were just the right amount of chewiness. There was a tiny bit of spice to it.... I'm not one for super spicy but I'm sure they can accommodate all you heat-seekers. The fried chicken surprisingly worked very well in the broth and amongst the noodles. My friends said that this is what they read (on Yelp) that this is what they were known for. I'm glad I listened to them. The fried potstickers were also very good tasting. Perfect crunch and taste to compliment the broth. Bbq pork was very tasty and belonged with the rest of the goodness in the bowl. I opted for no corn but the seaweed, scallions and egg were all great together. I definitely left satisfied... I'll definitely be eating here again next time I'm in the city.", "author": "Chuck D."}

For a restaurant that was once upon a time Michelin guide recommended, I expected a quality bowl full of piping hot broth, perfectly cooked noodles, deliciously seasoned and incredibly braised pork. Instead, I got a bowl of what I deemed to be the equivalent of instant noodles made by a poor chap who thinks that Maruchan chicken flavored 'Ramen Noodle Soup' is the same thing as Japanese ramen. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but when it comes to ramen, I'm all about keeping the toppings as traditional as possible, so I knew it was a bad sign when the most recommended ramen dish was the one with fried chicken and the other one with dumplings. Also the fact that they DO NOT have tonkotsu broth still perplexes me. But I sucked it up because I actually prefer miso broth and ordered the regular ramen with miso at a medium spice level. When my food came out, it was beyond disappointing. While the broth was light and hearty, it wasn't spicy in the least bit. The two pieces of dry pork was clearly not marinated nor braised. The seaweed was wilting since they more than likely added it in before they poured the soup in. The egg was half a hard boiled egg that was lost amongst the thick noodles that were so undercooked that every bite left a raw doughy residue in my mouth. Also, who eats lukewarm ramen or soup in general, especially when it's supposed to be fresh from the kitchen? I mean, I don't want my ramen to come out giving me second degree burns, but I would like it to be hot enough to see a bit of steam like it was actually made to order. Am I asking for too much?!?\n\nHowever, what offended me the most was how sucky the service was. My sister and I came in on a chill Monday afternoon around 4pm; there were three other couples inside and about four waitresses \"working.\" We were thrilled because we thought we could be in and out of Katana-Ya and waste little time before our next adventure. But no. What easily could have been a 30 minute pit stop turned into an hour ordeal because the staff is not only lazy but incompetent as well. Yall, it took over 20 minutes just for someone to get us our bill. Then it took another 10 minutes of just sitting there glaring at the other lady in charge of the cashier, waiting for her to swipe the card but she was too busy getting chummy with the old man at the bar. If I was soulless, I would've dined and dashed because they obviously didn't care enough to close me out ergo they didn't care enough to get my money.\n\nPS: if you're unfortunate enough to dine here and want kimchi fried rice, think twice about ordering it. It's bland and the kimchi was bitter af.

My boyfriend and I both got the namesake Katana-Ya Ramen (his with soy sauce broth, mine with miso, and no scallions for either of us). \n\nPros: \n- Possibly the most plentiful amount of ramen \"toppings\" you'll ever encounter on a menu--corn, 2 pieces of fried pork, 2 fried gyoza, several slices of barbecued pork, seaweed, scallions and half a boiled egg. Compare this to Ramen Dojo, where you have to pay an extra $2.50 just for bamboo shoots (which I had never encountered before Ramen Dojo--bamboo should always be included). Let's just say, that's a lot of food!\n- Both the miso and soy sauce broths were tasty, though I preferred my miso\n- The fried pork pieces were quite large and very tender, and the barbecued pork was well cut\n- The noodles appeared overcooked (straight, little curl), but were actually pretty al dente\n- The entire bowl was huge and filled to the top. In other words, big portions for just $11\n\nCons:\n- The fried items should have been served separately so as not to get too soggy in the broth. Being Asian, I've grown up with a lot of fried-items-in-soup dishes, so I sort of intuitively know how long a fried item can be in a soup in order to absorb the flavor without getting too soggy. But a lot of people probably don't know when that cut-off time is and end up with lots of soggy pieces of food. Serving the fried items on the side would allow people to choose how long they want that stuff in the soup\n- They should offer tonkotsu broth for this particular bowl. None of the other broth options perfectly complement the ingredients the way a well-seasoned pork broth would \n\nWe didn't actually plan on going to Katana-Ya for lunch, but happened to be in the area and were craving something hot and soupy on a cold, rainy day. Despite coming at around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon (peak time), our wait was maybe 15-20 min at most.

Yeah there might always be a wait but I don't think I'd be coming back anytime soon. We had their ramen with miso and it was mediocre. Their broth simply couldn't compare to other 3k+ reviewed ramen joints. Moreover, their prices were a bit high for ramen but I guess it's normal for SF standards.

From the outside - and the inside - it doesn't look that amazing; it's super small and a little dark and outdated looking, but the ramen keeps me coming back. \n\nI have not tried anything besides the ramen, so I can't vouch for the sushi and such, but it's the perfect bowl of hearty, salty wonderfulness. I always get the Butter Corn Miso Ramen, and it is a huge portion full of delicious, fattening broth, noodles and meat. For the price point of about $10, you're really getting your money's worth. It's a simple and cheap bowl of non-pretentious ramen that tastes like what ramen is supposed to be. I'm not saying the $14 bowls of ramen at Ramen Underground and Ramen Bar aren't delicious in their own right; it's just that we're talking about different species of ramen here. \n\nI also love that  you can pick which broth base (salt, soy, miso) for every ramen option and how rich you want it. Plus, they have a lot of ramen options.\n\nIt is small inside, so it can get a little busy and they will force you to wait outside as there's no room inside to wait. But, for how busy it can get, the servers are also super competent and fast, so you can get in and out quickly.\n\nSurprisingly, I've been a couple of times during weekday lunch hours, and it's never looked too busy to get a spot.

Staff is so nice. :)\n\nI love their udon, which is fresh, nice, and chewy. It is lighter and comes in a smaller bowl than the ramen, and doesn't come with any meat or bamboo toppings either. It is a bonito (fish) broth.\n\nI love their ramen now, which has a great bounce to it, but I couldn't stand the taste for a while until I tried it spicy -- everyone else loves it, and it's great .. but I grew up on instant ramen, so it was weird at first! It's very, very filling, and comes with meat and bamboo. I sometimes share it with a girl friend if we're not too hungry.\n\nI love their unagi don and almost always get it as my combination side.

It was not bad, not very rich but still flavorful enough. Wasn't mindblowingly good though\nCondiments: 3.5/5 I really enjoyed the fresh wakkame, while most people use a one sheet of dried wakkame. The bamboo shoots were pretty standard, egg wasn't so great. Fried chicken was awesome, very juicy and goes well with the ramen and broth. the gyoza was kinda nasty I must say.

The space, and staff were fine. Not impressive, but no complains. \nThe food just spoke so loudly, that I would never return.\nI got the Katana-ya ramen. The namesake. The variety. Surely it has to be good?\n\nThere are 3 important components to ramen. I generally experience each piece individually in the first 3 bites.\n1) The noodles: The first step is to take a nice chopstick-full of noodles, and straight to my mouth. Mushy. A texture that did not say \"fresh noodles.\" In fact, packaged ramen may have a better texture. These were overcooked and simply not good.\n2) The broth: Next is to take a spoonful of broth and experience this. Now, they have 3 different broth options for their noodles. Miso, soy and salt. Miso felt like the safest option for me (not a huge fan of soy, and salt is a difficult to do right (otherwise you're just drinking glorified seawater.) This was also not good. Perhaps the best part of this bowl in the end, but really not saying much at all.\n3) The gu, the toppings: Because this was the katana-ya, it had the best of all worlds. 2 pieces of chashu (bbq pork), 2 fried gyoza (deep fried potstickers), 2 karaage (fried chicken), boiled egg, corn and seaweed.\nNone of these things were memorable, and most were just bad. Ramen tends to have a poached or soft boiled egg, and not a tasteless hard boiled one. Strike. Flavorless, though tender, chashu pork. Strike. Completely atrocious potstickers that I have no clue what they were doing in my ramen. Strike. That's three strikes already, so the toppings were a disappointment too.\n\nNow, maybe the merry medley of these pieces of the symphony would make something astounding. Something beautiful. Something actually delicious. Well, if you got your hopes up, you probably already saw my star-rating, so no, they did no justice for each other. \n\nPeople are kind and give this 3 or even 2 stars (or crazy and give it 4 or 5.)\nI implore you to save your money; this won't be a delicious meal.", "author": "Hideki M."}

Of course at this point she was really confused and still insisted it was the gratuity. My friend then grabs her phone and uses the calculator on her phone to show the lady the right away to calculate the bill WITH the gratuity. The lady paused and then apologized for her mistake.

It was served on top of tentsuyu broth made of dashi, mirin, and soysauce, which gave the tofu a light sweet and savory flavor. The katsuobushi (fish flakes) and seaweed strips gave it a nice crunch. You MUST eat this dish warm otherwise, it will absorb all the tentsuyu broth making the tofu soggy.\n\n*Chicken Karage ($7.50): Meh! The chicken was crisp, however, the meat was overcooked and had a jerky texture. It wasn't seasoned and there was no accompanying sauce, so it was basically dry, leathery, and flavorless.\n\n*Gyoza ($6.40 for 4 pieces): The menu states it's \"homemade\", but it looked and tasted like it came from a frozen bag from the local Asian market. It wasn't cooked thoroughly so the sides of the wrapper looked and tasted like raw dough. The pork veggie filling wasn't seasoned and there was no gyoza sauce. Instead, Chinese chili oil was which was odd. \n\n*Softshell Crab ($8.50): YUMMY! The tempura battered crab was delicately fried. It had a nice, crispy outer crust and a soft interior. The crab was fresh and very sweet.\n\n*Dancing Bonito ($13): It was GOOD! It was essentially a deep-fried roll filled with spicy fish mix of salmon and tuna and then drizzled w/ spicy aioli and tobiko. The outer layer of the roll was crisp and the fish was tender and moist. The spicy aioli gave it a fiery kick, so no soy sauce or wasabi was really needed, while the tobiko gave it a slight crunch. \n\n*Katayana Ramen w/ chasu, 2 potstickers, chicken karage, boiled egg, and corn in miso broth  ($12.40 + $1.40 for spicy): It was ok. We ordered one spicy and one extra spicy. The waiter screwed up our order and brought out the chasu ramen instead (on the 7x7 list, but NOT worthy to be). When we informed him, he said the other components would be out later. Errr, isn't the potstickers, corn, chicken, and egg suppose to be served with it? At least that is what was shown in the picture.\n\nDo note: Katana-Ya CLEARLY states on their menu that they use MSG in their broths.\n\n-The spicy miso was NOT spicy at all and lacked that savory slightly sweet and rich flavor. The chasu was just blah. Although it was tender, it was completely flavorless. The noodles and tasted like a thicker version of cup-o-noodles. \n\n-The extra spicy miso had the spiciness we were looking for but lacked the savory and rich flavor from the miso, and was more oily then anything. There was an oil ring around the bowl--ECK! The chasu and noodles tasted the same as the one in the spicy miso version.\n\nWhen the other components finally arrived 5 minutes later, we dunked into the bowls. The deep fried potstickers were extra crispy and the extra spicy miso gave it the flavor it needed. After the chicken karage soaked in the miso broths, it wasn't as dry as the app version and took on the flavor from the broths which gave it some seasoning. The corn tasted like can from a corn. And, the egg which is suppose to cooked in soy, vinegar, and sugar was just a plain boiled egg. BOO!\n\nSERVICE:\nThe waiter and waitresses are quick to get your order and quick to get you out of their door. They're NOT very friendly, nor do they seem knowledgeable about the things on the menu which may be attributed to a language gap (Japanese and Latin wait staff). As we asked for more bottles of sake, they kept on giving this a \"WTF\" look and seemed irritated. Hey, they should have been happy; the higher the bill, the higher the tip right?\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nKatana-Ya is more of a hole-in-the wall establishment in Union Square. It's TINY with seating for about 20 people. The tables are extremely small. They use a table that's meant for 2 people for 4 people; so expect to be bumping elbows with your dining companion(s) and have your other arm/elbow hanging out of the table. Not much d\u00e9cor, but posters of sake and alkie advertisements.\n\nSorry Katana-Ya, I really wanted to like you since you claim to have the \"Best\" Ramen in SF and was listed in the coveted 7x7 list, but there's far too many superior restaurants in SF and the Peninsula area that serve \"authentic\" ramen with better service.

I was never really excited about ramen as my history of ramen was always instant Top Ramen, as I'm sure is the case with most of you.  The 1st ramen place I went to I didn't even order ramen.  My 1st true experience with ramen was Santa Ramen in San Mateo, but let's talk about Katana-Ya...\n\nI had the Chashu Ramen (BBQ Pork) and my husband had the Katana-Ya Ramen, both of which are on Foodspotting lists.  Both were so yummers!  I had the BBQ Pork with the soy broth and the pork was really tender and tasty!  \n\nMy husband's Katana-Ya Ramen was with miso broth and spicy green onion.  I just started getting into spicy food so I still like to stay on the mild side of the meter but his was spicier than I probably would be able to handle - yet it was still so good!  It's loaded with so many yummy things like fried potstickers, fried chicken and a hard-boiled egg.  Let me tell you, if you have this for lunch, you won't need to eat dinner!\n\nThe downsides to this place are 1) it's a small restaurant so space is kinda tight, 2) they don't have pork broth like Santa Ramen, which is incredible, BTW and 3) parking in the area sucks but it's in the City, so it's expected.\n\nOther than that, this is a must try!

But when we arrived, I already had a feeling this place was going to overhyped judging from their \"Yelp\" and \"Trip Advisor\" stickers plastered on their front windows.\n\nI ordered the Katanaya ramen which for $12.90 is extremely steep. For $9, I can get a pretty bomb ass bowl of XL pho, so for $13, I was expecting amazing ramen. \n\nUnfortunately, my instincts were correct. The ramen itself was mediocre as it was filled with two potstickers (got soggy fast), a couple of pieces of popcorn chicken (again, soggy), corn, pork, green onion, and the noodles itself. The miso soup was extremely salty and loaded with TONS of MSG. The only upside was the noodles itself which were chewy and in abundance.\n\nBut my reason for the low star is the place itself. The tables are cramped together and it was hard not to bump elbows with strangers sitting next to you. What is worse is that the mirrors they put up on the wall (to give an illusion of a bigger place) actually makes it awkward as you find yourself making eye contact with strangers. \n\nTo put the cherry on top, the worse part of the night was I went home with stomachache.

Upon ordering our food, we asked the man who looked like the manager for water with our food which we never got. Everything(egg and meat) in the ramen was cold except the soup which told me that they just microwaved everything. The food came within 5 minutes which supports the fact that they rushed it.

Make sure your whole party is there because they will not seat you until everyone is there (just qutoing the sign posted on the window). The service is hit and miss.

I either went on an off night or my expectations for ramen are much higher now that I have tried other places. I'm hoping it's the former and their food didn't go downhill.\n\nWe arrived with a party of 6 last night around 11pm. The restaurant was packed and we hung around for a while before getting a seat. We thought that the place would be empty at that hour but we were wrong! In the end we lost one because the wait was too long and he'd miss his train home.\n\nI ordered the Kantanya ramen because it's been a while since I ate here and I wanted to get everything in it. When the food arrived, I was slightly disappointed. The ramen wasn't done to my liking. It tasted slightly overcooked and soggy. The al-dente taste was not there that night... I think the remaining ingredients: fried chicken, hard boiled egg, corn, pork, gyoza, bamboo shoot, and seaweed overpowered the bowl of noodles. Not to mention my entire mouth was left feeling extremely dry from all the MSG that was put into the broth. The menu specifically states \"MSG added\" in case you didn't know.\n\nI think I'll give Katanaya a benefit of a doubt and come back on a different day. I normally go during the day and the experience last night might've been a fluke. I'm hoping to bump their rating back to four stars the next time I'm back.

I was pretty impressed that the owner spoke Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese. \n\nThe ramen can be ordered in several ways: they use one soup broth and add a flavor base from there, soy/salt/miso, from extra tare making it richer in flavor, added spice and etc (generally with a surcharge).

My heart has softened after four years in SF and at least two dozen meals at here.  For being Vietnamese, it's kind of a surprise and a shame that I eat ramen at least five times as often as pho, but such is the case.  The ramen at Katana-Ya is much better than the pho at the Vietnamese restaurants I've had in the city, anyway.  \n\nFor cold days, hangover days, sick days, and days when I just want to be alone, I'll come here for a hot, rich bowl of spicy miso BBQ pork ramen.  The noodles are fresh and chewy.  The BBQ pork is big and tender.  The spicy miso broth is deep and delicious with just the perfect level of kick (for me, but it may be too spicy for most).  This is my kind of comfort.  Ahhhhh.\n\nIf it's your first time, I highly recommend the Katana-Ya ramen, which has a little of everything. I'm not impressed by the sushi or sashimi, and you mind as well just order ramen like everyone in here (it must be good if everybody is having it, right?).

The tofu was perfectly deep fried while the middle still remained moist.  The broth the tofu was placed in was absolutely yummy!

The inside was barely flavorful and didn't taste fresh at all.  It did not come with the usual gyoza dipping sauce but instead was accompanied with chili oil.  \n\n*Chicken Karage - It consisted of large pieces of chicken and salad.  The chicken was okay but the pieces were way too large.\n\n*Softshell Crab - YUM!  I'm not usually a fan of softshell crab but this one was unbelievably sweet!  Definitely a must try!\n\n*Katana-Ya Ramen (#12 on the menu) - The menu CLEARLY states that the ramen comes with chasu (bbq pork), gyoza, chicken, corn and an egg.  However, when the ramen arrived, the only thing was chasu.  When we asked the waiter, he said he would bring out the rest on a SEPARATE plate.  When you look at the menu, the picture clearly shows you that it comes in the bowl.  We ordered one bowl mild and the other spicy (there's an additional cost for spicy).  The mild had NO spiciness to it and I ended up combining the two ramen soups in my bowl to get the amount of spiciness I was looking for. \n\nSERVICE:\nService was VERY spotty.  As we walked in the waitress was quick to seat us.  As she came over a couple of minutes later to take our order, we said we were still waiting for one other person.

I have tried tons of places in SF Bay Area, and this one was the worst so far, I have't tried rolls or sushi there, so can't say anything about it.\nI wouldn't be writing this review tho if service there was at least decent. The lady who seated and served us in the beginning was extremely rude, I thought \"Oh well, we all have bad days, or maybe it's just us particularly who she was treating like this\", but while we were eating 4 people came in and were seated by that lady near us.. and yes! She treated them just like us. They were probably not as hungry as us, so they just stood up and left immediately, good for them! If I wouldn't be starving-I'd leave right away as well. \nThere was another super nice waiter who brought us our bill, he was very professional and friendly and I wish he'd serve us in the very beginning.\nI'm not coming back to that place ever.", "author": "Kseniya S."}

The correct answer is, \"Of course.\" But, I am not going to be offended if you glaze over and just check the star rating. In the interest of expediency, I'll give it to you short and sweet: It's alright. It'll scratch your ramen itch but it won't, likely, make you lose your breath.\n\nLong answer: fried chicken ramen. Sounds ridiculous, right? Life changing, right? It's not. It's ok. And that's... frustrating. I mean, come on. Fried chicken ramen. That just sounds like something you have to have in your life. But, the description is the most exciting part of the experience. After you choose your protein, you choose your broth, consistency and spice level. It's all very particularized and I'm not opposed to the idea that maybe I did something wrong. But, I'm pretty awesome at flavor combos, so I don't think that's it. Fried chicken protein, miso broth, regular, and medium spice. The bowl came out and the portion was huge. Try as I might, I couldn't make a dent in it... but that could be because I wasn't that inspired. My broth was a bit more bland and watery than I expected/wanted and I had more greens and bamboo in the bowl than meat. I get it: costs count... but if you're advertising a protein, give me the protein. Good for groups. Fun for late night. A bit blah for ramen. Hope this helps.", "author": "Johnny T."}

With all the reviews this place has garnered, I was hopeful this could be an option for my ramen cravings.\n\nI was a bit surprised - no Tonkatsu ramen option - just \"standard\".

The broth was definitely fresh and had a nice assortment of vegetables and toppings but lacked flavor.  And the texture of the actual ramen was similar to store bought.  Although the single slice of BBQ pork was tender and tasty...yes 1 slice for you $8 bowl of ramen.  No egg but I did see others with a hard boiled egg - may be optional or available in a different bowl.\n\nThe restaurant is small as are the tables but it is a ramen shop so it adds to the atmosphere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "This review is based purely on service (moreso lackthereof.)\n\nI've been here several times before. It's good ramen for the price and location (touristy Union Square). I live very close by in downtown, so I decided to take a friend out for a visit.\n\nAfter being sat, I noted quite angry service by the lady, who had a short temperament during the ordering process. I let this slide -- everyone has a bad day. We got our orders but they forgot to give us a few utensils and requested bowls. I waited patiently to get their attention -- they're busy, ok it happens.\n\nThen they send out the wrong adjoining course -- some spicy tuna bowl. (I unfortunately cannot eat spicy foods.) I alerted the lady, and rather than being apologetic, she defensively tells me, \"This is what you got.\" I said \"No, I got the tuna and salmon bowl.\" And this started a scuffle, where the lady kept asserting herself aggressively and a gentleman who claimed to be the manager told me to \"calm down\". First off, no one should ever treat a customer defensively and accuse them of ordering wrongly. EVEN if that were the case (which it wasn't here), the attitude should be of understanding, not of defense. Second, the manager did nothing to calm the situation besides assert that the lady apologized (if she did, it was a sassy, sarcastic, passive aggressive apology).\n\nI don't want an apology -- I want things to be fixed and fixed quickly. They kept point at a menu above my head as I was sat, so I stood up to point at what I ordered, and I was pretty much demanded to \"just sit down\". This was simply appalling. I was appalled of the rudeness and unprofessionalism displayed at this restaurant. It's absolutely unfortunate because this is a decent ramen place and we all like ramen. Nonetheless, you, the viewer, need to be aware that this type of (dis)\"service\" does exist and that buyer beware.\n\nI stood up and left -- the only way I can hold this restaurant accountable for their misdeeds (well and write this review -- my first negative review.)\n\nDon't bother waiting at this joint.

But I'll say it's definitely worth the waiting. \n\nMe and my friend got a table for four so it's quite spacious compared to other small two-people tables. They have really good combo deals where you can order a ramen/udon as an entree and a side dish such as kimchi fried rice or sushi rolls with an average price of $13. We got gyoza as appetizer, which is my all-time favorite. I got the Deep Fried Chicken Ramen with miso sauce and mild level of spiciness. As a Chinese, I'm pretty picky about Asian food. I have to say that this restaurant is pretty authentic. \n\nWould like to come back and try the sake next time! :)", "author": "Xiao L."}

I tried their Katana-ya Ramen which has corn, bbq pork, egg, spinach, fried chicken, and fried gyoza in it. I got the miso broth light. You can get light or rich and I chose light. \n\nThe ramen itself was good with the right chewy but firm texture. The broth was good but not quite as flavorful as I am used to. My favorite place for ramen right now is Shoki II in Sacramento. My brother-in-law, who had never had ramen from a restaurant before thought it was good. \n\nI would say the light versions of their broth still need a little more flavor. I also don't like that they charge you $1.90 to make it spicy. Most places don't charge you to make it regular spicy or hot spicy. \n\nI plan to return and try their rich Miso broth as well. If I like the rich miso broth better than the light, I will consider bumping this to a 4 star review. I might be a little harsh here but really ramen is all about the broth. This is definitely a good place for lunch or a quick dinner and you get pretty good value for your bowl of ramen.", "author": "Jacqueline C."}

Katana-Ya, however, is an exception to that. And comon now, the restaurant is named after a freakin' samurai sword afterall. (+Cool points right there!)\n\nSuper Spicy Roll - [http://s3-media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y6Ap-svp6Hk4rdhoomKXqg/l.jpg]\nWe ordered this as an appetizer since my girlfriend and I love spicy food and with a name like that, how can you resist? It's like they subliminally target fire-eaters! (and you can't argue since it's only $6.50 either). We got 8 pieces and if you do the math, that's a steal. It was a collabo of salmon, hamachi, and spicy tuna, topped with their homemade spicy sauce. It wasn't dramatically spicy but with the wasabi, it had a nice kick. The chef's didn't skimp on the fish either, which was a major bonus!\n\nKatana-ya Ramen - [http://s3-media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nZym9koGT0Tbos_IqikkYg/l.jpg]\nI ordered this a few months back and I returned for more! The Katana-ya ramen consists of: chashu pork, fried gyoza, fried chicken, half of a boiled egg, and topped with corn (I don't remember the corn being there the first time but whatever, interesting touch). I chose the miso soup base -- but forgot to ask them to make it \"rich\" for texture which didn't compromise the ramen, at all.  The quality of the ramen is not your cheap 10c instant noodles either, which I get from other ramen spots..\n\nChashu Pork Ramen - [http://s3-media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ru0jaLFkBc05z4m5le6n1Q/l.jpg]\nThis was my girlfriend's dish. She, being the more intellectual individual in all things ramen, ordered her broth, rich (which you can definitely tell the difference here). It also came with 3 big portionate slices of the chashu pork and a few other fix-in's. I can't recall because I was too busy enjoying mine.. \n\n\nThe only downer is that Katana-ya's a small little hole-in-the-wall so seating will be limited. Luckily, by calling ahead of time and asking if there was any wait, we got to snag two seats at the sushi bar (at around 7:30PM) with no wait. I felt very fortunate because as I was enjoying some delicious ramen, small groups of hungry fanatics were signing the wait-list and pacing back and forth on a nippy San Francisco night.", "author": "Albert L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-04", "description": "With about 2,100 reviews already in the books (server?), what more could I say about Katana-Ya that hasn't been said before?  I'm pretty sure not much.  But at least now I can be part of the crowd!\n\nAlthough it may not be the one listed on the 7x7 list, the Katana-Ya ramen is the one I usually get...because it's SO GOOD.  Restaurants, take note - this is how you do it when you brand your name on a dish (a few places I won't name could use the advice).  Loaded with gyoza, chicken karaage, roast pork, egg, corn, and the usual array of green onion/seaweed/bamboo on top of the noodles, it's one hearty ass bowl of ramen.  Despite all of those tasty goodies though, it's just not the same without the spicy broth.  Granted that it wasn't actually all that spicy, but it still provided some delicious flavor.  And besides, who wants to start sweating while you're eating?  Save it for the gym.\n\nThe overall menu is fairly extensive, with the different varieties of ramen, sushi and dinner combinations you can get (ramen plus appetizer/small dish, for example).  However, I admit I've never really taken a hard look at everything they have to offer since I mostly stick with the ramen (and usually one variety at that).  It certainly sucks that there's almost always a line due to the limited seating, and that parking in the area can be relatively scarce though.  It's a good thing the delicious food and their late hours help to compensate for those shortcomings.  \n\nWhile I'm not really sure how Katana-Ya stacks up against the other big ramen joints in the Bay Area (Santa, Santouka, and Ramen Dojo come to mind), it's certainly the best in SF for me.  Then again, that probably doesn't come as a surprise considering the sheer number of reviews and the relatively high praise.  I guess the only real surprising thing about my review is how long it took for me to write it.", "author": "Mike L."}

Too many people had told me that this was their \"favorite\" Ramen in the city so I just had to... HAD to try it. Since we were waiting, we knew what we wanted and ordered as soon as we were seated. The place is small and packed (no wonder there is a wait list) but the staff were moving quick and they were friendly. Ten minutes later, our giant bowls arrived: my friend ordered the soy-based BBQ PORK RAMEN while I had the miso-based GROUND PORK & RED CHILI RAMEN.\n\nPROS: Spicy, good noodles, huge portion\nCONS: Fatty pork, cold tofu cubes, lack of veggies.\n\nThe soup was hot but the tofu was cold! This shocked me as I was not expecting cold tofu. While the broth was a great color and flavor, the pork was fatty, the tofu was cold and there was a distinct lack of veggies in the bowl other than a few green onions on top.

Getting seated by a cute waiter, I already knew that I wanted to try out the ramen, being the Japanese foodie fanatic I am.\n\nNot really knowing what ramen to get (and not reading any reviews of the place, but noticing the LARGE amount of reviews), the regular ramen in miso called for me.\n\nNot mind-blowing, like Daikokuya or Orochan, but not cheaply made like Ajisan, Katana-Ya wasn't bad. The broth and toppings were just your typical ramen toppings, but the ramen itself, I have to say, it's does hold a candle to other places.

It had all the ingredients a regular ramen had (pork, bamboo shoots, wakame) plus 2 gyozas, 2 pieces of chicken karage, and half of a marinated boiled egg.

The hardboiled egg is cold, the yolk is grey and crumbles into dust in your mouth. The noodles are just . . . there.

We both really liked it. It's comparable to Orenchi's Karaage Chicken in Sunnyvale.\n\nFor our main entree, we both ordered the Katana Ramen. I asked to make mine spicy though. They offer two levels: medium or extra spicy. I stuck with medium since my stomach was already suffering from all the Hennessey I had the night before. The Katana Ramen came with corn, sliced pork, fried chicken, pot stickers, and bamboo shoots.\n\nVincent didn't really enjoy his broth much. We noticed on the menu that they offered a \"rich\" and \"light\" version of the broth. The server didn't ask us which we wanted, but he felt as though his was a bit bland. \n\nWe both agreed that my broth was tasty. It wasn't too spicy by any means. I would definitely upgrade to the next level of spicy next time. Sadly, I didn't really enjoy my ramen as much as I thought I would. \n\nFirst, my egg was hard boiled instead of soft boiled! Second, if chicken is fried, I feel like it should be eaten dry. My fried chicken became soft chicken while it was in my broth. The potstickers were quite mushy. It still tasted good, but I would rather have those two things crunchy. I definitely didn't consider any of this when I ordered it. I just thought, \"Whoa potstickers and fried chicken and ramen all in one? Down!\" I'm definitely willing to go back and try other choices in the future.  \n\nI do appreciate the fact that the Katana Ramen offered a lot of variety in one bowl.

Fine. We waited, and after about 10 min, I asked the same rude server/hostess for an estimate wait time. Ignored. Three times, with increasing loudness. No response. Fine.\nAnother server came out and started calling off names. I'm literally standing 2 feet away and I couldn't hear her because of how softly she spoke, 2 groups missed their calling and they had an argument, further extending our wait. 20 min, and they finally had a table ready for us. She walked us in, no sorts of welcoming gesture or Hello or welcome and pointed to our tables, and walked away. \nShe came back, less than 30 seconds later asking if we're ready to order. 30 seconds, without a menu?

It's not. \nBy the way, I'll make a quick rundown of the foods I was able to try. \n\nKatana-ya ramen: Pasty, bland broth. Noodles were beyond firm. It was really the basic ramen, they just add fried chicken and gyoza. \n\nUna Don: Eel over rice. Rice was good. Eel was way overcooked, and there was no eel sauce to accompany it. \n\nPlain udon: PLAIN. Broth literally tastes like water. The only flavor came from the veggies they put in it. \n\nSuper spicy Don: probably the most decent thing on here. They gave a fair warning, though.

Surprisingly we didn't have to wait at all. I ordered the shio bbq pork ramen (rich) for $11. It came out in a large and wide bowl with the usual toppings of green onion, bamboo shoots, seaweed, and pork. The bbq pork ramen is pretty much their classic ramen with extra pork. It. was. terrible. The pork was tough and lean (it was dying for some fat), the broth was dilute and NOT rich like I asked for--it's an option on their menu--and the noodles were unmemorable and perhaps a tad overcooked.

It's good for a late bite after drinking. But if you're venturing for some decent ramen and you have taste buds for ramen--stay away. I am sooo disappointed with Katana-ya.

Something so wonderful about having a hot bowl of ramen and feeling short wafts of cold air rush by.\n\nMy typical order is the shoyu ramen and a hamachi kama. The broth is very flavorful but not overly salty and the thin sliced pork is always tender and savory. I always wish I could have an extra slice. The noodles are always slighty chooy and never overcooked. Part of the reason why I regular this place is because the noodles are so consistent.\n\nThe hamachi kama is deep fried instead of grilled like most other japanese restaurants prepare, but I have to say, the frying keeps the kama extra moist and as an added bonus it doesn't take nearly as long to prepare. It comes with a side of ponzu-like sauce and makes for an excellent appetizer.\n\nThey also serve ramen with otger combinations of small donburis so you can try a bit of everything if you go in small groups.

I went by what everyone said and at that time, there weren't a lot of  \"Ramen-ya\" in San Francisco. Since then, I have been to countless ramen joints and have even ventured into making my own and have come to understand the affinity that many have for that bowl of soup.  \n\nI have been to Katana-Ya several times after writing this review as well so I think it's a good time to write an update.\n\nThe thing that wowed me at the time was the chasu but it was elevated by a false assumption. I thought the pork was simply boiled with the broth and somehow miraculously retained a lot of the flavor. In my experience, boiling meat is for the purpose of adding flavor to the broth and the meat doesn't really keep any of its own flavor. Well, I've experimented with making my own chasu and it turns out that it is marinated in soy sauce, mirin and sake and either roasted or slow cooked for a long time before slicing and topping it on the ramen. This was ignorance on my part when I raved about it in my original review. \n\nI don't mean to take anything away from Katana-Ya but there are apparently a lot more factors in what goes into a bowl of ramen than I had originally understood myself. \n\nIt's all about the holy trinity:  the broth, the noodles and the toppings. Of course the broth is really where it's mostly at.\n\nSo as for their broth, their shoyu (soy sauce based) broth is good, but not great. I've honestly had much better broth in the places south of San Francisco (Ramen Dojo, Himawari to name a few). I've tried the shio (salt based) and it too was good but not great. I have yet to try the miso broth but I have tried the Katana-Ya ramen which was a butter-corn ramen with all the fixings. It has kara-age (fried chicken) AND chasu. It's a pretty hefty bowl of soup too. \n\nAll in all, what really makes their ramen stand out is the chasu IMO and for that alone, everyone should check this place out. But with the proliferation of new ramen places in the Bay Area, Katana-Ya just doesn't hold a candle to the rest of the competition located south of the city (which people will take a pilgrimage to if they absolutely had to have a superior bowl of ramen) but is still one of the better joints in San Francisco and should be worthy of high praise based on their portions and yummy toppings.\n\nHalf a star gets deducted.\n\n4.1 stars", "author": "Angelo B."}

You can tell them how rich you want your broth (aka, how much fat you want in it, but they refer to this as \"density\") or what type of broth you want (miso, soy sauce), as well as the type of noodles you want (regular ramen, soba, udon).  So you have the freedom to customize your bowl of ramen.\n\nThe bowls are ginormous. I always share & make the other person eat most of it. And of course, MSG is added.

She was like, \"You're going alone?\" I was like, \"Girrrrrrrl! I'm hungry! Ain't nobody got time to wait for a date!\" \n\nIt's THE BEST! No wait, because it's just me, so I just walk right up to the bar and immediately order my ramen. It's funny because I think the dude next to me totally had the same idea.

This place gets in your blood. I typically order the Katana-Ya ramen with the boiled egg, seaweed, pork, fried chicken, and wontons. I also order it medium spicy with miso broth. Uh oh. Here comes the craving again! I did however order it extra spicy and that was a little much. Not that it was too spicy, I just wasn't able to taste the miso flavor anymore because it was masked by the pure red sauce. So I suggest medium spicy. I also suggest ordering a cold dish like sashimi so that you can wait like 5 minutes and calm your hunger down while you wait for the broth to cool off (or else you will burn your tongue due to sheer impatience...true story.) \n\nAND, it's open late!

Was surprised to be initially directed downstairs to their new location.\n\nBut this review is about how they have gone down the drain for both service and food. The food and ramen here was not that good to begin with, but this was opened late when I needed an after midnight meal. My visit this time saw a sparsely filled KatanaYa that is usually full or had a lot of customers in past visits. This was not a good sign and the staff looks completely different, indicating new management. The new staff prove to be both poor, unattentive and most of all rude -- they looked out of place at a Japanese ramen place and looked like folks who should be working at a bar as bouncers.\n\nOn this visit, I ordered a cold tofu ($3.95) and a 49er roll ($12.95). The server brought the roll without a sauce dish for the soy sauce and wasabi. I had to flag the server twice before he finally brought a sauce dish that was actually a tea cup plate, not the traditional sauce dish. This indicated the place was no longer authentic with such poor attention to details.\n\nThe server was completely unattentive and lazy, spending time idling away while not paying attention to the tables. I had to call him several times to refill my water, he would for example refill water at the table next to me but completely forgot to check on my table.\n\nThe worst part was when the bill came. I was charged $10.95 for the cold tofu that was $3.95 according to the menu. I started to suspect if the new restaurant management was trying to pull some type of \"bait-and-switch\" on me. I told the server to bring the menu so that I can check the price of the cold tofu. Knowing that I am about to call their bluff, the server went to speak with his manager, a fierce looking man who looked more like a bouncer than a ramen place manager. I pointed out to him that the menu price stated that the cold tofu was $3.95, not the $10.95 written on the bill. I told him to please not charge me the wrong price.

I told him that KatanaYa has now gone down the hill since moving to the new spot and with the new management. At this point, the inattentive and lackadaisical server started becoming rude and attempted to threaten me. I told them this lousy service is why they have very few customers now compared to the past and that as a long-time customer who have made many visits, this would be my last visit due to the rude service and lack of an apology for charging me the wrong price. The rude server then replied that they have plenty of customers and do not need me to be a customer here! Amazing! Good way to chase away your long-time customers!\n\nI wont be patronizing KatanaYa any longer, as there are other spots around the area that have both better service and food while remaining open past midnight.\n\nI left a 5% tip with comments about the poor and rude service!", "author": "L V."}

You're by no means the best ramen I've had, but you're up there, and quite satisfying after a night out on the town (and much better than the options around you!).\n\nI love their combo options though: order a main noodle dish, and choose from any number of sides dishes, including things like curry rice, chirashi, and rolls, at a discounted price. Something like $13 for a combo leaves me with enough food to last a second, if not occasional third meal, so there's great value here too (don't ask me why I'm ordering that much so late at night). Having been here numerous times now, all the food I've tried (regular miso medium spicy, curry rice, soba in soup, among others) has been quite tasty. But, like many others have mentioned, the broth isn't quite as rich or deep as some other places I've been.\n\nAnd the wait does tend to suck, especially if you're coming at a late post-drinking hour.

I wouldn't say it was bad, but at least the ramen I had was pretty mediocre.\n\nRAMEN:\nI got a Katanaya Ramen with miso soup base. The difference here than other places is I usually get chashu and tonkatsu broth, but I was open to different styles. They have bbq pork and miso instead, and I think a few other broth options? Another difference is they put fried gyoza in the ramen! That was actually pretty good.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was I didn't really like the noodles. I was worried I wouldn't like the bbq pork, but it fit right in and was pretty tasteful. I didn't really have a strong impression of the broth, it wasn't good or bad. I can't pinpoint something exactly, but overall this ramen was a little bit disappointing. \n\nIn my honest opinion, I felt like this could easily be a good bowl of noodles -- but not ramen. It didn't taste like ramen to me. \n\nDONBURI:\nWe also got a pork belly donburi, it was a special on the front of the menu. The meat was tender and I really liked it! Medium sized portion, definitely too big for a side haha but that was our mistake. \n\nSERVICE:\nI am never one to really care about service, as long as they sort of do what they're supposed to. However, at this place, no one really tended to us until we said something, to the point where we felt invisible. Anyway, we told someone we were ready to order so he got a waitress for us. She was kind of confusing, seemed a little unsure of things, and mixed things up easily. Other servers seemed to know what they're talking about though. \n\nServers seemed nice, but, the whole experience we had with service was pretty bad. \n\nOVERALL:\nI think if you have no expectations or standards for ramen you might like it.

Decided to try Katana-ya, because it was nearby my hotel and I had read very good things about it.  Arrived around midnight on a Friday.  Brief line, but since I was solo, got in quickly.  First off, my server was horridly bad.  Had to ask her four times for water, before I finally had to ask someone else for it.  I also had to remind her about the beer I had ordered a couple of times.  Every time I tried to catch her attention, her face was buried in her phone.  She should really be let go.  But, I never let such stuff overly influence my rating of any place, because it's really about the food.\n\nI wouldn't call myself a ramen snob, but I know what makes good ramen.  This was not it, given the hype I read online.  The soup was definitely made on a reasonable base, but had a strong ginger flavor...not a typical component of a ramen base and resulted in an unbalanced soup.  The chashu was cut way too thick, was dry (very little fat), and lacked flavor.  The men was OK...one problem was they seemed to have twisted it into a tight ball, so it wasn't really swimming in the soup.  Took me a while to untangle it and let the men fully swim in the soup.  Had I not untangled it, my chopsticks would've pulled up a huge \"men-ball\", instead of small portions.  I tried their chicken karaage, which was just OK.  \n\nFinal judgement, Katana-ya is OK...clearly better than many of the ramen places out there.  But if it consistently ranks among the top five in SF, then I really feel sorry for SF residents, because it's not THAT good.  I've always argued that it's very difficult to find good ramen in the US.  I live in LA and among the hundreds of ramen places here, only a handful I would consider to be excellent.

Approximately 30 minutes later, we were seated in a cozy little table for four. My friend ordered the ramen with uni and we got an extra bowl so I could try some (I wasn't very hungry and I never eat huge servings anyways). My other friend ordered the ramen with everything and then a sushi roll, both of which he shared with our fourth friend.\n\nAbout 15-20 minutes later, our food came out. This was my first time trying uni, but it was nice and sweet, yet still reminded me of the sea. According to my friend, this place serves good uni (when you get bad uni at other places, it's really terrible). The ramen was also delicous. The noodles were of the perfect consistency and the broth was flavorful, without being too fatty. The other two who shared the ramen and sushi roll also seemed satisfied when they finished.\n\nOverall, this is quite a nice gem amongst all the touristy places.

Also tried my friend's miso broth ramen, it was ok - not as good as the salt broth.\n\nHere's the point of no return for me: the most recent time, I was having lunch with my friend. This time, the ramen was especially not satisfying, so i was already not-so-happy. My friend went to pay, and I put the tip on the table. My friend paid with cash at the register, got her change, and just as she turned to leave, the lady stopped her!!!!! She kind of signaled our table (right next to the register) and said \"Tip\". What.the.EFF???!! This has never happened to me or my friend before and was a major, major turn-off.\n\nMaybe if they served really, really good ramen, I would overlook this. But they don't. So I'm never coming back again. Goodbye Katana-Ya!", "author": "Amy L."}

The broth was ok, but underflavored.  The gyoza was good, a mix of crispy and soggy from soaking in the broth.  The chicken was average.  It didn't work as well sitting in broth and getting soggy.  \nThe rest of the soup had mushrooms, scallions, and BBQ pork.  i found the pork a bit too salty which buried the sweetness that should be there.\n\nOverall a good meal.

I was just so happy that there wasn't much I could say. But I feel as though I should beef it up a bit.\n\nI have been to Katana-Ya several times now...ok basically every time I am in or near Union Square. The first time I ate there was after a whole day of wandering aimlessly around SF. It had been a great day and now my friends and I were hungry. One problem...it was 12 AM. My friend remembered hearing about Katana-Ya and we made our way over. We were immediately astonished that there was a group of people waiting to be seated. At midnight?? If you are coming to this restaurant at pretty much any time you will have to wait. But it is SO worth it. \n\nThe restaurant is small and kind of cramped, but it makes it sort of cozy. The staff there is incredibly friendly and helpful. One time right before halloween a few friends of mine and I went here and there were two gumby's seated at a table. The staff seemed to be huge fans of gumby and kept talking to them. It was a lot of fun. (Ok, so my friend and I were gumby...)\n\nThe food I've tried (i'd recommend all of it!)\n\nThe Fried Rice: Hands down some of the best fried rice I have ever had. perfectly cooked and seasoned. Its just something you have to try.\n\nThe Ramen: Delicious! The miso broth was my favorite. The best in my opinion is the fried chicken ramen. The fried chicken here is just out of this world. Perfectly battered. The texture is amazing. It is a great meal on its own, but with the ramen it will blow you away.\n\nThe Udon: Some of the best udon noodles I've tried. This might be my favorite meal here....but man is it hard to choose a favorite.\n\nThe Sukiyaki Don: A bowl of rice with meat, veggies and an egg on top. i was curious about this dish and didn't quite know what to expect when I ordered it. Now I'm hooked. I've gotten it multiple times and one my friends pretty much exclusively orders this when we come here.\n\nMy only problem with this restaurant is deciding what to order. I love everything so much that I wish I could just order it all. When I come here I always wish I was a cow and had four stomachs.

A friend recommended I try Katana-ya; so off I go. \n\nWalking in to Katana-ya is nothing to write home about. It's a little nondescript place, a bit aged, but fully functional.  They seated me at the sushi bar (party of 1) and the waiter quickly welcomed me and got me a drink.  The service was quick.  I was a bit confused by the house, techno-music they were playing with its overly mixed synthesized loops.  The night club sound experience with the aged ramen noodle house was curious. But I'm here for the soup. \n\nWhile I looked over the rather large menu, I ordered a couple Himachi nigiri.  I use Himachi as my benchmark for comparing sushi places, and I was very pleased with their fish - fresh, buttery, light flavors. Even the little bed of rice was well prepared and tasty. I might have to return to try out their other sushi offerings. \n \nThey don't offer tonkotsu here, but have the standard miso, soy and veggie broths.  I ended up selecting the house special Katanaya Ramen - a bowl with miso broth and a little bit of everything in it.  Now, when I say everything, here it is:   fried chicken pieces, fried dumplings, hardboiled egg, BBQ pork, corn and seaweed.    I will admit, I've never had many of these items in my ramen, so interested to try something new. \n\nAnd I liked it. A lot! The soup was rich, spicy and maybe a little bit fatty for some, but I like that. I had to stop myself just short of lifting that big bowl to my face to drink the last drops.  The noodles were fresh, had a pleasant flavor with good bite. The fried dumplings were a great tasty addition (may I have some more please), the egg and corn fit well, I even wished there was a little more seaweed in the bowl because I liked the flavor when eaten with the noodles. The fried chicken pieces were slightly tough to bite through, but tasty.  \n\nI'm not a ramen expert by any means, and taste is certainly subjective, but after trying lots of ramen at many houses around the world, I think I can distinguish a good bowl of soup - I really liked this bowl of soup at Katana-ya. I would definitely go back.   \n\nAs my friend did for me, I would recommend this place to you.", "author": "Marc W."}

Fried Chicken, Gyoza, bbq pork and the usual as toppings, and after all the good things i heard about this place, i was readyyyyy.\n\nBUENO!\n\nTHE RAMEN\nThe noodles itself is just the way I liked it. It was chewy and it didn't get soft in the soup really fast. It was really the best noodle i had from the ramen houses that I've been to. Just this alone I would give katanaya a really high rating.\n\nNo Bueno\n\nThe Soup Base\nI know i ordered the heavy miso, but still, it was on the salty side. It wasn't like a nice rich flavor, but just kind of salty, so i didn't really like that.\n\nThe Egg\nThis was probably the most disappointing. Personally, I just expect all the elite ramen places on yelp to have that egg where its kind of yolky on the inside. Because thats the shit and thats something my dad can't make. But the egg they give here is the regular hard boiled kind that my dad could make : ( \n\nThe barbequed pork\nIt wasn't fatty enough. I guess that makes it like, a little more healthy and stuff, but then it also makes it kinda dry.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong even though there were 3 no bueno things and only one BUENO thing, katanaya was still goood. I just thought it'll be better. I think it was the toppings a chose (fried chicken, gyoza) and that hard-boiled egg and dry pork thing. Somehow, i feel like that rough texture toppings combination doesn't fit into my mental scheme of how a bowl of ramen should be. I'm definitely coming back still, but im gonna get different toppings and order a light miso soup and hope that my mind will be blown away then : )", "author": "Ringo M."}

This place is definitely a hole in the wall, and extremely crowded.\n\nPut my name on the waiting list and waited only 5 minutes.  There was a guy waiting in front of us, with his name on the waiting list, but his whole party was not there yet.  Sucks for him, because the waiter would not seat him.  So he started to swear at the waiter, and then stormed out like an angry jackass. Swooped his spot and was instantly seated :) . Worked out well because the people in line after us got seated when we were almost done eating. haha\n\nAnyways, the tables are quite small and can barely support holding 2 bowls of ramen, an appetizer, and 2 waters.  The sushi menu does not look like it is ever looked at (or maybe should not be looked at).  I ordered the fried chicken ramen with miso soup.  GF ordered the butter corn ramen with miso soup.

This ramen wasn't bad but it wasn't the best I've had either.\n\nThis place is located right smack in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of downtown SF which makes it an easy target for being ultra busy and crowded. I showed up on a Thursday night around dinner time (7pm-ish) and the waitlist was soooo long! Anyway, I heard and read many good things about this place so I decided to wait it out despite my killer hunger -- I usually don't like to starve myself like that. After waiting for about an hour and fifteen minutes we finally were granted entrance. \n\nA huge downfall about the place is that it is really tiny. The table space is almost like a classroom desk being shared by 4 people and there's hardly any room to move around. We weren't fortunate enough to get a table (but I guess that's alright considering the tables are ultra small) but instead, we were seated at the bar (probably better with a little more space to move/breathe).\n\nI ordered the deep fried chicken with spicy miso broth. It was alright tasting but I didn't like that I only got 3 or 4 pieces of chicken and i've had better tasting spicy miso broth elsewhere. Also, the noodles were sticky... kinda weird. \n\nThe decor is also super cheesy. The outside part of the bathroom door has a huge crazy looking owl painted on it and it only gets weirder on the inside... it was weird to try to pee with 4 owls surrounding you on each wall starring straight at you... kind of a trip but I guess that's the most exciting thing about the place.\n\nIt was worth a try but I don't know if i'd wait in line at this place again.", "author": "Melissa B."}

I didn't quite get the feeling that this broth is this family secret passed down from generation to generation and stirred for hours in a large pot that could fit me and a few other people.

Our other plate was the curry dish. which i actually really liked, id come back for that. But when my ramen finally came out, it looked so over done.

There is a clipboard and you write your name down sitting next to the front door.\n\nI had the BBQ pork ramen.  I ordered my ramen extra spicy because I read that it wouldn't be that spicy and that was the truth.  If you love a little kick go ahead and get it extra spicy--you can handle it here.  This ramen is probably some of the best ramen I have had.  I can see how they built their business on this.\n\nThe other thing I liked about Katana-Ya is that they have a sushi bar with great tasting sushi.  My friend had salmon sashimi and they gave her extra pieces.

I finally decided to give in to the hype and try this place out! I dragged my family and we ended up waiting about 45 minutes. Was it worth it? I didn't think so.\n\nMy family and I ended up sharing everything (family-style!). There was the katana-ya ramen (pretty much everything is in this one: fried chicken, corn, fried potstickers, char siu) and two combos! Combo #1 was cilantro ramen with a bowl of rice and unagi; combo #2 was the plain buckwheat noodles with kimchee fried rice! Plus we got a sashimi roll.\nThe katana-ya ramen was yummy and the broth had a good flavor, but honestly, it didn't seem above and beyond other ramen places I've tried in San Francisco. The combos are great because you can get a little sampling of their ramen, plus another dish you know you'll like ie unagi. The price is right too! Again though, not amazing stuff. \nDo NOT get sushi here. Katana-ya is definitely for ramen! Our sashimi roll had mushy rice and my dad was saying that they didn't add vinegar.\n\nKatana-ya is small, which is probably one of the reasons there's such a long wait.

Our group of three had to wait about twenty minutes, and this was after the peak lunch hour. There was still a line by the time I left too.\n\nI sat along the aisle where waiters were constantly walking. Given the tiny amount of room, they're bound to bump into things once in a while. In this particular visit, the waiter happened to spill an entire glass of water on me. He apologized to me several times and brought us a free sashimi appetizer.\n\nAfter the incident, we began ordering. Their menu is pretty interesting - you can customize your ramen and what you put into it. The diagram and the way they laid out their menu was a bit confusing though, so I do think they could try to simplify its layout instead of trying to make it look all creative. But anyway, the customization thing allowed each of us to order different things so we could all try different foods without having to order them separately.\n\nAfter we had ordered, the waiter came back and said that my meal would be free since he had spilled water on me. But he also added that my friends at my table that they would not be receiving meals on the house. He sounded kinda serious when he said it. It's not like those two were expecting it to be free since nothing happened to them, and we had already received free sashimi so we were fine as is, so the reminder and its tone kinda undid his repairs a bit.\n\nOverall the ramen was not anything spectacular, but would be a solid choice if you didn't have to wait for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-09", "description": "Best Ramen place in San Francisco?  \nMaybe, but comparing Ramen shops in SF is like 'chestnuts competing to see who is taller'.  If I use the measurement stick in Tokyo, ALL SF Ramen shops are below average.  However, I cannot fly to Tokyo every time I crave for some shoyu ramen, so I look for the best available compromise.  This is where Katana-ya becomes handy.  \n\nLet's make one thing clear --- many of ramen shops in South Bay are better.  Santa Ramen, Tokushima Ramen, and Maruichi to name a few.  (See my Ramen Ranking: http://www.yelp.com/list_details?userid=H7I6AKkYu-1jemA5cEVu4w&list_id=LGYfZyguH8zAHz-vDVliFA)\n\nIn the city, due to the weakness of Katana-ya's rivals (like Suzu, Tampopo, and Sapporo-ya), they standout.  For some reason, Katana-ya in 2007 doesn't taste as good as it did in 2006.  Did the chef change?  I am not sure.  I noticed that the chef was a Chinese man who spoke Japanese with an accent.  In Tokyo, that's sometimes a good sign for a good ramen.\n\nNOODLE (men):  This is the biggest strength of their ramen.  Classic type with medium thickness, slightly wavy, and very good texture.  Very nice!\n\nSOUP:  Slightly below average.  You get to choose between rich or light.  I always choose light since it is better for my health by keeping the fat content low.  I was initially worried that it would lack taste, but that wasn't the case at all.    \n\nOrder of my favorite soups at Katanaya:\n1. Shoyu\n2. Miso\n3. Shio \n\nTOPPINGS:  BBQ Pork ramen costs $2.50 more than regular ramen ($6.50), but it was worth it.  Pork (cha-shu) was lean, tasty, and soft.  It came with menma, sea weed (wakame), and green onions.  No egg or bean sprouts was a slight disappointment. \n\nOTHER STUFF:  I tried their Ramen and Donburi (rice bowl) combination special.  It's a great deal at $9-10.  Their tonkatsu-don was pretty good.  Difference between tonkatsu-don and katsu-don is that katsu-don comes with dashi flavor and eggs.  Tonkatsu don was a bed of rice with sliced cabbage and tonkatsu - no eggs.  I also tried their Ten-Don.  Stay away from this!  Bad!  Soy flavor was WAY too strong and lacked sweetness.  I would stay away from tempura at ALL ramen shops.  Go to Udon or Soba places for good tempura.\n\nSUMMARY:  Hey, if Katana-ya is good enough for Ichiro, it's good enough for me.  On my first visit there, I was singing 'Like to Be Like Ichiro', when the waitress asked me what I would like to order, I asked what Ichiro had.  She informed me that he likes BBQ Pork Ramen and Chahan (fried rice), so that's what I ordered.  She then asked which choice of soup flavor; soy, miso, or salt; I would like.  \n\n'What did Ichiro have?'\n 'Soy,' she replied.\n 'Then it will be soy.'\n\nSitting right next to the mirror where he signed his name in a blue marker, I was ready to eat the same food as the 'true' MVP of the first ever World Baseball Classics.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

I came here today after getting my brain vacuumed out by a brutal law school exam, and this was oh so soothing and deliiiiiiicious after that traumatic experience!  I got my usual - the deep-fried chicken ramen with light miso sauce.  GOOD STUFF.  But you know what would make it even better? If they add an oh so necessary half an egg, the soft-boiled kind where the yolk is cooked well but still slightly orange and mollety, but not quite so soft that it's runny.  If they add an egg, then it would be PERFECT.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm not complaining.  This is good stuff.  And for a place that always has a wait list outside, it goes by pretty fast.  We came around 1pm on Friday afternoon, and we were seated in about 15 minutes, I think.  Pretty fast!

If you're really craving ramen near Union Sq then it'll do. \n\nAs others have mentioned, you can choose between shoyu, miso or salt broth for each type of ramen they offer. Since the first two types of broth are pretty standard for a ramen joint, I opted to pair their signature Katana-Ya ramen with salt. It might not be a good basis to review this place after not giving the other types of broth a try, but the salt ramen was a bit bland and lacking in flavor. Certainly not the one-two punch in flavor that Santouka's salt ramen does so well.\n\nHaving fried chicken in your ramen to go along with the noodles is a bit different, but a welcome change. Fried wontons were a bit too soggy to really enjoy. The pork slice was also a bit stiff, oops? Noodles are the standard type you can expect, not particularly soft or special in any way. Some people might also be turned off at the pricing for their special since its quite high for a ramen bowl albeit filled to the brim. Eat at Ippudo in NYC first and then complain.\n\nI didn't try the sushi/maki rolls here, guess they cater to everyone's cravings and tastes but I still found that a bit odd.\n\nThis ramen house was perhaps a good ramen joint before all the other shops decided to open up in the bay. As a ramen lover you'll most likely prefer Santa, Ramen Dojo, and Himawari off the peninsula.

It's flavorful, the noodles are perfect and they are quite generous with the chicken.  I got the Katana-Ya Ramen Special with everything in it and it was very tasty.  I asked them to make it extra spicey (they charged an addditional $1.50 for spice) but it did not taste spicey AT ALL, so that was a little upsetting.  I think the bowl came out to be $12 but you will be full.\n\nThe sushi was decent.  I cannot re-call what I ordered but the fish was just okay.  I remember the yellow-tail not being that fresh.  I expected more from their sushi considering fresh fish is available a trolly ride away at fisherman's wharf.\n\nI do eat here everytime I am in SF because of the Ramen but I would hold off on the sushi.  Their alcohol selection is pretty limited and prices were normal.  Its more of an in and out restaurant bc you see the people waiting outside staring you down and mentally cussing you out so you will leave.\n\nI reccommend going with just one other person to reduce your wait time.

Go to Orenchi (in Santa Clara), Maruichi (in Mountain View), or Santa (in San Mateo)...anywhere but here!\n\nCame here for dinner (and another one of his friend since he wanted to come by for drinks) last week when we went to visit our friend's new apartment up in south SF. There wasn't much around the apartment complex, so we decided to go into the city for some grubs. I have to say that in the 2 months I've been in the Bay Area, I've yet to explore the city since part of me just can't stand it!\n\nAfter almost an hour (since we missed the train by just a few seconds), we arrived in the City. The restaurant is located near the Hilton Hotel, where I was last year for a conference...I nearly didn't recognize the streets until I realized that I had eaten at a diner right across the street & the subway/pizza joint right next door before!\n\nThe restaurant is SUPER small like many other ramen places I've been to, and they barely have any space to seat the number of people they can fit inside - a group of 4 sat next to us and the girl next to me was slightly larger than usual, and she was totally in my space! I felt pretty claustrophobic the entire time I was in the restaurant...\n\nI wanted to get the Katana-ya ramen since it has everything and sounded delicious, but my boyfriend talked me out of it because he said the serving is probably too big for me. Then I ended up ordering the combo of the regular ramen (soy sauce broth) with tonkatsu bowl...the ramen was still pretty big for me though, ha ha!\nThe ramen was pretty decent, good flavor/broth, but they don't have an egg (what kind of blasphemy is that?!) in my bowl! The tonkatsu was also one of the better ones I've had in restaurants, so that made my day too.\n\nHowever, I have to say that their service is CRAP! The female servers were all nice, but there is this one guy who annoyed the hell out of me. He nearly kicked us out after having seated us because we were waiting for the last guy to show up for his drinks. Fine, I get that your have a policy where you don't seat people until everyone's arrived, but the way he handled the entire situation was outright wrong and disrespectful. I wanted to just walk out and not eat after the way he treated us.\n\nOverall, I've had WAY better ramen elsewhere AND am treated like a real customer. I would not come back here again until they've re-vamped their staff!", "author": "Cathy W."}

The tables fit 4 or 2 people. \n\nRamen is decent. You have a choice of flavoring: miso, soy or salt. They also tell you that they add MSG, so I asked them to keep it out of my ramen. My noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was hearty and good. AND the portion was pretty dang big. \n\nOnly thing I could really complain about was that they didn't have much flavor options for ramen. they had fried chicken ramen, veggie skinny ramen, bbq ramen and the katanaya ramen, but they didn't have any other flavors like... seafood, curry, etc like ajisen ramen does. \n\nBTW, I eat a LOT but the ramen by itself is enough to fill you, so if you're not sure if you want to spend extra bucks for the combo, it may not be worth it if you can't eat that much.", "author": "Meena N."}

Upon placing my order, the host bluntly told me to wait outside - understandable though unnecessary as the space is quite intimate - and delivered my food after 20 minutes of huffs and glares. The dinner, two different ramen and sushi, was two dimensional: the escalating puckering of mouths from over-salted, third-rate ingredients.\n\nI went back to investigate. Surely the service would be improved - who treats guests as pests? - and perhaps my party chose improperly for our tastes. Different appetizers, different sushi. Like magic, nothing changed!

Agreed!  \n\nAs much as I liked the miso broth, I think the quality of the pork and noodle are equality important components in a great bowl of ramen.  I kept thinking to myself \"if only I could combine this broth with Daikokuya's pork, noodles, and generous amount of green onions, then I would be eating the perfect bowl of ramen\"", "author": "Karen C."}

Came here around 11pm Saturday night and there was no wait time, however finding street parking was almost impossible in this area. Plenty of overpriced garage parking tho, so.... your choice. It's best if you walk here and park several blocks away. \n\nRestaurant is Small, sushi bar is very small. Maximum party is 4, otherwise no space for larger size group. I came here for the Katana-ya Ramen with thick, miso broth. I love the texture and taste of the broth. Definitely 5/5 for broth, just almost perfect in every way,  but you must get the RICH MISO broth! Interesting combination of food they put in your ramen. Fried dumplings, pork, fried chicken, and corn. The assumption is that half soggy fried food will make everything more flavorful. Well guess what?... You're right! it certainly does! Wow that is a hefty meal! It's so filing that in fact, unless you are extremely hungry and usually have a large appetite, I recommend sharing the ramen. Imagine dinner for 2 in the city for less than $10? Wow that is such a romantic, cheap ass (aka. smart consumer), perfect date night. Just don't eat all the green onions. Nothing is more intimate w/o p.d.a. than sharing a bowl of ramen with your significant other. Cuz now that you've shared dinner, you can share dessert, drinks, and so on and so on.... ahem. \n\nAnyway, yes I would definitely come back here as long as it's not busy hour, because jeez I can imagine wait times. The ramen also did not come out fast for us, I'm not sure if it's because they ran out of all the toppings and have to cook a large batch the moment we came. Also the sushi here looks average, as I sat in the sushi bar watching the sushi chefs. Nothing too fancy, but seems pretty fresh and solid in flavor. Probably wouldn't come for sushi but would come back anytime for the Ramen.", "author": "Andrew I."}

Between the two of us, we left feeling full,  satisfied. The Ramen was pleasantly flavored, the noodles were plentiful, and wantons were surprisingly good. The only down side would be the egg (overcooked). I will say that the sushi was average at best. The meal put us at around $15 / person, food only. Pricey, but it is the city. The service was okay: quick and attentive when you were done with food, but not so much with the water. It wasn't terribly busy, either. The waitress gave a recommendation upon request. It did not seem like they were attempting to contribute to the dinning experience, just conveying food and beverage.\n\nI would give a 3.5, if only for the Ramen. The lackluster service and bland sushi took away from the experience. If you come here, come because you want to eat some Ramen. Maybe bring yourself some water if you like to drink a lot when you eat. Also, bring a breath freshener for after, because the Ramen breath is real.", "author": "Tyler H."}

We waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated at this TINY table and I was starting to feel claustrophobic. I don't care about the setting as long as the food is good so I sucked it up. I had pretty high expectations for this place. My boyfriend and I decided to order the Katanaya Ramen with miso base and the regular udon noodles with salmon don.\n\nKatanya Ramen - ehhhh I've had a lot better ramen and considering that this is their signature ramen, it was a big disappointment. The noodles were gross. They were hard and did not taste fresh at all. This is what came with the ramen:\n- Two pieces of fried chicken (don't get that excited, it's like popcorn chicken and the meat is tough), which was soggy because it was soaked in the soup.\n- Two fried pork potstickers, which was cold and also soggy. My mom makes better potstickers. Actually, Ling Ling potstickers are better and THAT says a lot.\n- Two pieces of BBQ pork which had no taste. *Correction: it tasted not fresh.\n- Half of a boiled egg (I gave this to my boyfriend...I think it tasted aite...it's an egg, you can't really mess that up.)\n\nThe udon noodles was the surprise of our meal. It was really delicious and the soup was awesome. I think it was fish base. The salmon don was OK too. The rice was soft and warm though.\n\nI will definitely not be coming back. It's way overpriced for mediocre ramen. Our meal cost over $30 and considering that it wasn't that good and the portions were OK, I would much rather travel a bit farther and go to Saiwaii Ramen (Sunset) or even farther...Shin-Sen-Gumi in SoCal. Katana-Ya even adds MSG in their broth...isn't that supposed to make the ramen taste better?

There were maybe a dozen people waiting outside, but turnover was quick so we were seated after maybe 10 minutes (be sure to sign in on the clipboard out front!). The menu is extensive, but most people come here to customize their own noodle soups; you pick your soup base, noodle type (ramen, udon, soba), soup type (soy, miso, salt), density (rich, regular, light), and spice level. We ordered:\n\n- Katana-ya soup with ramen noodles in soy sauce broth, medium spicy: Totally loaded with goodies! My boyfriend thinks he would've personally preferred miso, but I liked the cleanness of the broth. I would order this again.\n- Spicy beef and tofu soup with ramen noodles: I wish I'd seen more than a simple picture before ordering this. I didn't expect this to be essentially a super thick, traditional Asian beef stew (with carrots, potatoes, and onions). It was much too heavy to be enjoyed as a noodle soup, and was definitely not authentic.\n\nAnd, because it's relevant, our post-dinner impressions should be included. My boyfriend's ramen did not sit well in his stomach (although I was fine), and we both couldn't shake the aftertaste of MSG hours later.\n\nService was very efficient and nice to us -- but I noticed that our waitress was a bit rude and impatient with the table next to us. She came out with food and, instead of declaring herself to the table, simply stood there loudly repeating the names of the dishes until someone noticed.

My favorite places to eat ramen are Maru Ichi (Mountain View) and Orenchi (Santa Clara).\n\nI came with my girlfriend and ordered karaage chicken with the katana-ya ramen regular miso (gotta go full out when trying it without excess msg right?).  The chicken was alright, nothing amazing like what I've had at Honda-Ya in LA before.  The ramen came loaded with 2 pieces of BBQ pork, potstickers, bamboo shoots, fried chicken, half an egg, and some other goodies that I can't recall.\n\nThe broth was good, but not amazing.  This goes to the noodles as well.  Though enjoyable, I wasn't feining to instantly take another bite.  The flavor of the broth was good but not anything interesting or complex tasting.  Noodles had a good consistency that did not become mushy near the bottom of the bowl.  Ours came cooked a little bit more than el dente but still good.  Bamboo shoots were way too salty, BBQ pork was delicious, potstickers were lacking (just overall awkward and not good), fried chicken was of course soggy and could not compare to the karaage even though it's the same thing but was still ok to eat.  The egg was disappointing!  I love it when the yolk is still not fully cooked so it blends with the ramen when I eat it with the broth.  In this case, our egg seemed like it was hard boiled, cut in half, and placed into the ramen.  Boring.\n\nOverall, this place deserves 3.5 stars, a little better than your average ramen shop but not quite bringing anything interesting to the table.  I know I should have been weary when noticing they didn't close from 2-6 pm and opened late, which authentic japanese restaurants often not do.  Maybe next time I'd probably just get the regular ramen or something cause the katana-ya seems more like quantity over quality in regards to the additional ingredients added.  I do like the noodles and broth, I just wish the flavor was a little more complex.  I was left feeling full (remember I just shared only the ramen and karaage chicken with my girlfriend so that says a lot) but slightly let down.

But for Katana-Ya, there's no missing where it is, because there is always a crowd waiting outside of its doors.\n\nI came here in a group of 4 around 7:30 on a Sunday night and we put our name down on the waiting list, with at least 10-15 names ahead of ours.  The hostess told us that it would be about an hour wait, so we took this opportunity to go shopping.  It is only a block from Union Square, so there's plenty to see or do in that one hour.  \n\nWhen we came back, it was only a short 10 minute wait until our table was ready.  The place is really small, with maybe 8 small tables (the tables are actually really tiny) and a sushi bar area.  I ordered the chashu ramen (BBQ pork) with miso broth ($11) and got free tea (and water).  The ramen came out fairly quickly, less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe bowl was a pretty good size.  I was able to finish most of it, but I was completely stuffed at the end.  There are a lot of noodles and about 4 pieces of pork.  The also throw some bamboo shoots and seaweed on top as garnish.  The ramen is really simple, but really good.  It isn't trying to be anything fancy really, but you can taste the quality of the product.\n\nIf you're feeling extra hungry, they do offer combo meals, ranging from $11-$14 (i believe) which include a bowl of ramen in addition to a side such as: california roll, curry over rice, tuna over rice, etc.  \n\nNote: parking can be difficult in the area.  We got lucky and found free street parking about a block away.\n\nThe place is open late, and even when we left, around 9:30, the place was still packed with a crowd still waiting, outside.", "author": "Samantha L."}

They definitely need to move into a bigger place. But it's something you have to come to terms with if you enjoy eating here. \n\nI've only ordered their regular ramen. Some people complain that the soup is too bland or plain, but I beg to differ. Americans love their soup base to be full of crazy flavors. Katana-ya keeps their soup base very simple, the way it's suppose to be. They don't overload it with flavors. I know because I've been to Japan, and the ramen tastes pretty similar. I rarely get ramen like this in the states. Other people say that it's too salty. Every time I've gone, that hasn't been an issue.

Still, our group of 3 put our name down with literally 6 parties ahead of us and proceeded to wait. We were seated only 20 minutes later, so DEFINITELY put your name down and wait it out because it is so worth it.\n\nThe Katanaya Ramen is the best option if you want a taste of everything; it's basically like every other bowl of ramen they have combined into one. There's corn, fried potstickers (which gets really soggy, so it's kind of weird), fried chicken (soggy too), corn, half a hardboiled egg, scallions and other green things, and chasu (melt-in-your-mouth amazing, the only reason why this ramen joint is better than anything else in the city IMO). You get a choice of broths (miso, soy, salt--which ranges from heaviest to lightest) and density (rich or light).

They seated us immediately in this center corner of the room and it would be cramp for some patrons (just a heads up).\n\nWe ordered the following items:\n\n-2 orders of BBQ Pork (Chashu) Ramen.\n-2 orders of Nigiri Sushi (2 pieces of Salmon and 2 pieces of Yellowtail).\n\nWithin the five minutes of sitting down I went to use the bathroom. Came out and got to my seat and out of nowhere my girlfriend tells me, \"They said they cannot make the sushi orders because the sushi chef, is TOO BUSY.\"\n\nNow at this point, I'm really disappointed. Granted I could sympathize with the guy (especially after working in the restaurant industry), I could tell he was in the weeds. However this becomes an issue stemming from one of three points of origin: staffing, logistics and time management. \n\nIn this case it was staffing (lack of an assistant sushi chef) and the lack of training in customer service by said waitress. When I inquired with our immediate waitress she merely replied, \"Uh he has too many orders and therefore cannot serve you sushi.\"\n\nAs she walked away, I looked around and practically 90% of the patrons had some sushi rolls (and plates) available and served to them and yet they couldn't serve to us?\n\nThen things got really dicey, after a 10 minute commotion between the waitress and the Sushi Chef in Japanese she rolled her eyes towards me and said, \"Would you still like to have your sushi orders... he'll make yours first. Yes or no?\" (Later we found out that the Sushi Chef complained to the staff that he was running low on rice and therefore, couldn't make orders as promptly as he normally does. If the waitress paid attention or actually inquired about this firsthand before stating something as ignorant as \"too busy\" I would have been more content with waiting even if it was towards the end of the meal).\n\nAt this rate, I'm pretty irritated but I said yes, just to see whether or not it was worth it. The hassle of getting four nigiri pieces, left a bitter taste in my mouth (the sushi was fresh but the overall experience began to sour).\n\nOur ramen arrived within, five minutes after ward. The miso broth was probably the best thing of the dish (good and hearty but wasn't clean and robust like other places I've tried; Daikokuya, Shin Sen Gumi, Santouka etc. in SoCal. The noodles needed to be a bit more al-dente (lacked a bite of) and somewhat thinner (not braces friendly) and the pork cuts were similar to SSG, but not as marbleized as Daikokuya's Black Pork.\n\nWhen we asked for the check and the waitress asked if there was anything else we needed, before I can even reply \"no thank you\" she immediately turned her back and rushed the receipt to our table and walked off. WTF? \n\nSo as a recap, we spent $36.00 (with poor tip due to bad service) just to get shafted on a half assed experience with subpar food? This is exactly why my \"overpriced\" experience at Senior Sisig was better off, than this Japanese crack in the hole.\n\nMy original rating for this place was 3-3.5 (maybe 4) if the food was just as good as my favorite Southern California ramen spots. However since this place was full of crap...\n\n1.5 in reality, I'm giving a 2 out of pity from having experience in the restaurant industry.\n\nNo thank you, I won't be coming back.", "author": "Ryan M."}

I do have to agree that it is overrated with inflated-praise by 7x7. This place is authentic but Genki Ramen (inner richmond district) does a better job at execution, flavor, value, and presentation.\n\nI went with a friend at 5pm yesterday and there were many vacant tables. I felt a bit rushed as the waiter kept asking if we were ready and peered at us from the cashier counter. There are a lot of options on the menu and I had a hard time deciding between just ramen or the combinations. I eat a lot so I was definitely looking at the combos more but for $14, I could get 2 full boxes of kimchi fried rice. I have to watch my weight too so I didn't go for any meats in my ramen. Ended up with spicy green onion ramen with lite density miso soup. Lite density soup has less fat.\n\nThe wait was a little less than 10 minutes. I took one look and I was a bit sad that I didn't order meat. It was just too simple for $9.80 worth of a meal. The \"spicy\" is just a spoonful of Chinese chili sauce found at Asian restaurants (NOT Sriracha). The miso broth was alright but I've had better. It's probably not standard in Japan but I wanted corn in my ramen. I didn't take too long to finish it either. I wanted to order sushi but I felt the need to conserve my money for better things.

The karaage chicken and gyoza in the ramen is a winner for me - also something unique that other ramen places don't have. The broth itself is not bad, but not great. They do give you a pretty hefty portion of food so be forewarned. I can never finish a whole bowl of their ramen. \n\nSushi was.. mediocre.

It's located a few blocks up from the Powell Bart station on Geary & Mason, near Ruby Skye and the American Conservatory Theater.\n\n*When? We went for lunch, of course. They open right at 11:30AM and I hear it gets pretty crowded. The crowd usually results positively in most cases. However, in this case I think it was crowded because the spot is so small & cramped.\n\n*Well? Worth the lunch rush from FIDI to Union Square? No. I absolutely LOVE soup, all kinds of soup even. However, the chasu ramen was satisfactory. The chasu (bbq pork) was tender, but didn't differentiate from any other pork out there. The miso flavor was a little too salty for my taste. There weren't very many vegetables which I LOVE, only a bit of spinach from what I remember. \n\nRecommended by a fellow Yelper, the Agedashi Tofu ($6) appetizer was a hit. It was really, really good. Honestly, although it's my favorite it's ALWAYS served good anywhere you go. So, no points earned for that dish. \n\nBottom line: If you're in the area, sure give this spot a try.

(Well, for me anyway. I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't use umbrellas just for rain :P) On a recent trip there, I enjoyed some of the best ramen outside of Japan (4 times in 4 days!) I've been jonesing for a little taste of Hawaii in the form of expensive ramen since being back in SF and this craving brought me to Katana-Ya.\n\nIf it wasn't for 7x7, I don't think Katana-Ya would be as popular as it is. I came here for a friend date on a Thursday night at 7. With about 14 tables ahead of us, we waited outside for almost an hour. Patience is not one of my virtues, so if I have to wait that long for dinner, it'd better be worth it.\n\nThough known for their ramen (again, all thanks to 7x7), they also serve a variety of appetizers, sushi, sashimi, and donburi. We ordered a uni ikura don, a small kimchee fried rice, and a katanaya ramen to share.\n\nThe UNI IKURA DON (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/F3bL-3Btko-JSupCC2pPAw?select=D6sYiq8_tLxiFoE422YZPQ) was incredible! The ingredients were so fresh. Mixed together, the dish was definitely greater than the sum of its parts. The creaminess of the uni, the pop of the ikura, the brininess of both, and the not-too-vinegary rice combined in perfect harmony. All the flavours were balanced with nothing overpowering anything else. I also really liked the KIMCHEE FRIED RICE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/F3bL-3Btko-JSupCC2pPAw?select=1nY3aiDFTjl37rdWneP3Gw) and thought it had great flavours. I just wish it wasn't so greasy. \n\nAs for the ramen, though the noodles were cooked just right and the rich shio broth was delicious, I wasn't that impressed. We got the KATANAYA RAMEN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/F3bL-3Btko-JSupCC2pPAw?select=PHUPE83Ispl2eogm6dcmCA) since it came with a bit of everything (corn, fried chicken, fried potsticker, seaweed, bamboo, bbq pork, and egg). One of the reasons I like fried foods is the crispiness. But, putting fried foods in a bowl of broth only makes them soggy. Though the chicken was juicy and flavourful, I couldn't get over the mushy breading. I also wish they had more soup flavours than just shoyu, salt, and miso. That is to say, I wish they had my favourite tonkotsu broth. I'm a bit of a loyalist when it comes to this creamy pork bone broth!", "author": "Steph L."}

The ramen was good and still had a tiny bit of chew in them (perfect!).  The chicken and gyoza were freshly prepared and arrived hot and crispy.  The broth was good, but I felt it was missing something, as if it was one dimensional.   In addition, I do wish the broth could have been hotter; it was at an adequate temperature, but I prefer the broth for my soup noodles to be HOT, as in almost boiling.  I've had better, but is it fair for me to compare it to the ramen I've had in Tokyo?   \n\nThey have a pretty comprehensive menu of sushi, noodles (ramen, udon, soba) and combo items with ramen and rice bowls (e.g. fish, curry, katsu, etc.).

I thought mine was the right balance of creaminess and flavor.  While the rich density option was still tasty, there is definitely added oil and fat layers to the broth.  The bowls are large (given the hefty $9 - $11 price tag), and filled with thick noodles, bamboo shoots, and juicy slices of bbq pork.  We also ordered a salmon-avocado roll on the side (as part of their regular ramen combination meals).  It tasted fine, although the rice was a bit dry.

It's just what I learned to eat growing up.  \n\nAfter getting my hair done and walking around Union Square, I decided I needed to refuel.  I've heard great reviews, so naturally I had to try for myself.  I must say, I'm not totally blown away, but I'm not hating on the place either.  Lucky, there was no line and I was able to get a seat at the bar.  Not the most comfortable and the lighting in there is like a bad night club just before all the lights come on.  I sat as I watched the \"sushi chef\" prepare the rolls while he jams to his tunes in his headphones.  It's sorta like Bizarro up in that joint.  But whatever, I've seen worse.  \n\nFood-wise, I had the combo Katana-ya ramen with the soy sauce broth.  It pretty much had everything in it.  I couldn't decide on one, so I wanted it all!  It was tasty, the noodles were fresh and cooked just right.  The texture had a nice bounce to it if you know what I mean.  Everything sorta checked out so no real complaints.  I just wasn't blown away by it.  \n\nThe place is smal and it gets hot especially when you're eating a big ass bowl of ramen so it definitely feels good on a cold day.  \n\nBottom line:  It's worth a try.

The room was half empty when we walked in this Wednesday at 10:30pm [a first, as I've eaten here over the years a handful of times, and it's always packed.]. There's a new menu with what seemed like fewer noodle options. Staff usually greets you when you walk in, but all we were greeted with was one of the waitstaff slumped at the bar texting when we got there. Getting their attention was work, drinks not delivered with the dinner, the water requested arrived super late, never refilled. And they were all sort of milling around--and it was not a busy night.\nAnd the ramen. The reason this place has such high marks over the years is their broth is super rich and delicious. Tonight's was edible, but so-so at best. And they're putting these pre-made rolls or dumplings [or I don't know exactly what they were] in the raman that were just soggy and gross. And now both of us totally have heartburn.\nAfter we left we saw a sign on the window outside says they're no longer accepting Groupons and I thought, oh, ok, this must be new ownership after all. What other business owner just stops honoring Groupons they had sold previously? \nVery disappointing!

Well, given that it is in Union Square and real estate is expensive, it's understandable that the restaurant tries to cram in as many customers in the tiny space as possible. Most of us ordered the ramen, with some variation, and generally enjoyed our food. I personally thought the ramen broth was a bit too salty, and my friend (who has been to the restaurant before) commented that the broth was unusually oily... the waitress was also too busy to offer anything more than the basic services.

Seats maybe 20 people or so; so if you show up during any lunch/dinner peak times, be prepared to wait.  I showed up early for dinner on Saturday, so the wait was maybe five minutes for our party of six.  Because the inside is so small, the entire place feels very intimate.  \n\nI ordered the green onion ramen -it was good.  The ramen was fresh, and not soggy (unlike some other places I've been to).  The food came out pretty quick too.  The broth was good because it was not overly salty, and tasted pretty wholesome. \n\nI wouldn't come all the way down here from the sunset area to just eat there, but if I was in the neighborhood during non peak times, I'd certainly consider it.  \n\nAlso, the prices here are fairly on par with other ramen joints, for the most part.", "author": "Anthony L."}

There's a clipboard that's left outside where you need to sign in and with one person, they can always sneak you in more quickly.\n\nI was seated almost immediately and I ordered the Katana-ya ramen, which included fried chicken in the ramen.  OMG, I know that might sound off or disgusting to some but you have not LIVED until you tried it.  It was insanely bad for your health but was amazingly tasty.  The broth was just ok, not too hearty.   Everything else in the ramen was just ok.  I supposed after having friend chicken bits in your ramen you can't go anywhere but downhill.\n\nThe next night I ordered an unagi bowl for takeaway.

I like a little fried chicken in my ramen but I know a lot of people don't care for it because in a way it's mushy fried stuff in soup.

OMG this place is so freakin good!  We stayed at the Clift & asked the concierge for a recommendation for lunch on a Saturday. I usually ask for the best vegan but randomly changed my mind mid asking & said I need the best Ramen. How lucky was I that Katanaya was right across the street & no line when we went?!  Totally small cool place with a rock star looking chef with his shades on in the dim lit restaurant. Great music too!  I got hot hot spicy vegetarian ramen. Omg soooo good!  Such a pleasure finding vegetarian ramen!  I heard it was a cool late night spot after drinking at the lounge at our hotel but unfortunately after 9 days of Napa wine tasting just couldn't stay up late. Instead enjoyed my hotel room with another - yes another ramen bowl dinner. I barely eat at the same restaurants when i'm home, I like variety so much, let alone on vacation!  I thought maybe eating spicy food at night woke me up but nope it was the earthquake. Pretty exciting day & night thank goodness I left Napa for SF that weekend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-23", "description": "I want to emphatically write this review for Katana-Ya, because IMO it totally does not deserve the hype that it gets (7x7 top 100, I'm looking at you).\n\nPersonal credentials:\n-In SF/Bay Area, I've been to Izakaya Sozai, Genki Ramen, Suzu Noodle House, Hotei, Saiwaii Ramen, Halu Ramen, Maru Ichi.\n-In NY, I've been to Kombi, Ippudo, Setagaya, Naruto, Totto, Momofuku.\n-I also lived in Tokyo for a month and visited Japan ~12 times in my life.\n\nI visited Katana-ya 3 times: 1) Deep fried chicken ramen, 2) Katanaya ramen, 3) BBQ-pork ramen. Each time as a combo with a small sushi-don.\n\nKatana-ya's broth is on the lighter side to ramen broths, which is a plus for some, but it lacks the distinction to make it a savory enough broth to merit repeated visits (Ippudo and Izakaya Sozai are outstanding in this regard). Before you fault me on the fact that Ippudo and Izakaya's best broths are tonkatsu based and the comparison might be unfair, I point to Naruto's Shoyu and Halu's Shoyu as examples of lighter ramen broths that are memorable. Even Suzu's Shoyu, although not outstanding, is tastier compared to Katana-ya.\n\nThe perfect broth is a delicate balance between saltiness and the umami factor - it is salty, but not overwhelming. The umami taste should blossom at the end on the tongue, after the broth is swallowed. \n\nMy assessment of Katana-Ya is that the saltiness is there, but after that it falls flat and doesn't redeem itself. It's a decent broth with ramen, but does not \"go places\" with it. In fact, it is probably only a few steps better than broth that comes with instant noodles (which generally all salt + MSG).\n\nI've tried Katana-Ya's rich broth, expecting more of the umami flavor, but all I got was more saltiness.\n\nThe BBQ pork is unremarkable, and the noodles are alright - I generally don't feel like the texture of the noodle should be faulted because this is a personal pref and can be changed on request. They do have pretty good fried chicken, however.\n\nSurprisingly, their sushi bowls (salmon don esp.) are super! The rice is a perfect balance of sour/sweetness, and the fish is extremely fresh.\n\nI feel really silly for saying this, but if you must come to Katana-Ya, I recommend skipping the ramen and getting the sushi instead. In my 3 visits there the sushi has consistently been the highlight.", "author": "Chris S."}

Ramen soup base selection is missing my favourite Tonkotsu \u8c5a\u9aa8, and the sides of the ramen doesn't come with Menma ( preserved bamboo shoot) and those are must haves for me. I was quite disappointed when reading the menu.  Port Katsu-don is about the same, very plain taste and didn't even finish the dish.

The uni was fresh enough that I didn't taste any bitterness and along with the oily ikura and wasabi sting, it was aspirationally tasty. \n\nThe rice really really x 3 hurt the bowl though. Not only was there not much of it (how much is rice, doods?), the rice was undercooked to the point of oddly crunchy. Way to ruin the otherwise awesome uni plus ikura mating dance! Gari was folded into a cute little flowery thing, but whatever, into the stomach that went. The udon was definitely very forgettable. For the $16 you're paying, you'd expect at least a little fishcake slice or something. Instead you're giving a packet of udon in miso broth, with a little bit of green onion and some tempura bits. I hunger for more than that.\n\nI couldn't help but compare to Maru Ichi in the South Bay, and honestly, this place was lackin'.", "author": "Kevin L."}

The ramen here was very below average. The only thing I liked about it was the ramen noodle texture, which was chewy and not overcooked. As for all the reasons why I disliked the ramen: The BBQ pork was almost right, but did not quite have enough of that melt-in-my-mouth quality, the broth was far too salty, and the egg was just a regular hard boiled egg instead of the Japanese style egg with the soft, squishy yolk that I love. \n\nI also tried some sashimi, which was okay, but nothing to write home about. It did not taste fresh to me since there was a hint of a slightly fishy flavor. \n\nIn short, the food is edible and not TERRIBLE, but definitely way below expectations.

I got the salt Katana-Ya Ramen, that has gyoza, chicken karaage, bamboo shoots, half an egg, chashu, seaweed, and corn.  The toppings were okay, but too bad the noodles were overcooked and soggy.  The broth was clear, not exactly the most flavorful.  The salmon don was a bit better, but the temperature of the fish was a tad higher than usual sushi temperature.  \n\nWe sat at the sushi bar, too bad we couldn't chat it up with the sushi chefs because we can't speak Japanese.  I think the 2 ppl who sat next to us got a free raw fish salad...I remember some sushi restaurants do that when you frequent them and they recognize you.

Nothing special aside from the fact that they put so much stuff in that bowl! (Seriously). Pork, fried chicken, gyoza, corn, egg... basically filled! So its great if you are hungry. However.... I felt the quality was lacking. The pork was kind of tough and the chicken didn't fit in with the ramen. While it was just average to me, I was disappointed and probably will not order it again. Granted, I may be a bit picky when it comes to ramen (its one of my favorite Japanese dishes), so I have high expectations.\n\nWe also ordered a dragon roll sushi dish. This again, was just ok.

I love noodles. I grew up eating noodles, and love every single kind - pho, ramen, egg noodles, Chinese knife cut noodles - anything! After trying a couple of places near where I lived in the Nob Hill, I settled on Katana-Ya, as it had the most flavorful and rich broth, with nice chewy noodles. I would get the Spicy Tofu Ramen every time, and share the Albacore Tataki with my boyfriend as a light appetizer.\n\nHowever, I realized that as I came here more and more, it seemed like the portions would get smaller and smaller. They would skimp me on the noodles, fill up the bowl with less broth, and what was the most ridiculous was that the prices on the menu kept going up! Then, I noticed on the menu in small fine print that you could request for no MSG in your ramen. What? - Their ramen is filled with MSG? No wonder it was so addicting (and every single time I left, I would be dying of thirst and my tongue would have a weird feeling to it for the rest of the night). \n\nSo I finally asked for my order without MSG. And low and behold, my ramen was ruined forever - the broth tasted watered down and flavorless. I've never gone back since. Still searching for a good ramen place in the city.

I think one of the most important parts of ramen is the broth, and yes the broth here was tasty, but I think it was more of an MSG and oily tasty than that rich and deep flavor that GOOD ramen should have. I ordered the deep fried chicken ramen in miso soup, and I think it's cool how you can choose from either miso, soy sauce, or salt based soup regardless of which ramen you get. You can also make any ramen extra spicy with an additional $1.40, which is cool too. The deep fried chicken was average, nothing special, but I did like the texture of the noodles. I don't know why ramen is always so expensive, and the ramen here is around $11-13 per bowl. I didn't think it was worth it, considering you really do get what you order: deep fried chicken, ramen, oily broth, and maybe a few pieces of bamboo\n\nEnvironment/Service: This place is definitely in a good location, I would totally come here before going to Ruby Skye or something.

The four star versus five stars is mostly due to the lack of consistency in service, including one very bad experience over a year ago, but this last visit the waitress was pleasant and quick to place our order. My friend and I had to wait outside in line for a table as always, but the line goes quickly enough. I get the same thing every time, which is the spicy green onion ramen. This bowl of noodles is the closest I've ever come to recreating my all-time favorite ramen experience in Yokohama, Japan, where I studied in college. The broth is spicy but not overbearingly so (you can get extra-spicy by request) and not too thick, although you can thicken it by request as well. The green onions are a perfect contrast to the spicy broth, as they meet its integrity with strong flavor and a crunchy texture. Katana-ya cuts their green onions length wise as well as width wise, so you pick up long strands of onion along with your noodles as well as spoon them into your mouth with the broth. The bowl comes with bamboo shoots and nori. You can add other things such as soy sauce eggs (which normally come with ramen) but its an extra charge. I usually get the egg and extra bamboo but it ends up being $3-$4 more. If you're not as much as a ramen fan as I, they also have sushi and well priced lunch special combinations where you get a smaller bowl of ramen, soba or udon as well as something from the sushi bar or kitchen. And, of course, they sell cold Japanese beer and hot sake.\n\nFor you fellow Japan-o-philes who are familiar with the Japanese ramen scene, the ramen shop in Yokohama I mentioned is Hokkaido Ramen on Isezeki-cho. I've randomly met two people in the US who have also said this is the best ramen they've ever had. In all fairness, this style of ramen originated in Hokkaido which might be why its hard to find elsewhere, as it seems that most restaurants in San Francisco serve Tokyo-style ramen with light soy sauce or salt broths. However, I lived in New York for three years and have tried all kinds of ramen places and not one has come close to recreating that Yokohama experience. For some reason, spicy ramen is almost always miso based in the New York ramen joints which is not at all the flavor or consistency I crave.

My friends and I got a variety, each with a different broth (they have four), and I tried all of them. They were all very one note and none of the ingredients were special. There just wasn't a lot of thought or care put into flavor. And they barely give you anything other than the noodles. I've had much better and even made better with instant ramen.

Even though I prefer Ajisen Ramen in the Westfield food court, I feel compelled to like this place more just because of everything it represents: small business, divey hole-in-the wall, small gem in the Tenderloin.... \n\nThe ramen is pretty good, though there isn't a whole lot of selection. The price is decent - about $8 for a bowl - but the portions aren't overly large. I can comfortably finish one bowl. I think I've only gone for the regular ramen with miso soup base the last couple times I came. It doesn't come with that much, but you do get a few slices of pork and some straggler vegetables thrown in. I can't say that it's the best I ever had, but it's pretty good.\n\nI also got to try the lunch special with a salmon avocado roll, and I think that's definitely worth it. The roll is pretty big and you get big chunks of salmon. \n\nI like the atmosphere of the place. It's nice and cozy and the service is warm and prompt. I've only come here with a party of 2, and both times - dinner on a Sunday night and lunch on Friday - we didn't have too wait long. \n\nVerdict: I'll definitely come back!", "author": "Jamie C."}

Or how crappy their broths are? Or the quality of their char siu? And their skyhigh prices? Look around the restaurant and spot the Japanese tourist from the ignorant locals. See that? That's the look of disgust. That's the feeling of being ripped off after spending 12 bucks on a bowl of shitty ramen. That's pain when the Japanese tourist realizes they are eating the most god awful ramen in their entire life, and is wondering why they took a chance to eat a ramen place outside of Japan. \n\nCall me a ramen snob all you want, but once you eat ramen in Tokyo, you'll never, ever accept mediocrity for awesomeness.

That said, there aren't very many ramen shops in SF to begin with or compare to.  If this was in the South Bay, I'm not sure that it would be that crowded or highly rated.  People flock to this place because it is one of the few ramen shops in SF and it's centrally located downtown.   I have to caveat this review by saying that I am Japanese and might have a higher standard for ramen than the average person.  The ramen broth is OK--it's good, but definitely not the tastiest I've had.  The noodles are not freshly made, but still soft and chewy enough.  The fish is relatively fresh, given the high turnover.  But then again, it's very Americanized sushi rolls, etc. (e.g., lots of siracha sauce).  Overall, its a decent bowl of ramen with a good portion for the price, given the limited ramen places you can find in SF.", "author": "Miyuki I."}

It came in a giant black bowl with tons of spicy broth. There wasn't much pork- just a little on the bottom- but it didn't really matter because it was super delicious regardless. Just the right amount of spicy, lots of noodles and tofu.

Safe to say it should be a match in heaven, right? WRONG. The first time I went I got the green onion ramen which was very bland, and the texture of the noodles was off. I left the place happy I tried it, but convinced I'd never return.\n\nThe 2012 Big Eat list came out earlier this year, and without fail, there it was again, lingering, like that one person who doesn't know when to leave the party. But then I started to question myself. 'Maybe I should give it another chance. Maybe I just ordered the wrong ramen.' Fast-forward a couple of months, and after a night of drinking in the area, surprise, I was hungry. And I craved ramen. So my cousin and I walked over to Katana-ya, grabbed a seat right before it closed (it closes late, that's a plus) and ordered a bowl of their chasu ramen. REDEMPTION!!\n\nIf only. Still bland, still the same. No amount of pepper or soy sauce could make it better, though it did make it more unhealthy. I kept asking my cousin if he felt the same way, and he agreed. Underwhelmed again. People say the katanaya bowl is pretty good, but I'm guessing it's because they throw the kitchen sink into it (fried chicken, potstickers, pork, egg). If good ramen is defined by how many fried pieces of food you can fit in the bowl, I'll gladly pass.\n\nNo hard feelings Katana-Ya. Alot of people seem to love you, so you'll keep getting good service. I'm just not a fan. You provided quick and easy service both times I went, and it's great you're open late. I'll keep going Ramen Dojo in San Mateo, and you can keep fighting the good fight. Everyone wins.", "author": "Stan A."}

That may have had something to do with the fact that it was well after midnight when my girlfriend and I stopped by, or because we'd had a few late-night libations, or because we'd been flying all day and were still famished, but I'm pretty sure that none of those factors made a difference.  When our food arrived, it was incredible.  The noodles were firm, but not under-cooked.  The meat was tender and delicious.  But the broth...ohhhhhh the broth.  I could drink gallons of it.  Salty, sweet, filling, comforting, unicorns, glitter, rainbows, pots of gold...amazing stuff.  I'm pretty sure that if you bathed in it daily, you'd live forever.  Mostly because they may not serve it in heaven, making death and the concept of some sort of after-worldly paradise moot.  Try the ramen, any ramen here.  You'll love it.\n\nA word of caution though: the hole-in-the wall descriptions of other reviews are not exaggerations.  It's tiny in there.  Only a handful of tables, most of which are two-tops.

Having come directly from an A.C.T. performance across the street, I was able to experience the food here for the first time with a clear mind and palate.  I've had a lot of good ramen in my day (mainly in Manhattan's East Village) so from that perspective I can't get really excited about this joint's oversized noodles and bland broth.  However, for the Union Square neighborhood and as a late night option, I can definitely see why it is so popular.  With all that in consideration, it is an A-OK (3-star) experience for me.\n\nGyoza: Standard - one side crispy and one side steamed.  The ground pork inside was tender.  Done well for this basic comfort food.\n\nKatana-Ya Ramen (rich salt broth): Basically the \"Kitchen-Sink-Ya\" Ramen.  There was half a hard boiled egg which I expected more from.  If it's going to be half an egg, it should be semi-soft boiled for a gooey center.  If it's going to be a hard boiled egg, it should be sliced thin because the hard boiled yolk center is a tad overwhelming in a complete half egg bite.  The dark meat pork was tad too thin and tough.  The deep fried gyoza was like something from a Chinese take out joint in a bad neighborhood, they totally should have used their appetizer gyozas.  The salt broth, was well, salty.  I had hoped it would enhance the natural meat broth flavor but it did not as the meaty tone was still mild.  I'll get into the bits of fried chicken when discussing the next ramen...\n\nFried Chicken Ramen (rich soy broth): The good chicken karaage I've had in the past contained small, juicy morsels of dark meat chicken in a thin and crispy fried batter.  This karaage was oversized, overbreaded and tough instead of juicy tender.  As a by-product, the excess batter falls off into soup... which I'm neutral about though could see folks on either side of the fence on that point.  I appreciate that the soy broth didn't taste like eating pure soy sauce, but like the salt broth, it didn't help bring out the meatiness of the base.", "author": "Adam B."}

Quite hard to get anybody's attention if you needed something. \n\nFor me, I ordered their spider roll and it wasnt too shabby. I'd order again if I had a choice. Nice BIG pieces. Think it was 4 pieces.. \nNow for their noodles, I ordered their KatanaYa ramen at the medium spicy level, the bowl with everything.. the pork, chicken, corn, garlic, etc. The soup was rich enough, not too spicy so I couldve went a level higher in spice. But as you eat on, it seems to become super salty.. so I figured the soup was maybe overloaded in sodium and MSG? Their menu says that their soups have MSG (even the bamboo shoots were crazy salty) Their noodles were very good! taste, texture, the way it soaks up the broth. \n\nAll in all. I thought it was too long of a wait.. and too uncomfortable of a seating just for a bowl of noodles that were a tad too salty. But their location and how late they're open is very convenient.

I ordered the lunch combo, so I also got a bowl of kimchi fried rice which tasted like hash browns and breakfast sausage (how does that happen?).  Despite the unexpected taste, the rice wasn't bad.    \n\nTheir curry was bland and kind of boring, but the service was good and there wasn't much of a wait!  Although, the restaurant is pretty small - I can't imagine it could ever be good for groups.\n\nI'm adding the 5th star, because I JUST REALIZED that this place is open late!

Ramen it is!\n\nI Yelp'd around for the best ramen in town and all of the roads pointed to Katana-Ya. I should read the writing on the wall when other Yelpers wrote 'best ramen in town because there is a limited number of ramen places in SF'. \n\nI decided to get the most basic ramen bowl with a side of spicy tuna-don. Polus T. got the ramen bowl with extra veggies and extra bbq pork. When the food arrived, we both knew we were in for major disappointment.\n\nThe pork was overcooked in comparison to the typical chashu you'd usually get with ramen. We both got the salt based broth and knew right away that it didn't seem right. The broth just didn't look right, and it certainly didn't taste the way it's supposed to.  Maybe they just royally screwed up on our bowls, but it tasted like water with some added artificial flavoring. There was no real richness to the soup that I usually experience when I get the salt base broth at ramen joints.\n\nThe ramen seemed to be consistent with that of SoCal's Daikokuya, a little thicker and slightly al dente. I like mine more like Shinsengumi Hakata, which is still my favorite ramen joint for strictly ramen.\n\nThe other ingredients that came with the ramen were forgettable, as I really did forget what else came with it. I think I was so hungry after the race that I inhaled all my food, but I ate it only because it was there.\n\nThe place is really really small, and as others have said, a party of 4 is already considered 'big'. The servers, while not rude, were really 'short' with us. If we weren't ready in 2~3 seconds after getting their attention, they fluttered off somewhere else and we'd spend a few more minutes getting their attention. Their English was not the best, so pointing at pictures was the next best option.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the Spicy Tuna don that came with my ramen. The Spicy Tuna really was quite spicy and tasted pretty good.\n\nOverall, I don't think I'd ever come back since SF has so many better offerings to show. I've had much better ramen at much more affordable prices. Sorry Katana-Ya, you just weren't worth it.", "author": "Andrew F."}

If you want something inexpensive (for the amount of food you get), overly greasy and filling, come here!\n\nThe wait was about 20 minutes for a Sunday night around 9PM for a group of 3, they sat us at the bar. They definitely deliver in terms of quantity but not quality. I ordered the namesake ramen with miso broth--a tad on the salty side and very oily. The deep fried items (chicken and potsticker) in the bowl were yummy for about 10 seconds before becoming this soggy mess and the noodles were soggy to begin with. The only saving grace was the thin sliced cha siu, it had a good flavor and not too much fat.\n\nWhen the bill came we asked for 3 separate checks instead they brought over one check for us to split. We put down 3 cards and they accepted it at first before returning and rudely slamming down ours cards shouting \"only 2 cards per table for bills under $100.00\". First of all we're not even at a table, nor did you give us the option of waiting for one before you place us there. Secondly, who would spend over $100.00 at a ramen place?

I can say that loudly and proudly.\n\nI've lived in Japan for a long time and my favorite ramen flavor is tonkotsu. The best place to get tonkotsu ramen in Japan is Ichi-ran and Ippudo. Tonkotsu ramen requires a really long time to make. You start the broth with boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for many many hours and if you do it correctly, and only if you do it correctly, you'll get a nice, rich, creamy, cloudy, intense flavored broth at the end. \n\nI've both seen long lines at Katana-ya and read up reviews about how amazing their ramen was before I went to try it out.\nI went on a weekday around 1 pm; the line wasn't bad, my friend and I got in without having to wait. We sat at the bar and memories of Japan rushed back as people around us were conversing in Japanese. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, (I was going to order the tsuke-men but they said they stopped doing that) and I can't remember what my friend got since it wasn't memorable enough.\n\nMaybe it is because I had too much expectations for this place; as soon as I slurped my first spoonful of the broth, I was disappointed. It wasn't creamy and cloudy as I was expecting and it certainly wasn't rich either. It tasted like they got some pre-made tonkotsu broth paste and mixed it with water and served it. So the broth wasn't good, maybe the noodles would be nice and chewy. I was wrong again. The noodles tasted bland. The broth didn't soak into the noodles like it's supposed to. The noodles tasted like they have been frozen for months and costed less than a cent to buy. Even the chashu was gross. And afterwards I felt sick and dizzy. It must from all the MSG they put in. \n\nFrom then on, I just go to Tanpopo; their kara-miso never disappointed me.", "author": "Erica L."}

I really did... but sadly, your sushi just doesn't come up to snuff with your ramen!! \n\nI had the pleasure of coming on a Friday night and was surprised at how PACKED the place was.  The restaurant is tiny and therefore all of the waiting takes place outside.  There are a handful of tables inside as well as a bar area to sit and enjoy the ramen.  After a short wait, we were seated, so don't worry - don't let it discourage you.\n\nThe best ramen ever - at least that's what my husband though.  I opted for the miso based soup with the deep fried chicken ramen.  Sounds weird, but it works.  In retrospect, I should have tried the soy sauce based soup - heard really good things about it.  I think the thing that made the ramen so good was that the soup had so much flavor packed in it! Dang, I'm hungry just thinking about it (and it's about 85 degrees outside).  \n\nAside from the ramen, they also have sushi.  The albacore tataki was great... the rest was ... only okay.  Sadly to say, it wasn't memorable enough for me to really remember everything that we had.  To my recollection we had some variation of an alaskan roll - with the salmon.  \n\nMy recommendation - get the ramen, come early, come often!", "author": "Michelle N."}

The boyfriend isn't a fan of this place because the taste isn't there for him but I think you get a lot of quantity and an overall decent bowl of soup.  I've been there a handful of times and they have some inconsistencies but overall I keep coming back.  The soup comes out hot and brothy, the noodles are OK and all of their meats and sides are given in generous quantities.  \n\nI think my 3 star is because theyre so concerned about getting people in and out that they start to lose the quality of the food.  The broth was a bit too greasy, the seaweed salad while the taste was there, they just threw it onto the plate and had bits of seaweed dripping off the platter and some areas of the salad was more salty than others.  There have been some days where I think theyve done an amazing job and others just OK.

Um, she was very pretty too, but that's unrelated so never mind that, I just had to tell someone, might as well be the internet.\n\nThe sushi wasn't that good, however they did just ask the chef to hurry and slap me together a new roll, so I doubt it was as well put together as it's predecessor.

I'm feel really sad at this point, because I am deeply in love with all the veggies that Ramen provide (except seaweed, yuck. Yes, I am as ashamed of me as you are for not liking it. Heck, I've lived in Japan and still can't stand seaweed, it's beyond disgrace).

Long waits (though not in off-times) due to its small size and popularity. Cozy, tourist-friendly d\u00e9cor. \n\nLong version: the first time I had Katana-ya was actually Thanksgiving weekend and I helped compose a group of five, which is probably larger than the typical group size there. As such, and because its location is so close to Union Square which was packed that and every weekend, the wait time ended up being about an hour, if not slightly more. The servers cleverly addressed this problem of overwhelming popularity by asking those next to be seated to go ahead and choose their selections (menu is posted by the door), with any questions being answered warmly and adequately. Puts a bit of pressure on you, the eater, but it did streamline the experience and process. And you can always order more or modify the order once inside. \n\nThe food is delicious and you have quite a bit of control over the character of your ramen (oil level, spiciness, etc.), though not as much as other ramen places I've been to. The noodles are standardly at a level closer to soft than to hard, which is perfectly fine with me. The broth is unctuous and delightful, and if you order the cilantro ramen you get a ton of it! Great value! And for being a ramen-centric restaurant, the sushi is good and fresh and tasty. Nothing like an order of saba nigiri to go with your noodle-y elixir. \n\nThis is hardly a complaint, but I do wish this restaurant were located in Japantown, or at least closer to the Kabuki hotel and Sundance Theater.", "author": "Jake m."}

They had put in some scallions and some tempura flakes.  I'm really picky and don't like a lot of things in my soup, so the scallions and tempura flakes were just the right amount.  I gobbled up my bowl right away.  I also thought it was reasonably priced - the udon was about $8.50 if I remember correctly.\n\nI also got Ikura sushi (the only sushi I will eat, the salmon roe).  It was priced two pieces for $5.50, which is reasonable, in San Francisco.  The sushi pieces were pretty large, and the eggs were very fresh.

Yup, this place is super small. Perfect place for parties between 2-4, so anything higher than that, you're looking for a longer wait. In my case, there were a total of 5 of us, which lead to a 20 minute wait. On top of that, we weren't even seated together. Well, 3 of us were seated at the counter, while the other 2/the couple sat in a table right behind us. \n\nConsidering the hustle and bustle of this place, service was pretty good here.

We also split a bottle of sake between us, while the 3 of us shared a spicy tuna roll. The sushi was whatever, but the presentation looked interesting with all the extra veggies the sushi was resting on. The soy sauce flavor was delicious, and the portions are generous.

This quickly changed my expectations for what I was about to experience.  The service was great, nothing good or bad to report there.  Now to the ramen...\n\nDefinitely do not come here if your a fan of the pork base, tonkotsu ramen.  I had the Katana-Ya Ramen and was not very impressed.  I had it with the salt base hoping for the possibility of maybe a pork flavored salt base which it wasn't.  I eventually decided that it was decent but not great.  I did not taste like it came out of a instant noodle bag but still was not good enough for me to slurp up every last bit of broth.  The pork was not very tender and the bamboo shoot was too sour for my taste.  \n\nThe Mapo ramen is definitely sub-par, especially when you consider the price point.

It only makes sense to people if you live in the hip city and likes to go clubbing etc. When we were waiting outside, people are smoking, checking each people out as if we are going to clubs, making false assumptions of nationalities and judgmental comments. Definitely a not kind of place for family whatsoever. \nIt seemed like half the people there aren't coming for ramen, more like 'to get lucky'. Japanese waiters were rude, they have no recommendations of anything just kept repeating what they are supposed to say to take orders - \"shio? shoyu? or miso?\" (which one is better, lady?). The waiters not paying attention to customers and talking each other about going to a club later (in Japanese), kept worried about how her hair looks.\n\nAnyhow, the quality of ramen itself was ok for in the US (this place would be out of business in a heartbeat in Tokyo), nothing to write here about. People are drunk anyway so how'd they know if the ramen is good- this place is like a hook-up bar. A guy sitting next to me came alone not ordering ramen, drinking beer just waiting to see if he can go talk to some girls. \nThe space was cramped and the interior looked poor and unorganized, looks weird sitting next to expensive boutiques etc. Service-wise you get a lot more for your visit when you go places in the south bay. \n\nTOO BAD a lot of people think this place is good - are you f'in kidding me??  try some others in the south bay, if you have a car, that is.", "author": "Another R."}

While North Carolina has more ethnic cuisine than you expect, authentic ramen is one of the few things you can't find. So I was really craving for some good ramen.\n\nSo after searching Yelp, I found Katana-Ya. The location was at the edge of the Tenderloin district, but it felt safe. The store is small, and given the crowd, you had to sign a waiting list to get in even at 8 PM on a weekday (hint: if you are dining by yourself you will get in quicker if you take a counter seat).\n\nThe menu is a ramen fan's dream. It has all the major flavors of soy sauce, miso, and butter. I chose the standard chasu soy sauce ramen with a side other of spicy tuna don (a rice bowel topped with spicy tuna).\n\nThe ramen is just as great as any good-to-great ramen-ya in Japan. The noodles are real noodles that are hand made (don't know if they make it on premise) that are boiled al dente (bet you didn't know ramen noodles should be treated like pasta). The soup was authentic, and seemed to have been made with real broth (instead of instant mix).\n\nThe spicy tuna was a mixed bag; the tuna was fresh but it was too spicy for my taste.\n\nAnd the staff was great. While dealing with the crowd seems to slow them down, they were attentive.\n\nIn general, a great find for someone searching for ramen. Perhaps all ramen shops in San Francisco are of this quality, but regardless this will definitely be a stop the next time I come to this city.", "author": "Toshi T."}

I do not feel one bit of guilt. Not at all. \n\nI had the fried chicken ramen, in soy sauce soup. I was worried that the chicken would be very soggy and yuck. It wasn't crispy, but it wasn't the soggy I imagined it to be and it was delicious and pretty easy shove in to my mouth while rapped in tastey noodles that were swimming in tasty salted oily broth. The whole meal left my mouth feeling a little oily. But it tasted so good that I'm not complaining. The chicken was tender and flavorful, the noodles were the perfect consistancy of desired  chewy-ness, and the broth was salty and delicious. \n\nIn the menu it states that they add MSG, Just sayin'. I think I'm good on my MSG fix till 2012. \n\nService is slow to non existant. Waiter popped in once to take our orders and then delivered the food, and then dissappeared.

It was good but I've had better. I can't really say that it's special because I've had better at other places. The first time I came here I shared a katana ya ramen with a friend, and it was good. We probably got the extra dense soup base but I can't really recall. So this review will only based on my experience from last night.\n\nThey do give you a good portion of everything, good amount of seaweed, bamboo shoot, relatively big piece of BBQ pork, and a lot of corn. It isn't cheap (~9-10 dollars) but acceptable for the portion. Soup base is good but again not super special..I can't say I had a memorable experience here...though I remember I seemed to like it a lot better the first time I came.\n\nOne thing that sort of bothered me was that the waitress seem to be in a hurry for us to order our food. They weren't too pushy but it'll be nice if they don't come check on us every 2 minutes when we're still looking at the menu. The bf added an egg to his ramen, that costed 1 dollar...not worth it unless you're really craving for an egg. \n\nNote: Go 30 mins to an hour BEFORE you actually want to eat around dinner time (between 6-9pm).

Surprisingly, there was no line and while the inside was busy, it wasn't that bad that service suffered. We were seated quickly and served promptly.\n\nThat being said, the tables here are *TINY*. There was four of us seated at this tiny little table built for two, I was constantly bumping and banging into my friends and frankly, was moving into the foreplay territory given how much we were touching. The restaurant itself is small and I get wanting to fit as many people in as possible, but yeeowch. This was a bit too cramped for my liking.\n\nPortions are *HUGE*. Cripes, this is good if you have a big appetite. If you're like me, it felt like a really big waste of money and food. I could have done with something half the size and not paid out $15. \n\nThat all being said, the ramen soup was pretty good. We were given the options of what type of noodles and broth we wanted (udon vs ramen and soy sauce vs miso). From what I understand, their vegetable ramen soup can really be made vegan (unlike some other places that have fish in their vegetable broth) so I was happy with that as an option.\n\nI did enjoy what I had for lunch, but it's hard to say if I'd be back. The cramped seating and cost for such a large amount that I can't eat makes this place a little less appealing than the ramen place in the mall food court.

As always, read all my pros and cons before assuming anything with the seemingly low rating. 2+ is recommended in my books. And I give 2 stars for this fine dining experience, although it may literally be just fine and so-so (relatively). But it's ramen! Ramen is edible and mouth watering no matter what. In fact, I had half a Samyang spicy ramen pack as a night snack today.\n\nDecor: 0.25\nThis place uses its space efficiently, with the bar running along the hall, if you will. The entrance is not conspicuous but just there along the street, sandwiched between other fine dining establishments. What can I say? It's in the middle of San Francisco, the industrial analogue of a honeycomb--buildings stacked for efficient spacing.\n\nThe seats were hard. Since I'm not that big of a fatass, it was kinda noticeable, until I started getting distracted by the taste of my ramen (and lively conversations)!\n\nFood: 0.5\nI got the Fried Chicken Ramen with rich miso broth (not sure if I got the right one because 2 other people in my group got the same, with different richness).\n\nI have had better authentic ramen (Mitsuwa on Saratoga, Ryowa House in Mountain View), but I welcomed it after a long morning. Still, the ingredients tasted pretty generic: generic miso broth, generic flat circular pieces of green onion, generic bamboo shoots. I guess if they tasted like other places, that could also mean it did it right? Or at least this place can blend in with ramen places and still get business. The one in Mitsuwa (it's inside a Japanese supermarket) has the best broth, though. I think it's simmered with bone, Korean style.\n\nI prefer my broth to be piping hot, but it was decently warm. The noodles were nice and chewy, and the fried chicken was well done and delicious. Chicken tastes good.\n\nIf you like to add stuff to your meal, this place only has the basic soy sauce, ground red pepper and ground black pepper. BYOFJC: Bring your own fancy Japanese condiment. You know, like the potpourri of red and black and sesame seed and stuff. Or the red chili oil.\n\nThe menu also claims the food has MSG, and still it did not amaze me. But ramen is ramen, and ramen is good.\n\nPrice: 0.25\n$11 LOL\n\nWell, I guess it is San Francisco after all. If I came back, I would still consider what I got. It's only a $2.05 difference between a regular ramen and one with nice additions of fried chicken, boneless ;)\n\nIf you have a party of 5 like we did, you might want to pretend to be strangers for a while because they slap on 18% for parties of 5 or more. My share turned out to be $14.\n\nToday's price/portion ratio: high. I was not even that full after finishing the bowl. But according to my sexist friend, it is because I am a guy. I attribute it to the fact that they were noodles. Nah, it is because I am a guy. Sexism wins.\n\nService: 0.25\nWhy is there an 18% gratuity again? We got our order taken with someone with a thick accent (assuming Japanese), and the Hispanic dude who brought our food had better pronunciation. He (perhaps this specific man) will call your fried chicken ramen karaage, so don't get confused here. That's cool and all, but he couldn't distinguish which bowls had rich broth or not. He's also the one who brought our waters. He basically did all the work! I'd rather have tipped him directly. The waitresses were busy counting cash. Another reason to split up into smaller groups fewer than 5 members.\n\nBonus: 0.75\nBut for some reason I am biased for ramen, which I like in general.

First off, I feel like the broth here is a lot clearer and maybe has more of a vegetable taste? It's not the pork flavor that I'm used to having at Shin Sen Gumi or Santouka. It's DIFFERENT, but a different that I like and welcome.\n\nFried Chicken Ramen - I really liked the chicken. It was fried to perfection and had an awesome taste mixed with the ramen. The chicken came in strips, and definitely didn't get very soggy in the broth. I liked the flavors and the fact that the ramen noodles were a little bit on the thicker side. A good amount of greens in the soup. Weirdly flavorful broth, but not a creamy/cloudy consistency. Pretty good.\n\nBBQ Pork ramen - definitely had the taste of BBQ pork in the ramen. The only big difference between the two bowls were the choice of protein. I think the broth takes on the taste of whatever protein you choose, but other than that, same bowl of ramen.\n\nThey also have sushi, which I haven't tried, but here's to next time?\n\nThe restaurant is very small, and although I've heard of a long wait, I didn't really experience that at Katana-Ya.

Like the majority of the good ramen places in the SF Bay Area and Socal, their noodles are cooked perfectly. The fact that you can combo it up similar to Maru Ichi is also nice (and the price point for the combo is a great value).\n\nI recommend getting the chicken karage or the Katana Ya special bowl with rich broth (any of the 3 pretty much are good). Just note not to expect an ultra rich flavorfest though, as comparable ramen spots have a richer broth without the title of \"rich\" added to it. The karage was nice and crispy before it fully absorbed the flavor of the miso broth, which wasn't overpowering, despite asking for the strong flavor. Fresh green onions, bamboo, and seaweed further added a nice sweetness and texture to the ramen.\n\nWhat causes me to dock a star are the prices (slightly cheaper than New York, but thats because SF rent is expensive, plus they have extended hours), and the fact that I prefer the broth from several other establishments over Katana-Ya. Also, when requested to sit at a table for 3, which there was roo, we were denied the small table and were seated at the bar, which was a bit cramped. Note that there were 2 more tables (a table for 2 and a table for about 6-8) open in addition to the table for 3 we wanted (by the window).\n\nNevertheless you cannot deny that the quality of food is good, and that it is located around a bustling nightlife. The soup also provides for curbing down your hangover. \n\nI guess for me, it really weighs down to convenience: wait till the next morning to grab ramen for a hangover, or kill 2 birds with one stone.", "author": "Marc T."}

I was expecting the Hatori Hanzo of Ramen but instead, I got Maru Ichi.\n\n**Miso flavored Fried Chicken Ramen (~$12)\n\nWhen you think about it, fried chicken and ramen SHOULD be a good combo, yes? I mean heck! I'm not black, but I like me some chicken, nor am I a Japanese man, but I love me some ramen! This should be a match made in heaven! \n\nWRONG!\n\n(Antoine Dodson voice) WELL! OBVIOUSLY the skin of the chicken starts to get soggy once it's been bathing in the broth for awhile! The chicken itself is delicious, but you get 3 pieces of these tiny, popcorn chicken lookin things. It just feels incredibly lazy and they could have put in one or two more pieces.\n\nThe miso broth at Katana-Ya is absolutely embarrassing. No, I mean SERIOUSLY, it's embarrassing. Not only was it lacking in depth and complexity, but it was flat out boring. I actually thought about seasoning my broth with soy sauce and some salt. It was THAT sad.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I ordered the RICH version of the broth (Katana-Ya lets you choose regular broth, light, or rich.) \n\nWhen it comes to noodles, I am the NOODLE KING! Well... not really, but I definitely know a good noodle when I chew one. On a scale from 1 to amazing, these were \"uhhh... mr. chef? I think you need to cook these a little longer.\" \n\nIt was too chewy, and too bland. Generally speaking, if the noodles and broth are in harmony, the noodles will act as a beautiful backpack where globules of flavor and seasoning can ride their way into your belly (or ass, whichever comes first.)\n\nSHAME on you Katana-Ya! I think it is only fair that you kneel down (in traditional Japanese fashion) and cut open your stomach while I chop your head off. \n\nSo to all you people thinking about going to Katana-Ya: \"HIDE JO KEEDS, HIDE JO WIFE, AND HIDE JO MONEY CUZ KATANA-YA AINT THAT GOOD!\"\n\nI give Katana-Ya a very disappointing 3.0 out of 5\n\nP.S. Orenchi Ramen and Santouka (in Santa Clara and San Jose) are 10000 x better.", "author": "Ray M."}

I am greeted by Liu Kang, come on people, that guy that's worked there for years looks just like him, especially the hair. I just feel like hes going to jump on the sushi bar with Johnny Cage and be like \"Tsung, I challenge you!\" In this case maybe a homeless crackhead from the loin who walked inside. Then the song comes on:  MOOOORTAAAAAL KOMBAAAAT!! Tun tun turun tun...\n\nOk enough nerdy talk. I love this place. The first time I ate here was right after a Broadway Musical named Rock of Ages at Curran. My two roommates and I got a table in about 10min. It's a very small restaurant, hole-in-the-wall, and we sat in a small table almost sitting on top of a couple next to us who didn't talk the whole date, how does that happen? You guys need to read dating for dummies. \n\nWe were all dressed up and my lovely roommate drops the soy sauce by accident all over my white/beigeish dress. Just great. Weird thing is no one complemented it before It got stained, everyone was saying my dress was so cool after, because somehow the soy sauce made cool shapes and looked fashionable.  \n\nI say order the Miso soup, butter corn ramen (could use some salt), sake sashimi, golden, unagi, one of the rolls with mango, about $18 per person. We got served at 1:35am and super fast. I will return, but never again in a white dress.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

One thing you should never do is come here with a large group, that's a death wish.  Seating arrangements give you minimal space and if you're like me, you'll find yourself subjected to the curse of being sandwiched between two tables of wailing devil babies.  Expect a crowd and a wait of approximately 20 minutes on weekend nights...had I known about this beforehand, I would've brought a coloring book or something.\n\nHowever, the delicious food compensates for all that.  I've had both the Katana-Ya ramen and the regular ramen.  The regular ramen isn't anything special because for $8.50, you're not getting much.  I'd much rather drop another $4 for the Katana-Ya ramen which contains fried chicken, potstickers, corn, seaweed, BBQ pork, and half an egg.  I was afraid that the fried chicken and potstickers would be too soggy after sitting in the broth but was pleasantly surprised by how crispy and flavorful both were.  I got the miso broth which I found to be cooked into a perfect state of equilibrium; it was neither salty nor dull.  The noodles aren't bad but felt rough which are not always easy on the chewing process.  Overall, Katana-Ya is great and has definitely become one of my hot spots.", "author": "Alex L."}

Around 2PM, the place was packed and we had to sign up on the wait-list. I don't like how small the restaurant is, especially how close the tables are together. But I guess a small size has its benefits, such as the easiness of getting the wait staff's attention. I liked how the menu has a few pictures to go along with the descriptions! And there's more pictures outside the restaurant too -- gives you something to do while waiting to be seated.\n\nThe Golden Roll was delicious! The salmon and mango were very fresh, and the ginger was a perfect compliment. The ramen (in miso broth, rich flavor) was much better than the out-of-bag ramen I make back home. The flavor was just right and the noodles were cooked perfectly, not too hard, not too soft. Broth was a little oily. The pork slice is nice, tender, and has smokey flavors. The salmon don -- basically rice, grilled salmon, and seaweed as garnish -- was very simple and moist. Rice I generally eat is very dry. However, there could have been more salmon. The udon was almost like any other, with the udon noodle, seaweed, tempura crumbs, and broth. It was nothing too special or unique here, but it is better here than at some other Japanese restaurants I've eaten at. We didn't realize the udon wasn't part of our order until a few minutes later, when one of the girls at the table next to us asked the waitress where her udon was. So, the kitchen made her another one, my friend and I kept silent, and Katana-Ya would have received a 5 star from me if they didn't charge us and extra $7.50 for THEIR mistake. Also, on the bill was a service charge of about $5. Good thing my friend asked what \"s/c\" meant, or else we would have been tipping Katana-Ya twice as much! I personally think that the amount of tip should be the customers' decision, not the restaurant's.\n\nI'll be back again, trying different sushi rolls and more ramen!

If i'm lucky, i get to go twice. Double the pleasure baby. I can't leave SF without having myself a nice big bowl of Katana-Ya Ramen with Rich density and make it spicy for an extra $1.50 (or was it a $1.40?)\n\nThe Skinny:\nUsually, when I want ramen, I tend to settle for pho. Why? well when I want ramen, its just me yearning for noodles in soup. And Pho noodles in soup, and cheaper. BUT! For Katana-Ya...its more than just noodles in a soup. It's an EXPERIENCE. The place is small as all hell, probably not bigger than a freakin' dorm room. But despite the long wait time, the tight sitting, and funky neon lights can easily be overlooked by their amazing ramen. They even have some ridiculously good sushi too.\n\nThe Food:\nI won't say i'm a ramen expert, and i will never say i'm a ramen expert. But there's something magical about this ramen. Maybe its the noodle, maybe its the broth, maybe its the different yumyums added into the bowl (omg chasiu is too good), but its freakin' amazing. A year ago I got their Katana-Ya Ramen (spicy plz), and i remember it so very fondly. I recently got the extra spicy ramen, rich density. Holy crap was it rich. The soup was bright red and holy crap was it heavy. It was THICK but man it was so good. Careful though; not for the weak stomach. Heavy handed with the chili oil, but if you're a masochist, then go for it. It hurts so so good. \nTheir sushi is also really top notch too. Their uni was fresh, and the buttery white tuna and halibut had a great texture and flavor. I want to hug their sushi chef. \n\nThe Service:\nThey were really friendly. Big smiles all around. The staff made sure we got the right bowl of ramen, and they came around once or twice to make sure our water was filled. Which was a good thing too. Dam spicy ramen.\n\nKatana-Ya has amazing food and great service. Quirky decor, but you'll be face down in a bowl of ramen to even notice. OH! and its even open til 2AM.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-16", "description": "Otaku has often been used to describe obsessive collectors but in the case of the ramen world, this term applies to the cult following of this famous Japanese noodle dish. Through out the years, ramen diners have infiltrated the entire globe. Ramen can be considered the popular choice for comfort food. Popular websites such as Ramenworld.com and Rameniac.com have formed communities. While most Americans associate ramen as the square package block of noodles for budget eats, authentic ramen involve master chefs that demonstrate this craft with delicate skills.\n\nKatana-Ya, located in the trendy Nob Hill district, has created a cult following in the thirty seat restaurant. Chef owner Yoshiaki Noto has duplicated an authentic ramen environment resembling the ramen houses I have been to in Japan . Forty years ago in Japan , the master ramen chef started learning the craft from working at a ramen restaurant owned by his relatives.\n\n Although he only had one day of formal training from his relatives, he studied hard by making twenty different ramen bowls a day in order to create his own ramen recipes. Twenty years ago, he immigrated to the United States and started his own business. Although being an entrepreneur included long hours and stress, Noto desired to reach the American dream. Noto admits that his biggest challenge is finding a prime location.\n\nBeing featured in various newspapers and magazines has increased his business. Opening till 2am, Katana has been a top choice for clubbers and other late night goers. The minute I step foot into the cult tavern, the ambiance is colorful. White Christmas lights hang over the sushi bar, small painting decorate the red walls, and mirrors surround the eatery.\n\nWithout hesitation, I order a range of ramen to taste. For those who enjoy a heavy full bodied broth, the miso will deliver. At the other end of the palate spectrum, the salt broth is light. Salt flavor resembles chicken broth (although our ramen broths contain chicken and pork) and miso (fermented soybean paste) flavor taste similar to miso soup but richer.\n\nI start off with an order of the regular ramen ($7.50) in miso broth. Bamboo shoots provide a chewy crunch while tender pork slices enhance the flavor in the pork ramen in miso broth. Although I would have preferred the noodles more on the al dente side, the texture of the noodle was good. \n\nFor an instant rush of heat, the spicy tofu ramen ($9) marries spicy flavor with a minor note of sweet after taste. My favorite ramen dish is the fried chicken nugget (karage) ramen ($9.80) in salty broth. Coated with a thin layer of batter, four chicken pieces were tender. Next time, I would request that the nuggets be served out of the broth so that I taste a crispy skin.\n\nA great side dish is the yellowtail (hamachi) neck( $5.50). Served on the side of a green salad, chopped chunks of hamachi neck are fried in a light batter. Biting through a crispy crust, the meat with the texture of marshmallow greets the palate. A slight dunk into the soy sauce provides the needed savory boost. A dish that can be featured on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern , the shiro kara (raw squid in a brown paste-$6) would take the gold trophy. Although the waitress advised it be consumed with alcohol, I don't think it would have washed off the lingering taste from salt and malted rice. With a slimy consistency, the dish is truly an acquired taste.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

If there's no room, you sign up on a little clipboard with your name and table, and they'll call you as soon as it's ready.  Since there's no waiting area, you will easily see when people are getting ready to go. \n\nIt was raining that day, which was slightly less-than-pleasant, and a definite fault of this system - if you wait, you wait right outside.  This means that whether it's 5 or 50 minutes, you'll be standing outside the restaurant, since I think they only give you about 30 seconds to show up after being called before moving on.  I saw at least 3 groups get skipped while I was eating inside.\n\nInside, the restaurant is jammed to the fullest with tables.  Clearance between tables is thin - expect to bump elbows a couple of times - and my chair back was right on the table behind me.\n\nThe waitstaff was efficient and quick, and they were ready to go as soon as we were.  Probably wasn't helped when the line was starting to travel down the street.  However, they didn't get a single order wrong as I saw, and knew exactly what we wanted starting from the first word, which makes ordering in a noisy, crowded restaurant much more enjoyable.\n\nAs for the food. Easily some of the best Japanese ramen I've had outside of Japan - just chewy enough, well made soup base, and a whole ton of it to boot.  We had the Spicy Tofu Ramen and the Extra Spicy Ramen, which both lived up to our versions of \"spicy\".  We managed to finish both giant bowls of soup, which was pretty much amazing in itself.\n\nPrice was very low - similar to authentic prices, which I think is really a bonus for this place.  The food amount and quality is high, and you just get away with a good deal if you're in the mood for japanese-style ramen.", "author": "Justin L."}

The waitresses are a little impatient/passive aggressive - when we couldn't decide on what to order, the waitress said, \"You know you can ask me questions.\" ::shrug::\n\nIn any case, I decided on the miso ramen. The soup base was a little too salty for me. I really like salty foods, so if I say something is salty, it is salty! The noodles were a little on the hard side, compared to the chewier/softer ramen bowls I have had back east. I was also a little disappointed in the amount of toppings - 2 bamboo pieces, 1 piece of seaweed, and 2 pieces of pork. However, the pork was very tender and not too salty. \n\nI was told that this ramen place is a little more expensive than average for San Francisco by a friend who lives here.

However, since embarking on Ramen Hunt 2007, I am forced to reflect back on my assessment of Katana-ya. Although I do believe it still deserves 5 stars, I am compelled to note a few things since my first glowing review:\n\n-I have tried all the broths (soy, salt, and miso), with my favorite being the soy (shoyu) light style over the rich (so rich I could not bring myself to finish those last slurps).\n-The oil slick atop the broth is rare among other broths I have tried, although Katana-ya does not have as much of the floating pork shoulder fat bits. \n- I love the noodles here; among the best I have had.\n- The chicken katsu is too salty, especially in combination with the very flavorful ramen broth. Stick with chasu roasted pork, order an extra for your proper dose of protein.\n- I am SOOO happy that quality ramen is accessible to me in the San Francisco city proper.\n\nNoodles: 5 stars\nBroth: 4.5 stars\nPork/Meat: 4 stars (it has been inconsistent, but overall great)\nRamen Accessories: 4 stars\nNon-Food Factors (price, service, wait, menu, etc): 4.5 stars\nOVERALL: 4.5 stars\n----------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nToday's lesson learned: it pays to do your Yelp homework (even better with some supplementary research on Chowhound, sorry Yelp). Thanks to some trusted Yelpers' reviews, I didn't even have to look at the menu to order the light shoyu (soy) broth with BBQ pork (though I passed on the extra serving for $2 more...which I might have to reconsider next time). I also picked up a tip from Chowhound to order the noodles cooked \"hard\" so you don't end up with tragically mushy noodles by the last slurp. Hey, now it can be a Yelp tip! (Forgive me now?). \n\nBeautiful ripples of yellow ramen noodles with just enough bite, thin slices of richly flavored marinated BBQ pork, seaweed sheets, green onions, and bamboo (or maybe it's bamboo flowers?) come alive, yet harmoniously coexist with the deep soy broth backdrop. I found the flavor and oiliness of the \"light\" broth  (as opposed to the \"rich\" choice) to be well balanced. Don't be afraid of the oily sheen that skims the surface a few millimeters deep. Among the strongest of the mixed messages I received about food as a kid is that fatty, porky oiliness = delicious. My fellow noodle slurper ordered the miso-tofu ramen, but I can't speak to how that was. Let's just say that next time it will be two orders of shoyu roasted pork ramen. We also split an order of the handmade gyoza, which seemed to have quite a fresh wrapper and filling, though somewhat forgettable.\n\nI feel the need to disclose that I am no ramen-foodie. Before Katana-Ya, my ramen experience was limited to the crappy ramen shop in the Porter Exchange in Cambridge, MA and my favorite 6/$1 Maruchan Chicken Flavor (totally kicks Top Ramen's ass, by the way). BUT I do know crazy delicious when I taste it. It's probably a good thing that Katana-ya is so far from my home, because I can see myself craving a bowl of this ramen at least once a week. Soondubu may have found it's match.", "author": "Steph P."}

Total noms. \nI've been to this restaurant numerous times, and I always bring my out-of-town visitors here to experience the best non-traditional food San Francisco has to offer. The place is a teeny hole-in-the-wall restaurant with room for maybe 20 people who really like each other. If you go during peak hours there's always a line. No reservations as far as I know. \nI've had a bunch of different kinds of ramen soup at Katana-Ya, and all have been wonderful. I'm personally a big fan of the soy-based and miso-based stocks. The house ramen has fried chicken in it and it's excellent. I've also had the pork ramen and it was also swell. The last time I was there I got some octopus ball appetizers and they were really good too. However, they were hardly necessary, given the extremely large portion-size of the soup.

Katana-ya is TINY.  It's a narrow strip of a restaurant with a few tables.  Luckily I went alone on a Sunday early evening, so I could waltz in and eat at the sushi bar.\n\nI ordered their regular ramen noodle for $8.95 or so.  It was not the cheapest ramen ever, for sure.  The service was good - I wanted tea and it was placed in front of me within minutes.  The ramen certainly didn't disappoint.  The soup was pipping hot.  Nothing turns me off more than luke-warm soup.  It had plenty of seaweed, a generous cut of roast pork, good amount of bamboo shoots and of course, noodles and soup.  Although their soup was a bit on the greasy side, it wasn't so fatty that I couldn't have any.  It was very flavorful.  The noodles were al-dente and definitely NOT the store bought kind where one gets a pack of three for $4.50 to cook at home.  \n\nI didn't have anyone to share the sushi or rolls with, but the ramen definitely was authentic enough.

I was looking for outstanding ramen while on a trip to SF, and Katanya was on several lists of top ramen joints, and very close to my hotel. I ordered the Katanya ramen (namesake bowl always seems like a good choice), shoyu, spicy. Their special ramen comes with 2 slices of chasu, 2 gyoza, 2 pieces karaage, corn, seaweed, and a half of a hard boiled egg (!?!). It was all just pretty disappointing. Broth was salty and spicy, but no real deep flavored. Chasu had an off taste. Gyoza were deep fried with a heavy-on-the-leek filling. Noodles were soft, nothing special. Everything tasted a little stale and pre-made. (I was there at 11:30, and was seated just as they opened). Nothing special at all. I probably only ate a third before becoming just bored with it.

I was fascinated by this option as typical ramen restaurants usually don't have much in their bowl of ramen, and would require you to order add-ons to make a filling meal.  Then, not only do you have your typical choice of soy or miso base, but you also have the option of rich or light broth.  This was a bonus for me, as I usually don't like rich broths.  The only downside was that if you wanted your bowl to be spicy, then you actually need to pay an additional $1.40.  Something about that just doesn't sound right.

Hmmm, red flag #1. Kidding. I was actually relieved since I was starving at that point. My selection of the night was the Katanaya ramen, salt flavor of course (pretty much tonkatsu). I've always used tonkatsu broth as my ramen benchmark, so I had to keep it consistent. On paper the dish seemed amazing. For about $12 you get a bowl of ramen with the works, including pork, egg, corn, seaweed, chicken karage and potstickers. All that in mah ramen?

I just didn't like the filling but I will put that bias aside and say the potstickers were a 4/5\nChicken Karage: The chicken karage was AWESOME! WHAT U KNOW BOUT THAT CHICKEN KARAGE?!?!? 5/5 it's a shame the rest of the bowl couldn't live up to it.\n\nSo yes, overall, the Ramen in my eyes is slightly above average. It's not bad, in fact it's good, but NO it does not stand out for me and honestly I cannot recommend this place to those seeking the BEST ramen.

The ramen makes this place as popular as it is, though admittedly, so does the location.\n\nThey have some pretty unconventional choices when it comes to the ramen in fact: kimchi ramen, cilantro ramen, karaage ramen.  The katana-ya ramen has a grab bag of things thrown into it, if you're feeling spontaneous.\n\nI'd recommend going with a combo: regular ramen with any one of around 20 to 30 sides (don, rolls, etc.).  You're asked to choose a broth (soy, salt, miso) and a broth richness (rich, medium, light).  Note that with a combo though, they'll withhold the egg and second slice of pork.  The noodles are of the straighter, less chewy variety.\n\nThat'll run you about $13 to $14.", "author": "Alex C."}

The fried chicken and gyozas are a great addition to the ramen, although I'd rather have them on the side so that they stay crispy instead of being swamped by soup. I got the spicy miso soup and it was really good. Not too rich, but just right. The medium spicy packs a pretty good punch, so I probably won't venture into the extra spicy realm. The major selling point for the ramen here I think is the noodles. They are a perfect consistency. Nice and chewy, the right thickness and they give you a decent amount of the noodles. \n\nThis place is really tiny. It has a counter/sushi bar and maybe 10 tables in it. We went on a Tuesday evening at about 7:30 and still had to wait about 45 minutes, so be prepared for a wait. Since this restaurant is kinda near the T-loin, you get a lot of homeless folks asking you for change and some randoms yelling things. Not too strange for SF, but it's good to know ahead of time. \n\nThe atmosphere inside is cozy (it has to be because it's so small) and casual. Service is decent. The prices are a bit high I'd say for ramen. The one I had, which I believe is the most expensive was about $13. The others started around 9 or 10 bucks, so not exactly your every day budget ramen place, I'd definitely recommend this place and come back here again.", "author": "Tyler C."}

When we were 1st approached by our waitress my fianc\u00e9 mentioned that she wasn't very friendly.

We ordered edamame, 2 spicy vegetarian ramen bowls,1 very spicy vegetarian ramen bowl, 1 large Sapporo and a sprite. The edamame was GROSS!! It was cold, and looked like it had been sitting out for an hour or more. We did not complain, but again passed this off as it being close to closing. Then the ramen came. She put the 1st bowl down and it was not seasoned with any spice at all. My fianc\u00e9 asked if this was the spicy ramen and she said \"No\" and walked away. The other 2 bowls of ramen came and honestly they all were so delicious!! I loved the ramen. Even the non-spicy was excellent. Very good!!! But that waitress was just rude and acted like we were inconveniencing her by being there. She almost ruined the experience, it was weird.

After walking a few blocks we went into the restaurant and put ourselves on the wait list. \n\nWhile we waited we looked at their menu and our appetites grew. Everything sounded so good that we began to get really hungry. They seated us after we reached the top spot on the queue (it took about twenty minutes but it was pretty damn busy). We were at the bar which was way cramped as was the whole restaurant. The servers were relatively nice and very good about keeping the water filled and serving us quickly.\n\nI ordered the regular soy sauce ramen and the grilled salmon fried rice. The fried rice came out first and it was amazing! The salmon was so flavorful and it wasn't greasy at all. Just as I was finishing the fried rice my ramen came so I didn't have to wait at all to start the main part of the meal. The ramen was pretty damn good. My ramen lacked interesting cuts of meat and veggies but that is because it was the regular ramen. My co-worker ordered the miso Katana-Ya ramen and it was ridiculous. He really liked all of the amazing flavors and textures in the dish.\n\nWe also each got a tonkatsu to go for eating the next day. When I ate the tonkatsu I was convinced that the restaurant is ridiculously delicious. Even though it was a day old, it was some of the best tonkatsu I had ever had.

I also fried my friend's kara-age ramen in shoyu broth, and miso definitely was much better.\n\nLet's talk about the broths first. Shoyu was in my opinion pretty bad. It was very salty, and tasted nothing more than soup and soy sauce. There was no depth to the broth at all, merely a flat and dead salty taste. Miso on the other hand was much better, though still slightly on the salty side. Flavorful, but i think the saltiness masked the miso flavors of the broth.\n\nThe ramen noodles were good, nice and tender. Kara-age and gyoza were nicely soaked in the broth, but even though the chicken was tender, it was kind of also very salty. The skin of the fried chicken crazily overpowered everything else. Fried gyoza was a bit boring.\n\nBasically I just felt like the chef here went crazy with the marinate and salt. All I could taste was the salt, and because of that, the ramen here felt very heavy. I got sick of the taste very quickly and wanted a change in flavor, but everything else in that bowl of ramen was just as plainly salty.\n\nI downed a lot of water.\n\nBasically this place is eh.

One random and unexpected thing about Katana-Ya is that they were the first to get me to try raw tuna and I've loved it ever since. It was at Katana-Ya that I discovered I like some sashimi but only when it's really fresh and the tuna at Katana-Ya was fresh!\n\nI digress.\n\nTheir claim to fame is of course the Japanese-style ramen. This is not your poor-college-student-Cup-Noodles establishment. The broth is hot and fragrant and seasoned and flavorful and warms you right down to your toes on those cold, foggy SF nights. You can order it so many different ways - with fried chicken, green onions, donkatsu, seafood, the list goes on - and the broth comes in 9 combinations as well (between the flavor base such as miso or regular and then the spiciness level). \n\nI'd recommend the spicy green onion ramen - it's got just enough kick to perk up your tongue but not enough that you need a fire extinguisher. \n\nIf you're looking for some simple Japanese fare, the combos aren't a bad choice either. You get regular ramen (with still your choice of one of nine combinations of broth) and a second item from a varied list including chirashi, donkatsu, tempura and others. \n\nThe wait can be anywhere from a few minutes to around an hour because the establishment is tiny.

The corn was sweet and provided a refreshing contrast to the rest of the meal. The fried thing-y was also quite tasty.\n\nThe noodles and broth, however, were not so good. The noodles weren't chewy (perhaps they were undercooked?) and the broth lacked dimension. It tasted like one of those frozen supermarket noodle packages you could prepare at home. \n\nThe meal wasn't bad. It was decent, but I will unlikely return as there are so many better ramen shops in the Bay Area.", "author": "Chiaming C."}

But after talking to a few veterans you hear that every good Ramen spot is outside of the city. Forget these people because they have never had real ramen in Japan. Which I have done. \n\nHere is the thing. Ramen is never going to be as good as in Japan. They literally have Ramen spots everywhere and I can only imagine, the skill and ingredients are just more readily avaiable over there. Can you imagine a ramen spot where one guy is dedicated to making noodles, another guy is dedicated to working on the soup, and another is dedicated to the chashu (pork)? Not likely in this economy. But in Japan most of the spots are like that. Dedicated to the Ramen art.  Not to mention the number of Ramen lovers has got to be higher. \n\nKatana-Ya is a very decent facsimile of Ramen in the city in San Francisco. \n\nThis restaurant is very close to union square in downtown San Francisco. And you can tell because there are many bums milling about the neighborhood.\n\nThis place is perpetually crowded. I swear everytime I go there is a crapload of people here. But its a very small hole in the wall type spot. \n\nOn to the food. The Katana-Ya Ramen is a great choice. Has everything in it. I go for the soy soup base. But I have tried miso as well and its very yummy. They have a good deal were you can get a bowl of ramen and some side for pretty cheap. \n\nThe gyoza is very tasty as well. The spicy tuna and misc sushi is very good also. \n\nYou won't find better ramen than this in the city. You will have to venture to San Mateo or San Jose for better fare.", "author": "Lawrence S."}

Lucky me, most people had already taken the rest of the week off work so my wait was only about 10 minutes or so.  \n\nThe second complaint is that the portions are small and pricey.  I would have to agree but I would rather pay more for less good food than pay less for massive quantities of crap.  I had the regular shoyu ramen because sometimes I think simple is better.  The noodles were fresh and chewy, which means they were cooked just right.  The toppings were really no different than most ramen places but the broth was excellent.  My fried had the katanaya ramen with miso broth and he really liked it.  I tried his broth and it was delicious.  I personally would never order that bowl just because as far as toppings there's way too much going on in there.  \n\nThe other complaint I heard a lot about was the fact that they use MSG in their broth.  Yes, I know MSG makes everything taste better so it's kind of cheating.  Yes, I MSG is bad for you but I don't eat here everyday so honestly I don't care.\n\nNeedless to say this place has it's flaws but there's not a lot of places out there that can top it, so quit your bitchin and go have some ramen.", "author": "Thao H."}

Its gotta taste better! \n\nChecking out the menu before-hand, I noticed that many people were recommending the miso ramen. Miso is interesting in that it tastes just as good when mixed with water (aka miso soup) as it does when mixed with soup stock (since the miso pretty much masks any other flavors). So I thought I'd try the shoyu (soy) ramen. A good shoyu ramen (IMO) balances the tastes of the soup stock with the rich salty goodness of soy sauce (or whatever blend is being used).\n\nI got nothing. A taste black hole, if you will. Its like someone took a bowl of ramen and removed every taste morsel from it surgically, and then served it to me. \n\nThe soup was the color of the sky in SF in July. Grayish and without life. There were bits of fat floating in the soup, but they were the kinds of fat that most other ramen chefs would discard for lack of flavor (most likely fat from chicken carcasses that wasn't discarded, instead of pork back fat that is added to the soup stock after it is been fully ready). The soup tasted like it had once been a shoyu, but had been stripped of it's shoyu-ness (new word) through cost saving dilution methods. The end result was a soup that tasted more like stone soup than shoyu ramen soup.\n\nBut I wish that was the only problem. \n\nOne of the chefs must have ran out of ramen noodles, because the noodles that landed in my soup were definitely of the spaghetti breed. Thick, round, straight, unable to hold any soup to them, and worst of all- soft. Not a little past al dente soft, but old folks home denture soft. \n\nFinally, the toppings. \n\nI could tell that the toppings were tuned to an American audience, which although not authentic, has worked out very well for their business. I will say this though. There was about 4x as much fried junk (fried gyoza torpedo and fried chicken pieces) in my katanaya ramen as chashu, which was tough and lacking in the flavor department anyways. \n\nIn conclusion, I'm not saying that YOU (the reader) shouldn't eat at Katanaya. Most people who eat it, love it. Just remember this: As much as you may like it now, it could, and should (because of all the people who line up outside to eat there) be better.", "author": "Dan L."}

I mean, that's all we care about right? I ordered the Katana-Ya Ramen that came with fried chicken & gyozas. I didn't know what to do with the chicken and gyozas at first...am I supposed to dump them into the broth? I still am not too sure but that's what everyone else did so I followed suit. So I then dug myself into the ramen and...\n\nIt was.....MEH. It was only OK, not even that great. Maybe my expectations were too high and maybe because I'm so used to eating Ramen down in LA (sooo gooooood), but Katana-Ya was a mile short of my expectations. The broth was nothing special. The ramen itself tasted like Top Ramen. The 1k+ people who gave this restaurant 4+ stars have obviously never tasted GOOD Ramen in their lifetimes.\n\nAfter waiting in the cold for 30 minutes and being cramped in a corner only to find out that the Ramen was BLEH...I don't think I'll be back, or at least not for a while.", "author": "David W."}

There was a 15-20 minute wait for our group of 4, but we just wandered next door to grab a drink. \n\nThe location is very small--less than 10 tables. It's a tight squeeze and you may end up bumping elbows a few times, but it's not too terrible. \n\nI ordered the Katana-Ya ramen with miso broth, extra spicy, as suggested by my friend/tour guide. First thing to note: BIG portions. I was able to split a bowl with a friend and still be fully satisfied. So for those on the petite side, I would suggest going halfsies with a buddy. The broth was delicious, and the \"extra spicy\" is just enough to make your mouth tingle without burning. The Katana-Ya comes with pork, half a boiled egg, a couple of pieces of fried chicken, and a couple of fried wontons. I wasn't a huge fan of the pork, but the fried chicken and wontons were super yummy. And duh, eggs are always a win. \n\nThe price seems a little high for ramen ($15/bowl), but that may just be my Houston bias coming through (Asian food in Houston is dirt cheap and delicious).

Since I was alone I slipped in the door and asked about a sushi bar seat, and voila, there was one right there for me. (FYI they have 5 sushi bar seats so I think that makes a single \"leftover\" seat for the solo diner more likely). \n\nI wasn't sure how or what to order, and I'm not really a noodle or soup fan, I mean, my thoughts about soup in general are that it's something to make less food seem like more food, you know? Like, add salty water and your stomach thinks you ate twice as much. I like *value* in my food. So I've generally avoided ramen, but everybody was having it and their menu seemed to foreground it. I will say the menu was a bit confusing, with a crazy front page illustrating various noodle combos in a big circular diagram, and so I just said to the waitress, what should I get, I'm hungry. She said the namesake ramen is a favorite, and I said I wanted some nigiri too and she seemed skeptical that I would be able to eat that much but I assured her I would be fine. However my initial idea of two sets of nigiri was talked down to one, and thank God she did, because what I got was a lot of food.\n\nFirst of all the hamachi was smooth and buttery, big slabs of fish on little clumps of rice. I realized suddenly that I'd been eating sub-par sushi so much lately (sorry, We Be) that I'd forgotten how good hamachi can be. \n\nThen, the ramen. The house-named ramen features fried chicken, a couple gyoza, half an egg, copious seaweed and green onion, and much much more, and a rich miso broth that absolutely exploded my concept of soup-as-a-watery-cheat. This was rich, dense, flavorful, *food*, and I devoured the giant bowl, paid like $30 for the sushi, ramen and a quality bottle of sake, and stumbled happily out into the rain, which didn't even bother me, because my brain was bathing in delicious warm broth.

In any case, when we did sit down, the service was pretty decent and friendly.  Most of my stars go to the food -- my unagi don was amazing!  The unagi (eel) was absolutely melting in my mouth, which is a sure sign of fantastic eel.  I can' even recall the last time I had eel that good.  The miso soup was also tasty, and my girlfriend loved her ramen as well.  Great broth.  \n\nThey are open 'til 1 AM, so if you need to go somewhere for a late dinner, this is a recommended choice.  I'm not sure how busy they are later on into the night, though; I went at about 7 PM.", "author": "Olga P."}

We waited for at least 30 minutes if not more until we were seated, and I personally didn't like our seating since it was near the stairs to what I believe was their storage room, not to mention it was a bit cramped. The upside to this place was it having a cozy and lively atmosphere.\n\nNow down to the FOOD! We both ordered the BBQ Pork Ramen, and you can't expect much since it is ramen after all. The size was adequate, but they definitely could have done better for the cost of the meal. The slices of pork had a interesting flavor, but they only had about five slices which was not enough for my hunger! :( The broth was another story.. I don't know how, but it was really really good and I don't know how to put it any other way. The noodles tasted like Udon and although it wasn't up to par to my tastes, it was significantly different than the noodles I've had before.\n\nOverall experience was decent and the service was mediocre.

The portions were big but the ramen itself was nothing more than average if evn that. What really made me give them the one star though isn't the food but the service. So right after our food arrived, my bf noticed a cockroach crawling on their mirror that was right behind me. So we called over the waitress and asked her to take care of the cockroach.

So I got up from my seat, and at that point, the two other waitresses noticed the cockroach too. But nobody did anything about it! I stood there for over 5 min before one of the waitresses brought out a guy cook from the back to kill the cockroach. Nobody seemed to want to do anything about it, but the cook was kinda forced to take care of it so he stepped onto my seat to get the cockroach.

Indeed, the ramen broth was very therapeutic in all its spicy and brothy goodness.\n\nIt is a small easy-to-miss joint, more like a store with tables than the a restaurant given its petite size.  Service is managed by one, but enough due to the managable number of tables.  We went around 3, an uncommon time for a meal, yet there were about three other tables.\n\nFrom the recommendations given, we ordered the spicy tofu ramen with the miso broth (photo), and the spicy tuna-covered california rolls (photo).  The broth was definitely evident that it was marinated carefully over time; \"miso\" broth is not to be confused with miso soup, which can be a quick stir of some bean curd and hot water with sprinkles of tiny tofu cubes.  No, this broth was different - the kind of stew you would savor and wonder, did the Japanese have a stew culture?\n\nThe bits of kimchi gave a crunch to the spiciness, although I am giving this four stars because I yearned for more crunch.  The tofu was the 1/2 inch thin, widely sliced tofu undressed, but I enjoy tofu of all kinds.  The ramen was a bit more thick, coarse consistency.  I ate about 70% of the tofu, kimchi and broth, and about 40% of the ramen.  Portion sizes were huge, however (the large bowls are brought out by hand and I can see the server's biceps bulge as she maneuvers one in each hand), so this is no indication of the tastefulness of the ramen.  \n\nThe spicy tuna california roll on its own I would give three stars for, just because I thought the consistency of the spicy tuna was decently comparable to what everyone else serves.  However, we came for the ramen, and the ramen we would come back for again.\n\nTwo ramens and the roll appetizer came out to about $24.", "author": "Theresa K."}

I am thankful for a friend who wanted us to check this place out, so we did, with the thought of ordering some delish ramen! \n\nThe restaurant is a TINY place. It's nicely decorated, but you WILL hit elbows with other customers! There are a lot of mirrors at the place, too. \n\nThe waiting staff have thick Japanese accents, but you will have no problem placing orders. They are use to the tourists who stop by their restuarant, so they are super friendly. \n\nSO. We ordered the regular ramen, miso base and it was milky-good! Though a bit salty for my taste, it was still very good. We also ordered a Sashimi Bowl with Rice. The sashimi was fresh and fairly tasty. \n\nFor both dishes, it was about $40. Not super cheap, but it was good food.", "author": "Melinda L."}

You also have the choice of rich, regular, or light broth.  I usually go soy and rich.  Not sure why anyone would go light, akin to ordering a lean pastrami sandwich.\n\nThe noodles here are decent, but I think the noodles at Suzu are better.  The broth at Suzu, though, leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe reason for four stars is because of the cold ramen they serve during the summer.  I ate here two days in a row recently, one day cold ramen and the other day regular ramen, and I definitely prefer the cold ramen.  The noodles are in a delicious dipping sauce, topped with chicken karaage, pork strips, omelette, seawood, veggies, pickles, and mustard.  The dipping sauce is solid.", "author": "David C."}

If you love Maruchan (yes, the cup kind that you used to eat to save money), then this might be too salty for you.\n\nThey really know how to heat up the spice without making it saltier.  Most other restaurants do that.  A richly flavored soup, without the salt, and plenty of chopped green onions floating around... getting the jist of this? Yum!\n\nPrice is decent (~$9 per bowl), though it's jumped in the past 2 years.\n\nAlso recommended: Donburi.\nNot really recommended:  Sushi rolls (not very big here!)\n\nAlso recommended:  Santa Ramen (in San Mateo).", "author": "Eugene L."}

Living in San Francisco I really wanted a local place for me to go to for my ramen fix. I was really really disappointed.\n\nThe 45 minute wait at peak dinner time was as expected for a place that was touted to be \"the best in the city\" and it only heightened the anticipation for me. Alas, it only set me up for disappointment.\n\nI ordered the shoyu chasu broth and it was way too salty and had a slight viscosity that I associated with not so good noodles. The slaty broth basically overpowered the rest of the bowl and for the first time in Karen's ramen history I could not finish the ramen.\n\nI'm sure Katana-Ya is \"the best in the city\" as it is definitely tough to find good ramen.

My roots were formed in a country where a hefty bowl of noodle soup (usually the curry type!) is considered the breakfast of champions.  And thus I'm seem to always be craving something similar.\n\nSo being that I'm often wandering about Union Square, I'm on the constant lookout for a cheap-but-tasty place for said noodles.  King of Thai is alright but can get pretty tiresome after a few times.  This place definitely fits the bill and lives up to it's Yelp reputation.  \n\nThe noodle and donburi combos provide a lot of food for under $10- and hey- noodles and rice- you don't even have to choose!  I had the ramen with rich soy broth for maximum flavor, and it was as delicious as I'd hoped.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and the soup was total comfort food.

I always like to order different things because I can get a taste of hers as well as my own.  In the Katanya Ramen it comes with corn, fried chicken, fried postickers, seaweed, scallion, BBQ pork & 1/2 a boiled egg.  Most Ramen places I have been to usually don't give enough noodles, so I asked for extra noodles for $2.00.  Not bad of a price.  It was a lot of extra noodles.  I was stuffed and devoured it in no time. \n\nThe combination of items in my Ramen was an interesting choice as I was indecisive of what to get.  The pot stickers were very good, the skin was pan fried perfectly and the meat filling was incredibly delicious.  The other thing I really like was the fried chicken.  The batter they use to coat it was very crunchy.  It wasn't over battered or fry too much, very flavorful.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with the Ramen.  I picked the miso soup base and it was very well balanced.  It wasn't over salty or plain it was perfect.  On the other hand, this place is worth the wait even if it's freezing cold outside.  Just a bit tiny and bit crowded with tiny walkways.  It is not the best neighborhood as it is listed in (union square), about a block away, near Jack in the Box and there are a lot of pan handlers.

Typical amongst their complaints: 1) It's not as good as that place in NY/LA/Tokyo/Wichita; 2) There's no tonkotsu broth; 3) There's MSG and it's salty and greasy.  Quite simply, they just like to bitch and moan.\n\nNow...that all said, on to Katana-Ya.\n\nIt's Wildly inconsistent.  In general, I'm pleased with the various ramens at Katana-Ya.  In particular, I like the one that comes with everything in it with miso broth.  Yeah, that miso broth is just thick enough but not too salty.  Also the noodles are nice and al dente.  No, Katana-Ya doesn't offer tonkotsu broth, but neither do many places in NY/LA/Japan/Wichita.  The broth isn't all that greasy either.  However, my friend Christina usually finds the broth to be too salty.  But she's a delicate flower who gets stressed easily.\n\nBut there's something really nasty lurking on the menu.  Sukiyaki-don.  To make it, I'm pretty sure they took a few scraps of beef, put them in a freezer for 6 months or until funky freezer flavor replaces that of beef, then boiled the fuck out of it until extra tough.

From other reviews, I think I went at the perfect time.. I arrived at 2:15 and placed my take-out order right away. There was tons of choices when ordering ramen- light, medium, rich.. miso, soy, etc.. I went with light miso ramen and it was delicious. I think they might have made the broth a bit rich as it was a little stronger than I was expecting but was great. I am watching my calories and know that this was a major no-no but I just had to do it.\n\nMy take-out portion was large and from what I saw on the tables in the restaurant, the bowls looked just as big. I could barely get through half of my soup so I'm saving it for later. The only thing is the price.. it is a little high for a standard ramen. I guess it is a little close to union square and attracts some tourist crowds, so they can justify it.", "author": "Seema M."}

The Katanaya Ramen does not offer anything special other than the chasu, which is the best thing in it, so just stick with that or even the regular ramen which comes with it.

There was some random reggae music in the background which helped set the tone. \n\nAs with most ramen shops I go to for the first time, I ordered the chashu pork ramen -- my general guideline and standard for food quality. Let's start with the broth. I had the light miso base. It was in a word, AWESOME. It was not overly salty and it had enough meat fat in it. Seeing the oily droplets on top of the soup was a good sight to see. There was also enough flavor which is great considering this was the light base and not the rich one, which they also offer. The noodles were nice. Chewy and great texture. The meat was nothing special by itself. I was surprised to have one cold piece of meat thrown in there. \n\nService was good. Waitresses were attentive and very polite. They were cute, too. Always a plus.\n\nI'm giving this place a 4.5 stars. It is not quite the best but it's up there.

Essentially the first three days my ex and I got to the SF area we had ramen... EVERY DAY. Katana-ya was stop #2 on this journey.\n\nAtmosphere: Okay this place is pretty small and cramped to be honest. The lighting is dim and seating is pretty tightly packed. We went at 3PM so we had no problems getting a table, but I can see how it would be difficult during regular hours.\n\nService: Given that there was only one other occupied table, the service was great. However I would assume that with a full house this might not be the case, but I can't be sure. I just feel that the restaurant layout is so cramped that it would be hard for the staff to navigate if all the seats were taken.\n\nFood: Okay so while I was not as big of a newb at this point, I still wasn't impressed. Both the Ex and I got the Katana-Ya ramen but I asked that the fried chicken be swapped out for an extra slice of Cha-Shu since I was still riding my Cha-Shu high from Misoya... WORST DECISION EVER. After trying the Cha-Shu it was quite flavorless and unexciting. On the other hand the fried chicken I stole from my Ex's plate was juicy and tender AND perfectly fried. Suffice to say, I had made a bad call. Otherwise the broth was decent, but not as rich or deep as that of Misoya. In addition while the Ex liked the sheer amount of \"stuff\" in the ramen, I didn't think it was necessary. By the time I got around to them, my gyoza were a soggy mess and I didn't want to eat  my Cha-Shu. The noodles were decent, not memorable so I'm guessing fairly standard ramen texture and flavor. The pricing is right on point with how much is in the bowl of ramen (as I mentioned... a lot of \"stuff\") so I'd say a decent value.\n\nOverall, given that there are better options around if you have a car I'd pass.

Everything was great except for a couple of minuses.. I will touch on that later. \n\nFirst, allow me to discuss the many pluses of this place. After a long day of walking around, my friend, who is an Elite yelper (=D), yelped this ramen place as our lunch destination. We ordered: Katana-Ya ramen with soy sauce base soup (2 of those), deep fried chicken ramen (2 of those; one soy sauce and one miso). Personally, I got the Katana-Ya ramen b/c it seemed like  signature and had a bunch of stuff in it (deep fried chicken, potstickers, 1/2 of an egg, and corn). Anyway, the ramen was delicious, cooked perfectly. The soup was great too, thanks to MSG. Great for a cold, rainy SF day. Another plus was the cute exterior look.. the red flag banners that hang just in front of the door reminds me of what ramen houses look like in Japan.. :o) Another plus was how quickly they were able to bring out the ramen, but then I guess, ramen doesn't take too long to make? \n\nNow, moving on to some minuses or \"deltas\".. First, the wait was a bit long.. we had to sign on the clipboard outside. However, I realize the wait time is something that they can't control.. definitely not a place for big parties, so pick your ramen buddy and partner up! Along that line, this place is actually extremely small.. we had a party of four and they sat us near the door, which was a table for 2, but they added 2 extra chairs and made it a table for 4... not to mention, it was awkward (I think) for my friend who sat by this other door (not the entrance, but it was a door to the back or kitchen or something), which kept opening and closing.. so it was rather distracting.. but we're pretty easy-going folks, so we laughed it off. Another minus is the price, I think it's a tad bit pricey for ramen, but I still paid for it and would probably come back again.. with a smaller party this time, so that we can get seated faster. \n\nSo, overall, still a 4; just b/c this place reminds of good authentic Japanese ramen (and no I'm not Japanese, but I've been to Japan).", "author": "Cassy H."}

She was accompanying me as I set out to finish the 7x7 list this year (I'm only at 44 as of this date).\n\nFirst of all, many friends found it crazy that I never had Katana-Ya. I've heard of it many times and have read the reviews, so I knew it was a place that lots of people put on their MUST GO TO lists.\n\nMy friend and I had the chasu ramen with miso broth on the 7x7 list and also got an order of rolls. I honestly can't remember the name of it unless I go through my receipt to see which one we got.\n\nNothing wowed me as I ate. The broth was alright, the pork was okay, the sushi was decent... I would've left this place giving it 3 stars.\n\nHOWEVER, I came by a couple of weeks later because I remember seeing a picture of their kimchi fried rice on the menu, and I told myself I'd come back for it. Yes, I know, it's not a Korean place so I shouldn't expect it to be good, but I was being hopeful anyway.\n\nI tried to place a phone order because i didn't have a long enough lunch break, but couldn't get through for over 30 minutes (FIX YOUR PHONE ON YELP!). I decided to stop by after work instead to grab dinner before the Pendulum show at the Fillmore, and with a bit of wait time (20 minutes maybe), I finally got my kimchi fried rice.\n\nThe thing that brought a smile to my face was that they gave me a side of miso soup (I love that stuff!). But when I started eating the kimchi fried rice, I wanted to cry for having wasted SO much of my time that single day while trying to satisfy my kimchi fried rice craving.\n\nIt looked NOTHING like the picture on their menu. It was a light dullish brown color with some meager vegetables tossed in. It looked and tasted more like Chinese fried rice with veggies, and the taste was definitely LACKING. Not a single bit of kimchi in sight! I'm upset that I even asked them to make it as spicy as they could. What a FAIL. That's what happens when you order a Korean style dish at a Japanese restaurant - partially my fault.\n\nNote to the restaurant, if you're going to sell/make something on your menu, make sure it looks remotely the same. And also, maybe take this item off the menu. Stick with only the ramen because this place is known as a ramen house.", "author": "Melissa D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-21", "description": "Prior ramen experience in the Bay Area includes Hotei in the Sunset, Ramen Club in Burlingame, and Santa Ramen in San Mateo.\n\nOverall, I was really satisfied with the ramen at Katana Ya. I think it is comparable and probably slightly better than Ramen Club, but I can see myself still going to Ramen Club more often because the wait is shorter and the parking is easier. \n\nThe food:\n\nI ordered the Katana-Ya Ramen. Basically this ramen includes chicken karaage (friend chicken), deep friend gyoza (potstickers), your regular ramen pork, green onions, butter corn, bamboo shoots, and a broth of your choice (soy, miso, salt). I have never had a ramen with both fried gyoza and karaage before, so I really enjoyed this new variety. The combination of all these components surprisingly worked. The ramen noodles themselves were cooked perfectly, not too soggy, nor overly chewy. The soy broth I chose was not too salty, yet flavorful enough. Furthermore, I felt the proportions were perfect, it filled me up just fine =).\n\nIn comparison to my current favorite, Ramen Club, I would say the quality of food seems slightly better. Everything was cooked almost to perfection and the flavors were spot on. Ramen Club can just be as good and actually has (I believe), more variety in terms of ramen choices, but it can also be inconsistent in terms of quality. Therefore, I would say if it was just based on food - I would go to Katana Ya over Ramen Club. Hotei is my least favorite and won't even disrespect Katana Ya by making such comparisons, and Santa Ramen is just plain far and the line is too long for me to like it much either.\n\nThe service:\n\nEh - Let' s just say they get the job done. They sit you, take your order, clear the dishes, and give you the check. Smiles? Friendliness? Well, i guess that's extra. Nonetheless, the mediocre service wasn't bad enough to detract from the good food. Basically I felt that the waitstaff know this restaurant is still a hot place to go and need not waste energy on service to keep the customers coming. \n\n*Note that I came on a Sunday and got there 5 mins before opening (12pm) and 10 mins after i sat down, the whole restaurant was filled already and a line was formed outside the door.", "author": "Nathan T."}

However, it's the only decent bowl of ramen that I can find that is central in the city. I know there's good ramen in the Sunset and the Richmond but let's be real... I'm not going to travel that far just to eat some ramen. \n\nMy favorite is the fried chicken ramen with miso-flavored soup. Be sure to ask for the fried chicken on the side otherwise it gets soggy. Honestly, I really think that Katana-ya has the best fried chicken (karrage). It's lightly breaded, boneless dark meat that is full of flavor. You dip that karrage into your soup, and it's a little bite of heaven. The chasu ramen is on the 7X7 list and I don't understand why. The chasu is kind of bland and not fatty enough. I've had much better chasu ramen at other places.\n\nI'm a fan of their sushi rolls and I like how they have other dishes besides just ramen. It's nice to have the option to order sushi, fried rice, etc. \n\nThis place is TINY. Be prepared to wait for an hour or more if you come at a peak time. I've had to wait at 10pm on a Wednesday before. Is it worth the wait? I think it is because I find a big bowl of hot soup with noodles so comforting.

But when I looked at my neighbors at the sushi bar as well as the possible choices on the menu, I don't think ramen is their \"item\" to get here. \n\nA typical place that serve ramen usually wouldn't have a sushi bar as well. But since I was alone sitting and looking at the possible sashimi choices, I made the last minute decision of getting the chirashi sushi. \n\nAs you know, chirashi sushi is one of my gauges for authentic Japanese food in America. The sashimi places were fine, but what is with the brown rice??? I understand that it's more healthy, but brown rice just ruins the traditional taste of the meal. Moreover, the dish is $19! The most I think I've ever spent on chirashi sushi. \n\nThe service was almost nonexistent after my dish was given to me. No refill of tea. The non-Japanese sushi chefs were not conversational and kept to themselves rather than chatting with customers. I even saw one of the sushi chefs eating his dinner right next to the sushi bar in sight of customers. Is that okay? \n\nMy self-compensation for a mediocre dinner? A single scoop of Earl Grey and Salted Caramel ice cream from Bi-Rite.  \n\nIf you like authentic ramen experience in the Bay Area, try Santouka Ramen in SJ: http://www.yelp.com/biz/santouka-san-jose-2", "author": "Kenny L."}

Being a cold, rainy, and windy December evening, we wanted something close by.\n\nSomething soupy and warm was going to hit the spot just right. I decided to whip out my handy dandy iPhone and enlist the help of the yelp app. The first hit when querying 'ramen' was Katana-Ya. With a four star average over a thousand reviews, it seemed like a safe bet.\n\nThere was a bit of a wait even though it was 10pm on a Saturday evening. I think we ended up waiting about thirty minutes. Once we entered the restaurant, I realized how small the inside really was. Despite the fact that the tables were cramped together, it looked to be quite a popular date spot.\n\nAs a table, we ordered a couple appetizers:\n\n-Gyoza\nThey were average. I've had better, I've had worse. I believe the plate arrived with four pieces on board.\n\n-Chicken Kaarage\nThese were pretty good I thought. The plate came with a creamy, mayo-type sauce and the standard lemon wedge. The pieces were meaty without having too much batter.\n\nAnd, I ordered:\n\n-BBQ Pork Salt ramen (mild spiciness)\nThe first thing I noticed about the soup base was the overwhelmingly spicy flavor. Mild had some kick to it! Compared to ramen and curry shops in LA, I'd consider Katana-Ya's mild at least a medium, if not more. Either that, or I was having a very weak sauce day.\n\nFor the supposed best ramen in SF, I walked away quite disappointed and so did my friends. I can affirmatively say that I've had better ramen in LA, even at what I'd consider second tier shops. I'm guessing Socal does have a relatively larger Japanese population?

That being said get your name signed in on the clipboard and grab a menu to take a look at what you're interested in trying at Katana-Ya.\n\nI recall Katana-Ya is best known for their Ramen, but they do have a lot of other choices if you're not in the mood for Ramen.  I saw sushi, udon noodles, soba noodles, salads, and donburis on the menu as well.\n\nI decided to try Katana-Ya's Ramen to compare it to the other ramen houses I've tried in the Bay Area. It did not WOW me to place it at the top of my list and it wasn't at the bottom of my list either.\n\nTo start off, you're provided with three choices for the soup base: Soy Sauce, Miso, and Salt.  I like how you are able to customize it with a lighter or darker broth.  If you like spicy, you can request it make it spicy for an extra surcharge. I remember it was about $1.50 extra to make it SUPER spicy. The broth looked NUCLEAR red. I'd probably be interested in trying this bowl of noodles next time.\n\nFor my order, I picked the BBQ pork ramen with the light Soy Sauce broth for $10.50.  My bowl had 4 slices of the pork, which were lean, but were also quite tough to chew on. Accompanying the pork, the bowl of ramen also had bamboo, seaweed, scallions.  The ramen noodles reminded me of the noodles they had at Santa Ramen and that's a good thing. The noodles were not as springy though, most likely because they cooked it longer.\n\nOn the side, I also had an order of Hamachi hand rolls that were $5.00 each.  The fish was fresh, but the pieces of fish were not big at all. I remember eating mostly rice by the time I got to the middle of hand roll. This is a good indication at least that the fish they use for their sushi is fresh and tasty.\n\nWhen I look back at my experience, I don't believe it was worth the 30+ minute wait to get a table.  There are a plenty of other ramen houses in the Bay Area that serves up a tasty bowl of ramen without the long wait.\n\nA big PLUS of Katana-Ya is that it accepts credit cards and not just CASH like many other ramen places.", "author": "Jason H."}

We perused the ridiculously option-heavy menu and settled on shoyu ramen with an unagi roll combo for me and a bowl of soba with chicken for her. They were training a new server that day who was pretty clueless. Even though the first server dropped off water, we waved and gestured futilely to try and get the new server's attention in order to request tea. Finally, another server noticed us and brought back the lukewarm tea.

They quickly resolved the order, but I was surprised that they got it wrong in the first place.\n\nThe ramen noodles were medium width and straight. They were cooked a bit on the softer side. The soup, which I ordered regular, was just okay. The shoyu was a bit thicker than other places, but not very deep in flavor. The bowl was garnished with several pieces of seaweed, a handful of pickled bamboo shoots, green onions, and a single dry slice of roasted pork. Where is my half slice of boiled egg? The portion size was okay, but I wasn't that impressed overall. As for the unagi roll, there were tiny fish bones stuck to the rice which were odd. The roll itself was nothing memorable. My sister said her soba was quite bland and helped herself to a couple of spoonfuls of my shoyu soup. I tried the noodles and they were cooked beyond limp, which is why I guess soba is usually used for dipping. The chicken was boiled and tasteless and the soup and garnishment of napa cabbage didn't add anything.\n\nI'm not sure about the popularity of this place, or the line that formed outside the door.

I ordered the spicy tofu and substituted the ramen noodles for Udon noodles for an extra $1 charge. I also go the miso flavor with thick broth.  The portions are quite large(especially mine since I used the udon noodles which needed a much larger bowl). The flavor was good but I didn't think it was very spicy.

Now I know the types of things I like, so I was hoping that would help me this second time around.\n\nThere are three broth types: miso, soy sauce, and salt.\nThen you can select: rich or light.\n\nThere are also various options of types of ramen.\n\nI was sad to see that there was no pork (tonkotsu) broth, because all other broths I tried, I didn't like. I did remember trying a sip of my friend's Salt broth at Tanpopo before and I think it's just a plain broth.\n\nI decided to get the Spicy Green Onion Ramen with rich broth in salt. Good choice! My favorite of the broths my two friends and I got. One friend got the Katana-Ya Ramen which comes with everything with the miso rich broth and that was good, too, though I liked mine a little. Mine came with plenty of green onion sliced very thinly so you can eat them, and one piece of pork. The broth was oily, which I didn't mind, probably \"rich\" just means more fat. Can't remember what the last friend had, but I think it was a light broth since she didn't specify, and I didn't like that as much.\n\nMaybe I just like more rich broth which is what Tonkotsu (pork) broth is. Helps me re-evaluate what I like about ramen.\n\nWasn't too much of a wait for us either, which I was surprised about. Came around noon on a Saturday, put our names on the list and waited about 10 minutes.

The chefs are fast at preparing the meals since my roll was a handmake it didn't take that long and the quality of the fish that night was pretty good. It took about maybe a good 15 mins or so to get the signature ramen out to me and it was spicy as requested. Unfortunately I didn't get too many add on's this time since I was on a budget. What I did like was it was a bit more spicier than the ramen that I had at Izakaya. First time I ever had chicken karaage in my ramen. It went pretty well that night but I didn't get any alcohol. I did leave on a full stomach as always. I was a bit upset at how one of the patrons came a bit after me but the didn't finish their meal. I remember hearing the waitress asking if he would like it to go but he left it there. Such a waste of ramen... but maybe he had some other issues. \n\nI'd go back here cause its not hiding away from any of the main streets.

There is a long pause where I was thinking one of the 3 things was going to happen:\n\nA) The chick would be kicked out\nB) The couple would kick the chick's ass\nC) The chick would puke everywhere and slip on her vomit\n\nInstead, the write-in candidate prevailed. The couple asked the hag to join them! WTF!? After a 30 minute convo with them, the nice couple leaves with their eyes rolling. At this point, the drunky is out on the prowl again..and finds some nice people with yelp staff sweatshirts on. To my amazement, they offer her a seat too!!!\n\nWTF peeps! I know you prolly want to point and laugh at the drunky, but seriously...asking her to plop a sqat is always a bad call. Didn't your momma ever tell you to not talk to strangers?? I give them a fishing reel type gesture...which is of course universal sign language for \"you need a bail out?\" to which I get some rapid nods...from none other than my BFF Charlotte (who I just noticed was there)!! Anyways, I tried my best to lure her away, but failed after a few attempts. I had to run away before I got the drunky strain of black death all over me. Hope the rest of you cool peeps at that table fared OK, and didn't wind up with too much drool on your cheeks from some drunk granny kisses :).\n\nIn sum, go to this place.

I ordered the katanaya ramen bowl and substituted the chicken for tofu, which was apparently too difficult to do. My soup was supposed to have gyoza in it, which it did not, and also a substitution for the tofu meant no pork slices for me :-/ There was a party of 4 that sat next to us 10 minutes after we were seated (we already had our drinks - hot sake was good) who ordered the same dish and got served before us. There was one waiter working, who got some assistance from time-to-time from another person in the kitchen. It must've been way too busy for them to handle and also I saw an absolutely enormous takeout order being prepared after we ordered, so that was probably part of the problem of the food-bringing-out service being incredibly slow. 4 other patrons were getting horribly antsy too. The food was good, maybe not worth the wait. Whoever ordered that giant takeout order was a dick.", "author": "S S."}

I was intrigued, and went to give it a try, so we braved the line that went out the door and waited for a booth to open up.  I'm going to get my biggest gripe out of the way right now, the service, it was not very good, the waitress we had seemed to be in a pretty bad mood.  I'm not sure if she was just having a bad day, but after seeing some of the reviews it seems that may just be based more on her personality.  Even after she took our order, I finished my tea and asked for more, she looked at me, gave me a sigh, when she returned, she was darting through the tables holding the tea cup, she without stopping she poured the tea and kept walking, it would have been an amazing accomplishment, but she left a significant sized trail of tea that went from my cup to the edge of the table towards me.  I ended up cleaning up the mess but when I asked for more napkins she seemed even more annoyed.\n\nMoving on from the meal I had the the house specialty, the Katanaya ramen, which actually was really, really good, you could almost say, that if this was based purely on the food in itself, it was fantastic.  The broth had a rich depth of flavor, someone in the back did a great job at laying the flavor profiles of vegetables and meats, the noodles themselves was perfectly cooked, slight bite to them which is what I love.  The other thing that I loved was that the hard boiled egg was actually a bright golden yellow, no hint of green in it which drives me nuts.  The only gripe I could come up with was that the little fried chicken pieces in here were served on the side, by the time we got ours, it was getting a little more soggy.  I've tried a few of their rolls which was pretty good as well, one that we had some some type of Hawaiian roll, had some eel, hamachi and tuna.\n\nWhile we were enjoying our ramen the waitress came back and dropped off our bill.  I assumed she wanted us to clear out quickly, the funny thing was that after we finished up of meal it took us a while to flag her down so we could pay the bill and even once she took it it seemed she forgotten about us.  We eventually, got our change, and got up, to exit and maneuver through the crowd outside eagerly waiting for a table.  When I left I felt really torn about how I should approach this review, as it's really unfortunate when good food is spoiled by horrible customer service.  I'm sure some will critic that \"the food is worth it\" or \"its the best I've ever had.\"  I hope this was a rare occurrence, as you can only be a good restaurant and have customers lined up out the door, and at the same time treat customers so poorly, for only so long.  As for me, I think for the time being I have a couple ramen joints that I prefer, and I think the food tastes better when you aren't having to sit on pins and needles worried you are going to offend your server.", "author": "Chris T."}

A bowl of that would cost me less than a dollar, why would I pay someone else to heat up water, boil noodles and serve me their version of cup of noodles and charge me ~$10/bowl?!!??  The idea was so insane to me!  \n\nThat is until I tried katanaya!  I first experimented with the Katanaya Ramen with miso broth and devoured every delicious slurp.  Something about the the savoriness of the miso broth and the chewiness of the fresh egg noodles kept me craving for more. \n\nAfter experimenting with a few items on the menu, I'd have to say that the spicy tofu soup ramen would have to be my favorite bowl at this tiny, lively, bustling place.   The tofu is the perfect softness and smoothness, the napa cabbage adds a nice bite to the dish and the broth remains rich and delicious.  A side order of chicken karaage gives the entire meal a crunchy and satisfying finish.   \n\nSushi is alright, not that impressive but keep in mind that sushi is not he main attraction.

Small place, Japanese-owned apparently, which definitely does make a difference.  We ordered the kanaya special ramen (with 2 pieces of chicken karaage, 2 gyoza, 1 chashuu, corn, onions).  I had the salt version and my friend had the miso.  Orders came out quick and hot, and the service was good.  Gotta say that the miso has a better flavor (and i'm normally stricly a tonkotsu kinda guy, but alas, they didn't have tonkotsu).  Mine was good too.  Noodles were nice and fresh and cooked perfectly.  Soup tasted good, not too salty.  Portion was pretty good too.  Not the best ramen i've ever had (since i've had some damn good ramen in japan), but definitely very good.  As usual, but pricey for ramen, but i guess that's the trend now, but at least the portions here weren't kid sized (lookin at you Orenchi).\n\nEdit:\nGotta knock it down to 3.5 stars.  Went there yesterday and again got the katanaya special and a side dragon roll.  The ramen soup base (salt) is really lacking in taste.  The portions remain pretty good with generous portions of karaage & large pot stickers, but the soup base pretty much killed it for us.  The dragon roll was very well made, but tiny.  Especially for the price of $13.50.  I'd expect 8 pieces, not 6 small ones.  But that said, very well made.", "author": "B W."}

Heard about Katana-Ya from a friend saying it had some nationwide nods as well as from other people I know that rave about it. So I was pretty excited to finally come and check it out. And of course you can tell a place is good when people are willing to wait outside in the frigid air. OH YES.\n\nWe were a party of 5 but still needed to wait a bit longer for a latecomer. As we were driving up, searching for parking, a friend of mine saw the hoard of people standing outside and requested to get out of the car so he could put his name down on the list for us. That's how smart you have play it. What a good friend. It was only a 15 minute wait but once entering the place, I could see why. \n\nKatana-Ya isn't the roomiest of all places. Hell, it's a claustrophobic's nightmare. Tables are a bit small. Seating seems limited. But meh...whatever. For all I care, I can be sitting in a cardboard box, while eating the greatest dish on earth, and I wouldn't mind. Besides, the only space that should matter is in our stomachs and whether or not we have enough room leftover for dessert. \n\nThe Spicy Tofu Ramen, with Misu, was the choice of my liking. I was hesitant at first by the \"Spicy\" label but my neighbor over at the table next to me said it wasn't that spicy. And indeed he was right. The ramen was very warm and tasty. The Misu broth was dead on. Spiciness is manageable, even if you don't eat a lot of spicy food. Gave me a good warm feeling all over. We also ordered a Rainbow roll and Golden roll. The rolls were decent but I know I've had better. Keep in mind: RAMEN is their specialty. Not sushi.\n\nBetween the 5 of us, we also ordered 2 bottles of large (HOT) sake. Very hot indeed. But unlike the sake, the service was not so hot. We ordered a 3rd bottle of sake but they failed to retrieve it for us. And after repeatedly telling them of our request, they still added it to our bill. What the eff, right? We expected them to bring us our 3rd bottle but instead they just took it off our bill because they accidentally charged us. Good job. Sorry for giving them business, I guess. But besides that incident, service was pretty good all night.\n\nAnywho, despite the mediocre wait and the service mishap, the ramen was awesome and the times were fun. We came on a Friday night so of course we knew what we were walking into. But just don't let that stop you from coming here. I would mos def come back. Just you wait.", "author": "Will S."}

After 5 months of searching, I finally stumbled across this spot on my way home and was astonished to find a ramen restaurant only 3 blocks from my apartment!  \n\nI admit, I was suspicious at first being the area is in a undoubtedly shady spot... be prepared to be accosted by bums outside  the Jack in the Box on the corner. \n\nNow the food. The ramen is legit!  Finally platable ramen, soba and udon for great prices.  It's not the best ramen I've ever had, but it's the closest I could find to the real deal!   I'm a fan of rich broths, so I was very happy to discover they give you the option to make your broth rich or light!  I always get the miso (rich) ramen, though I've tried the soba several times. if you're not sure if you want soup or rice, or sushi, or a fried cutlet...fear not!  They have a great combo section where you can pick a ramen, udon or soba and choose a rice dish topped with a huge variety of morsels like BBQ beef, Spicy Tuna (AMAZING), Unagi, sashimi bowl....you name it...it's there!  Really great deal for the variety, also great for a first date. \n\nI usually get the Katana-Ya Ramen, which has corn, seaweed, scallion, two dumplings, two fairly sized pieces of fried chicken morsels, and half a hard boiled egg. That's a serious meal that keeps me full for a long time! I do wish though, that they gave the dumplings and fried chicken OUT of the bowl...I don't understand why you'd fry something to dump it into a soup...\n\nA small spot with some serious lines starting at 7pm, but worth the wait.  The only real disappointment for me is that they don't offer tonkotsu ramen, also known as kyushu ramen, which is my favorite hands down. \n\nI gave it 4 stars, because sometimes the service just outright sucks. I stood in the doorway with a friend for near 10 minutes waiting to be seating and finally when two couples plowed right by me and plopped down, I went up to the waitress and asked if I was supposed to seat myself. Maybe I was, I don't know, but she didn't even acknowledge our existence the time we were there. She replied, \"Oh! I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were waiting!\"   \n\nAlso, actually ordering your food can take a while, but the food does hit the tables pretty quickly.", "author": "Annie W."}

The funny thing was after we were seated, we were told that there was another party before us, when clearly before I decided to seat, I didn't see any other name above me that hadn't been scratched out. Anyway, we were told to stand up and wait again for another 15minutes. As much as the waiter kept apologizing for his mistake, I think he should tell that other party to wait cause of his mistake, not us!\n\nBack to menu, I ordered Cilantro Ramen, my cousin ordered the Spicy Green Onion Ramen with Kurobuta Sausage. Both of them were priced below $10 per bowl, simply said that this location located in Union Square, that price was quite affordable. \n\nComing from LA where all the ramen were much better, I was kinda expecting this one to be good as my friends told me, \"this is the closest you can get to LA ramen\". My respond after eating it, \"Nah, it doesn't even come close\". \n\nYeah okay, they have all different flavor that I never seen before and that's why I ordered them, but the ramen tasted like rubberband to begin with, so chewy, definitely not fun to eat and the meat given was so little, I needed to search for any meat underneath the broth. The Kurobuta sausage that my cousin got was huge and plenty for that small portion bowl, taste wise, it's okay. \n\nWill I come back?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-15", "description": "In short: I love a good bowl of ramen and this tiny little establishment did not disappoint.  However, I believe there are better bowls of ramen in the SF Bay Area that are easier to access, and of course, it does not stack up to some of the best I've had in Japan or even NYC.  Chasu as tough as finding parking in the neighborhood, and hurried service are its pitfalls.  Its boons are customizable bowls of ramen and the yummy fried chicken ramen.\n\nIn long: The restaurant service is very efficient and they expect their patrons to be equally efficient.  We were hurried out of the restaurant by their staff who needed our table for more hungry downtown metropolitan types.\n\nMy advice is to arrive at 6:00 pm sharp.  At that time, parking meters retire for the night and you beat most, but not all, of the dinner-time rush.  We arrived at 6:00 and had to wait about half an hour for a table for around 6-8 of us.  \n\nThe menu dictates to its reader the exact quantity of Chasu you will receive as 3 pieces.  When some of our ramen bowls came out with only 2 slices, it was very disappointing.  These guys are so determined to meter Chasu to their customers and yet they still get it wrong.  I didn't mind because their Chasu was too tough in comparison to other ramen houses.  \n\nHighlights to me were the quality-fried and well-battered fried chicken in the fried chicken ramen bowl.  Hint: get a small plate on which to extract the tender fried morsels from your soup and prevent them from getting soggy.  Then you can take your time enjoying them.\n\nFinally, the soup in your bowl is customizable in it's viscosity.  I left my soup at default setting and it seemed just a touch too light on flavor, though not offensively so.  My friend had a \"thick\" soup base and she seemed to enjoy hers much more.  Their thick is like some other restaurants' normal ramen soup base.  The noodles have a good al dente feel and stays decently firm and chewy until basically the end of the bowl.  Although I tried my lady's ramen noodles after my bowl and they were getting soggy.    \n\nIn sum, a good bowl of ramen for downtown SF.  If the South Bay is not too far, around Saratoga there are some other great ramen houses.", "author": "Gersey C."}

If the review was solely based on the ramen, they would deserves 3 stars.  \n\nTaking both ramen and sushi into consideration, I am still giving them 3 stars because I've been to places where I've had better ramen (maruichi's in Mt.

Really fresh ingredients and the whole thing just melted in your mouth.  California roll was good too, but it was typical, nothing special.\n\nNOT A FAN: Lava flow was just literally shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna on top - for $13.50 I just can't get over how expensive that was.  It was pretty good taste wise, but for that price I should have just ordered the alaskan.  Toro nigiri was just okay. I didn't think it was the freshest.  Philly roll - not a fan of cucumber would rather have avocado, it's  my own personal preference so other's might like it.\n\nThe overall experience was 3 stars because I feel like everything I ordered is I've had better.

But in the end I didn't want to give up no ramen.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased. They have earned their title of best ramen joint in SF.\n\nI ordered a spicy ramen with tofu and ground pork. Their noodles are just the right consistency, firm and a little chewy. The broth was great! At first, as I was eating the noodles, I felt that it wasn't spicy enough. But with my second spoon of broth and noodles, I got that wonderful spicy kick at the back of the my throat. Also it had just the right balance of salty and sweet. Note: I asked for the broth in light. The soup also had just the right amount of protein to go with the noodles (pork and tofu)\n\nPros: Can get broth in regular, light or miso; staff is very friendly; light underground/midground hip hop playing in the background\n\nCons: long lines/wait; in the ghetto loin/downtown (lots of tourists and crackheads)", "author": "Karen U."}

A good gauge of how much I like a ramen place is whether finish everything I order. The two times I was there I did just that -- whether it's miso broth or spicy broth, I finished everything, including the soup. \n\nThis is the closest I've had to good ramen places in Japan. But granted it is not for everyone -- it is good only if you like ramen cooked in a particular kind of Japanese style, a style that is different from soup noodle dishes you find around the city. The broth is strong and flavorful -- perfect for me, but a bit on the salty side for some of my friends. The noodles are cooked al dente -- again, perfect for me, but people used to Chinese style noodles might find it a tad undercooked. \n\nThe place is tiny, and the wait is long.

They have combos with sushi, sashimi, rice bowls.  I chose the miso light broth with spicy tofu.  My fiance picked the the soy broth with a rice bowl side $14 my bowl was about $10.  I have to say the broth was yummy, very flavorful.

I have been enjoying eating Ramen since I was a kid and although my favorite ramen here in the states was from this place back home in Honolulu called Taishoken (which unfortunately closed a few years ago), this one from Katana-Ya sure came close to it, in terms of the taste of the broth, the noodles and the garnishes!

The ladies are so nice.  I got the Katana-Ya Ramen with the miso base soup.  It comes with the typical ramen egg, bbq pork, but with the gluttonous twist of potsticker and fried chicken.  Not the southern style fried chicken but the asian style fried chicken which oddly complemented very well with the miso base and noodles.  Who would thought?  But eat it quick or else it becomes soggy.  My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach because I barely finished half.  I kept digging at it but no progress.

And how could it not be, boasting stellar reviews from 'professional' foodies and amateurs alike? As a Seattle girl I don't usually get the opportunity eat real, delicious ramen and so it was my goal to eat it as much as possible and from as many places as possible in SF.\n\nKatana-Ya is a tiny little joint in almost-the-Tenderloin-district (or maybe it's not 'almost'-- I have no idea). The line was out the door when we arrived, with more people on the sidewalk and street than in the actual restaurant itself. We were forced to look in with sad, hungry eyes and watch as people delightfully slurped up their noodles and crunched on gyoza with the hope that we, too, would soon be members of the happy ramen-eating elite. Fortunately the wait did not actually kill me and I was able to plop down and order the house namesake ramen which has basically everything in the world heaped into the bowl. I chose the shoyu broth, being a little thrown off by the options between that, miso, and salt and I think I made the right choice. The fried chicken might have been a bit of overkill, as were the gyoza since we also ordered them as an appetizer, but I made it through the monster of a bowl and had to force myself to stop despite feeling like somewhat of an overinflated, broth-filled balloon. It was a little on the pricier side from what I recall, but for the amount of food you get I'm not going to complain.\n\nThe best part about Katana-Ya is that they serve food super late so all of you late diners can still partake in yummy ramen after the bars. Bonus for late-night dining is that the wait basically doesn't exist! I highly suggest coming with a hungry friend and ordering combos because nothing is more satisfying than being able to eat more things for less money.", "author": "Lisa N."}

I also got some sushi last time I was there, and that was definitely not-worth-it.\n\nMaybe I'm just not a ramen guy (this is actually the only place I have ever had ramen) but for the price it seems there are much better options.

I was seated promptly, a guy came out to give me tea and water, and my waitress took my order after I checked out the menu. I had the spicy tofu ramen, and I liked it a lot. It was good. Although when I was ordering, I kind of had the urge to run out of there because it said on the menu they add MSG. And being on a recent \"health kick\" I didn't know if this was such a good idea. But I ordered the ramen, and it was tasty: it had a nice little kick of spicy, and the soft tofu was plentiful. I'm not sure if they make their own ramen noodles, but to me it didn't taste like it.\n\nI did enjoy the food, but I think what I didn't like was the service during the end of my meal. My waitress didn't seem to notice me (even though there were tons of mirrors everywhere that I could see my own reflection in all corners of the restaurant). And though someone else came to clear away my food I literally watched my waitress pass me by about ten times catering to everyone else around me (by then the dinner rush was starting, and she just kept going around to everyone BUT me). I was done for almost ten minutes! She never came to check on me at all, and I didn't really enjoy that. And towards the end she finally realized I was done eating, and gave me my check... but someone else's! Ramen does NOT cost 20 bucks. Anyway, I told her, she said she was sorry, but by the end of it I wanted to get out of there.

That and Yelp-induced inertia. \n\nI came early in the night with 3 small groups ahead of me ~30 min wait. I had the Katana-ya ramen w/Ikura-uni don.\n\nKATANA-YA RAMEN: has chicken karaage, fried dumplings, chashu, and egg.. soo BOSS! Unfortunately, they failed at making any of those appetizing. \nThe noodles were decent. Good noodles are of the thicker variety IMO and has a good al dente bite. Their ramen... was better than instant noodles. Their broth was also not memorable.\nThe kicker of the dish were the toppings -- but they were poorly done. It's a shame and an irony that the flagship/name-bearing dish sucks.\nThe key to having fried ingredients in a soup is to fry to perfection and serve IMMEDIATELY. Katana-ya got the latter half right. However, the fried pot-stickers tasted like hollow nothingness - no substance. \nThe chicken was a poor excuse for karaage - was this pan fried or pan-reheated? \nThe egg was plain and hard-boiled -- no flavor/not soft boiled? What ramen style is this? \nThe chashu was overly lean and borderline tough. Seriously, what kinda style is this? Lean chashu? Show me the FAT! \n\n\nIKURA/UNI DON: The idea of this is awesome. Ikura-don is one of the richest side-dishes for ramen. Top that off with uni? Heaveeen right? Somehow, this rubbed my taste buds in the wrong way. Was it the uni? The ikura? Something had a metallic aftertaste. *puts bowl down*\n\n\nNOTE: Don't come in large parties. The group that left after we got seated looked disappointed. The restaurant is too small and understaffed for them to make you guys happy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION: Although I went with no expectations, I still found this place sub-par and not very memorable.

It was a cold November night...the night before Thanksgiving.  We had just had a few beverages down the street at  Amsterdam Cafe and needed a late night place to hit before heading back to the hotel.  I trust my fellow yelpers, so we walked (briskly) to Katana-Ya.  On a cold winters night in the city all I could think about was a big old bowl of soup - ramen to be exact.  The Japanese comfort food I was raised on!\n\nWe stop in about 45 minutes before close. I was VERY happy to read from fellow yelpers that we needed to make sure to get there early (even though they close at 1, they stop seating earlier).  There wasn't a wait - and the super cute, adorable and friendly Japanese waitress seated us at a cozy table for two.  This was my fiance's first experience at a true ramen shop (his prior experience had led him to believe ramen only came in the form of freeze dried packages with sodium packs).  I was soo stoked to school him on ramen.\n\nWe ordered a spicy tuna roll to start, and I ordered him the pork miso ramen.  For me?  Spicy Pork Shoyu Ramen.   Service was fast, friendly, and our orders were up in no time at all!  It was probably one of our best meals in San Francisco.  The roll was delicious, but the soup was what really melted us.  The miso ramen was full of flavor, and the spicy shoyu was by far the best of what we ordered.  It was spicy for my fiance (perfect for me - I probably could've used more spice) but I was able to add pepper to it.   So much flavor without being too salty.  Flavorful broth - you could taste the meat in the broth, kind of like a pho noodle soup where the broth is what makes the soup. Everything else is just fluff.  We never felt like we we had MSG headache or that greasy feeling on your lips after consuming broth made from pork or chicken.  The noodles were fresh, and to reiterate - the meal itself was pure comfort - especially on a cold windy night in San Fran.\n\nPrices were reasonable we thought - about $9 for a bowl.

The tables are squishy in the small restaurant and its just very awkward coz you can pretty much hear the conversations of tables sitting next to you. They made us decide really quickly and order once we sat down, and the WORST PART, rushing us to pay the bill once we're semi-done (due to the long line waiting outside) We had just put down our chopsticks and 2 seconds later the waiter brought the check without asking (i was still considering in getting dessert at that time.....guess not!)\n\nI ordered the basic shoyu ramen and i was sadly, not impressed. The The ramen noodles were not chewy at all, and the broth was just average.\n\nOverall....the experience was quite disappointing.

After a night of drinking too much wine at District and sangria at Mochica I was on the verge of puking my brains out.  Fortunately, Katana-Ya is open late for the after party crowd that migrate over from Slide and Ruby Skye.  Even though I wasn't able to eat all of my Chicken Karaage Miso Ramen, the light broth of my Miso soup kept me from hurling my Peruvian dinner.   \n\nKatana-Ya is not only a late night spot, but it's a hot spot during the day as well.  Only a block away from Union Square, it's a great place to take a break from shopping or sightseeing.  We make our way to Katana-Ya anytime we're in the area.  The Chicken Karaage Miso Ramen is one of my favorites, but this is only one of the many dishes that make this place great.  They provide a nice portion of Cha-shu and the Ramen noodles are consistent...not quite firm and not too soft.  The great thing about Katana-Ya is they give you an option between rich or light broth.  If you're not a fan of Santa Ramen's thick broth, you will probably enjoy Katana-Ya's light broth...clean and delicious. \n\nDon't get me wrong...this place is really good, but if you're in a hurry you may want to skip this place.  Katana-Ya has an average wait of 10-15 minutes.  If you see people waiting outside in the cold that means you have a decent wait ahead of you.  It's worth the wait...and once you chow down on their Ramen....you'll be glad you waited.  Two thumbs up and a fist bump goes to Katana-Ya.", "author": "Brian S."}

I'd also note that the non-ramen dishes are solid too. I often get one of the rice bowls (usually oyakyo don) and also some different rolls. The sushi here is awesome - I never see that many people order it, but it might be some of the best sushi for the price in the city, and definitely for the area. If you're feeling aggressive, I'd split a sushi roll, order a small ramen and also get a rice bowl.\n\nThe main downside to the place is a) how popular it is and b) how crowded it gets.

It seems like the previous 738 Reviews were onto something. I had a whiff of the Miso Ramen Soup, it smelled promising. I also had  the honor and luxury of sipping the Soy Ramen. I must say it was spicy, and it was good!!!!\n\nAlso, first impressions are a big thing in my book. The restaurant opened at 12:00PM. We arrived at 11:50AM.

Unfortunately (and fortunately) I couldn't make it all the way to San Mateo for Santa Ramen so I used yelp and found Katana-Ya.\n\nMy coworkers and I headed over to Katana-Ya (let's call it K-Ya for short?) after work. Typically, a line out the door means good and promising things. The place was cramped but I guess it was cozy. We still got good conversation in and it didn't disrupt our meal. \n\nSad to say this place was SO CLOSE to being my new mecca. They had 3 of my favorite things... ramen, sushi, AND shaved ice with condensed milk dessert. So, each of us ordered a big steaming bowl of ramen (even though it was sunny and 70 degrees out!). For a small appetizer we got tuna maki.\n\nThe sushi was a disappointment. Clearly this place is known for it's ramen. The tuna had bits of bone or cartilage in it and the rolls themselves were very small. Sad face.\n\nThen came the ramen. Hot, steaming bowls of love (ew, that sounded wrong?). All 4 ramens were absolutely delicious, flavorful and filling. There was an interesting texture to the noodles but I really liked it. Super chewy and fat! More to love. The only downside is that I wish the menus stated what ingredients came with each bowl of ramen because I was hella coveting my coworker's bowl which had a little bit of everything. I mean HELLA coveting, almost to the point where I was just in her bowl eating with her. Anyway, before the slurp-fest began, we all tried a taste of each other's ramen choices. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. My favorite was probably the fried chicken ramen.\n\nFor dessert we ordered both shaved ice desserts. Both were good, maybe a little too sweet, but pretty damn good. I think this place is terrific and I would definitely go again.

GROSS! Katana-ya keeps it simple and already has bowls of ramen put together. You can make it spicy for $1. That's the only way you can specialize it. I think if you do any subsitutions to your ramen at Katana-Ya, they charge you a substitution fee since their kitchen is so small.\n\nI had their corn butter ramen and was thinking I would get buttered corn with my ramen.

I admit Ramen Underground is also solid but after someone told me their broth was on the salty side I started to agree. After two years of passing by Katanaya on the 38, one drunken attempt to eat there but discouraged after an incredibly long line, I finally decided to try my luck again on a Thursday evening after work this past week. To my surprise, at 6pm it is virtually empty but by 6:30 it was starting to fill up but we still didn't have to wait for a table (I did, however, have to wait for my party to get there). \n\nWe sat down. Ordered the Katanaya ramen which is a combination of every topping possible. Great choice when indecisive. The fried dumpling, chashu, pork and egg are wonderful! What's even more awesome is that they allow you to choose density of broth -- light or regular. What??? Awesome. You also choose between miso, soy sauce or salt broth. I had light density miso.\n\nWhen the food came out in its monstrous bowl, I tried the broth first. Solid and good enough to drink the whole bowl. The ramen itself was a good texture and properly cooked as well. It's a big bowl and a lot of food for $12. I couldn't finish everything.\n\nThe only random thing I must mention is that I actually felt legitimately drunk on my way home, sans any alcohol. I must have had the worst case of food coma because I passed out solid on my way home and could not get up for the life of me. Damn you, MSG. Lol.\n\nI've decided I will only come back when I don't have to wait. Glad I finally came!", "author": "Jeanne C."}

In our dressed up outfits and opera like attitude we went in the search for a hole in the wall ramen place.  \n\nYou see, I had watched Ramen girl a few days prior and suddenly had a huge craving for Ramen.  I wanted to see the whole world in a bowl the way they movie explains Ramen to be.  Now this is Brittany Murphy so I understand her Ramen expertise may be questionable, but I believed everything she said in that movie.\n\nSo we went to Katana ya because other yelpers suggested that this place is one of the best.

You have to choose from a scale of fattyness and choose the filling and choose the broth.  I was not expecting that because that is not how things worked in Ramen girl.\n\nIt was a little fatty but really tasty.  I can't imagine anyone can finish that bowl.

I guess it's good that they're honest about it, but then it makes me think why do you need MSG if your ingredients were good.  I'm sure alot of restaurants have MSG but they just don't tell you. \n\nSo putting that aside, I went with the regular ramen and asked the waitress which flavor she recommended.  She recommended the miso, which I thought was too salty.  The soup didn't have the rich pork taste in it like I would expect.  I've had ramen in Japan and this was not even close in comparison.  And I'm confused with the 3 flavors - salt, soy sauce, miso.  Where's the regular pork flavored broth?   The bowl cost about $10 too which seems very pricey for just a regular bowl of ramen.\n\nI would definitely not go out of my way again to come here.

Just a little more meat & a bit bigger bowl overall would've completed the perfect feeling of satisfaction that this rich & flavorful soup offered with it's comforting deliciousness.

Im figuring that we just barely beat the crown because by the time we were seated there were about 20 people crowded outside, waiting for one of their 7 or so coveted tables.\n\nWe were seated in a cramped booth near the front window. This is why I take away one star...I understand that Katana-Ya is a hole-in-the-wall, I love the, \"We know we're great so why update anything,\" vibe. But, we were seated by an open door that led to a hallway holding kegs and what looked like some trash. This unappetizing view didnt discourage us because we already knew this place was a gem. But the other people in our party probably got a little freaked out. Nothing like a dirty sushi joint, ya know!\n\nThis time I ordered the Sashimi combo. 3 pieces of 4 kinds of fish (12 total) with miso soup to start. My bf again ordered the chirashi bowl and it was even better than I remembered. All cuts if fish were thick, not at all skimpy. Nice thick cuts of perfectly fresh fish, not even the slightest feeling of  \"hmm-maybe-this-wasnt-such-a-good-idea,\" that I sometimes get when trying out a new sushi restaurant.\n\nThe rest of the table ordered, what they described as, \"the best fried rice they've ever had,\" as well as a Philly roll and the Golden Roll, to which they added eel.

Well, I had to make do...\n\nWe got a dynamite roll, which is a mix of spicy fish.  Indeed, it was spicy... no wasabi needed unless you want more of a kick.  The fish tasted pretty fresh.  Although the roll was very simple, no sauces or anything, it was very good.  It cost $6 for 6 pieces.  Decently priced.  THeir other special rolls range from $11-13.50.\n\nWe also got their Katanaya ramen bowls.  What's nice about the ramen bowls is that you can choose the flavor of the broth:  soy, miso, regular and rich or light.  We got different broth flavors but same content.  I got the rich miso broth, and my friend got the rich soy broth.  I have to admit, I liked the soy broth better.  I kind of got sick of my miso broth.  It was very filling... I couldn't finish my bowl of ramen!  It comes with A LOT... The Katanaya ramen comes with 2 fried dumpling pieces, 2-3 pieces of fried chicken (no bone), and pieces of bbq pork or chasu.  The fried chicken tasted really good, but I like the bbq pork better.  The bbq pork was really soft and had a good flavor.  I wasn't too big of a fan of the fried dumpling... kind of had a weird taste.

The first good sign was that they led their menu with the ramen and didn't overdo it with too many types of ramen either. Admittedly, the sushi bar would suggest that the sushi here is the star, but we'll save that for another trip.\n\nI decided on an order of Katanaya Ramen, which I assume would be their specialty if it had the name in there. You choose your own base (another good sign) of soy sauce, salt, or miso, as well. The Katanaya Ramen is a rather large bowl of ramen (and costs accordingly, coming in at around $12) with noodles plus fried chicken and some deep fried gyoza in the bowl. Yes please!\n\nMost people are often tricked by the actual ramen noodles though, if they get enough extras in their bowl. But luckily, the ramen was well done, the miso broth was great as well. Any bowl that has you continually sipping at it when the noodles are long gone is a good one, and this is what I did.\n\nUnfortunately for this place, it's easy to miss because it's a rather unobvious store front, but I'm going to add it to my ramen rotation when I'm in the Union Square area. Tanpopo still wins because of it's location in J-town and much easier parking, but the places tie when it comes when to ramen and the service (great staff at both places).", "author": "Roland C."}

It seemed like the staff were all Japanese-- the sushi chef had some kind of accent, but was speaking Japanese just fine. \n\nWe waited about 10 minutes. My sister and I are both big fans of ramen so we had a hard time choosing.

It's not very spicy, and it's only when you hit the little bits of chili pepper that it has a little bit of a kick. I loved the bamboo shoots in there! Very tasty.\n\nMy sister's kimchi ramen: It wasn't too spicy like some kimchi ramens I've had. It had a very good kimchi flavor to it that was more than subtle, yet not nearly overwhelming. \n\nBoth ramens had a couple nice thick chashu pieces (pork), which weren't fatty at all, which we appreciated.

This place was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is also into Ramen.\n\nWhen we got there (about 7pm on a thurs) there was a bunch of folks standing outside (prob about 8).  Like another great ramen joint (down in LA), they had a clipboard outside where you put your name down.  We waited about 10 minutes (which is not bad) and got a seat at the sushi bar.  \n\nThe inside is nothing special.  It should be noted though that the place can prob only fit like 40 ppl.  The tables are stacked together pretty closely so expect to be elbow to elbow with ramen lovers (which is perfectly fine in my book).  Although the place was packed it wasn't loud and as a matter of fact it was pretty chill.  Pefect place for a date in my opinion.  \n\nAs far as the food is concerned, we were only here for one thing...Ramen.  They had other stuff on the menu but I didn't concern myself with that.  I ordered the Pork Ramen with Soy Sauce and my wife ordered the Pork Ramen with Miso.\n\nThe wait was pretty quick, prob less than 15 minutes which is good at peak time.  The noodles were perfect (al dente).  The soy sauce base however was okay. Middle of the pack if I compare it to some other places that I've been to.  The soy sauce flavor seemed to be on the lite site.  I was expecting this burst of flavor when I sipped the broth but it never came.  The Pork was also okay, I prefer the BBQ Pork at other places that has a little crisp to it.  If you're looking for crisp in the Pork you're not getting it here.  Overall though I enjoyed the combination of flavor.  I also tried my wife's ramen (with miso base) and I seemed to like that one much better.  The flavor in the broth was more present and it seemed to provide a creamyness to the noodles.\n\nOverall I liked the ambiance of the place...small elbow to elbow and several different ramen choices.

I guess yelp is a place where you can really over-hype a place that is just consistently okay. I'm sorry but I really didn't see anything special about this place. Maybe because it's known for ramen specifically? (as opposed to other japanese restaurants who may have ramen on their menu but not as it's *MAIN* thing?)

The menu features sushi, donburi plates, appetizers, and their famed ramen. The \"meat\" broth choices are soy sauce (shoyu), miso, or salt (shio).

Additionally, you can specify spiciness (additional charge). \n\nI ordered shio, light, and mildly spicy. I liked that the broth was thin and drinkable and found it very tasty, with an addictive kick. My friends tell me the regular spicy here is extremely spicy, with a layer of chili oil on top.\n\nI went for the Katanaya special, which included two tasty kara-age, two gyoza (ok), two slices of pork (a little tough), a lone bamboo shoot, seaweed, half a hardboiled egg, and plenty of corn. The deep fried chicken was my favorite topping, but I wished they would put the fried items on a separate plate, to keep them from turning mushy. The texture of the gyoza suffered noticeably from being added to the soup. I didn't specify noodle doneness but they came out with a medium firmness and stayed fairly firm throughout eating.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the bowl of ramen I had here, albeit expensive.

My friend and I loved the noodle combination where you can choose between either their famous ramen, udon or soba....and pair it with various dishes (mostly rice dishes). I had the udon paired with salmon sashimi over rice and it was absolutely delicious. The udon was had a very good texture and the broth was flavorful. My friend's ramen and oyako-don were also excellent. \n\nThey're super friendly and make sure your water is always filled.

So after you've been savaged by a rogue dessert wine bottle, where do you want to go to lick your wounds?  The chummy little counter at Katana-ya hits the spot: friendly, quick, & you'll be so busy slurping up steaming hot ramen you'll forget all about that big fat bandage on your hand that makes people think you're wearing a maneki-neko costume.\n\nInjured hubby, from now on to be known as Capt Hook, got the light miso broth BBQ pork ramen.  Can't imagine what the \"rich\" broth tastes like because this was pushing the oily factor, otherwise well seasoned without too much salt.  Delicious slightly chewy ramen [slurp!] with some greens to help cut through the impending food coma.  Since it was comfort food night, also got the katsudon which was just as it should be: breaded pork cutlet with green onions &savory egg custard over steaming rice & pickled ginger on the side to give your tastes buds a jolt every once in a while.  Just what a homesick tummy ordered.  Oh, & they have sweet potato shochu (imojochu) for any intestinal deglazing needs!\n\nLike most places around here it's a small footprint but comes off cozy.

This year, I'm going to make a resolution I know I can keep and that's to conquer that list of 100 things you should eat in SF before you die. Although some have already been visited by chance, luck, and word of mouth, the quest begins with Katana-Ya. \n\nIn all honesty, Katana-Ya was probably more of a 3.75 stars. I gave it the 4 stars for innovation and pairing uni with ramen. WTF? I've never had that before. \n\nThe Setting: Small, cozy. Felt authentic.  Reminded me of the yakkatori strip on st. marks in NYC where pleasant memories were formed with pitchers of beer or one of the yakkitori bars in Japan. So 4 stars for the hole in the wall. \n\nThe Service: Gave it a 3. The food came out slightly slower than hoped and I got ignored for tea refills by our waitress in a pretty much empty shop. To me, crappy service doesn't  bother me unless servers are pretentious a-holes or they lie about the integrity of what they serve. \n\nThe food: Gave the ramen a 3 stars. I liked it but the ramen was tough in texture and lacking that bite of freshness that you taste when you eat fresh noodles. I actually preferred the miso broth over the soy sauce broth because it complemented the ramen better in my opinion. The soy sauce broth was really salty. \n\nThe toppings on the ramen consisting of pork, fried chicken, corn, and potstickers really pushed the food worthy of 3.5 stars.  The bowl really was a melting pot of all comforts that I grew up with and eating them brought back fond memories. It is my belief that food is deemed good if it can bring you back to a happy time in your life. The toppings epitomized what comfort food should feel and taste like. \n\nWhat tipped it to a 4 stars was the use of uni and ikura don to complement my bowl of ramen. I was really wowed. the uni was pretty fresh and sweet to my surprise. I mean what kind of nigiri should i expect from a mom and pop ramen shop? The toro disappointed but the uni exceeded my expectations as well as my bowel half filled with ikura (a very healthy portion). \n\nConclusion: On a night exhausted by drinking and dancing or a 40 degree rainy day in San Francisco, I'd definitely come to Katana-Ya for a feel of comfort.", "author": "Wendy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-14", "description": "There are two kinds of ramen: good ramen and booty ramen. Good ramen has some bite to it.  Dense.  Al dente.  It's also usually accompanied with several choices of broth (i.e. miso, shoyu, or shiro).  The broth is usually very rich, cloudy, and complex.  Good ramen is also usually served by an all Japanese wait staff.  Not that I believe for a second that in order to be fantastic, cuisine must be prepared and served by the people of its origin.  But I've never had good ramen served by anybody who wasn't Japanese.  So far, that's just the way it's been.  And it doesn't have to be expensive either.\n\nThen there's booty ramen.  You may be thinking, \"What's wrong with booty?  I love booty!\"  But nobody likes ramen that tastes like booty.  Curly instant noodles, so light they're almost fluffy.  Broth that tastes like it came out of a packet.  Strange flavors that shouldn't be there.  And it's  usually served by Chinese people.  Not that I believe that Chinese people can't serve up a decent bowl of ramen.  So far, that's just the way it's been.\n\nKatana-Ya serves good ramen.  I came here the other night for the first time.  It was a Friday night, and the wait kinda long.  The tables are tiny, and the dining area is small.  But it was still worth it.  Albeit with a few drawbacks.\n\nI ordered the pork ramen with miso broth.  While the noodles and the broth were great, I wish there was more pork.  Two thin slices don't cut it.  My girlfriend has the chicken karage ramen.  5 chunks of savory, golden, deep fried chicken will make just about anything taste better.\n\nThen there's the issue with eggs.  I ordered a hard-boiled egg.  My girlfriend ordered a hard-boiled egg.  My other friend didn't want an egg.  Somehow I got an egg, my girlfriend got two eggs, and my friend also got an egg.  Our waitress laughed and said she didn't know what happened,  which was totally cool since they didn't charge us four eggs.  And while the eggs were perfectly cooked (the yolk was a consistent yellow from the surface through the center), they were cold, most likely precooked and stored in the fridge and plopped in to order.  The inconsistency in temperature was a bit disappointing.\n\nNevertheless, this is still good ramen.  And while I haven't found that many places that serve good ramen in the Bay Area, the fact that Katana-Ya serves good ramen by Union Square, and is open 'til 1:15 is a blessing.  If you're in the area, or simply want to try some good ramen, order up a bowl at Katana-Ya.  If you want booty ramen, try Genki Ramen.", "author": "Tony L."}

After being seated the menu exploration began. Rule of thumb, when looking for the best dish in the house order the one with the restaurants name on it (then ask the server). \n\nThe Katanya ramen was basically of combination of most of the ramens. It included fried chicken (really good), 2 gyoza's (OK), seaweed, bamboo shoots, 2 slices of pork, (OK), half an egg, scallions, and corn (yummy). As suggested by the server the miso base was the way to go (choice of salt, miso, and I cant remember the last). The ramen itself was tender and delicious however the soup base could have been better. The bamboo overpowered the miso and became almost too \"mustybambooish\" its a real word I swear. \n\nAs usual my eyes are significantly larger than my stomach so we decided to order the Alaskan sushi roll (shrimp tempura with yellow tail and avocado) as well. The roll was pretty good a 4 out of 5 star. Fresh, good rice to fish and shrimp ratio. Overall would order again. \n\nSo, the recommendation is if you order the ramen I would go with the fried chicken ramen. From what I can tell the sushi is pretty good too. Not the best date place because of the wait and difficult street parking (expensive garage near by cab it if you can), but on a rainy day with a small party of 4 or less this is a good destination for major carbs.", "author": "Howard C."}

Because that's what Japanese people do, RIGHT?!?  While, of course, slurping down some delicious ramen since I'm a multi-tasker.\n\nSo after some dude has slipped me the sausage -- after, that is, he's removed the gag from my mouth and untied the grosgrain ribbons that were binding my limbs --  I like to stumble down the hill at 11.30 pm, slide past the sketch, and walk into this tiny, narrow space with mirrors on the walls and a sweet staff of Japanese speakers.\n\nI usually get the pork ramen in rich miso broth, though I also love the chicken karaage ramen in the same broth.  In both cases, the ramen has always been firm and chewy, the broth salty, and my angry, desperate soul comforted.  If I'm feeling like a real glutton, I'll get a noodle donburi combo and pair my ramen with a serving of curry rice.\n\nBecause I -- err I mean, we -- like curry, too.\n\n4.5 stars", "author": "d s."}

We paid $13 for their signature ramen which comes with 2 chashu,  one egg, 2 potsticker, & 2 chicken karage. I ordered the veggie ramen, which I liked but for $11 bucks?! The LA one has combos, 11-15 bucks (depending on what side you order) comes with Ramen & either sashimi over rice, pork belly over rice, & someothers which I forgot.

The small restaurant is kind of hidden and nestled in a busy block next to a Quizno's, but it isn't difficult to find.  What may be difficult is getting a table, as the restaurant seats no more than maybe 24 people comfortably and was packed during the lunch hour.  \n\nWe all ordered the Lunch Combination (priced between $10-12) which is a bowl of ramen, complete with all the fixings including a slice of pork, seaweed and bamboo shoots, and a side donburi of your choice.  My choice?  Tomago don, it was perfectly egg-y with the right amount of sauce.  But the Kimchee don was pretty darn perfect too.   \n\nLike most Japanese restaurants, sushi is also served here.  But I recommend the ramen seeing how it's their specialty.  You have the option of three different broth flavors,.. shoyu, miso or salt.  And then whether you want it rich or light.  I went for miso light which was more than fatty enough for me.  But Alvin O. (with his amazing metabolism) ordered a miso rich.  I think he summed it up best when we finished our meals, \"Dude, you know it's hella fatty when you don't even need Chapstick after you're done eating.\"  Haha eww, but so yummy and satisfying at the same time.  \n\nI know my arteries probably weren't happy with me, but my tummy sure was!

I'm actually not a fan of all their other ramens cause I feel it's \"just a bunch of toppings\" thrown in together.\n\nThe size of their restaurant is both their draw and their setback.

The miso chashu (BBQ Pork) ramen was absolutely heavenly. When they closed a few years ago I was really sad and I haven't had a bowl ramen that could compare to it since (and believe me, I've been looking).\n\nEnter San Francisco's Katana-ya. I have no idea if they are related to my fabled San Jose favorite (and neither did the waitress), but after reading Ed and Nobu's reviews a couple weeks ago, it immediately shot to the top of my priority list, and I've been craving it ever since. With all these five-star reviews, I just had see what it was all about.\n\nAfter trekking over from the Conan O'Brien taping at the Orpheum, we arrived to an empty restaurant at around 5:30pm for an early dinner. We started with the Homemade King Crab Croquette and an order of Chicken Karaage. The croquettes were great; they were light and perfectly fried and paired with a side dish of katsu sauce...and I really love me some katsu sauce. The karaage was good but not great, and honestly, I've never found a karaage that I thought was completely satisfying. Well, a squeeze of lemon helped a lot, and so did dipping them in the katsu sauce!\n\nI ordered my usual miso chashu ramen and my wife ordered the shoyu ramen. My ramen was really good, but it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the pork was great.

I wake up in the morning craving the thin slices of tender pork and the perfectly cooked noodles.  I even did research on the art and science of cooking my own authentic ramen (not easy).  You inspire me, KY.  \n\nThe place is tiny so you may find yourself waiting in the non-existent waiting area especially on weekend nights.  And service is truthfully not all that great.

The chicken karaage (deep fried chicken) is very tasty (this still strikes me as very weird), but I still prefer my traditional chaashuu (bbq pork) ramen with miso base.\n\nOccasionally, the noodle are slightly undercooked, so I just let them soak in the hot broth a little longer, and that usually amends the issue.  I have recently learned that you could ask for a \"kaedama\" service, meaning additional boiled noodles in your remaining broth.  I have yet to try this.\n\nI have also tried their oyakodon (chicken and egg over rice) and curry rice.  The chicken from the oyakodon was extremely dry, and some pieces of beef in the curry rice were cold.  In either case, I don't recommend ordering anything other than ramen.

Easily the best in the city.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect in this quirky teeny tiny hole-in-the-wall off of tourist trap Union Square, sandwiched between such quality (sarcasm, for the dense) eats as Jack in the Crack and King of Thai noodle. The interior looks a little shabby, but in a well loved pair of jeans that you've worn so many times that it's faded and slightly fringed kind of way. :P I noticed a cute owl motif. There was a drawing of an owl posted on the window, and I noticed the same owl drawn on the walls in the bathroom. They were playing reggae music, which sounds odd, but strangely enough, fits with the whole feel of the place.\n\nThe ramen comes in rich or light broth, with a choice of miso, shoyu, or salt. I went with the rich (always go for rich with ramen) shoyu. The boyfriend had rich miso. We both went for chashyu, but there were other viable options such as kim chee and chicken karaage.\n\nThe broth was excellent, filled with little chunks of flavorings, such as garlic and green onions. You know it's awesome when there's that yummy layer of oil, heh. It was full of flavor, as ramen broth should be, and totally \"sippable\" as my friend and fellow ramen connoisseur Horace K. would say.\n\nThe noodles were a perfect thickness and had the right chewiness. It reminds me of Santa Ramen's noodles.\n\nThe chashyu I wasn't as much of a fan of. I like my chashyu juicy and slightly fatty. (I know, oink oink.) The chasyu here is very lean, and a little drier than I'd like.\n\nService was fast and attentive. The waitress was very nice, and the food came out really quickly.\n\nThere was a very wide variety in the menu, not just ramen. I'm definitely going to go back and try more things.\n\nEdit:\n\nOn a return trip, I found out the difference between light and rich broth is what they use as the base. Light = chicken. Rich = pork. Having tried both, I can't say there's that much of a difference, but I do prefer the rich broth more. Oh, and the chicken karaage was very good. :)", "author": "Bekki J."}

I've been looking for good ramen in SF and haven't had much luck over the years but the meal I had here could very possibly be the start of a beautiful friendship. (Thanks for the heads-up, Wakako U!)\n\nUnassuming from the outside, I've probably walked by Katana-ya a dozen times without noticing the tell-tale Japanese red fabric awning with the Japanese word \"ramen\" right there! \n\nHuh? Wha? Where'djucomefrom??\n\nWalked in and the first thing I saw was a marker board full of curly-casual Japanese handwriting with today's specials. Yep. Just like they do in Japan. This looks promising...\n\nGlanced over the varied menu but I was on a mission for ramen so went straight to the chashyu (bbq pork) ramen in shiyo (salt) broth. Oh... and a side order of homemade gyoza since I was famished. Um... and a small Sapporo since I was thirsty. Perfect. The place wasn't too crowded on a Monday at 9:30pm so it took no more than 10 minutes for my meal to arrive. Now mind you, this was going to be my second bowl of noodles for the day (I had pho for lunch) but when I'm craving noodles, I'm CRAVING NOODLES and my attempt at noodle salvation earlier in the day was a serious letdown. I was not content and neither were my taste buds. So here I was, just 8 hours later at a different venue kicking off round two of the Jay Z \"noodle-off.\"\n\nUsually soups and broths from most places around town end up tasting somewhat bland to my palette, requiring the addition of whatever number of condiments, spices, herbs, and peppers to give my taste buds a kickstart but not this time.  The bowl smelled of light but flavorful hot broth with just the right amount of savory goodness (I want to say 'koubashi-sa') and salty kick - I was ready to eat! First slurp of soup, yum. First slurp and bite of noodle, yesssss. Ramen should have some 'bite' and texture (what the Italians call al dente) and shouldn't ever be pasty, starchy, gummy or slimy and Katana-ya delivered. The chashyu was rich with flavor as were the few slices of bamboo shoots that I lapped up.\n\nI think this is my favorite ramen in San Francisco by far. And I've kept an eye out for decent ramen since moving here almost 10 years ago. I just didn't realize it would be so difficult. Only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars was the slightly disappointing gyoza, which although certainly looked homemade, tasted a bit too much of freshly chopped garlic. Don't get me wrong, I love garlic as much as the next guy but there's a savoriness (yes, I love that word) to food that comes from adding just the right amount of heated garlic that can't be beat. Unfortunately the taste of this gyoza was overpowered by the sheer raw-ness of garlic as if the flavors hadn't fused together in the mixture quite yet.  I'll give it another try it next time - hopefully it was just this batch.\n\nSo... yes, I finished every last drop of that bowl of shiyo ramen. The bottom of the bowl stared back at me and I grinned, totally satiated. \n\nAnd what of that bowl of pho from lunchtime? Oh, that was so \"earlier-this-afternoon\" it wasn't even in the same league.", "author": "Jay Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-10-08", "description": "(This review is for the ramen only.)\r\n\r\nYet another mediocre ramen joint in the city. I think people who post on Yelp have a bad habit of handicapping their ratings to the tune of \"not bad for San Francisco/Bay Area\" because of the relative lameness of most restaurants that serve up ramen here (It's either that or they have no clue about what good ramen should be).\r\n\r\nWell, screw that I say. Mediocre food doesn't deserve accolades.\r\n\r\nTried the shio (assari/light), shoyu (assari), shio (kotteri/heavy) broths in a negi ramen version.\r\n\r\nFirst, the soup. While I could appreciate the tonkotsu base, the soup was oily in a bad way in both the assari and kotteri versions of the soup. While tonkotsu style broth is usually pretty hearty in nature, I think the kitchen is trying to use fat to compensate for flavor. There was essentially an oil slick on the top of the ramen.\r\n\r\nI felt the shoyu soup tasted better than the shio soup, which I found to be really salty. Yes, ramen ain't supposed to be health food, but I thought the sodium content of the shio soup to be over the top.\r\n\r\nNext, the noodles. Garden variety egg noodles. A little over al dente, which made the noodles a bit mushy. Maybe you can ask the waitstaff to have your noodles cooked so that it's harder.\r\n\r\nLastly, the fixin's. Regulation issue char-siu, thinly sliced. No menma, just some wakame. WTF is up with that? And the negi. Let me tell ya, that really put the last nail on the coffin for me.\r\n\r\nI've eaten negi ramen in various parts of Japan (Kanto, Kansai, Kyushu), and the negi here at Katanaya sucked hard. Their idea of spicy negi was flaccid, flabby green onions sliced at about one inch intervals perpendicular to its length and tossed with what seemed like a mixture of sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, and/or sriracha.\r\n\r\nA proper execution of negi ramen should have the white, thick cylindrical part of the negi cut obliquely across it's length to form long slices of concentric circles. The resulting negi should be tossed in some type of dressing, typically containing sesame oil (or chili sesame oil/la-yu) and some type of red chili preparation. The resulting freshly prepared negi topping should be placed on top of the ramen and NEVER cooked with it so that it retains its crisp, oniony, spicy goodness.\r\n\r\nOkay, rant over.\r\n\r\nService was otherwise perfunctory. A young, genial Japanese guy tried his best to be \"genki.\" Nice chap. There was also a young Japanese waitress who helped the young guy at the end, but she was obviously at the end of her shift and couldn't give a rats ass about mustering up even a fake smile. Kind of threw us the check and gave us our change.\r\n\r\nIf I were to handicap this place, it's just hunky-dory for hipster folk who just care about chowing down some fatty, salty food after a night of binge drinking in the 'Loin or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nHell, if you're drunk, your taste buds will be dead anyway so you might as well score some \"gourmet\" burgers at Jack in the Box (mmm Ciabatta Burgers!) just around the corner or a steaming bowl of Thai beef soup noodles at King of Thai Noodles next door.", "author": "Bono B."}

Guess the person taking the order did not get my order right and just got the fried chicken ramen, which had a miso soup base, and yes it was yummy. I had asked for a medium spice. I actually had to reorder my ramen, which was good. Giving it 5 stars cos of the flavors. Will surely come here again.", "author": "Deepti R."}

But, boy, does this place serves up some seriously good and piping hot ramen noodles or what?  Mine was a regular, rich soy broth, for $6.50 a bowl.  There's the option of ordering the ramen with choice of a side for only a few dollars more.  \n\nMy friend (who recommended this place to me) and I decided to share some sushi rolls and appetizer, on top of a bowl of ramen each.  We had the Alaska Roll ($5.50), Spicy Hamachi Roll ($6.00) and Agedashi Tofu appetizer ($5.00).  The sushi certainly did not disappoint - the rolls were artfully presented and the fish tasted really fresh.  As to the agedashi tofu, the texture of the batter paired with the softness in the center of the tofu was just about perfect.  \n\nBottom Line:  Fantastic place.

It's conveniently located right next to Union Square, so it was also near my hotel.  I stopped in with some friends and ordered a small assortment of nigiri sushi, as well as some fatty tuna sashimi, and a big bowl of ramen to share.\n\nBoth the nigiri and sashimi were wonderful - the fish was succulent, fresh, and melted in my mouth.  The flavor was spot-on, and I ventured to try some new cuts of fish.  The ramen was filling, with the full assortment of tasty additions you'd expect to find in your good ramen shop.\n\nThough a bit pricey for what you get, and very limited on space, this is definitely a good ramen restaurant to go to.

Granted, I also still haven't tried the ramen here, which, according to Mellie P., is pretty good for ramen outside of Japan. \n\nCame here on a Sunday for lunch with a friend, where we had to wait outside for a little bit since there was a waiting list. Ran into a student from my school, and I think I also spotted Nobu K. (!) but I felt too shy to say anything (it was like seeing a celebrity, really!). Anyway, once my friend and I were inside, service was no-nonsense. Got our menus, when we were ready to order the server came over immediately. Our food was served probably ten minutes after we ordered (pretty fast), and our bill was given to us when we needed it right away.\n\nGood, quick service. A nice place to come for a semi-quick bite off of Union Square. \n\nIn terms of the food: Well, this time I ordered the Tamago Don and shared the Lava Flow Roll with my friend. I would have opted for the Katana-Ya Ramen, but I was still kind of full from a late breakfast, so a rice bowl seemed like the best choice for me at the moment. Tamago Don was tasty, not too salty. The Lava Flow Roll was supposed to be one of the spicy rolls, but....where was the spice?! I felt it was rather mild and was disappointed that there wasn't more spice. Then again, maybe my standards for spice has been shooting through the roof more since I sprinkle cayenne pepper on everything these days (well, on my omelets and on my buttered toast anyway). \n\nThe desserts looked tasty; they had the pictures pasted on the mirrored walls and I kept eyeing the red-bean green tea mochi ice cream picture. It even had a smiley face! How could one resist a dessert with a smiley face? =P\n\nI'll still consider Katana-Ya one of the Japanese restaurants that serve more authentic cuisine, though--no doubt in that. Next time, I will really try the ramen, since it seems the ramen gets more raves than anything else...\n\n(Oh, and yes, the prices are fairly reasonable, at least for donburi and ramen. Some of the sushi roll prices were a little exorbitant though.)", "author": "Helene K."}

The bad: average rolls, salty edamame, somewhat pricey.  \n\nI'll start with the main event: the BBQ pork ramen ( # 5 on the 7x7 Big Eat SF list, see http://www.7x7.com/content/eat-drink/big-eat-sf-100-things-try-you-die) was my introduction to restaurant ramen in San Francisco (I'm more familiar with ramen shops in NYC). I ordered it with mildly spicy rich salt broth; the broth was pleasingly savory and rich and had enough kick to satisfy without overpowering one's palette. I also enjoyed the springy and tender noodles. However, I was disappointed with the skimpy portions and the provision of a mere three slices of pork and a modest sprinkle of green onions and seaweed. Plus, why charge an extra $.50 to make it spicy? I don't get it. Overall, the ramen was good, but not great. My pursuit of excellent ramen in the Bay Area continues! (any suggestions?)\n\nBack to the rest of the meal:\n\nSake: The sake menu is impressive and comes complete with pictures and succinct descriptions. The unfiltered Junmai did not disappoint - it was fragrant and sweet with just the right amount of alcohol. \n\nAppetizers: The gyoza was crispy on the outside, but I found the filling a bit too mushy. The edamame was excessively salty - probably the saltiest edamame I've ever had and too salty to finish.\n\nRolls: We got the baked salmon, shrimp tempura, and caterpillar rolls. Overall, I agree with Jennifer R: the rolls were overpriced and average. But I should note that the baked salmon roll, which came with a piping hot baked salmon center surrounded by sticky rice and an egg wrap, was tasty and somewhat unique. \n\nRandom observations: Street parking is nearly impossible. The restaurant is open until 1:15 am on most nights, which is later than most places. Lastly, you should check out the bathroom mural art - kind of funny and creepy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-27", "description": "One word. OVERRATED.\n\nJust because this restaurant has been on the 7x7 list for some time doesn't make it that great.\n\nI'll put things into perspective.\n\nFirst of all, this was one of the early ramen houses in San Francisco. The ramen crazy exploded in 2005 or so in the Bay Area when ramen house after ramen house sprang up. I heard of Katana Ya by 2007, but it wasn't a big thing til the 7x7 list.\n\nIf you know the South Bay, you know the demographics. There's a huge Japanese population. It's just like why the best Dim Sum will be close to SF or Oakland and not in the South Bay. That's why some of the best ramen houses are down there. Santouka, Halu, Orenchi, just to name a few. There's other ones that are at least mediocre.\n\nWhen I first heard of this Katana Ya being on some godly 7x7 list I expected the best. I just came from weekly trips to Santouka and Santa, so I decided to line up with my gf for Katana Ya.\n\nWas it worth the 2 hours? No way. This place ranks mediocre at best. BTW, I'm not taking points off for the wait. This is solely about the food.\n\nA ramen place is all about the broth. This goes with other specialty noodles like pho. Ramen broth is supposed to be thick, greasy, and filled with flavor. This is NOT the case with Katana Ya.  I tried the Miso while my gf tried the salt. I also tried the soy on another day on my own. I feel like the broth here is very bland and the attempts at spicy broths or extra salty broths are just to cover up the lack of flavor. Spicy broths aren't even very authentic Japanese. Kim Chi? Are you kidding me? Usually on a cold day you should be able to sit in front of a bowl of ramen and just take one spoonful of broth before feeling satisfied. That one spoonful should have so much flavor it arouses all your senses and gets your stomach growling with hunger. It never came close to this at Katana Ya sadly enough.\n\nI thought tossing fried chicken into ramen is just excessive too. It's not really what Japanese ramen is. To me it's more a desperation attempt to get more flavor in the noodles/broth than anything else. I see it as trying too hard to give some character in the ramen because it isn't great as ramen alone.\n\nCompare this place to other famous ramen shops like Santouka, Santa, Halu, and you will see that the other 3 places have very thick and rich broths. Katana ya feels very plain. Compare this to other places like even the mediocre Kagetsu Arashi from Japan or Daikokuya from LA and Katana Ya completely pales.\n\nI honestly think that people have hyped this place to beyond appropriateness. I'm not saying it should be off the 7x7 list, but even if this is the best the city has to offer in terms of Japanese ramen, let's not act like this is mecca of ramen in the Bay Area. There's far better places.\n\nThe Ramen Queen Melanie Wong at Chowhound has put Katana Ya at #21 in this list (scroll down a bit):\nhttp://chowhound.chow.com/topics/681436\n\nFor someone who's tried 15-20 ramen places too and in an in depth manner, I'd like to say that Katana Ya ranks somewhere on the bottom half of my list. It's a notch above Maru Ichi or Ryowa in my opinion, but can't touch Orenchi, Santouka, Santa, Halu, Kahoo, Ajisen. BTW please don't mix up the legendary Halu of San Jose with the terrible Halu in San Francisco.\n\nOnce again I emphasize my motto: perspective. Look at the South Bay ramen places. Those are the places you really want to go to. Santa isn't in the south bay, but it's truly a wonderful place too. I feel like San Franciscans are too wrapped up in their bubble of the 7x7 list and too amazed by a mediocre ramen shop that this place has exploded to way too many Yelp stars.\n\nIf you haven't had good ramen before and only had Top Ramen, this might be paradise, but if you know what Japanese ramen is, head elsewhere.", "author": "Dennis M."}

Ramen is the ultimate comfort food and my spicy tofu ramen at Katana-Ya definitely hit the spot. \n\nWe came here for lunch on a Friday and beat the lunchtime rush... thank goodness because it is a small restaurant and fills up fast. The menu is extensive and everything looked really good but we ended up getting Spicy Tofu Ramen in light miso, Chasu Ramen in rich miso, and a California roll. All REALLY good. The broth was all done perfectly with the right amount of ramen (very plentiful) and tofu and pork. Soooooo satisfying. \n\nAs for our roll, all the sushi looked too good to pass up so we decided to go with something small which was a good ol' California roll. It was freakin good!!!

I can say, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of ramen.  I have even been known to settle for sub-par ramen when there is no alternative... but happily, this was not the case with Katana-Ya.\n\nThis place was actually pretty good!  Sure, its a little small and dingy, but hey... so are many of the best ramen places in Japan, right?  I'm not  gonna go elitist here... look, Ramen in Japan  is wonderful, but it's unfair to make direct comparisons to their American counterparts.  I'm sure there is some place in Shibuya that has mouth watering cha-shu, blah blah blah...  Sure... we all know that... But we are here in the bay area, so we need to scale our critiques.\n\nThat being said:\n\nNoodles:  Chewy and springy.  Cooked slightly Al Dente as it should be.  Great texture, and perfect egg-noodle flavor.\n\nRich Shoyu Broth: (there are other options, but i haven't tried them yet)\nA little on the salty side, but definitely tolerable, and still in the delicious range.  Good flavor, and not overpowered by the negi.\n\nCha Shu: not too soggy, and virtually melts in your mouth.  Not the best I have ever had, but it was damn good.\n\nTea:  Who cares... you came for the noodles right? ^_^\n\nSummary:  Hands down the best ramen place in down town SF.  I work here in the city, so its very convenient for me.  I wouldn't come to San Francisco specifically for this though.  I would just say, its great ramen done right  in an area that has few other options for ramen.\n\nNOTE:  If you are looking for the best ramen in the bay area... do your self a favor and head on over to Santa Ramen in San Mateo... I know you have heard of it.  But if you happen to be in the downtown area, Katana-Ya is a solid recommendation.\n\n\"Itadakimasu\"\n\n~ E\n\n\n*** UPDATE ***\nWent back and tried the (Rich) Miso broth, Cha-shu ramen\nReally Good!

A few days ago my girlfriend had come to visit me from the south bay and we were of course.. hungry! \n\nIt was a really rainy day which means I needed a good broth to get me through the cold! But we're driving through SF and can't decide where to eat, so I tell my gf to open up her yelp app and pick some place that sounds like it fits the weather; 3 minutes later she points out Katana-Ya! The moment I heard it was ramen I immediately responded with \"directions. go!\" Within a few minutes we found out the locations, then looked for parking for another 10-15 minutes, ridiculous, but it's in SF! As we stepped up to the entrance we noticed a line, stood in it for a bit then realized there was a sign up sheet, duh! We stared at the menu for about 15 minutes, huddle under the canopy and stared at the menu; even after being seated we were still unsure what to get, everything sounded so delicious and we were stuck on the combos; ramen with sashimi, ramen with curry, ramen with kastu?  Or even soba with katsu?! \n\nIn any case we felt bad because we asked the waitress for more time twice and remembered that there were other outside in the rain =X! I ordered the Katana-Ya special which pretty much came with meat they offered: chicken wings, chasu, pork and an egg in a miso broth plus a spicy tuna roll (because I love spicy tuna); and my gf got a regular ramen, salt flavored and combo'd it with a chicken katsu bowl. \n\nWithin 5-10 minutes we got both our bowls of ramen....weird..where's her katsu? Oh well, we dove, the aroma of the broth overwhelming me I started slurping away! Out of the corner of my eye i noticed that my spicy tuna was dropped off; but where's the katsu bowl?! I quickly notice the fried chicken and avert my attention. LoL! Getting down into my bowl I started to realize that more isn't always better. The fried chicken was actually fried, so having been sitting in my broth even for the few minutes before I got the bowl they were already soggy and I've got to be honest the batter was really yummy, but it was just a fried chicken; my gf and I were like \"let's get some wings @ KFC after this.\" The broth was flavorful, you could taste the miso with the inclusion of all the meats, but I thought it was a bit oily compared to other broths I've had that had more of a refreshing taste. As for price to bowl size ratio, I felt that my ~$11 bowl which was pretty much a combo bowl was worth it given the contents. As for the spicy tuna roll, it was really spicy and didn't have a frozen taste, I was very satisfied =D\n\nWhen we both finished though, we still didn't have the katsu bowl. I asked the waitress to check on it and she told me that they were preparing it just then...20 minutes after we got our other food and finished.... I cancelled it, we were already full; we were disappointed, she really had a katsu urge. Overall, we both agreed that the restaurant served pretty good dishes, not the best, but certainly not the worst; if you're in that part of town try it out! But be weary they can get really busy; probably why our dish was forgotten =X", "author": "Jon K."}

In addition, to the ramen, I also tried things from the sushi bar.\n\nGOOD:\n- The ramen noodles were still good.\n\nJUST OK:\n- Uni ikura don was not very good. Ikura was mushy and the eggs were a little dried out instead of bursting with juices. The uni was not as bad but average at best. \n\nBAD: \n- The ramen broth sucked again. I got the salt broth this time around and it was on the oily side again and was still bland overall. The broths here are a total disgrace (see my prior review).\n- The chirashi was a horrible value. For $19, they were very skimpy on the sashimi (only like 6 pieces), which was average quality at best. \n- The sushi rice had too much vinegar and was sour. It was also served hot, which warmed up the sashimi that was sitting on top of it.\n\nCONCLUSION: I have no idea why other Yelpers love the ramen here. Even the ramen places in Japantown are better than this and those places aren't even that great either.", "author": "Alex P."}

Perhaps katana-ya is a common name....\n\nI came here early on a Friday night, party of two, the place was quiet. It has kind of  a moody atmosphere because they were playing some chill out tunes of the late 90s variety. It was a bit hard for me to decide since there was a lot to choose from, so I set my mind on their ramen and maguro don combo. \n\nI wasn't sure how the portions were divvied up, but if you order one of their ramen/soba/udon combos, what you get is a large bowl of noodles with a small portion of whatever side you choose. In my case, I got this giant bowl of ramen in a thick and slick miso broth with a slice of chashu and some bamboo shoots, and a petite bowl of fresh maguro over sushi rice. \n\nNow, the miso broth is indeed greasy, and you shouldn't have it more than once a week and definitely high in salt, but it definitely packed a lot of flavor. For the price of this, I could have used 1 more slice of chashu. But oh well! The noodles had good body.\n\nThe maguro don was probably the better part of my meal. The tuna was flavored, cut in thin slices and it was damn good. They didn't overlook their sushi rice as it was damn good x2. Having the combo satisfied cravings as I always want to order something that comes with a bunch of stuff, and it was actually just the right amount of food.\n\nI also tried their california roll. It kind of looks (a bit more rice and sliced too pristinely)  like the kind you get at a supermarket but upon taste, it was pretty damn good. Comparable to the ones (ugliest but best in my book) from Tani's Kitchen in Daly City. \n\nThe chicken karaage looked the same as before, but I was too full to try a piece of it. \n\nKatana-ya filled up over the course of our meal, and it was full by the time we left. Good to also know that it's open pretty late.\n\nTheir food is solid, but because I think the prices are a bit inflated, my 4 stars is actually a 3.5. \n\nDamn them downtown real estate prices!", "author": "Faffy L."}

I've been here a few times already but have had the unfortunate incident to travel with others who are not avid food eaters :( THIS time was going to be different! I came with my boyfriend, and of course with our luck, the night before he got food poisoning. (Poor thing.) Luckily, it only lasts about 24 hrs so when we landed, we were already past the 12 hr mark and I'm secretly thinking, \"Hurry up and feel better 'cause I wanna be fat and happy damnit!\" I'm such a good girlfriend.\nSo it's about 4, 5pm and he states he is starting to get his appetite back. (Yay!!!) We go on Yelp, type in \"Ramen\" in the search box and the first place that comes up is Katana-Ya. 4 Stars and over 1,900 reviews? Sounded great to us!\n\nCustomer Service (part one): We arrive and the place is really small, no big deal; it's expected. No line = no wait. Awesome! 3 employees were talking in the back so we just took that as a hint that we needed to seat ourselves. I overheard them speaking Japanese to each other and I'm fluent in Japanese and it's so much easier to order; not to mention getting your order right!  One of the girls comes over, asks what we would like and i start ordering in Japanese... i looked up from the menu and she just stared at me like i had a severe case of something or another. I instantly became uncomfortable.. there was about a good 5 second silence. She didn't say anything; just stood there with her pen to the pad and giving me a blank look. After i realized that maybe she was just a fimbot and she was short circuiting, i repeated my order again; this time in Engrish. She jotted it down and walked away. We should've just left then but with all the reviews we were really here for the food and looking forward to it.\n\nRamen: Oh Thank God it's here!!! :D It looks awesome and smells heavenly and I can't wait to dig in the forget about the incident that happened with our waitress. They looked like Toyko Style noodles and I had ordered it with the Spicy-miso broth.. the bf got the same broth and had bbq pork tossed in it too. Ok, first bite in and... What. The. Fuck. These noodles SUCK. They were entirely too gummy like they had either been sitting out for a long time or someone tossed them back into the microwave to re-heat them. Damnit but i'm sooo hungry!! Correction: We're so hungry!! My bf and i were discussing how disappointed we were with the noodles BUT the one thing that was awesome was the broth. At least they had that going for them. Zero on noodles but 5 stars on the broth. Can you really give a good review on a polished turd?\n\nCustomer Service (part deux): We had to flag our waitress down to get our check, meantime I'm starting to doubt myself. \"Maybe that wasn't Japanese I heard? Maybe she wasn't speaking Japanese in the back with the other two employees?\" While she was getting our check, my doubts were completely dissolved. Oh ya, she was speaking Japanese alright. I couldn't catch their conversation since we had a party between us but she was talking about something being super big.. \"sugooi ookii na-\" and that's all i caught, but i heard words here and there,  \"uso\"- liar, \"kawaii\"- cute, \"nande\"- why.. \nUgh, i think it goes without saying. Zero on the customer service.\n\nIn conclusion to this novel I realize that maybe we just came at a really bad time. I mean, there was no line so we didn't have the freshest of noodles, i would definitely like to try this place again but i can't bring myself there after the customer service experience.

I had the light broth, and the boyfriend had the rich broth.  I liked the light broth better, I thought it was perfectly flavored and not too oily.  The rich broth was (obviously) thicker.

Better yet, just pick up a box at TJ's and let me order my ramen! It didn't help that when he left, the biggest d-bag said, \"Are you guys ready?!\" to the group ahead of us. They nodded emphatically and d-bag said, \"Yeah, well we waited a fucking hour in the cold!\" Good for you, did you also have to wait for a group of d-bags like yourself?\n\nAnyway, the food was brought out pretty quick and it was delicious. They actually had butter corn ramen! Usually when I first eat at a ramen place, I'll go for the shoyu as a test but I absolutely could not pass up the butter corn (with the salt broth). The noodles were perfect, just as good as Suzu; broth was better; and char-su was about the same (small).\n\nEven better about this place? The sushi is actually good! Usually when a ramen place combines with sushi, the quality / serving is pretty crappy / small. I was super stoked on the rolls (hawaiian i think) and nigiri.\n\nThey need a better system like they have at Ryowa or Santa.

I got there at 6:40pm, put our names down on the waitlist, and luckily, a table was ready for us by 7pm.  I got the Katanaya Ramen because it comes with everything, and that's what most of us got.  I got mine with soy based broth, but I also got to try the miso broth from a friend.  At $12.90, this is a very expensive bowl of ramen.  I'd say that it was very good, but I wasn't blown away by the flavor.  Maybe my expectations were too high because this place has over 2000 reviews.   I was expecting something amazing, like Orenchi ramen down in Santa Clara, but the broth here was nothing special.  I also thought that the chasu was flavorful, but not as tender as I'd like.  On the plus side, the fried chicken and the fried dumplings in the ramen were both very good and a cool addition to the dish.  The chicken was moist, tender and tasty and I would be happy with just a bowl of that.  The fried gyoza were also delicious.  We also ordered a side of the spicy tuna roll, which I also thought was very good.  At $6, it is steep for spicy tuna, but it is one of the better spicy tuna rolls that I have had.\n\nI think the food here is good, but a bit overpriced.

We thought, \"what better way to see the landmark than to bike across it,\" right? Yes, it was breathtaking. Yes, it was magnificent. But, oh what torture on our lethargic Texan bodies accustomed to only waddling to our cars and from our cars to the nearest BBQ or fast food joint. \n\nPale-faced and deathly-exhausted, we walked to the nearest cable car (Powell-Hyde) and unexpectedly waited another 45 minutes clad in summer clothing in the freezing cold (50 degree) night -- who would've thought tourists would be lined up for cable cars at 9:30 PM and WHY was it so bitterly cold in the middle of summer? To add to our wonderful day, I then got crapped on by a pigeon, but let's not bask in my misfortune. Despite the amount of tremendous pain, physical torture, and nature's gift of feces, it was all forgotten once the first bite of hot, spicy ramen rejuvenated the deprived palate at Katana-ya. \n\nWe started our recovery with Temaki hand rolls. One order comes with three rolls - spicy tuna, unagi, and salmon (I think) - all of which were pretty solid and refreshing. Nothing spectacular, though. \n\nMy friend ordered the spicy tofu ramen and I ordered the BBQ pork ramen extra spicy (no other way) -- both miso based. Her broth was thick, not too spicy, and full of flavor. I've never had thick ramen broth before, so this was quite unusual for me, but it was surprisingly delicious nonetheless. My broth was also thick, but completely red. They weren't messing around when they meant extra spicy. It burned my mouth, lit my esophagus on fire, and warmed my body from the inside out -- it was bliss. Even through all that spice, I could still savor the full flavor of the ramen broth and enjoy the hint of pork aroma. What really sets this ramen place apart from others is its ramen noodle consistency. To me, it wasn't rubbery or too soft, but cooked just right so that it had solid texture and great bite feel. I knew this was just as satisfying to my friend as it was to me when I saw life flow back into her nose and cheeks. \n\nTo say that this was the best ramen I've ever had would not be a gross overstatement, but it is ranked very close to the top.

In fact, the broth with some crusty bread would an ideal late night food after an alcohol-fueled Friday or Sat. night.\n\nThe rest of our meal was not quite as good as the ramon.  There was some interesting sushi options on the menu but I wasn't crazy about what we ordered.  Quality of the seafood (yellowtail tuna, scallops) was so-so and presentation was a bit sloppy.  Plus, our orders arrived ad hoc and not at the same time.  \n\nService was definitely not a strong point.  Waitress was friendly but she was just not on top of anything.  Our orders came out at different times but that is probably an issue with the back-end of the restaurant. I know from previous experience as a waiter.  It can be incredibly frustrating to deal with especially if customers don't understand that.    \n\nWhat bothered me was that our waitress seemed lackadaisical.

On a rainy night.  In the full swing of holiday season.  With a sick boy who didn't want to have to park and walk more than a block away.  We happen upon it with not much ado; naturally we drive by Ruby Skye with the line curling around the block.  We see Union Square with the hordes of shoppers and tourists wandering about.  We drive along the jammed street parking with nary a space except for the hotel unloading/ loading zones. We make a halfhearted attempt to enter the Post-Taylor garage to park and back out immediately nearly killing some pedestrians after reading \"$5.50 ... first 20 minutes...\"\n\nSo the boy gets dropped off and I begin to circle.  He reads me the menu over the phone and we make our selections.  And I circle. And circle. And circle.  Eventually I park illegally in a white zone in front of the Donatella Hotel - across from that crazy wraparound Ruby Skye line.  I wait.  I text the boy.  I see a message on the Crackberry that reads \"Parking. Hurry.\"  Springing into action I round the corner to see the boy waving me into a spot that appears to have just opened in front of the ramen house.\n\nAs I pull in, I see someone run out of Katana-Ya with our dinner, hand it to the boy, who gets into the car.   \"I almost got nailed by someone who wanted this space.  He was so mad that I wouldn't move he chucked a full water bottle at me.\"\n\nWas it worth it?\n\n2 ramen soups (shoyu, one with pork and light, one with negi onion and rich, both very redolent of konbu and bamboo shoots); 2 sushi rolls (albacore + maguro over cali roll); I sake nigiri; 1 seaweed salad = around $60 with tip.\n\nWas it worth it?\nNot so sure... we may be back someday, definitely sans car... perhaps if we somehow have to be in that Ruby Skye line ...", "author": "Claudine C."}

How this statistic correlates to food quality is debatable, but for Katana Ya it says something good.\n\nMy companion and I both ordered ramen. I chose the spicy onion, which comes with a slice of pork. (Vegetarians: take note.) The spicy onion fragrance is delightful. The dish has a nice balance of textures; the supple noodles are complemented by crunchy bamboo. My friend got the pork bowl, which had a few more slices than mine. The portions aren't huge, but the ramen is still priced reasonably--for the neighborhood.\n\nOn this Thursday night, we arrived at 8:30 and waited 15 minutes for a table for two. The restaurant can accommodate groups of four comfortably. At 9, a party of Japanese girls swept in without a wait. They were greeted with a smile by the hostess.

Katana-Ya's proportion is too small (for me) and the ramen doesn't come with an egg (or fat big pieces of pork)!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-09", "description": "I came back here once again with my friend on a very late Tuesday night and we picked this place because they were open late so we wouldn't feel rushed about closing time. This review, however, is not about the food (I would probably give it a 2.5 stars for the soy ramen with deep fried chicken; it was far too salty), it is about the service we got from one particular server.\n\nWe get seated and we pretty much decided relatively quickly what we wanted but the server doesn't come around so we chatted until our server came around. She asks us what we want and my friend orders his ramen and he had to repeat himself three, yes, THREE times to her because she was spacing out and it wasn't even like we weren't responding immediately after being asked what we wanted; it was like she asked us what we wanted and decided to just not listen. Then she would apologize and ask him to repeat himself and again, spaces out... and then again... Now, I understand how this may be a problem for someone who speaks at a lower volume but I can assure you, my friend was speaking more than loud and clearly enough for this to be a non-issue.\n\nThen I'm like whatever, so I order my ramen and she asks us what we want to drink; my friend orders a beer and I just get water. The server then turns around and I kid you not, this was something out of the movies or TV commercial; we hear this very loud \"OH MY GOD!!!\", we turn to see what was going on and she has a friend as a customer and they were hugging and telling each other how good each other looked and all I had to do was roll my eyes. Now, understand this, I do not care if you socialize with your friends after we have been taken care of but do notice that our orders are still in her hands at this point and she is completely oblivious to that fact; she continues to chat with her friend for probably five minutes (if not more) while still holding our orders in her hand.\n\nOne of the other servers then come to us and asked us if we were taken care of and yes, this THING that our server was going on and on for was going on for this long that a person, who, by the way, were not responsible for taking care of us, have noticed that our orders are not in yet. We tell him yes, but our orders have not gone in yet, pointing to our server. He then is kind enough to ask us what we ordered for drinks and we tell him a beer and water and he was kind enough to get us that while we waited for our server to be 'done'. The server then goes in and brings out our water and beer and you guessed it, our server still has our orders in her hand, chatting away with her friend. By now, I'm extremely irritated but I let it slide since I'm not usually one to complain and it was late so I don't think there were any managers around even if I wanted to and if there were managers around, I'm sure he/she would not allow this THING to go on for as long as it did.\n\nFinally, our server is \"done chatting\", brings our orders in and then comes out with a beer and water in her hands, completely oblivious to the fact that someone else has already done that for her. Halfway to our table, she sees that we already got our drinks and she walks away, no apology... nothing. So we wait some time for our food to come and another server brings out our food. While eating, our server is just chatting away with her friend, not bothering to check in with us once and if I didn't know any better, didn't even bother to look at our table. Again, I'm not going to fuss about being checked in on every 5 minutes but maybe once would be nice. We get done eating and we get the check from our server and it is by this time, I wonder if I should even tip. I do tip, and rather generously too since I'm usually not one to be stingy about tipping, I only hope that the tip is being split among the other server because he certainly deserved it more than our supposed server.\n\nI rarely, rarely ever dislike the service I get and even less so to the point where I am compelled to write a review about as I feel it shows poorly on the restaurant and the quality of their food, however, this was unforgivable. If management do read this, I genuinely hope they address this issue because the service we got that night was far beyond poor - it was non-existent. All she did was take our order, hold it in her hands for MUCH longer than was acceptable, paid no attention to us and then got paid to do that while chatting with her friend and note that she wasn't even the one to bring us our food. We would have gotten our food faster if we went into the kitchen and made it ourselves. I'm not sure I want to come back here unless nothing else was open with service like that.", "author": "Richard C."}

Consistent. \n\nThe food-\nRamen: The Katana-Ya ramen bowl is amazing. The noodles are generously portioned, as is the pork and corn. The seaweed and miso broth is mild and flavorful. The kara-age chicken and won-ton are surprisingly tasty and remain fairly crispy throughout. I've had it twice and it was consistent. \n\nSushi: Plain old Salmon nigiri was surprisingly good for a place specializing in ramen. Higher quality than my usual haunt Sushi-boat, if not somewhat more expensive. Second time I had the futomaki, and I was somewhat less happy. The flavor was decent but seemed somewhat small.\n\nService-\nThis place is pretty notorious for the long waits. It really is just a hole in the wall, and depending on your hunger, the 20+minute waits can be a deal-breaker. On the one hand, they very efficient for a small location (ordered lists, menus handed out to upcoming parties to speed the ordering process). On the other hand, it can take upwards of 30 minutes to be seated, and on a chilly night, that can be miserable. Overall, I think it is worth the wait, provided you aren't starving or have some weakness to frost. \n\nBottom-line: Great ramen downtown.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-28", "description": "Let me start by saying that the most perfect bowl of ramen in the United States does not exist in the Bay Area, but is located in the East Village in NYC, at Momofuku.  All ramen is compared to that one bowl, where the pork is Berkshire, the soup is perfectly seasoned, the toppings are extensive and satisfying, and the noodles exactly the right texture.  So, having described my perfect bowl, I've got to say that Katana-Ya doesn't quite reach perfection and instead, rates just an \"okay.\"\n\nHaving waited just about the entire afternoon for our rush tickets to \"Jersey Boys\" across the street, my cousin and I were really excited to go to Katana-Ya for a warming bowl of ramen.  We decided to start with their homemade king crab croquette and then, because we were really hungry, try their ramen combination, which is a bowl of their ramen with your choice of soup and a piece of chashu and a smaller dish- tonkatsu, kimchi fried rice, katsudon, and tempura-don being some of the choices.  I decided to go for the katsudon and my cousin, the tempura-don.  We both decided to try the same kind of ramen- the rich, soy broth.  \n\nThe crab croquette came first- 2 lovely, deep-fried, crisp pieces with a side salad of mixed greens with ranch dressing and some katsu sauce.  Honestly, I couldn't really taste much crab, but the inside of the croquette was creamy and smooth and really tasty.  It was awesome with the katsu sauce.\n\nNext up was the ramen, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The broth was very warming, but it was unbalanced and tasted way too salty.  The ramen noodles seemed a little underdone - I like some texture to my noodles, but these bordered on being hard.  The one piece of chashu we did get was really fatty and really, really salty.  The pork was really unappetizing.  The two rice bowls were nothing special- the tempura-don came with a piece of shrimp and one each of mushroom, green bean, and pumpkin.  Tasty, but nothing exciting.\n\nOverall, the meal at Katana-Ya was very filling and a great way to warm up from the demon Bay Area winds that whipped up yesterday.  Ramen was just okay, while the crab croquettes were wonderful.  I may be back, but only if I'm in the area and craving ramen.", "author": "Angela H."}

Then my youngest sister continued her quest to find the best chicken teriyaki dinner set which is a mission she started ever since she was 12.  (She would only order the same meal just so she could have a common way of ranking every Japanese restaurant she visited.)  The California roll that came with her dinner set was very good and the imitation crab meat fooled me!  Gyoza was tasty but a bit too large and garlicky for me.  I like mine small and love it when they melt in my mouth.  \n\nI'd have to say out of all the different types of ramen the miso was the tastiest and the broth was the most well balanced.  You have the choice of ordering your ramen light or heavy.  I prefer heavy which pretty much means the soup is going to be more dense, creamier and full of flavor.\n\nNothing is better than a hot bowl of ramen, gyoza, fried rice and an ice cold beer on a cold San Francisco night.

That said, I love both of them, and while Katana-Ya doesn't serve the latter, you can find a hot steaming bowl of delicious noodles worthy of devouring in large gulps.  That last line sounded borderline sexual, and food can be, although I don't think ramen exactly qualifies.  I digress.\n\nMy favorite bowl to get at KY is their miso based spicy tofu ramen, which is a wonderful concoction of miso soup, kimchi, and tofu all complimenting a serving of tasty ramen noodles.  The sushi is there is fresh and of good quality, but not the best in the city.  Also good are their a la carte style tempura/chicken katsu/other stuff don bowls, which are like small rice bowls topped with an endless choice of toppings.

But the ramen is the best part.  The Ramen is chewy yet soft and goes very well with the pork & broth.  altogether, not a bad choice.\n\nChicken Karage Ramen w/ Miso Base Soup Rich Broth (2.5/5) - Too much fat..too much richness to it and the Karage is in the soup so it's all soggy by the time you eat it because it's too steaming hot to eat right away.  (By the way, all the stuff you order here when received is usually straight from the cooker, so it's probably a good idea to let the hot food cool down a bit)  Anyway..I think this wasn't the best choice, even though the ramen was good as usual, I was in search of a better flavor for my tastebuds.\n\nKimchi Ramen w/ Soy Base Soup Light Broth (4/5) - I know its a high rating, but when i got the order...the soup had pieces of pork in it!  YESS! BONUS!!...wow that sounded really mature...=/  But anyway, it's good cuz i like spicy food.  I was very satisfied with this ramen choice.  \n\nSpicy Tofu Ramen w/ Soy Base Soup Light Broth (4/5) - This is just as good as Kimchi Ramen because it has ..KIMCHI in the SOUP!  YESS!!  Spicy is good and tasty.  And I give this one a thumbs up for sure.  At least for San Francisco's Ramen Standards.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I like this place...the only reason i give it 3/5 is cuz there are other ramen shops that out do this place anyday.. but if you're in san francisco and are near a bart station or are in search for ramen near the financial district cuz you work there but you hate your job.  Then come on over to Katana-ya..It's just a hop, skip & a jump away from Powell Bart Station...and just a short walk from macy's.\n\nFINAL FINAL FINAL THOUGHTS: I give this place a 8/10 for being convenient and for serving ramen.

That's just robbery to charge someone $10 for some crappy soup base, noodles, and green onion. \n\nOh yeah, I also have to mention the service there. It sucks very slow and biased.

Here's a tip -- go around 6 p.m. An hour or so later, and you'll be fighting the pre-theatre crowd for a spot. \n\nI usually get the light soy broth with either the chicken karaage and the pork when ordering ramen. But the sushi here is also surprisingly good -- I really like the fresh fish. The hamachi is my favorite, though the Tuna Lovers package is great as well. \n\nUnfortunately I have to take a star off for the spotty service. It's usually pretty good, but when things get really crowded, they're not able to handle the situation well. I once had to wait for over 30 minutes to even get a waitress to take my order because they were too busy dealing with the new customers -- they actually got their order before me even though they arrived 15 minutes later. \n\nOther than that, the food is great. So I really recommend going during non-crowded times so you don't get the bad service.", "author": "Nicole L."}

It's in a row of restaurants so it doesn't stand out too much but we noticed it because there was a huge crowed in front of the door. Usually, crowd/line = good food. Using that philosophy, we decided to wait. There is usually a wait because there are only a few tables inside. It's a pretty small shack. We waited about 10 mins before getting seated. Service is good. Kind of an IN & OUT type of joint. \n\nI ordered the Katana-Ya Ramen w/soy because the waiter had recommended it. I am glad I ordered it w/soy instead of miso because the Miso makes it a bit salty. I also added \"EXTRA SPICY\" to the bowl b/c everything tastes better spicy right? There was too much going on in my bowl of Ramen. Should have known that fried won tons & fried chicken wouldn't taste that great w/ramen but I wanted to try something new. The \"EXTRA SPICY\" was EXTRA NOT SO SPICY. I was disappointed. The bowl came out red like chili but lacked any spice. They charge you $1.50 to add spice to your bowl, but all it did was change your soup color from bland to orange. The noodles they used didn't feel like Ramen noodles to me. Felt like they were the same noodles used at pepper lunch. Maybe that's 'rea'l Ramen, maybe it's not. I'm just use to a softer noodle in my Ramen.  For $14, I expected better results from a 4 star Ramen joint and for them to master the art of making spice. \n\nWe also ordered tuna sashimi as an appetizer. It came out looking fresh and delicious but when we bit into it, it was different. It was pretty chewy, from beginning to end. $10 for 5 pieces, a little pricey. \n\nI've had better for cheaper.", "author": "Katherina H."}

The broth is rich, on the thicker side, and loaded with flavor. I'd go for the light version though because I can see how the thicker broth can get overwhelming. The noodles seem like they are hand made and as fresh as I've consistently eaten with the soft texture and enough to soak up the flavor the broth. The Karage is just the icing on the cake with the crunchiness at the beginning and softens up after soaking in the broth. \n\nI'm always on a ramen hunt wherever I go, and this place still takes the top spot for me. Even if you don't think that it is the best like I do, you still won't get a bad meal.", "author": "vic w."}

I had pretty high expectations after hearing that this place is often compared to Santa Ramen.  We had a party of 6 so it took a while to be seated, but the waiting wasn't too bad.  i ordered the BBQ Pork Ramen with light soy sauce broth.  At first it was a bit conflicting because every other ramen choice came with meat too (except for the spicy tofu ramen) but meat in my ramen is a must.  I was satisfied with the amount of pork, but the non-wavy ramen noodles threw me off.  I know I shouldn't let the look of the ramen affect my experience, but it does and I can't explain it.  Anyhow, the broth was good but I've had better.  It was a satisfying meal and I even found a piece of pork at the bottom of my bowl to my surprise, which made me very happy.  But 9.80 for a bowl of simply satisfactory ramen?  I'd rather go to Kahoo.     \n\nOn another note, they charge .50 for butter so if you want the butter corn ramen sans butter, it's 50 cents cheaper!  Also my friends were kind of sad about the meager one piece of pork they got in their bowls.", "author": "Lydia W."}

The fried chicken ramen was good although my wife got the regular ramen and it didn't have enough veggies and meat in it (1 slice of pork). The bowls are huge. So big you get a ladle instead of a spoon. \n\nWhat we were surprised with was the sushi. $5.50 for two pieces of Toro and $6.50 for Mixed Fish salad. Both good. Check the specials board.

I'll get into those reasons later but let's start out with the positive points. It's open pretty late so you can go here after a rough night of drinking (although I've never actually been here after drinking so I can only imagine that it would be a good recovery area). The reason why I've never been here after drinking is that I like to catch the lunch specials and I don't get plastered during the afternoon. Anyways I like the miso ramen and curry or kimchee fried rice. The miso ramen looks and has the texture of mud...but this mud is AMAZING. The thick salty miso coats the ramen so well that half the soup will be gone even if u don't drink any. Add extra spicy to the base and you will be in for a real treat. The first time I had it, I thought it was pretty weak. As I drank more of the soup I realized that I no longer had miso in my bowl....I had a bowl of lava. My face dripped with sweat and my nose ran like a faucet. \n\nAs  much as I love torturing myself with spicy foods here, there are some flaws here. It's located near Union Square so parking will cost an arm and a leg if you don't finish in 1 hour. Assuming you come here during lunch time, you will be here at LEAST an hour because of the massive line due to limited seating. Also even with the lunch special, the meal will not be cheap since prices have risen of the past couple of years. Finally they took curry off the lunch special! I came here one time deciding if I should get kimchee fried rice or curry with my miso ramen and was GREATLY disappointed to see that curry was crossed off the list! I was leaning towards kimchee fried rice anyways, but not having the curry option made me want curry instead. I ended up getting only extra spicy miso ramen.\n\nI really like this place but I don't like the prices and how it's so packed during the day. I would definitely recommend this place for a date if you want to heat things up.....with a bowl of extra spicy ramen.", "author": "Michael Y."}

We knew that we would have to wait a while because of our large group and the small restaurant, and we were okay with that. The waitress initially asked us if we were willing to be split up into two parties, but since the point of dinner was to eat together, we told her we'd wait instead. The problem was that we ended up waiting nearly 1.5 hours, while they seated and turned over at least 10 tables of 2 who came after us. Basically, they wouldn't hold any tables open at all to even try to combine two tables to seat us, even though there was another group of 7 waiting behind us on the list. It wasn't until my friend told the waitress that they had not been accommodating until they finally held a table for us and seated us within 10 minutes.  Not only that, but the waitress gave us attitude when we expressed how long we'd been waiting... basically she asked us how we expected to eat with so many people at such a small restaurant. I understand that it's more profitable for a restaurant to seat smaller tables that turn over faster, but seriously, do you ignore customers for over an hour and wait for a large table to magically appear? I didn't understand that logic.\nAnd to be completely honest, the chasu ramen was only okay. It's supposed to be the best ramen in the City, but I'm a little skeptical. The ramen was nice and chewy and the miso soup was rich, but not really worth the wait or drive to me. Personally, I've had comparable ramen at Maru Ichi in the South Bay for a much shorter wait (and less attitude). \nCome here with 3 or less people or else expect to wait forever.", "author": "Jen T."}

There were a few couples before us, but the 30 minutes wait was worth it knowing that the food you will get will be so satisfying. While waiting, I studied the menu posted on the window and looked through the window to peek at what people ordered. There was this couple that sat by the window that ordered 4 different dishes. The ramen bowls themselves were gigantic, but they also got some curry and katsu rice bowls. My eyes were amazed by their big appetites. \n\nIronically, we got seated by the window table. People who were waiting outside probably think and did the same thing as I did..haha. I ordered the spicy tofu ramen with miso broth while my boyfriend got the lunch special - the regular ramen with miso broth and katsu-don. So the couple who sat by the window before us ordered this special lunch menu, but you really need a big appetite to finish a bowl of ramen and rice. The price is attractive though and you can always pack the rice bowl to go to eat it for another meal if you can't finish it all.\n\nThe food was delicious with some drools just looking at it. The miso broth wasn't too rich and oily. The regular ramen was missing some corn though, otherwise the crunchiness of the ramen and corn together would be the perfect chew. The katsu-don was decent, but wasn't the best. I think my spicy tofu ramen was the best of all the dishes we ordered. It was spicy, but wasn't too spicy that overwhelmed your taste buds.

Have some mercy for those out in the cold waiting to get inside.  If you want to enjoy your conversation, find a cafe and continue talking.  Enough said. Back to the food.\n\nThought I'd try their well known BBQ Pork Ramen (soy broth) and a small order of fried rice, aka the Ichiro special. The noodles were quite good, and the broth was okay. The pork, however, was a bit bland and dry.  The small side of fried rice was a surprising treat.  Light yet well flavored with pieces of beef and ginger.

My last experience was when I asked to put in an order after 10 mins sitting there trying to get the waitresses' attention. I got harassed and was almost lost my temper since I thought I supposed to be served as a customer, not as a beggar. I got comment as, \"I am on break\" after she just took an order and \"you can't wait, hmm\" with dirly looks. In addition, I got shorted change once for $5 so make sure to count you change in this place.\n\nOverall, I don't know how long I can tolerate their bad customer service for the noodles...something got to give and I think I will cross out this place of my list of restaurants to go to in SF.\n\nThis is very unusual for a Japanese restaurant since Japanese is well known for customer service.", "author": "Dennis P."}

One of those unfortunate situations where before I ever tried their food, every time I'd pass by, I'd see a massive, massive line and think, \"my god, people are really going nuts for this spot. I bet it's great.\" Well, like I said, I went several times and it was never great. In fact, it was barely even mediocre. It's actually been a while since I was last there, but I remember having their house Chashu Ramen or whatever their signature dish was and just feeling let down. Also, I remember one of the times the service was awful. That probably affects my rating. Waiting 30 minutes + for a bowl of ramen is ridiculous, especially when you  people who sat down after you got their food first. I will admit that part of my disappointment might derive from the fact that I'm from Los Angeles, and that I spent most of my life being spoiled by the fantastic selection of ramen joints throughout the city. Maybe compared to other joints in San Francisco this place is more of a 3 or 3 and a half, regardless, I have to stick by my guns and just say, this place is subpar, sowwy.

The soup broth is pretty good, I happily drank the whole damn thing every time. The Katana-ya ramen is really just a whole bunch of random food (potstickers, fried chicken) piled into the soup, and is really only there for the novelty.

That was the only weird part of the rolls, but other than that, there was nothing for me to complain about.\n\nThe restaurant is small, but yet there were many people waiting outside to be seated.

Sure, there's a bit of oil floating on the top of the soup, but nothing really noteworthy, at least all the times I've been there.  That actually sort of got my hopes up after reading the reviews here before going there the first time.  I was hoping for a really rich tonkotsu-y broth like I've had multiple times in Japan at places like Jangarra Ramen in Tokyo.  None of this lightly brown tinted clear broth.

My expectations were wearily high.  Lucky for my belly, the Katanaya ramen proved every bit as good as I could possibly expect!  \n\nThe loaded broth comes thick and murky, with rich concentrated savory flavor.  It's a very hearty style of ramen -- my favorite kind!  I read that many enthusiasts preferred the shoyu ramen here, but I did not try it.  Noodle texture is perfect.  This particular bowl gets a bit oily as it has the fried gyoza, fried chicken (karaage), as well as BBQ pork and buttered corn.  All had great flavor.  If I actually lived in San Francisco I'd probably go for the less orgiastic options for casual eating and switch between rich and light broths, but I only had a short time to stay so I wanted to try as many things as possible in a bowl.  The end result is mind bogglingly rich, probably injurious to some people.  Good thing I happen to enjoy extremely rich dishes.  It is definitely better than any ramen I've eaten in Atlanta.  I am envious also that this good stuff (plus curry rice and donburis, mmm) can be gotten at 2 in the morning.\n\nI liked it so much I ate here again the night before flying back.  Next time, I will try some South Bay ramen places.", "author": "Kozmo C."}

Needless to say there had been much anticipation, excitement, and yelp research done in the meantime.  I don't know if I had elevated my hopes way to high, hoping for the slurp of pure bliss broth and noodle that I had been reading about.  I really hate to say that I was genuinely disappointed with my vegetable ramen with miso broth (no specified richness), which I've had at pretty much every other ramen place I've been to that serves it.  It's, I think, about the 3rd priciest ramen, so I was thinking sweeeet, cook loads of veggies. Instead I got julienne zucchini and onions, and endless julienne carrots.  The sweet cooked carrots must have released way to much sweet into the broth, because the miso broth was just mehhhh and a little sweet.  No umami euphoria for me.  I was really sad to say that it wasn't my favorite.  The noodles were pretty tasty, but out of habit I compare every noodle to J-Town's Sapporo-Ya, and these didn't rock my little ramen socks.\n\nThe two empty stars I'm leaving blank for now because I want to give it another shot.  My boyfriend had the Katana-Ya Ramen with shoyu broth, and that broth was pretty flippin' tasty, definitely another dimension of yum.  So the stars I am giving are for HIS dish, and I will return to try the soy, shoyu with different richness and different topping in the ramen. I know there is potential... ?  Oh, good noodle:broth ratio too. The service was all right, wait was not terrible for a Thursday 8pm. I also love the no-shame-\"MSG added\" blurb on the menu, awesome, no fronting here.\n\nSo I had decided already when I was there that I'm going back, I have to, I really want to like this place, I'll mess around with the richness, lightness, broth flavors, toppings, etc.  But if after the 2nd or 3rd time I'm still not impressed, the next review won't be as hopeful.  I really want to experience what these ~1700 people are raving about.  Idk, personally I like my ramen in very traditional settings where I know, see, and can feel the freshness in the noodle and the broth.

You also have the choice to make your broth rich, which the server said meant \"more oily.\" Of course I made mine rich. Gimme them calories. More rich, more flavorful. I initially was skeptical about the fried chicken because I knew it was going to get soggy in the soup. The 3 chunks of chicken (dark meat) I got in the soup turned out tasty. I love the yellow egg noodles that are perfect in texture with its right bite of chewiness. \n\nPho is good and ramen is a great alternative-- flavorful, hearty meal in a bowl. I will definitely come back because there are so many combinations to try.

I was there before my friend, and the hostess kindly showed me to a seat at the bar quickly. The space is small, but cozy. It has a nice ambiance (if you try to ignore the inevitable tacky Christmas lights). My friend arrived, and we chose our grub: I got the ramen with light soy broth and chicken karaage; he got the combo of 4 pieces of nigiri and ramen with salt broth (it comes with pork slices). \n\nI can't begin to tell you the love I have for Asian noodle soup, no matter what country it comes from. I am an equal opportunity nood-slurper. The keys to great noodle soup are the basics: the noodles and the soup. I like my noodles perfectly cooked, and for ramen, it has to have some chewiness to it. These ramen were cooked just right, not too soggy or too undercooked. The broth has to have full flavor, which either takes MSG (tsk tsk) or time and effort. The broth was a bit salty for my taste, but it was full flavored. If you just ate the noodles, it was perfect, with just the right amount of flavor riding along with the noodles. The broth must also be hot enough (temperature-wise). I personally like my food screaming hot, and this was tongue-burninatingly hot.... just the way I like it. \n\nThe ingredients themselves were decent. I got 3 pieces of fried chicken, which were good. There were a few pieces of seaweed and a pickled daikon floating around. The ramen didn't need a lot of ingredients, as the soup flavor married with the noodles took the main stage. \n\nIt wasn't as mind-blowing as the $6 bowl of ramen I had in Japan, but that's the real thing... and a long flight + hundreds of dollars away.

I recommend this place, not for big groups since this place is so tiny but for a couple its great.

There's no difference between the regular and cilantro ramen. $1 for an added herb??\n\ni don't usually get the miso broth because it's usually really salty at other places, but this one was good! it was creamy deliciousness.\n\nthe spicy hamachi was ... what's the best word to describe... MEH... BLEH...  bland. probably because our taste buds were satisfyingly swimming in broth that it completely rejected the sushi. \n\nthey have a bunch of other random things on their menu too.. including shaved ice!\n\nYAY i found another good place to eat around union square (this and 'out the door' in the westfield mall basement) that isn't touristy, a chain or in a shotty area! i feel pretty safe walking around here", "author": "Marian C."}

On the upside we walked right in and got a table with no waiting; that was lucky as we watched the crowd grow outside (*note to crowd; I know you want to come in and you're eager and all, but it helps if you actually STEP ASIDE and let me out when I'm trying to leave.  It's really in your best interest, promise.)\nThe sushi was okay, but I was too distracted by all the little flies flying around and attempting to get into my mouth every time I opened it to shove a massive roll into it.  Fecking things.  We had the toro sashimi, hamachi roll and lava roll (which was way too huge for one bite - can't sushi come in sizes?  with smaller bites for ladyfolk and children?).\nThe noodles were disappointing.  I got the bbq pork with soy based broth and it was meh.  There was a weird aftertaste.  Give me Suzu any day, or at least post the \"secret\" delicious noodle bowl that I should be ordering to get the \"omg Katana-Ya is the best noodle place in SF\" experience.  I didn't drink all of my broth, but the noodles were fine and I liked all of the green onions in the broth; they added great flavor.\nI'm glad that the noodle place I like better is so much closer to my house, that works out well for me.

SUCCESS! \n\nLocation- very close to our hotel in Union Square. It was like a 10 min walk for us. Right across from a huge theater. so look for that. The Front is very narrow, we almost missed it. \n\nService/atmosphere- just go in the door and sign your name on the wait list, the go wait outside. They will come for you. We waited about 15 mins around midnight Friday night. This place is very small... maybe 35-40 people at a time. The service was adequate, but not superb. Get your order in, get food, get out. Only took about 10 mins to get our food. \n\nFood- \nApp- salmon skin salad\nEntree 1- Regular ramen, miso broth (you choose between soy sauce, miso and salt broth). Came with scallions, seaweed, bamboo shoots and pork. \nEntree 2- Katanaya Ramen, miso broth.  Came with fried chicken, potstickers, bbq pork, boiled egg, corn, scallions, seaweed, and bamboo shoots.  \n\nSalmon skin salad was simple but tasty, I would get it again. \n\nThe  regular ramen was AMAZING. The broth was rich, but I needed to add a lot of chili powder. If you like spicy, pay the extra for the spicy version. The noodles were chewy... in the good way. The pork slices were AWESOME. I was trying to spoon the ramen at first but then I just gave up and used my chopsticks for the noodles. Dont be afraid to slurp.\n\n\nThe Katanaya Ramen was good, especially for someone who doesn't normally eat Japanese.  The extra bit of meat helped to familiarize it so it wasn't too big of a shock at trying something a little different.  The portions are huge and I definitely had a hard time finishing.  For the price you get HUGE portions.  The fried chicken was very tasty and the potstickers were perfectly prepared .  The seaweed texture left a bit to be desired, but like I said I don't eat Ramen often.    \n  \nIf I come back to the bay area, I am definitely going here again.", "author": "Tara G."}

Fried chicken n pot sticker in a ramen noodle soup?  Don't think it mixes well. Pork was ok. Egg was served in two pieces hard boiled, not the usual liquidy in the inside.

The sushi is okay, certainly not Sushi Ran, but nice on the side.  Tuna salad as a free appetize rather disconcerted me.  It can get crowded on week-ends and late night due to its hole-in-the-wall size, but on weekdays it's no worries.  The noodles aren't as wellmade as say Suzu Ramen in J-town, or Santa Ramen in San Mateo, or in the Ebisu district in Tokyo,  but they certainly fill the belly with carbs, if that's your aim.  An interesting point that a friendly young woman  I met there yesterday evening noticed:  they were playing mexican music up in there.

We ordered gyoza as an appetizer, and each ordered a ramen: all rich miso broths: one regular, one chicken, one deep-fried chicken, and one BBQ Pork (mine).\n\nSo basically, come here for the ramen, and it is amazing.  I'm not a ramen connoisseur, but I know good food, and this qualifies.  The gyoza, on the other hand, left a bit to be desired: I agree with one reviewer who stated that the vegetables are overpowering.  Avoid the gyoza.  But for the ramen, major yays.\n\nWe have to lose a star here for the quality of service.  We were seated, given menus, and about 5 minutes later, the waittress came back to take our orders.  All well and good.  She brings us our drinks and then comes back a bit later with the ramen.  All well and good, except that the gyoza didn't come out until we were about halfway through the ramen.  We got no refills of our tea the entire meal, and the second that the majority of us were finished (I'm a slow eater), the check was rushed over, the implication clear that we were not to linger any longer than necessary.\n\nIt's a little crowded (especially if you're a party of 4), but it's great ramen, so come here for that and look no further!", "author": "Alex B."}

It was a real hole in a wall place and really small. I had the ramen with chicken karaage but asked the chicken to be on the side. I'm not a fan of soggy batter. The batter was light and crisp. The noodle was simple yet yummy. I'm getting HUNGRY just thinking about it!!! The broth was just right (not too salty for me) yet full of flavor. I went with the original broth but supposedly if you order the rich broth, they put in more pork fat. \n\nI was tempted to order their red bean shaved ice but I was sooooo full, my stomach couldn't handle it; neither could my gf. \n\nTheir ramen is about 9-10 but if you get the combo, it can vary from 9-15. The combo comes with some donburi. Good thing I didn't order it cause I wouldn't be able to eat it and I hate wasting food.

It wasn't completely intentional; I was actually looking for sushi on most of the occasions, but I was surprised by how common ramen is on most Japanese menus, and I couldn't resist the temptation to tuck into a steaming bowl of noodle soup on a cold, foggy night (...and a crisp summer afternoon...and a warm, sunny evening...)\n\nThe dining scene in San Francisco is much more calm than New York.  While people do get excited about good food and new restaurants, I don't think there will ever be a ramen stir like Dave Chang caused with his Momofuku empire.  Service in San Francisco can be extremely relaxed, sincerely friendly, and sometimes the servers are even affectionate.  However, restaurants are usually small, dirty, and one is required to ask for a key to the washroom, which is often attached to an embarrassingly oversized doodad that I am embarrassed to carry across the dining room.  This bothered me tremendously.  I wanted formal service, clean facilities, and I didn't want to be seated next to boxes of hot sauce and paper towels.  \n\nSuch was the case with Katana-Ya.  Tiny, stale and crowded, I wanted to turn on my heels and go to St. Elsewhere. But snobbery is unacceptable in this town, so I selected the Spicy Tofu Ramen and tucked into a tiny table in the corner.  I expected a watery, vegetable broth and a few scallions, but instead was treated to an over-sized bowl of creamy soy broth with subtle spice, firm tofu and slurp-worthy noodles.  Of my many bowls of ramen since arriving, Katana-Ya makes the most satisfying and authentic version yet.", "author": "T. L."}

So my ravenous friend ate his bowl of ramen and then ate the rest of mine. Easily. I found out the next day that my two companions each snuck a piece of chicken, which I obviously did not see.

The sushi is very good, reasonably priced, and the place can stand on it's own as a sushi bar.\nSo while it was cold, windy and rainy in SF, I figured it was a good time to try the ramen.\nI've gone through the shoyu, miso, tan tan phases and now find myself ordering shio ramen.  The taste of the shio is typically not overpowering and it's also not easy to find a ramen shop that makes a tasty shio broth because it'll either be too salty or too bland.  But I've found a great shio broth at Katana-Ya.  It could have been partly because it was so cold outside, but the shio ramen with vegetables was excellent.\nThe downside is the price.  $11 for a vegetable ramen.  A little pricey, but worth it.\nCan't go wrong with this place ordering either the sushi or ramen.", "author": "Greg S."}

It's actually a difficult review because it is forcing me to remember the horrid experience. I don't know what locals are thinking is good ramen, but it sure isn't this place. Not only was it ranked high on Yelp but also ZAGAT, TripAdvisor and even on ramen specific rankings! Are you kidding me?! This was perhaps one of the worst ramens I've ever eaten! It is insanity to stand outside waiting for a table (in the cold!) for a bowl of nasty. The noodles has a very strange taste and texture to them. The soup was bland. The portion of the ingredients was decent. Also, having a larger group, they threw us down the basement (which at first seemed like a good thing after all) but then they turned on their sound system and had dance music booming as if it were some underground rave party. Was this some kind of joke?! Who plays bass thumping music like that at a ramen shop? Food and ambiance already killed ALL of our experience here. It can't get worse right? Wrong! The service is lamentable. Our server had no clue what he was doing. Either he was new there or just an airhead. Maybe he was overwhelmed by the 4 tables he was serving downstairs in the basement? It is very irritating though (anytime but especially after already having had a bad dining experience) when the dining guest needs to wait 1) to receive the check and 2) to have to wait around to pay the check after having received it!!! Okay, enough said, I am starting to relive that torment of the experience.....it is actually worth only 1 star! And that's a generous star too! You'd have to be hammered drunk silly and out of your mind to go here and enjoy the ramen! If your sane, stay away.

My sons, 10 and 12, devoured their noodles with gusto.  The broth was tasty, and the noodles were well cooked but not mushy (a pet peeve of mine).

Actually, you can probably get in with little no wait at lunch, but definitely count on being quoted the wrong wait time and waiting at least an hour for a table at dinner.  I went Saturday night for a friend's send off dinner--and we ended up waiting 1 hour and 50 minutes.  That would be a deal breaker for me, but the friends I was with are fiends for their ramen.\n\nThe wait wasn't too big of a deal for us because of the convenient coffee places available to fend off the cold San Franciscan night while we waited.  We chose Starbucks--green tea lattes are good for the soul and no one rushes you out of a coffee shop.  Good times and good conversation are part of the dining-out ambiance, and if you're getting pissed off about waits...I challenge you to question who you're spending your time with.\n\nOn to the food!  I like how you can customize your broth-- central options include a miso base which is good for bland soups, or a soy base if you're the type you can't stand anything too salty.  That knowledge helped us all order what we were after.  The menu says that only meat broth is available for the ramen, but the waiter told me that wasn't true and he totally hooked me up with a custom veggie broth--scoorre!!  He warned me that it would be on the bland side, so I ordered it extra spicy and it ended up coming out perfect.  Our Ramen was bomb, the agadashi tofu was on-point, and the tempura was decent.  I would recommend substituting the buckwheat noodles because the ramen was kinda meh.  My friends were horrified at how bright red with spices my soup was, and were convinced that was why I wasn't enthralled by the flavors of the ramen noodles.

They at least have reasonable price and bright light that let me at least understand what food served in front of me.\n\nPEOPLE:\nMisleading, immature, nonprofessional. The waitress came to ask \"Ready to order?\" every 30 sec. Misleading answer for the question  about which ramen x don can be a combo. She just said \"You can choose anything !\"  - but actually not. We ended up paying $5 more than expected. Chatting among them most of the time so we kept staring at them to get their attention for 3 min in that tiny store.\n\nIf you know how the ramen is either in NY or Japan - ha, don't bother, they are surprisingly Japanese own restaurant, but with no proud.", "author": "M O."}

I was on a time limit so I had to down that bowl asap! Lots of ppl had their eyes on me since I was slurping the shit out of that bowl. I'll say it again, it was very delicious. I quickly paid for everything and left the restaurant and came to the parking meter to find that it just turned from \"0 minutes\" to the flashing red \"expired\".

We had to wait about 20-30 mins for a table, just past noon.  Slowly and surely, a small crowd gathers outside the restaurant and more names are added to the outside sign-up list.  A testament to the power of Yelp, I overheard 4 young ladies waiting, remark about how one of them learned about this place thru a friend via Yelp.  \n\nWith John Legend music playing in the background, Hubs and I dined on 2 pieces of hamachi nigiri ($5) which was disappointing. The hamachi was not as good as what we enjoyed the night before at Yoshi's Oakland and the rice immediately fell apart while hubby tried to dip it into the soyu.  My katanaya ramen ($12.90), the costliest of the ramens (others range $8.50-$9.80), was not great either. I had the miso broth and found it salty and oily from the 2 pieces of fried chicken karage and 2 fried vegt. gyoza.  There was chopped spinach, some kind of gourd? which had a displeasing odor, 1/2 an egg, corn and a slice of pork in the soup.  The ramen was OK, not great.  We tried the fried calamari legs served over a very small spring salad. The batter didn't adhere to the calamari but tasted good with the mayonnaise-like dipping sauce.  There's a sushi bar which seats about 4 persons.  Seems to be a popular place for the younger set and has great hours for night owls as they're opened until 1:15AM daily.

We ordered both the Katana-Ya special with rich miso and rich soy sauce broths. This special consisted of butter corn, fried chicken, fried gyoza, chasu pork, green onion, and bamboo shoots. It's basically their ramen bowl with everything and the \"kitchen sink.\" While this special was very toppings heavy, it worked well with the very flavorful broths (both the miso and soy were complex and flavorful). The service was also friendly. Why not 5 stars? The noodles were okay...we favor the chewier and curlier shaped version. This version is straight and thin like vermicelli. The noodle's thinness changes the texture and body of the chew. The broths were very tasty but also are made with MSG (they state this on their menus. Why do they need this shortcut?). Lastly, they have red pepper flakes on each table but it lacked any punch. I must have put 2 teaspoons of it in my bowl and it barely registered any spiciness. If I was around SF and Union Square, I would go back and try some other choices. Overall, good and solid ramen experience but it lags far behind Ramen Dojo and Orenchi.", "author": "H E."}

Probably, chijire-men (stronger noodle) would be better match for its strong broth. I like it al dente but noodle with poor quality doesn't make much difference how it's cooked.\n\nTopping: Chashu (BBQ Pork) is too thin and too small.

A little light on the vegetables for my taste, but I'm sure they'd be happy to add them upon request. \n\nI didn't try the sushi, but the tuna behind the glass on the counter was the size of a log and the color of flipping-this-morning. I may never taste it. Who needs sushi when the noodles are so divine?!", "author": "Denise B."}

If you do go, keep a sharp eye out, Katana-Ya is pretty easy place to miss. My only gripe is occasionally the waitress staff isn't always on top of things. Even when its slow, they aren't always there for you when you need them. \n\nOverall, its a good place to grab lunch when you're at Union Square if you're in the mood for some Japanese and don't want to hop all the way to J-town or the pseudo Japanese restaurants in the malls.", "author": "Ivan M."}

Good choice! =) I love ramen, especially when there isn't a lot of msg in it. You choose your own broth- miso, soy sauce, and....house broth (?). Then there are the different combo ramens to choose from. I decided on the fried chicken ramen with miso broth. Basically it was Karaage and ramen...and something else which I can't remember. I do remember though that is was delish!!! The ramen was chewy and tasted fresh. The fried chicken stayed crispy for the longest time...until I devoured it all...of course =). The broth was perfect and not bland or too salty. It was yumilicious! =)...yes, I made this word up! My friend had the house special (?), which is basically everything, but the kitchen sink and asked for kim chee with it.  I should've asked for kim chee with mine too, but I figured it might be too much. I just added the hot pepper which was good enough for me. One thing I was worried about eating ramen was the MSG. I get a bad reaction from MSG. Very bad headache and bloatedness....not good!! Thank God I didn't have any side effects after eating here, so either they don't add MSG or just very, very little! In any case, their ramen was good eats!!! =)...YUM!!!", "author": "Neni E."}

I had read there were longs waits and was glad we arrived during an off time. We both ordered the fried chicken ramen with miso broth (thanks yelpers for the recommendation) and the crispy tuna roll. The tuna roll was a sushi roll with no rice, fried in a tempura batter and served on top of salad greens with a mayo dressing. It was okay but I was saving my appetite for the main meal. The soup came out in 10 minutes and it was heaven. The broth was warm and flavorful, the chicken was tender but crunchy and the noodles were a perfect al dente. It was everything I wanted and more!

It's directly across from the Curran Theatre, smushed next to Colibri's.  \nIt was all about the Ramen tonite - one of those freakin' WINDY San Francisco evenings. You could be walking along just fine, then hit a wind tunnel and OH MY !#@$&*! GAWD IT'S !@#*% COLD!\nRamen being ramen, it's nothing mind-blowing, but I thought Katana-Ya has the best noodles I've had in my limited experience.  Their ramen's a smidgen thicker than at Tanpopo's or Genki, and quite flavorful all on its own.  I was kinda disappointed at their small selection of 5 or so ramen soup options, though their menu was packed with many other bento stuff, cooked apps and sushi.   I'd like to come back and try their other broth options of miso & salt.  While I thought my soy broth, light version, was already pretty oily and flavorful, my companions didn't think it was salty enough and poured, POURED more soy in! Wow.  \nContrary to it's description - the fried tuna app is a salad, with some tempura battered tuna pieces.  Gyoza was pretty good, too, more cabbage than meat, but tasty.\nService wasn't bad, but wasn't stellar either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-09", "description": "Disappointing.  OK, the broth (I got miso) was genuinely excellent.  Hot, rich, not too salty.  Despite being miso it wasn't overwhelmingly fishy because it was (I think) a pork-based broth.  I tend to find things that tasty fishy that arent fish a little fishy  I don't like bonito flakes, for example.  Since they (sometimes) use bonito flakes to make miso, you might think that me ordering the miso broth in the first place is a little fishy itself, but I digress.\n\nSo anyway, the broth was good.  That's a good start.  If only the noodles didn't fuck it up.  (I bet the broth is pretty pissed right now.)  I'm willing to cut the noodles some slack though since I think it's mainly personal taste.  I like mine a little thicker and more QQ, as the chinese would say, which  am totally justified in using to describe this Japanese place since they call their bbq pork \"cha siu\"...so there.  It's not that they weren't chewy or properly prepared, but just they were pretty thin so there wasn't much bite to the texture.\n\nMy main complaint?  No kakuni (stewed pork)! Kakuni is without a doubt the best thing you can put in ramen.  It's genuinely a hard decision for me whether I'd rather have ramen without noodles or ramen without kakuni.  For those not paying attention, btw, ramen == noodles == delicious == mr pibb + red vines - crazy. \n\nIn case you've never eaten ramen before, let me describe the process for you.  They hand you a bowl with some yellow broth in it.  There's probably some stuff on top of the broth.  Steam is drifting into your face.  If you're in Japan there might be a separate bowl of noodles, but otherwise the noodles are probably already in the bowl.  So you take your chopsticks and you're like GIVE ME FOOD and you stuff some noodles into your face.  And you're like \"yum, comfort food\".  Then you're like \"me man.  me eat meat.  me grow strong like bull\" and you go in for the roast pork.  You eat the pork and you feel your body breaking down the protein and building your massive muscles.  Then you're like \"me man.  me eat MORE meat\" and you see the stewed pork in your bowl.  You eat the stewed pork.  Then you think \"holy shit, that roast pork pork was tough as fuck compared to these tender, delicious, wonderful, perfect, beautiful, amazing stewed pork\".  Then there's a lot more eating, some love making to the stewed pork, and some sipping of the broth to make sure you don't finish too quickly.\n\nSo you see, when you take away the kakuni from ramen, it's sort of like hanging out with your girlfriend but taking away the part where you have sex.  And it's like, even if your girlfriend is smart and funny and you like everything about her, are you really going to stay with her when you could just go find another one and get laid every time you wanted?\n\nNo. you're not.  You're going to get your kakuni.  Even if you have to pay a little extra.\n\nP.S. No, I'm not a shallow bastard, but I didn't say what I would do in that situation.  I said that's what *you* would do, you sexist pig.", "author": "Jack S."}

But I read some reviews on Yelp, and it looks like it could give me some surprise...  \n\nI tried \"Kotteri Miso Ramen\", which is \"Rich\" \"Miso Flavored\" Ramen.  (You have a choice between Rich or Light, but I like my ramens always rich, or even greasy...) and wow!  It was THE BEST RAMEN IN THE US SO FAR.  \n\nI was awfully disappointed at ramens in the US so far.  I found some great sushi restaurants but this culture is still not very wide-spread in the US.  And I can understand why: \n\n1) Ramens have to be served very hot - almost you could burn your tongue\n2) Ramens have to be eaten very quickly - otherwise the noodle gets soggy in the soup\n3) Ramens are considered as the stuff you can buy at Walmart for 20 cents, like Maruchan (it's too bad that this is also a Japanese company too.  They only thought about making money rather than spreading the real culture) \n\nSo yeah, this Katana-ya had all of above.  Again so far the best ramen I've ever had in this country, although it's not as good as ones in Japan.  To me it's great.  You should go there if you appreciate this huge culture from Japan.  If you have been to Japan and you miss real ramen, you should check out this place very near Union Square.  \n\nI did not try their sushi and I don't even feel like trying - because for me this place became a ramen-ya.  The decor is very ugly but I can understand that considering the price of ramens here.  (But still it's a bit amazing to me that they have lamp shades made of aluminum foils!!!)  To make the real broth like this, you have to cook so many things in the soup for a long time until everything melts into it.  You don't see any vegetables, meat, fish or bones in the soup but you will only feel the depth of the flavors from all the ingredients!  \n\nNow Tanpopo in Japantown is completely dead in me.

Being the only voice of reason, I calmed everyone down, and thankfully nothing unfolded that night (in fact, we ended up giving them a pretty fat tip). \n\nNeedless to say, I will be back. What, then, was the purpose of this review you say? I write this review in hopes that the other party who sat at our table reads this. If you didn't notice, we had our food served before you. In fact, we were done with eating before your entire party had received your food. Yea, take that.", "author": "eric h."}

The usual choices across from the Curran Theater for something quick and easy were: Quiznos, Pizza by the Slice, Jack in the Box.. already the thought of eating any of those made me feel my leggings getting tighter!  Thankfully, we noticed the group of folks waiting outside of Katana-Ya (including a bunch of Nike Women's Marathon finishers... I wish I did it too, darn!) and the sign for \"Best Ramen 2008 in SF\" (I'd also say 2009 ;).  Time restrait or not, we HAD to eat it. \nTIME CHECK: 40 min til' show time, we took the risk and asked for a table for two. Although the place is rather small and there was about 5 \"party of twos\"  in front of us, we were able to get seated rather quickly in 15 min or so. \nTIME CHECK: 25 min til' show time. We decided to share a Spicy Green Onion Ramen. w/ Rich Miso Broth... (they had the usual broth types as well: Shoyu, Salt, Miso.. light or rich). We also asked for extra pork and a side of Gyoza. We got all the food in about 10 min..\nTIME CHECK: 15 min til' show time...and the marathon grubfest began. I'm a ramen snob, so for me to say the ramen was awesome, says a lot. The spicyness was perfect, not over-powering (they do have a Super Spicy Ramen or something like that that I seen and was really red). The pork slices just melted in your mouth and not too much fat nor any bit of dryness. The gyoza was average... nothing special.. and was $6 for 5 pieces, so a bit pricey for what it is. The ramen I think was $9, but came up a little more since we added the extra meat. No big deal.. still a great value for good ass food. We sat there satisfied and asked for the check. Service was prompt and very friendly... \nTIME CHECK: 5 min until show time... We dashed across the street, got to our seats w/ 2 min left until curtain-call and enjoyed the show, full and warm from Katana-Ya =) \n\nNext time, I'd like to try the Katana-Ya Ramen and also the Chirashi which looked nice and fresh.. We must go back very soon so I can sit there and take my time to enjoy each slurp and bite of the yummy broth and noodles vs. scarfing it down like a maniac!  If the gyoza were good, I would have given a 5.. but since we only ordered 2 things and 50% of the food was only average.. had to bring it down to a 4 or maybe 4.5 even... One last note: they are open until 1:15am.. so great for a late-night meal.. esp. after the bars/clubs.

They ask the waiter if they could do the same to their tables and the waitress said \"NO we dont do that here\" We felt bad for the two pregos so my friends and I decided to give them our table and move to the corner table in front of the cashier.  The table was so tiny that the food we ordered didnt even fit.(we ordered chicken karage for appetizer and three bowls or ramen)  The waitress didnt even say sorry or thanked us for accomodating their customers.  To top all that she was really bitter and mean...no smiles! I flag  her  for some drinks and she totally ignored us.

The service is functional, if not friendly; they get to you when they can, and once they've given you your food you seem to evaporate from their worldview altogether until you ask to pay your bill. \n\nThe food could really be the saving grace of a place like this. Problem is, it isn't. The last time I went there I ordered the Katana-Ya Ramen. What came to my table was a steaming bowl of ramen cunningly concealed beneath a 1/4\" layer of oil, all of which was topped with a gaggle of meats fried into unrecognizable greasy brown hunks. I tried to eat it, taking two sips of the greasy 'broth' and a bite of one of the brown hunks perched atop the mass of stewed noodles, but the greasy texture and abysmal flavor made my gut churn. The noodles were rubbery and bland, the broth tasted like old Crisco, and the other bits and pieces in there were pretty much cooked well beyond edibility. I called the waitress over and asked if I could just have a regular old Shoyu Ramen instead, to which she replied, \"But you ordered THAT!\" When I finally convinced her to bring me another ramen, it too was covered with a layer of grease and the broth was clotted and odd-looking. I took a few bites of it, but it was almost as inexplicably poor as the first ramen I'd ordered. I paid for everything and left the restaurant still hungry.\n\nI love ramen, but I'm no expert. Still, when I order one the last thing I expect to get is clotted bowl of oil and chewy noodles. I've had better ramen out of a baggie.", "author": "Kele T."}

Go there and you can't go wrong with the food.\n\nBut anyway, on my second trip I appreciated the decor a bit more too as the meal proceeded. The room only fits like 10 tables and it creates a narrow pathway for the waitresses to move around. The chef looks like he's really Japanese, but I didn't want to make conversation with him. There is a counter for patrons to eat ramen in and behind the counter they hung a giant gilded Japanese screen. It was actually gorgeous and I felt it out of place for a Japanese restaurant. What made it even more weird were the christmas lights and the gaudy halogen light bars. I wasn't sure if I was in a Tokyo street vendor or an esoteric Japanophile's basement. There actually was a pair of Katana blades there too. To complete the look they should've added a train set like Izakaya Mai's.

We supplemented that with the katana ya ramen bowl; both had the miso soup broth. \n\nThe miso soup borth was very rich, almost too rich. I think HALU in SF is still my favorite. 3 stars. \n\nThe ramen here is sooo good though! +1 for the noddles. Perfectly cooked, not soft or mushy, and not too hard and chewy. \n\nThe thing I  liked most was actually the beef sukiyaki. It was great!

But after eating here i realize i was seriously mislead. The soup and quality of the ramen were delicious, and totally worth the $10 that i could use to buy a whole months worth of ramen for. The ramen had a nice thick and chewy texture. The soup options are either Miso or Soy, which are both good, and you can either get them light or rich (meaning \"more flavor\" says our waitress). \nOne things that could use some improvement is the amount of meat. I was done with all the karaage in my ramen in the first couple minutes. Second, DON\"T go with big groups. I would say it's good for couples only. I went with 4 other people and the wait was 40 minutes outside in the cold. Maybe that's the trick to making their ramen taste so good.

This is the spot to go to if you've been hanging around downtown all day or plan on hanging around downtown after dinner.  The only 2 complaints I would have is how crowded and small the restaurant is and that their spicy tuna is a bit too fishy for me.  Maybe it wasn't seasoned enough.  I'm a lover of raw fish but this happened to be a bit much for me.  After my first failed experience with sushi with them, I decided to just stick to their main staple, ramen.  Their delicious salty thick broth and fresh ramen noodles have yet failed me.  I frequent the spot usually during cold winter nights because going all the way to downtown to eat during a regular day doesn't appeal to me.  I like checking out downtown during Christmas so I can shop, check out the sights, and then have a big bowl of hot ramen!  They also let you customize your ramen so that you can choose what type of soup, ramen, and meat you want.  I always get the heavy broth 'cause I like having hearty noodle soup.  They have a large variety of different types of ramen and I keep getting the original with chashu.  The kimchee ramen looks promising and adding deep fried chicken to your ramen seems so wrong but it tastes so right at Katana-Ya!  I'd eat a piece of my friends chicken everytime she gets it but I'm still going to stick to my chashu.\n\nI'd recommend this spot for small get togethers and dinner dates, maybe not a first date though because it is a bit noisy with the crowd and all but it's a really fun and lively environment.  \n\nPros: Yummy FRESH ramen for decent price\nCons: Gets crowded, long waits\n\nIt's located next to a few different parking garages so if you can't find parking on the street, which is more than likely, you can park in the garage.

I was nauseated by the smell of fish (I despise the look, smell and taste of fish) when my meal arrived. FYI- it is not OK to pile a glob of stanky seaweed on an otherwise tasty dish just because you have some in the kitchen.  My advice to Japanese restaurant owners: if a customer orders a non-fish meal from a restaurant that mainly serves fish (hello? Japanese=sushi) then it's probably safe to say that that particular customer doesn't want any fish or fish-smelling items. At least the waitress could've asked me first. To all fellow fish-haters: beware of Katana-Ya! p.s. I don't hate fish, I just hate being forced to smell and/or eat them.", "author": "Melissa B."}

Yeah, sounds gross but if you're a real farmer working from sunrise to sunset, you need this amount of fat to last the day of labor. But, since many are now pale barely exercising office workers, it means NO deluxe broth but yes to the basic which is mostly skimmed. I find on weekends, there's little more fat floating around than I want so I avoid weekend dining here. It's nice that it's open till 2am. \nPortions are not as generous as I would like so I add $2 for extra noodles. I love these al dente noodles. J-town has more Ramen restaurants but a lot of them pre-cook the noodles to be able to quickly serve them which results in a mushy noodle. THis place is generally  cook to order. The pork is nothing to rave about and personally, I'd rather have some thing else instead in the basic. Basic is a few bamboo shoots, 1 slice of pork, green onions and some other stuff. Light on toppings, rich on flavor. I can no longer eat the watery broths at my former favorite ramen places in J-town now that I've learned of Katana-Ya from Yelp. Lunch combos are OK but go up a few more dollars for dinner. For that I'd rather dine on noodles ala carte and spend the $6-8 side item fee grazing on another item in another place later or on another entire meal at the nearby King of Thai. The chef brags about his gyoza being the best. It's very fresh cabbage, still sharp with sulfur (that's how fresh it is) with the thinnest of gyoza skins and tasty bites. The salmon flower for lunch is 4 slices with a small bowl of rice which complements a basic ramen nicely. So I recommend the ramen because the noodles are cooked to order and al dente. If you're not sure about ramen, watch the foodie film Tanpoppo sometime. It's a hilarious search for the perfect bowl of ramen. For staff, you gotta realize it's efficient but not super. No traditional follow up checks after the food is delivered to your table. If you need anything else, just get the server's attention. No goodbyes, no thank yous, heck, I usually see them turn their back on the entrance. However, richly flavored al dente ramen soup is what you do get. If you're friends, then you also get more smiles.", "author": "L P."}

The tempura was pretty good too although next time I would rather pick something else, maybe the kimuchi fried rice or something.  The california rolls my fellow yelper had wasn't all that great.  I won't deduct any stars for that since only noobs order california rolls at a place that's known for ramen!  Well she had the ramen too.  \n\n-1 star for unattentive service.  My water needed refilling!\n\nI'm sure Naruto would give this about four stars too.  He'd probably take away half a star for lacking the swirly fish cake things and maybe another half a star for the lack of the egg.  I think the ramen place in J-town actually has those.

After that disclaimer I can say, I think this is the best ramen place in San Fancisco.  I have not had the chance to go to Santa Ramen but thats not really in San Francisco so i can still  claim that Katana-ya has the best ramen in the city. \n I went with my boyfriend who doesn't really have or understand the \"Asian craving\" for a bowl of noodles in soup.  For some reason he never understands my extreme desire to have a bowl of noodles in delicious broth, but he faithfully takes the trip with me to this hole in the wall to have the mouth watering dish of my culinary desire.  I explained to him that there are 2 types of broth rich and light.  For those health conscious and/or for those who gets nauseous at the sight of fat, do not order the rich broth.  The light broth is a little less fatty and oily but equally tasty.  I prefer the rich broth myself and ordered the perfect lunch combo of maguro don and rich shoyu ramen.  The bf had the tonkatsu don and rich shoyu ramen combo.  \nThey first brought out the tonkatsu don and maguro don which were both absolutely delicious and was at our table almost as soon as we ordered it.  The tuna was very fresh and the sushi rice was perfect!  After inhaling these two dishes, they brought out the object of my desire, and like pavlov's dog i was salivating at the sight of the bowls coming to our table.  My only disappointment was that it did not come with an egg or green onions!  I can live without having the sprouts, but i was almost shocked when i didn't see the egg and green onions.  But as i tasted the broth i forgot my gripe with the missing ingredients and was immediately placated by the delicious liquid.  \nThe house made noodles only added to my satisfaction.  They were perfectly al dente and had the right color of well made noodles!  \nThe total for this meal for two was just $22.50 not including tip.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE\nThis place deserves 5 stars in my book Sill haven't been to tokyo but Katana-Ya and tokyo ramen places can't be compared (had a brain fart )....seriously, because I pinky swear that i ate here 4 nights in a row with different friends (not too many people i know love ramen like i do), and got the same regular ramen and maguro don combo, and i could have gone back for a 5th night.

I was about to get into my car and drive across the bridge to to go to Katana-Ya when she brought me a mug of hot green tea. The green tea totally satiated my desire for hot Japanese soup so we went for just sushi instead. I ordered a bowl of Udon and it was craptacular. The sushi was great though. Yesterday, I drove in to work, and while walking towards Zeum, I felt that craving for Ramen so I turned around, walked up the block and then turned around again when I remembered why I was in the city and that I really needed to go to Zeum to check on things there. I made it half way down the block, and my cravings kicked in again so I turned around, walked back up the block and then kicked myself for being so impulsive and turned around again. I made two complete circles on Mason Street.

I guess we were the first ones to be waiting because it would be 10-15 minutes of torturously salivating at everyone's food while standing awkwardly where there really is no room to stand.  If it weren't raining, I'd have made a quickie shopping trip a couple blocks down to Union Square.  Finally seated, we didn't receive a ricebowl menu, but hearing about the Uni-don, I inquired about it.  The uni was on the special menu....and according to a supposed \"fresh fish market days\" rumor I'd heard, it wasn't a good day to eat sushi, so I opted for the Katanaya ramen with rich miso.  Girlfriend 1 got Tonketsu ramen with soy broth, girlfriend 2 got the spicy green onion with light salt broth.  \n\nKatanaya:   Sizzling hot gyoza!!!  I resent you for burning off my taste buds so everything else tasted painfully dulled!!  Sigh.   I could still tell everything was pretty good..but oddly, the richest broth (mine) was the most bland.  The spicy green onion was good--just  t he right amount of spiciness and saltiness.  Tonketsu..was OK.  I don't think I'm into the whole dipping thing.  Piling noodles neatly into a spoon then balancing it with just the right amount of broth until i can catch the whole thing with my mouth without leaving a trailing piece of noodle sticking out is enough work.  Dipping noodles confuses me..how much soupiness is the right amount for the right taste!?  shrug.  \n\nAnyway, the only thing about this place is that it's SO small..conversations become contagious.  As in, we would be talking about something or other, and then later the table (very)next to us would strangely adopt the same topic.  Granted we were eavesdropping too in order to catch that but....still.  Kinda awkward.  Not a place for intimate conversation I guess.  \n\nPlanning on returning here again for the sushi and some other type of ramen something reallllly soon.  Prices are friendly.

The space inside is extremely small and only holds about 8ish small tables. I had very high expectations for this place since the boyfriend kept raving about it, but I was slightly disappointed.

It practically melted in my mouth and I've never had anything like it at any other ramen place. The broth (miso) was okay, and the noodles were okay.

I had been introduced to that by my cousin Andy who lived right around the corner and whom I was insanely jealous of since he lived in such close proximity to taste heaven. I would order the Yokozuna which was the special and it was enormous, being filled with pork, gyoza, chicken karaage, bamboo shoots etc. etc. It was simply an amazing meal.\n\nNow why am I talking about that place in this review? Because it is now CLOSED!!! I was horrified when I heard that it had closed and I did not believe I could mourn the passing of good food. But I did. \n\nWhile searching a couple months ago for ramen places, I came across this thread on Chowhound that mentioned that the owners had moved to Geary which brings me to the present. \n\nUpon further reading, I was seized with the desire to find out if this was indeed the place on Judah. I met up with M for lunch who as usual was wondering why I was dragging her to a different place for food. Once we got there, I looked with great anticipation through the menu. I was disappointed to see that the menu was different but no matter, I decided to order the tonkotsu ramen (light) and M ordered the miso ramen. \n\nOnce the food arrived, we dug in. Up to this point, I had never seen M remain completely silent while eating her meal. All I got out of her was \"This is soooooooooo goood!\" \n\nVerdict? I am not sure if this is the successor to the Judah place (5 stars definitely) but it's not the same thing. It is greasier and to top it off I was not able to order the Yokozuna.

When you walk in, the first thing you think is that the place is small. The next thing you notice is the customers are all speaking Japanese. This was my first time, but realize that Katana Ya is nowhere near J-town (that's Japantown to you). I ordered the mabo miso ramen which is what I'm currently fixated on in all Japanese food. The tofu was done to perfection (not over heated and not too soft), and the spicy hotness was just hot enough to make you sweat. It may come as a surprise if you think of ramen as an instant meal from your college days, but this is serious stuff. I look for a good noodle dish wherever I'm eating and this place is doing it well. I opted for the \"rich\" broth over the \"light\". I recommend the former if you like your ramen salty, the miso was full flavored and tasted homemade. The noodles were chewy enough, but not underdone. I opted out of the \"combo\" for something like $0.50 more, but I should not have missed out. My buds went for it, I wasn't hungry. The extra change gets you a small bowl of rice with your choice of a small entree, like tempura, or cutlet, sushi ($), typical Japanese appetizer-entree selections. The choices are many and varied. I gave it four stars, because I'm a fan of Suzue, but this place is Japan-legit. \n\nOne minus: the location isn't a place where you can find street parking, so it helps to be in Union Sq. for shopping and coincidentally drop in. Sutter Stockton is nearby, so no big deal. There's plenty of other garages, too.", "author": "Patrick L."}

The staff was incompetent and very rude to us when our ENTIRE order came incorrect. We ordered tekka roll and asked for the rice on the outside. We also ordered soba noodle miso with BBQ pork. First a small bowl of rice came out and we thought \"oh, the noodles must come with a side of rice\" and dug in while we waited. A sushi roll came- not a tekka roll, but something quite elaborate with fish on top a \"katana roll\". We told them it wasn't ours (assuming maybe someone else ordered it). They insisted that's what we ordered and it took about five different people coming over to convince them we ordered a tekka roll. Meanwhile, our noodles came and they brought soy sauce based broth (which I cannot eat because of a gluten intolerance). We again corrected them. This time the manager(?) came over and was VERY annoyed with us insisting that this is what we ordered. He repeated our entire order that the waiter had written down as \"katana roll, soy sauce bbq pork soba noodles, and a side of rice.\" We corrected the order and told him we hadn't ordered rice, but it just came and we assumed it was complimentary. He reached across the table and snatched the half eaten bowl of rice, \"I'll take that!\" and walked away in a huff. When the tekka roll finally arrived, it was not rice on the outside and the roll was filled with almost a tablespoon of wasabi (inside!). It was inedible. After one painful bite, we got up and said to cancel our order because we were unhappy with the customer service and our order was still wrong. The manager yelled at us, arguing that we still had to pay for the tekka roll because we took a bite. As we left, not 4 minutes since we'd corrected the order, our new soup was coming out of the kitchen (how on earth could they possibly have remade it that quickly?!) We threw $6 on the table and walked out. Rudest wait staff I've ever experienced. Nasty food. Horrible all over.", "author": "Sarah N."}

No way I'm standing out in the cold for 30+ mins for some ramen.  We went and tried Asuka up the street. That was my first non-top-ramen, and it was plenty tasty.\nYesterday I decided to try Katana ya for an early dinner. No line, 1/2 empty. Cramped in there for sure. Ordered the katanaya of which everyone writes. Yeah, unhealthy soup for sure. 2 little pcs. fried chicken, 2 gyoza, a slice of pork (didn't seem bbq'd), and 1/2 an egg.  In a miso broth. First they bring me one with a spicy chili broth, which I definitely didn't order. Okay. The place starts filling up.\nMy correct soup arrives. It's nothing special. It's actually quite a disappointment after all the raves here. Wtf? It's ramen noodles with some fried and fatty foods dropped in it. The gyoza were good, as far as soggy fried foods go (they're in soup, of course they got soggy!). The fried chicken was fried. and it was chicken. The egg was actually not very good for some reason. Odd texture.\nI'm kinda complaining for two reasons: 1) does NOT live up to the yelp hype and (perhaps more importantly) 2) the PRICE!  OMG!  A bowl of noodle soup with small amount of fried appetizer-type food in it cost $14 with tax. with tip I paid $16+ for a bowl of ramen?? \nAnd what REALLY gets me is that Asuka's ramen, with more pork but sans the fried bits, cost about $6.50. It was a bigger bowl. It was actually much more satisfying. \nWHY are people raving about the katana ya ramen? I don't know. No, I've not been to Japan and I'm not a ramen officianado, but damn if anyone can justify waiting in the cold for 30+ mins just to spend $14 on a bowl of fried chicken noodle soup that only rises to the level of \"ok.\"", "author": "Allucaneat G."}

I gave 4-stars because this is a Ramen place and the shoyu Ramen with Char Sui I had was excellent.  Stick to the basics and this noodle shop will not disappoint.", "author": "Kenneth N."}

It was like 10-15 feet wide and maybe 50 feet long and the chef cooking area took up about 40% of that space so i'll leave it to you to figure out how much space is left. we came on a thursday night around 8pm and only had to wait 15 minutes for a 2 person table though.\n\nalso i think they really like beyonce at this joint cuz they played her entire triple platinum 2006 B'Day cd. also they played michael jackson...im not too sure to take off or add a star for these choices. i guess it was cool since i was tempted to dance and eat my noodles at the same time.", "author": "Varun .."}

A table of 5 of us had to wait 30+ minutes for a table on Sunday night, which would have been fine if the waitresses had been nice about it.  But after we waited for the table of 6 before us to finish, the waitress tried to split up the 2 tiny tables that had pushed together for the previous group of 6 and make the 5 of us sit at one.  All of us just chuckled at the ridiculousness because I don' t think 5 ramen bowls would even have fit. Then after one of my friends asked if we could push the tables back together, she tried to argue with us, then rushed off to talk to another server, complaining in Japanese about us.

I am a big fan of ramen and Japanese food in general so after reading all the reviews, I decided to check this place out. Katana-ya was easy to find, located at the corner of Geary and Mason. The place itself is very small, crowded...  Decorations are simple. The food is DELICIOUS. Anything from chicken karaage to monk fish liver, you can find a variety of dishes that suite your palate. The rolls are great, the ramen is one of the best I've ever had! Try the spicy option if you can handle spicy! Katana ya also offers a variety of sake and beers at reasonable prices. The place also opens late which makes it a perfect spot for some late night after going to the bars. Over all, I have to say Katana ya is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants!

If so, then can I order a pot of bowling water, a bowl and a request to not throw me out while i cook my packaged ramen in your restaurant?\n\nI went with a couple of friends because she loves this place and I will try anything new once and since she's like a crazy food critic, i knew this place would be good. As we got there I asked her to help me order, because i'm not really picky about ramen, so she ordered me a miso, bbq with egg. Before i got my ramen, i had the chance to try out their chicken katsu lookalike and it was badass. The chicken had a wonderful flavor with just enough salt and spices and the sauce was tasty. The butterfish was also really good and everything else was delicious. Okay now i've been waiting for about 20min and i still haven't gotten my ramen. My friends are either done eating or almost done eating. Another few minutes later my ramen came and my eyes gleamed up. Woohoo, ramen finally i yelled out (well i didn't really yell but i was happy inside like a kid playing in the snow fields, or playing with needles and fire, depending on how your childhood was) I took my first bite and --------------wat the hell was this? The soup was just salty, it doesn't really have flavor, it was just salty and the noodles was undercooked so every bite was like a tug o war. I just ate the bbq pork which i thought would look like the red chinese ones because i loved those and that's about it. I left the undercooked noodles to dine in hell with the salty mixture of water, some blackness and buckets of evil known as salt.

I love the grilled salmon don (comes in small or regular). I usually get the regular cause' I'm a girl with a big appetite =). It's crunchy and you get this taste of ginger. I don't know what they put, but I'm hooked on it. Another thing to try is their e x t r a spicy ramen!! If you like spice, go for it!! It tastes so good with the miso broth and the one piece of meat they give you, the best f***ing meat I have ever tasted!! I like sitting at the bar too, makes you feel cool. I give this a four star because sometimes they forget to give us menus and take awhile to get our order, but it's understandable because they can get real busy. Also, they don't have salmon t e r i ya k i!! Like c'mon, what kind of Japanese restaurant does not do salmon teriyaki? It's like the one thing you can't ever miss seeing on the menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-09-18", "description": "Stopped in here for some allegedly great ramen soup - blech, was I disappointed.  I ordered the tsukemen and edamame.  The edamame was OK, nothing special.  To me, when a restaurant is actually making an effort the edamame is served slightly warm with a little soy or salt on it.  This was just cold and plain.  But I can live with that.\n\nThe Tsukemen was very disappointing.  This dish is served with noodles and chicken in one bowl, and the broth in another with a hard boiled egg.  The broth was GREASY and heavy (imagine the brothy goop you get when you roast your thanksgiving turkey, and you have to separate the grease from the good stuff to make your gravy - this broth was like the pre-strained version of that).  I couldn't really taste the broth flavor beyond the greasy taste. The noddles were in a big clump in the bowl, which made it very difficult to get a bite sized piece to dip in the broth.  Even after picking up a clump and getting it in the bowl, it was very hard to get an edible sized portion without splashing broth everywhere.  The \"chicken\" was pretty much an unidentifiable looking piece of deep fried something or other.  As for that hard boiled egg, how the heck are you supposed to eat a hard-boiled egg with just a pair of chop sticks and a spoon?\n\nOverall, this dish left me with a pit in my stomach even after eating only a third of it.  It was so greasy I had to go get a frozen yogurt just to cut the greasy feel in my mouth (then brushed my teeth when I got back to the office).  \n\nThe topper was the guy squeezed in elbow to elbow with me at the bar, slurping his noodles with great noisy abandon.\n\nYuk, I won't try this place again.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

If ever there was a Wednesday that felt like a HUMP day, yesterday was one for the record books. From the weather, to the long work day, to the people not understanding the rules of the road (\"Dude, that was the 3rd time that SAME taxi has been circling the block with us and cut us off!\"), it just FELT like, well, .... that people were getting humped in one form or another.\n\nMy friend, (Ben T.) and I stumbled into this little hole in the wall establishment on the recommendation of one of my other ramen loving friends, (Kevin M.)\n(I converted him from the idea of instant \"ramen\" via Santa ramen and Sapporo-Ya)\n\nAs soon as we walked up to the place, there was a group of 8-9 folks loitering in the front and conversing in Japanese. Not a bad sign in my book, especially for in front of a Ramen place.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, my glasses fogged up (serves me right for not wearing the contacts yesterday) and I was bombasted by a cacophony of conversation. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, at least, it meant the place was full of people, and they were happily shooting the breeze. As soon as I cleared my lenses of the steam, I peered around to check out the crowd, and was pleasantly surprised to see the dining folk were as diverse as the people waiting outside for the 38 Line headed home. (except without the whole body odor and urine smell).\n\nA waitress swam over to us (literally, she did that whole, across the body crawl stroke past a customer or two in the packed place, and asked how many of us there was, and promptly offered seating at the bar. \n\nAfter figuring that two of the items were deep fried, I just went with the salt broth, instead of the miso and soy based. Double checking with Ben about what he was going to get he decided to get the same ramen, but with miso, since he enjoys its savoriness\n\nAnyways, when the waitress came by, she brought out some tea, napkins and chopsticks for us. In doing so, she accidentally poured some tea on poor Ben (he'd been havin' a craptacular day up to this point) and walked away. Ben proceeded to conspiratorially lean over and whisper, \"She spilled some tea on me.\" I leaned over to dead-pan, \"Maybe she likes you.\" At this point, the same waitress ninja'd over and started to dab at Ben's pants with a couple of napkins and apologized while smiling at him. Funny how that works.\n\nWe ended up getting two Katanaya Ramens, one with salt broth, the other with miso, the spicy tuna roll, the spicy salmon roll, and the regular salmon roll. (What, I was hungry, sheesh)\n\nAs we returned to our deep conversation about life, work, and girls (What?!), we watched the sushi chef receive our order and get to work.\nLiterally 3 minutes later, (about 6 minutes from when our order was taken), our rolls were ready, and the chef looked confused as we looked up expectantly at our rolls until the waitress pointed down the bar at us, and the chef handed down or dish of sushi. Before we could start on THAT, our ramen came out. Talk about speediness. Awesome.\n\nAfter we started digging in, I started to take apart the bowl of noodles in front of me. \nI saw the fried chicken and started with that (I hate how soggy deep fried things get after sitting in the broth, what would the point of deep frying it if it gets soggy in the broth. I had experienced the deep fried chicken at a few of the other ramen places (Genki, Santa, etc etc) and hands down, I liked this one right off the bat. It was crispy (until the broth got to it -sigh-), the chicken was juicy, not fried dried, and the batter didn't taste funky. I killed the dumplings next. \nThey were tasty in their own right, but alas were soggy already. Admittedly, I couldn't identify the meat mix inside by taste and texture, but it was still tasty, and at that point I didn't really care anymore. \nThe sliced pork was succulent, juicy, and all around tasty with a bit of fat across the edges. I'd go back again just to try another ramen bowl with this pork topping it.\nThe rest of the toppings were pretty standard fare, and not too noteworthy otherwise (Seaweed, canned corn, bamboo strips)\nThe broth was nice and light, as I expected, and a good foil to the grease from the chicken and dumplings.\nThe noodles looked like machine made packaged noodles, but it was made to my personal preference. It was \"Soung\", a term in Cantonese I like using for the texture of noodles when they bounce back JUST enough when you bite into them. It's a sign of being al dente, according to my adoptive Italian grandma.\n\nThe sushi was pretty standard fare, honestly, and nothing to write home about. Actually, I found a fish bone in one of the rolls and prompty lost most of my enthusiasm for them.\n\nBut the ramen was all in all very good. I can't wait to try the other ramen options when I'm in the packed downtown area next.\n\nI give this place a 3.5.  Sushi was blah, but the ramen works for me.", "author": "Patrick K."}

However, I should've read all of the reviews before agreeing to go, because it was definitely not worth the 40 min wait. I have to agree with Elliot K's review ... This place is NOT sanitary!  We were seated at the sushi counter & all I can say is that I'm glad I don't eat sushi. I personally witnessed one of the sushi chefs lightly pick his nose (no, I am not exaggerating) while taking a short break from preparing the sushi. He then proceeded to rest his left hand (the one he picked his nose with) on the counter. He then proceeded to prepare more sushi without washing his hands!!! I work in a hospital so I am fastidious about washing my hands. I subsequently felt like throwing up after witnessing this horrible event. The food was also very mediocre...they do ramen better in Honolulu than here. I wouldn't recommend this place at all and would give it zero stars if I could.  All I can say is ...

The sashimi was admittedly amazing considering the location and appearance of the place, but the ramen noodle soup, which they are KNOWN for, was gross and so bad that I couldn't finish it.  I would say that it was just me, but my friend had the same experience.  The service was sub-par.  My tea was constantly empty and even after I asked for a refill, it would take way too long, even when they were not that busy.  The kicker was that the power went out not once, not twice, but THREE times during our meal that lasted less than an hour.  Nowhere else on the block had a power outage, so I am led to believe it was faulty wiring coupled with overloaded circuits.  That does not add to my comfort level for a restaurant that serves raw fish and other such things so dependent on reliable refrigeration.  Next time I'm in need of a quick, inexpensive bite to eat before the theater, I think I shall look elsewhere.", "author": "Geri-Ayn G."}

Why?  Because they use MSG in their noodles. MSG!  Um, what Chinese restaurant calls out the use of MSG so blatantly as these clowns.  Um, no one.  After listening to my friends talk up this place for weeks (people with particularly refined palates, one of whom is a CIA-trained chef) I was horrified when I opened the menu and read about their use of MSG (written in big bold letters).  Now I can be a swinging adaptable fellow when the moment calls, but MSG?  She of the palpitating heart rhythm and painful all-night headaches?  Um, no.  So instead I ordered what turned out to be a very indifferent curry dish where the best thing I can say about it is that its texture reminded me of that glue I used to eat in crafts class in elementary school.  If you like MSG this is your place. If you don't, try Volcano Curry.  Cheaper and far tastier and even better - no heart palpitating, head-splitting MSG.", "author": "Chris K."}

Anyways, I don't really get out much, what with work and such, but I do enjoy a good meal.  I am really interested in Japanese cuisine, and I love a nice heaping bowl of Ramen, so, along with that and all the rave reviews I've read on Yelp about Katana-ya, I decided to give it a try.  My boyfriend (he is a bit of a picky eater, but I know when he thinks something is good, then it is really really good) ordered rich miso ramen with pork, and I ordered the same, and a little bowl of curry and rice.  Both were incredibly delicious.  My boyfriend LOVED the ramen.  The broth was so rich and just yumtastic.  I wish I could have some right now.  And the curry was the best curry I've ever had in my life.  I docked a star becuase I ordered iced green tea and it was luke warm, but I think that is becuase they don't actually have iced green tea and she made it on the spot for me, which I appreciate, but it just wasn't as refreshing as I had hoped.

We ordered the BBQ pork ramen, spicy miso green onion ramen, and the Dynamite spicy roll (mixed fish).

The ramen noodles have a good bite and there is plenty of it.  The broth was very strong and creamy.  I like shredded pickled ginger in my ramen to balance the intense flavor so I stole it from my gf's donburi bowl and then asked for extra.  I would say this ramen tastes something like Los Angeles' Daikokuya or Orange County's Santouka Ramen.  Probably the best chicken donburi I have ever tasted... perfectly cooked chicken, egg was runny (a good thing) and the best part is that the sauce they use is not overwhelming.  Many times when you have donburi, they overuse their sauce and it gets all over the rice and it's too sweet.  Rice is like a neutralizer for me.. something to cleanse the palate for your next bite of whatever you're eating.  We had some sashimi for appetizer... hamachi and some toro... the cuts of sashimi are really thick.  My toro had a line of chewy tendon in it which I didn't like too much but for the price of less than ten bucks for two pieces, who can pass up that deal!

This ramen place definitely offer one of its own kind. The chefs are very personable and approachable. However, the young japanese waitresses there tend to be slow and chitchat a lot. sometimes, they forget about customer's order and serving customers who are waiting to get a table. It is a small but very busy restaurant. There is always a line waiting to eat there.", "author": "CC C."}

I first had ramen here about a year ago and even though I enjoyed it... I just forgot to go back.  I recently re-discovered this place and I'm addicted.  I love ramen and the prices are reasonable.  I most enjoy the shoyu based broth (heavy) and the bbq pork ramen.  I also like the miso broth.  The green onion ramen is tasty as well.  I always opt for the ramen style noodles. I have also had the sushi here which is decent but this is definitely a ramen house.  I dig the bamboo shoots they put into the mix.  I like this place a lot and I'm happy that it's around.  I'm determined to try all of the ramens in the next couple of months.", "author": "Allison M."}

This place is really, really, really bad and I'm not a food snob by any stretch of the imagination. Waited for about a half hour with high hopes. The first really big red flag was \"MSG ADDED\" at the top of the menu. All downhill from there. I ordered the butter corn ramen and swapped the pork for tofu which cost a buck. Canned corn. Really weak seaweed. Bamboo shoot was limp and dead and all alone floating in the bowl. My girlfriend ordered grilled salmon over rice and didn't touch one bite. The salmon looked and smelled like cat food. Meow? I'm not sure how they grilled a pile of ground-up salmon or how you can justify calling microwaving \"grilling\". Booty. Don't waste your time. Ten-dollar cup of soup with a long line of suckers. I imagine the high reviews are due to the fact that SF doesn't have late night choices and many who frequents this place are drunk or desperate and dizzy from the MSG. I expect Japanese food to be made with care and pride and this was not that. MSG in $10 ramen???????????????????????????????????", "author": "Matt P."}

Since then, I have been in search of re-igniting that summer love with various places serving ramen/saimin and all have failed me... at least until last week, after a friend who raved about the awesome noodles and broth at Katana-ya brought me to this little ( and I mean itty-bitty) place near Union Square. I was set up for disappointment and happily stand corrected. Although their noodles aren't exactly saimin noodles, the ramen is delicious!!! And their broth is killer! So complex and rich, it'll make you have dreams about it.  I've been craving it so badly that I'll be back tonight, less than a week since the first time. Yum!", "author": "M S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-01", "description": "As a local San Franciscan who's been to Katanaya when it first opened close to a decade ago a few blocks up on Geary and Leavenworth as a half noodle, half Henry VIII steak restaurant at what's now known as the Ambassador club, I'm nostalgic for it's old location & flavor.  My favorite ramen; Karaage ramen still exists but no longer tastes as it once did nor is it as cheap as it once was.  \nThe current place is tiny but has great FengShui as it is right smack in the middle of downtown neighboring Jack in the Box.  The waitress staff is hit or miss and like most restaurant workers appreciate good tippers and hate cheapskates and jerks that argue that they didn't order something when they in fact did.  The sushi chefs when Japanese are pros, when Chinese are sloppy and don't capture the essense nor taste of sushi.  Can you blame 'em?  I don't know why any self-respecting Japanese person would hire any non-Japanese to cut sushi.  Non-Japanese waitresses are cutting it close already.  \nShaved ice is a recent item they added to the menu which continues to be popular with the young crowd.  Some advice: don't go there if you're gonna be cheap and troublesome to the waitresses because you're too good to wait, try Jack in the Box.  If you're going with an Asian chick make sure to pick up the check, they tell me more often than not Asian chicks who go with non-asian guys end up paying.  Try to make an attempt to pretend you're paying if you're a cheap loser guy like signing the Asian girl's card or passing her some counterfeit bills so she can pay with her card and get the reward points.  Lately, there's been a lot of Asian guys taking white girls there to eat, that's a welcome sight from the usual opposite.  Lastly, be prepared to wait and go there with that attitude because Katanaya is worth it.", "author": "David K."}

This is a great little Japanese place close to Union Square.  The restaurant is tiny, seats maybe 25, but the turnover is quick.  The sushi is always the freshest and the noodles are great.

Every time we're in SF, we stop by because we know that the food is consistently good and it's very reasonable.", "author": "Nancy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-11-03", "description": "I went to try Katana Ya with my boyfriend last Friday and we ordered soft shell crab for appetizer, fried chicken ramen with miso soup and katanaya ramen with miso soup.  Because Katanaya ramen also comes with fried chicken & pot stickers, so I specifically told the waitress to put the fried chicken & pot stickers on the side.  Then, the ramen came and everything was soaked in the soup with ramen.  We told the waitress and she made a comment that the kitchen must have forgotten.  So she brought them back and about 5 mins later brought back the ramen and fried chicken & pot stickers on the side.  However, we were disappointed because the only thing they did was refrying the same pieces of chicken & pot stickers again, so they tasted soggy & greasy.  This was their fault but they were too cheap to fry new pieces of chicken & pot stickers for us, so this was our 1st time and will be our our last time there.", "author": "winnie l."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-09", "description": "We've been on a noodle mini-marathon the last few days so we decided to continue the trend with some ramen.  After a long day shopping at Union Square, we decided to revisit this place...it'd been a year or so since the last visit, which from what I remember was good but not great.  We ordered the spicy tofu ramen ($9), regular ramen ($7.50), and the small portion of curry donburi ($5.50).  The noodles were well cooked but the spicy tofu miso broth seemed a bit oily.  It also seems odd that you have to pay extra for spicy additions to the regular ramen broth.  The curry donburi was a pass -- tasted like curry you could make from the box and the accompanying salad was soggy and overly doused with creamy dressing.  Overall, not a bad option to have while in the Union Square area though it seems pricey for what you get.  Also make sure you check your bill carefully... we were charged incorrectly twice and the bill came up $10 more than it should have been.  However, the staff was very friendly and willing to correct their errors.  Visit #2 to this place was good but not great.", "author": "joyce h."}

I came during an off-peak time and it was still pretty busy - no complaints for a place open til 2am. I'm sure on a cold Saturday night, this place might be packed, so plan accordingly. I didnt' have as many problems as others complained about bad service, luckily! Ordered the spicy tofu ramen in miso broth (be warned, no meat in this sucker) and the husband ordered the kimchee ramen in shoyu broth. Personally I liked the miso broth better, as it had a better kick than the shoyu broth. Ordered the shaved ice, slightly disappointed with this 1) they ran out of the green tea ice cream that I wanted to have on top of my shaved ice, 2) didnt' give me enough condensed milk, 3) the ice was a bit more chunky and less shaven than I'd like. Overall, a good experience - I'll be back during those late night hours when I'm craving some hot soup & noodles!", "author": "Jeannette L."}
