While it does have some good options like the fresh chips, guacamole and some well cooked deep fried fish tacos and burritos, you would can find exponentially better Mexican cuisine south of Market. \n\nThe Baja Pescado burrito and tacos are my go to things to have here, and quite possibly the only thing worth getting here. I think the other tacos on the menu are pretty mediocre. The burrito bowl is awful as well, and I would rather go to Chipotle for one. I do also like the chips, salsa and guac combo here. Their corn on the cob is also decent, except for the fact that it's boiled rather than roasted. The agua fresca here is pretty hit or miss, and I've had times where it was delicious and other times where it tasted quite foul.\n\nAll in all, I would only go to Tacobar if I was really craving a burrito while I was in the area, because if you want a good fish taco, you should just go to Woodhouse Fish Co. down the street.", "author": "Neivin M."}

Shockingly, a lot of places are closed on Sundays and Tacobar is right around the corner so decided to check it out! They have a couple bfast burrito options, but I went with the classic eggs, mexican rice, pinto beans and added potatoes. All bfast burritos come with cheese, gauc and sour cream, but I nixed the sour cream (too much of one texture for me). \n\nI was actually really pleased with the burrito, really good flavor, constructed well (no extra liquid dripping everywhere) and plenty size to save half for lunch later. I was skeptical of the rice + potatoes but it worked well. Potatoes could have been crispier but not a huge deal and I'm still searching for a burrito with a nice charred tortilla. What I really missed was bacon! They have a chorizo option but I just wasn't fealing it. Also, even without a meat, my burrito still came to $12.00 which I thought was kinda of steep. All in all, I'll be back to mix up some of their bfast burrito options but I recommend stopping by here if in the neighborhood!", "author": "Aryn C."}

Had our food served AFTER another group of ladies ordered their food who were standing behind 2 other people behind us. I felt Unwelcome in this establishment since our order was pretty simple: 2 tacos, chips and salsa, one drink and a churro compared to the others who ordered taco bowl salads and a few tacos on the side with drinks in glasses and served before us. To top it off, it look like the owner who served them and checked in on them but said nothing else to the rest of the patrons. Oh we sat next to these ladies as well.

One thing that I loved was that they had two different corn appetizers: elote and esquite! I tried the esquite which is corn in a bowl with cream and cheese. It was a little watery, but overall, very yummy! I also tried the veggie tacos and a veggie burrito. The outer cheese shell that comes with the veggie tacos was interesting but not really my cup of tea. The veggies in the tacos were mainly just carrots and they didn't have a lot of flavor in my opinion. I loved the guac that it came with and they don't skimp on how much guac they give you (ahem chipotle).

Try their breakfast burrito with carne asada, cheese, and guacamole for a delicious morning treat!\n\n I'm a serious burrito snob. Everything gets compared to what I grew up with in San Diego, Rosarito, and Ensenada, and in San Francisco, very few places have been good enough.\n\nEnter Tacobar; it's become my go-to for burritos any day of the week! The carne asada is melt-in-your-mouth tender, the guacamole is on point and not too onion-y, their haba\u00f1ero salsa has great flavor, and the horchata is rich with flavors of rice and cinnamon. Even their Baja-style fish tacos and burritos have an authentic Tijuana flair! \n\nBut the crown jewel of their menu isn't any particular burrito, but simply the tortilla they wrap them in. It's soft, flavorful, and doesn't crack and break when you pick up the burritos. It's even got that stick-to-your-teeth consistency that makes it even more delicious!\n\nThe decor is reminiscent of small Baja California taco shops, brightly colored but simple, and while outdoor seating is limited, it's nice to snag a spot and people watch as you devour whatever deliciousness you ordered. Their order cards are Spanish vocabulary words, and there's a box of cards floating around the restaurant occasionally which turns waiting for your food into a fun game, trying to guess what a \"sacapuntas\" is.\n\nAll said, this place is worth every penny. Maybe one day I'll find a place in SF I like better, but until then, Tacobar is my burrito joint of choice! \n\n\u00a1Bien hecho, muchachos!", "author": "Dylan H."}

So was their fish taco. It was not crispy at all.\n\nIn summary, TacoBar didn't meet my expectations. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the overflow from the ramen fest so I will give them another chance.", "author": "Albert L."}

Food was made very quick. Burrito was wrapped nice and tight didn't fall apart at all.  \n\nCons: Menu on walls have no prices, felt like this was a trick to get people in. To add guac only in my burrito was $1.50!! Absurd. Total cost was almost $12 with no chips no drink. They offered chips and when I asked if there was an additional charge they said yes. Majority of taquerias in SF give you chips and salsa free. \n\nOverall I found the place unnecessarily overpriced.

Don't think it's not authentic, because it is and the flavors are well-balanced.\n\nI've been here couple of times and normally get the baja pescado tacos. Beer battered Mahi Mahi with cabbage slaw, roasted Ancho chile salsa and lime sauce. The fish is always fresh and served piping hot. I don't even need additional green salsa from the squirt bottle because this is just perfect on its own. Their thick chips just have the right amount of salt and I always ask them not to put cheese because I pair mine with their creamy guac. Their carne asada burrito is a good choice as well, with more meat than rice ratio. Just be prepared to spend $$ because of the location.\n\nThe line moves quickly and service is decent.

There's nothing fancy about this Pac Heights taco stand. They do basic tacos (carne asadas, carnitas, chicken, fish, etc.). They all come served on a soft tortilla with your standard pinto beans, onions, and salsa. If you're looking for heartier fare, they also offer burritos, quesadillas, and tortas. I've tried their Tortilla soup and their Avocado Ensalada Caesar, and both were quite tasty and filling. But mostly, I just stick with the tacos - especially the Baja Pescado tacos (Tempura beer battered mahi mahi, with cabbage slaw, roasted Ancho salsa and lime sauce). They usually come out in under five minutes in a plastic basket paired with two ketchup dispensers full of green and red salsa. I usually wolf my meal down in 5 minutes and then I'm out the door to embark on my next adventure.\n\nTacoBar's service is always quick and friendly. My only complaint about the place is that they list the menu items on the wall without their prices. Not sure I understand the strategy behind this tactic. Why are you trying to keep your prices secret from the customers? Also, it's unclear to me whether I'm supposed to bus my own table when I'm done. Last time I was there, I handed my dirty plate to the taco technician and he gave me a  \"Dude, why are you giving me your dirty plate? Can't you see I'm busy?\" kind of look. Oh well, these are minor complaints. I'm going to keep coming back here when I need my quick taco fix.\n\nBTW, if you're worried about parking, they have a lot on California St. @ Fillmore (adjacent to Pizzeria Delfina), or you can always park illegally at Mollie Stone's.

Another problem I have is that the amount of guacamole that they give is really inconsistent-- the first time I received a generous spread of guac and the second time I could hardly taste it. I think they skimped on the beef the second time too :(.

They have a good Jarritos selection and alright margaritas. The taco salad isn't great. Really, the take-away here is to stick with a burrito. \n\nNot a destination taqueria, but a great local place. The best feature is that the chips and salsa come with pico de gallo style salsa, plus 2 hot sauces (green/tomatillo and a smoky red), AND crumbled cojita cheese. It's a big step up from the standard chips and salsa at most places, where the quality of the chips is an afterthought.", "author": "Laura J."}

And it's always delicious.\n\nThis is a pretty small space on the corner, and even though I've only gone on weeknights it tends to be fairly full with diners so you  may have more luck opting for takeout.  The menu seems to offer your standard range of tacos, dillas, burritos, and sides/others.  I should someday try the tacos since they are the namesake item, but I'm a fan of tostadas so it may be hard for me to make the switch.  \n\nFirst of all the taco salad is quite hefty, so that's a plus.  The dressing they use is really good and they evenly coat all the lettuce with it before adding the toppings.  Beans, pico, meat, and guac, heartily cover the entire top portion so they aren't skimping.  The carnitas isn't too fatty or tough, so that's always great.  The guac tastes homemade and not like something out of a bargain store's refrigerated section so that's also great.  \n\nService is pretty fast.  The woman taking my order is always friendly.  And the workspace seems pretty clean.  \n\nIn all, I'd be willing to branch out and try other options, but if you're a fan of a good tostada/taco salad, you'll probably be happy with TacoBar's offering.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

I had two of the pulled pork tacos, which were a special the day I was there. The tacos were on your standard size corn tortilla, like you would find in any local supermarket. Another reviewer mentioned that the tortillas were three inches, mine clearly were not. The pork, which was topped by a small amount of citrus marinated onions,  was tender, tasty, plentiful and clearly of excellent quality. It was not something that you would see in a cheaper taco and wonder what part of the pig it came from. Each taco was $3.25, and in my opinion worth it. After I was finished eating a a man that I think was the chef came to my table. He was very friendly and recommended the coconut flan. It was as good as he said it would be. It was a denser flan, not jello-like in consistency, and very good. \n\nOther reviewers mentioned the small portions that one gets at the Taco Bar. After scoping out what the other patrons were eating and seeing the size of my tacos and flan, I have to wonder again if we were eating at the same restaurant.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that this place is \"deceptive\". I didn't find it so, but if you are doubtful about this place just check out a menu and look around at what others are eating. When I was there the place was very crowded and busy, a deceptive place wouldn't have such a crowd I would think.\n\nAs for the price, I believe it was fair, given the quality of the food and the quick and friendly service. \n\nI found the food at Taco Bar food to be authentic. I come from Los Angeles and have a good idea as to what good Mexican food is thanks to my Mexican friends, colleagues and students. \n\nThis place is worth your time and cash, check it out, you won't be sorry.", "author": "Ralph I."}

This new-style interpretation that TacoBar does is pretty good.  The guac is a highlight here, even with slightly-less-than-perfect avocados.  The slaw was mostly flavorless, only providing crunch.  We opted for the shrimp taco special and the shrimp are big enough to make it hard to eat without a fork, but man, that breading is great.  The combined flavors are good and the salsas are excellent.  Overall a nice job with good prices in a neighborhood filled with high prices.\n\nShe Said:\n\nWe stopped by TacoBar as we wandered about San Francisco for the day. Our intent was to find some reasonably tasty food to get us through to dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised by what Taco Bar had to offer. I had a shrimp taco with guacamole, and the shrimp was wonderful. The breading was excellent, and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Often with fried shrimp, you can't tell the difference between the breading and the shrimp, and this was definitely not the case here. Plus, the guacamole was pretty good. I would definitely be willing to stop again under similar circumstances.\n\nShe Said's Potty Points: This is a small space, so there's only one unisex bathroom. It was very clean, but although it was later in the day, there was still a wait to use the bathroom. I can't imagine what it's like during rush times.

The food is quality and authentic to what I found in Mexico City and other parts of central Mexico. \n\nWe tried 5 tacos: the poblano and mushroom and the yucatan pork on the specials board, the grilled fish, grilled shrimp, and carnitas. All this was after some great chips (sprinkled with cotija) with three quality table salsas (red, green, and spicy charred red).\n\nMost memorable was the vegetarian taco, with its great balance of herbs, pepper, and earthy mushroom flavors, rajas-style. I don't know why more places don't do stuff like this. For $3.75, it was enough bites to be a great deal for such flavor. \n\nThe fish and yucatan pork tied for second. The fish was a decent sized piece covered in a rich tomato-y sauce, Veracruz-style, over a bed of cabbage. Crunch, sauce, silky fish, nice bites. \n\nThe carnitas was the biggest portion. I was tempted to turn it into two tacos. And for $3.75, it was basically as much food as two $2 tacos at Mission places. The shrimp on the other hand was fairly tiny, so we didn't share that. But very very tasty nonetheless.\n\nIf you want great Mission tacos, go to Taqueria Vallarta. It's a totally different deal. \n\nBut TacoBar is by far the cheapest option I've found in its natural competitive set, the pan-Mexican places like Tacolicious and Colibri.\n\n**\n\nSecond trip in a week: Tried the special baja fish, which added guac and a crispy cheese layer outside the soft tortilla. The fish was delicious, super crispy and piping hot. Overall the package was unusual, tasty, and gimmicky, the kind of thing they should market more (it's rather hidden on the menu).\n\nMore importantly, this time we found the jicama and grapefruit salad. It was delicious and a huge portion. The chili-encrusted peanuts were a great foil. We'll go back just for this.", "author": "Sam P."}

Without knowing how much the total came to, I glanced at my receipt and did a double take; did this meal really cost me $11? \"Oh well, the portions are probably large\", I thought, \"and ooh look, I'll probably be munching on those tortilla chips, too!\"\n\nWrong. \n\nThe waiter brought my food over to me, sat it down, and told me to enjoy. I wasn't expecting this kind of service but it was nice. Alas, my \"quesadilla\" had arrived. Having been to Mexico I was confused whether or not I ordered a burrito or a quesadilla as I'm pretty certain there is no distinguishing factor between the two here. My \"quesadilla\" was a burrito cut diagonally. Either way, I was hungry so I ate.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: portion size. People say the portions are too small or they're too large, well, here's the scoop: if you're looking for a mission style, filled to the brim, explosively large quesadilla/burrito thing then this is NOT your place. The portion is sized where you can finish your meal, go on a stroll for an ice cream, and be perfectly satisfied. The quesadilla thing itself was very tasty and I enjoyed it very much.   \n\nWhy I'm knocking off two stars? \n\nPrice- I know you guys comment on people's reviews saying, \"We are sorry, we provide quality food, and that, obviously adds up to the cost...\" blah blah blah, but would it kill you to provide chips and salsa with burritos, quesadillas, and tacos? Honestly, you are already making a ton of money off the food, will it really break your business to add a little something else (especially something as cheap as tortilla chips)? Why does guacamole have to cost so much and why can't that just be a part of the cost, too?\n\nTacoBar is a poor alternative to other places in San Francisco because of it's pricing and food quantity. I'd suggest checking out places in the mission if you're looking for a more authentic experience (including quality, pricing, and atmosphere). I would say TacoBar is my favorite mexican restaurant on this side of town (which really doesn't say much, to be honest) because there isn't really much competition.", "author": "Tommy C."}

As always, the down fall is the execution.\n\nDespite the black Angus beef, the carne asada burrito ($7.75) was utterly flavorless.  Not spicy, not tasty, not even that good.  To top it off, there were no options for a whole wheat tortilla, black beans, or extra spicy picante sauce were listed on the printed menu or the menu board, just a regular flour tortilla, pinto beans, and Americanized, flavorless pico de gallo.  The tacos ($3.45 for carne asada, pollo, or carnitas and $3.75 for fish) are small, small, small, and just as flavorless.  No complimentary basket of chips was offered.\n\nIn addition to the soulless entr\u00e9es, the two salsas offered were amateur, at best.  The red, chipotle-based sauce was too smoky, and the green, tomatillo-based sauce lacked fire.  There were not even any branded sauces (Tapatio, Cholula, or even the old standby Tabasco) available to make up for the poor quality housemade sauces and increase the heat.\n\nService was friendly and the cashier moved people through the line quickly.  The line cooks were quick, and food was delivered promptly.\n\nIn this city full of excellent Mexican establishment, one could (and should) expect more.  With its high prices and top-notch ingredients, Tacobar just doesn't deliver.", "author": "CJ G."}

One of the best parts is that this place hasn't yet been discovered by the masses, so food can be obtained without horrendous lines and inexorable waiting times like so many other SF spots.  You may have to wait for an outside table on a sunny day, however.\n\nWe recommend the camaron taco, the carne asada burrito (I swear this baby weighs about 2 lbs!), and the chips, salsa, and guacamole.  Keep your eye on the daily specials, however, as those can be equally delicious (cow tongue anyone?).  Two tacos with some shared chips is plenty of food for one person.  The camaron taco is served with cabbage instead of beans (the cabbage isn't smothered in mayo, thankfully), so it is a nice healthy alternative.  \n\nIngredients claim to be local/free-range/organic and all that great stuff.  You will not be disappointed eating here, whether dining in the restaurant or (better yet if you live nearby) getting take out.  \n\nIn response to the posters who complain that the chips and salsa are not free, we have found that many \"authentic\" taquerias in the Mission also charge for chips and salsa.  TacoBar's chips are especially delicious and worth the few extra bucks, plus paying extra seems pretty standard for SF (ever notice how Thai/Burmese places in the City charge you for rice?).\n\nWe eat here about once per week because it never disappoints and prices are extremely reasonable for Pacific Heights and not unreasonable for any part of the City.", "author": "Wolfgang C."}

But our total came to almost $30 for two tacos, two kids burritos, and chips and salsa (I didn't get guacamole or drinks to save money).  Aren't chips and salsa complimentary?  We did get 3 tap waters, so maybe we were charged for them?  I had was holding $20 in my hand and expected to get some change!

They were extremely friendly as I blundered my way through the order (ordering  dinner when your head is full of cold medicine is not always the most coherent thing to do), and to top it all off, they insisted on making me a new burrito when I realized too late that I had forgotten to ask them to make mine without rice.

We had planned to eat inside but after circling around for 15 minutes looking for a parking spot with no luck, we parked in a yellow zone and my wife waited in the car (while I went inside) in case the dreaded meter maid decided to rear her ugly head.\n\nImmediately after walking through the doors a friendly gentleman greeted me at the door and handed me a menu.  Based on his smile and his eagerness to please, I am pretty sure he is one of the owners of this joint.  There was also a menu board on the wall, but the annoying thing is that this menu didn't have any prices.  The paper menu I was handed was not designed well and was also unorganized (another annoyance). Since I am a born again vegetarian I asked the woman at the register (presumably the wife of said owner) what their vegetarian options were.  She told me about the burrito and the cheese quesadilla so I ordered both (burrito for my wife and quesadilla for me) as well as an order of guacamole, chips, apple juice, and diet coke.  I was shocked when she spit out the total of $25.50, but at that point I was starving and had little time to find anything else.\n\nAfter waiting for 10 minutes, they handed me the bag of food and I opened it up to check if everything was there.  Good thing I did because they didn't include utensils or napkins (annoying).  \n\nThe food itself was ok and after eating it my wife and I both felt a little ill.  Not food poisoning ill, but just not right ill.  The food at this place is on par with those taquerias you find on every street corner in various parts of the Mission.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-11", "description": "Ok so I love Mexican food, and I figured that this place should be in my wheel house so to speak. I had a quesadilla, a taco, and a few sangrias. First off, the sangrias. They were uniqure and genuine, with a large amount of fruit on the bottom that served as good snacking material once the drink had been consumed. But they were over $5 a piece for a lil cup! A bit pricey. Really too Pricey.\n\nNext the taco. I go the fish taco, and while it was pretty good, the biggest problem with it was again the price, while the taco was good it wasn't amazing and I have certainly had better around SF for a more reasonable price ( even Tacolicious, which is the heart of the marina, 4 tacos over better quality can be had for $12, a price that beats Taco Bar) The biggest problem with the taco was that it seemed to rely too much on the sauce. It is as if the place was afraid to lean to heavily on the fish and the batter for the flavor and instead decided to let the sauce dictate the flavor. The photo I uploaded demonstrates this. Sauces should be like back up singers, they are important and can really bring a song to life, but you don't go to a concert to listen to Kate Perry's back up singers. You want the main event! And the amount of sauce on the taco interferes with letting the flavor of the fish take center stage.\n \nThe quesadilla was my favorite. Pretty well sized and made, it was a wonderful combination of flavors where, in contrast to the taco, all the flavors could be tasted and each contributed to a delightful flavor. However, it's a quesadilla. It should be the easiest Mexican food to make and should be good and would take a lot to really blow me away. (It has happened tho)\n \nOverall, 3 stars. Very solid place, but I haven't had anything yet that would really push me to giving it 4. If I go back I will try something else and update. Hopefully we will be able to bump this up a bit.", "author": "Tom O."}

I asked the lady on the counter when it came if it was really iced tea and she was quite emphatic that it was. \n\nOverall I got the idea that they are trying to fancy it up to charge more but with gimmicks rather than flavors.

This place is what happens when you take cheap street food and try to convince highfalutin upper crusts that it is more valuable then it is.  I will include a picture below of the taco I got for 4 dollars.  I am pretty sure it was served on a 3 inch corn tortilla.  They had wrapped the cord tortilla with \"cheese crisp\".  Nice touch, but street food is great because of the flavor not the expense of the ingredients.  If you are going to try and elevate poor peoples food you better be damn good.

I am always looking for the best burrito I can get with reasonable parking, a shop that is easy to get in and out of and that is close to my house.  I eat burritos almost every night.....these things are critical. \n\nTacoBar spikes really highly on the old in and out, they handle phone orders super well and you can park in Mollies parking, no worries.  Wait, I can park in Mollies no worries.  You shouldn't.  It's unethical.  And Bob, Mollies resident panhandler, might tell on you....\n\nSo, TacoBar spikes super high on the ease of use side, how about the burrito?  It's good.  I wasn't sold my first time in, it has an unusual kinda salty flavor that I wasn't sure I loved.  But strangely, a day went by, then another day and I found myself craving said strange salty flavor.  They got me with the cheese.  So I started going back fairly regularly.  The people are friendly, the chips are good.  All good stuff.\n\nWhich in sum equates to about 3 stars......maybe 4, but TacoBar did something last night that went above and beyond.  \n\nOne more aside:  I absolutely hate Sour Cream.  Like despise Sour Cream.  The only thing in the world I hate more is Mayonnaise (and the Dodgers I guess but that's unrelated).\n\nOk, onward.  My wife stopped to pick up burritos for us last night.  My super no sour cream and her veggie thing.  When she gets home I take a bite and worst possible scenario, tons of sour cream up in my burrito.  Ahhh, sour cream. I'm bitter but reasonable. I eat a lot of burritos, these things happen.  They don't happen to me cause I hover over the counter and monitor the burrito making process, but they do happen.\n\nWe call and tell them what happened expecting to have to go pick up a new burrito and what do they do?  Deliver a brand spanking new, sour cream free burrito to my apartment in like 10 minutes (literally) with a free dessert.  You know this is a burrito shop, not a pizza delivery place, right.  Just checking.  \n\nI was blown away and will be a customer for life, or until Mollies starts cracking down on the use of their parking lot.......", "author": "Eamonn T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-04-24", "description": "I really wanted to be a fan of this place - when I saw it being built, I was ecstatic. This morning, when I checked the reviews, I chalked the low ratings up to \"lower pac height snobs\" who were expecting too much out of a taco place. Unfortunately, I have either become one of those folks, or, as I suspect, this place isn't marketing itself well.\n\nTacoBar makes you think it will be a down-to-earth taco place, however, it's actually a pseudo-gourmet take on Mexican food. That alone doesn't give it the low rating, though - it's the price mixed with the attitudes mixed with the poor explanations of what you are getting.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I ordered, we got 2 carnitas tacos, a carne asada quesadilla with the extra crema fresca and guacamole, and chips and salsa. A lot of people on here complained about the price of chips, but for the quality of chip and salsa, they were amazing. However, the guy in front of me got his salsa and some cheese heaped on the chips, and I got a relatively small pot of salsa. I had to ask why mine were different than his, and they said \"oh you have to ask for that\" which I didn't understand (how would I know that?) and then I had to ask for the cheese. I thought the guac came with the chips, but that was my mistake, and I was fine with that.\n\nWe sat outside (not a ton of seating, but it's a nice place inside) and besides the really annoying guy's barking dog (people, don't go to a restaurant and tie your dog up. You are a jerk when you do this) it was really nice. I was annoyed that when I tried to use a squeeze bottle for the salsa, the top wasn't screwed on and it all poured out everywhere, but again, small thing. \n\nMy biggest disappointment was the main course. My boyfriend had tacos, which he said were fine - the pork was a little bland and a little dry. However, my \"quesadilla\" was not a quesadilla. At first we thought I got a burrito in some flakey kind of flatbread. I inquired as to where my sour cream and guac were (every quesadilla I've ever gotten has the pico de gallo, sour cream, and guac on the side and that's why I love them) and the woman went back in to get them. She didn't return - instead a guy who I believe was the owner came. He showed me my receipt and told me I never ordered guacamole, and I said \"I got this with the special extra\" and he said \"that's not the same as guacamole. You have to pay a lot of money for that.\" \n\nI thought that was a really weird and rude thing to say, so I told him he should explain his menu better and he pointed at my food and said \"I can see guacamole in there.\" Then he left.\n\nThere was, indeed, something resembling a little guacamole inside my not-quesadilla, but it was such a pathetic amount that I will say that no one should get the extra - for two bucks a glop of sour cream and a tiny green coloring of guacamole isn't worth it. Avocado isn't gold, people. \n\nOverall, however, I didn't like the quesadilla. The tortilla wasn't a tortilla, it was shaped like a burrito and difficult to eat, and overall this take on fusion wasn't what I was expecting nor what I would have ordered had I know. Couple that with the rude owner and the lack of explanations, I'm never going back to this place. \n\nIf you guys can get your attitudes in order and figure out a good system for selling things that doesn't leave people confused and feeling ripped off, I'll come back. I have no qualms paying $25 like I did today for the meal I had - I just don't want to feel verbally assaulted by the owner because I asked where my sides were. Food isn't a fine art.

After braving the grub-tastic, hipsterrific taquerias in the Mission, being served Mexican food by a Caucasian on Fillmore St. (for $4 a taco no less) didn't seem like one of the best decisions ever. But, the hubby wanted Mexican and didn't want to drive to the Mission, so here we were. \n\nI actually lucked out and ordered what had to be the best taco on the menu - a special of braised beef marinated in ancho chilli and served up with a creamy sauce and chopped cabbage. I also had a pretty delicious Veracruz fish taco - spicy grilled as opposed to breaded Baja style. Delish and just the right amount to get me to that happy place.\n\nNot so lucky was dear hubby, who in his hunger opted for a carnitas \"burro\" (slightly smaller size burrito) that was  sorely lacking in meat. We sliced into it and came up with nada by way of protein, just a squishy mess of rice, beans and guac. There must have been all of 3 carnitas cubes in there, which considering the $6 price tag was no bueno. I asked him how it tasted and after a pause, he just said, \"It tastes... white.\" Nuff said.\n\nAnd, we had to pay separately for chips AND salsa, which weren't half as good as the free stuff you get in the Mission (or Papalote for that matter).

Try Tacobar.\n\nI decided to go with the Tortilla Soup, for a sky-rocketed $7.95.  This is not a restaurant, nor is the atmosphere restaurant-like.  It's supposed to be a high-end Mexican cantina.  Well, at modest Mexican cantinas I get chips & salsa, and when I ask for water I'm given a real glass of water -- Tacobar insists you buy bottled water, or you can self-serve yourself with a freakin' DIXIE CUP OF WATER!  I'm not rinsing and spitting for my dentist, yo!  I'm paying $9 bucks for bland and too salty soup without chips and salsa while sitting in a corner with my knees hitting the wall!  You think that shopping and driving in Mexico are an altered state of reality?  Try Tacobar.\n\nI suspected I was expecting too much my first visit, so I gave Tacobar another try yesterday.  I got a Carne Asada Taco to go.  I was given a little attitude on ordering just one taco - but that's all I wanted this time.  I asked about chips and salsa, as I didn't get them the first time I was there as anyone would expect from Mexican cuisine, but I was told that's separate.  Well, my one taco was more than $5 bucks so chips and salsa really should've been included.  I didn't get them.\n\nI got my Steak Taco to go and got to eating it within a few minutes -- it wasn't really warm, the pinto beans (loose, not mashed or refried for ease of eating) were falling from every direction and the carne asada and pico de gallo were barely visible - NO NAPKINS INCLUDED!  My friend I was sitting near wondered when I'd become a vegetarian and why I was eating a runny, bean taco!

Sure beats gnawing your arm off!\n\nI anticipated giving this place 1 star, as I was warned that it was craptastic/bland-tastic.  The taco was decent sized, seemed to weigh a lot.  I like to drench my tacos w/tons of salsa, so the taco actually had flavor to me. \"Green salsa flavor\", that is.  At the end, I decided to try a piece of the chicken on its own, without swimming in the green salsa.  And...it was indeed bland.  Even the pico de gallo included in the taco was bland--needs more cilantro, spices, onions, fire, FLAVOR! Funny how starving all day and dumping on verde salsa can cloud judgement and magically add a star to yelp review!\n\nI was surprised there were actually a fair number of people eating here. But, they all looked tired, like they'd been shopping and starving all day, eating at an odd hour...\n\nI have no desire to return (unless I happen to find myself on Fillmore & Cal, about to gnaw my arm off once again).", "author": "Caroline I."}

Also, no free chips - paid $2.95 for a small bowl of chips and tasteless pico de gallo. In all, paid $22 for a tiny lunch for two people that I would have paid probably less than $10 for at Pancho Villa in the Mission and it would have tasted way better. \n\nOn top of that, when we finally snagged a table outside, it was filled with someone else's dirty dishes with no bussing service in sight. I ended up bussing the table myself to someone inside - two trips - but at least the hostess/waitress thanked me cheerfully both times. \n\nBottom line: at $5 for a bland taco, save your money and pray for the return of La Salsa.", "author": "G O."}

Yes, it could be spicier but I'll take fresh, organic (or so I'm told), delicious salsa anyday over three day old pink, chewy tomato salsa.  The quesadilla was fantastic with a crispy, toasted flour tortilla.  I don't usually order carne asada but I chanced it this time.  The flavor was great and it wasn't gristly.  Sure, it's \"funny shaped\"  to what most people are used to but it's still a damn 'dilla.  Meat, cheese, guac and sour cream.  It's filling, but not in that nasty, greasy, cheese oil down my face kind of way.  In fact, I ate 7 hours ago and I'm just starting to get hungry again.\n\nMinus one star for being SUPER expensive.

You could cut it in half and use it for two meals if you wanted to.  Ideally, I'd share a veggie burrito with a friend and maybe have a taco or quesadilla as well.\n\nThe salsa verde was good.

For taco places it is the Carne Asada Burrito. I bought one and was disappointed by several factors. First off the price. It was $8.50 Were this to be a super burrito that would be a good price, but it wasn't. Second of all the size. It was very understuffed, which resulted in a big wedge of tortilla tucked on the side. As far as the composition of the burrito. It was alright, simple but it was well crafted.\n\nOther then the mediocre burrito, another that bothered me was the lack of complimentary tortilla chips. This was the first taco place i have ever been to to not give tortilla chips with the meal. The salsa was there but there were no chips.\n\nNot to be completely negative, The interior of the restaurant was nice.

Great flavor and spice, plus I love the sauce they bring to your table so you can use as much as you want(my fav is the green one!) Not to mention they have the best Aqua Fresca!! I have tried the watermelon and the pinnapple- to die for!

But the large scoop of beans and bland meat that make up the bulk of the taco are not very pallitable, the lackluster salsas do little to help the situation.\n\n2) The prices, way too high.\n\nA taco for $7, $8 for a fish taco, is insane. Granted this includes the additional price incurred ($1.95) to make our taco \"especial\". Especial at TacoBar means your taco comes with Guacamole and Chorizo Cheese. Sounds good, how could chorizo cheese be bad? Well it is, the guacamole is all right , but the cheese is almost as disappointing as the meal as a whole. Its basically like a Parmesan crisp, cheese fried with a little chorizo into a flattened disc. A great garnish idea,but not something you want to eat a bunch of. They make it into a disc the size of a tortilla and than sandwich it between your two tortillas. The idea i guess is it would add a crunchy texture and some cheesy flavor, but when you fry cheese and flatten it down all the flavor leaks out and your left with a tasteless disc of cheese with a texture similar to soft plastic. A scoop of guacamole and plastic cheese for $1.95, no thanks. Not that eliminating it will help your bottom line, the tacos by themselves are all around $5.\n\n3) the place and the food is cumbersome and awkward. \n\nThe tacos are almost too big too handle or bite, and too awkwardly constructed to lie flat and go at with a fork and knife. The jicama salad is made up of thick coins of jicama and accompanied by smashed grapefruit, barely reconizeable as the pretty fruit that it is. Than there is the space, small and cramped the space is made smaller by the fact that the owner/manager has made one of  the few stools his office.

This means the texture is basically mush and I really don't know why I'd blow so many calories on something so mediocre.

I don't think I've ever tasted a more delicious taco than the two I ordered, one was a \"Veracruz Pescado\" with grilled Mahi-Mahi, and the other was \"Baja Pescado\" with Tempura beer battered Mahi-Mahi. Both were awesome, but I must say the \"Baja\" was OUTSTANDING!!!!!! My friend ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla, and was very pleased. I couldn't believe how much beef was in it, and it was delicious. The Mexican Rice Pudding was also very tasty, with chopped Mango on top. This was my second time eating the food from TacoBar. Again, I highly reccommend this place for authentic Mexican cuisine, you will not regret it. Also, the service was outstanding, the girl that took the order on the phone, and the waiter who helped bag it, just overall ***** (five stars)!!!!!", "author": "Vince F."}

Instead, I shrugged and said, \"this cheese, its a bit...rubbery.\" To which she replied it was meant to be a cheese crisp. This is the cheese crisp I had paid $1.95 to have added to my fish taco that they had sandwiched between my two tortillas. Well, someone ought to educate the owner on what happens when you fry cheese. The oil comes out, the flavor leaves with it, and you are left with rubbery cheese that is neither palatable nor very digestible. A good garnish, yes, but give me some cotija, not this crappy cheese disc thing. The part that gets me the the most, though, is that if you are going to walk around asking your (clearly disappointed) patrons how their (clearly bland) meal is, then listen to them!! Don't you realize you are in the first few months of being open and that your diners may have some real feedback to help you improve and make me actually want to come back?! Listen to your paying customers, your neighbors, and your potential future return patrons.\n\nAlex D. had the carnitas taco. He left at least 2/3 of it behind. His poor little tasteless, all-filler-no-killer, bland bean and tasteless salsa mess, was so bad he didn't want to waste precious tummy space on it.\n\nMy fish taco which I made Especial (read: NOT Especial at all) was a hot mess of bland, not crispy or fresh tasting fish, topped off with some more bland guacamole and crema. It was not easy to eat, nor good to eat. YUCK. And PLEASE tell me how you can possibly justify charging $1.95 to add a teaspoon of guac, a teaspoon of crema, and crap plastic cheese to my already overpriced taco?! I'm not a cheap person, and I'll be the first to pay for quality, but this my friends was not quality at all.\n\nThe Jicama salad was a poor excuse for a salad. It was literally huge discs of jicama, combined with unrecognizable mashed tasteless grapefruit, cilantro, and peanuts - it was impossible to eat. At least julienne cut the freakin' jicama so your diner can eat your bad tasteless salad!\n\nI just returned from Puerto Vallarta where I had amazing food, with tons of flavor. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled, but I think even someone who dines at Denny's would think TacoBar has forgotten their flavor in their food.\n\nI've read that the owner here used to work with the guys from Nick's Crispy tacos. Save yourself from this mess of a taco shop and go to Nick's. I don't love that place either, but at least your won't feel ripped off by some bitchy owner at this new Pac Heights establishment and you can use your leftover cash to catch a cab to the Mission for some real flavor.\n\nNever again.", "author": "Abby Z."}

Besides filling a sorely needed casual dinner/taco shop on Fillmore, the food here is pretty great. It's fresh and tasty and service has always been friendly. I typically order the fish tacos and nachos with carne asada. I think the nachos can be a bigger portion size, but it's sooooo good maybe I'm just greedy. The food is probably a bit more expensive than the stuff you get elsewhere, but it's in Pac Heights and I think the food is better than most places in the Mission (where some of the food can be a bit geasy). This is a good neighborhood spot, if you're in the area.  I'd like to deduct a half star to make this a 3.5 star review because of ONE THING: What's up with not listing the prices? I know maybe prices can change daily, but that really irks me. Consumers have the right to know what they're paying for and its embarrassing to ask the cashier how much each of your items cost.  Anyway, bf and I typically order two fish tacos, one meat taco, one order of nachos, and a hotchata for $26 for those of you who are wondering what a meal for two would cost.", "author": "Trinh N."}

I really enjoy the salad, which has a generous amount of well-seasoned chicken, crispy lettuce and ripe avocado.  It's really good with a couple of generous splashes of the salsa verde.  The burro camarones, while it was yummy, had a lot of liquid in it and therefore it wasn't really possible to eat the last 1/5 or so of the burro because it simply falls apart into a heap of shredded cabbage and watery juice.  They should think about having rice instead of slaw and just dressing it with a nice mango salsa.  It would hold up better.

It's above the quality of La Tortilla or whatever it was before.  \n\nBUT Tacobar....THIS place is incredibly overpriced, the service is poor...slow and not friendly...did I mention the awful fluorescent lighting? I have ordered in twice and to-go twice.  Waited WAY too  long for both services.  Once it was busy and I waited 20 mins for -to-go (they hadn't been open for long so I was patient).   The manager so nicely gave me some chips because he realized I had been there forever and got skipped in the line somehow.\n\nSo tonight, hopeful.... I go in and order a baja pescado burrito on the menu for $8.5. I add guacamole which I know is extra and ask to replace the cabbage with a small portion of rice/beans.....and she tells me the total is $14.  How do you go from $8.5 to $14 by swapping out a few mexican ingredients!   I hadn't ordered anything else! Mind you this includes ZERO CHIPS.  Not even a handful on top of the bag. ZERO.  And you get 2 tablespoons of red and green salsa.   SERIOUSLY?!  The food is decent but it's nothing to brag to your friends about.  Besides, the pricing and service bring the quality of the food down.  It just does. \n\nWe all know there is better Mexican in the mission and then there is the AMAZING Little Chihuahua...which is a similar concept of using local organic ingredients and natural meat.  At Little Chihuahua you get all the chips you want and there is self service to about half a dozen salsas that are delicious.  And Little Chihuahua is on there second store and they are reasonably priced.  SO TACOBAR....rethink your business model, your customer service, your prices and try again.

The staff was nice and the atmosphere was cute.  That's pretty much all this place has going for them though.  I ordered the chicken burrito and my boyfriend ordered a fish taco.  The chicken burrito tasted okay, but nothing out of the ordinary.  My poor boyfriend suffered from starvation, as his taco had a tiny piece of fish and was mostly filled with cabbage.  For the price, the taco was a total rip-off!  He was pretty disgusted and I was disappointed.

I guess when you have a place as well designed and trendy looking, it kind of raises your expectations. So with that in mind we were mostly disappointed in our food.\nWe ordered 4 facos; baja fish, fish varacruz, carne asada and carnitas. The tacos look really impressive. They are mini cornucopias of lettuce and filling. The baja fish taco was by far the best with a tangy dressing  and fried fish. It's a no-brainer. The veracruz was a little anemic on the fish and the veracruz sauce tasted like canned tomatoes. The carne asada was tender but had no real flavor. Carnitas tasted boiled and bland. The pinto beans in the meat tacos had no flavor and the meat tacos were topped with plain chopped tomatoes. Not even pico de gallo. I understand that Mexican food doesn't have to be super spicy to be good, but a little cilantro, onion, herbs, anything. \nThe only salsas are two squirt bottles on each table. The red salsa has a smoky, roasted flavor. The green one tastes like cactus/nopales. Pretty good, but if you want spice neither of those will satisfy you.\nNo complimentary chips. It is expensive.\nIce cream flavors look intriguing. \nStill left yearning for a solid Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. \nI don't think I will go back. Though I am curious to try their burrito. They looked really sad and I am wondering if they could be as bad as they look. I guess it's a lose/lose bet with myself.", "author": "Camila F."}

Today I got a chicken burrito \"especial\". It was $10.53 including tax and was thoroughly underwhelming for the amount of money I spent. The chicken in it was really good, but so good in a way that it made me realize how everything else in the burrito was just average. The tortilla had little flavori, rice was kind of overcooked, beans were beans and probably from a can and not homemade, pico was made with somewhat questionable tomatoes, sour cream was abundant in a way that was kind of gross, cheese was definitely not melted as described on the menu and the guacamole was pretty good. It came with a smokey red salsa and a salsa verde in tiny cups, but I'm not really into smokey/chipotle flavors or tomatillos so I passed. My biggest problem was that the burrito cost me nearly $11 and wasn't served with chips. WTF. 7 or 8 chips would have made everything a bit better and they for sure would not be getting a 2-star review. \n\nThis place for sure caters to the yuppy Fillmore crowd and has a monopoly on Mexican food on the street. It's great that they use quality meats/fish but it was quite clear that the tomatoes used in the pico were pumped full of god knows what chemicals.
