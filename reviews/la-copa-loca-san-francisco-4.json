Small as it may be, the little store more than makes up with excellent service, love, and of course, the icy treats.  The neighborhood gelateria is home to some of the most mesmerizing gelatos around.  One such example is the flamboyant  dragonfruit.  \n\nThe problem?  Too many flavors to choose from!  Sampling alone took a little while, not to mention picking out a flavor or two from the mix.  Ended up going with quanabana and pistachio.  Both were creamy, smooth, distinct, and left us desiring for more.  \n\nThe spot to go for that perfect ending to the evening (or just about any time).", "author": "Ken L."}

What I find unique about this place is that they carry tropical flavors such as coconut, tamarind, and soursop, and overall, they do a great job in terms of texture and flavor. \n\nI tend to like tart flavors, so I was pleased that their tamarind sorbet was sour but with enough sweetness to make its tartness not be overpowering. I also like their pineapple sorbet, and you can sample several flavors if you need help making a choice. I tried their Pi\u00f1a Colada shake (which combines pineapple sorbet and coconut sherbet) during my most recent visit, and while I liked the combined flavors of the shake, the whipped cream that I added did not taste sweet to me. I'm not sure if the sweetness of the shake overpowered the whipped cream, but the whipped cream just seemed bland. \n\nDuring the late afternoon, this place seems to be a popular spot for children/teens, but I find that the line moves relatively quickly.", "author": "Keith H."}

This guy lives and breathes Gelato now and takes it very seriously. I first found out about La Copa Loca from a billionaire in Los Angeles who vacations yearly in Italy. He noted La Copa Loca was run by a talented Gelato maker from Italy-- we both agreed the name was odd but... I can say as a fellow Italian that this place rivals anything I have had in Rome, Milan, Naples, or Florence. \n\nI've been coming here since it opened. I've also been all over Italy stopping in every Gelato place I walked by. This place is the real deal people even though it is marketed towards the local Mexican people, it is pure breed Italian.

Go get some ice cream. \n\nWhile some of the flavors and concoctions may not be up to American standards in sweetness, if you stick to the originals you will not be disappointed as long as you know what Gelato is.

My favorites to date have been pistachio (always a favorite of mine) and the caf\u00e9/coffee flavors.  \n\nMy husband and I are huge gelato fans; we even took a gelato making class in NYC for fun.  We had learned that if you truly want to know whether a place makes good, authentic gelato, you should request to taste their pistachio flavor.  Because it's one of the more expensive flavors to make (due to the high price of the pistachios), many places don't use the actual nuts, but instead use artificial ingredients to \"mock\" the taste.  This place's gelato was creamy, delicious, had a great flavor, and yes - you called it - tasted just like you popped one of those delicious little green nuts in your mouth. \n\nHighly recommend.  Just a note - we've found the gelato doesn't do so great if you freeze it at home; we've gotten the larger \"to-go\" containers for nights we've had people over to serve alongside cake/desserts.

As I walked by the store I was surprised at my own quick reflex of glancing back at a very attractive woman walking out. Well, it wasn't about her and her yoga pants because I just lost the opportunity to treat, but it was more about the colorful accessory she was carrying; a tall pink double scoops on an attractive waffle cone. All of the sudden, I found her equally quick reflex towards the waffle cone as she took the biggest bite I have ever seen of anyone. Wow, it was love at first bite--the waffle cone I mean. \n\nSo I had to walk in opposite of the woman into the store to check out these gelati. The store was tiny with an overhead sign to encompass a menu of gelati, crepes, among other sweets and treats. There were a few chairs and tables available outside with a big sign that features their corn flavored gelato among other flavors. After some unenthused sample of their mango and mint chocolate gelati, I decided to go with a scoop coffee and pistachio on a waffle cone ($3.50). My first bite into the pistachio had a licorice sensation so it took me a few more bite in order to get adjusted. The coffee flavor was pretty good and the server did a nice job at packing the cone all the way to the bottom. Texture-wise, it was not as thick and air tight as some other gelato places, so it's difficult to consider this a traditional gelato experience as it tasted closer to a thick and creamy ice cream. \n\nInitially I had some thoughts about getting their crepes but a few of their crepe skins that were left on the counter looked sloppy and unappetizing. In addition, service was distanced with the server looking annoyed when I asked for the receipt. Otherwise, I did enjoy my generous sized waffle cone that came at a good price. 3.5 stars for the overall experience.

Don't stalk me, please).\n- It's pretty cheap for SF.  $3.75 gets you two large scoops and a waffle cone.  Not bad.\n- Despite its location in the Mission, it's still under the hipster radar so there's never a line. (!!!)\n- It's a local business with a heart-warming ambition.  Straight from their website: \"Our goal is simple: Provide the best gelato in San Francisco to our faithful patrons for reasonable prices in a friendly, warm environment.\"  How great is that?\n\nBut try as I might (and I did try quite a few times), I just can't fall in love with a gelato place if the gelato itself is pretty forgettable.  On one occasion I've even found chunks of ice in my gelato, which was memorable in a bad way.  I'm not even sure that what they serve here is truly considered gelato.. It leans more on the icy, sherbet-y side than the creamy and rich side, which isn't necessarily a bad thing and actually makes for a refreshing treat on a warm day in the Mission, but I just wanted to point that out in case you were expecting gelato of the denser, creamier variety.\n\nSo overall, this place is just alright.  If it weren't for all the other factors that I've listed then I would for sure spend my ice cream money elsewhere.  I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come back.\n\nFor those reviewers who commented on the \"sketchy location\" here: shaddup!

Some of them have been around a long time.  Others are techie (tacky?) and make ice cream with Frankenstein machines.  Whatever.  The point is, how does it taste?  Does it make you want to marry it? 'Cause you will want to marry the gelato here!  Mauro came straight from Italy, with honest-to-goodness Italian gelato machines, and with Italian gelato know-how.  Can't be beat!

La Copa Loca is conveniently located between Mitchell's and Bi-Rite to ensure that no hipster is ever too far from from an emergency rush of cold, creamy sweetness.  Personally, I like Naia better for its wider gamut of unusual flavors, but they have a few gems here, like the oft-cited limoncello and banana nutella (I went with the giandujia, nut-flavored chocolate.  Which begs the question: why isn't all chocolate nut-flavored?  It's only sensible).

Anyway, I'm not trying to write a book report here so suffice it to say it's basically a diary of one woman's journey to find herself; you know, like every bitch is doing now that Stella got her groove back and that other middle aged white chick got a Tuscan sunburn or something. Anyway, there's nothing terribly groundbreaking about this book (except that somebody got paid MONEY to write it??) so the only reason I bring it up is that she spends a third of the book eating a ton of gelato. Not like, visiting cultural masterpieces or boning hot Italian dudes. Just eating gelato. Anyway.\n\nYou can read the book if you really want to know why because I honestly don't have the energy to recap all the lifetime original issues that landed this chick in Rome on a soul-searching mission, but suffice it to say she's not there to bone a bunch of Italian dudes or appreciate the architecture, she is there to eat a lot of gelato. So while I feel a mild irritation at the way this book highlights every weak and undesirable aspect of the feminine condition, it makes me crave delicious gelato like nobody's business. \n\nWhich is funny, because I've never been a huge gelato person. I mean, it's sweet and delicious and I'll eat it, but I'm never like \"Let's go get some gelato! [Insert three words of Italian that make no sense because I don't know Italian here.]\" I mean, I've been to gelaterias in Italy, I've bought pints of Ciao Bella at my local fancy mart, and lord knows I've spent enough time in Belgano on 24th St. \nI've just never caught the fever, I guess.\n\nBut La Copa Loca: this is a fever I could catch. With flavors like fresh Limoncello and Banana/Nutella, I'd be happy to walk around eating gelato and overanalyzing my flaws all day. Well, that, but minus the overanalyzing of flaws, because it's a huge waste of time. \n\nAnd, La Copa Loca will bring their gelato to you, with a cheap and easy catering setup that will make your next party a hit. Plus, you'll have leftovers for days. And a scoop of Bacio sprinkled with ground coffee at about 3pm has a quite restorative effect on a person.

It is basically the junk food version of gelato. What sets gelato apart from mere mortal ice cream, at least for me, is the contradictory combination of being airy yet creamy at the same time. The gelato was smooth and not inedible but I definitely will not send any friends here when they ask for a gelato recommendation. This place reminds me of Toy Boat in the Richmond district. Both places are fine if you just want to gather with friends and have some dessert. However, if you are specifically seeking out good dessert you will be sorely disappointed. \n\nThe service knocks this place down even further. I will preface this by saying there was a misunderstanding but that really is irrelevant. Why? If you immediately launch into being a fucking asshole you are deservedly branded as fucking asshole. Misunderstanding or not. \n\nWhen I walked in I told him I'm not ordering yet since I was waiting for some friends. Apparently he thought I was just using the place to lounge around until my friends arrived. He told me to get out. Three times. After it finally sunk into his fucking thick head that I was actually going to order something later he left me alone. Plus, I ordered the profiterole dessert but wanted a different flavor than vanilla. So, he ends up giving me the profiterole dessert and a scoop of the chocolate separate. After I explained to him that he misunderstood he said no, that's what the profiterole dessert comes with. Asshole just didn't want to swallow his mistake. So I ended up getting stuck with two scoops of shitty gelato.\n\nI usually don't care that much about service if the food is good. Chinese restaurants being a stellar example of this.

As authentic as it gets outside of Italy and with some  additional varieties for local tastes--such as soy and low-sugar-- as well.  \n\nService is friendly, and multilingual. They take credit cards, too, which is a big bonus as I don't usually carry much cash. \n\nThey always have a good range of flavors, yet not too many (which would mean all the gelato sits around and gets old. Since LCL keeps their flavor variety limited, they sell fast and it doesn't get stale). \n\nI lived in several regions of Italy for four months and ate gelato at least once a day every day, often more--seriously. I got to know the best--and worst--gelaterias in my towns. La Copa Loca ranks up amongst the best I've had, even when compared to the ones back in Italy.  \n\nAnd it's definitely the *best* I've had in the SF area. Ciao Bella? Ok, but expensive. Naia (sp?)? Ditto, and not as fresh. Bi-Rite? Not gelato, and although they have some good flavors I don't care to pay  $5 for a few scoops. \n\nSpeaking of which, LCL's prices are quite reasonable--unlike Bi-Rite, where you pay more for the location and trendiness than the quality of the product itself. \n\nGiven that we in the US can't get the *exact* same fruit and milk that is used in Italy, Mauro does a great job of finding alternative, high-quality ingredients when needed. (Some of his ingredients do in fact come from Italy, but things like Italy's fresh milk, eggs and fresh, ripe, sweet fruit either can't be imported or are prohibitively expensive). \n\nHe also does some great snacks, from sandwiches to crepes to cakes for all occasions. Try one of the gelato and cake desserts sometime. \n \nNegatives? Maybe the coffee.. The espresso is just OK,  and could be improved. A ristretto shot, with nice thick crema Italian style would be awesome.  That's more a case of operator error than quality tho--you have to really really love espresso to make it well and most people operating an espresso machine don't know how to use it optimally.  \nI won't lower my rating by a full star based just on that tho, since it's a gelateria, not a cafe, and the gelato is definitely 5 stars. \n\nAlso, the location isn't great--I'm sure more people would know about it if it weren't in a less-travelled part of the Mission.

I had a bit of extra time before meeting my friend at the Marsh Theater so I stopped.  I ordered a strawberry cone, nothing exotic. I had a discussion with person who waited on my asking what the Spanish word for strawberry was.  I mean, I was in the MIssion, right?  And she was talking with a man and his young daughter in Spanish.  She told me fresa and I said, and it's fragola in Italian. I love all things Italian and speak some of the language. She smiled and said yes. I only noticed the extraordinary menu, restaurant history, and the owner's bio as I was happily munching my yummy cono alla fragola. I will be returning soon and often to try the other delicious creations.", "author": "Mauri S."}

The shop itself  is small: a small freezer next to the door showcases a few delights and the chalk menu offers crepes and smoothies to entrance your sweetooth. But the main event, ladies and gentlemen, is the gelato...and I'm telling you: it  BEGS to be sampled from behind its glass case.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-24", "description": "Lets start by saying that Copa Loca is getting 4 stars instead of 5 because it's been a while since we've had genuine, homemade Italian Gelato and thus the comparison is not quite fresh in our minds.  Having said that, with over 20 flavors, half of them dairy free and 3 of them involving chocolate/vanilla/coffee soy gelato, you almost can't go wrong.  Cowboy suggest using yogurt as a base, combined with a fruit flavor, for tangy tutti frutti bomby action.  My favorite is the coffee soy gelato (ask for it if you don't see it up front) with oreo toppings.  You can sample every single flavor you want to and they are open until 10pm almost every day.  Service is always super.  Fun fact: St. Francis uses their gelato for their soy shakes and La Victoria on 24st carries their gelato as well.  the end.", "author": "Katherine K."}

Not only did the owner give me samples of many flavors with great enthusiasm, the fruits (particularly melon and blood orange) were delicate and the soy chocolate was not only available but it was totally rich and amazing. Friend swears it's the best he's ever had, and now I've got a super local source for fresh creamy delights (not sexual).
