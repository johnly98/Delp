The male server came back about a minute later and asked if he could take our order, told him we weren't ready yet. \n\nA minute later as I'm staring at their menu the lady that brought the menus comes back and says \"You guys look ready.\" In my head I'm thinking 'I'm still looking at the menu, how does that look ready?' I looked up at her and asked for another minute.\n\nShe comes back literally a minute later. This time I'm holding the menu up to my face. I look up from the menu at her and she goes \"Ready?\" I shake my head, no. Can yall be patient please my goodness!\n\nGot the philly roll, creamy crab roll, and dragon roll. The philly was okay, nothing special. The salmon was not the freshest. The creamy crab roll was my least favorite which was disappointing cause that's the one I chose. Don't let the name fool you, there was nothing creamy about it, it was dry af. The dragon roll was the one I thought was bitter.\n\nWe also got the tempura combo appetizer. The shrimp was skinny and mushy like it wasn't fresh and the vegetable tempura was just shredded carrots, potatoes, and green beans. It was like a veggie hash brown. \n\nAfter we got our food the servers never attended to us again which was crazy cause they were on our backs about ordering in the first place. It was like they just wanted us to order our food and get it over with. The servers weren't rude but I just wasn't happy with their service.\n\nOn a positive note, the place was peaceful, quiet and not busy for Valentine's Day which I liked but I still wouldn't recommend going here on Valentine's Day..

A and I stopped in for a quick weeknight dinner following my Ulcer diagnosis from Golden Gate Urgent Care next door after figuring that plain raw fish was probably safe for me to eat.\n\nI opted for the Sushi Dinner Set ($16.95) which included numerous pieces of Nigiri, a Shitake Mushroom roll and a California roll with a Miso Soup. A went with the early bird special (served until 7pm) for ~$12 which came with his choice of 5 pieces of Nigiri, one of their speciality rolls (possibly the Valencia roll), seaweed salad, rice and Miso Soup.\n\nOur soups came first and to be honest, it wasn't too great. Definitely worse than average but still edible. Regardless, I was starving and just wanted some bland comfort food so this was fine. A's salad and rice also came with the soup which I just stared longingly at. Our fish arrived ~10 minutes later and honestly, the presentation was much better than I expected. Everything was well-plated and the cuts of fish were generous. We both dug in and were satisfied. Was the quality amazing? No. Was the fish insanely fresh? No. But it was definitely more than passable, especially considering the quantity for the price. This is one of the few times I feel like I have gotten a good value for sushi in SF and for that alone, this place deserves praise.\n\nI definitely feel like we will be back, especially as I can eat more of the menu shortly. This was the perfect meal for both of us on a busy weeknight. The menu includes plenty of non-sushi items as well so I can imagine this place gets busy. The space is a bit small and I didn't see anything larger than a 4-top so just something to keep in mind if you're planning on coming with a group.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Always great. \n\nLiving in Japan, I ate sushi from convenience stores several times. A couple times I got sick, and it was definitely the fish because that's all I threw up even though I also ate plenty of other stuff. THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED FROM WE BE SUSHI. (I have definitely gotten sick from a chinese place around the corner, though\")\n\nSan Francisco is part of that 'bubble' being talked about these days. Yes, even you who works for peanuts at a $6 cup coffee joint are in a bubble.\n\nWe Be, the southern one between 21st and 22nd, is still great. A couple of new staff since I wrote my last review and they're still courteous. I'm sure if you treat them like a member of Louis XVI's court you won't be on their good side.\n\nThink about it for a second, if you're mature enough to consider people other than yourself: this place has to earn income for quite expensive rent, utilities, SF minimum-wage salaries (and higher), AND the food. Fish you can eat raw is NOT cheap. Notice how FEW seats they've got. \n\nThe owners have found a price sweet-spot that can sell enough volume to stay open yet STILL attract locals. Locals who are only local because of rent control. Families who've lived here longer than you (most of you complainers) have been alive. Yes, every time I go in there are local people eating, not just 'poor' millenials from upper middle-class families.\n\nWe Be is not gourmet. If you've only eaten sushi in the US you probably have no idea what great sushi is, anyway. Stop being pretentious, especially when you come here and pay less than $5 a roll!

I will say, I went in at 9:15, which is not too far off from closing time, so I guess everyone's tired... But that is not a good enough excuse for how awful this experience was.\n\nWhen I walked in, there were 7 others dining, a group of four, a table of two and one girl by herself.  The girl by herself had just gotten her dish when I was walking in, and she was hesitant I could tell, but called the waitress back over and gently stated it wasn't at all what she had ordered.  They gave her some sort of variety platter but she had just ordered a tuna sashimi.  She even told them they didn't have to replace it, and said \"no no its fine, I mean I already touched this.  It's fine, just not what I ordered.\"  She looked pretty annoyed though.\n\nThey took about 2 minutes to even LOOK at me, and the restaurant is teeny tiny, so literally everyone else was starting to stare at me by the time they sat me down.  The waitress that seated me didn't give me a menu, I assumed she'd be right back with one, but she wasn't.  I sat and waited for about 5 minutes before the other waitress came over, and the first thing out of her mouth was, \"Wow, did she really seat you and not give you a menu?  Ridiculous.\"  And she went away again with a huff to go get me a menu.  Now of course I appreciate that she was trying to help, but she didn't apologize or anything, it sounded less of a \"gosh I'm sorry about that, let me help\" and more of a \"ugh I have to walk ALL the way back over here because of my stupid coworker\".  I haven't ever witnessed anyone complain about their coworker like that to a customer.  She didn't apologize or say even a hello.\n\nShe asked me what I wanted, I ordered the Chirashi with miso soup.  When the waitress brought the miso soup, she didn't bring me any sort of spoon... But I was too timid to ask as I could tell she was in an awful mood, so I sipped my soup from the bowl.  Taste wise the soup was fine.\n\nWhen my Chirashi came, the fish was HORRIBLY prepared.  It was as if the chef had never cut fish for sushi before.  Each piece was falling apart.  Worse yet, not a single piece tasted fresh, and half of the bites I took tasted like the fish was straight from the freezer.  I swear I felt the crunch of biting into ICE on one of the pieces.  It was shockingly awful.  There was a piece of mackerel that had skin on it still, and it was so POORLY prepped that I actually took a picture and sent it to people saying \"look how awful this is\".  Also, the shrimp was not only obviously straight from the freezer, but it still had bits of tail on it, that I didn't see as most had been removed.  I ended up having to reach inside my full mouth and pull out the bits.  It was disgusting.  Total amateur hour in regards to the fish prep.\n\nWhile eating, there was a lovely soundtrack playing right behind me of the waitress complaining to some of the customers about how she'd \"been working ALLLLLL DAY and just couldn't WAIT to get off, it's just been an AWFUL, LONG day.\"  The customers looked like they really just wanted her to walk away so they could eat..  She was checking her watch every few moments as well, in front of the customers, as if to say \"eat fast, guys! I'm trying to go home here!\"\nThe other waitress who had originally sat me without a menu left, and as she was leaving, the waitress I've been ranting about here shouts out the door after her, \"hey next time, why don't you come in ready to work?  That would be GREAT\" in an extremely sarcastic tone.  It was unbelievable that she did that in front of everyone.\n\nShe came to clear my dishes, and I hadn't finished everything... I didn't particularly want to, besides maybe the miso soup.  But I didn't even have the luxury of choosing whether or not to finish because she didn't ask if I was done, and just cleared my plates right away.  When she brought the check AND after collecting it, she didn't say a word.  The entire time I was there, I said thank you probably at least 6 or 7 times because that's what a proper midwest raised girl has been taught to do, and yet she didn't say thank you ONCE.  Not a single pleasantry was uttered from her mouth whatsoever, actually.  I said goodnight to myself and left as fast as I could.  I will NEVER eat here again, and I officially have no shame anymore directing people straight across the street to the WONDERFUL Sugoi Sushi, which I was actually planning to eat at had it not been closed.\n\nThank you We Be for an incredibly good opportunity to write an awful yelp review.  At least I have cleared up whether or not to ever eat at We Be Sushi ever again- a resounding NO!!  I'm keeping my yelp tab open in case I get food poisoning from the not-at-all-fresh fish, because I almost expect to at this point.", "author": "Haley G."}

It was extremely uncomfortable for us, and troubling. When we told the server we didn't want to be involved in her vendetta she got huffy and barked at the other woman to pick up our check. No hard feelings toward We Be on our part, but we just feel that management should be aware that this type of harassment is going on under their roof.", "author": "Liza S."}

When we arrived there was only one other customer at the restaurant, and he had already been served. We sat down and placed our order. The waiter was nice enough, my complaints are not about him. The sushi chef received the order from our waiter, and he just walked away from the sushi bar! One of my kids had ordered chicken, and that came out right away.  But there were 4 of us, and obviously we wanted to eat at the same time. We sat around for about 15 minutes, waiting for someone to start preparing our sushi order. The waiter said nothing, noone acknowledged that we were being ignored. Finally a new chef came out and prepared his whole sushi prep setup. That took about another 10 minutes. The old sushi chef returned, and one of them finally made our order. By the time our sushi was delivered, the chicken was cold and we were in horrible moods. We ended up waiting almost 30 minutes from order to eat!  With noone else even in the restaurant!

The vegetarian dinner shows major imagination, not simply being a sop so vegans will join their non-vegan friends.  There are two nigiris (avacado and cucumber), rice wrapped with tofu skin, and mushrooms just spilling out of a rice and seaweed wrap, plus an eggplant maki. If I'm extra-hungry, I get a squash maki as well. Essentially, it's a vegan tasting menu.\n\nTasty and interesting. Good show. I wouldn't eat here every week, but the dish is interesting enough that I can enjoy it a couple times a month.\n\nAs a side note, due to switching to being 95% vegan, I've been re-trying places that I had given up so long ago I've forgotten why. The first time I went back to We Be Sushi after years and years, I noticed that in the few front tables there were signs \"Non-smoking section\" inlaid into the tables.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9kqooKOcH_o-KuumqAGIpQ?select=5f2TExWQ35mFtpJpOGEbJg) It was definitely busy in there but our food and beverages came out fairly swiftly. Their complimentary miso soup was hot and not too salty...great way to start our meal!\n\nspider roll ($8.50) - Decent amount of the deep fried soft shell crab...was interesting since there was spinach and carrots in the middle of the roll. Not bad though since each piece was bigger than just a bite size.\n\none of a kind roll ($8.50) - Consisted of shrimp tempura and spicy tuna...simple enough but a little too much rice and the tuna was almost nonexistent. I swear I just tasted the spiciness but didn't see any fish...did we get jipped?\n\ncatch of the day roll ($4.75) - Unique twist on a fresh salmon roll since the meat was marinated in sake and dill first. The salmon was refreshing with a hint of tartness but the flavor may take some getting used to. This was my fave out of all the rolls though...yummy!\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9kqooKOcH_o-KuumqAGIpQ?select=rMmEppo-KnYHpA4yufEmoA)\n\ncaterpillar roll ($8.50) - Pretty typical caterpillar roll with unagi and cucumber wrapped in avocado but disappointed there was no special sauce for it. Just like the one of a kind roll, waaaay too much rice and avocado, tiny piece of unagi. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9kqooKOcH_o-KuumqAGIpQ?select=l4FPiYiuujZgR4QHFOxjhg)\n\nOverall, I liked how the rice was sticky/soft so that the sushi didn't fall apart as easily. Everything did taste fresh but the ratio from one ingredient to another may have been off. I definitely filled up on all that rice though!\n\nYou get what you pay for I guess. The rolls were modestly sized but also really cheap for sushi. Their roll choices were pretty extensive and also offer nigiri, maki, sashimi, udon, and combo specials. I would be willing to come back to try their other options. Cash only!", "author": "Karen Y."}

The sushi special which is something like a WeBe roll (cucumber, eel (?) and cream cheese) and four pieces of assorted nigiri is good for $7.50.  A small sample of fish and a decent roll for a pretty good price and might I add without the lame ol boring California roll.  I also had the chicken teriyaki special to really round things out.  It's quite an opulent dish served with rice, tomatoes, cabbage salad and a generous serving of chicken.  The chicken was ok; tasty but a little dry at times.  At $7.50 I couldn't really complain.  Both dishes came with a new favorite which was the Japanese spinach salad.  It's essentially like seaweed salad though I found it less \"saucy\".  Easily one of the better ways I've had spinach prepared without making it taste like it's health value is gone. \n\nThe restaurant had the other intangibles.  The space is nice and cozy, definitely a great spot if you're looking to catch up with an old friend in a not too noisy atmosphere.

Our waitress was accomodating and sweet.  Although the mariachi band the filled the small establishment with their tinny wails for 15 minutes kind of put a damper on the conversations/inner thought process of humans.  I kind of wish the staff at We Be Sushi had maybe not let them in.  But then again, I just moved to The Mission, so for all I know mariachi bands are to SF what the Sopranos are to NJ, and the owners of We Be Sushi owe them a favor.\n\nAnyway, my anger at the meal was 99% a result of the \"food.\"  The tuna sushi was stringy, and the little nub of rice it was laying upon lacked cohesiveness and fell apart at the touch of my chopsticks.  And the house roll...I have no idea what it was.  Perhaps some sort of fish jerky and cream cheese and oshinko?  It tasted like a cat treat.  It was so contrived and dressed up and not even close to what I expect when I go out to eat sushi.  (My friend ordered a roll with Parmesan cheese!  Ew!)\n\nWhile my entire meal, plus Beer, only cost me $10, I was sorely dissappointed and pretty grossed out.

I tend to steer clear of anything involving dairy in my asian cuisine (never quite figured out the whole mayo-in-the-maki craze), and aside from a Philadelphia roll and something else on the menu I can't remember they comply.\n\nIt's a great place to call ahead and get an order to take home. Their sashimi is well priced and I'm never afraid to eat it.\n\nHow does that warrant 4 stars you ask? For someone who's busy and likes a quick takeout meal after work, We-Be Sushi in six years has never let me down. It's the only place I know I can spend $10 at  sushi joint and feel full and leave without getting food poisoning. It's a nice break from all the burrito joints in that neck of the woods. Maybe you'll think my standards are low, but I've got nothing but love for this sushi joint.", "author": "Patrice S."}

So I asked around the office, \"sushi, with one condition-- cheap AND good, not either/or, please.\" I was repeatedly pointed in the direction of We Be Sushi. \n\nThe place is small, as in like 9 tables, and in a hip-but-still-pretty-shady section of the Mission. Two words to describe my overall experience-- pleasantly suprised. The service was great, the selection was pretty sushi joint standard (with some interesting exceptions) and the fish was mmm mmm fresh. \n\nWasn't hot on the salmon-dill-sake marinated roll I ordered, since the dill overpowered the fish. And the spicy creamy crab roll was pretty much just a California roll, but spicy. But oh to be redeemed by the himachi, raw fish of the Japanese gods. Creamy, light and lemony. Goodness. Note to self, note to Yelpers: come back and order lots of sashimi and nigri, skip the rolls.\n\nAs we were exiting the restaurant, a couple walked by us and looked up at the We Be Sushi sign, with it's 7-UP logo and fading letters. \"Looks cheesy,\" the girl commented. \"Totally,\" the guy replied.

It's as cheap as it gets for sushi in San Francisco (or just about anywhere in US for that matter). \n\nLet's be reasonable now -- you can't expect the best-in-town level sushi at this price (both in terms of freshness of ingredients or in the quality of preparation), but what you do get is better than what I expected at the price; the fish portions are generously cut, and the preparation is solid.\n\nBesides the favorable quality-to-price ratio, the atmosphere is also something to note.  This is a tiny place with seating for 20-30, but it's not necessarily a bare-bones hole-in-the-wall; this location has a grungy-artsy decor with oversized Japanese print banners and random relics and deocrations -- an overall fun atmosphere in my book, but some might prefer the sedated and clean mood of the location just several blocks down Valencia (this location also has a few more items on the menu, such as chirashi).  There's also no sushi-bar here (you know, the refrigerated glass case, bar seating, row of sushi chefs, etc.) -- the food is prepared around what looks like a small buffet table.  It's a casual place.\n\nI found the place in a San Francisco guide book (one of those titles that promises to reveal the 'untouristy' side of SF), and I've taken the BART from my hotel in Union Square to 16th/Mission, then walked 20 minutes to get here (I'm a bit of a foodie).

I was pleased at the 15 minute wait, which was about 15 minutes.  Usually you go somewhere and 15 minutes can mean 30 depending on the restaurant and the night.\n\nUnfortunately, since there was a man sitting in front of the menu most of the time we were waiting outside, we failed to see the \"CASH ONLY\" sign until 2 minutes before we were seated.  So, I was seated while my partner made a mad dash to the ATM.  That sign REALLY needs to be bigger.\n\nInside, I noticed that there were quite a few tables that were placed only a few inches away from each other because of the size of the restaurant - and I was immediately seated next to a young boy and what looked like his mother.  He was talking loudly on his cell phone, so I was lucky when I was able to move to a table on the opposite wall where there wasn't another table two inches from me!\n\nAnyway, my dining partner returned and we ordered small beers.  He ordered tuna and I ordered the chicken dinner.  He said that his tuna tasted like it had been swimming in the holding tank too long and that it was still a little frozen in the middle - even though it should have been served at room temperature.  As for my dinner, I liked my miso soup and I really enjoyed the rice.  The chicken was a little crispy on the outside but really tender.  There was a large portion of salad that had a tangy citrus dressing that was tasty.  My partner and I were able to share my dinner with only a little salad left over.\n\nThere were GOOD elements to our dinner: like the cold beer, wall decorations, and my chicken dinner.\n\nThings I would PASS on again if I had the chance:  the restaurant being so small, the sushi, and their cash only policy.", "author": "Heather S."}

Not the place for fancy towering sushi concoctions... The rolls are smallish, so order ~3 for a decent size meal. Most of them are $3-4, so it's super affordable.\n\nOddly, just recently they started using random corporate mugs instead of the Japanese-looking ones they usually had, and the free appetizer is carrot sticks in a cup, which is kind of hilariously lame, but for the price we're not complaining.\n\nThe waitresses aren't chatty or anything, but they respond to questions in a friendly manner and let us know that there was fish-stock in the miso soup after noticing that my boyfriend had ordered all vegetarian items. They've got a nice variety of vegetarian items, which is not exactly easy to find, having looked at other sushi joints in the city. I love the avocado rolls!", "author": "Jin Z."}

The mackerel was had a light, buttery taste without the over-fishiness that often comes with mackerel.  It wasn't over-cooked to the point where you see charred/hard edges and the meat was fluffy.

The sushi was pretty mediocre and in the middle of our meal a couple of guys came in to play guitar and sing some Mexican tunes VERY LOUDLY. I guess they were just practicing their trade, but this place is so tiny that it was appallingly awkward to continue eating while listening to the almost deafening music. I don't fault We Be Sushi for that... I guess. I fault them for poor sushi, though. Won't do this one again.", "author": "Lili L."}

I liked the Tropical roll, although it was hard to taste anything other than the smoked salmon skin.  Once in a while a bit of mango flavour would sneak in, but not as much as I would have hoped.  The white tuna wasn't that great; it was really fishy tasting.  The mackerel was also fishy tasting, but in that way that cheap mackerel is indeed fishy tasting, which I happen to like, so I did enjoy the mackerel.\n\nThe lady working there was super sweet, and brought me hot tea while I waited for my take out.  The place is pretty small and narrow, so it didn't look like it would be good for groups greater than 4 or so.  The early bird special looks intriguing, I'll definitely be back to try that some time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-29", "description": "Has anyone else noticed that everyone with anything to say about a sushi restaurant turns into a fucking snob? Like all of a sudden everybody's a self-proclaimed sushi connoisseur. Seriously, every time a sushi spot enters the conversation, all I ever hear is how \"it's not very good\" qualified with some other modifier like, \"it's cheap\" or \"it's convenient.\" The majority of reviews for We Be Sushi pretty much follow this exact formula of food criticism. But let's cut the crap because your average American doesn't know the first thing about sushi and likely neither does your average sushi chef given that more than eighty percent of Japanese restaurants (including sushi restaurants) in the United States are not authentically owned and operated by Japanese. That makes the odds of your average American's exposure to, and much less expertise of, the ancient and traditional art of sushi preparation quite unlikely. At least that's the rationale behind my consideration (or lack thereof) of people's attitudes about WeBe. Americans invented fast food for chrissake, so quit it with all the pretension to gourmandism already. Where's every self-taught gourmet when you need a recommendation for Ethiopian or French cuisine in the City? Most of these people would readily admit that they don't know where the fuck Addis Ababa is from Provence on a map before they chime in with their two cents about shitty Japanese food. You're cheap and you're hungry right? Then WeBe does the trick.", "author": "Jenn W."}

And the even sadder part of this is that it's almost entirely due to the incredibly awful service.  \n\nThe funny thing is that  we've always liked the service, but I'm thinking it must have to do with the night of week you go.  We always went on weekends before and we always had the soft spoken Japanese lady who wears her hair in pigtails. She's so nice! But last night was a Wednesday and we had possibly the worst waitress I've ever had in my life (okay that might be a stretch but you get the point).  First she brought our drinks to the wrong table.  Then she got visibly flustered and mad at me when I mistakenly asked for the \"dinner special\" instead of by its real name which escapes me now.  She also brought both of our dinners on the SAME plate. I don't have a problem with sharing space, but this just seemed bizarre and lazy on her end.  My boyfriend's explanation for her attitude and slip-ups was because she was too busy but I beg to differ-- have you seen this place? My bathroom is bigger (not exactly but you get what I'm saying) so I can't buy the \"too busy\" B.S.  And I also didn't appreciate her sudden wave of friendliness as we were finishing up.  This made her appear shallow and patronizing-- subtle acknowledgment of the badness without any substance to make it better.\n\nThe bill came to an almost even $20. I left a $3 tip.  I wish I could go back in time and subtract another dollar. Sounds harsh but thats how much she sucked guys!  As far as the food goes, you get what you pay for...its pretty inexpensive so of course its not going to be the best sushi the city has to offer. Last night seemed more mediocre than usual, very possibly due to the bad taste in my mouth courtesy of miss you-know-who.  I also don't care for cream cheese in my sushi and unfortunately that's the only kind they give you with the meal I ordered. It's pretty weak that you can't choose the kind of roll you want. \n\nOh, and one more thing...as I was lying in bed last night, pondering the lameness, I realized she never brought my miso soup!", "author": "L.
