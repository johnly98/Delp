Went on a Friday night at 7pm and it wasn't busy when I first arrived, but the place started getting very busy as I was eating.\n\nLomo Saltado: 3/5 I love the idea of putting french fries together with a stir fry, but the sauce does make the fries soggy if you leave them in too long. I wouldn't have necessarily minded this, but the sauce is very salty. I didn't touch my rice until halfway throughout my meal, but in hindsight, I think it would've been better to mix the rice in the sauce early on so that the sauce doesn't overpower everything else. Otherwise, the tomatoes, onions, and steak were cooked very well and the texture was great! Super tasty overall, just overwhelmingly salty\n\nPisco Sour: 5/5 Everything about this drink is delicious! The egg white makes the drink have a rich, smooth texture, which makes it go down real easy. The flavor is a perfect balance of sour/tartness, and it's not too strong. \n\nService was pretty good for how busy it was. Our waitress was professional, polite, and attentive. It took a while to get our check, but otherwise no complaints.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

They're pretty empty for brunch (my boyfriend and I were the only ones there at around 11:15am on a Sunday), but they do pretty well on a Friday night. \n\nFor dinner, my boyfriend and I shared a ceviche (the one that has everything)-- although the seafood seemed quite fresh, it was a bit too sour for our taste. We both think that really good ceviche shouldn't be too sour, because if it is, you're essentially hiding the real, fresh taste of the seafood. I would give their ceviche a 2/5. We also had their plantain chips, which were a solid 4/5. \n\nThey ran out of the dish that I wanted originally (mussels with chorizo), so I opted for the cold salad-like appetizer made out of potatoes, crab, avocado, and some other goodies. My boyfriend had their lamb, and it was humongous! The meat was really tender. \n\nAs for brunch, I've had their chicken hash. There were hardly any potatoes in it-- I found only 3 or 4 cubes. I wish they gave me a bit more. As for the shredded chicken, it was quite dry, unfortunately. I'm glad I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side because I didn't like it at all when I tried some of it. My boyfriend enjoyed their Eggs Julianna though. \n\nI would recommend coming here for dinner, but there are definitely some better options for brunch in the area.", "author": "Christina W."}

We ordered via Caviar and scheduled the delivery to arrive between 11:30am and 12pm. Our order didn't arrive until a little before 12:30pm on Friday, August 4th. Not sure if it was a lag with Caviar or Fresca, but at least it wasn't super late.\n\n*Pollo A La Brasa (Lunch): Marys farm free range herb encrusted rotisserie chicken served with crispy kenebec french fries ($16)\n*Lechon Asado: Pulled pork, mango aji sauce, jack cheese, coleslaw, tomato, and toasted Dutch crunch bread, French fries ($14)\n\nI ordered the chicken while I shared the sandwich with another coworker. The chicken was a hefty portion at half a whole bird. I only ate the thigh the first day which was nice and juicy. The salad was also good and pretty big for a side salad. I know fries don't travel well, so these were just okay. Kinda soggy when they got to our office. The sandwich was a nice way to try their pulled pork. I could have passed on it though as I didn't think it was very flavorful. Especially after having the yummy chicken first. One of my coworkers ordered the empanadas which ended up being smaller than she thought. Not enough for a full meal. That's why we ended up sharing the sandwich as the person who ordered it wasn't in the office that day.\n\nFresca ended up being a hit at work.

Having been for both Happy Hour (numerous times) and Brunch (once), I have never been disappointed nor impressed. It seems that other diners agree with me since any time I have ever been, it is not busy. Their prices are high, especially for dinner. However, Happy Hour (3-6pm in the bar) is a good deal if you are in the neighborhood as they have many discounted cocktails like Pisco Sours, Pisco Punches, Sangria, Wine and Beer as well as quite a few appetizers at a good price.\n\nThe focus of this review is on my latest visit which was for Brunch this past Sunday. A and I arrived at 11AM (at peak Brunch hour) to a completely empty restaurant. It was pouring outside which probably explains it, but it was still surprising. We ordered our food and probably received our order within 20 minutes which is reasonable. We ate:\n\n-Chicken Hash ($14): This was mine. It was so bland and watery. I ordered it because I wanted something hearty yet healthy and while this may have fit the bill, I was not impressed. It was served with a Chili Hollandaise which I asked for on the side with no intention of using it. I ended up pouring it on, even though I REALLY hate Hollandaise because there was no spice to any of it.\n\n-Pancakes ($12):  This is what A had and they were...weird. Definitely not traditional and they came topped with plantains and what looked like cranberries. They were good but be warned that these do not taste like the pancakes you can get anywhere else.\n\nThe food was fine. The service was fine. The check was, in our opinion, expensive for some place that is clearly not bringing in Brunch crowds. Will we be back? Sure, we are in the neighborhood. Chances are though, we will only be back for Happy Hour as there are too many other good options for every other possible eating/drinking occasion in Noe.", "author": "Carrie W."}

If you're looking for a less basic and conventional and more interesting brunch menu flavor-wise, then Fresca is the perfect spot for you. It's also not overwhelmingly crowded with an annoying wait time on Sunday. When we went around 1PM on Sunday, it was pretty empty with the exception of a few tables, which was fine by us since we were looking for a chiller environment. \n\nCeviche sampler - great presentation and variety of fish and seafood (scallops, shrimp, etc). It was slightly on the saltier side but enjoyed tasting all the different flavors and it was a great start to the meal.\n\nSweet potato fries - the best I've ever had. Fried to crispy perfection and served with a deliciously creamy sauce. Also loved the chimichurri sauce that came with the yuca fries. Asked for more of both sauces and they were happy to oblige.\n\nToro steak salad - so simple but absolutely packed with flavor and it's a fresh and healthy yet hearty option. The steak was grilled to medium and very tender and juicy. The vinaigrette is slightly tangy and adds a ton of flavor to the whole dish. \n\nThey also do offer a few traditional brunch items like Benedicts and such, if you're looking for that.

I finally got up and asked the manager for the same sause and she brought it right away.

Good food but nothing amazing. \n\nCame with a friend for brunch on a Sunday around 10:30am. We made reservations beforehand because well, it's SF, but it turned out we didn't need to. The place was completely empty when we got there, which might make it seem like the food's not good or something, but for someone like me who hates lines and waiting, it was perfect. By the time we left around 11:30, there were a few other people, but it seems like Fresca might be more of a lunch or dinner spot rather than brunch. Good for a quiet brunch though!\n\nMy friend ordered the Crab Omelet ($16), which he said he enjoyed, while I ordered the Linda Mar Omelet ($16), which was tasty but a little heavier than I would've liked for an omelet. Both came with potatoes. The Linda Mar didn't specify so on the menu, so when the waitress brought out my order and I saw the potatoes that I didn't know I had and that I didn't want, I asked if I could substitute for a side salad instead. She obliged, probably unhappily and probably annoyed at me.. Otherwise, service was rather lacking. The waitress didn't seem very friendly even before I bothered her about the potatoes, and no one was particularly welcoming in general.\n\n-LINDA MAR OMELET ($16) - 4/5\n[seafood and shellfish open face omelet, \"chupe\" sauce, jack cheese, avocado]\nPretty solid. The omelet was cooked nicely with the cheese melted inside and was topped with  a decent portion of seafood (shrimp, octopus, scallop) and a few slices of avocado. The waitress described the chupe sauce as a tomato sauce, but it reminded me more of a sauce you'd find in a Spanish seafood stew or paella. It was pretty flavorful and light in consistency, but made the omelet pretty heavy because of all the oil in the sauce.", "author": "Jessie L."}

I've been coming here for sometime, both here and the lower Pac Height version, both are good. \n\nIts traditional Peruvian food is great to share, as it's huge in proportion. Peruvian food was very in in the early ots, for those who could remember. La Mar's opening in the Embarcadero had made Peruvian food hip, I used to attend their wine pairing chef's table special, 10/15 years ago, when ceviche was quite an in thing. But I believe Fresca had been on the scene before La Mar's big entrance, and it has first introduced San Franciscans to Peruvian food, and from that aspect of it, it was more of a pioneer.\n\nOn this particular outing, the girlfriends and I were celebrating the holidays. We've been friends for nearly 2 decades. Once hip professional Marina and SoMa chicks, always will be, in some ways, I suppose. Because even though time has passed, youth had been preserved in our collective memories. As youth, we liked dining here, and therefore, it holds a special place for us.\n\nFor chicken, the stew is very good. Pork shoulder dish is huge and require a mandatory split between two people, that's for sure. The fried whole fish is spicy and creamy. Pork chops are more continental to me, somehow, and is good if you want to stay off on the sauce.\n\nWe always get a few tapas dishes to start, and wine is always good, as are their cocktails.\n\nI don't understand what makes a restaurant a three or fours on Yelp. I think this has always been a solid 4. I suspect some of it has to do with how long it's been around and whether it's popular among a certain set of clientele. For me, it holds somewhat a sentimental value, more importantly, it holds greater sentimental value with my lady friends. We grew up together, as young 20 somethings, we had gone to every party in the city together, crawled all the bars on Union Street, drank more bloodies than we can count every Sunday morning on Chestnut street, and cried over and over again for those boyfriends who broke our hearts, and yet, here we are, middle aged and more self assured than ever, still gathering in the same spots as we once did, on occasion. But now we are talking about Under Armor undies for the boys, the latest princess obsessions for the girls, and for some of us, middle and high school curriculums for the children who now need to wear deodorants. \n\nSomethings change, somethings don't.

Granted I've only had Peruvian food a couple of times, but everything I had was delicious!\n\nRecommend: \n\n- CEVICHE Chifa - 4 stars!  Great taste, like poke.  But small for $13\n\n- PLANTAIN CHIPS to scoop the ceviche!! - 4.5 stars, $5. Definitely recommend getting this with ceviche!!\n\n- LOMO SALTADO - 4.5 stars, $20 - good thing my friend and I split this dish, because it was the right portion when we did!  Mmm sauteed tender beef with friends and rice.  It was delicious.  I believe this beef is marinated in soy sauce, vinegar, and peruvian spices. I highly recommend!  \n\n- PISCO SOUR - 5 stars, $11 - 1 delicious drink that got me buzzed. Now that, gets 5 stars in my book. I've found a new favorite drink. \n\nOVERALL: Delicious Peruvian food, expect average price for food and drinks to be around $35 including tax+tip.

And there's where the trouble began. \n\nMy friend and I ordered lunch. I also ordered some food for later. I clearly stated it was for later so there was no need to wait to prepare it, I'd just like to get it when I leave. I was told this would be no problem. \n\nWhen the check came it was just the items we had for lunch, so that required a void and a re-bill. Then there was a delay because one of the items was \" taking just a little bit longer.\"  I asked for the meals to be ready, sat through a lunch and had received the bill. The restaurant was not even close to busy. So why would these items not be ready?\n\nNew bill comes, and we continue to wait at the table. At this point I'm already going to be late for a meeting because this has taken 15 more than expected. I can see that the waiter is trying to expedite it, but in the end, what likely happened is that he forgot to put the order in to begin with. \n\nI can't imagine why a to-go order made at the beginning of the meal still wasn't ready until 15 min after the end of the meal. No apology, no admission. Just given the order and told thanks. \n\nI'm now 15 min late for my next meet. I'm annoyed, but I'd eat here again.

Lets go over how Noe Valley Fresca won us over. \n\nUpon walking in Arm and Arm with my dining companion (and fellow foodie) we noticed the strikingly different decor. This location has a very soft, dimly lit feel yet has warm and inviting colours. \n\nThe tables are pushed a little close together, and this is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. I've got runners legs and a nice badunkadunk and I hate awkwardly squeezing between two tables, trying not to disturb the other patrons. So, I made my Food Companion squish through instead. \n\nGlancing over the menu it had the expected and usual fare.\n\nWe ordered the Trio Ceviche and it was beautiful when it hit the table. I've become quite informative and picky about my ceviche over the years and I must say THIS was a great fusion. It was  fresh, tender and FULL of flavor, each distinctly different! Our server recommended the Ceviche de CoCo and I too would recommend it as long as you pair it with the Ceviche 2 Elementos. The CoCo is sweet and Elementos is very tangy with a kick, perfect pair!\n\nMy entree was the Lenguado. The fish was cooked perfectly as were the clams and mussels (and neither were gritty thank goodness!) The sauce had a rich smoking flavour. Again.. I was impressed.\n\nMy fellow food snob had the usual Lomo Saltado. We have had MANY Lomo Saltado's over the years, but this ranks second on our list. The meat was rich in flavour, tender and was not over powered by the sauce. Even the tomatos were infused with amazing flavor! \n\nDrinks from the bar were fantastic, strong, and yummy. \n\nOur server Maria was so friendly and so polite. She was very informative and didn't hesitate when we asked her opinion on the menu. GREAT JOB MARIA!\n\nOver all this place was great and completely uplifted our view on this Fresca establishment.", "author": "Meghan L."}

Not only did the food disappoint,  it also did not have the generosity typical of Peru. If you eat there, you could like it if you are not familiar with what we call Peruvian Food. Sorry about this negative report but I just want you to expect more from a place that started well over 20 years ago. When Fresca opened in the Filmore, it was not the best but was decent. FINA ESTAMPA in the Mission was then a great Peruvian restaurant. Alejandro was also a fabulous restaurant in the Sunset district. That really was great even though it did not call itself Peruvian but the \"sason\" was there. It ended when it relocated in the Mission. Try La Parada in Walnut Creek or in Oakland El Tambo.

They were quite busy so we ended up in the middle of the restaurant by the oyster bar.\n\nFresca has very special cocktails and pisco drinks. Our friend darrell couldn't remember what he had last time. A scrutiny of the drink menu nailed down to the Benito-jito---a twist of the Mojito with blueberries. Both my BF and Darrell had this drink. I wasn't as venturesome, and as befit a creature of habit, I opted for the regular cosmopolitan which, to my surprised delight, was very good for $8. Over the cocktails we had:\n\n*Plantanos Fritos ($5): fried plantains with sour cream on the side. Not wat I expected. It's not crunchy. Can be skipped.\n\n*Camerones Chicama ($12): coconut crusted prawns. Tempura tiger prawns with shredded coconut batter. Crispy and crunchy, not too over-done and batter is thin. Served with a mango-y dip. A bit steeped for 3 prawns but worth it.\n\nSince this is not our first time eating here, the boys ordered exactly what they had last time:\n\n*Pollo de la Brasa ($19): half Mary's rotisserie chicken with fries and mixed greens salad. Chicken here is not as flavored and spiced at Limon, but equally tender and tasty. \n\n*Lomito Saltado ($20): slices of tenderloin beef sauteed with soy sauce, tomato, onion with fries. Served with white rice. Good and flavorful. Beef is tender.\n\n*Salmon ($23): this is my main course and is a huge delight. Because I always cook salmon at home so i almost never get salmon when I eat out---until I see that this is served with rice cooked in octopus ink. Very delicious, rice soaked up the juice with a garlicy flavor. Absolutely one of the best seafood dishes I've had.\n\nService was a bit \"too attentive\", we were rushed through our appetizers. I have to say this because this is not uncommon in San Francisco. Restaurants often try to take our appetizer plates before we're even done with them. Can't they just leave them on the table when main courses are served?\n\nAnyway, good food and good drinks. Nice atmosphere.", "author": "Matt Y."}

In fact, the service here is FANTASTIC.  F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C.  And I'm not just staying that because of the free sangria on a Friday night after a long, long week.  The wait staff was cheery and attentive despite being pulled in what seemed like a hundred different directions.  Plus, I reasoned with myself, the long wait must say something about the food.\n\nAlas, I was fooled.  Or maybe I've just been in SF too long and my standards for good food are ridiculously high.  Either way, I was disappointed.  *sniffles *\n\nThe ceviche was pales in comparison to ceviche at Limon Rotisserie and especially in comparison to the ceviche at Lolinda (my current gold standard).  My green paella was disappointing when compared to the cilantro rice at Arriba Peru in Berkeley.  Yes, paella isn't just cilantro rice; it's so much more, with the accompanying assortment of seafood.  That's exactly my point, though.  It had so much more to work with, and couldn't even satisfy my tummy on the same level.  For shame.  \n\nThe great service means that I'll potentially go back and give this place another chance.

I had never tried Peruvian food before and was excited to give it a try. We started with the ceviche sampler appetizer (50% of all appetizers on Wednesday nights!) The sampler came with four different types of ceviche each with different types of seafoods and flavors and they were all equally delicious! \n\nAs my main course I ordered the Swordfish skewers. The portion was smaller than a typical main course although it was actually the perfect amount of food after having the ceviche. (I find most restaurants serve way more food than necessary and I usually end up uncomfortably full.) The swordfish was very melt-in-your-mouth and the sauce that came on the side complimented the swordfish nicely. The yuca fries and the small pieces of grilled corn made it feel like a complete meal.\n\nOverall the food and service was excellent and I'd like to come back again (maybe on the BYOB with free wine corkage fee night.)  However, I did feel the food was a little overpriced.. My smaller entree cost $14 or $15 and the ceviche sampler appetizer would have cost $24 (if we had paid full price.)

No one with that much anger and that unprofessional should be in the customer service industry.  We initially had a reservation for a party of 8, when we checked in we said 6 now, maybe 5 (but still, just set a table for six, not a big deal).  She put two tables together for six people and the three chairs didn't fit side by side.  So I placed one chair on the end and she got 'huffy' and reluctantly placed another table next to the two.  (Yes, that is how you set a table for six).  We mentioned two, maybe one, in our party were running late and she said if only 5 were coming she'd need to REMOVE a table.  I explained that I was unsure how many people would be coming and finally she back off.  Mind you the entire restaurant was EMPTY!!!!  EMPTY!!!\n\nOh, I totally forgot, initially the table that was for us, was still occupied after the time for our reservation and she made us wait.  It wasn't until we stood in front of the hostess station that she got us another table.  Again, I must repeat, THE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY!!!!\n\nI have NO idea why this woman is in this position, perhaps the restaurant was extremely desperate for someone.  \n\nSecond, the waiter (who was excellent) then told us there was NO chicken dishes available.  Really?

Peruvian is one of my favorite kinds of food.

Only to be seated and was given a whole different menu. Shouldn't THAT menu be posted outside?\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS\n\n**see pictures**\n\nFree Bread - They have a local baker who makes these mini ball breads every morning and delivers here. SO GOOD. I can eat an entire basket to myself.\n\nRaw Oysters - \nMalpaque (nova scotia) - $2.50/pc. never had this oyster before. tonight will be a \"new taste\" night. when the tray came out, the shape of the malpaque was smaller and oval. they tasted pretty good and really liked it. way different then the fanny bay oyster.\n\nFanny Bay (british columbia) - $2/pc. never had this oyster before either. i was going to order some blue points but they were out so ordered this based on the suggest it is very similar to blue points. tasted it and loved the first taste but the after taste reminds me of oysters from washington; they have that sea/beach like taste (and i am not talking about a uni kind of taste either). \n\nAji de Gallina ($18)- pulled chicken stew, aji amarillo cream, yukon potatoes, soft-boiled eggs, walnuts, steamed rice. I always go to the same Peruvian restaurant and eat everything on their menu. This is a my first time straying away from my favorite Peruvian restaurant and trying another. I never seen this before and decided to try something new. WHY NOT! It was pretty good. Kind of spicy, creamy, and a hint of cheese but not cheese just the taste of the cream. I was fond of the potatoes and walnuts in the dish and how it brought in texture and made the dish tastier in its own way, wish they had more potatoes in smaller chunks. However, wasn't a fond of the boiled eggs. I don't know what that brought to the dish but just having boiled eggs floating next to the rice. I couldn't finish it all and had packed half of it to go. \n\nWill I be back? Maybe. I still like my favorite Peruvian restaurant across town. but if i do I know what to order here.

I loved it! The portion was generous and the flavors were nothing short of amazing. DELICIOUS! My service was excellent...For my meal and service,  I would give them 5 STARS and more. That's how good the ceviche' was.\n2) However, there were issues with one of the lunches served to another person in my party and the person was  quite upset with not only the issues, but the response of management. I'm confident they would have given the restaurant 1 or 2 stars, if any, based on their personal experience. This is why:\nThe burger was supposed to be served with salad or fries; it came with fries and the person ordered salad; the same person's lunch was delayed and the other two in the party were reluctant to begin eating. didn't come at the same time as mine or the other person dining with us. When the burger did come, and the missing egg  was brought to the servers attention, he did his best to correct it but when the egg did finally come, it was runny, not hard. Then, the salad which was also delayed, had a piece of cardboard in it, about an inch wide and half long. When it was brought to the attention of the server, he apologized of course and appeared to mortified. He went to discuss with the manager who then took $3 off the bill, but never came over himself to apologize; and I believe he should have. It could have diffused this whole thing. A round of drinks was also offered by the server as a measure of goodwill. The two in our party were not satisfied with this offer and and said something else to the server as we left. He again went to speak with the manager and we waited and waited for the outcome. Tired of waiting for a response, we left. The server finally got an answer from management  then followed us out of the restaurant and down the street to again apologize to tell us the manager was going to provide a gift card. That was fine, but it was all very awkward and should have been handled a little better by the manager. The poor server was obviously embarrassed and certainly wanted to make it better, but was not in authority to do so. \nWould I go back there: YES; my meal was fine and the food I ordered was delicious, as was the food the other members in my party ordered, except for the fries that were sent instead of the salad and the runny egg that eventually came and the salad with the cardboard in it.  Would my friends go back there? That is highly unlikely. Lucky for the restaurant, those friends were visiting from out-of-state and I just happen to live here. I would absolutely return to this restaurant for the food.  No system is infallible and *%^& happens and the cardboard , especially, was unfortunate.

It's also pleasantly busy but not full, so getting seated is a cinch, even on Friday/Saturday nights at dinner time.\n\nThe pisco sours are pretty good.

The service on this night was a bit slow but the cocktails came quickly after we ordered. All is forgiven.  This was another favorite of my friend whom I was visiting in SF. He was sure I would like this place considering the last few restaurants was a bust.\n\nWe had to try the Ceviche Mixto and Anticuchos but they were out of the second. The server said, 'They weren't expecting as many customers?' How many customers order beef heart skewers and were they expecting everyone to be away for the Holiday weekend? So we opted for the scallops. Let's say the Anticuchos weren't missed. The Ceviche was delicious with a mix of white corn to give crunchiness/texture and tartness was balanced. The scallops were perfectly seared as Gordon Ramsay would say and the accompanying sauce was a hit. \n\nThe mains are another story. The portions where huge. This must be the Nouveau part of the menu or is the modern take on Peruvian dishes?  One entr\u00e9e could really be shared for two people unless one is extremely hungry. All the dishes where well flavored and we just kept wanting to eat more until our stomach cried out no more! Okay, just one more bite! The lamb shank was tender in a deep rich sauce, the rice tender but not mushy. My friend's Churrasco was cooked to the way he ordered. The sunny side egg on top was a treat as was the tomato chimichurri.  This was a meat eater's nirvana.\n\nI can see why this local eatery is so popular. It has good vibes, plentiful food done right and nice cocktails are all a good ingredients for a win by all.

After a few short stops along the way (there is plenty to see and do) we arrived at our dining destination, Fresca, a Peruvian restaurant with an amazing menu.\n\nWe split a trio sampler of their ceviche (you can actually choose between seven different options) We ordered the Ceviche Mixto with white fish, calamari, shrimp, and scallops; Ceviche Chifa with tuna; and Ceviche de Coco another tuna dish with coconut-jalapeno milk, cashews and jicama.  The ceviche trio came with  a small plate of house toasted corn nuts, and a basket of fried plantains. This could have been a meal in itself. Each of the dishes was fresh and bursting with an assortment of flavors and vegetables from sweet potatoes with cilantro and corn to a pondu-leche sauce with crispy wontons and avocados. \n\nFor dinner, I decided to go on the lighter side. I ordered the El Toro Steak Salad. First of all, their salads are huge. Enough that two people could easily split. The steak was melt in your mouth tender and juice. It sat on a bed of mixed greens with tomatoes, avocados and onions. All topped with a creamy cilantro dressing. This little doggy had her tail wagging the entire evening.  \n\nFresca's food is amazing. It's inventive, fresh and, exploding with flavor.  Alas, sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. The bad part of the evening came from our waiter who just couldn't keep it together. Twice we asked for sparkling water, we never did get it. When we first got seated we ordered a couple of glasses of wine, we waited and waited. I happened to look over, our wine was sitting on the bar waiting to be served. Our waiter was off in the corner of the restaurant laughing and carrying on a conversation oblivious to why he was actually there...to serve his customers.\n\nIf I were rating this restaurant on their food alone, I would gladly give it 5 paws, but I am a bit picky when I go out to a restaurant, I want to be treated like they want me there. And no it wasn't due to a shortage of staff or a busy evening.  We ate early, about 6:0pm.

If that wasn't bad enough, I watched her touch the bottle to every single person's glass. That means that everyone's germs are intermingled because she can't pour without it touching.

Can have unlimited mimosas for brunch for $12 when you order any entree.  Not bad deal except the fact that I'll be annoyingly intoxicated by the second glass..(not worth it for me).\n\nWhat I liked: \n*Ceviche.  the andean corn are like crunchy/crisp kernels that add texture to the dish.  Nice hit of lime to go with the seafood.  \n*Lechon asado- pulled pork sandwich, mango-aji glaze, pickled onion, gouda cheese, soft roll. Pulled pork in the sandwich had wonderful flavor and went well with pickled onion.  Dutch crunch roll didn't complement the pork.  Bread was so thick that I solely tasted the bread.  Much better eaten with bottom half of bread only or with different type of bread in general.  I'd actually prefer rice or something.\n\nNot so much: \n*Pollo a la Brasa- sounded so good on the menu.  Instead, I received dry chicken (white meat portion especially) which means it was definitely NOT slow roasted, where if it was, it would fall of the bone.  Cilantro vinaigrette that came as a sauce for chicken and as a dressing for salad lacked flavor.  Where was the citrus/vinegar base or the cilantro?  Average fries which tasted like fresh potatoes.  \n\nI'd come back for the ceviche for sure.  And possibly try appetizers.   Dishes I've had could have been executed a lot better especially due to their high rating (Zagat recommended I think).", "author": "Kimberly C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-08", "description": "Arrived with a group of 4 with an 8pm reservation on a Friday night and was greeted by a huge crowd of about 15 people crammed into the entryway - couldn't even get to the hostess stand. After sliding between people to say hello to the sweet but slightly overwhelmed hostess, I decided to take my leave of this area and wait just outside the restaurant at their outside tables that seem to be made for this. I expected the inside crowd to dissipate, but low and behold, it actually stayed like that for the good part of an hour...as did we outside. That's right: 8pm reservation, seated at 9pm. I was in good company of friends, so it was horrible but definitely not a good start.  The hostess ended up bring us all a glass of house sangria as an apology, which helped, but an hour off your reservation schedule is pretty excessive.\n\n\"OK\", I thought when we were being seated, \"Now it's time to eat some good Peruvian food and with my friends! This is what I waited for! Fresh seafood! Ceviche! Choclo! Lomo saltado!...\". But alas, I was thwarted at every turn (gnashing and grinding of teeth)...\n\nFirst - table assignment: \"The only table we have right now (after the hour wait) is a large table -- do you guys mind sitting with another party of 3 at the same table? If not, it'll be a bit for another table of 4 to open..\"  No prob. I'm social - sure. Communal table it is, though wasn't expecting this when I was planning on catching up with friends I hadn't seen in a while...but certainly not planning on waiting any longer for my meal, so yeah, I'll take it. No biggie.\n\nSecond - noise: We were seated right next to the open kitchen. So loud. SO LOUD. Clanging of pots, dropping of pans, and kitchen staff literally yelling to other cooks and staff at the ceviche station which was in the middle of the restaurant, who were yelling back to them. Some would call it lively I guess - perhaps dynamic.....I would call it: I can't hear my waitress and am having trouble holding a decent convo with my friends at my table who are right next to me!! Yeah, it kinda sucked.  But ok, fine, I'm hungry...bring on the food!\n\nThird - food: We ordered 2 ceviches. Only 1 showed up at the table. Why? Who knows -- it was probably too loud and the waitress didn't hear the order. Didn't show up on the check later either, thankfully.\n        Ceviche: was good, but not great. Not horrible, just bland. The accoutrements were good -- yummy yam and choclo, but the actual fish..meh is all.\n        Whole fried dorade with seafood sauce and rice: I am a sucker for whole fish. I was going to go with the lomo saltado, but whole fish presentation was gorgeous, and totally won out, especially after the waitress recommendation. Once again, unfortunately, the taste did not match the expectation. The fish was good I guess, but that was about it --- I'm sure it was fresh, but was a quite bit more fishy than I expected for Dorade, and slightly more chewy than I expected as well. The worst part was the fact that the fish had so many tiny bones in it that were in addition to the regular spine, that every tiny bite held the treasure of 2-3 small bones that you would have to sift through in your mouth to avoid getting stuck in the throat. After about half the fish, I was done with it. Just too much - I've had whole fish many times before, but I had it with this one.  Then the sauce -- tomato based sauce with clams/mussels/calamari.... waaay too acidic. Not only that, but honestly, the seafood did not taste fresh at all...in fact it all tasted a bit off. Most of the shells were only very slightly opened, which should have been my tip off to not eat the little guys, but how could you resist -- yeah, lesson learned.  It's rough when you get a dish of whole fried Dorade in a mussel/clam/calamari seafood sauce with rice, and the best part is the rice. Oof.\n\nMy friend's dishes were not so great either apparently -- on friend had a ahi tuna dish which she said was passable at best, but not order it again -- nothing memorable. My other friend had the arroz con camarones with cilantro rice...apparently it was more like cilantro, with some cilantro, and then with a little added cilantro and a few rice grains. More oof.\n\nThe waitress then came back to ask about desert -- I think not. \n\nI was full, but it was way later then I had anticipated finishing dinner, and I was not satisfied. In fact, I was disappointed. The only thing that kept it from being a total failure was sharing it with my friends -- thank you guys.\n\nLow 2 star rating to you Fresca (I reserve 1 star ratings for food poisoning, visualized rodents, quarrels with staff/management, etc.....so didn't quite reach that level). In a city with so many other options for dining, and even for Peruvian dining, I do not plan to be back, unless you do something to significantly improve yourself.

That was red flag #1...how is a Peruvian restaurant run out of what should be a staple for them?! So weird and it left me with a really bad feeling--that, in hindsight should have been our signal to leave--because it didn't get any better thereafter!\nThe waitress (short bob--brown hair) took our orders and disappeared for what seemed like FOR.

So, finally my son's order came--and he wanted Ketchup.  I asked our waitress (brown,short hair) for ketchup and she said \"sure\" and disappears never to return with it...we ask the guy working reception--he says \"of course\" and it still never comes...finally, we ask another waitress and we finally get our ketchup! \nI'm hoping at this point, that the food will come in, take center stage and save the day....wrong! The salmon benedict I ordered...was disappointing! There was an egg shell in it...and I was hoping with the \"poached\" egg to break in to it and get all that creamy goodness and was sad to see it was actually soft boiled...no creamy goodness for me!! My friend's ceviche was way too spicy for her--and mind you, she's a Peruvian that loves spicy food...She had them take it back and when they brought it back--she said it was too salty.  \nAfter we were done eating--again, we had to wait forever for our check that was over $200.

Both were very tasty. but if I remember correctly, a bit pricey. I had the Pisco Sour as well, which was definitely strong (or I'm just weak). The chef was also walking around handing out jello shots which really lightened the mood! The dessert definitely stood out to me-- we ordered I think 4 different desserts and my favorite was the picarones - peruvian style beignets. \n\nI definitely want to return to re-experience this place with different company so things can be a bit more laid-back while eating. Items were a bit on the pricier end, but overall, I think anyone could have a pleasant dinner experience here. There are also a lot of small/cute shops to walk around in the area. Street parking is a bit hard, but manageable. I'll pay closer attention to the prices when I'm ordering next time though :P", "author": "Ghia G."}

Well yesterday we stopped into the Church location on a whim and my goodness was it BAD. I won't be returning to either location as service was just horrendous.\n\nWhen we walked into the Church location yesterday, the hostess escorted us to the bar instead of offering a table. At which point we had to guess and ask whether it was happy hour, which the bartender confirmed, yes we could order from the happy hour menu. We were okay with that, if not feeling a bit sidelined. My beau ordered a beer, I ordered a Pisco sour. The bartender let my bf know that they can't count the beer he ordered on happy hour but they COULD offer negro modelo. BF said fine, but then we looked down to see the happy hour menu said clearly that ALL beers are $3. Oh well, he was flexible either way, it was just a misleading menu. We ordered the crab cakes and plantain chips to start, the bartender confirmed all of our items. \n\nTwenty five minutes later my bf had received his beer, but I never got my pisco sour. The food wasn't coming out. The bartender was scurrying around  fixing bloody mary's for his friends seated at the end of the six person bar. It took several minutes to get his attention even though it was only a 6 person bar and we were seated in the CENTER, and it was not big enough to slip into obscurity as he did. We asked if I might be able to get my pisco sour? He looked blankly at us. Then it was as if a light bulb went off and he blurted, \"Oh, you know what? We don't have crab cakes to serve you today\".\n\nHuh. When was he going to tell us that? We already had to interrupt him from his socializing just to ask where my drink was that he never made us. When did he learn that what we actually ordered to eat was not available? Twenty five minutes ago?\n\nWith that we closed our tab on the one beer and walked out. We went around the corner to a quaint Japanese restaurant, which I'm happy to say, was a much a more pleasant experience.\n\nNever again, Fresca. Never again!", "author": "Steenie K."}

We had all had the obligatory dinners with our friends and or family, so we decided to try and find a spot for dessert. After calling around, most places were understandable closed for the day. Even the hotels we called were closing too early for us to make it there.\n\nThen I remembered hearing that Fresca would be open, so we headed over to Noe Valley and had the easiest time parking ever. When we arrived the tables were all crowded with jolly looking revelers and were offered seats at the bar. So we climbed up on the stools and asked for dessert menus. The selection was interesting with a few good old standbys like tres leches cake and some interesting things like some kind of Frescafied beignets. And that hideous treacly chocolate lava cake that seems to be on everyone's menu.\n\nWe went with the tres leches cake and the beignets. Now, the night was pleasant enough, everyone was feeling the holiday spirit and in pretty good moods. Even me. Otherwise the fact that the waitstaff elbowed me every time they walked by my chair would have bothered me. Now don't get me wrong, there wasn't any MMA action, it was more like a nudge, but it happened maybe twelve or thirteen times. It's unfortunately due to the arrangement of the bar area and entirely unintentional. I sat as close to the bar as humanly possible, but there just is no way to get out of the way in that particular corner.\n\nI told myself it was part of the charm of being in one of the only restaurants open on Christmas day. I hoped that when our desserts arrived, all would be well. But that was a disappointment as well. Most of the beignets were burned. I didn't have more than a bite, and my friend hung on for a bit more, but was at least as unimpressed as I was.\n\nAs for the tres leches, the flavor was excellent and exactly what you would expect from a tres leches cake. I am sometimes adventurous and sometimes I want a traditional recipe. Maybe it was Christmas, but tonight I was feeling traditional. It is a lightly vanilla flavored cake soaked in a mixture of milks and cream. My only complaint is that I think tres leches cake should be moist and spongy, but this was rather wet and mushy in the middle.", "author": "Joshua R."}

Service is middling. \n\nFood: we ordered a bit of everything: ceviche, all different kinds of traditional Peruvian food, the steak strips, mahi mahi, the vegetarian dish, a chicken dish. It was all good. All the flavors are balanced nicely. And they are all rich, borderline heavy foods. The rice is good and the risotto is excellent. Love the bed of fries underneath dishes, Peruvian style. Glasses of wine are large and tasty.\n\nWhat's a bit lacking here is the service. Granted, we got a guy who was new, and thus he could tell us little about the food. One of the ceviches looked like it was missing fish (it was sliced thinly underneath other toppings), and when we asked about it, he said it was underneath, and then came back twice to explain that's why he doesn't usually recommend it (which he didn't beforehand, although we didn't ask) and that it was an extra fancy Japanese fish and that's why there was so little of it.\n\nAlso, my water glass was left unfilled at two different extended times during the meal. Once I had to ask to get it filled. I shouldn't have to do that.\n\nOne thing I will say of the service is that everyone was incredibly gentle and nice. That goes a long way, but it wasn't quite enough to make up for the other things.\n\nThe only food that wasn't awesome was the free appetizer bread. It wasn't served warm and there wasn't enough butter to go around our party of 5.\n\nI think once this place tightens up the service just a stitch, the food makes it easily a 4 star place. Right now, it felt like you were paying a little too much for middling service.\n\nAlso, what is nice about this place are the Yelp deals for a free glass of wine with an entree.

I wasn't happy about how it was seasoned.

However, anytime I bring my out of town guests to SF, all of them rate Fresca as their favorite meal in SF. The reason being is no matter what you order on the menu, you'll love it. \n\nI'm not a fan of seafood, however I'll eat the ceviche. Their sampler which includes 3 or 4 different type of ceviche have unique sauces and veggies with it. As for the main dishes, all of them are perfected. I typically order the lomo saltado which is a safe dish in any peruvian restaurant, however the seared atun with purple potatoes, pallela, and salmon with squid ink dishes were all phenomenal. Their portions are generous (I always go home with leftovers!) and they know how to cook their meat/dish well. Everything we ordered was so moist. \n\nAmbiance is nice, sangria is light and delightful, I'd highly reccomend this palce.", "author": "Grace K."}

BUT he walked by our table and served a large plate of it to the table next to us! \n\n:O I know! It's criminal! We asked the waiter what the plate was called that he just served them and he was like \"...Jalea................\" THEN he let us order a Jalea. Apparently they called ahead of time??

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-24", "description": "Fresca is a local chain, which any where else would not necessarily be a deterrent. I care more about the LOCAL, and less about the CHAIN; Applebee's this restaurant surely is not, despite technically being a \"chain.\" With that being said, there are so many overwhelming options in SF and when you are doing a mental Franklin list of pros and cons for a place in your head, it's being a chain - even a local chain - will usually go into the con list.\n\nBut why? Shouldn't it make sense that if a place is really good it will be really popular and lead a restauranteur to try and replicate the experience so more people can get in on the deliciousness and spend more money? Is being a small, local chain really a bad thing, or does it mean a place actually knows what they are doing? With Fresca, after 2 meals at 2 locations (the Noe Valley and Fillmore restaurants) I can say there is a good reason for multiple versions of this Peruvian dining experience to exist: it is just plain ole good, fresh food.\n\nThe ceviche was what stood out on my first trip. I popped into the restaurant on a sunny July day during the madness of the Fillmore Jazz Festival. Summer and ceviche go together like fall and soup, so the light, fresh raw fish, mango, pineapple, onion, tomato all jibed well with a nice summer day. The ceviche was fresh and delicious the first time (we got the sampler), though on the second time it was so acidic it actually burnt my throat. \n\nSo, a 50% success rate on the ceviche (which is kind of spendy, as is all their food), and still 4 stars? Why? Two words: PORK CHOP!\n\nOK, this is one of the best things I have had in the city hands down! They pan fry and bake the chop, giving it a buttery tenderness that truly melts in your mouth.\n\nYes, the Noe Valley location gets crowded (which led to our server doing the bare minimum...which was actually enough), and parking is a bitch (luckily I can walk there), but that pork chop served atop a bed of sticky cilantro lime rice will make it all better!\n\nAs far as ambience, it is a laid back, neighborhood feel - like a lot of Noe Valley married couples might go there for date night while the kids are with a sitter. Feels very lively and fun though, with lots of bright colored paintings and walls to match the bright tastes of the food.", "author": "Serena Q."}

My second time there was outstanding as well!\n\nCeviche was very tasty. Add some banana chips, that's what we're talking about. The head chef (or owner) then brought out some \"happy\" gello and we had some (liquor enhanced, of course). He swung by again as he had some extra and gave us both another one! Good stuff.\n\nMain courses came out and my fiancee had the chicken stew and I had the pork chop. The way they prepared it was exquisite. The stew was great and the pork chop was probably the best tasting chop I've ever had in my life. Portions were great also as it was enough for a guy like me and enough for her to have leftovers of the stew. \n\nThe server was great and explained the dishes. A very friendly environment. The first time we were there, there was no wait and the restaraunt was half full (raining that night). The second time there, also on a Wednesday, it was packed and we had to wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-14", "description": "The evening before Easter, my cousins and I had the last minute idea of looking for a place where we could eat a big, yummy brunch, preferably buffet-style but otherwise just really, really good. Of course just a few minutes browsing Opentable informed me that #1, this should have been something we planned at least a couple weeks prior in order to actually get a reservation, and #2, Easter buffets/brunches are UN-necessarily exorbitant and not worth the money anyway.\n\nSooooo my next thought was to type \"bottomless mimosas\" into the search field of Yelp and see what turned up.\n\nAny yelper versed in the unlimited decantation of this bubbly-slash-OJ morning mixture would probably be able to correctly guess what the first couple matches to come up were. But Chef Eric Hopfinger's establishment was unsurprisingly booked, and nor did I particularly want to spend the most important day of the Christian calendar under a disco ball listening to Lady Gaga's new single in which she croons \"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\" on blast (I'm not even religious, but still). One might be surprised, however, to learn that the fourth match or so is actually a well-respected city restaurant known more for its evening servings of ceviche and lomo saltado. Fresca in Noe Valley was wide open for a noon reservation that day, so I booked us a spot and excitedly awaited Easter morn.\n\nFirst off, I like this location way more than the Fillmore location--it's much larger, much less cramped, and brighter. Second off, the Fillmore location apparently does not feature the same limitless deal on mimosas that Noe Valley does. Strike three in favor of Noe Valley Fresca is their plasma TV screen that was playing the Giants vs. Padres game. As does Tim Lincecum (who was pitching that day) strike out many a batter, so does Noe Valley win against the more popular location.\n\nThe food and service were outstanding. We couldn't have asked for more. During the day they serve these scrumptious cornmeal strawberry muffins to start--so simple, yet so good. Everything on the brunch menu (which includes standard fare with a Peruvian twist) sounded delicious, so with some difficulty we decided on the cangrejo omelette with crab, avocado, and cream cheese, the belgian waffle with mascarpone and fruit, and the Peruvian frittata topped with steak. Oh. My. God. The food was SO GOOD! And so reasonably priced! While I've enjoyed dinner at Fresca, brunch here is just as tasty but better yet does not break the bank. Especially when $12 gets you as many mimosas as you could possibly want--at some point we seriously had to cover our glasses with our hands to keep the waiter from graciously pouring another.\n\nIn sum, amazing. Thank you Yelp, for letting me in on this wonderful secret. And thank you Fresca! With your decadent brunches and free-flowing drinks, every Sunday is Easter Sunday.", "author": "Kate V."}

I called the bartender out on false advertising - no where does it say you need to be sitting at the actual bar (we were in the bar area) - and he finally agreed to honor happy hour prices.

Menu items are all ample and outstandingly prepared with fresh, local ingredients.  The best parts about the Noe Valley restaurant are the expansive area and high ceilings and the fact that they have a full bar with GREAT bartenders.\n\nThe only trouble with the Noe Valley location is that they are short, traditionally, about 1-2 waiters which make service very slow and somewhat irritating.

I give them benefit of the doubt and believe that the miscommunication was a one time ordeal that will not be repeated in the future, so 4 stars it is!\n\nI went with a medium-sized party and when we got there, they told us they didn't have our reservation. What? we made it weeks in advance via Opentable. So after showing them our printed confirmation, they apologized profusely and told us they'd get us seated asap, nonetheless we still waited for 30+ min past our original reservation time\n\nThe ceviches were very tasty, more so than some of the other tapas bars in SF like Chachacha & Limon. There is also a great selection of ceviches - we ordered 3 different kinds that night (spicy shrimp, scallop, and good ol fish + calamari) I also recommend the sangria, it's very flavorful and sweet, and they are definitely not stingy on the fruits they put in the drinks! As for main entrees, I ordered the steak, which was decent, the paella & pork shoulder were delish (had a taste of my friends' food)\n\nThey are very generous with portions, whether it's appetizers or main entrees. They also have an \"open kitchen\" where you can basically see the chefs work their magic. The waiters don't really chit-chat with you but that's understandable since they seem at bit short-staffed and the line is out the door. A by-product of that is slow service....we waited for about 45 min to get our food.

I was counting on them to help me cater a party, which is starting in less than four hours, and they completely failed me -- and didn't even apologize. It was the rudest, least friendly interaction I've ever had with a restaurant.\n\nI confirmed an order within my budget 24 hours prior. I was told to call back at 10:30 this morning to make sure everything was in order. I called at 10:30...then at 11:30...then at 12:30...and every time I was told the manager was \"literally just pulling up to the store\" and would call \"immediately.\" Finally, at 1:30 PM, I get a call from the manager, who was one of the rudest people I've ever spoken to. First, I asked her to confirm what time the order would be ready for pick up. She said, in a really condescending tone, \"How am I supposed to know? What time do you want to pick it up, lady?\" Then, I asked her to clarify what one of the items on the menu was. She got really annoyed that I asked and would only say, \"I mean, how am I even supposed to explain it to you?\" Then I started going over the total cost, and that's where everything totally broke down. She proceeded to tell me that the order I'd placed could in fact only feed half the number of people I'm expecting to host, and then she started berating me for expecting her to \"give away my food for free\" and asked me, \"Don't you understand you can't feed that many people for so little money?\" As if I'm supposed to know! I was obviously really upset, and tried explaining to her that I was expected to feed all these people in mere hours, and that yesterday everything had been fine. She had zero sympathy, didn't apologize once, and began raising her voice at me over the phone. Eventually, she straight up hung up on me. \n\nIt's one thing to mix up an order, it's another to be completely unapologetic and rude about it, and expect customers to do your job for you.

Despite the fact we sat near a table full of shrieking ladies (one of them kept cackling like a banshee.  Hubby asked if I wanted to move tables but based on her volume no matter where we sat we would hear it so I said no), the place and ambiance is pleasant enough.\n\nOverall impression: the flavors were good but there were certain things that were lacking that most likely will prevent us from coming back.  Service is a bit slow- my hubby asked for wine for our main course and it still hadn't arrived by the time we finished. However I thought the sangria was pretty good.  \n\nFor appetizers we had the Ceviche Mixto and Teradito.  The Ceviche Mixto was very light on seafood.  I think my hubby only had a couple of shrimp and scallops, 1 clam and 1 mussel.  I don't think I actually tasted the calamari.  He was very disappointed at such a tiny presentation.  The fish in the teradito was nicely firm and fresh and actually had a good quantity of them but after a while the acidity starting overpowering the dish.\n\nWe then had the papa rellena and some dish with avocados and seafood that I don't remember the name of and has since been removed from the menu.  The papa rellena (beef potato croquettes) was pretty good but they only serve you 2 small pieces.  The avocado dish is where we both had a problem- it hardly contained any seafood!  It was basically a mound of avocado slices and a few measly pieces of scallops?, calamari?, fish? we really couldn't tell because they were that tiny and non existent. \n\nWe split a seafood paella and while the flavors were good, it was a little too wet.  Again, they only provided 3 mussels, 2 clams and maybe around 4 shrimp.  C'mon- don't label it seafood if you don't provide the main ingredients!\n\nBased on all that we had we decided to skip dessert.", "author": "Jane N."}

I thought this was the bar.. lol\n\nSo I was served my Sangria after 5-10 minutes and I said \"Can I go ahead and pay now?\" and guy #2 said \"Um, yeeah.. suure..\" and started to confer with guy #1.

Really, I'm not trying to be a hater.\n\nI made a reservation on Open Table (it was my first time using Open Table) and it was quite easy to use! And my friends and I showed up at the restaurant right on time, 12:00 noon. I was impressed with our timing. We arrive and the hostess sits us. We're missing one more person, so they bring us the menu to look at. Ten minutes later our friend arrives. Still, no waiter. Another 10 minutes go by, so it's like 12:20 pm by now.. no waiter, no water, no \"let's get something started for you to drink?\"\n\nAnyway, finally, we order our bottomless mimosas and our entrees. I was disappointed with the mimosas, to be honest. They bring you a Champagne flute of mimosas, which isn't a lot... and it was $12. We had many bottom-full mimosas (or empty mimosa flutes sitting around and they didn't refill it right away, which defeats the purpose of \"bottomless mimosas\"). At one point, we had to ask them to fill up our drinks. Speaking of drinks, we had to ask for glasses of water like at least twice. I can understand that one might forget if it's busy around the restaurant, but it wasn't, so I'm not sure what happened there. \n\nIn terms of the food, I ordered the cangrejo omelet (I believe it was $13), which had fresh Dungeness crab, avocado, cream cheese, chives, aji panca hollandaise (I copied and pasted this from their online menu). Now, this dish was delicious (which is why I'm giving this place a 2).. The crab tasted fresh and it was slightly salted... add some avocado to that. Yum. So, it comes with a wide of either sweet potato fries or fresh fruit. I asked for fruit, but I got sweet potato fries instead... so I asked for fruit again... and got a bowl of fruit on the side. Anyway, seems like they need to be reminded of what their customers want to order.. \n\nSo, yeah.. I don't think I'll be coming back here for my Sunday mimosa adventures.", "author": "Cassy H."}

We definitely made it a night to remember (or forget as it may be; read on).  We started with a pitcher of creamy, delicious pisco sours and a ceviche sampler that featured all hits, no misses.  After the pitcher was over, we ordered a couple glasses of wine with our entrees which, if memory serves, were on par with the appetizers.

I almost feel as accomplished as a Pokemon master capturing his last desired Pokemon! :) \n\nI digress.\n\nI've had slightly better experiences at the other locations for some reason. I must note though that the Noe Valley location looks to be the largest of the three and it even includes a bar seating area. I still recommend the Fillmore location as the best spot for the most intimate setting and the best service.\n\nFor those eating at Fresca for the first time, Fresca is considered a Peruvian fusion restaurant and the dishes presented are bold on flavors and taste delicious.\n\nOur group started with ordering various ceviches for our appetizer. I like how Fresca offers the ability for you to sample 3, 4, or 6 styles of ceviches. To save our stomachs for the main courses we thought 4 was a good number to go with.\n\nI highly recommend getting the Plantain chips ($5) to eat with the ceviches too. The chips are generally thin, crispy, golden fried, and sprinkled with garlic sea salt. Pile the fish on top of the plantain chips and bite down to experience a change in texture from the soft fish to the crunchy chips. It's going to be a fun party in your mouth!! Sadly, the plantain chips we ordered at the Noe Valley location tasted a little stale. They could have been sitting out for a while.\n\nTrio - Tasting of three ceviches ($16)\nCuatro - Tasting of four ceviches ($20)\nSeis - Tasting of six ceviches ($26)\n\nOur group sampled the following four:\n\nCeviche Chino - Ahi tuna tartare, guacamole, ponzu sauce, lettuce cups, aji verde, wonton chips\n\nCeviche de Coco - White tuna, lime-coconut water, mango, aji limo, ginger, onion, red peppers, basil, plantain chips\n\nBlack Ceviche - Calamari, shrimp, scallops, clam, cilantro, squid ink rocoto sauce, red onion, lime juice, sea salt.\n\nHamachi Tiradito - Peruvian style sashimi, jalape\u00f1o, soy, white truffle oil, andean corn.\n\nMy favorites this time were the Ceviche de Coco and the Black Ceviche. The Ceviche de Coco had a light and refreshing coconut taste that wasn't overpowering. The Black Ceviche didn't taste as what I imagined. I thought the squid ink would be overwhelming, but in actuality I couldn't taste it at all. I mainly tasted the lime/citrus flavors as I was eating the big mix of seafood from scallops to shrimp to calamari.\n\nFor my main course I ordered the Aji de Dallina ($16) that was comprised of pulled chicken stew, aji amarillo cream, yukon potatoes, soft-boiled eggs, walnuts, and steamed rice.\n\nI can see myself eating the Aji de Dallina indoors on a cold day. It's great comfort food and the creamy texture of the stew blended really well with all the ingredients. The pulled chicken pieces were very tender and the walnuts added extra texture to the dish.\n\nThe food was amazing at Fresca, but my major complaint was the slow service. We had reservations for our group of 8, but it took the servers nearly 20 minutes to seat us at our table. Once we ordered our food it also took a while to arrive at our table.\n\nDespite this fact, the food still won my taste buds over.\n\n== A MUST TRY! ==", "author": "Jason H."}

The place was almost empty, which doesn't mean the bus boy can take his time cleaning up.  We were there for almost 30 minutes before it was cleared.  Additionally, the person that was supposed to clock in before 4 and be our server was late so our original server was switched out mid-meal.  And apparently since our new server was late and behind on restocking the bar for nighttime service it took him forever to check on us, get us a bill, etc.  This is already an annoying experience, and then we have the food...\n\nI can't have ceviche, but my lady had it and was unimpressed.  She used to make ceviche in a fine dining restaurant so she knows what she's talking about.  She tried a sampler of three and couldn't finish any of them.  We also ordered the scallops, which we both enjoyed very much.  I would probably order them again.  I loved the plantain chips, and the sauce was nice.  For dinner, she ordered a steak and I ordered a pork chop.  Both of our dishes needed some serious salt and pepper.  Her steak was fine, but nothing special.  My pork chop was also just OK.  It comes with sweet potato mash, some sweet apples, and spinach.  The spinach is not enough to balance out all of that sweetness.  It was just too much, and the pork chop didn't taste like anything by itself.\n\nOverall, we probably won't be back here.

I have tried all three locations several times, and I'm tempted to say Noe Valley is the coolest to go to, but I really love the servers at West Portal the most.\n\nI don't know why I waited so long to bring my Peruvian friend, Sandra, here.  She asked the waiter to bring their aji verde, a green chili sauce.\nI may be so bold as to say it is equally delicious as my first love, Sriracha.\n\nI put the aji on the bread, the fries from the highly recommended lomo saltado, and I even went as far as to pour it onto my espinacas y cangrejo.  It's probably frowned upon, but I really don't care!\n\nYou can choose combinations of any of their ceviches.  I've done this two times now, and my three top choices are: (in this order)\n\nceviche de coco - white tuna, lime-coconut water, mango, aji limo, ginger, onion, red peppers, basil, plantain chips.\n\nceviche mojito - halibut, mint, onion, rum, rocoto, lime juice, sea salt, choclo, cancha morada.\n\nceviche mixto - calamari, shrimp, scallops, clam, cilantro, onion, rocoto pepper, lime juice, sea salt.\n\nTry it, you'll like it.

Well all my excitement disappeared when I got my food.  I ordered the tuna salad, something easy, hard to mess up.   Well, at least I thought that.  But they messed it up, and messed it up good.  The salad was disgusting. I mean really unedible.  Living in San Francisco I am accustomed to really good quality fish, cooked and prepared propely.  The tuna on the sald here was inedible. I mean I literally could not eat it.  It was cut into these really thick rectangles and not properly seared.  I can't even properly describe how bad the tuna was, I wish I could have taken a picture.

Here, you get a little tiny bowl of some strange marinade over some odd fish cocktail.

This particular place is good at accommodating large groups.  We came with I think 12 people\n\nTheir ceviche is soooo tasty!  thinking about it makes my mouth water.  I love the ceviche and how the fish gets slightly cooked in the acidic juices.  It doesn't come with much, and costs a lot.  I don't recommend getting the sampler ceviche because they split those up into a dish that has 4 small squares... so I think you end up getting less.  The ceviche has great flavor and has corn kernels in it, which I love.  \n\nThe entrees are also very good!!!  I've tried a bunch of things:\n- Paella - arroz con mariscos - aji panca spiced rice, calamari, clams, mussels, prawns, fish, scallops, cilantro, chicha de jora fume.-----was kind of fishy tasting, wouldn't recommend it\n- ahi mignon - rose pepper crusted ahi tuna, purple potato puree, pickled mango, aji huacatay, soy-ginger emulsion.  **very tasty! esp the purple potato puree!\n-churrasco - grilled filet mignon ,roasted purple potatoes ,asparagus, shitake mushroom demi -glaze ,huancaina.** I thought the steak was pretty good, and flavorful\n- cordero - pistachio crusted new zealand rack of lamb, mint mojo, quinoa taboul\u00e9, truffle mashed potatoes, demi-glaze.***YUMMMM\n\nHonestly, I dont think you can really go wrong here... they're good at their seafood dishes, and the meat dishes are really flavorful.

Although the West Portal location makes this dish better, for $5 during Happy Hour compared to the normal $9, I'd say that it's a pretty good deal for an almost-perfect version. The sangria is also better in the West Portal location but this Fresca has a larger selection of drinks so if you don't like sangria there's a lot more to choose from.\n\nService is exceptionally better than West Portal. Everyone here is extremely nice, from the server to the chef himself. I thought it was so cute how the chef came around the bar and served everyone complimentary jello shots. I'm not sure if it's a regular thing but they were celebrating a birthday that night, so who know's? All I can say is that the jello shot was delicious (and potent). The chef even pointed out that there is a hook for my purse underneath the bar. How thoughtful is that?

All of the fish is fresh tasting and you know it's been marinating for a while because all of the flavors just mesh together so well!\nFor their seafood entrees I recommend the halibut and paella.  All their dishes come looking amazing and plated beautifully!  Not only that, they taste good too! \nAlso the pulled chicken stew!  .. one of the cheapest items on their menu with the most flavor and will fill you up quick!  \nStill never tried their desserts cause everytime I get there .. i'm way too full of great appetizers/entrees to eat anymore!

Ordered the cuatro ceviches (ceviche 5 elementos, ceviche mixto, ceviche mojito, tiradito) and it was all worth it! Love the extensive selections of ceviche; sharing the four types of ceviche between two was already filling enough. However, being the foodie that we are, we ordered the bistec a lo pobre (filet mignon, aji potato cakes, plantain) and the camarones ch\u00edcama (tiger prawns glazed with lucuma orange). OK, so the filet mignon was the bomb! It is huge enough to share between 2-3 people. The sauce was special, salty with a kick to it, we couldn't stop dipping our bread on the filet mignon sauce! Skip the chicama unless you are a fan of really sweet dishes. The sweetness ruined our palette and it was hard for me to eat another prawn (as much as i love prawns) just because sweet and salty didn't mix that night. \n\nWill probably go here again for the ceviche!", "author": "Anette N."}

For the brief hour I am there, I really do feel relaxed and well fed.\n\nI hop to the bar every saturday like clockwork after hitting the Farmers Market a block away...yeah...i'm in here before noon drinkin...what of it?\n\nFor drinks, it varies....I usually have a bloody maria or one of the many Pesco sours. My lady however is very regimented and usually has the Passion Sunrise..she has proclaimed it \"her\" drink when we go there....so it MUST be good.\n\nThe staff isn't up your ass either which is great...they give me just enough breathing room and yet will chat...even in passing if you reach out to them. They've always been pretty attentive to us as well..i've yet to complain about waiting longer than I feel I should for the drink or dish i want.\n\nAnd speaking of food.\nWell again usually my lady always gets the florentine Benedicts...she swears by it and I gotta say...the bits i've had....TAAAAASTY.\nI float...I like to mix it up and try things i've never had before....so here's a run down from the last few visits.\n\nceviche \"5\" elementos: AMAZING...I get this and the de coco all the time now..the flavors are balanced so well on the fish and  lime juice its like candy.\n\nceviche mixto: The Mixto is a great ceviche to break into if trying something new. its milder than the other oddly enough and reminds me of the traditional style with just more fish.\n\nblack ceviche: Using black squid ink as the base this has a bit more of a fishy / oceany taste but is still super fresh fish and tasty. People who can get past the ink will like this. The calamari wasn't chewy at all either. big plus.\n\nceviche de coco: The bartender suggested it to me the first time we came here and i've always gotten it since, again the lime juice and salt mix with the mango to complement every piece of tuna without becoming overbaring...mouthgasm.\n\nOh the Pesco Oyster Shooter are good as well.\n\nI've had all the Oysters in the bar as well and they are always clean and tasty. I've yet to run into a problem.\n\nAll in all the atmosphere is really chill and laid back. it can get a bit noisy and the acoustics amplify everything so if you want something more cozy this may not be your place.

I ordered the lomo saltado and the disappointment continued...at least that was consistent. My fries looked so sad on the plate and they were cold. Overall the dish was too salty.

My experience was a bummer, and even though our friends are constantly telling us how terrible it is, we still went...\nWe came here on a Sunday, towards the end of the brunch time. Before we got seated, we asked the host if they were still doing brunch, because we were specifically looking to eat brunch, and he said yes. \nSo we sat, looked over the menu, and waited... and waited... and then waited. It wasn't even busy, at all! There were probably three other tables, two of which were about to leave. After waiting a little more and making eye-contact with a food runner who kept looking away, we finally got the attention of our waiter. He was speedy, but not a good efficient speedy. A \"hurry the hell up\" type of speedy. We ordered our appetizer and entrees at the same time - we started with the ceviche Chino (ahi), my boyfriend got the Lomo Omelette and I got the Huevos Cazuela and bottomless Mimosas. However, right before we ordered, our waiter said they weren't doing brunch anymore. It was around 2:30pm, the sign outside said brunch ended at 3pm, and our host also confirmed brunch was going. He said he would talk to the cooks, and after he did, brunch was back on. Fantastic...\nThe ceviche was okay... the wonton chips helped with the flavor, but once they ran out... it just went downhill, it was just too vinegary... it just wasn't good.\nThe Lomo Omelette was disappointing to say the least. It lacked the flavor that lomo saltado is supposed to have... it lacked any flavor in general. The potatoes were okay, though... My Huevos Cazuela were yummy though. I'll give them that. Very flavorful and creamy. \nAnother comment about this experience though is that after we finally placed our order, a group of three came by and sat near us. We thought our wait was bad, they literally waited about 20-25 minutes before anyone came to talk to them. I felt bad for them because they were obviously getting annoyed, as any conscious person would. Finally, a waiter who was off the clock, on his lunch, asked them if anyone had taken their order yet, and that he would. Big ups to that dude. \nWe walked away unhappy and also bitter because we paid about $60 for a whatever brunch.

It turns out that a pisco sour has a bunch of brandy in it; either you like brandy or you don't and I don't. I took a couple sips of the drink but I just couldn't get it down so I ordered a bloody mary. The waitress got the hint that I didn't like the drink and refused to charge me for it.

For the 5 years I've frequented my neighborhood ceviche palace on 24th street, I could depend on great atmosphere, tasty vittles, and courteous service.\n\nBut about 6 months after my last visit, I learned last night that not only is the food disappointing, but the atmosphere is also rife with confusion, their checks are riddled with errors, and the staff is inconsistent with information.\n\nI arrived late, so I missed the confusion about which happy hour menu was being offered and where you had to plant your ass to receive a discount - apparently NOT where my friends had already gotten comfy and ordered a round.\n\nI was there in time to make the seemingly unnecessary shuffle from table to bar (in an otherwise empty restaurant) so the happy hour pricing would be honored... we thought.\n\nTurned out after all the fire drills, some lousy appetizers and one round of pisco sours, the bartender presented a receipt that not only stated a price that was lower than the actual total, but the bill also revealed that happy hour wasn't offered on Tuesdays. (WHAT?!?!?) And the bill said I gave $50 cash - which I didn't, because I hadn't yet paid anything.\n\nWhen I had questions about happy hour pricing and the change I got back, the bartender looked at me like I had lobsters growing out of my ears:  not great customer service, especially considering all the other mix ups that occurred in the prior 55 minutes. I guess we actually had misery hour rather than happy hour. :-\\\n\nThat'll be my last visit to Fresca for sure!

While money's nice, what I'd really like a refund on is the amount of time I was forced to spend there, suffering from terrible service and mediocre food.\n\nI had heard good things about Fresca, so when a friend and I found ourselves walking down 24th Street around 7 on a quiet Wednesday night, we decided to check the restaurant out.\n\nIt being Wednesday, the restaurant wasn't particularly busy -- there were people sitting in the back of the restaurant, but the tables in the front and the bar were mostly empty.  We were concerned that we didn't have a reservation, so we asked the hostess if it was still possible for the restaurant to accommodate us.  She told us that she could still seat us and led us to a table facing the bar/kitchen and right by the door.\n\nWhere we sat and waited.  And waited.  And waited.   Thirty minutes later, we were still waiting for our menus all the while madly trying to make eye contact with our server as he passed en route to the kitchen or bar.  After what we considered to be a more than polite wait to be noticed, we asked our hostess if she could please get his attention for us.  He FINALLY deigned to stop by our table, where we asked him if the restaurant was extremely busy that night.  If it was going to be a long wait for dinner, we could return another day.  He assured us that it wasn't a busy night at all and food would be out shortly after we ordered, so we decided to stay.  We asked for water, menus, and bread.  He brought menus.\n\nThen, we waited again.  This time, we waited about 20 minutes before flagging our server down and beseeching him to PLEASE take our order.  Curious as to why our server seemed so unresponsive, I asked if the restaurant was short staffed that particular night.  We were surprised to find that they weren't understaffed.\n\nNo shock to us at this point, but we had to wait for our food too.  We were HUNGRY and tired of sitting at our tables for close to an hour and a half without water, bread or food.  We got up to inform the hostess that we were leaving.  She left briefly, and then returned to tell us our food was on its way.  Within minutes, it was in front of us.\n\nIf it weren't for the terrible service we received at Fresca, I would have never written anything about the food.  However, now that I am writing a review, I'll speak briefly to the food.  At best, it was mediocre and uninspired.  Everything we received (two starters, two entrees) was oversalted and overcooked, which just made our already terrible experience more excruciating.  We didn't even WANT our dinners anymore.  We just wanted to leave.  We took a few bites of everything and passed on dessert (what, and wait another 50 minutes?!?).\n\nOn our way out the door, the hostess asked if we had a good experience.  I asked her if it always took so long to get served.  She responded that if we had reservation, we wouldn't have had to wait so long for service or food.  So we ought to make a reservation.\n\nI was tempted to tell her (but I didn't) that if she didn't think the restaurant could serve us, then she shouldn't have seated us.

I had one bite and nearly spit it out. My woman is much more polite than I so she made a better effort, but also couldn't take more than a few bites. As someone who loves both potatoes and shellfish, this was a tragedy.\n\n- The cesar salad was overdressed and under-seasoned. It completely lacked the briny garlicky anchovy goodness of a house-made cesar. Sad... expensive and sad.\n\n- I was disappointed that the wait staff either didn't notice that we left most of the food on our plates, or didn't care to ask how we found our meal. If so I would have politely accepted the invitation to provide feedback. Instead I said nothing and probably won't go back.

So here it gets even better: We ordered Mussels for an appetizer and a Ceviche dish for my friend. I ordered Lomo Saltado which is my favorite Peruvian dish. About 20 minutes later the ceviche dish comes out. I ask the server and he says he'll go ask the chef about the mussels. In the mean time a table that sat  down after us gets our order of mussels. All the server says is \"sorry it wasn't my fault\" - to sum it all up the whole experience was bad from start to finish. The mussels were decent and my friend liked his ceviche but the beef in the Lomo Saltado was ver tough, I highly doubt that it was beef tenderloin.

It was nice that they were able to accommodate 10 girls without any problems.  But then again, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant today.\n\nThe prices at first looked reasonable: $9-$15 for a dish.  So I ordered a Ceviche Mixto, a dozen oysters on the half shell, and a Crabcake Benedict to share. \n\nThey took a really long time preparing our dishes after we ordered even though there was hardly anyone else there.  But I had my mimosas so I drank and drank.  Then finally, the Ceviche came and I was disappointed to see that it was very small.  Like one handful small.  It tasted good but I can make better.  :D\n\nNext came our dozen oysters, a variety of four different types that I cannot recall the names of.  I didn't like the cocktail sauce but they did provide us some pico-ponzu sauce that was pretty awesome.  The oysters were fresh and satisfying but not mind blowing.  Again, I've had better.\n\nLast but not least were the crabcake benedict that was accompanied by potatoes and fresh fruit.  This dish was a little better.  The crabcake was very tasty and you can tell they used fresh crab meat, not crab meat from a freezer.  And the fresh fruit had mango!  I was just surprised since restaurants normally do that.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get to try their desserts since 1. I was really full and 2. the waiter never bothered to bring around the dessert menu or even ask us if we were interested.  \n\nThe one thing that bothered me most was that everytime I asked our waiter for more mimosa, he'd tell me that the bartender was making it at the moment and that it'd take 5 minutes.  5 minutes would come and go and someone else would ask him to refill their cup as well, not knowing that I had just asked.  The waiter would then respond with the same answer: \"The bartender's making it right now.  We'll get back to you in 5 minutes.\"  It really does not take that long to mix champagne and orange juice, does it?  And considering our whole table ordered the unlimited mimosa special, wouldn't you think of having pitchers ready?  It was a little annoying.  Or I could've just been drunk by that time already.\n\nI paid $50 for my portion, including tip and tax, for unlimited mimosas ($12), half of the ceviche (normally $13), half of the dozen oysters (normally $30), and half of the crabcake benedict (normally $12).

She simply said they are booked right now, not oh it's about 10mins or so etc. Another girl had to come over to the hostess stand and take a look at the screen before they both went and moved 1 of the empty tables around, which there were a few of, and then they promptly sat us without a word. It struck me as kind of awkward but we were happy to have been seated regardless. \n\nThe appetizers came in a timely manner, although the waiter kept informing us of what he was doing. Such as I am going to fire the appetizers 1 by 1 and then he informed us he had fired our entrees. I've been to many different restaurants and these things should just happen. Yes I know you are going to fire my meal after I eat the appetizers, it's common sense. It really didn't matter until it took about 20 mins to get our entrees after the waiter said they'd be out in 10. I wasn't even bother too much about that either. \n\nHERE is the kicker, my mother found a metal piece of wiring, maybe 1 - 1.5 inches long in her salad that came with her meal. She was chewing on it before she realized what it was. It was about 2 mins later when we finally got the waiter's attention. He offered to have the meal remade or just the salad section, which is what my Mom opted for. The waiter wasn't particularly apologetic as I was hoping he would have been, nor did a manager or a chef come over to apologize either. I only mention the chef because throughout the course of this he visited the table next to my Mom 4 or more times, never once paying any attention. Eventually the waiter brought back my Mom's meal with a fresh salad. She was obviously disturbed by the whole thing and decided to eat a little bit of the chicken and just get the rest to take home. I asked for the bill which came quickly to the table, but 10 mins pasted before anyone asked if they could take the check, it wasn't even our own waiter in the end. Finally when the check came back our waiter brought it out to me to sign, everything was on the bill, even the wire filled meal that had to be made twice. I would have expected at the very least a very heartfelt thank you and sorry for what occurred if not comp-ing that particular  meal. \n\nI can honestly say the lack of service was disturbing and the nonexistent manager oversight scary. It's not every night I go out to $100 dinners and when I do I expect to get what I pay for. Even though this place didn't have the class to handle this issue, I still tipped my waiter, a little smaller then normal but a tip none the less. I hope their service improves, because a restaurant is no better then it's reputation.", "author": "Anthony C."}

We ordered two types of ceviche, 5 Elementos and Mixto, Choros al Vapor (mussels in chorizo and sofrito broth), and an order of calamari frito.\n\nCeviche 5 Elementos, a traditional Peruvian dish, was lightly spiced with a perfect lime tang that was complemented by the addition of a sweet roasted yam. Our 2nd dish, Ceviche Mixto, although attractively prepared  and hearty with seafood, was an over-powering jolt of tart lime, chiles and salt that robbed the seafood of flavor. Needless to say, we could not finish this dish.\n\nThe Mussels were plentiful and easily accommodated a shared appetizer for two.  Although the  chorizo and sofrito broth was rich and pungent, it robbed the delicate flavor of the mussels and might  better have been paired with large chunks of white fish or squid to absorb the potency of the chorizo.\n\nThe calamari was  topped with lemon wedges and thin slices of  red onion.  The dish was somewhat bland, with the breading a bit heavy to be considered a \"frito\" for my tastes. (Perhaps this a Peruvian preparation technique.) However, the accompanying aioli with its subtle combination of flavors,  was a welcome addition.\n\nSince it was the end of the brunch shift I will give mild exception to the lack-luster interest and attention of our server.  I will Fresca another chance, but perhaps try another location next time.", "author": "Lady D S."}

Last night I got the pimiento relleno (quinoa vegetable rissoto stuffed bell pepper, manchego cheese, asparagus, aji amarillo cream) and it was seriously OUT OF THIS WORLD. I'm not even a vegetarian! The bell pepper was perfectly grilled and the quinoa was super uber cheesy (but not in a heavy way but a creamy fluid way) and the little pices of asparagus mixed in were the perfect size. The whole thing was also on a bed of perfectly cooked asparagus and that was on top of an amazingly creamy cream (guessing the aji amarillo). Holy shit people. Get it. It's delicious. \n\nAs an appetizer we got teque\u00f1os (fried wontons, shrimp and crab cream cheese, aji amarillo aioli) -- those things are like crack.

Lunch is generally a fast ordeal.In and out in 45min max. \nBoth times I had to ask twice for water and ask for bread. We were seated in the far back corner closest to the highchair stack, because the staff was too lazy to bring one to the front of the restaurant. Also, I had to pull the chair out of the stack myself and place it at the table. On both of these days the establishment maybe had 4 tables ( 8 people) eating. So there was plenty of room in the front for us to sit. The fact that we were somewhat out of view and alone at the opposite end of the restaurant probably had to do with the service. Saying that, the service staff was socializing behind the bar and service station. Having to wave to someone across the room was just not acceptable.  \n\nBut my advice to you:\nWalk the extra steps and bring a highchair to the front. Is it really going to kill you to have to take it back when the customer leaves?!\nIt is pretty insulting being placed alone in the back because you are so obviously lazy. \nMaybe then the service would be more regular. \n\nAside from that, We love the food at Fresca.

About killed myself on day 2, climbing 4000 ft. in 6 hours, but I made it!  Wanted to relive the yummy food we ate, so decided to give Fresca a try.\n\nTrio of ceviche:\n\n-halibut, lime juice, aji amarillo, red onion, sea salt\n\n-coconut milk, jalape\u00f1o, chives, yams, andean corn, seaweed salad\n\n-squid, halibut, prawn, clam, cilantro, red onion, rocoto aji, lime juice, sea salt\n\n-lomo saltado:  wok fried tenderloin steak strips, onion, tomato, cilantro, soy, french fries, steamed rice\n\n-pulled chicken stew, aji amarillo cream, yukon potatoes, soft-boiled eggs, walnuts, steamed rice\n\n-drinks:  pisco sour and iced tea\n\nTotal bill:  around $70 before tip\n\nPisco sour was mm mmm GOOD.  Lomo saltado was okay, nowhere near as good as in Lima or Cusco.  Pulled chicken stew was creamy and hearty--pretty authentic.  Outstanding lobster and crab ceviche. \n\nFresca has good food, just not sure how authentic it is.  If you've never had Peruvian food, you'll love it here.  You may be a little disappointed if you've had the real deal though.  I'd return.  It's a fun place, service is good, and the pisco sour really brought me back!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

So, this review covers my entire experience there.\n\nThe oysters and ceviches - all really good, I don't think you can go wrong there.  Also - you can be a food snob and think that coconut crusted shrimp are 70s/80s and that you're above them - but then you'd be missing a really nice appetizer.\n\nWine list is ok.

They also have booths which are slightly more separated.\nThe cocktail list is extensive, with a huge collection of pisco-based drinks, which are fantastic.  In fact, all the cocktails I've had have been fantastic.\nThe food menu isn't terribly extensive, but it covers fish, meat, and fowl as well as a number of smaller appetizers, soups, and salads.  There's also the large ceviche section.  We got a 3-ceviche sampler, which is served as 3 fairly small servings of ceviche and a fourth space full of Peruvian corn, which is great.  The ahi tuna and classic 5-element ceviches were both fantastic; the tiradito was the only disappointment, as the fish was a bit fishy.\n\nAlso know that their salmon is wild Atlantic, which is incredibly overfished and totally unsustainable.  They need to change this.\n\nOther than that one bit of imperfection, the food is fantastic, though it's on the pricey side.  We both ended up getting the special, which was a dungeness crab-stuffed trout, served with rice, spinach, and a fantastic rich, spicy sauce with sauteed onions.  The fish was whole, though remarkably well de-boned for a white fish, and filled past bursting with an astounding amount of crab.  I might go so far as to describe it as miraculously good.  Rich, incredibly flavorful, flawlessly cooked and tender, and incredibly fresh.  Utterly fantastic.\n\nReservations recommended, as it's pretty popular & crowded, unless you don't mind sitting at the oyster bar, in which case you can probably be seated right away.  You get stuck looking at the only bluish fluorescent light in the place, though, which isn't so good for the ambiance.\n\nI think I like the West Portal location slightly better - it's a bit less popular, and perhaps a bit cheaper.  They also have a bigger selection of what I assume are traditional Peruvian dishes, whereas this location has more what I'd consider American standards, like rib-eye steak and lamb chops.  Our dinner (2 cocktails, ceviche sampler, and 2 mains) came to about $95 after tip.  Pricey, but reasonable.", "author": "Don H."}

I am remarrying Fresca Fillmore and I'm never looking back. \n\nSo I walk into an almost-empty Fresca today and am immediately told by the hostess, in a bitchy bitchy way, that they can not accommodate 7 of us. Hmmm...I see about 8 different tables you could easily push together...apparently, the manager felt the same way and directed her to make it work. She then snarkily replies with a sigh and a roll of the eyes, \"you got lucky today\". Excuse me?!?! No, bitch! YOU got lucky- I brought in 7 starving people just dying to throw money at your establishment and tip really really well on the way out!\n\nThe table was prepped in about 10 minutes but then they wouldn't allow 6 of us to sit down until the 7th member of our party arrived! Once I began laughing out loud and expressing my amazement at the abysmal customer service, the manager - pursed lips and all- takes us to our table. Keep in mind- the place is still half empty. \n\nOur server was adorable but even she couldn't make the 3 hours it took for us to order, eat, and pay any less painless. The food took over an hour to come out, we weren't initially brought the pitcher of mimosas that every other party had (even though we'd ordered mimosas all around), and it took another 40 minutes to get our check after we finished our meal. Then no one bothered to process our credit cards until I walked them up to the manager myself. He couldn't have made his irritation more apparent. He immediately placed our cards next to the hostess station and walks away...20 minutes later, we are still waiting to get our cards back. Screw. That.\n\nThanks, jerks: I missed my spa appointment because of your slow, crappy service. Waitress- you're wonderful (two stars for you alone) but you're way better than this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-23", "description": "The experience started badly but finished well, and the bad at the beginning ends up as the only negative.\n\nWe visited Fresca with my Mother-in-Law, who happens to live in the Bay Area, and her friend on our recent visit. I was a little concerned, based on the mixed reviews of late I had read. However, we had a reservation, the menu seemed cool, and it seemed like a great place to try (incidentally, it was the night before Bay 2 Breakers, so we figured it would be safe for pre-run dinner). I went in with zero expectations but with my guard a little up. \n\nThey were full at 6:55 on a Saturday evening, so it was fully excusable that we would have to wait a few minutes. (Sidenote: the restaurant is not huge, and while they were full, they weren't busy...everything seemed to be running normally.) We grabbed a couple of seats at the end of the bar, which was about half-filled. I figured out why a few minutes later no one wanted to sit there.\n\nWe were greeted immediately by a shorter Latino bartender (Everth, or so the sales slip said) who seemed more concerned with his appearance than his service. When we asked for a minute to browse, he huffed away, started flirting with some girls at the end of the bar (refilling their sangria glasses on the house more than once and winking, etc.), washed some dishes, walked to the other end of the bar to flirt some more, as if to prove a point that if we weren't ready on HIS time, we would have to wait, even though he was not busy. He came back about ten minutes later, took our order, demanded payment (instead of asking if we wanted to open a tab or get an appetizer while we waited), and then he proceeded to screw up processing my credit card...because he was not paying attention when he ran it and ran it on someone else's tab. He refused to tell me what was wrong (after about five minutes of seeing him try to correct his mistakes, we could figure out he'd done something incorrectly) and runs off to get the manager to void the transaction. When he brought my slip, he still refused to admit he'd made a mistake (honesty and sincerity would have earned him a tip, but in light of his actions, and his insulting my Mom-in-Law's wish to briefly look over the menu, I saw his behavior a little inexcusable...having served or bartended in college and grad school, I am fine when someone makes a mistake, but I find it inexcusable to make a mistake because you're too preoccupied flirting and not paying attention, especially when you're not busy and being territorial about when your patrons order drinks on your terms, not theirs...that's not how the service industry works, papi.)\n\nAfter about a total wait-time of 25 minutes, which was perfectly fine considering it was peak time on a Saturday evening, we were seated, along with two other tables. It was obvious that our server had been triple-seated; however, he was a rock star in his service and worked all three tables together. He was an attractive guy in his early 40s, tanned with slick-backed hair, but I never found out his name. He saved our experience. He made no mistakes, had fantastic recommendations, and even took the time to amuse us, making animal shapes from our napkins when someone went to the restroom (yes, a little novel, but that's also what made it fun and silly, but it demonstrated that he was our server and it was his job to make our experience enjoyable, pleasant and fun...a little different from the dude at the bar.)\n\nInsofar as the meal, we had the jalea mixta as an appetizer, and it was very good. My only concern was that the crispiness might be overbearing; it seemed to take away some of the flavor elements. My husband and I split the Arroz con Mariscos, which is the \"Peruvian-style green paella,\" and I'm glad we did split it, as it was a huge dish but a perfect item to split! I can't rave enough about the flavors. I also tried my Mother-in-Law's salmon; it came with a squid ink calamari rice that was tender yet flavor-robust, and the dill chimichurri was equally flavorful. \n\nOur table server led us in the right directions with our meal choices, and he was well-tipped because of his knowledge and his service, his friendliness and personality. He was pretty, but unlike our bartender, he didn't let his prettiness overpower the job he was there to do. It truly was a tale of two service experiences, and in the end his performance saved the night. I wish I knew his name, because I would recommend sitting in his section. I can't recommend him highly enough, and I hope management reads this and acknowledges how good he is. I can't say the same about the bartender. Perhaps making him a food runner or dishwasher for a week might remind him of what he's there to do, and that being nice to your patrons is the difference in what those patrons say to their friends about their experience. I have to take away a star for his terrible and offensive performance, but if it were based on the table server, this place would get five stars.", "author": "Mike H."}

Then explain how they earned two stars. \n\nSo the food is decent and the drinks are strong. We really enjoyed our choros al vapor. IF (big if) I ever go back that is what I would get. It is actually very reasonably priced compared to the rest of the menu. The bread with olive tapenade was tasty; we had quite a bit of that during the 2.5 HOURS it took for them to feed 3 girls who only ordered appetizers and ceviche. \n\nThings looked positive when we got seated promptly without a reservation on Thursday evening. We had a charming waiter who got our drink order right away. That was about the fastest part of the evening. 20 minutes later our drinks showed up. As a former bartender that seems a bit on the slow side but they were strong and pretty tasty. \n\nWe then ordered the six item ceviche sampler. It took a while to get to our table and when it did we were underwhelmed by the portions. For $26 bucks I would expect more and they didn't even serve them with chips. Exsqeeze me but how the heck are we supposed to eat this? So we had to order the plantain chips which were $5 for about 12 chips. Lame. The table next to us had much faster service and they got a single order of the ceviche which was significantly larger than the combined total of our six measly portions. Super lame. \n\nAnd now friends we have entered what I like to call the Service Desert. We sat and sat and sat. Got sober from sitting so long. Sat some more. Then guess what? We sat. If we had been conducting a secret confidential meeting it would have been perfect because not a soul would have interrupted us. But for dinner, birthday dinner at that, it was slightly off-putting. \n\nSo sometime the following day our server (still charming) returned to our table. He did recognize after a few lighthearted jabs that we had noticed the lack of attention. We were then able to order another round of drinks, more edibles and more bread. \n\nSo we got the bread but all of our plates had been cleared and no replacements were provided. The birthday girl took matters into her own hands and asked the cooks if we could have some plates. Then we joked about having to tip her and pay for stupid healthy SF for her too (they charge you for that because apparently they are too cheap to provide for their staff). \n\nSo we ate more bread. We ran out. Flagged down a passing employee to get us more. We finished that and asked for more. No we were not carbo loading. We just had a lot of time to kill and tummies to fill. So we got more bread. \n\nOur food arrived. The hongos, choros al vapor and oysters were tasty. The risotto cake not so much. \n\nOur server felt bad about the hiccup in service so he gave us desert. Pretty yummy flan and the price was right (free). \n\nWe had to flag him down to get our bill. Two of us split the meal for the birthday girl. He came back and said my card was decline. I disagreed because I had just checked the balance earlier in the day. He went back and ran it again. Low and behold it worked. \n\nAnyways to sum it all up. I did enjoy the food especially the mussels, but their service was not up to snuff. I have gotten more attention at a McDonald's. When I pay for service I expect service. Coming from the industry, I do tip very generously when the situation warrants but I could barely bring myself to leave 13%. I felt bad for the server but that's the way it went down. \n\nSorry Fresca I don't think I can stomach your premium prices and dismal service again. So sad that our relationship had to end after only one date. I just don't see us working out.", "author": "colleen b."}

But I still revere Ishiguro's writing and think he's one of the best looking writers (such a cutie!).  We decided to discuss the next round of possible books while eating at Fresca.\n\nMy first time here.  We were seated at a round booth...nearby us, there was a small petite woman with the largest lamb shank on her table.  Rachel and I were eyeing the lamb shank.  \n\nRachel: It's a large lamb shank.\nMe: It's very large.\nRachel: She's very small.\nMe: The shank is the size of her head.\nLeandro: Let's get some ceviches.\nKarl: Sounds good.

After spending 10 days in Peru, I can say that Fresca's chefs come pretty darn close to the food in Lima and Cuzco, but they miss the bullseye, perhaps deliberately. \n\nTo start, order a ceviche dish (kind of like sushi), which is a staple in Lima. The advantage here is that ceviche in SF won't give you intestinal infections like the sewage-tainted ceviche in Lima.  If you really want to dare yourself, order the BLACK ceviche, made with squid ink for extra entertainment.  ;)   \n\nAny of the other non-steak appetizers are safe bets, although again you'll be eating Americanized tapas with a slight Peruvian influence. \n\nFor your main course, just pick your passion and don't look at the price. I certainly recommend the Peruvian paella, which again mirrors paella in Lima. Chicken dishes are safe too, such as the pulled chicken or the Peruvian-style rotisserie chicken, but here we go again-- these are cliches, not authentic cuisine. All of the lamb dishes are wonderful, and yes I've tried every one of them.  \n\nThe reason there is so much lamb on the menu is probably to compensate for the lack of llama meat (or alpaca meat). In Cuzco, we ate alpaca on skewers, and this was easily the best part of the culinary tour of Peru. Alpaca and llama, mmmmmmmm.  One day, Fresca may go out on a limb and serve it (if they can navigate through all the regulatory red tape).\n\nTime for dessert. Something sublime awaits you, though it's Mexican, not Peruvian... the Tres Leches Cake is hands-down the best I've ever tasted. It's made from three types of milk (duhhh), every morsel to savor, and the cake will become a lifetime favorite of your palate.\n\nDo NOT order any Peruvian wine here. Do you think I'm kidding? Just ask the waitress, and she'll most likely say the same thing. Go with tart Chilean or Argentine wine from the Mendoza region.", "author": "Daniel C."}

We started with a ceviche tasting; they have several different types, and you can order tastings with 3, 4, 5, or 6 different kinds.  Alas, we skipped the salmon because it was wild Atlantic (environmental no-no), but the traditional, halibut, and ahi tuna that we had were all fabulous.\n\nThe night we were there, the special was trout stuffed with crab in a pepper sauce with spinach, which we both ordered.  And WOW.  I couldn't believe how much crab there was (and tasty, too).  For $22, it was a ridiculous amount of high-quality seafood.  The sauce reminded me a little of sweet and sour, but spicier, and non-Asian-tasting.  We had extra sauce so we asked our server for bread for sopping, which was also great.

The inside looked very classy with the lights lit just right to give a very warm ambiance. \n\nWe reserved a table for 10 Saturday night and were seated pretty quick. Our server was very nice and attentive telling us the specials and also filling up everyone's water when it was half full (yup, an optimist). My girl and I ended up sharing a dish. It was the Pollo a la brasa which was a rotisserie chicken with french fries and salad. Everyone's order came pretty quick and all looked great. \n\nOur chicken was served into two pieces and when I first took a bite out of one of them, I noticed it was a bit dry... ugh... damn.. I took another bite from the other piece of chicken and it was better... a little more moist and juicy... but besides being a little dry, the chicken had some great spices on it. It reminded me of a light Indian curry taste to it... not too strong or not even much of a kick. The salad tasted really good.. the greens were fresh and the dressing wasn't too creamy. The side on the entree that surprised me the most though was the french fries.... what?!? french fries in a Peruvian restaurant... apparently fries are a big thing with their sides of food... \n\nThe food here is kinda expensive, especially if funds are getting low... Getting paid once a month sucks... I gotta learn to budget better!

The food was good (as always), but the service folks completely failed. From the hostess to the bartender to the waiter to the manager, no one provided even adequate customer service. That's ok when you're eating a quick bite at a diner, but when the average entree price is $30, you expect a little more.\n\nHere's some background. It was 7:30 and the restaurant was about three-quarters full. The bar had one woman sitting by herself and three other people eating apps. There were two hostesses, one manager, and an average number of waiters. They were not short-staffed, the volume of customers wasn't terribly high, and no one seemed harried or frantic. \n\nFirst, the bartender took 20 minutes to make four pisco sours. It was so extreme that the patron next to us commented on it. Weird.\n\nNext, the hostess told us that she couldn't transfer our bar tab to our table. Umm, again weird, but ok. Then, she asked us to carry our drinks to the table despite the fact that they were still being made and were unreachable behind the bar. Again, weird. I almost offered to bring my own food from the kitchen, too. I wish I had because (see the next point)...\n\nOur waiter was terrible. Aside from only checking with us once during the hour we were there, he forgot one of our dishes, brought the wrong wine, and didn't refill our water or wine glasses. He came up with the most unbelievable excuse for missing our dish -- the printer in the kitchen ran out of paper. Possible, but why did all our other food come out without issue? Again, weird.\n\nFinally, when my boyfriend (who is a waiter himself) spoke to the manager about the poor service, the manager acted bored! Wow. He didn't even apologize, just said, \"Thanks for your feedback.\" Customer complaints must be so frequent that he has come up with that standard non-response. \n\nIf just one or two of these things had happened, I would have overlooked it and given a much higher rating. As it is, it was an hour full of disappointments and mistakes. It's clear that the management of that restaurant is not paying any attention to the front of the house.

The SALMON WITH PASSIONFRUIT was good, it had just the rite amount of sweetness and a hint of sourness in it.  The HAMACHI was the best.  I forgot what they use for the sauce, but it tasted like it's got soy sauce and wasabi in it.  Overall they were fresh and had nice presentation.  But more expensive than Japanese sashimi for the small portions that they were served.\n\nThe PISTACHIO CRUSTED LAMB CHOPS was great.  We asked for medium rare and that's exactly how it came out to be.  The demi glaze complemented the meat well.\n\nThe GRILLED PORK CHOP was thick cut, served with mango salsa, plantains, and rice.  It was not dry at all, but the meat had minimal marinade, and the salsa made it alittle too sweet for my taste.\n\nMANGO CHEESECAKE was creamy, didn't taste like actual mango, but instead tasted like mango pudding.  It's a nice big slice enough to share between two people.  \n\nWe would come back again because the neighborhood is nice with easy street parking.  Maybe will go on warm afternoon to take advantage of the outdoor seatting.\n\n****They accept RESTAURANT.COM dining certificates.*****", "author": "Tadaa T."}

It's a great room - lots of skylights, nicely preserved moldings around the ceiling, and a aqua/teal-ish accent color behind the mirrors and in the cozy nook behind the ceviche bar.  The flooring and wood ceiling make for lots of bouncing noises, so expect to speak a little more loudly than you might normally.\n\nWe tried the Marin Majita oysters, which were delicious - skip the cocktail sauce (which is basically spicy ketchup), and go for the lemon and their garlic/butter-ish sauce.\n\nWe'd have liked to have next tried the ceviche, but there wasn't enough room/time.  I had the new york steak with purple potatoes, marinated mushrooms and tomato chimichurri.  The steak was done perfectly, the potatoes tender and coloful, the mushrooms were amazing, and the chimichurri wasn't as overpowering as its mint original.  A great balance, and a hearty portion of food.  \n\nMy friend had the other steak dish with rice, red peppers and frittes...his steak had a smokier flavor, and was also very well prepared - but serving two carb-y sides in one dish seemed odd to him (and to me).\n\nService was middle of the road.  Bread was delivered once (and eaten) before our appetizer course was through and never refilled (nor were we asked if we wanted more).  Water glasses weren't refilled until dessert menus were delivered.  Well, the guise of dessert menus - apparently, the happy hour/bar menu looks the same as the dessert menu, so we were presented with drink specials and mussels-and-chorizo dishes for dessert.  That lost the sale (well, that and we'd had plenty to eat).\n\nService aside, the food is the centerpiece here, and it's very good.  I would bring people back.", "author": "Evan G."}

This is why they get 5 stars!\n\nGod I want to cry just thinking about it. I am a sucker for lobster as it is, but it was just perfect. A big tail over a bowl of risotto (easy to remove from shell) and the empty shell head on it for a very cool presentation (helloooo lobster). \n\nThe risotto had the 2 lobster claws in it (maybe better than the tail meat!!) as well as big piles of fresh dungeness crab meat. The crab meat was still cold in the middle, which I actually liked because you could taste the freshness of the meat, and knew it came right off the ceviche bar. The risotto was intensely buttery (so if you don't like uber-rich buttery stuff, don't get it, luckily, I do) with peas and (maybe) white asparagus. It was heaven from the first bite to the last..  PERFECTION.\n\nWe went with the BFs family too, so we got a ton of ceviche. As always, Fresca's ceviche is amazing. The 5 Elements is good, the Mixto is good, the Black Ceviche is good.. we also got the pomegranate ceviche special which is really nice, with cucumbers and mango slices. I could eat ceviche every single day and be a happy girl.\n\nOther yummies at Fresca: the Cojito (like a mojito but with coco leaf infused rum.. so good). The mariscos con arroz... lots of seafood and spicy. I have had the ahi mignon and the lamb, both killer. The boyfriend almost always gets loma saltado, and it's good. \n\nThis place is not traditional Peruvian, so you should not even go in there thinking that... but if you order wisely, you can have a fantastic meal.

Came here and we were seated immediately but it took over 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order. It wasn't even packed.\n\nIt took at least another 15 minutes before we could flag him down to ask for bread. Then we waited another 15-20 minutes for the food to come and that probably sat on the counter for a while since it was lukewarm. We ordered garlic fries but they were definitely not. What were they?? Soggy and bland with no salt.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich was very dry as well without much flavor. Everyone in our party was thoroughly disgusted with lunch. $42 for lunch for a party of 4 and we feel totally ripped off of a meal and hungry with no appetite.", "author": "Elena R."}

However, my favorite is this location in Noe Valley.\n\nGreat meeting place for drinks and/or a meal.  I love the intimate setting; with private tables for two and large booths for a party of six.  The wait is never that long and with the great boutiques next door, you'll never get bored!\n\nMy favorite meal is the Toro Steak Salad, and the tequeos are to die for!  Decent selection of wine and drinks.  I can go on and on and on about this place, but I won't b/c there are over 180 other reviews that hopefully also sing its praises.  \n\nThe only drawback is the parking situation.

It was quiet and cozy, and our server was very welcoming and patient as we took our time scanning through every item on the menu.  As we were feeling a little indecisive, we asked the server for recommendations - and he made some great ones!  I drank a traditional Peruvian cocktail, a Pisco Sour, and my boyfriend had a beer.  We started with the mix ceviche - amazing.  The fish was fresh, and the flavors were bright and intense.  We had a chicken stew dish as the main course - also solid.  Great place for drinks and apps, but if you end up staying for dinner, it's great too.

I did offer my boyfriend to cook dinner, but he had to make it up to me, so he decided to take us out to Fresca. We have only tried the one on Fillmore, but not yet this one on 24th. We made reservation just to be cautious of the waiting line. Last time we went to the Fillmore location at 8 ish on a Sunday and there was a wait! \n\nSo we drove down Bernal Heights area. It's so near my home, yet I have not explore it enough. As we drove there is a cozy feeling of being a San Franciscan. The streets were filled with sort of victorian houses and boutique shops. So drove on 24th street, and to my surprised there were plenty of parkings. We parked just a couple step away from Fresca. We also arrived about 10 mins prior to our reservation @ 8PM. \n\nThis location has more seatings, and was a lot more roomy. Nicer decor and I felt less suffocated. It was not packed *SURPRISED*. There were plenty of seatings actually. We were seated by the waitress. Service usually is exceptional. Menu were slightly different, but still pretty much the same. They also gave us bread w/ olive spread, something that the other place didn't give.\n\nWe ordered:\n*ceviche mixto - squid, halibut, prawn, clam, cilantro, red onion, rocoto aji, lime juice, sea salt\n*lobster causa - yellow chili infused potato , citrus poached \nlobster ,avocado corn relish, rocoto aioli, huancaina \n*arroz con mariscos - aji panca spiced rice, calamari, clams, mussels, prawns, fish, scallops, cilantro, chicha de jora fume.\n\n*2 shirley temples. \n\nTotal was about $74 dollars\n\nI enjoyed the ceviche, but wouldn't recommend the spinach salad. We asked the waitress if she would prefer the Lobster Causa or the Scallops(I had this before it was delicious!). She recommended the scallops. I was a bit disappointed. Paellella was served in a plate/bowl rather than in a small skillet, but the rice taste the same. Absolutely delicious. Overall, it was okay to good. I'd come back in a couple of months though.

My fiance and I decide we want to go out for dinner instead of our other options which include a) ordering something to be delivered or b) going to the grocery store to buy food then coming home to prepare it.  Both options seemed unappealing to us - so I gave Fresca a call to see if we could make a reservation.  They were booked but said that there was plenty of room at the ceviche bar or at the front bar.  We put on our shoes, prepared to take a chance.\n\nWhen we got there, they actually had a table that they were able to give to us!  Very nice.  We start off with a cocktail - martini for him and strawberry margarita for her.  The strawberry margarita was delicious!  Like a margarita on the rocks with whole strawberries in it :)\n\nSince I'd read in some previous reviews that the portions were large and because we like to taste a little of a lot of things...we ordered some ceviche, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert...all to share and it was the perfect amount!\n\nSplit the ceviche chino - very good, ever so slightly too much salt, but really excellent tuna and I loved the won ton chip.\n\nSplit the conchitas y quinoa - yum, Yum, and YUM!  The scallops were very good, the quinoa on top was somewhat unnoticeable, but the cream of white bean, truffle, and lobster sauce that it was served on was INCREDIBLE!\n\nNext comes dinner...we had all this seafood and kinda wanted to stick with the theme...so we went with the duck.  They eat seafood, that counts, right?  It was also just delicious.  Served with a risotto of sorts, it was flavorful and the meat practically fell apart.  Again, ever so slightly too much salt, but all is forgiven if it tastes that good.  If I had had to eat this dish by myself - I would have been VERY uncomfortable...it was a lot of food...but man, I'll go back just for that.\n\nDessert anyone?  We went with the rice pudding.  It was served warm with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries on top.  Perfect to split and just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nOn a side note, not solely directed at Fresca, why is it that appetizer dishes always come in threes?  Three of the ceviche chinos.  Three of the scallops.  How often do you dine with a group that is divisible by three?  Isn't it usually two or four?  Why not offer a per portion cost - like sushi?  I'm totally over it...we just split the third one...but it seems to be a standard number and I'm not sure I understand why?!", "author": "Kelly M."}

They were accommodating enough to seat the 10 of us (then 2 more later on, for a total of 12) without having to squeeze us in a tiny area--but then again, the restaurant was pretty empty.  Besides our party, I'd say there were a few smaller groups scattered throughout the restaurant.\n\nAnd we were looking forward to Sunday Brunch and bottomless mimosas.  I have to say that their mimosas aren't bad, though the mixture of champagne to OJ was pretty inconsistent throughout our meal.  I liked that they used fresh-OJ--you could taste the pulp--but the refills were waaay too slow.  Way to be stingy when you're advertising \"bottomless mimosas,\" you know?  It took forever for the waiter to refill our mimosas and when he did, he'd fill our glasses barely 2/3 full.  By the end of the meal I was pretty irritated that multiple people from our group needed to ask for refills, which would be filled sparingly after a long wait.\n\nThe food I had wasn't so bad.  Their oysters are very fresh.  My crabcake benedict was very tasty as well (you know it's a good crabcake when the abundance of crab meat reigns over the bread crumbs), and all the plates were nicely set.  There were a few complaints about dishes being served cold so that the cheese from an omelette had curdled (probably since they tried to serve all of us at the same time), and two different flies ended up in two different friends' glasses.\n\nI had a good time because of the company I was with, the oysters, and my friend and I getting our moneys worth drinking 5 glasses of mimosas, but I'd probably suggest somewhere else for bottomless mimosa brunch, or coming with a smaller group of people.", "author": "Ashley S."}

I don't know what happended in the last few years but everything went downhill with the service and food.

That should have been our sign to leave.  This guy takes our order but he doesn't take it down in writing so he returns back 5 minutes later and asked us for our order again..WTF why did you ask if you were just going to do that??

Our brunch started on a good note since we all ordered mimosas and our waiter asked us if we would like a mimosa at $8 or bottomless for $12...of course we all said that we would preferred the bottomless option. \n\nWell after 3 carafes of mimosa in a time span of 2.5 hours in between 3 adults (who just spent a fortune on brunch and tipped our waiter at least 20% for the fast service)...we my friends, sorry to say were cutoff in the rudest way and pretty much shown the door to exit. The waiter had placed the carafe of mimosa on our table and the manager wasn't pleased with this so she took this carafe from our table and told the bartender not to serve us. I went up to the bartender and asked if we could purchase another drink since we weren't allowed to ask for more mimosas but the manager came up to me the rudest way and sensing that I knew Spanish started talking down to me in Spanish...the couple at the bar (who observed and understood the entire situation and who happens to work at a law-firm) told me to send the owner of Fresca a letter since they were appalled at the disrespect we received as paying customers. BTW thanks for your help and business card Maritza.\n\nI wouldn't be upset if the situation was that we were drunk and unruly BUT WE WERE NOT we just went to brunch (12ish) spent 2.5 hours catching up with a friend we hadn't seen in a while over \"bottomless\" mimosas and overpriced brunch!!! The couple at the bar told us that they would not have ever noticed us if it weren't for the manager, Milagros, who disrupted the tranquil ambiance of the restaurant with such an embarrassing scene. \n\nSo long story short: \n-- \"bottomless\" mimosas with a VERY LARGE BOTTOM ON THESE MIMOSAS = $12 ea. \n-- Brunch = $125 \n-- Tip for fast service (really normal service at a different restaurant but that's a whole different story) = $25 \n\n--- Being cutoff, disrespected, and kicked out of a restaurant by a crabby miserable old manager (Milagros) = priceless\n\nThis was my 3rd and last time I go to Fresca...and I will make sure to let the dozen friends I introduced to this place know about this ordeal.", "author": "Violeta E."}

Though the menu and portions are clearly not intended for family-style ordering, that's what we did so we could try the maximum number of dishes, and it worked out well.  As others before me have said, you must order the ceviche.  We had the ceviche de coco - white tuna literally bursting with citrus deliciousness - and the ceviche chino - ahi tuna that defies description.  We also tried the empanadas which were delicious.  \n\nThe sweet potato gratin that comes with the lenguado entree is to die for.  I have never had a sweet potato that tasted quite like that.  Similarly, the risotto-stuffed bell pepper with manchego cheese was fab.  And last but not least - dessert.  We couldn't decide and so we ordered no less than FOUR desserts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-03", "description": "I don't know a damn thing about food from Peru, other than guinea pig being a local delicacy. (see: Destino (http://www.qype.co.uk/place/172044-Destino-San-Francisco) ) But as someone who's eaten his way around half the world and then some, I know when something tastes right. I can detect the mana of the food... the essence... the mojo, if you will.\n\n\n I think I can tell whether something's been gussied up all \"nouveau\" style or is staying true to its traditional roots.\n\n\n It's pretty easy to tell, actually. Are they using potatoes? Or \"artisanally steamed fingerling potatoes shaved with a Santori peeler?\" Rice? Or \"Tuscan-sourced cedar box conditioned arborio rice?\" Beef? Or \"dry aged pasture grazed beef?\"\n\n\n Although many will argue that top-notch ingredients can set a meal apart from the pack, it helps to have a basic recipe. All the fancy ingredients in the world won't help you if you can't assemble them into a memorable, satisfying package, a concept many nouveau-ethnic chefs/restauranteurs are seeming to forget.\n\n\n And of the 40,000+ Peruvian outlets that have sprouted like mushrooms all over San Francisco in recent years, this gringo can haughtily say that Fresca nails it. The dishes all seem to be derived from traditional recipes, the portions are huge and hearty, and there's a wide array of meats and starches to satisfy any appetite.\n\n\n Certainly, Fresca isn't free of trendy restaurant trappings. It's got moderately upmarket prices, fancy cocktails, raw oysters, and bottomless mimosas at brunch. Not exactly what you'd call down home South American eatin'. But all those things take second billing to the rich, delicious, fresh food. Rather than stake its reputation on microgreen-topped presentations or minimalist platings, Fresca lets you stuff yourself... in style.\n\n\n Now maybe I'm all wrong. Maybe someone of Peruvian descent will tell me, \"Dude, no, you're supposed to have your ceviche buried in frisee, and there's, like, 3 luxry beef ranches outside of Lima.\" But until then, I can be found digging into my Arroz con Mariscos and chugging mimosas, sangrias, and pisco at Fresca.\n\n\n Other locations in West Portal and Fillmore.", "author": "Omid T."}

The service was really poor, but food was good. Didn't really think anything of it as it was a great evening with friends and drink so no big deal. Second visit happened to be walking the dog on a beautiful Sunday morning in Noe, dropped in on an open table outside and had a excellent breakfast with excellent service (french toast was amazing!!!). Left me thinking maybe the service experience at the bar was an anomaly. Last night, well, last night took Fresca off the options list. Arrived at Fresca at 830PM, no reservations, and the restaurant was busy. No problem, we were patient and ready to wait. Surprisingly, get sat within minutes. Then the wait began. I don't mind waiting, its part of eating out in the city with no reservations. But once I'm seated, the clock starts. At 5 minutes without being acknowledged, its getting uncomfortable. At 10 minutes, we're pulling up and heading out the door. There were three waiters working around us, not a single hello, I'll be right with you, or even water to the table. Experience has taught me that when it starts out bad, it does not get better. With so many GREAT restaurants in the city, there is simply no reason to accept such disregard. Ironically as we are walking out we make eye contact with the waiter who is picking up our menus and immediately handing to an adjacent table, we literally started laughing. The best part? Getting on Yelp, finding a new to us Firefly up the street with GREAT reviews, calling and getting right in, and enjoying an amazing meal with excellent service, for what turned into a very enjoyable experience.", "author": "Rob B."}

The menu alluded to a lot of very complex flavors and sophisticated culinary ninja skills, but really didn't deliver on the expectations... the Arroz con Mariscos was WAY too much rice and WAY too little pizazz for the price, and the halibut wasn't really seasoned too well... big ups to the risotto cake, though, that was a tasty morsel.\n\nJust a note:  they garnish/incorporate a lot of things with these really weird GIGANTIC kernels of some kind of corn... they don't taste like anything and have a waxy texture... so just nudge them to the side of whatever you're eating.", "author": "Laura F."}

So why am I giving this place 4 stars? \n\nIn a word, ceviche.\n\nThe ceviche I've had in most places outside of Peru has been overly acidic from sitting in too much lemon or lime juice for too long.

There is a nice selection of different fishes and sauces, and the ceviche sampler is a good way to go if you're having a hard time making up your mind.\n\nCome to think of it, I'm way overdue for a return trip to Fresca.", "author": "Walter P."}

Aside from the ceviche the menu has a great variety of unique entrees involving different types of both meat and seafood.  On my last visit I had the wild salmon with squid ink rise and it was a great choice.  Aside from the rice being slightly salty, the sauce and the salmon were a perfect match.\n\nFinally, the service is great.

So I was looking forward to my first time at Fresca.  \n\nOur party of 7 went on a Sunday night to the Noe Valley site.  The place was not that busy, yet even with our reservations, we waited 20 minutes for our table.  Granted that one of our party came later, but if your restaurant is not busy, why not seat your patrons.  \n\nWe brought a couple bottles of wine, which was a $15/bottle corkage fee.  Our wine server announced this upfront and it was also on the website, so no surprises.  She was funny and warm and kept our glasses filled throughout the night.  \n\nBut then our food server came - geez, what happened?  She was rather stiff and a bit snobby.  We ordered 5 tapas, not being terribly hungry but wanting to eat some and catch up.  Apparently the portions are small, so the server recommended more - that's always a nice service but this is where her being snobby came in.  She made us feel like we were trying to be cheap.  Excuse us for being new...  \n\nWe ordered:\n6 Ceviche sampler - tried all but the chino.  Nice.\nCausa Andina - tasty\nPaella - good filler, not too salty\nLomo saltado - tender\n1-2 other meat dishes\n\nFood: 3 stars \nService: 3 stars\nAmbiance: 2 stars\nOverall: Meh, I could pass - there's a problem that I can't remember all the orders.

Of course Fresca  was fairly packed, but we were able to snatch 2 seats at the Ceviche bar! Woohooo - I love sitting at the food bars and watch the chefs work away!\n\nAfter quickly looking through the menu and watching the chef prepping a couple of Ceviche plates, we decided on the Ceviche Costanera, the Tiradito and a couple of oysters. \nWhile anxiously waiting for my pisco sour (which came with a light delay), the oysters made their way to our seats. Wait - these are four not a couple. Ohhhhh recommendation from the chef, two extra ones from his favorite stack. \nAll happy smiles, I dug in while the Tiradito and the Ceviche Costanera came out as well. Three plates in front of us, suddenly a  fourth plate shows up... with recommendations from the Ceviche chef as well, his personal favorite: Ceviche de Coco.  \nWowzer - not only were we joking around with him but he completely spoiled us with some free full size appetizer samples! OMG and everything was simply delicious but I think secretly we both were wondering how we are gonna chow down another hot starter and an entr\u00e9e! \nThankfully we didn't have much time to think about it, when the Camarones Chicama arrived. These coconut crusted jumbo prawns didn't really have a chance against us since the sweet and savory orange glaze made it just too easy to go down. By now our stuffed stomachs had developed some sort of fighting spirit and when the steaming hot  parihuela - a peruvian style bouillabaisse - arrived, we couldn't wait to taste the spicy tomato-y broth. The Parihuela reminded me on a Cioppino - as savory but spicier!\nBaaaaaaam and believe it or not but we managed to order dessert as well, tres leches - a milky, (pretty) sweet soaked sponge cake with caramel sauce and Dulce de Leche ice cream. \n\nOn the food side, both of us were very pleased and enjoyed every single dish (the corn on the tiradita was exceptional!). The service was a little slow and not overly attentive but the Ceviche chef's special treats made up for it! Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere; Even though considered a chain in SF, the ambiance is more like a cozy neighborhood spot.

It took another five minutes for the server to finally greet us and take our orders. By the time our drinks had arrived, we'd forgotten we'd ordered them. I was hoping the food would make up for the terrible service, but it did not. The ceviche was chewy, our hot food was served on cold plates, and my fries were limp/soggy.\n\nClearly it was an understaffed \"B team\" working the lunch shift, both in the front and the back of the house.\n\nThe bad service continued. I never got the new fries I'd asked for, my brother had to walk up to the server to ask for to-go boxes, then to ask for the check, then to provide him the credit card, and it still took us forever to finally leave.\n\nAt no point did the server or the manager apologize for the terrible service or wait times.\n\nI will never eat at Fresca again, even for dinner, purely on the principle that I can't support an establishment where I had such a terrible experience.", "author": "Garrett O."}

I love Peruvian food and can't find some of the things that are on the menu as readily as I used to be able to before I moved to the Bay.  OMG, don't ever pass up:\n\n1. Lomo Saltado, my one true defining dish that I have to order at any Peruvian restaurant to judge its authentic-ness.  Aside from them not mixing in the papas fritas (French fries, don't knock it until you try it), the dish was like I was eating at the Embarcadero Restaurant in Lima, Peru..No gals and dolls, not the Embarcadero as in Ferry building or Ballpark.  \n\n2. The Causa- tan requisimo como estado comiendo en Peru!!!!  \nTranslation: It was just as good as if I was eating in Peru!!!\n\n3. Pan con Lomito- It's like a Panini but with so much more flavor and intense but not over powering spices..it's was just right.  \n\n4. And as if I don't have you drooling enough, their Mimosas are bottomless and only $7.  If I remember right, I had six or 7 of them.  \n\nThe serving staff is always so nice and they are professional without the stuffiness.  The server remembered me from my previous visit a month ago and even when you walk past the open kitchen, all the chefs and cooks turn around to say hello.\n\nParking is always tough on the street but they have a parking lot just a half block down that only costs $3 for 2 hours and $5 for 10 hours...totally worth not battling Noe Valley parking. \n\nVengan, coman y tenga un buen tiempo!\n\nTranslation: Come, eat and have a good time!!!!", "author": "C T."}

We came with a big group for a friend's birthday and I left underwhelmed.  \n\nI arrived a little early, so while I waited for the rest of my friends to arrive, I ordered a pisco sour to start.  So far, my impressions of this place were promising.  The pisco sour was quite good and packed a decent punch.  When we were finally seated, we perused the menu and I ended up splitting several dishes with a couple of different people I ended up getting a 6 plate mixed ceviche taster, shrimp and crab fried wontons, the parihuela - a peruvian style bouillabaisse and fried sweet plantains.  \n\nWe were left mostly to our own devices until the food arrived which wasn't terribly long.  The ceviche arrived first and looked promising with 6 little sampler plates.  The first bite was tasty, albeit a bit strong with the acid.  However, from there it started to go downhill.  Although with different names and different seafood, each ceviche kind of tasted the same.  Also, the acid overpowered most of the dishes and didn't allow any of the flavors of the seafood to come through.  This tended to be a trend with the other dishes.  The bouillabaisse similarly looked good with and abundance of seafood.  Unfortunately, you could have just as easily put little rubber pellets because I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference with the amount of tomato sauce involved.  The fried plantains lacked any crispiness but tasted fine.  The best dish was probably the fried wontons, but it's really hard to go wrong with fried shrimp, crab and cream cheese.  I also tasted a friend's paella which was nothing to write home about.  \n\nFor most of the evening, we were pretty much left to our own devices.  The wait staff was maybe not as attentive as one would like.  For the price point, I certainly expected better quality.  The biggest thing missing was probably balance; balance in flavors, balance in textures, balance in service.  I'd probably pass on returning here.", "author": "Gary L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-01-18", "description": "Just awful.  What makes this experience so painfully bad is that it totally had the potential to be a really decent meal, but they just blew it.  I would ALWAYS rather walk into a mediocre restaurant and get a mediocre meal than walk in to a nice place with high expectations and have it blow.\n\nThings started off pretty well.  We had called ahead and because of the friendly, encouraging tone of the woman who answered the phone, we took a cab all the way out there knowing that we would have to wait for a table at the bar.  Lauren and I ordered Margaritas with salt (festive!), well actually I ordered a Margarita with salt and Lauren ordered a Corona, but then \"upgraded\" her order when the bartender expressed jocular disappointment.  Whatever.  I had barely taken 2 sips of my Margarita (festive!) when the same nice lady from the phone told us our table was ready.  Sweet.  We sat.  I actually told Lauren \"I'm excited\" after spending a few moments perusing the menu.  \n\nSo many things sounded great.  A couple at the bar were served some sort of seared scallop appetizer while we were having our Margaritas, which looked and smelled just amazing.  I was tempted, but decided to go with some ceviche.  There were about eight different types of ceviche to choose from, so I was grateful for the sampler \"trio\", which I ordered.   For my entree, I ordered the Churrasco, which gave me some pause at $29.  I thought to myself as I ordered it, \"Well, it might be great.\"  It wasn't.  But I'll get to that.  \n\nOur appetizers came and were pretty good.  I thought the portions on the ceviche sampler were small.  It pissed me off to see that somebody at the adjacent table ordered a full order of one type of ceviche, but clearly got more than 3X what I got.  I paid more for the sampler than the price of any of the full order of one type cost.  So why should I pay a premium for the privilege of getting to try more than one type?  The difference in portion was ENORMOUS.  I had literally perhaps a tablespoon of each type of ceviche, while the girl next to me was served a burrito-sized amount of (wait for it) THE LOBSTER CEVICHE.  What lobster ceviche?, you may ask.  That's what I said.  Apparently our waiter just forgot to mention the day's specials to us.  Pissed.  \n\nTo fuel my pissedness, it begins to feel like a really long time is passing and our entrees are nowhere.  Another couple beside us who were seated after us get their entrees, (while still working on their appetizers) and I swear a tiny tumbleweed rolled across our table.  They ask the waiter if the entrees can go back to the kitchen while they finish their appetizers.  And here we are, seated fist, our own appetizers now a distant memory, entrees still MIA.  \n\nI realize that what's falling apart here at Fresca is not so much the food (which has the capacity to be really good), but the service and the management of the kitchen.  When the entrees are brought back to the couple next to us, the fellow takes a bite of his meat and declares, loudly, \"It's raw!\".  Now, that can be a totally subjective thing, we all realize.  But now this little disturbance is noticed and begins to have an effect on people sitting at other tables nearby.  I think you can dismiss the fact that the people at one table may not be having a good time, but when it's two tables, folks begin to notice and look over and begin to look concernedly at the manager.  \n\nYou could feel the mood sink a little in our corner of the restaurant, and everyone begins to look a little more suspiciously a little more appraisingly at the stuff on their own plates, and wonder \"Is this worth what I am paying for it?\".  Finally our entrees came, and it almost made me smile to discover that my own piece of meat was also quite \"raw\" -- no, not rare.  Had this been a better cut of meat, I might have been able to eat it as it was.  But the presence of so much gristle, fat and tendons made it impossible to get down.  By now  I had turned a corner in my own mind and had begun to think of the whole experience as almost funny.  I sent the \"steak\" back and thought that it was easily the worst piece of meat that's been served to me in the city of San Francisco.  Tad's would be like a 5 on the steak meter and this was a 3.  Just miserable quality.  It didn't help that it was served with some sort of over-salty, risotto-esque goop that I could scarcely console myself with.  The steak came back as shoe leather, which is the only possible result whenever you send a steak back.  \n\nOh, well.  We rose.  We left.  We'll never go back.   \n\nThis should really serve as a lesson to even the most venerated of eateries.  Even if your kitchen has the capacity to produce great food, the entire experience can still fall miserably apart if you don't have your shit together in the front of the house.  This is an expensive restaurant, so they have absolutely no excuse -- especially in this economy.  \n\nSpend your date-night dinner dollar somewhere else.", "author": "Jack M."}

For $15, you can try three different kinds and there are TONS to choose from.\nI got to sample the mixto, crab and lobster, and the tiradito.  My favorite was DEFINITELY the tiradito.  It was so spicy and delicious, yum yum.  The mixto was good, but the crab and lobster seemed kind of dry and had the consistency of canned tuna fish.  No bueno.\nFor the entree, I ordered the lenguado.  This was a crispy risotto cake topped with sauteed spinach topped with cooked tomatoes topped with a HUGE piece of pan seared halibut.  Dudes, the risotto cake was TASTY, but the pan seared halibut was a damn brick.  For reals.  You could knock out a fool with it.  It was SO HEAVY and completely overcooked.  I could only eat half, and it sat in my stomach for hours afterward.  So not good.\nMy friend ordered something called the segunda?  I'm not sure what it was, but it seemed like a ton of seafood swimming in gravy.  He seemed to enjoy it though.  \nAnd for drinks, we had Coca Sours.  These were BOOZY.  Watch out for these.  They also had Inca Kola on the menu, which was pretty cool.  \nThe only reason this place is three stars instead of four was the biatch who was to be our waitress.  She sucked.  \nTrio of ceviche + two drinks + two entrees = not a bad deal for damn near $95.\nCEVICHE!!!!", "author": "Meh M."}

Be careful eating here!  \nHere was my experience today: \nI ordered Ceviche 5 Elementos and the table next to us gave a very weird stare when they saw our food arrive.  We looked at their table and they had the same thing.  When the waitress walked away, we got the full scoop.  Apparently there were tiny little worms in their fish (that is compacted into a round mound) and they were waiting to speak to the manager.  She came by apologizing and said the chef would come by to explain how that happened.  He came and said that because they get really fresh fish, there is a chance this could happen but it is very rare and has never happened to them before.  Ewww.....We could barely swallow.  The manager noticed we had the same plate and we told her we no longer wanted it.  Then later when she came by to speak to us about how sorry she was about the whole incident, we told her to pull the plate from the menu.  And get this....she refused!  She said it was their most popular dish and she wasn't going to pull it.  Jeez, the least she could have done was reassured us that she was keeping the customer's health and satisfaction in mind.  Nope, she was focused on just the dinero!  And the worse part was 2minutes later we saw them serving that same dish to another table!!!!  \nI was completely shocked.  We left and will never return.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-08-26", "description": "This review is solely for my experience tonight.\n\nI have visited Fresca at it's Noe Valley location three times now. And I have even visited the West Portal location once (the food was not as good). I do appreciate they have a kids menu though.\n\nEvery time I've been to Fresca, I've been more and more disappointed. The first time I went there was about 3 years ago and I was delighted with everything. The food seemed fresh, there were huge portions, and the service was with a smile. And every other time it's been good, although never as good as the first one (I will make no cheesy references to relationships here).\n\nTonight's experience was by far the worst. I arrived at Fresca with my parents at 7:15pm in time for the reservations that my sister had made. They told us they couldn't seat us until the entire party was there. That's fine, I understand, although I understand less when the restaurant is deserted. \n\nFinally we are seated and 5 adults, one child (3 years old) and newborn are seated at the large booth in the back. The waitress greeted us with an air of snobbery and condescending tone in her speech. It looked like she had to make extra effort simply to put a smile on her face. Already, red flags.\n\nAmong the five adults, we ordered the halibut, the ahi mignon, the mahi-mahi, the lamb shank, and the paella. I then ordered a lemonade and again with that sick smile, the waitress asked, \"Do you want the machine lemonade or the fresh?\" I said, \"The fresh, please.\" And she replied, \"But you get free refills with the machine lemonade.\" That kind of made me pause. Did you make this comment because you think I want the free refills or am cheap and can't afford to pay for the fresh lemonade refills because I was wearing Converse? I was a little bit confused but reiterated that I wanted the fresh lemonade. Come on lady, I'm aiming for quality here.\n\nThe appetizers were OK, we had the ceviche mixto and the Fried Calamari. The Calamari was disappointingly lukewarm and somewhat flavorless. Then the plate stayed on the table. FOR THE WHOLE MEAL.\n\nNext we waited for our entrees. And waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nI looked around the restaurant. Four other tables at most. Glanced back at the kitchen. Was about to flag down the ever friendly waitress when she appeared with the dishes. They placed all plates in the wrong places and although this is forgivable, they just seemed like they didn't care. My rice was lukewarm. I believe I was so annoyed with the service that it made my food taste a lot worse than it actually was.\n\nAlso, would it kill a busboy to smile?\n\nI think the waitress checked up on us once during the meal and that was almost immediately afterward. Didn't see her again until we had to yet again flag her down to clear the plates. She didn't ask if we wanted dessert but brought menus. At this point I was ready to get out of there but everyone wanted flan so that's what we got. When the bill came, we noticed she had tacked on the 18% gratuity because of our party of \"6,\" which seemed a little bit weird to me since my niece is 3. She probably knew that she wouldn't have gotten larger than a 10% tip if she hadn't. She obviously just did not give a shit. On the way out, she was standing at the bar and I know she saw us exit. She did not say \"thank you\" to any of us, not even my dad who spent over $200. I did notice that she said goodbye to my bro-in-law (who is Caucasian... I'm just saying!) but maybe it was just because he was the last of the party. The whole experience was such a bummer especially because I felt that we were extremely polite.\n\nThe dinner club and I have been frequenting quite a few restaurants in the City and I can understand some of the snobbery found during these fine dining excursions. With Fresca, I really cannot understand it; what's the point in snobbery here?\n\nI just want to end this by saying that I've worked in food service before and thus tend to give people a lot of wiggle room. The fact that I was completely disgusted with the service illustrates that I was terribly disappointed. Perhaps it was an \"off\" night but it was so off that I don't plan on returning.", "author": "Salina Z."}

Fries or salad come with your sandwich. The fries were pretty good, and the salad ok.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-12-30", "description": "I am a pretty forgiving person and usually always give someone a second chance. So when my friend Robert invited me out to lunch at the Fresca in Noe Valley, I gave it a go despite my negative experience at the Fillmore stree location several years back. I mean, they are owned by different people so how bad could it be? The food at Fresca is pretty good. It's always the service that is really poor for some reason.  The first time I went to the Fresca on Fillmore, I ordered a ceviche dish.  When the order came, I was pretty convinced it wasn't what I had ordered but was assured by our server that it was the correct one. When the bill came, we realized that the server had flat out LIED to us and then charged us for the more expensive dish that we hadn't ordered even though he told us it was the original dish we had requested. He didn't really do much to fix the situation except to tell us that we could take the 15 dollar dish out of his tip which would have been somewhere around 30 bucks.  As if we even wanted to leave a tip at all!\n\nThen last week when we went to Fresca in Noe, I had hoped for a much different experience only to be let down. We were seated fairly quickly but then ignored for about 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us if we wanted something to drink. We also placed our orders during this time and proceeded to wait about 25 minutes for our food to come. It was clear that they were not prepared for the lunch rush, but good communication goes a long way. Since we were seated right by the kitchen, I watched as the waitress stood there doing nothing except wiping down plates over and over again that should have been going out to tables.  If you can't time your food correctly, you should at least serve it while it's hot. When our food came, the fries were COLD and when they were sent back, the plate came back a minute later--clearly put under the broiler for three seconds and was merely lukewarm.  My pulled chicken stew with hardboiled eggs was also lukewarm and had pieces of eggshell in it.  For 14 dollars a plate, you had better learn how to peel an egg! I mentioned it to the server and he ended up comping the plate, but it still left a very bad taste in my mouth.  Despite the food being good when it's served hot, I just don't have it in me to ever go back to this place no matter what location it is.", "author": "Jade L."}

A strong pisco sour ( margarita-like drink made with pisco, fresh key lime juice and frothed egg white on top). Yummy classic ceviche (served with the requisite sweet potato and corn), lomo saltado (steak stir fry-like dish with peppers) and aji de gallina (shredded chicken in a spicy, creamy aji pepper sauce). The alfajores (shortbread-like cookies sandwiched together and filled with dulce de leche/caramel)  were only ok--a little too big/thick for our taste. Mini alfajores are the bomb.\n\nFresca also serves random pan-Latin food, all of which looked good too, but little of which I've tried there. I've spent a lot of time in Peru and that was more my focus. \n\nIn terms of Peruvian food, I think Fresca way outshines Limon, which is supposed to be more of the \"gourmet\" favorite in the city. But last time I visited Limon they didn't serve pisco sours, which is almost unforgivable in a peruvian restaurant, and I also got sick afterwards. \n\nHappy, I really enjoyed Fresca and I'd go back again!

As peruvian food, it's SO FRICKEN OVERPRICED, it's ridiculous.  a plate of 3 complex carbs and two proteins (standard andean fare) should not cost $25, people.  and too crowded, noisy, and sorry, it has the stench of a chain (yes, i know there are only a few, but a chain is a chain.)  this is not fine dining.  a t.v. was on.  the waitresses bus the tables.  NOT THAT I CARE, but that's not fine dining.  so why fine dining prices?  is it because they give you too much food?  maybe - because they do.  \n\nmy mother was visiting (we are Bolivian, and we know from Peruvian food) and she ordered the chuletitas de cordero - FOUR fat frenched lamb chops.  we convinced her to order them medium (she was about to do the old people thing and order them well done, ruining a perfectly good little lamb) when they should have been medium rare, but they were HEAVEN.  by far the best thing i had there that night.  really tender, juicy, flavorful.  i coulda had 6 of them and nothing else and been happy.  they were served with a ton of other things:  a minty chimichurri, yum; a quinoa tabbouleh, yum; garlic mashed potatoes, yum;  something else, maybe, i forget.  all good but too much food.   do you get the fact that it was too much food?  and pricey?  $28.  too much money in that it's just too much money for this kind of restaurant. but yes, you get a lot of food (remember the theme of this review?), so you could share, or you have leftovers, and therefore, two meals, so then it's not so expensive.  \n\nmy other favorite thing there was the causa (a cold mashed potato layered appetizer), served here with ahi tuna.  excellent textures, flavorful, pretty - a perfect dish. ok, i'd probably come back here just for this.  a total stand-out. and NOT too much food. and i can't remember how much but maybe not too much money.\n\nmy sister and i both ordered the churrasco - $25 each - which turned out to be TWO steaks each!  caa-razy!  both very flavorful, tender ribeye steaks.  served with plantains (dry), white rice (my sister LOVED her rice, said it was soooo buttery, and garlicky but not overly so.  i liked it just fine.)  where they screwed up this dish is that it came with a fried egg on top of the rice, and they had obviously let it sit under a heat lamp too long (our entrees took WAAAAAAY too long - like 25 minutes after we finished appetizers, tho the waitress was very nice and apologetic about it.)  the egg is supposed to be crispy at the edges, yet soft enough to mix into the rice (by the way, for all you non-latins, A FRIED EGG, OVER-EASY OR OVER-MEDIUM, ON TOP OF RICE, IS THE BEST MEAL THERE IS.  with hot sauce or not.  salt and pepper, maybe some butter.  try it. it's the perfect dinner.) this egg looked like one of those plastic fake eggs they have on displays of bowls of the fake sushi in restaurant windows in Japan Town - a little rubbery puck.  we immediately said uh, no, nuh-uh, called the waitress and told her.  she apologized profusely, took JUST the eggs back (good girl!), and came back very quickly with two perfectly tender buttery fried eggs.  dee-liteful.  our meals also came with french fries, and i found them cold, but cold like they'd sat under a heat lamp, and not that good. of course i ate every last one of them - i never leave behind fries - who knows?  they could be the last fries you'll ever eat.  my sister liked them.   again, a TON of food, neither of us could finish.  my bf got a ton of leftovers.\n\noh, we also split, the 3 of us, a GI-NORMOUS cesar salad.  very good, refreshing, with croutons and candied walnuts - i wished it would have been a tad more garlicky but it was good.\n\nwe didn't try any of the ceviches, which i know i should have, but thank god we didn't, would have been that much more food and the bill would have been well over the $150 we spent (i'm the only one who had wine, and only one glass at that.)  \n\nnow, you may not think $150 is too much for 3 people to eat, and to eat what i've reiterated over and over was an over-abundance of food. but it's PERUVIAN FOOD.  the INCAS.  it's poor people food, andean indian food.  it's NOT FANCY.  it shouldn't cost this much.  it just shouldn't.  it's like Pizarro and Atahualpa, all over again.", "author": "maria a."}

The lamb had this flavorful crust, while the meat itself was tender and moist...easily became my favorite dish at Fresca. \nMy second visit was almost equally the same.. I took another friend of mine (who happens to be Peruvian). She's been to one at a different location. This time, the ceviche was just right (I shared one dish). I decided to try something new for my main course -the churrasco (filet mignon). Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed..it wasn't as flavorful and tender as the Cordero. I should've ordered the lamb, but hey, at least I know about the steak now. \n\nAtmosphere is nice, during my first visit, we sat at the bar, I found it difficult looking away at our hot waitress's cleavage.. and probably because of that, I ended up taking the waitress's suggestion of buying a drink.. I got this basil mojito.. which was actually pretty good. Even good enough for my companion who took a few sips off min -she claims to be allergic to alcohol. \n\nI'm not sure of the other locations but I must mention that it can get noisy here (if it bothers you). Fresca at Noe Valley have flat panel TVs mounted around the place so it can get pretty noisy especially since they're tuned to sports events", "author": "Josh G."}

From the ceviches (which i was born to adore-- such that even after trio appetizer, i took another wistful stab @ entree), sodium seemed confused for spicing. The traditional preservative is lime juice, not a mineral ending in chloride! It dusted everythin'-- down to the platano chips, which since our trip to nicaragua I've a hankering for. I actually woke multiple times in the night as though i'd dined in Shanghai (now THAT is a salt excursion unparalleled), wondering if my mouth was being reincarnated as an umbeshi plum.

It is overpriced, but if you pick the right things you will be very happy with your meal. I would highly recommend the Pan con Lomito, a traditional Peruvian meal of tomato and steak on a sandwich. Their Aji de Gaillina is also very tasty, but very filling and heavy. And of course, the ceviche is delicious. Don't waste your time with the cesar salad, you can get a better version of that somewhere else. Instead, try the Toro steak salad, which comes with a house cilantro dressing that's very impressive. As I said before, go for lunch and not dinner, when you'll pay less for the same quality.", "author": "Isabel C."}

All of the staff was extremely accomodating--from the efficient bartender to the host of waitstaff. They got it that we were there for a cozy birthday dinner and put us on an end table so we wouldn't be flanked by folks. The menu has all of the favs from the other locations (peruvian cesar salad, the rice and chicken stew) as well as some new additions like an amazing Kobe beef carpaccio with horshradish sauce. My Neiman Ranch steak was pretty fatty, but the sauted spinach was perfect.

The underlying theme of most of these reviews is \"good food, bad service.\" Huh? I've eaten at Fresca in Noe Valley 10 times at least and have had consistently good, sometimes great, service. What gives? Surely they can't just be picking me out to receive the good service and everyone else gets a sucky waiter. I think you guys are being a bit harsh (except you with the rock in your mussels - that sucks). The food here is always great and I think the bartenders make exceptional drinks. There are some downers - the long wait for a table if you have no reservation and the level of noise when its busy. Hey, that just means they're successful. And as for the whole \"its too much like a chain - it might as well be in San Mateo.\" That's just typical SF food snobbery. Anything that is that successful AND has more than 2 locations is a ploy by \"The Man\" to destroy all that is good and holy about SF food culture - oh, please.\nI digress. Anyway, give it a shot again you guys. If you still think the service sucks, post again. I'd be interested to know if any of you have different experiences. Cheers.", "author": "Jamie M."}

The beans were pinto, which I'm usually not a fan of, but they were full of flavor.  We also had a carafe of sangria, which ended up being four very full glasses of good sangria. The bread basket comes with an olive tapenade dipping sauce, which was a nice touch.\nWe paid cash, and they didn't have change, so we couldn't even leave a decent tip.  It was really weird.

When we walked by Fresca, I noticed the prices were a little more than I wanted to pay, considering I'm recently unemployed, but it is funemployment, right? Why not splurge every now and again... \nAgain...I say wow! \nFirst off, the salad with crab, etc. Yum! Perfect for two! I'm a salad lover and this really hit the spot. \nNext up--the scallops with plantains and quinoa and other things that complimented one another perfectly. \nThen came the ceviche! We ordered the 5 elementos version. There's nothing more to say ... Perfection! And spicy too. Caroline said she didn't recall the ceviche being quite to spicy, but the little extras that came with it (butter lettuce, yams and scrumptious corn) really complimented every bite. We were fighting over who would get the last little scoop. \nDessert....Ok, well I have to tell you, I RARELY get dessert. I'm just more of a savory type of eater. When Caroline asked for the dessert menu and I noticed how inexpensive each dessert was (~$7 each) , I thought why not. \nOh my...heaven! And I believe we didn't say a word to each other the whole time we ate our desserts. I got the shortbread cookies with dulce de leche and Caroline got the chocolate cake thingy. I have to say the couple of bites she offered were way better than I expected. You see, chocolate desserts in a restaurant are often too rich for my taste. But no, perfection once again. It didn't top my cookies, however. \nI left stuffed and smiling. \n\nAll in all...amazing! Fresa, I'll be back for more to try the rest of your menu-after I get a freakin' job, that is.

Now, it was Saturday afternoon, and you would think, too late for  brunch. However, this place still had a sign on the sidewalk, advertising chocolate chip pancakes and bottomless mimosas. It was the chocolate that drew us in, but after we realized that was for the kids menu, it didn't matter, because there was sooo much else for us to eat. I looked at it and thought wow every single thing looks yummy. The bread with the olive dip they gave us was yummy and I don't even like olives. S had a salad which he liked, and j had a red clam chowder, which had shrimps and other things in it. I tried that and mmmm! As an appetizer, that could have been a full lunch. The ceviche was only ok. This was my fourth ceviche I've ever had, and it was my least favorite. It was too meaty and heavy and none of us was impressed. Not that it was bad, but it just wasn't up to par. For my food I had a blue crab omlette, which had cream cheese and avocado and all sorts of yum in it. By this time, from the bread and ceviche I wasn't too hungry so I couldn't finish the home fries, but they were good, as well as the fruit side. J had trout, which he thought was small for normal, but given that he'd eaten that whole soup, bread, ceviche... it was enough. That came with a side of home fries and fruit too. S had mahi mahi sandwich with a side of fries. He could only take a few bites but I tried it the next day and it was still good, so it must have been yum when fresh. We all had the bottomless mimosas. They were strong and at the same time very tasty. Only, they were SLOW. Mimosas put me to sleep so I sipped mine slowly. The guys finished theirs first, and no refills. By the time I'd finished MINE I know they were slow. We kept asking and asking it was forever before we got our second glasses. At the very end they started filling them up before we were done but the first half of our meal it was hard to get a glass. That was the only fluke in our meal though, and can say I loved the place, and cant wait to go back! Id go for brunch, lunch or dinner, everything looks so good!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-29", "description": "Where to begin? Usually when I review a place I want to add something to the discussion. Granted, everyone has their own personal likes and dislikes. Some people love bland  Mexican style and greasy sweet \"Chinese-American.\" Many people hate authentic ethnic food because it's too spicy or not spicy enough or whatever. Some people even like TGIF which is a perfectly disgusting chain. What do I like? Well, I like food that uses authentic ingredients, isn't overwhelming, and shows some creativity. I always give extra credit for that. FRESCA in Noe Valley is one of those places. There are other \"Fresca\" branches but I haven't been to them so this review will be for Noe Valley which I've been to four times now. I'll have to pass on a comment on authenticity as I have no idea what makes Peruvian food stand out from other Latin American cuisines. However, I will say that Peruvian friends have said that it was good and it was authentic. Our usual visits are for Sunday brunch (since it's the only time we can find parking in the neighborhood) so I can't judge much besides the brunch menu. We had a cerviche of stuffed potatoes (papa rellena) which just hit the spot. For entrees I had \"Peruvian\" Frittata which is an omelette with sirloin steak strips, onions, cilantro mushrooms, spinach, jack cheese and roasted potatoes. My daughter had the lomo saltado (seems to be a yelper favorite) which was almost like my omellete but without the eggs and with rice and french fries. It was more than enough. In fact any one of our meals could have been shared by two. The food was tasty with enough tang to make it interesting but not leave a taste in your mouth. On the side, we each had \"bottomless\" mimosas for $12. I noticed on the other table they were all sharing their entrees which included a paella -- one of these days I gotta try that since a good paella is hard to find. We didn't have any dessert this time. The wine list was ample and had a good variety of European, South American and West Coast wines. The waiter was attentive enough , kept our mimosas and water filled, and was not too intrusive. Overall, I'd say it was a good meal and we'll definitely be back.", "author": "Robert H."}

It's pricier than Savor, Toast, Fattoush, Chloe's, but we find it a real treat.  We now have a favorite waiter that seems to come with our favorite table, he helps me remember the name of my favorite dish (Arroz con Mariscos might be the surviving relative of my dish), a seafood stew that is heart-stoppingly wonderful.  My wife had a bad service experience one lunch, when the place was empty.  Lots of attitude and delay that kept us out for about a year. There can be little bursts of attitude that detract from the five-star-ishness, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  If you get some crap attitude, get up and leave, there are a dozen great places within a block, come back another time.

When I lived in the city during the dot-com boom in the late 90s, I used to go to Noe Valley a lot so know the neighborhood well. This restaurant, however, is new since I lived there (moved in 2000).  We liked the decor, the menu and the food we saw on patron's plates, so we took a chance.  We had our 13-month old son with us, and the staff didn't mind us bringing him in -- a big plus right there (but we came in for a late lunch/early dinner -- don't think we would have brought him in during prime evening dinner hours).  I had the paella and the portion was large and lots of sea food -- very tasty. Paired this with some sangria and I was set. It's been a while and can't remember what my wife and the rest of our party ordered, but we all seemed to enjoy our food equally well.  I'd come back here, but since there are many good restaurants in San Francisco, next time we're back for a vacation we'll try some others....for you locals reading this, Fresca is definitely worth a try.", "author": "Brendon M."}

But I'm too tired to make any suggestions myself. Ok fine.\". \n\nBut then we were seated at the bar where we could ogle the oysters and lobsters and the other patrons' plates and the wine and all that... and were served some deliiiicous ceviche! We got a tasting of three and they were to die for. I couldn't have enough of the yummy tuna with avocado, ponzu sauce, and wonton chips! Sadly, we had soon finished our plate. :( Fortunately, there was more awesomeness ahead! I don't know if bouillabaisse reduction is particularly Peruvian, but it should be and fortunately Fresca has realized this. I was in love with the ceviche but I could have married my entree, the dorado, on the spot.\nBeing all stuffed, it could have ended there but after a really good dinner, at least looking at the dessert menu can't hurt, can it...? And that's when the lava cake turned me into a trigamist. Just the right amount of chocolatiness with some melted chocolate inside... oh wow.\nBe sure to check out the \"interesting\" section on the wine menu! I was really too tired to have any wine, but I'm happy I fell for the interesting menu after all. Oh so good, and perfect with the ceviche and the fish.\n\nOh and btw, of course I was wrong about them serving Mexican food.", "author": "Lina M."}

Finally, I got seated and I opened my menu and, VOILA, nothing. So, I sent the menu back and never got a new one. A waitress never came. So, I heaved myself out of my comfy chair and went up to the podium and got a new menu myself.\n\nSigh.\n\nBut it gets better....(not being sarcastic).

The service was friendly enough when I went for dinner the other night with a friend: they cheerily offered vegan options not on menu for my frined & provided water with no ice after 3 requests. They also efficiently reheated my friend's entre when it arrived cold. I should have returned mine too as it was similarly lukewarm but I didn't want to appear to be a \"me-too\" and besides, the temperature was the least of its problems. It was possibly the worst paella I'ver ever been served: dry & bland. I'm one of those people who like to order things I can't easily make at home and seafood paella is one these dishes. Who has the appropriate mix of fish & prawns & shellfish on hand and the time to cook it slowly with just the right mix of herbs & spices to create a sumptuous serving ?

Crab cakes were AWESOME, some of the best crab cakes i've had in SF, wonderful texture and real great flavor.  Two of the 3 ceviches were great, we had one with shrimp and one with ahi, both fantastic.  The black ceviche was ok.  FOr two of us, they served both dishes at the same time, which seemed odd as one was warm and one was cold.  It would have been nice to finish the cold first and then been served the hot dish, but oh well, I am used to waiters in SF not knowing the ABC's of service so no biggie.\n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered the paella and the lamb shank.  The paelle was excellent, very nice flavor, spicy but not overpowering.  The mashed potatoes on the lamb shank dish were fantastic, as was the sauce, but the meat was a bit too overseasoned, maybe a little too much salt.  The portions were very generous.\n\nAfter out meal, the server dropped off our check without so much as asking if we wanted dessert, which we did.  I asked her if we could see a dessert menu, and she responded that the ktichen was closed.  Odd.  When I go to a restaurant and get sat before they close, I expect to be served all courses, especially if you are dropping 100 bucks for a meal.

It has a modern look, with nice paintings and mirrors on the wall. We came for lunch on a Friday around 1 and the place was relatively quiet. They first brought us some bread, which was challah-like twists with pepper flakes. My friends ordered an appetizer of mussels and chorizo in a tomato sauce. I tried some of the sauce (since I don't eat mussels) and it tasted a bit of bacon but the tomatoes were good. We also ordered pisco sours which were amazing. The drink was frothy on the top with a bit of red bitter. I highly recommend the pisco sour. For lunch I ordered a traditional peruvian dish called aji de gallina which is a chicken strew made with pulled chicken, evaporated milk, bread, and yellow chili. It was served with white rice and pea sprouts along side with roasted potatoes, hard boiled eggs, and sprinkled with roasted walnuts. The stew was very creamy, rich, and slightly spicy. I thought it was very good. My friends ordered the lamb, and apparently that was very good too (I don't eat lamb so I can't say for myself). The presentation of the food was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-04", "description": "Have been wanting to eat at Fresca for the longest time, and I finally ate here for lunch on Sunday since I was in the neighborhood (a friend is moving in a quarter mile away in Diamond Heights). Apparently packed in the evenings, it was somewhat empty at 1PM, though it did get a little more crowded by 2PM. Lunch is served through 3PM. This Fresca is the 3rd and newest one to open, formerly Tien Fu, a Chinese restaurant, first owned by the Calvo Perez family in 1996. Chef Julio Calvo Perez overseas the food here, while his son Jose oversees the Fillmore location, and Julio and his wife Zoila oversee the original West Portal location. When you enter, you will see a vaulted barrel ceiling, an exhibition kitchen, and two bars, one for drinks, and the other with over 8 preparations of their famed ceviche. Service can be sketchy and harried when they're busy, but my friend and I had fine service from a waitress who looked like Rachel Weisz. The maitre d' is pretty cute too. There's a specials board, so be sure to read it so that you don't miss the tiraditos, Peruvian-style sashimi. Be sure and try their balsamic strawberry margarita [strawberries and balsamic vinegar with Commemorativo tequila (gold anejo of 51% agave), sweet n sour (a mix of lemon juice, the juice of green lemons, sugar and sometimes egg white), and Peruvian pink sea salt (harvested from terraced ponds in the Andes mountains)]; it was quite yummy. My friend had a Pisco sour (Pisco is a Peruvian brandy made from the distillation of muscat grapes, grown near the city of Pisco), which was also quite nice. I quite liked the complimentary biscuits brought to our table. For our appetizer, we had the ceviche \"5 elementos\", $10: the traditional Peruvian ceviche of halibut, lime juice, red onion, sea salt, and Rocoto (a medium-sized round pepper common in Peru and Bolivia) aji (Peruvian chili sauce); it also came with a garnish of lettuce, a tiny piece of corn on the cob, a piece of yam, and Peruvian cancha (large, individually roasted kernels of corn). It was so very good. I had a hard time deciding on which ceviche to order. At dinnertime there is a seviche sampler, so I recommend that one. At lunch there are 6 ceviches available, and 4 (though not all the same as on the lunch menu) are available for lunch take-out. For our main entrees, we both ordered bocadillos (Spanish for little sandwiches, the term can also refer to snacks or finger foods), which come with a choice of French fries or green salad. I had a green salad with my Pan con Lomito (meat from the back of the cow), $8, $8.50 for take-out: sirloin steak strips wok-fried with onions and tomatoes, cilantro aioli, and Jack cheese on Dutch crunch bread. I cannot tell you how good it tasted. And a pretty sizable portion as well. It was filled with flavor, oozing its juices onto my plate. My friend had the Pollo Criollo (Peruvian Creole style cooking): sauteed chicken breast and onions smothered with Peruvian Creole mustard sauce, Jack cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes on toasted Dutch crunch, also $8. My friend loved this sandwich. The rest of the menu looked very good, and I definitely want to come back and try the rest of it. We noticed a lot of people ordering the Arroz con Mariscos: Peruvian paella with aji panca (One of the most common chile peppers in Peru) and cilantro rice spiced with cumin, calamari, clams, mussels, scallops, fish, prawns, sweet peppers and green peas, $14, $19 for take-out. For dessert, I had the Arroz con Leche Canelon: a chilled rice pudding stuffed mango \"cannelloni\", red fruits (strawberry), crispy rice candy, mango sorbet, and a sensuous honey gelee on the side. This was quite good and I could've eaten a 2nd serving of it, but perhaps it's for the best, as moderation is wise. It can be loud in the evenings, but the noise level was very low during our lunch. I even recognized a song, Decide-Toi by Rouge Rouge, found on the W Hotels Warmth of Cool Overture cd. I'll definitely be back to try the sangria, the croquetas de cangrejo, the chupe de mariscos, the other ceviches, the tiraditos, the Kobe beef carpaccio, the aji de gallina, the adobo de chancho, the cordero mar y tierra, the pulled pork bocadillo, the causa maki, the rack of lamb, the rotisserie chicken, the lime catalan creme brulee, the alfajores, the flan, and the Carlos premier brandy.", "author": "Hao L."}

Stepping into Fresca's warm confines with a broad brush of Latin flavor and Saturday night crowd in full tilt, I was in instantly in the mood for a long dinner with some friends from years' past. After a reasonable wait, we were seated at a fine table along the wall near the ceviche bar. So far so good.\n\nFriendly waiter with a native Spanish-speaking accent? Still good.\n\nThe table ordered up a couple rounds of tuna tartare and white tuna ceviche, which were delightfully sauced and gone instantaneously. Love the concept here of a full ceviche bar and appetizer menu. Paired up with a pitch of sangria that can stack up with any, and we're off to a perfect start. Unfortunately I didn't realize until later that a couple of my B-league friends would nurse their sangrias until past dinner and that first glass would be my last.\n\nHowever the culinary fun ends here. I took about 10 seconds to decide on an entree as the words \"sea bass\" sealed the deal quickly at the top of page 2 of the menu. My yelp-tastic table neighbor went with the yelper-recommended lomo saltado. Both disappointed. The sea bass was unspeakably dry in some areas and over-salted. Sea bass needs nothing but a decent flame and a pinch of salt and the rest takes care of itself. How they messed this up was puzzling. A few glances to Bobby Flay-wannabe chef trying to lick the ceiling repeatedly with pan flames may have been the answer. Would have liked to sent the dish back, but it was decently moist in other areas and we had waited a Long Time to get our entrees. \nI'm not a one-dish yelper (OK fine, not really a yelper period on review #2 here), so I decided to partake in my neighbor's lomo saltado. At first sight, I was like WTF are rice AND fries doing with a main of wok-fried steak? Second, this looked like a plate I could get in Little Saigon or Clement St. for 1/4 the price. Including the ingredients here for good measure:  wok fried tenderloin steak strips, onion, tomato, cilantro, soy, french fries, steamed rice. Sounds more like your local Vietnamese lunch than a crowd-pleaser at a Peruvian dinner, no? Oh and it was kind of Dry! Yes, like the sea bass. Yes, unspeakable.\n\nOK enough on that. Very disappointing main events when the lead-up was so promising and enjoyable. A big hole in the lineup when 1/3 of the entrees fail to deliver.\n\nThanks to the waiter for the accommodating long dinner. Chill guy, fine service. Gracias.", "author": "Al B."}

(Although, now that I think about it - it was sorta like that for dinner when we previously went). Our waiter was breathless, forgetful, frazzled, and unreliable. His bus boys weren't helping him out either. He took forever to get to us to take our orders, didn't give us straws when we asked for them, did not give us back our credit card for an extremely long time. I ordered a coffee and I had to ask 3 separate people for sugar before I finally got some (and waited like 10 minutes while my coffee got cold). \n\nWe also saw our food waiting on the counter for an incredibly long time, and he took it to another table, which was immediately returned since it was going to the wrong table...then it sat on the counter for even longer, until our waiter realized that it was supposed to come to us! Cold, mushy, lettuce soaked through, bread/fries no longer crunchy! And I ordered a regular chicken pesto sandwich which should have come with advocados and it didn't have any. The lady at the table next to me got the same thing and hers looked very yummy with plenty of advocado. I never asked for anything to be subtracted from the order!! But I was afraid to tell my waiter about this oversight and ask for advocado since he would probably forget it anyway and he never came by our table again!! My Bf's kobe sliders (also went to wrong table and then were brought over to us) were also entirely cold, greasy, and mushy. \n\nDefinitely not coming back for lunch again! \n\nIn this city where there are so many other great places in the city for food, why would you want to go back for a dining experience so hectic and unappetizing? The management should try to make sure they have enough staff on hand in the future if they want to keep customers.", "author": "E M."}

It was a very slow Sunday night yet the service was incredibly slow. The food was completely over salted. The ahi tuna tartar (cerviche chino) did not taste fresh and was so so salty we could not finish it. My friend and I also ordered the 5 elementos which was just ok. For my entree, I ordered the poached mahi mahi which was somewhat dry. Thank god it was swimming in what seemed like a Thai inspired coconut curry sauce. This restaurant is really overpriced for what it is. There really isn't much atmosphere which at least then I can understand the prices they're charging. For 2 of us without drinks, it was over 80 dollars. The overly salted food also kept me up all night running to the kitchen for water.  I would much rather go to Limon, or Limon Rostisserie next time we're craving cerviche.", "author": "michael k."}

The menu was filled with many interesting items, so my friend and I decided to eat family style.  We started with six of the seven ceviches.  I must say, the acid from the citrus was overwhelming.  Of the six ceviches, most were sour or too spicy to be enjoyed.  Let just say we needed two baskets of bread just to balance out the taste.  On the a side note, the ahi tuna was the only one of the six that I would recommend.  We followed the ceviche with a lobster tail appetizer.  Forgot the name, but it was the surprise hit of the evening.  It was colorful, truly a work of art; I told my friend that I wasn't sure if I should appreciate the work or eat it.  The last dish was a seafood bowl.  The taste was decent and the clams and mussels were delicious.  However, the fish was overcooked that it tasted more like chicken.

There was a guest chef who went around offering free shooters jelly. The waiter was attentive in the begininng. \n\nThen came our first course. I had Shrimp \"a la piedra\" which was very nice - right amount of heat. My companion had Ceviche Mixto which was unfortunately inedible because it was wayyyyy too sour. That was not our first time with ceviche so we were displeased when the waiter told us that \"ceviche has to be sour\". Yeahhh right...\nAnyway... after first course, the restaurant got busy and we could see our waiter were rushed to wait other tables. We waited a good 30 minutes between our first course and 2nd... Our main dishes were Churassco and Sudado. I loved my Sudado - the flavor of the broth was very nice (coconuty, limey) - right amount of everything. Unfortunately for the mahi-mahi, it was way overcooked. \nMy companion's Churassco had a nice flavor of it - however the meat was too chewy although we requested medium rare. The rice and grilled asparagus were boring. \nMoving on to the last course - Lava de Chocolate was just okay. There was nothing special about it. The ice cream that came with the chocolate had no flavor so unable to tell what it was. Tres Leches was disappointing. Could not taste the three milk and the ice cream was more of caramel than dulce de leche. The cake itself WAS NOT soaked in milk flavor as it is should be. It was more like hard sponge cake. We think the desserts totally missed it.\n\nAt the end of the night, we think that the food was disappointing and the service was not all that. The table next to us was charged for drinks that they did not have in their check - They actually had to speak to the manager about the error because the waiter insisted that they ordered it.\nTo top if off, I went home and went straight to the bathroom !!! Something that I ate just did not agree with me. It was probably the ceviche that was wayyyy too sour. Thanks to Fresca, I slept uncomfortably with stomach pain. \nGo to La Mar instead !", "author": "KQJoe S."}

So, we arrived exactly on time for our 7:00 pm reservation, but our table wasn't ready. The host told us it would be 5 or 10 minutes. We weren't in a huge hurry, so we didn't mind. But 10 minutes turned into a half hour. At this point, we were complaining so they gave us free beer/wine from the bar while we waited. There was nowhere to sit and wait, so we all stood right in front of the host, hoping he would remember we were there and seat us quicker. This strategy did not work. We waited for 50 MINUTES before we were seated! They were seating people who didn't have reservations before us. I don't think they were doing it to snub us, I just think they have no idea what they're doing. However, once we finally ate, the food was pretty delicious, especially the appetizers. I was a bit annoyed that they were out of the chicken entree I wanted to order. Drinks were strong and tasty (and at least we got a couple free ones out of them).

The atmosphere was great and so was the food and the service. Which is why I decided to go back for my mom's birthday. Well, in all honesty, I was extremely disappointed the second time around. The food was still good but the service was horrible. I was treated as though I was a bother and  as though I should be grateful to be asked what I wanted to drink. My waiter only changed his attitude because I told my aunt I was ready to talk to the manager and he probably overheard me. All in all, it's a great place that I really like but they should really work on their service. I read some of the other reviews and it seems to be a problem. That's quite a shame for such a popular restaurant to have such a reputation.", "author": "Anna T."}

My friend is from Peru, very high maintenance and he recommended it! We ordered just about everything. Service, food great. Unfortunately, they were out of the chocolate dessert we wanted. Next time because I will be back!", "author": "Beanie N."}

The restaraunt is a pleasant place to eat.  It has a modern, warm feel, and the service was good.  The food at Fresca, however, was not good.  \n\nWe ordered the Ceviche Costanera, which was the best part of the meal.  I don't really have a complaint about that dish.  The octopus and scallops were delicious, but overall the dish was mediocre.  Next, we had the Causitas; little balls of mashed (something similar to potato..yam, beans?) with various seafood toppings, sitting in a sauce.  It looked good enough but, once again had a mediocre impression once we ate it.  The texture was pretty much just mush, and the flavors blended a little too well together.  We knew the portion sizes were decent, by looking around the room before we ordered so, we shared an entree, the duck.  The meat was pulled apart and placed on top of what looked like a kind of risotto.  This dish was BAD.  It was so salty, I thought someone had an accident with the salt shaker while preparing it.  The server came by and asked how everything was.  I said to him, \"This dish is really realllly salty, is it suppose to be SALTY?\"  He replied, \"Oh...no,\"  and then walked away.  I don't know how he felt about that but, he did ask, and I'm telling you, it was damn salty!  My tongue hurt a little after that dish...\n\nWe paid a little over $80 including two glasses of chard, and tip.  Not bad BUT, on the check the restaraunt slipped in an extra fee!  Just under $3 for the San Francisco Healthcare Plan.  I dunno about that one...I might have felt fine about it if they mentioned it but, including it in on the bill without a mention?  Not cool, and deffinately not classy. \n\nI'm giving this restaraunt 2 stars for my first and possibly only visit.", "author": "b p."}

I want a table close to the window and we are two people and the guy with really bad attitude give as a table in the very back of the house. The server was good, food really tasty what for the host owner I don't want to go to Peru after that. This is not Spanish Tapas is Peruvian food with a very cocky asshole host with a bad mustache.", "author": "Jonathan R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-10-25", "description": "i have lived in noe valley for nearly two years and at first this restaurant quickly became one of my favorite places.  however, in the past few months the management switched hands and things have really gone downhill.  the service used to be better, the food portions (especially ceviche) used to be larger; the fish quality used to be a lot better, and the wine selection has been changing (for the worse, imo).  i have been going less frequently and each time with greater and greater dissatisfaction.  and then recently i discovered a website where you can check the health inspection scores of your favorite restaurants in san francisco.  out of curiousity i looked up the 24th st fresca only to find that their most recent inspection (on 9/7/07) scored them a scarily low score of 59!! which is down 31 points from the last inspection in may (was this before the new management?)  anyway, i'm done with this reastaurant until i see this score go back up, and then perhaps i'll try it again, but my advice to the new management is to check with the old team - whatever they were doing, it was a much better overall experience.", "author": "Cat T."}
