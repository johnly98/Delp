After looking up a couple of options, I settled on Per Diem. They require a credit card on file for parties of 6 or more, which was a bit annoying, but understandable. It's $20 per person for no shows or any other changes.\n\nSet up took longer than we had expected, so I called to change our reservation from 6pm to 7pm. They mentioned that there would be a small charge for this and any no-shows. That's fine, it was our bad.\n\nThe bar area is very loud, but tables on the upper level are very quiet and is a really great place to have a large group dinner.\n\nAppetizers were tasty - we split the burrata and fried carrots. We all had their mushroom pasta, which was phenomenal. Dessert was the apple cobbler and key lime pie. Everything tasted amazing and service was on point and attentive.\n\nI think I made an excellent choice and would not hesitate to pick Per Diem again.", "author": "Michelle T."}

The food was average...the pizza margarita look like it came from the microwave of a Stouffers Pizza however the surf and turf was on point. The meatballs had too much bread tonight. They do not make their dessert in house Which is why we opted for the salted caramel ice cream which by the way, was scrumptious.\n\nMy bone of contention was with the initial wait staff.. We had a blonde waitress finally check on us 25 minutes after we sat down. Please note we were seated at the front section of the restaurant. She took our order and apologized for the wine being late which took another 15 minutes to get to us. After about 45 minutes of not receiving our food order, I spoke to the host,  who I was pleasant,\n\nThe next thing I know, we have a brunette waitress come try table she did not apologize once for our food not even being here and she had the audacity to say that the other service person was off and \"she was not obligated to service us any longer\" since she was off the clock. \n\nIDGAF!!!! Am I obligated to pay the 4% health service charge for all San Francisco employees? Yes. therefore you are obligated to serve me and I don't care who services me but somebody better.\n\nListen, if the table next to us told you to check on us because they sat down after us and they received their food before us and we have not received our appetizer that should tell you something. \n\nI have been in the service industry for a long time. I understand if you are transitioning wait staff. There is a way to politely say, \" excuse me my shift is done please close out with me...so and so will be servicing you tonight.\" I would have gladly tipped you out and transfer the remaining balance of our meal to the new person. That never happened tonight and I'm highly disappointed. \n\nI have been here on three separate occasions and never once have experienced the abhorrent and disgusting service that I received tonight.\n\nBlondie, if your shift is done your shift is done. Trust me I get it. But do not leave your guests in the dark by not transferring over the tab to the new server and then proceed to socialize with the host for the next 45 minutes.

We work a long ass day and at the end of the day we want to be taken care of and we want to spend our money.\n\nthe bartender that waited on us and was very nice and we gave him a very generous tip because he deserved it and the bus boys did too!!! \n\n I hope these two wait people get a reprimand and learn their lesson., There are many restaurants in San Francisco where we could spend our hard earned money with and have 100% more enjoyable time with.", "author": "Cal K."}

I arrived first on Friday, May 25th a little after 4pm. No reservation as I don't think they take them for HH. Managed to find a small round table in the front by the window. One of the boys joined me shortly after and the other about an hour later.\n\nHappy Hour: served 4pm to 6pm\n*Glass of Wine - bartender's selection: sparkling, white, red ($8)\n*Bottle of Wine Special - bartender's selection: white, red ($30)\n*Standard & Pours: one shot, one beer ($9) x3\n\nI was by myself for a good 20 mins, so I just nursed a glass of HH bubbly. I never saw the bottle, but was told it was a prosecco. When one of the boys joined me, we took part in the wine bottle special. It was National Wine Day after all. The red bottle was Chronic Cellars Suite Petite, so I believe a petite sirah. When I found out the HH shot was a four roses (I think bourbon), I decided to take part. I think our server said the beer was a racer ipa. I just took a sip and pawned it off on the boys. (I'm not a huge beer person.)\n\n*Lobster Fries ($18)\n*Steamed Mussels: PEI mussels, garlic & white wine sauce, rustic toast ($13)\n*Rustic Meatballs: bellwether farms ricotta toast, san marzano tomato sauce, parmigiano, micro basil ($13)\n*Burrata Margarita Flatbread: tomato sauce, fresh basil, olive oil ($16)\n*Talisker 18 Year, Isle of Skye ($18) x2\n*Tomintoul 16 Year, Highland ($15)\n\nThey don't have HH food specials, so we just ordered from their Afternoon Delights menu since this was basically our dinner. I adored the lobster fries. Came topped with a good amount of lobster. And that sauce. So comforting and savory. The mussels were also good. Plump and tender. We all decided to end HH with a scotch whisky. I got the Talisker as I thought it was a good deal. $1 per year is typically a great deal when it's an 18 year, right?\n\nFun place for HH. I'd definitely come back for those fries and a bottle of wine.", "author": "Elena N."}

My date and I hung out at the bar while we waited for a table during busy dinner hours.  I ordered a well-made old fashioned and my date ordered the Falcon (which I cannot find on their current menu). The drinks and the friendly bartender entertained us while we waited. After about 15 minutes, the host called us over to let us know our table was ready and then quickly retracted her statement because she said that the party before us suddenly and inexplicably returned to our table. This was the first of a series of odd, innattentive occurences. For an appetizer, we ordered the barratta cheese with almonds, which was both delicious and sweet. \n\nFor the main dish, we ordered the roasted chicken, which was nicely done but I got a thigh instead of a breast.  I had to wait until I was almost finished with my meal in order to get my wine, which I had ordered at the same time as the main. When my Chardonnay finally arrived, it went well with the chicken and the vegetables, which include spring peas and artichoke hearts.  At this point the waitress must have gone off duty or something because I had to wait a while for the check. \n\nI would be interested in returning but have to say it will not be anytime soon.

It was the perfect atmosphere for what we were going for, a bit dressed up yet still casual. We were immediately seated at the high top tables in the bar area with no reservation. \n\nWe brought our own bottle from wine country and the corkage fee was $25. I had seen this restaurant on some list saying they didn't have a corkage fee, but I called ahead and asked so there were no surprises there. We ended up buying another bottle for $53.\n\nStarted off with the charcuterie and cheese appetizers. Good size to share the two between 4 people. The mustard served with the charcuterie had a big kick to it if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nWe all ordered different things for dinner. One steak and lobster, one strip steak, one mushroom pasta, and the squid ink linguine for myself. My vegetarian friend was still hungry after her meal. I want expecting the level of heat my linguine came with so I went easy on the noodles and ate all the seafood. The shrimp and scallops were enough to keep me satisfied.

We had to wait 20 minutes after our reservation to be seated, but got compensated appetizers as a \"sorry\" gesture. I'd say you shouldn't go here if you're in a hurry, but it's worth visiting otherwise! \n\nI called at 3pm yesterday to make a reservation for lunch today. No pick-up. I called again at 5:30, during their dinner hours, and still nobody picked up. I left a message asking to make the reservation, but I don't think it happened. Later that night I booked a reservation through OpenTable, but it only allowed booking in half-hour increments. No 12:45 lunch reservation for us I guess, so I just went with 1pm instead, for a party of 6. No issues, I got the confirmation email and thought we were set. \n\nCome the day of the reservation, we go in at 12:55 for our 1pm reservation. They had us in the reservation list and told us we'd be seated shortly. We checked with the hostesses again at 1:10 and they said the people at the table were still finishing up. (After walking through the restaurant to our table, it was clear that there wasn't a whole bunch of seating for groups of 6.) At 1:15 we asked to place our appetizer and entree orders so we wouldn't have to wait too long once we were seated, and the hostess took down all our orders while also comping us for the two appetizers we ordered, and even threw in an extra comped flatbread. $37 of appetizers comped, nice! Finally at 1:20 we were led to our table at the back of the 2nd floor, which also allowed us to see how cool the restaurant really is. It reminded me a little of Novela what with the walls covered in bookcases, but Per Diem took it a couple steps further with the decoration. It felt amazingly rustic and raw, and the mini outdoor patio on the 2nd floor added a ton of ambient light to the otherwise dark space. \n\nThe food was all really good. We ordered:\n- Hummus appetizer: flatbread cracker chips and hummus, along with lots of veggies on the plate. Pretty good, worth the $9 I think\n- Fried Rainbow carrot appetizer: deep fried carrots served with a yummy sauce: Good, but not a large enough portion to warrant the $12 I don't think\n- Margarita Flatbread - 6 pieces, about 9 inches by 6 inches. Delicious, and the cheese was particularly noteworthy as being something other than standard mozzarella. Worth the $16\n- Wild Mushroom Pasta - relatively small pasta dish served on a big plate, with a foamy sauce. Neat presentation and apparently really good, I'm really excited to pay the $19 to get this next time I come. \n- Broccoli De Cicco Flatbread - Looked good, with roasted broccoli on the top. Also $16\n- Bacon Flatbread - It was decent, but I think I would have preferred a second Margarita flatbread if I could do the order over. Also $16\n- Tri-Tip Sandwich - Served with fries, this sandwich came between huge toasted pieces of bread. It looked amazing!  $18\n- Flank Steak - Well seasoned and garnished, but relatively small (6-8oz maybe?) and with a side of potatoes, if I recall. $28\n\nAll in all the 30 minute wait in the entrance left us in a poor mood, but the comped appetizers and the good food / cool environment / attentive waitress and hostess made up for it. I would have given 4 stars if not for these issues, but until proven otherwise I'll assume the reservation situation is not up to par. \n\nPer Diem, please answer your phone (or at least call back), adjust OpenTable to allow for 15 minute chunks for reservations, and finally adjust the reservation quantity so you can better seat people on time!", "author": "John B."}

Walked in at 5 and weren't able to get a spot upstairs in the restaurant, so we opted for the happy hour downstairs.\n\nWe shared the burrata tartine, tempura artichoke hearts, and meatballs. The portion size was pretty decent, and the flavors were good, but not outstanding in any sort of way. Perhaps I prefer a creamier and saltier sort of buratta, and the toast was a bit too crispy for my liking (I'm more about the chew). The tempura artichoke hearts were fried well, but it felt lacking in actual artichoke heart and more about the fried bits-- we didn't finish this. The meatballs were pretty standard-- not good, not bad.\n\nThe interior itself was beautiful-- again, reminiscent of New York with dark wood paneling and a fancy but not glitzy sort of atmosphere. Happy hour downstairs was a bit loud (had to lean in a couple times to hear the person across from you) but I'd imagine it would be quieter upstairs. I'll plan to be back!\n\n--\n\nEdit: Been back twice but still didn't make it upstairs! They don't have any non-alcoholic drinks on the menu, and the ones that they mixed up for me were a bit lacking. I got the squid ink spaghetti tonight and while it came out pretty hot (always a plus), it lacked the umami flavor I crave in squid ink pastas, and was almost a bit sour from the tomato. The shrimps and scallops were perfectly cooked, with the shrimp being extra buttery. Portions are on the smaller side considering that I was able to finish my dish with room to spare. 3.5/5.

Complimentary bread was my husband's favorite (sourdough) even if too hard for my taste. We had the meatballs to start which were tasty but I kind of stayed wanting to try the avocado toast so I guess next time that'll be it. Husband chose the flank steak with potatoes (amazing!) and I had the mushroom pasta (a little underwhelming). I thought the pasta could've used something... just couldn't put my finger on what it was. Perhaps it was not warm enough when it reached me or needed a little salt; it was just okay.

BUT, that did not happen here! Although our waiter lacked enthusiasm, he memorized drink orders, appetizers, entree orders, and desserts! That was 5 start worthy in itself! \n\nThe most memorable appetizer to me was the Burrata Toast (toasted bread, burrata cheese, toasted almonds, and honey drizzle). Instantly love at first bite! The Charcuterie board had plenty of variety but wasn't the most stand-out dish. All main dishes were proportioned to the plate and the pasta sauces were intriguingly foamy and light. The squid ink linguini was light and I only wish I had more! The scallops were perfect and tasty. \nFor dessert, the apple tart with caramel ice cream was the best! It was flaky and not overbearingly sweet.

Location really great for anyone working/living in Financial District and can see why a lot of people would come here after work! There is an upstairs section as well with tables so you don't feel crammed.\n\nWe started off with the charcuterie & cheeseboard - presentation of this was really nice and the meats and cheeses were pretty good too. Nothing out of the ordinary, the only thing that would have bene nice is if the waiter pointed out the names for each.\n\nMain entrees we got the wild mushroom pasta, truffle mushroom flatbread, and the squid ink linguini. Out of the two pastas, I enjoyed the wild mushroom pasta more. There was a lot of hype around the squid ink pasta, but personally did not think it was anything extraordinary. Tasted like any other squid ink pasta you would get but a little lighter on the sauce (+1 if that's your thing!). As for the truffle mushroom flatbread, this was meh as well. I would definitely skip on this.\n\nAnd last but not least we got an order of the lobster fries, another thing that was hyped up. Unfortunately this was a bit of a letdown as well. Mainly a lot of cheese with not much lobster. Could probably buy the ingredients and make it myself at home.\n\nWorst part of this meal was that when we were ordering our waiter told us that we were ordering too much for our group and that we should probably take something off the list. I understand that he was just trying to help but let me be hungry and just take my money!! \n\n3.5 stars - would probably not come back again, but very convenient location for dinner after work if you are looking for a good atmosphere with decent food - just don't expect to be blown away.", "author": "Megan K."}

The bottom level is where the bar and lounge area is, upstairs are tables for dinner. The pricing for food and drinks weren't too bad, especially because the portions were generous.\n\nI started with a Teeling Peachy cocktail for $12 - Teeling Whisky, Combier P\u00eache, Lemon,\nSugar, Peach Bitters, Cremant Brut Ros\u00e9.

There wasn't enough toast for the amount of pate but we killed the rest using the table bread so that worked out fine.\n\nSquid Ink Linguini $26 - The squid ink pasta is house made, comes with 3 prawns and 2 large scallops in a lemon emulsion sauce. Such a simple dish yet packed with flavor! I loved it! \n\nMy friend ordered the Filet Mignon & Lobster Fries $36 - there's a lobster tail shell on top of a large basket of fries, but we came to the conclusion that there wasn't a whole lobster tail in the basket of fries, just small bits of lobster meat in the creamy sauce.

However, I didn't really think so. The linguini was good, but the butter/oil/sauce at the bottom made me question what it was. It almost looked like condensed water that the chefs forgot to take out before placing it in the bowl. Moreover, it was served at a lukewarm temperature and the seafood was a little too salty for my liking. Try it for yourself, maybe I just came on the chef's bad day. \n\nCroque Madame- probably the more \"bang for your buck\" option. This was actually quite good! The cheese was melted on top and a little toasted. The egg was able to get the runny-level that allowed the yolk to flow over the bread. The bread itself was crunchy too and you get two thick slices of it. \n\nOverall, this was a generally pleasant place but I probably wouldn't go here again any time soon. It's definitely a place that looks prettier than it tastes. Try somewhere else if you have a list of restaurants to try in SF. This can be at the middle-bottom of the list.", "author": "Sammy T."}

It is a nice to have when there's a large party and we need something to munch on.\n- corn soup (seasonal): loved this! There was a kick of spice to it, and the portion was super generous. I had an entire bowl to finish and it definitely made me full before my main meal. I would reorder this dish for sure!\n- smoked bacon flatbread: super tasty as well. We each got one slice and the flatbread had a crisp and was perfectly thin, so it wasn't over filling. The bacon and arugula was perfect. Would reorder again, too.\n- rustic meatballs: also worth ordering again because the meatballs were super tasty and tomato-y. The bread went well with the leftover cheesy sauce. Meatballs were soft enough and flavorful enough.\n- mussels and fries: super generous portion again with a full bowl of fries. I couldn't finish my fries, but the flavor of the garlic and sweet onions in the mussels sauce made me finish our entrees first! Super tasty and easy to eat with the little fork. Fries were perfectly tasty too. My coworkers ordered the same dish and loved it as well. They even tossed the fries in the remaining sauce because it was that tasty!\n- steak and fries: I got to try my coworker's and thought the steak was cooked a little too bland.

On a Thursday night, Happy Hour is in full swing, and the place was mobbed with 20-and 30-somethings. My friend and I decided to stay anyway. We got a nice enough table, but the noise level was through the roof. It died down some as the most narcissistic, self-indulgent, overtly loud, self-consciously ostentatious kids began to leave. This place is better at weekend lunch if you're a more...ahem...seasoned patron.\n\nNow for the food. We both had the salmon (I paired mine with a Daily Trader) and the fish was cooked to absolute and unassailable perfection. It came with grilled asparagus and asparagus puree. You know, asparagus is not one of my favorite vegetables. That said, my plate looked like it had just come out of the dishwasher by the time the waiter came to collect our plates. Ha ha ha. The DT was also delicious. I might have tried another cocktail, but I was with a friend who didn't drink, so I kept myself to the one.\n\nSo, if you're 40+ and have had that college-atmosphere energy out of your system for a couple of decades, you may prefer the weekend daytime. Or it's possible that other weeknights are tamer. Where you sit may also make a difference to the loud chatter, screaming, besotted bellows, etc., if you're there to catch up with a friend. Please know that, as far as the cuisine and drinks are concerned, you cannot go wrong.  No indeed!", "author": "L.E. W."}

We had a horrible day with some travel difficulties and were upset and discouraged and just wanted to find a wonderful meal which until this establishment, seemed impossible with all the restaurants in the SF area we tried during our stay that were (to say the least) average and disappointing.  We walked in late and were one of a very few people which was fine with us on this night.  This was more of a lounge look that we are not used to.  The woman that ended up serving us was very friendly and accommodating.  She misunderstood what I ordered and thought we wanted to share a steak and lobster meal but we did not want that and she was more than accommodating to make up for this error.  Let me tell you..... it was actually just enough for the two of us.  The Filet Mignon was done perfectly, the lobster was tender and melted in your mouth.  The presentation was lovely.  She offered a complimentary dessert which was unnecessary and much appreciated.  We ordered the key lime tart and the chocolate mousse desert and did not expect this to be comped which she did comp both.  These desserts were the best we had had in a very long time. We are from NYC and have dined at the best of the best and this out shined many of them.  It was just what we needed and made our night.  My only regret was that we found it literally right before we left or would have been back several more times during our stay.

Service was slow but friendly and the decor was fine, if a bit confusing at parts (we sat facing a raised, empty small room with tables and chairs). The menu is small and unappetizing. A good portion of the dishes seemed like cheap and simple offerings at inflated prices like hummus or avocado toast, which were fine at best, for dishes I could make with the current contents of my pantry for free. The hummus came with matzah crackers, which were pretty decent. Water and bread aren't available unless you ask, which is offputting. My friend ordered a drink with the opening round of drink orders and then no one was around to check on a refill for most of our time there so he had a total of two drinks the whole night instead of the 3-5 he typically orders. When they brought out the food, they put my side in front of my friend (easy mistake) and never brought my food. Whoever brought out the food either didn't notice the empty table in front of me or thought that was fine because when they had completed setting it all down they left without saying 'you're getting food too' or anything. We had to work out that they had forgot my entree order. I had the Brussels sprouts as a side which they graciously didn't forget, and they were bad. They had some mild char on them but they were just gross boiled Brussels sprouts, no culinary artistry or style, just boiled soggy sprouts with some bacon bits (which were good to be fair). They were disappointing. Speaking of disappointing, when they brought my entree, which arrived as they were clearing the plates from everyone else at the table, I was ready to eat, but when I tried the pasta I wished they had just forgotten it. The pasta tasted like dirty water. I dunno how else to put it. Wet, watery, some impurities, the slightest hint of egg, and nothing else. The mushrooms were fine, I ate all of them because they had flavor, but the pasta tasted as if it were merely wet noodles. I'm sure everyone has ups and downs but even giving them a lot more credit than I feel they deserve results in a quintessentially underwhelming experience. Sorry Per Diem. One thing I will say is that their prices seem pretty reasonable, most of the entrees topped out at under 30 dollars, but I'd rather spend 36 dollars on a 20 dollar pasta than spend 20 dollars for dirty water pasta.

Refreshing and tasty, I recommend it!\n\nAppetizers included the holy moly delicious fresh burrata on thin toasted bread, drizzled with honey and almonds.  It was a tasty pillow of fabuloso in my mouth.  The mussels were good but soooo tiny and such a small portion, I would not recommend it.  Not worth for the price.\n\nFor the main entree, I ordered the beef short rib tagliatelle with roasted red bell peppers.  This dish was absolutely melt in your mouth fantastic.  The sauce was perfect, not too salty and savory enough to keep you wanting more.  I also had a small taste of my friend's flat bread (with arugula and cheese, yum!).  The other friend ordered pork chops.  It looked moist and perfectly cooked.  I did not try any because of my pork allergy.\n\nWe were there for 2 hours, eating, laughing, bonding over boy troubles and life troubles.  Drowning our sorrows in delicious cocktails and carb heaven.  This is definitely a place I would return to.  Good work, Per Diem.", "author": "Yue L."}

We were slightly delayed at the hotel which required us to accelerate our dining plan. We arrived just before 7:00 and were seated promptly. We let the hostess know we had theater tickets. Our server brought water and reassured us that he was aware of our tight schedule, we ordered steak and lobster. I had the thyme cocktail which was absolutely amazing. Not too sweet and very refreshing. The food came in about 20 Minutes. Oh.my.gosh. It was to die for. I think that must be the best filet I've ever had in recent memory! We also ordered a side of green beans almondine. Cooked to perfection! There was nothing on our plates that we did not like. The presentation was beautiful. The potatoes were scrumptious and portions were just right for which I was grateful. I don't like to waste, but I also didn't relish being overfull during the show. We finished our meal and settled the bill by about 7:40, called for a Lyft and made it to the theater and into our seats well before the start of the show.\n\nWonderful, beautiful, delicious and intimate yet casual experience!", "author": "Melissa L."}

I would check Per Diem's website for the most updated menu.\n\nIt was our first time at this restaurant and everything was delicious! We started off with the Smoked Bacon Tarte Flambee. This is a THIN flat bread shaped like a pizza. It was good, but the bread was so thin, it was almost like eating air. The Tarte Flambee will do nothing to help you satisfy your hunger. I recommend skipping on this appetizer.\n\nFor my entree, I had the Pasta de la Min, and it was one of the best pastas I've ever had! The mushrooms, truffle sauce, and duck egg all blended very nicely, and despite not containing any meat, it was very flavorful. My only complaint about this dish was that it was not filling enough. The portions at this restaurant are pretty small, and one dish won't fill you up, unless you want to break the bank.\n\nI also had a bite of my friend's dish (Filet Mignon et Frites aux Homard) and it was delicious! The steak was flavorful, not too chewy, and my friend could not stop praising the lobster fries.\n\nWe finished dinner off with some mango cake and a salted caramel pie with ice cream (sorry, can't remember the names). Both were good, but the pie was better.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and the food, despite the small portions. I told them it was my birthday in my reservation, but they didn't provide any sort of complimentary birthday dessert, just an FYI.\n\nFood: Delicious!\nPrice range: PRICEY! $20-$40+ per person\nService: Great!

Small enough that you are satisfied while you're waiting for your food, but not too much! \n- Cioppino: Was feeling in a seafood mood, and I wasn't disappointed! The tomato saffron broth was delicious and creamy - my only complaint is that the portion, though it seemed large, was actually a bit small. \n- Lemon tart: YUM. It was just the right amount of sweet and tangy and was a decently sized slice! \n- Chocolate pot de creme type thing: I expected it to be slightly larger, so this is definitely not a sharing dessert. Sometimes restaurants can make chocolate desserts way too sweet, but Per Diem got this one right! \n\nOverall, I'll definitely be back!

The muscles tastes like they usually taste, but the linguini definitely stole the show. It was light and buttery, the scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly. Amazing all around. We also ordered the creme Burke for dessert which I think would've tasted better if the top glaze was just slightly more crunchy.\n\nDrinks: We started off with a couple of cocktails and ended with some sparkling rose.

No bread still, even though other tables had it.\n\nMy boss ordered a caesar salad with chicken added, which ended up coming with no chicken, which she was obviously not happy about.

I've always come with a reservation, and have always been seated pretty shortly after arrival. Per Diem seems pretty full around lunchtime, and reservations do run out quickly so I would advise getting your table reserved to avoid the wait. They have plenty of tables to accommodate both large and small groups. \n\nI love the atmosphere and decor here at Per Diem. It's a great hidden gem amidst the many nearby grab and go lunch places. Service is amazing as well.\n\nThey've recently changed their lunch menu. It no longer includes their Cioppino, and the Roast Chicken is listed differently from before. I'm a bit sad to see those options gone, but my coworkers and I had the Petrale Sole Fillet and the Grilled Steak and really enjoyed our meals. The sole was served with a duo of leeks and a sweet potato mash which both paired so well with the fish. The serving size could be bigger when compared to how much food my coworkers received with their steak entrees, but I didn't leave hungry so I guess no change is actually needed. \n\nAfter our entree, we did go for some dessert. We ordered the chocolate mousse cake and the apple tourte with the salted caramel gelato. The chocolate dessert was very decadent and extremely chocolate-y. It wasn't too sweet as it included dark chocolate which was a delight. However, the apple tourte stole the show. It was light, crispy, and flaky. Every bite was divine.

I'm excited to come back to try out their drinks and the bucatini.  Shoutout to the waiter with his hair tied back, u da best.", "author": "Caitlin B."}

Obviously, in the City, room can be tight but it feels more open than other restaurants. Went upstairs to where our work partner was and still felt roomy. Upstairs has a bar and also a small, outdoor seating area (I thought that was very nice). They changed the menu for the day so I had to look at the menu for the items of the day. Starters were the brussel sprouts (yum) and a few other items that I can't remember now but it was all delicious. Ordered the tri tip sandwich with fries (comes with ketchup and horseradish and a French dipping sauce). The portion was HUGE! Even for a guy who can eat, every bite was delicious and savory and filling. Well worth the food coma that came soon after. Service was busy but still refilled everything and took care of everyone in a timely manner. Overall, very happy with Per Diem.", "author": "A o S."}

Came to Per Diem with a large group this week and the service and food were impeccable, start to finish.\n\nTo start, they hosted our crew in their private upstairs loft. I would live here if give the opportunity (and if SF rent wasn't ridiculous!). Yes, we were seated very close together, but what the heck do you expect for 20+ people in a small space for a seated dinner? \n\nA few of us arrived early and went to the downstairs bar for an aperitif! Love their setup, with stools around the L-shaped bar. Cocktails looked inventive and snazzy, but this gal went straight for the wine. \n\nTook our drinks back upstairs and indulged in a 3-course meal. Yumbo! First course was a choice of salads, which I had the basic greens. Nothing special, but it's difficult to get inventive with a basic green salad. A few people sitting close by had the summer squash and it look superb. Second course was the winner: lasagnette. Came in its own individual ramekin dish and was piping hot. Filled with pork and potatoes and lots of ooey, gooey cheese on top, definitely the best choice for a main. Other options included a papperdelle, swordfish or flatbread pizza. Lasagnette was the best. Final course was a chocolate roll, similar to the Little Debbie snacks we had as a kid. Only homemade and way better. They were so rich that every few seats shared a bite.\n\nWe had three severs dedicated to our party and they were spot on the entire meal. No one's water glass was left empty, everyone had at least a glass of wine and we all got our food at the same time. Not an easy feat with more than 5-10 guests at a time!\n\nKudos to Per Diem. Would love to come back for a more intimate experience.", "author": "Abby S."}

My cab driver made an illegal turn onto Sutter from Market, bless his heart, and neither of us could find this place. We knew what side of the street it was on, but signage left something to be desired.  So I hopped out of the cab and skipped across the street in my heels.\n\nThere didn't seem to be a lot of action in the restaurant and the hostess ushered me upstairs to where our party was waiting.  Finally! An evening with friends after a long week.\n\nI was surprised to see that they all had wine or beer on the table, yet the water glasses were still empty.  It took about 5 minutes or so for the waiter to stop by to greet me.  I asked for a Pisco Sour.  He said, \"We don't have that here.\" I said, \"Are you sure?  I mean do you know that you don't have Pisco or...\"  He then told me to look at the Spirits List, although Pisco is not a spirit at all.  He finally resolved to go to the expert, the bartender.\n\nLater he came back to tell me unfortunately they did not have Pisco on hand and offered their drink menu - but then walked away before getting my order.  How strange?  I had now been sitting at the table without water or a cocktail for over 10 minutes.  He did manage to take the appetizer order for everyone though.\n\nOk fine, fine...maybe I'm making this into something.  He then returned to ask for my drink and our mains.  We needed more time.  This was a birthday dinner and many of us hadn't seen each other nor spent time with each other since my wedding.  He skipped off and then like clock work, returned with my drink to ask us once again for our mains.  I looked up and saw the frustration on some of my co-diners faces.  We decided to go ahead though we really weren't ready and put them in.\n\nThe appetizers came out quickly which was great.  The pate was lovely and most likely not made in house.  The charcuterie plate was confusing and more pickled vegetable then anything else.  The little bit of cheese I did see was a nice selection but needed to be rationed between the table.  I almost felt guilty for eating any of it.\n\nThe main dishes finally arrived and we all cheered.  My husband had the filet with the lobster fries, I ordered the sole and my best friend ordered the mushroom pasta.  We immediately picked up our forks and started to try everyone else's food.  My husband's \"lobster fries\" were essentially cheese fries with lobster mixed in somewhere with some vegetables.  It was a pub version for sure, but lacking inspiration and flavor.  If it weren't for the fries themselves, it would've been worthless.  My dish on the other hand was awful.  I ordered the sole mainly because I hadn't been feeling well and it seemed like it would be the easiest on my tummy for now.  The sole was pan-seared (I think) but looked fried and came out incredibly dry.  The celery root puree barely made an appearance on the dish and was flavorless.  The brussle sprout side, though they did not glaze it in butter and oil like I ask was sad.  The vegetables were soggy, as was the bacon.  And how they were displayed on the rectangular plate looked like they weren't an official side at all but more like the kitchen was trying to do me a favor and get my greens in.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be back unless I'm stuck in the Financial District without options...which as we all know, there are plenty of options in San Francisco.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Unpretentious,  cute interior with a bit of touch from the \"mad men\"/prohibition era. High ceilings, copper carving, antique furnitures (one couch is perched 15 feet high shown high up in a window). Reminiscent of abc carpet in nyc. \n\nThe food is delicious with a lot of attention to details. The burrata appetizer is fluffy, mixed with honey on top of the toast, perfect for sharing between two or three people. I also like the mussels.  \n\nThe pasta are ok but not the best in the city. The clam pasta was decent, but an occasional sand particle accompanied the clam and pasta was overcooked. The wild mushroom tagliatelle was so so, a bit watered down.

While friendly, the waiter came around maybe twice and most of the time was no where to be seen when we needed something. The dish we both got for dinner was unimpressive and plain. We both ordered the squid ink pasta I believe it was, and it was the worst pasta I've ever had. And this is coming from someone who loves pasta, I can eat it plain with just butter, salt, and pepper. But this was something else. For the price, I was expecting to at least be able to tolerate it. \n\nMy final advice, beware of what you order, maybe ask how much flavor certain dishes have. Because unless you want to feel like you're eating air, I would speak up ahead of time. I also hear this place is better for lunch.

What this place has to do with anybody's daily allowance, I just don't know, although I could well imagine a lot of suits on expense accounts dining here to keep up appearances. The decor is apparently inspired by the 1849 Gold Rush with a predominance of dark woods and steel beams with a marble bar and a conspicuous chandelier encased in an oversized glass lantern. There's a 60's-style abstract painting of the Transamerica building at the bar which I assume is mounted there to remind you what city you're in. I've come here for lunch twice now, both times as a solitary diner at the bar just trying to test the limits of my plant-based dietary direction.\n\nThe first time I came I tried the $12 Panzenella Salad with Bloomsdale Spinach, which I thought was pretty good though a bit hamstrung from the puckery flavor of the fresh lemon oregano vinaigrette that was doused over it. It was mixed with chunks of roasted root vegetables, mostly turnips, and topped with shaved pecorino. The second time I visited, I ordered the $13 Berries and Rucola Salad, which was certainly pretty on the plate (see photo). The fresh raspberries and blackberries freckled the peppery greens and offered a nice contrast. It only came with two Shaft bleu cheese fritters, and I couldn't even taste the bacon lardons or even the bacon vinaigrette. On both trips, I ordered the $4 cup of Soup of Yesterday, which I assume was made for the dinner menu from the evening prior.\n\nI must admit the soup was the best part of both lunches probably because in both cases, it was luxuriantly creamy. The most memorable was the Carrot Puree with a drizzle of what I assumed to be extra virgin olive oil infused with red peppers (see photo). Chef Adam Hinojosa comes from the more traditional Osteria, so the Italian accents in the dishes are to be expected here. I'm not sure if the upstairs room has more of a dining room ambiance since the downstairs area appears to be centered around the bar with a robust wine and cocktail menu. Perhaps I'll come back with some colleagues to try those. Right now, my impression is that the food is above average with prices that seem a tad excessive for the portions. I would really need a per diem to cover the bill.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty good salads, soup is better even if it was made yesterday\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nice decorator touches and quieter than you would expect, at least for lunch\nSERVICE - 3 stars...reasonable, nothing more\nTOTAL - 3 stars...middling until I try some of their other entrees, I hope", "author": "Ed U."}

I read a lot of mixed reviews on yelp but then again a lot of people on yelp don't know what they're talking about when it comes to good restaurants and food in general. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor: \n\nMy girlfriend and I almost passed Per Diem up when we were driving by. It's in between what looks like to be a cafe and some type of shoe repair shop. I didn't know that Per Diem was located in the Financial District. The restaurant definitely stands out because there are no other restaurants surrounding it or near by. I really like this design of the restaurant from the exterior to the interior. Per Diem is a really nice restaurant! Who ever designed this restaurant did a great job! It's a very unique restaurant in my opinion. The huge brown entrance doors remind me of entering a castle or some type of mid evil establishment. The doors definitely enhance the overall visual effect of the exterior of the restaurant. \n\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you'll notice a huge bright chandelier that is hanging above. There are a few window shot tables located at the front of the restaurant. There's also a booth and a long stretch table closer to the bar area. The bar looked really nice and was a decent size. The painting located at the bar area blended very well with the overall theme and decor of the restaurant. Everything from the tables, real wood, flooring, and the granite looked very high end/expensive! I really liked the brick design located near the stairs leading up to the second floor. There are also two unique pillars that are resting on an area where they store bottles of wine. The lighting was dim and actually darkened throughout our dining experience.  \n\nI was curious to see what was on the second floor so I decided to walk up there and take a look. The second floor is amazing! It looks beyond nice! There were plenty of tables to sit at, ranging from a table for two to large parties. The lighting gave off an intimate ambiance. There was also a patio roof area where you could walk out to and look in the sky. \n\nFood: \n\nWe started out with the Flat Bread Del Giorgno (peaches, bacon, heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, arugula and pepper oil.) The Flat Bread Del Giorgno was delicious! The taste of the crust was very good. The texture was very crisp. It was one of the best pizza crusts I've ever had. The peaches tasted really sweet but not too sweet. The peaches and bacon really complimented each other. The pepper oil gave it the right amount of heat. \n\nI ordered the Bucatini (pork bolognese all'arrabbiata, shaved pecorino, crispy\nbasil leaf) for my entree. Now this is how a pasta dish should taste! The pork bolognese was one of the best sauces I've ever tasted! The sauce was loaded with a lot of flavor and the pork tasted very good. The pasta was cooked perfectly! I can understand why people on here recommend it. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Risotto (wild rice, farmers' market produce, parmesan, marscapone) for her entree. She liked the Risotto a lot! She said the veggies tasted really good and fresh. I had a few bites of her Risotto. I really liked the freshness of the veggies and the rice was cooked perfectly. \n\nService: \n\nOur waiter Jorge was very nice and attentive. Jorge was very knowledgeable about the menu and actually recommended the Flat Bread Del Giorgno...He said it tastes really good, he was right! \n\nOverall: \n\nPer Diem definitely exceeded my expectations. This restaurant has it going on! If you want a nice atmosphere and reasonably priced delicious food, you should definitely come here!", "author": "David R."}

Really pretty gross in terms of texture... That aside... \n\nPer Diem used to be a go-to for business lunches or the occasional lunch date, however since the new chef came on in recent months, changed the entire menu without warning, and drastically ran up the prices for a LUNCH menu, I'm not particularly interested in returning.\n\nFor $7, you can find yourself enjoying 5 leaves of butter lettuce, some red onion rings and a little dressing. For $30, you can get decent (but not necessarily impressive) salumi and fromage plates that almost equal a lunch for two. The croque madame is fine for $15, but dumping mornay sauce on a sandwich does not necessarily improve it. They have started making their sandwiches with some other bread than they were previously using and it simply underwhelms. The onion soup is too sweet (really lacking in salt and beef jus) and reminds me of something I would pick up at Safeway, not a quality French restaurant. \n\nI miss the fresh fish selection, the pork ragu, the salads that were actually meal-sized, the seasonal pasta selection.

Filing consultant contracts, I would be in awe of the payment terms \"USD 1,000 per day plus $150 per diem\". As I looked at my paycheck, I would silently curse at myself for ever majoring in Human Resources aka Professional Paper Pusher aka Office B*tch. \n\nFrom the people that brought you The Brick Yard (a sports bar in the Marina) comes Per Diem which is located in the epicenter of the Financial District. Boosting two levels and two bars with dark woods, bronzes, and steel beams the ambiance was reminiscent of the Gold Rush Era. The space screams M-O-N-E-Y which is correctly captured in their old money and new money cocktail list. Glancing over the $13 cocktails, I asked myself, \"So THIS is what consultants use their per diem (daily allowance) for?\" Again, I silently cursed at myself; talk about choosing the wrong career path. \n\nAlthough categorized as New American cuisine, Per Diem's menu is very Italian-centric. With 5 apps, 4 salads, 5 pasta, 4 entrees, and 3 pizzas options, I thought the menu was a bit scant (the online menu had more choices). Unless you're carbo loading for a marathon, there were few options. \n\nWith my imaginary per diem to burn, I started with the Blue Chip Martini w/ Bleu Cheese & Olive Crostini ($13). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=4yVLomcsA_-c0l1U4g3Jsw Worth every penny, the Nolet's Gin martini was stiff and made for one \"happy\" hour sans the happy price.  \n\nWe started our meal with the PEI Mussels in a Fennel Sausage Broth ($12). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=6havZYT-e-fqvAcXcJ-MSA What the mussels lacked in size, the complexity of the broth made up in flavor. The rich, herbaceous broth was intensified with the small chunks of fatty sausage. I think \"spicy\" was inadvertently omitted from the title as the broth packed quite a powerful and lingering heat. \n\nEverything was going seemingly well until I got my entree. The Braised Tomato Truffle Brisket, Lentils & Marinated Cipollini Onions ($21) was a disaster on a plate and should have never left the kitchen.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=mjnQ_DyMJRmv3A6qypco1w The brisket bricks were severely underseasoned and not braised long enough (to break down the collagen in the connective tissue) causing the texture to be that of shoe leather. Instead of a butter knife, a chain saw should have been included with this dish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXy-YMQCWpBJf92HFRhGhw?select=BsSgdKyB2osonsfzswGb9w The accompanying lentils were overcooked to a prison food mush. Tomatoes? Truffles? I think they were playing hide & seek on me as not even an essence was present. \n\nService was pleasant but unpolished; understandable for a restaurant open less than three months. However, simple things like providing new utensils (after taking ours away) and refilling BOTH our water glasses were overlooked. \n\nThough Per Diem has solid cocktails, their menu and food need work. I'll be back though...the day I have the luxury of a per diem.

I made reservations for last night at 6pm through opentable.com.  Though their menu prices slightly differ from their online menu, entr\u00e9e prices are reasonable considering you're in the Financial District.  \n\nFOOD:\n*Steamed PEI Mussels ($12) - Good and exceeded my expectations.  Although the mussels were a bit on the smaller side, the fennel sausage broth was delicious!  Generous pieces of sausage added additional flavor to the already flavorful broth.  Do beware, it is a bit spicy.\n\n*Cioppino ($19) - So delicious!  The tomato broth was thick and hearty with a slight kick.  Per Diem does not use fish or fish stock (yay for me since I'm allergic!), but shrimp stock instead.  Mussels, deshelled prawns, calamari, and shredded crab meat were added to the stew.  You'll definitely make use of the accompanied grilled crostone.  The serving size is enough for one without you feeling overly full.  Since we had an appetizer, I ended up bringing half my cioppino home.\n\nBoth dishes are highly recommended!  My friend had the truffle brisket and it looked quite dry.\n\nSERVICE:\nThough the food is four star worthy, the service area is where they were lacking.  Our waitress was nice, but we felt like the service portion was missed throughout our meal:\n*After receiving the menus, our order wasn't taken until 20 minutes later\n*We weren't told the specials, I had to ask her\n*Our appetizer plates were not taken away before our entr\u00e9e plates were brought out\n*I had a fork and knife, but didn't have a spoon...how was I to eat my cioppino? \n*My water glass was filled, my friend's glass was not even though she had less water than I did\n\nPARKING: \nMetered street parking which is relatively easy to find after 6pm.", "author": "Nicole S."}

That was my introduction to Per Diem. The girl at the front tried to seat us at a little table right in the foyer, right where people where standing.  When we refused that and insisted that we be seated at a table not located right by the entrance, we were told that no tables were available.  Only when we started to leave did a table on the upstairs terrace magically open up.  And surprise--there were three empty tables up there!\n\nService was worse--I think she wanted to turn the table in the worst way because she kept interrupting us. Here's a hint--let people finish their sentences before barging in.  Good servers know to do that and she was definitely not a good server.\n\nOh, and the food....wish I'd left when I had the chance.

Starting with the drinks, I had the MXN and it was WAY too spicy. Those jalapeno peppers made it really hard to drink. My friend and I shared the steamed mussels and fries together. The mussels tasted good but they were super tiny and there was a lot of them that were unopened. The fries were really undersalted, which is really sad. For the main courses, my friend ordered the wild mushroom pasta and I had the squid ink linguine. I definitely liked my friend's pasta better but it was pretty heavy. I liked the lemon cream flavors of my dish's sauce and the seafood was cooked really well. However, the flavor of the actual pasta was really boring and bland. For dessert, my friend and I shared the creme brulee and warm apple tart. The creme brulee was NOT good and was a huge disappointment.... until I tried the warm apple tart and that was even worse. The apple tart tasted like an old apple muffin that was crumbling everywhere. \n\n- THE SERVICE\nWe came during happy hour time but we made reservations so our hostess seated us up on the second floor and to the very back of the restaurant. Initially, I was really glad she did that since it was really loud downstairs. However, this caused us to be hugely ignored the entire time we were dining here.

Well, besides the fact that it's smacked dab in the middle of a great spot in FiDi.  It helps that it's not bad to look at either (some grandeur booths, exposed concrete, dark wood, a beautiful chandelier).  \n\nA couple of coworkers and myself met a client here a few months back around 4 on a weekday.  We were able to snag a booth, but with the small size of the seating space and it being in FiDi, it got very busy as we ended our meeting.  Service was fine and we ordered some drinks and light bites.  I got a pisco punch and it was perfectly balanced and so refreshing.  For light bites we shared a veggie flatbread and oxtail poutine.  The flatbread was probably my favorite of the two although the oxtail poutine was a good snack for pairing with cocktails.  I haven't had poutine since Salt House a few years ago, as it's not that easy to find here and is so rich & heavy.  Not a bad place for drinks and bites, though still a little pricey, but then again, it is FiDi.\n\nI actually tried to get a table for a party of 12 shortly after Per Diem opened up about three years ago.  It was a little holiday reunion dinner with 11 other girls I went to elementary school with.  I called to ask if I could make a reservation and they said no because of their small size, and weren't very apologetic/sympathetic.  I don't have much knowledge of the restaurant industry, having not ever worked in a restaurant, but I thought this was kind of rude and also a dumb move, because, who wouldn't want to be guaranteed that money?  Especially since restaurants on Fridays and the weekends in FiDi aren't that busy because everyone is going/at home.  Though, I came here a few months ago per our client's request, I guess I can forgive Per Diem for this, but I'm not sure if I would ever come here myself unless someone else picks the tab up, just because that still doesn't sit well with me.  \n\n3 stars for now for the good service here though during our visit, some good drinks and not too shabby bites.", "author": "Cat C."}

I walked in and my first impression was 'wow this is bougie' but what do you expect from the Financial District? \n\nAt 7 pm on a weekday night it was incredibly loud downstairs by the bar. Like imagine sitting really close to your friend just so you can shout at them \"WORK IS GOING GREAT!\" If you're trying to have a conversation with your dining companions I would direct you to the upstairs, which feels like an imitation of a rich guy's home library, complete with shelves lined with books that people buy purely for decoration and random cushy armchairs in between tables. The lighting is dimmed, giving it a more intimate atmosphere.\n\nI had the pinot noir, which hit the spot, and for apps we ordered burrata and pork belly. I had cioppino for my main dish. Burrata is a type of Italian cheese on grilled crostone (bread) with honey, sea salt, and toasted almonds. It tastes like greek yogurt lite and the consistency is a little funny and runny. It tasted fine, but it's something you could whip up pretty easily yourself. You could spend your money better elsewhere. The pork belly was succulent and soft and it comes with broccoli rabe and a cute lil baby egg. The cioppino comes with shrimp, crab, mussels, and calamari in a tomato saffron broth with crostone. The seafood tastes fresh and really pops with the broth but it is the most expensive entree on the menu.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly (never seen that many smiles in one meal) and very knowledgeable about the drink menu. We were also sitting there after everyone else had left and the restaurant was about to close and she never rushed us but did ask if we wanted dessert before the kitchen closed.

I wish I can say I like Per Diem but I'm meh on it for the following reasons:\n\n1)  It took 40 minutes for them to serve us any kind of food at all.  It's the tail end of the lunch rush so I don't understand why service was so slow.  People, we have to go back to the office, how hard is it to cook a burger and a quarter of a chicken?  You lost our dessert business because we were afraid we will be stuck until happy hour here.\n\n2)  Mary's chicken was flavorful but too salty for my tastes.  The veggies acted more like garnishment than sustenance.  You don't even get a half chicken.  It looks like you get a drumstick and a 1/4 of a breast.  Not worth the $15.\n\n3)  Insult to injury, they tacked on an extra 4% healthy sf surcharge.  As I said before this is such a passive aggressive move by restauranteurs.  Really, just add it to the cost of the menu.  That surcharge is disingenuous at best.  Do the staff actually benefit from this or are you pocketing the monies at the end of the year like some fake SF restaurants.  IRS - taxable income right there if they keep it.\n\n4)  We were not offered bread.  Bread would help considering the chicken was miniscule.\n\nOn the other hand, the burger that my friend had was good. I should have ordered that but who wants to have McDonald's food when you eat at places like this?  Decor was nice but a tad dark.  The lights were too dim to read the menu.\n\nService was meh.  No status on the meal, they didn't check in on us at all, nothing.\n\nWill we be back? No.", "author": "Wendy H."}

They were visiting from South Africa and after a day of sightseeing were dressed casual, but not unpresentable.  When I walked in the host blatantly gave them the once over and then said that they were full but a table had paid but it was going to take 20-30 minutes before they left (he didn't even check the screen for the table seatings upstairs).  The comment was clearly meant to deter us from eating there.  \n\nI feel a little shunned, my parents were not dressed terribly.

This is a wonderful space and I'd return for the feel alone. \n\nThe food was very good, not great. I did expect a touch more artistry in each course-let me take that back, the chocolate dessert, whatever it was called, was truly inspired. But the rule held true for the rest. The Organic Greens Salad was precisely the salad I envisioned when I read the title, and while that's not a bad thing, a restaurant with this kind of potential should take advantage of my taste buds. Molest them, even. I had a taste of the romaine salad, I gotta say, not much going on there. Mary's Chicken reminded me of a more polished version of the bird I cook on a regular basis at home: flavorful, juicy, the potatoes were delish, but there wasn't much more to it. Lest I forget the pea shoots nestled alongside, those were marvelous.\n\nSo I'll say this for Per Diem: you're on the right track. Clearly consistency is highly valued and emphasized. Nailed it.

I've seen the good, bad and the ugly when it comes to group dinners...and Per Diem is most definitely on the good list.\n\nMy party of 25 took over the gorgeous room upstairs, which was set-up in the shape of a square. It was so ideal that we could actually play an icebreaker and hear every individual sitting at the table. I can't remember the last time we had such a perfect set-up for a large group dinner!\n\nThe servers were on top of their game and got the food out very fast. As for the food it was very tasty. We had pre-selected options for the appetizers and entrees. I started with the pancetta salad followed by the pesto pasta. Both were so delicious and relatively large portions. I was full pretty early on, but it was too good to stop...which I kinda regretted later on as I entered a food coma.\n\nFor dessert they brought platters of chocolates for everyone to share.

A cornucopia of American classics, Italian rustic, whole animal, and locavore in flair, I would come back tomorrow if I could for the Bucatini. Chicago and San Francisco are pretty far apart, but paying tribute to their support of local flavors, I can still taste this dish in my mouth like it's right around the corner. \n\nThe next time I'm in San Francisco I'd like a repeat please. For starters, the Organic Local Green Salad was delightfully light and flavorful, and the perfect introduction to my hearty portion of Bucatini. Plump and tender spaghetti-like noodles covered with a generous topping of rich seasoned soft ground pork, this dish literally melted in my mouth like butter. That might explain why I honestly couldn't stop eating it, even when I could feel my stomach bulging with goodness. I'm also a sucker for pecorino cheese, so that could have something to do with it too.\n\nThe location of this place is easy to get to, but because of its uniqueness, it caught me off guard when I had to walk into and through a mall-like atmosphere to find the entrance. Once in the door, this place is an open concept charmer with dark woods, shelves of books around the outer edges, old globes, and chicken wire cabinets. Italy meets barn-like goodness here in d\u00e9cor. \n\nA great place for parties of approximately 20 or so people, the upstairs is perfectly suited for this. Part of a business dinner of this size, our group took up the entire upstairs front room yet it was cozy and not too compact. I also liked the fact I could see everyone I was dining with. \n\nGreat wine, excellent service, and need I say anymore about the Bucatini?", "author": "Angela S."}

Upstairs in the dining room: calm, cool and collected.\n\nThe food: we started with the charcuterie plate which was large (easily shared between 3 or 4 people) and had several cuts of cured meat. I did think a small improvement in better bread selection and slightly less pickled vegetables would have made this a 4-star plate. For our entrees, I had the bucatini which came in a meat ragu sauce. It was very oily which later gave me a tummy ache, but was pretty good overall. If I could make a suggestion I'd say more chunky tomato, less oil and butter.\n\nThe drinks: I had a pimm's cup which was good, a little weak.\n\nThe service: Service was friendly but kind of absent.

I checked out their menu online and saw that they had cioppino.  I then cross referenced the restaurant on yelp to make sure the opentable reviews were not BS and even went to the length of typing cioppino into yelp's search feature within the restaurant review.  Score! Based on the other Yelper reviews, the cioppino here sounds like a winner.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant and were promptly seated upstairs.  The server greeted us shortly after being seated and took our drink orders.  We both said that water would be fine, Thanks. The server says \"two ice tea's coming right up\" and darts off. No, wait.. we didn't order ice tea, I shouted.  Oh.. no ice tea?  Nope. Later as the server was taking our order, we asked him how big the salads are and if it's big enough to share. Not giving us a description, he puts down his writing tablet and says it's about that size.  Um.. do you mean the plate or the portion because your tablet is flat. The server couldn't really explain so we just took our chance and ordered the caeser salad to share. Turns out the portion is quite generous and perfect for sharing. The salad was quite tasty but doused with way too much dressing which left the leaves a bit soggy.  The dried garlic was a really nice touch though.  Next time, I'll order the dressing on the side.\n\nWhen the cioppino arrived, I was quite satisfied with the portion size and amount of seafood.  To my surprise, cioppino was kind of spicy which was not indicated on the menu.  I eat a lot spice so if I can taste it, it might be too spicy for people who can't handle spice.  The ciopinno tasted delicious but I was disappointed that they didn't give me a spoon to eat it with. Trying to hunt someone down was next to impossible so I ended up eating the entire thing with my fork.  What I couldn't pick up with the fork, I dipped my bread into.

First, he mumbled and was inarticulate, so I had to ask him to repeat more than 1/2 of what came out of his mouth!  Anyway, in what should have been a sign of things to come:  When my friend said Kir Royale, his mind heard something called a ******maker.  Then, when he brought this erroneous *****maker, we told him the order was Kir Royale, and he asked if we wanted it neat or on the rocks.  Huh?!?!?  We didn't even know how to respond.\n\nThen, he \"coursed\" our meal in a really bizarre way.  For 3 people, we ordered a pizza, 2 salads, the Tagliatelle with a medley of veggies pasta dish, and the Bucatini which was some thick spaghetti'ish pasta soaked in a delicious pork ragu, with four, yes just four, shavings of pecorino.  The Tagliatelle had a slightly spicy kick that made what could have been a boring vegetarian pasta tasty.  The pizza was mediocre.  Not sure about the salads since I didn't have any.  \n\nAnyway, back to the story of subpar service, we confirmed to Mr. Waiterman that the pizza and Tagliatelle would be shared, and he decided that meant to serve the pizza and Tagliatelle as the \"first course,\" then to serve the salads and the Bucatini as the \"second course.\"  Maybe it's just us, but we thought it made more sense to serve the pizza and salads as firsts, then the pastas as seconds.  The worst part about the weird \"coursing\" was it meant we had to wait 30 minutes between our \"first\" and \"second\" course.  Mind you, this is after waiting 20ish minutes for drinks.\n\nOf course, he had to top it off by charging us for items we didn't have, which took more of our time to correct the bill.\n\nDespite the maybe slightly above average food, the crappy service just about ruined it, bringing what could have been a 4 star rating to 2.  Per Diem isn't a cheap eat, so if I'm paying those kinds of prices, I expect a certain standard of service.

I mean, you just walk in and start feeling serious once you see the dark wood everywhere, vintage hardbound books and other old-timey props.

It felt even more serious once they led us into their upstairs area for our reservation, and sat us at a huge, serious table that was probably a bit too large for our party of 5. \n\nIn any case, the food we had for lunch was excellent so I could really lighten up and look past all of the seriousness. After much hemming and hawing I went with their oyster po'boy, which was very simply dressed but super tasty. I loved the fresh taste of the sourdough bread and the relish they used. All of the selections I saw come out looked excellent, especially the pasta choices. The prices are expected for a nice place like this in the financial district - about $13 for my sandwich.

It was heavy on the scotch, but I actually prefer a bit more vermouth.  \n\nThe atmosphere borders on the traditional but cozy. Lots of dark wood, steel beams and large pillars. Cocktails aren't cheap being $13 each, so I wouldn't make this a place to get wasted. However, put this on your radar if you want a classy crowd where you can sip your cocktail slowly and enjoy the jazz music in the background.", "author": "Janice C."}

I had set up a reservation at H&H for lunch with a colleague for a Friday in December. 2 days later I got a cancel message. Turns out they had a buyout (that time of year, I guess). I was perturbed, but more because I'd have to start my search all over again and don't get to SF often. Well when I was talking to the mgr at H&H she offered a recommendation and that was...Per Diem. Love, love, love that confident, customer centric approach. I will absolutely look up H&H next time I'm in town.\n\nSo at Per Diem, the place has this really funky style that just works. Total heavy wood motif with 19th century faux-gaud artwork and antiques placed throughout - totally works. \n\nI had the Cioppino (it was cold and rainy and that felt right) and my friend had the Ravioli. We both loved, loved our lunch. I had a Tempranillo by the glass that paired perfectly with the Cioppino. The Cioppino was spiced aggressively but in my opinion, perfectly. My friends Ravioli was smooth and tasty and, before I could blink, disappeared from site.\n\nI'll be back!", "author": "Bill B."}

The decorations are fun and interesting. Today, I decided I want to try this place for lunch. I found that Per Diem lacks decent hospitality. The two front desk people were more interested in giggling at each other than asking me if I had any questions regarding the menu. That's not the issue though.\n\nAfter briefly looking over the menu, I picked the chicken sandwich with the heirloom tomato soup. The wait wasn't bad for my to-go order. I work super close to this restaurant so as soon as I got my food, I was back in the office. It was so disappointing to find that the heirloom tomato soup was lukewarm and, for the most part, unappetizing. Seller's Market has better tomato soup. Also, when I tried the sandwich, the bottom was soggy. \n\nOverall, maybe I didn't get the right sandwich or Per Diem serves hot soup only if you eat at the restaurant, but I'm disappointed. The bill was $16 - I should have went to Chipotle a couple times instead.", "author": "Irina R."}

I came for lunch with coworkers and though we had a reservation that was not met, we were squeezed into a table in the front of the house. The decor and ambiance of this place is beautiful: both light and airy. I didn't have a chance to visit the upstairs but, as far as the downstairs dining area and bar goes - it was pretty classy with a beautiful chandelier adorning the ceilings and a great wood bar.\n\nThe menu consisted of a variety of salads, sandwiches and reasonable priced entrees including pizzetas, pastas and a lasagna of the day. I went with sharing the crab melt and the ham and cheese sandwiches that were both accompanied with side salads (there was an option to add fries or soup for a couple extra bucks). The crab melt wasn't my favorite. The sandwich was extremely rich with the super intense butter overpowering the crab. There was potentially cheddar or some type of cheese involved adding to the rich experience of flavors.  The ham and brie was a delicious sandwich that was light and full of flavor. I've always been part of the school that you can't go wrong with brie and this sandwich proved me right. I love when that happens.\n\nThe service was great and overall this was a great lunch break that both left me satisfied and happy. I would most definitely come again and look to try one of thouse gourmet pizzettas.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

A drinking place with pretty good house made pasta.\n\nDownstairs there were a handful tables catering larger groups of 5 for dinner and a bigger space for the Fidi named drinks.\n\nBut I came here for dinner upstairs, which was at quite a different pace. You leave the noisy Fidi crowd who looks more like fresh grad first job crew, to a more secluded upstairs dinner only space. It was all table seating and the upstairs bar currently is used for keeping glasses but there maybe some planning to make it a standing drinking area as well.\n\nNopat (Bulleit Rye, Coeur de Lion Calvados, Punt e Mes, Benedictine, Bar Keep baked apple bitters) was good solid and not watered down. \n\nLook beyond the drinks was the semi-bar style appetizers and I had the burrata (misspelled on menu) with honey and almond flakes. It was good but nothing too impressive.\n\nOn the dinner side, they have 5 entrees, 5 pastas, 3 lasagnas and 3 pizzas. Since they proclaimed it's an Italian and Californian (Italian name but really more Californian style) with house made pasta, I had Orecchiette Puttanesca (also misspelled on menu.) It was spicy on the subtle, with lots of prawns, anchovy sauce, cherry tomatoes and small sized capers. It was quite tasty,\n\nThey currently don't serve desserts as they are still working on expanding their dinner menu such as Artic char and duck confit, The funny server did suggest a martini as desserts.\n\nHalf way through they decided to turn on the lights on the outside and wow my \neyes lit up! It's a nice patio! It's small but very pretty with a chandelier. The outside ladder had a library lookalike ladder but from where I sat it looked like a fire escape.\n\nApart from that the interior has some copied Van Gogh oil painting, with part of the back not yet utilized other than a couple chairs. Very classic and I totally dig it.\n\nAs noted, the service was on and off fast, as they apologized they had to serve both the people downstairs and the dinner patrons upstairs. Overall it was decent and very friendly service.", "author": "T L."}

NOT IMPRESSED and won't be going back! \n\nFood flavors were just OK but definitely small dinner portions in comparison to the price and other comparable restaurants. \n\nEven though we each had a cream based cup of soup for starter we weren't really full after completely finishing our entrees... The soup was delicious! \n\nI ordered the pork chop special, it was a 1\" thick small palm size cut (including the fat and bone) with literally 3-4 thin roasted carrot strips for $28. After cutting off the bone and fat trimmings I was left with a very small piece of meat and with no substantial side on the plate I was still hungry.\n\nMy husband got the pasta that the server recommended as their most popular dish and at $20 it was just a spaghetti bolognese with severely under cooked pasta and 30-40% smaller portion than the average comparable restaurant. \n\nI think the biggest disappointment was the service... Our server was very scattered minded, slow, and couldn't answer food related questions properly. I honestly think he was high... every time we wanted something or had questions I had to literally get up from the table and grab another server for assistance (happened 3-4 times) as he was no where to be found.... he didn't even check after the food arrived to see if we needed anything else. My husband wanted Parmesan for his pasta and 10 minutes after the food was served I had to once again get up to grab a bus boy....  VERY FRUSTRATING!!! \n\nThe service pretty much ruined the dining experience and even though we weren't full we didn't want to stay longer to order dessert. \n\nIt is tricky to label this place as moderate $$ range where in reality with their smaller portions you definitely spend $$$ range per person.", "author": "Shell S."}

The same could be said about the meatball, it was too salty and for $9, there was only one meatball.  The two pastas came and it seemed as if they knew they put too much salt in their appetizers so they decided to compensate by not putting any salt on the pastas.  Both of them were extremely bland.\n\nThe food really wasn't worth what we paid and it was just disappointing.  It's pretty safe to say I won't be back.", "author": "Pierre L."}

There also wasn't any seasoning or herbs on the fries beyond the typical McDonald's smell and overt saltiness.

I work in the Citigroup building, right across the street from Per Diem and it always looked popping during lunch time.

The upstairs dining area is super cute.\n\nService: Good, given the fact that it was prime lunch time, the waitress (forgot her name) was very attentive and checked up on our table plenty of times. \n\nFood: Ehhhh. I ordered the porcini mushroom parpadelle. It sounded like a stellar dish on paper (chard, roasted wild mushrooms, thyme-Parmesan broth, truffle oil and creme fraiche). Such luxurious ingredients...so I was thinking, this dish is the winner. The dish was a disappointment. There was WAY TOO MUCH truffle oil, it was extremely overpowering and I couldn't taste the lovely porcinis. I love truffle oil but there was just a lack of finesse in the truffle oil use...truffle oil should always be used carefully. The creme fraiche on top of the pasta seemed like a great concept, i just don't think it was executed correctly. And okay, there is a time and place for chopped green onions. But green onions on top of my pasta as a garnish?! No!!!!!! It doesn't work!!! I also wish they could've mentioned that the dish had chili peppers in it! I wasn't looking for a spicy, overly truffled mushroom pasta and that's exactly what I got. \n\nMy first experience wasn't completely super effed up because of that parpadelle. The place is beautiful (filled with well-off fidi folks but it's coo) I will try the burrata or the bone marrow appetizers next time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-01", "description": "I'm just the IT guy and taste tester. My wife writes all the cools stuff\n\nA couple days after Christmas we headed into San Francisco for a day and had dinner at Per Diem, based a friend's recommendation.\n\nLocated in the Financial District, Per Diem features an Italian and Californian influenced menu.  The exterior from the street is unobtrusive and its best that you know you're looking for a restaurant.\n\nUpon entering it feels as though you step back in time to the age of San Francisco's early beginnings.  The decor is oversized and dark, warm and cozy, with hints of old world library.  It feels like a place, in which groups of men would retire to after an elaborate dinner, to have cigars and digestives.  Dark, warm wood, concrete walls, large old books, globes, and a wood and marble bar inhabitant the two-story restaurant.\n\nThe menu is a traditional Californian Italian menu -- starters, pizzas, salads, pastas and entrees.\n\nWe started with the Steamed PEI Mussels with Sausage and Crostone, along with the Burrata on a Grilled Crostone with local Marshall Farm's Honey, sea salt and toasted almonds.  The sausage adds a nice spicy kick to the briny sweet mussels and the crostone allows you to sop up the extra juices.  I loved the sea salt with the honey and cheese.  The Burrata is sweet, smooth and creamy while the honey offers a warm, amber sweetness and a nice textural difference, the sea salt helps combine the two beautifully.\n\nWe tried two salads.  The Panzanella with Bloomsdale Spinach combined orange, beets and lemon vinaigrette.  The panzanella added nice texture, soft centers but toasted with a slight crusty exterior, which allowed it to soak up some lemon vinaigrette.  The spinach was fresh and sweet.  We also ordered the Wedge Salad with buttermilk dressing and bacon lardons.  I love wedge salads, and don't know why I never make them at home.  They are simple, but seem very filling and substantial, even though its mostly iceberg lettuce.  I love the crisp, refreshing lettuce.  This buttermilk dressing had a wonderful balance of sweet and savory, with a hint of acidity, which helps the dressing feel a bit on the lighter side.\n\nThe meatball pizza is a great dish to order if they have it.  The sweet meatballs are sliced into rounds and placed on top of ricotta and cheese pizza.  The crust is thin and chewy, with a slight crispness.  The topping/crust ratio is excellent.\n\nFor the main entree I ordered the Papparadelle with Pork Ragu, beets and broccoli rabe.  I was a bit hesitant about the combination, since the beets are sweet, pork ragu tends to be on the sweeter side of savory and the broccoli rabe can be quite bitter.  But, it was something I've never thought to combine, so I gave it a whirl.  It was good, but I don't think I would combine the broccoli rabe with beets and ragu again.  I understand ingredients are used to balance flavors, but this combination didn't work for me.  I tasted each ingredient separately, but they didn't enhance one another, or complement one another.  I did love the pork ragu and the delicate pasta.\n\nOverall it was a wonderful dining experience - service, atmosphere and food.  I will definitely return if the opportunity arises.", "author": "Chad G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-10-12", "description": "This 2-star rating is directly connected to the experience I had with the waitstaff of this establishment. Here's the story: My sister and I were in the city to pick up our Nike Women's Marathon race packets in Union Square. My sister wanted to grab an early dinner so I quickly Yelped \"Italian\" restaurants near Union Square. After perusing the offerings, I decided to give Per Diem a try. Fit the bill at being close by, somewhat casual, and having Italian fare (pasta/pizza). \n\nWe walked in at 5:00 p.m. and the bar seemed comfortably lively with a crowd that looked like they worked in the Financial District (which I expected). I walked up to the hostess stand, where the two hostesses were giggling and one was busy plugging in her iPhone. They glanced disinterestedly at me and my sister. I gamely stood there until one of the them finally looked over and said, \"Hey. What's up?\" REALLY?!? I was a bit dumbfounded at her greeting- typically the standard hostess greeting is \"Hello! How can I help you?\" I asked, \"Do you have a table for two?\" She glanced around and said seriously, \"Umm. We're REALLY busy right now.\" I continued, \"So, are you taking reservations?\" She said, \" It's open seating anywhere you can find it\".  I glanced up at the stairway that led upstairs to my right. \"What about up there?\" \"Oh!\" she said. \"Yeah, that's for dinner only.\" I looked at her and said, \"Yea. We'd like to eat\". This changed her tune. She chirped, \"OH! Yea, there's lots of tables upstairs\". Success!\n\nWe were taken to our table in a mostly empty dining room (I counted two other two-tops in a room that had 15-20 tables?) The waiter appeared instantly and took my drink order. After we had ordered food, he asked for the menus back. I asked him if I could keep the drink menu as I was probably having a second drink. He said \"No problem\". However, each time he came to the table, he attempted to take it back and I had to remind him that I wished to keep it (it's not like there were other tables needing an extra menu). \n\nDuring the short wait for our food, my sister and I opened our race packets and started looking through the swag in the bag. The food (an organic greens salad and mushroom pizza) arrived. We moved some of our stuff to the two-top next to us and dug in. The salad and pizza were very good. After we were half-way through, the waiter came by and said, \"You're going to have to move your stuff. I'm seating this table\". Then he grabbed my drink menu and left. When he came back, I questioned, \"Why would you seat THIS table (indicating the table next to ours) when ALL these other tables are empty?? Just curious!?\" And he said, \"Oh in about 5 minutes, this WHOLE place will be PACKED.\"  Wow, I was impressed. \"OK\", I said, and I moved my things. Funny thing was, we stayed for 20 more minutes and the table was NEVER seated. And a total of 2 other couples were seated in the meantime but at tables miles away in a [still] mostly empty dining room. As we paid the bill, I asked him why the place was still pretty empty and the table to us was still not being used. He shrugged and said, \"Well, you know how it is, everyone is waiting on other people. Believe me, this place will get packed.\" \n\nIt's an understatement that I'm not impressed by this place. Food was good but there's WAY too many great restaurants in the city to put up with this pretentious crap.", "author": "Wendy N."}

Sorry.\"\n\nThis is despite always spotting empty tables. I've also never tried to go here after 8 p.m. I'm not a caveman; I know how to make a reservation. But this place looks like a work lunch or after-work drinks spot, not a place I should make special plans to visit.\n\nHaving said that, I had lunch here today at the bar and it was pleasant enough. Boyfriend's fries were a good portion, crispy, and they came with aioli and ketchup. My chicken Caesar salad had freshly grilled meat and a smattering of lettuce. Prices were not worth the experience. I paid $5 for the \"champagne of ice tea,\" which came in a store-bought bottle. To make an Arnold Palmer with it -- which involves a simple task of filling half the glass with lemonade and then pouring the tea -- they charged an extra dollar. If you brought me half a glass of lemonade, I could do the rest.\n\nI'm a frequent diner at Boudin down the street, which makes their salads daily in a vat.

In a few words - good food, terrible service. \n\nWe really enjoyed the lunch - collectively, we ordered the Mary's chicken, a sandwich and soup, a pizzetta and the cioppino. The chicken and cioppino got high praise - very flavorful and great portions as well. We also ordered the slightly overpriced but yummy Arnold Palmers - the Republic Darjeeling iced team came in a massive bottle and you add the lemonade, served seperately, according to your taste. \n\nHowever, the service was uniformly terrible. We had to hail down our waitress for our initial orders (lunch group so we didnt have a lot of time). However, we barely saw her again - she served us our food but did not once check in on us. I was served the cioppino w/o a mussel fork and no vessel to hold the empty shells (had to hail her down to ask for one). Then, she cleared the table while one of my friends was still working on her drink - didnt even ask if she was done. \n\nSince it was a group of 6, we were automatically charged a 20% gratuity. We paid our checks but went down to complain to the hostess / manager that the service was lacking. This is where it gets worse - the manager did nothing to  make our experience any better. Note to hostess/manager: the whole point of patrons mentioning an issue is so you can make the experience better before they leave the restaurant. Telling a patron that you will talk to the server does not make them feel better about paying 20% for crappy service and does nothing to improve the current experience. \n\nAt this stage, I will vote with my wallet and choose not to go back to Per Diem (and encourage others not to), unless, the restaurant can make better amends than offering to  \"talk to the server\".", "author": "Rumesha A."}

When I first entered, I expected an antique store.  My friend, a frequent lunch customer, brought me here for a Good Friday lunch.  We were led to their upstairs dining room and seated in the back, away from the window.  Familiar with the menu, my friend immediately ordered two appetizers to share as we studied the lunch entrees.  We both ordered the crab melt, except that I changed the salad accompaniment to the soup (french fries are the other option).  \nA short time later, the two appetizers came piping hot.  The mussels were served with three toast wedges and ground sausage pieces in a tangy broth.  The fritto misto comprised of a generous portion of battered calamari, shrimp, and fish pieces, served with lemon wedges.  \nWe just finished the appetizers when the sandwiches arrived.  The sandwich was cut in three triangles with a cup of Minestrone set on one side of the plate; the crab filling was tasty and garnished with some cooked red peppers.  I could not finish it and brought one triangle home.  The food quality was four-star worthy.  \nThe dining room is pretty dark and the noise level can get a bit loud, as mentioned in Michael Bauer's review a week later; the service was also a bit uneven (minus 0.5 star).  The lunch menu ranges from $10.00 to $14.00 for the most part which is reasonable for this part of town. Being an avid lasagna fan, they have a daily special, which was chicken today, but it didn't sound particularly interesting.  Hope it's a mushroom one my next trip here.  3.5 stars.", "author": "Mike C."}

I really wanted to like it, but it was an EPIC fail!\n\nThe cute seating area upstairs and my company were the only two positives of my dining experience at Per Diem. \n\nFirst off, I know that as a veg head I can't expect restaurants to cater to my non meat eating dietary restrictions. However, I've never had a restaurant be more unaccommodating than Per DIem. When asked about vegetarian pasta options, the waitress said, 'Well all the pastas have meat in them, but if you really have your heart set on a pasta... I guess we can give you the tagliatelle dressed in pesto.\" Seriously? You expect me to pay $20 for that? The chef can't throw in a few mushrooms? Heck, I'll even take a few peas, anything.\n \nNonetheless, even after that convincing statement from our waitress, I opted against the pasta and settled for a vegetarian pizza. It was some potato, leek or celery concoction. Not seasoned at all and lackluster at best. \n\nOh wait, don't let me forget the horrible appetizer we ordered. Whatever you do DO NOT order the 'Burrata on a Grilled Crostone.' It was terrible. Just picture a store bought piece of bread with mozzarella, slivered almonds and honey smothered on top. Ok so maybe everything minus the store bought bread sounds good, but trust me it was the worst excuse for an appetizer that I've ever seen. Especially at a restaurant that has the gall to charge $10 for a piece of bread!!!\n\nOverall bad restaurant, especially for vegetarians!", "author": "Reena P."}

Make reservations for 2 at Per Diem via OpenTable, but when you ask your mutual admirer out, don't mention that this place really is fine dining. It sounds more casual, less date-y. Say you chose it because it's never too loud or rowdy but it's not a snob's affair by any means, and it's convenient to the Montgomery BART station. If your date asks what kind of bar they have, tell him/her that the drinks are fantastic, but beer and a great selection of wines are available, too. Ask if a table in the front window would be possible when you make your reservation.\n\nDon't try to be the hot shot foodie who knows everything there ever is or was to know about food, wine, and booze, it's not impressive. Instead, ask your server and the sommelier for the specials and recommendations. They are both happy to go into loving detail about what's happening on the menu, so just let them do the talking at this point. Think twice about ordering anything that may be difficult to eat with a fork, except for maybe the burrata with honey and hazelnuts, which is just too good to pass up (and if you order any seafood including mussels or oysters, don't even THINK about using the word \"aphrodisiac\" at ANY point in the night...ugh). \n\nEnd the night with a recommended dessert wine.

By far the highlight of my meal was the perfectly tender bucatini served beneath a generous layer of pork ragu, which featured a well-rounded combination of tangy, savory, and spicy flavors, and a complement of shaved pecorino and basil leaves.  My fellow diners raved about the delicately decadent burrata on a grilled crostone, which was both light and satisfying.  On the other hand, the salumi platter (proscuitto, sopressata, coppa, salami, olives, cornichons) was a bit uneven, and -- due to the absence of starch with the order -- had to be supplemented with \"bread service\" (at a nominal fee of $3; hopefully not per person, but I don't recall).   \n\nThe service during our late lunch (i.e., 1:15 pm reservation) was courteous, responsive, and prompt.

So we waited at the bar and marveled at the decor. No biggie.\n\nThey seated us near the bar area which is fine. The drinks menu is very creative - they have \"old money drinks\" and \"new money drinks\" with names like Dividends or Bubble Theory. Pretty cool. As we ordered our drinks, we perused the simple and very promising menu. \n\nWe waited a while for our drinks and ordered our meal - burratta, 6 oysters, salads (dressing on the side), pasta and duck. \n\nThe first round of food showed up - the pasta and... a pizza?? Whups, guess they brought us the wrong order. My friend's salad arrived as well with dressing mixed right in and my oysters were nowhere to be seen. We flagged down someone for the oysters and he gave us a funny look and asked - \"You want your oysters NOW?\"\n\nAs we were eating our oysters and my friend was enjoying her salad, suddenly ALL our entrees showed up all at once - my duck, the pasta and my other friend's salad, which was not big enough to be an entree per what the waitress said. Our table wasn't big enough to accommodate everything. \n\nMy duck was delicious - the broth, the bleu cheese ravioli, the mushrooms - everything came together. If I wasn't so annoyed at the service, this duck would have led me to come back for more.\n\nWhile we were sitting there, my friend got a \"no-show\" notification on Open Table - given the woman at the front couldn't find our reservation, I'm not sure what went wrong there. \n\nThe food was really good but I felt that the staff was underprepared and not particularly knowledgeable.

I work across the street, and our little pocket of the Financial District has been begging for an after-work watering hole for years!

Not really a \"professional\" environment so-to-speak. Basically, the market is wide open for Per Diem to flourish, but they need to improve their model. \n\nCouple suggestions for the owners:\n\n*Go for the sports bar \"Royal Exchange\" vibe instead of the sheeshy wine bar  vibe. I was in their the other night and felt like I needed to lower my voice a few times. \n\n*Get flat screens lining the walls with sports games playing. This will bring more energy in general to the place.\n\n*For the love of God, hire an architect that's worth a damn. Why is 20% of the space taken up by that obnoxious hosting table/waiting area in front? The place is already on the small side as it is!\n\n*Cool down the Kegs. My IPA's were just barely above room temperature.

Young beautiful girl with a great smile and made some great drink suggestions to us. For somebody that had not been there long, she really knew a lot about the menu and drink specials. I loved the \"Manhattan Project\" with the Whistle Pig 10yr Rye. We were only going to stick around for drinks, but when our friend got off work he met us there and we ended up having dinner there too. Turns out, this is one of his go to places and told us he was planning on bringing us here. I know there are many places in this area you can choose to eat, but once you find a place you like this, you want to go back. My wife and I will definitely be back again the next time we are back in SF. Go in and ask for Bree, she will take good care of you. Also, read some of the reviews for food from Per Diem, and I don't know what the old menu was like, but this new menu with new chef seems to be great. I couldn't decide what to order because every plate that was coming out looked delicious. I could have ordered everything.", "author": "Rigo B."}

I like to think of myself as a simple eater although my friends call me picky and a hard person to take out.  Oh well.\n\nThe atmosphere is super hip and cool; dim lights, upstairs loft seating with a bar and cool old fashioned books for decoration.  The drinks are great including specialty drinks that change frequently and a pretty good wine selection.  To start, we had the marrow which was a first for me and I did my best--it was peppery and buttery and I took a good faith bite like I promised I would.  I saw almost everyone around me order it, so I am sure that people who love marrow, love the dish.\n\nFor my main dish I ordered the king salmon and YUM was it good!  I am a salmon freak and it satisfied all my salmon dreams.  I asked for a box shortly after I got my dish, but ended up eating the whole thing and leaving the box--oops!\n\nI was told that the menu will change monthly for now--with the hopes that weekly changes can happen soon. I am excited to see what is added and love the feel of the place!  I will be back, and--you cant beat the location! Right next to Montgomery BART!

She made it quite clear that she didn't appreciate our lack of a dinner order and took every opportunity to push/make faces when she came over. Frankly, it got to the point where I was actually enjoying making snarky comments back at her so we didn't get up and when we should have.

It's charming with French-inspired decor, intimate and has delightful food. \n\nUpon entering, it's like walking into a French cafe in the middle of Paris. The restaurant is narrow with dark wooden beams and blues in the decor. There are small tables all around and a small bar that lines up to the kitchen. They also have a staircase leading you to more seating. It's an adorable restaurant, especially for a \"ladies who lunch\" kind of day. \n\nThe menu has several options and most likely something for everyone. They have the typical soups and salads as well as a variety of pizzas. In addition, they have a decent sized list of sandwiches as well. I shared a crab melt as well as a ham and brie so I was able to try both. Don't be fooled by the dull description of the ham and brie sandwich. I must admit that I wasn't sold by the sandwich when reading the description on the menu. Ham and brie on sourdough? That seems like a very boring option. However, the sandwich is anything but dull. It's actually delicious and one of the better sandwiches I've eaten in awhile! Yes there is ham and brie, but the ham is warm and freshly sliced, the brie is creamy and the sandwich is topped with sweet onions (I think they were onions at least) as well as a sweet mustard. The bread is perfectly soft and it truly melts in your mouth. I will find myself thinking about this sandwich after I leave the city. I definitely liked the ham and brie more than the crab melt and going into it, I thought I would think the opposite. The crab melt was a little too mayo-happy. It was good but after biting into the ham and brie, it just wasn't giving me the happiness the ham and brie did. \n\nThis restaurant is right up my alley and I will definitely keep it on the map for visits to SF, especially when it's time for a Mom/Daughter lunch or catch-up lunch with girlfriends!", "author": "Lindsey D."}

We were seated upstairs, which was great because I could actually talk to my coworkers without yelling. We were seated right next to a little atrium, which gave the table location a nice atmosphere. \n\nUsually I only order an entree if I go out with friends, but for some reason business dinners always include much more food (oof). I started out with a glass of pinot noir. When it arrived I wondered where the rest of my wine had gone. Their wine portions are very skimpy. For $12, I expect my glass to be more than half full. I had a shrimp cocktail for my appetizer. That was good and the shrimp was fresh. My portion included 6 shrimp, which was totally acceptable. For my entree I had their swordfish special. The fish was delicious. It was served over kale and a carrot puree (I omitted the rice). The kale could have been cooked better. Some of it was nicely crisp but other pieces were chewy. Dessert was a chocolate roulade, which was a like an uptown version of a Hostess Ho Ho, but that hit the spot. It would have been better with some sort of creme fraiche addition to make it a little creamier. \n\nI have to agree with some of the other posts that service is slow. Our waitress was pretty attentive and our water glasses were filled often, but the time between courses as well as just getting the appetizers started was slower than it should have been. I don't like being rushed during dinner, but the wait time was just too long, and I can't see why given the fact that it was a Monday night and we had early reservations (6 pm) before the crowds started arriving. \n\nAll in all a solid meal, with room for improvement in timing.", "author": "Lori M."}

My coworkers consumed a crab melt sandwich, and a pasta dish with a meat sauce (buccatini?), while I had a margherita chicken sandwich.  My coworkers seemed to generally enjoy their items, and I enjoyed my chicken sandwich, but it was a little dry and bland, missing some sort of intangible to make it 'great'- thus it was not so special that I would insist on ordering it again.  The side salad accompanying it was rather bland and flavorless too, so I would steer away from that in favor of some other side.  Service was prompt and attentive.

At least come by and ask us if we wanted to order drinks etc. In fact , we had to hail her down to ask if she was our server (which it turned out she was). During lunch she never came by even once to ask if we needed anything. It made it worse, because we did need few things and again had to hail her down for our requests. \n\nI don't have a problem tipping a generous 20%, however, it needs to be earned. Since we were a party of six they automatically added the gratuity. I think this system needs to change since all it does is promote bad service to larger groups because gratuity is guaranteed. \n\nWhen we complained to the manager all she said was \"I will talk to the server\". \nThat does nothing for me as a patron. \n\nI choose to opt out of going to that place.

He had much more personality than you tend to find at hotspots like this at the busiest time of the night. Without being overbearing or ignoring his other tables he interjected every new course with his wit, including a funny anecdote about Aretha Franklin doing shots of lager and eating rhubarb when we told him we were considering doing karaoke later that evening. I'm not really sure if he completely made it up or not, but it totally sold us on the amazing strawberry rhubarb \"pie-zetta\" with creme fraiche gelato.

At this point I've tried and enjoyed them all, but the Eva Peron and the Wingtip are the bomb dot com.\nPS- I noticed someone commented about the eyes of some of the hostesses.

Yes, entirely my fault I mis-ordered the fritta misto, thinking it was a seafood salad. And maybe I should have begged to send it back and reorder. Instead, I told the server/bartender that I had thought I was ordering a salad, and that I hate fried food. She shrugged and said \"It's not a salad, it's on the menu as a side dish\" and even opened the menu to show me. No offer to exchange it for another item. I didn't eat it, and a while later she removed the plate and slid the check to me without a single comment.

What I enjoyed most (separating this place from the others in the neighborhood) is that the staff is attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the restaurant and decorative history.

Well, as often happens, 4 people couldn't come so we were down to 8 people and were nervous how we would meet the minimum. When we got there and explained the situation, I was expecting the worst, but the host was so laid-back, he wasn't concerned about it and as to be expected, it was easy for them to fill the 4-top after they moved it away from our table.\n\nWork lunches, especially with a group are tough as inevitably people don't have time to sit there for an hour and a half, but some of us got there on time and ordered apps for the table and those came out in good time. We had drinks quickly, our order was promptly taken and we were easily in and out, with a group of 8, in an hour. I was impressed.\n\nWe ordered the special anti-pasti plate and that was good, but I have to admit, I was expecting a bigger platter. We also ordered 2 pizettas which were good. I think it's kind of silly they charge for bread service though, but the bread was good.\n\nI ordered the brisket sandwich and it was very good, the meat wasn't piping hot, but it still tasted good and the bread they used was excellent. Good side salad too - you have to order the truffle fries separately. Someone at the other end of the table ordered then but I didn't try.\n\nI love the decor of this place, very cool, staff aren't the least bit stuffy, overall, I was impressed.

The decor was superb, the people were good looking and the food was fantastic.  Let's start with the decor, old meets new, charming, rustic, all pieces were restored and refinished contributing to the charm that defines San Francisco.   Upon entering I was greeted by the host and hostess.  They were friendly, warm and polite. \n\n I was seated upstairs and that's where the food love affair began.  What to order...so many incredible choices.  We started off by ordering a glass of wine, the Chardonnay by the glass was fantastic.  Not to sweet and nice and crisp.  Cooled to the perfect temperature, not too cold.  As we cheered to a great lunch, our appetizer arrived. Burratta...a wonderful cheese on a rustic piece of bread with honey and slivered almonds drizzled on top.  What a great combination of marrying sweet and savory.  I ordered the shrimp louie salad for lunch.  The pickled eggs were delightful, the shrimp on top of the salad were fresh and the dressing was perfect.  I was very happy with my order.  My dining partner ordered the Bucatini.  I did not try it, however he ate every last drop on his plate and oohed and ahhed saying how delicious it was.  I wish we saved room for desert, but we were both so full and will have to be back to try something new as well as the desert. \n\nTo sum up the experience; the decor, staff and food was all top notch.  I will be back and would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience in the financial district or SF.  \n\nCheers!", "author": "T T."}

Upon publishing my first review, I was immediately contacted by Chris, the General Manager, who graciously offered my husband and I a special tasting menu with wine paring. I really was looking forward to trying their food, so we took him up on that offer. \n\nSaturday, 7/14, we arrived and were seated in the front of the restaurant (I felt a little like we were on display). Chris immediately introduced himself to us, and the chef (Adam) came out to meet us as well. They treated us to a 6 course tasting menu with various samples of Chris' favorite wines (Chris is also the wine manager). To say they went above and beyond is saying it lightly. Chris checked in after every course, Adam even hand delivered a couple courses to us. For dessert, they gave us a \"tasting\" of gelatos, then came out with SIX scoops on a platter! \n\nAnd here's what I'll say about the food: I love that they believe in fresh, local, organic ingredients. Adam served us 2 different cheeses he hand made earlier in the day. We had a honey / cheese bruschetta, heirloom tomato / fresh mozzarella salad, hand made linguini, calamari, a giant veal/lamb/beef meat ball, and gelato. \n\nOverall, THIS meal was great. But I know that meal is not what one would typically get at this restaurant. So overall, I'll give Per Diem 4 stars. I LOVE the decor, the menu seems interesting, but since it's a newly opened restaurant, I think they really just need to work on figuring out how to run it efficiently. If they can do that, it'll be fabulous. Both saturday's we were there, it wasn't super crowded (chalk it up to being located in the heart of FiDi, with little to no foot traffic.)

That wouldn't be much of a problem, except that a friend recommended the place and got me excited for a number of dishes on the regular menu. Also, $75 dollar prefix at a place I have never been to is sort of steep...\n\nStrengths:\n- Fantastic Service\n- Great Entrees, well flavored and presented\n- GREAT Cocktails\n- Upstairs is great place to take a date\n- Cool Atmosphere\n- Great Pasta\n\nWeakness: \n- Starters \n- No mention of prefix after talking to 2 people and no mention on website\n\nWe sat on the top level which is definitely a deep contrast to the bar portion downstairs, which seems like a great place to hang after work. Our server, a young man with reddish hair, was absolutely fantastic. He gave great tips and was in that perfect space between checking up on us too much and not enough. The drink he recommended (blood and sand) was insanely good and was very happy with my selection. Even the busser was always there to clean the table and swap utensils. \n\nFor starters we had the beef tartar and the citrus crudo. Both dishes were extremly underwhelming, as the tartar was pretty much a hockey puck of raw beef in a bowl with an egg on top and the crudo (\"an Italian cuisine, crudo is a raw fish dish dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and citrus juice such as lemon juice and sometimes vinegar\") was using citrus and no fish. Both dishes seemed aimed at presentation and not tasting unique. \n\nThe \"salad\" portion was fantastic, as we had the goat cheese and radicchio salad and the pasta dish. The home made pasta was out of this world good and made me wish that I could have ordered a full size pasta dish as my main entree. The salad had some extremely creamy and tasty goat cheese, something I usually am not a fan of. \n\nThe strongest part of the meal was the entrees, which is always a good thing. My ladys veal was out of this world good and was definitely a 5 star caliber dish. My ahi was solid and the bean under-garnish was really tasty. Portions were perfect too. \n\nDeserts were really good (fresh fruit roulade and a fig tart) and were a great way to finish the meal. \n\nThis place is close to 5 stars, but the lack of communication and the mediocre starters keep it at a 4 or 4.5. I plan on going back to try the place on a regular evening and eat some of the more traditional italian fare (like some of the hand made pasta which I sampled). This appears to be a great place to eat and drink with friends, or take a date (upstairs). Good stuff Per Diem!", "author": "Nick B."}

Let me start by saying, the place is super cool & cozy  - make sure you ask to be seated upstairs. Overall, the ambiance is great, and the wine list is decent & not super-inflated like most of the city's restaurant, but the food, at least what we ordered was...fair. We started with the pork belly appetizer. We both felt it was over-cooked & very salty. We both had pasta entrees, but husband liked his ( although the bite I had, the noodles were a tad undercooked for my liking). I had the daily special lasagna, which I thought was delish & true 'comfort food' as it came in its over cheese-laden baking dish, all brown on the edges & gooey..yum! But the caesar salad it came with was topped with these weird and again VERY salty fried onions on it. Yuk. I picked them off & tried to salvage some of the salad. The service was very good, and the staff very approachable. So.....will be come here again? For cocktails or lunch, sure. But not sure about dinner...too many other places to try!", "author": "Jen S."}

I was 15 minutes early for our reservation and the rest of my party had not yet arrived.  They seated me anyway and served me water and asked if I wanted anything anything else (more than once)!  Our server was courteous, professional and attentive (taller female, blond hair with waivy ponytail).  \nThe food was good too.  Spacious and bright (which I like) near the entrance; nice atmosphere!!", "author": "Chris D."}

Atmosphere is amazing, good crowds and whether you go for drinks or a meal, you won't be disappointed. The food is amazing, be sure to try a variety and save room for dessert!  Also, be sure to check out the upstairs - especially the outdoor area.", "author": "John C."}

Per Diem has all of those things and more.  I am so pleased to endorse this restaurant.  Let me break down why I enjoyed my evening at this joint.  First, upon entering, I could see from the decor that this was going to be unique meal.  The rooms are warm and cozy with lots of woods and ornate golden framing as well as chandeliers.  Next was my drink.   I ordered the wingtip, a wonderful spin on an old fashioned that I enjoyed greatly.  The food was a knock out.  I had a green salad and the prosciutto and asparagus pizza, I sampled my girlfriends rainbow chard pizza and also my friends cheese platter.  All three were excellent and decadent.  Finally I was blown away by the service.  Our server Tom was attentive, knowledgeable about the food and made excellent suggestions about food and beverages to be sampled by first time diners.  I find that service can make or break a meal and in this case it made a great meal even better.  I look forward to my next trip out to Per Diem and I highly recommend to others that they give it a shot themselves.", "author": "Jim S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-09", "description": "The food here was pretty good. The appetizers were awesome. The pork belly with egg and truffle is almost too good to be edible. Man alive was that good. The meatball was good as was the pizza. My main course left a little to be desired. I had the pesto pasta with clams. The sauce was a little over-salted and I felt there were more shells than clams. I would've preferred they put just the clams in the pasta and add a few clams in the shell as decoration. I actually got tired of scooping out pasta sauce and pulling out clams from every shell. I didn't finish the dish because of this. Where I really found this place lacking was in the service. Granted it was a Friday evening during Happy Hour but for at least the first 30 mins after we were seated, we were completely ignored. It was a business dinner, a group of 5 of us so we were sat upstairs (love the decor by the way). After half an hour, our waitress finally took our drink order. It took another 20 mins to get them. After she dropped off our drinks, she left again for another 5 mins before asking us for our appetizers. Took about 13 mins for that. Ok so by this time we're starving and completely devoured the appetizers. When she came back we let her know we were ready to order our entree and instead of taking the order, she says \"I'll be right back\", WHAT?!?!? Seriously?!?! Took her 15 mins to come back. Finally got our orders and by the end of the meal, were too exhausted to order dessert. After working all day, you kind wanna eat, talk and go home. Now you don't want to feel rushed but you don't want to be ignored either. I think all of us who were seated upstairs for dinner were all neglected for the happy hour customers downstairs as I saw the same group of people at the various tables from the time we were seated til the time we left (at least it wasn't just us). Perhaps adding a separate staff for us upstairs diners would help. I don't think I'll be back here unless I have 5 hours to kill and I'm not starving.", "author": "Shariyah M."}

So many reviews said to get the crab melt, so I did. I wasn't impressed. Not much crab, mostly just an expensive greasy grilled cheese sandwich. I would not eat that again, and indeed, warned someone else the second time from getting it. The interior was cute, two floors, nice ambiance. Others got the crab melt, I think a pasta dish, and a pizetta. I came back again for another birthday lunch, and was seated downstairs this time, a little cramped, not as cute as the top floor, still nice. I had the asparagus lemon pizetta. Much better! It was crispy, light and tasty and had an egg right on the top. Often, I don't like asparagus, but it's in season and fresh and tasted very good mixed with the other ingredients. Other people got the chard pizetta, the mushroom pizetta, and the pimento burger. Everyone really enjoyed theirs. I'm glad I came back because the second time erased my meh impression that I'd had the first time. I think my pizetta was about $14, so definitely not a place I'd usually come to for lunch on a workday, but great if you're meeting friends. It's not big enough to share, or for dinner, but a good size for lunch, left me feeling full without feeling gross or weighed down. I haven't tried their dinner.", "author": "Merredith L."}

From the internet photos of the dining room & the prices we assumed this to be a nice restaurant.  When we arrived we were seated not inn the dining room but at a 3-top by the door in the bar, (the hostess claimed we'd requested this, the worst possibility in the restau.)  It was a cold night and the constant comings & goings froze us near to death.  A man wanted to smoke so he placed his beer on our table.  Food was just okay for what turned out to be pub cuisine.", "author": "Derek N."}

I was excited to try this new hot spot in the FiDi and I'm glad I did. The atmosphere of the place was really cool. High ceilings, and a really cool vibe. I came around 6:45 on a Monday, and it wasn't super packed, but I'd still recommend making reservations. I can see this place being quite busy right after work hours. My only complaint about this place is the very small menu. Not that it's much of a complaint because everything on the menu looked exquisite, but I'd like to have a few more options for entrees. I'd definitely recommend this place for a small snack and drinks, but would like a stronger entree menu for dinner in the future. I ordered the Papparadelle pasta which was absolutely delicious. My friend enjoyed her Buccatini very much as well. All of the pasta dishes were between $12-14 with a few heavier entrees between $17-25. They also have a small selection of appetizers and salads. The pasta is made fresh in house and you can definitely taste the quality.  I was very impressed with my dish, and I'd definitely order it again. The dishes all sounded very creative, and I'd like to come back to try more. Service was amazing. I really hope this place does well!", "author": "Ashley D."}

We put ourselves on a waiting list for a table in the area by the bar, and the host unfairly (we think), let a man at a table move to a bar stool in exchange for letting the couple at the bar have the table instead.  The man's companions had left and he obviously didn't want to sit at a table alone, but I don't think it was really necessary to cater to his whims.  We spent about 45 minutes (and two drinks each) waiting and finally gave up.  We won't be returning to this place.", "author": "Elaine T."}

They were sold out of multiple entrees at 6pm on a Tuesday night (they only have a handful of entrees to start with), as well as a side dish.  The carbonara special was more like alfredo and had red peppers in it, not a great combination.  The panna cotta for dessert was almost a liquid consistency.  Truffle fries were underwhelming.

Upon entering the restaurant, I could tell the dinner experience wasn't going to be great. Anytime the noise level in a restaurant exceeds the ability to talk and be understood you know it can only head down from there and it did. I was seated with my companion at a high table right near the bar. The noise level was ridiculous. I can understand bar banter and the downtown crowd wanting a new watering hole but as a restaurant this place doesn't cut it. We ordered the burrata pizza and the orechiette. The burrata on the pizza wasn't very fresh and clearly either was the dough making up the crust of the pizza. The orechiette, while handmade, wasn't cooked properly. I like my pasta al dente, not like cardboard with a crunch. The water in which it was cooked clearly wasn't salted enough and you could tell the orechiette wasn't finished in a saute pan. It was pulled from the water pot and into the serving bowl. As most of the other reviews highlight, it's great for drinks for the downtown crowd, but for dinner, I wouldn't count on Per Diem for a enjoyable meal. The noise level as stated is ludicrous and the food, which could compensate to some degree, doesn't by any stretch of the imagination. I imagine Per Diem won't have much staying power as a dining experience and probably end up being a  place for the downtown financial crowd to meet for drinks until another watering hole manifests itself and the crowd moves on.", "author": "Daniel M."}

When we got there for lunch today we were a little nervous because when my friend ordered a Bloody Mary they told her that the one thing they don't have is tomato juice.  Whaaat?  But we had a really great Chardonnay (several) and that more than made up for that mistake.  The food was great.  We started with the burrata which was the best I've ever had.  I had the Mary's Chicken--the best downtown--crispy skin and the meat was perfectly moist.  My friend had the pasta with mussels which she said was \"divine\" and there was an ample enough portion that she had them box it up so she could take it home.  The service is phenomenal!  Ross is the best waiter that I've come across downtown in a long time and one of the best in the city.  After dinner drinks (yes, we enjoyed the place that much) need a bit of work.  They weren't sure what a B&B was and when they made it from scratch, they did a very good job but then they served it chilled, in a martini glass.  So, I'll say food--great; service--excellent, wine selection--top rate, cocktails--work in progress.  I will be back.  Often.", "author": "M W."}
