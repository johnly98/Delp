I love the neighborhood and this strip of Octavia is particularly serene and cozy.\n\nThe cafe is fairly small with tables squeezed in snuggly around the corners of the cafe, leaving the center open as a walkway around the cafe. The restroom was surprisingly clean and not too compact, considering the total space of the cafe.\n\nI love the giant open window at the front of the cafe, although the day I went was a bit too cold for me to enjoy it being opened. I ordered a latte with almond milk, which was neither bad or amazing, though a bit on the smaller size. The barista who took my order was courteous, and I'm glad that they accept Apple Pay here, as I forgot my wallet.\n\nWould definitely come back to this little nook to do some work over the weekends, I just love the Hayes Valley neighborhood vibes that this cafe perfectly emulates (it's quite romantic)!", "author": "Victoria W."}

My friend and I just wanted a hot drink (we both got the spicy chai's) and I ordered a veggie bagel combo.\n\nThere is zero space inside, so if you're in a large group, search for a meeting point outside the cafe...but send one person in to order everything. We sat outside in the public area under a tree, but we saw customers with their dogs sitting at provided small cafe tables or other public seating too. It's a great spot for a lazy and easy-going Sunday morning.\n\nIt's basically a two-person show the day we went, so be patient if you're ordering a lot of stuff. Props to the two baristas/cashier's running around the place taking orders and making the meals/drinks. Service won't be with a smile or overtly friendly, but I'm sure it's because there's just so much to do between them to...it was just average. My spicy chai was flavorful, but wasn't hot enough and a little on the sweet side. I wish the spicy chai was actually...spicy. The veggie bagel (I chose everything bagel) combo was delicious with the fresh hummus and veggies in it--I was definitely full and felt so refreshed.\n\nThe good thing is the cost of everything. My drink and filling breakfast was just under $10! I miss the authenticity of cafe meals just being under the \"teens\" of pricing. Props to Cafe La Vie for keeping to it. Their menu is extensive with the bagel and croissant options--with everything looking so tasty and fresh. Their pastry box is full of other delectable goods sweet and savory, so check it out.\n\nWill be back next time I'm in Hayes. This is a no frills joint that plays deliciously jazzy music.

The reason I rated this place 3 stars is because of the person making the sandwiches/bagels. He was SO rude to multiple customers including me.

For example, a customer asked if a certain order was his and the person working responded with, \"Yeah I called it out like 3 times\". Once my order was ready, another customer and I got up to grab the item (we ordered the same bagel with cream cheese) which made it awkward.

In the category of \"sit, chill, do some work, sip some coffee, maybe grab a bite to eat\", this place does pretty well.  And, it's tucked away not far off the main Hayes Valley drag, but on a quiet street.\n\nYou're going to find the regular cafe-fare here.  All the Coffee and Coffee-Drinks you'd expect.  They also have Bagels, Breakfast Sandwiches, Scrambles, Lunch Sandwiches, as well as Pastries.  All the food I've had has been good and fresh-made.  I honestly tend to stick with a simple Bagel with Butter, and Coffee.  Or a Diet Coke, as Adam S. is wont to do.  (They charge $1.25 for a can of Soda - come on man, it should never be more than $1.)\n\nThere's a good vibe here overall.  I love the space - it's intimate, but very open.  The front of the cafe opens up entirely (think clear garage door) from the seat-level up.  There is also outdoor seating.  The inside is cozy, and has art on the wall from local artists - which has changed frequently over the last couple of years.  The service is good - although it can be a little slow compared to other spots.  Just be aware if you have to race back to the office.  But that said, they're not slow because of bad service, they just make things fresh and it's not a soul-less assembly line.  They take the time to talk.  \n\nWinner.  I like having it near the office.  And, who cares if it takes a little longer - I've learned over the years the the office will almost always be there when you get back.", "author": "Adam S."}

NEVER AGAIN! \n\nYOU WANT RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL WITH YOUR COFFEE, BY ALL MEANS VISIT THIS PLACE!\n\nAs I sip the coffee purchased from this cafe, the barista calls my attention and tells me \"Are you really going to just sit there and not buy anything? If you're going to sit here, you need to buy something to eat or drink. This is only for customers who purchase things.\" I understand this rational, but what followed is a different story. \n\nMy friend tells him that I am drinking the coffee that was purchased 15 mins ago. I confirm this. He said oh, and apologizes with a very sassy attitude. Then adds, \"you don't need to look at me like that as I already apologized.\" I was puzzled as I was looking at him with confusion.

Also, right after touching the cash register, she started making my sandwich without a glove or cleaning her hands, which was disgusting because I have worked in tens of different restaurants and sanitization should be a priority. but I still decided to go this morning to get a drink as I always do, and I found her again.\nShe always seems to hate her job, always grumpy and impolite.\nI got a hot chocolate and I reminded her to give me the neighborhood discount as I always get because I work nearby.

However, somehow along the lines I guess the barista forgot and switched the bagels. Not a big deal, except that I really wanted that poppy seed bagel and now it has been covered in salmon...aaaand it was the last poppy seed bagel. So now, I'm just the littlest bit annoyed because the garlic bagel was really nothing amazing. I mean just such a meh-bagel. Like why do you even bother making this bagel? Could barely taste the garlic.\n\nI also ordered the spicy chai drink - which for $4 for the smallest size, I was expecting more than literally just tea. Like maybe even a latte even?

A healthy assortment of pillows and cushions line the windowsill closest to the door, creating a comfy seating area for work. There's also ample charger strips littered around the cafe, so you really don't have to worry about fighting your neighbor for a slot. The interior is a bit on the smaller side though, I was guess max seating capacity of about 20 people.\n\nWhat really resonated with me, however, was the personality of the staff members here and how they interact with other patrons. This place seems to be a popular spot for locals, as nearly everyone in line before me struck up a casual, friendly conversation with the barista. Definitely a no judgment, good vibes place to hang out. \n\nPrices are very affordable, and very deserving of the 1 dollar sign. Unfortunately, I did take off a star because they closed their kitchen at 4pm, 2 hours before they close. Quite a shame too, as their sandwich selections looked robust and interesting, and clock in at around $6-$7.

Just keep giving them that blank stare that clearly says I hate my job.  Fine I don't bother with pleasantries with her like I do with the other barista.  But when you serve people rotten food you have crossed the line.  I ordered a veggie bagel with avocado which is extra and a medium hot chocolate.  I noticed my cup felt light but I was like whatever Sam made it.  When I was at my desk I open the cup and it was only 2/3 full.  My bagel had about a spoonful of avocado that I paid extra for and it was brownish/black and clearly rotten.  This was all done deliberately. I could tell she has a nasty attitude from the moment I placed my order. Was it because I was as friendly to her has she was to me? Most definitely.  I threw everything away because a.

It's not a chain and it's not super flashy.  The staff are super friendly and actually remember who I am after I've been in a few times.\n\n2.  It's sooooooo cheap!  For $2.45 I get a Cafe Au Lait that is HUGE, like a bucket of coffee (equivalent to a Starbucks Venti).  It's on the same quality level as all the other neighborhood spots (Boulange, Grove, Arlequin, etc...).  You can get a huge egg+cheese+meat+veggie bagel sandwhich for $3.95.  My husband had it and loved it.  Simple but great.  Their oatmeal with fresh fruitl is only $2.50!  The places mentioned above charged $5-$8 for an oatmeal and some dont even offer fresh fruit.  \n\n3.  Their havea huge assortment of cookies that are vegan from \"Alternative Baking Company\".

Window seats, small tables against the wall, and my personal favorite, the table in the back with the fireplace are available depending on your mood/weather. \n\nMy favorite coffee tenders, Kim and PK make this place feel like home away from home and George the owner drops in daily with a smile on his face.

There are countless reasons to pick another coffee dwelling over Cafe La Vie.\n\nBut just like \"The Hurt Locker\" in the 2010 Academy Awards, this small, independent shop has more charm and flavor than the rest combined and I guarantee it will win you over. \n\nAlmost all of the front of the store is a large garage door that's kept open and provides a constant connection between the strong brewing beans and the valley in which it's being consumed. There's enough room for about 8-10 people to sit inside with a few more hugging the perimeter in tables and chairs. \n\nThe service is what caught my eye. I don't remember the barista's name, but she was so personable. And not in a \"she said 'hello' and smiled\" way but rather in a \"I want to be her new best friend\" way. It was a warm afternoon and I asked if they had iced coffee and she said \"duh. I'm not serving you hot coffee. You'll pass out.\" We got into a discussion on who would be more likely to pass out. She let me know the (free) wireless password and I was on my way to the back where I drank my (surprisingly delicious) soy-infused cold treat.\n\nThe only downfall is that the seating isn't ideal if you're working on a laptop. Whether you're in the L-shaped booth in the back or the seating area up front, the tables are well below your normal reaching level and you either have to bend over a lot or sit with your laptop in your lap (imagine that). \n\nIf the tables get higher or the seats get lower, I think Cafe La Vie is well on its way to obliterating the local Avatars of Hayes Valley.

That explains why businesses on main streets tend to be so crowded (and pay such high rents).  Cafe La Vie is a great example of what happens when you stray off that path --  but in this case, we're taking like 50 feet!  Barely off Hayes, yet I have to admit I never noticed it before reading about it here on Yelp.\n\nLa Vie is the quintessential locals' place.  La Boulange on the corner is much larger but often mobbed.  The justifiably famous Ritual is just up Octavia (in the heavily trafficked park area), and the more famous Blue Bottle kiosk around the corner on Linden.  If you want a full(er) menu, La Boulange is the only option.  For really gourmet Third Wave artisanal coffee, I don't think you can beat Ritual and Blue Bottle (matter of personal preference; for me, BB is the winner), but the lines can get outrageous at times and neither offers any indoor space to chill or work or study.

The wi-fi connection was horrible and unstable.  \n\nI liked how they let fresh air in but then so many people started smoking by the door that the smoke entered the cafe.

If the two cafes were characters in a comic book, Momi Toby's would be an ethereal character with a penchant for long, lazy conversations, staying out way too late and smoking too many cigarettes, and Cafe La Vie its arch nemesis.\n\nStill, for how modern it is and laptop-obsessed, Cafe La Vie manages to have some soul.

And I'm not talking mini-mart coffee or Starbucks but rather, cute, unique coffee shops, like this one. In an effort to get to know my new neighborhood (and again, in an effort to effectively telecommute) I started wandering through Hayes Valley and came across this gem. While small inside, it has great outdoor seating, and the front wall of windows open up so that even inside eaters can feel like they are outside (or, as the case maybe, inside office space can be outside office space too!). I didn't have coffe, but I did have a cookie and it was very good - breakfast of champions. Likewise, the guy at the counter had a great music selection going - very hipster but not distracting. \n\nNote: This place DOES have internet access - it's not secured and didn't show up at the top of my available wireless list. You might have to scroll down a bit, but it's there with a good signal.", "author": "Jenna G."}

The guy behind the counter could not of been nicer, which is always a rare thing in the early morning.  There were tables outside where we sat and enjoyed the beautiful San Francisco sun.  All in all it was a great experience and seems to be an awesome addition to the Hayes Valley that I only wish I had discovered sooner.", "author": "ELIZABETH W."}

They took my fav off the menu- chai with a shot of espresso but they'll still make it.  Figured out the trick- ask for regular, not soy milk and it's way less sweet.  Love the sidewalk seating and the free wifi.", "author": "laura a."}

It is super small and in a cool off the street location on Octavia. I have not had a bad experience here and my hag/wife lives across the street so if I end up in her bed instead of mine it is a good thing to wake up to since I feel like shit and dont remember how I got to her house kind of way, who is that sleeping next to me.

She seems to be friendly with all of the regulars and essentially just makes the small space cosy and pleasant. Today I went in and saw a man leaning against a back counter, berating the cashier. The cashier started to say hi to me and was interrupted by the jerk in the back, who was yelling at him to adjust a credit card tip while he greeted me. The woman who had tipped was waiting for two espresso drinks. The jerk asked how much the tip was. Weird, a little tacky. The cashier tried to talk to me and the jerk again yelled, \"what about the lady's coffee, you're f***ing up, you're too f****ing slow.\" Damn. I don't mean to throw this around, but I am a cafe manager, and this was the worst \"training\" I've ever seen. It made the whole place feel tense and awkward. I ordered a sesame bagel with tomato. I got home, and there's no tomato, which I'm pretty sure that I paid for. Basically, I like this place, but the jerk has gotta go.", "author": "Isabel L."}

There is a fireplace and it was nice and cozy in there. Local art on the walls is always a plus. My caramel mocha was amazing and my boyfriend enjoyed his iced mocha. There was also good light, which is a must for me. I was super grossed out by the people who brought their dogs in with them to order and the fact that the barista didn't say anything about it. However, I don't know if she actually noticed because she was pretty busy and it unfortunately seems to be normal for San Francisco.
