Singing in front of a large crowd scares the bajeezus out of me, which is why when I get invited to true karaoke spots like Pandora, that's a usual decline on my end.\n\nI took my friend to a nearby Chinatown bar and on our way there we noticed a group of people singing inside Bow Wow. We thought to ourselves, \"wow those people actually look like they are having fun.\" instead of the typical SF bar scene where it's crowded like a tin can of sardines and full of tech bros and tech h... you get the point. Most SF bars I find are clones of one another -- nothing singular about, much like the people of SF -- all Patagucci athleisure-wear dwellers. \n\nI like Chinatown bars because the true locals come here and those who want to have a more diverse crowd of people. Bow Wow is a simple dive bar with karaoke near the back. It's unapologetic and doesn't try to be something it's not.  \n\nThe beers are also stinkin cheap. $10 for 2 beers. Mind you a majority of these patrons were white but I love that they were drinking Tsing Tao or Tiger! And gringos karaoke way harder than asians. When the song \"Africa\" came on, no one really knew that song it was until the chorus and then we all sang our hearts out. I've never had so much fun karaoking. Music really brings people together and is the glue of our social fabric. Definitely coming back here with my amigos!", "author": "Connie M."}

I was looking forward to grabbing a few drinks with friends and singing some karaoke. We gave a card to open a tab and were told that there was a $20 minimum for card purchases. This was a little steep but we were planning on having several drinks anyway so we figured it wasn't a problem.\n\nThe place was almost empty. This was in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and out of maybe 20 or 25 barstools, only 5 were occupied when we came in, all by the same group. Our group of 5 sat on the opposite side of the bar closest to the karaoke. Still plenty of empty seats. \n\nAbout midway through our first drinks, the bartender named Cindy made a snark remark to one of my friends for drinking water. We let Cindy know that she was our designated driver and that the rest of our group would drink plenty of drinks to make up for it. This didn't stop her. She proceeded to yell at our group in Cantonese then began talking about us to the other group that was there, all of whom were Chinese. That group then also proceeded to yell at us in Cantonese. One of the members of our group is Chinese and she understood everything they were saying. They called us all sorts of inappropriate names. It was an extremely uncomfortable experience. All of this because our designated driver refused to drink alcohol. \n\nI understand if there was a line out the door and we were wasting bar space for other paying patrons, but the place was literally empty besides us and that group of 5 people. There was no reason for Cindy to make any comments. Anyone with an ounce of business logic would know she'll make more money with our group there than with our group not there and those seats remaining empty. In addition, what would've been a nice and healthy tip became an average tip.\n\nI see all the reviews about this older Mamma Candy lady and they're all glowing and positive. I think they need to go back to her because Cindy is doing this business no favors.", "author": "Joshua T."}

But she was just as rude and racist making bad comments in chinese about my daughter  because she was only drinking water. Saying she is wasting the bars space...and the bar only had another 4 or 5 patrons. She also incited the locals saying racist comments and did not realize my girlfriend speaks fluent mandarin and Cantonese and is actually chinese, last name Xu. When my gf spoke up she then made nagative comments about her being with an American. I do business and have supported the Asian community for more then 20 years, I am a member of Asian Real Estate Association of America and Chinese Real Estate Association among others. I was in the area for the Miss Asian Global Pageant as a sponsor. That should tell you how wrong she was threatening us that the chinese in the area wouldnt want us back.

It's about as divey as you get in here - the lighting is dim, there's no tap, bathrooms are single stall, and there's just enough space for the bar counter and a single walker to head to the bathroom. But, what can I say? I'm a sucker for a straight dive, and there aren't that many left. Sure, there are no taps, and liquor selection is limited, but you have what you need, and drinks are cheap. The bartender (Momma) also pushes drinks your way and feeds you plenty of free peanuts and pistachios.  Honestly, you just don't get this kind of vibe anymore in San Francisco.

The other spots down the street get all the hype(Li Po and Buddha) and deservedly so, though I will argue Li Po has fallen, more on that later.. This should all be about Bow Bow which should translate to Miss Candy's 15 seats of joy and happiness. \n\nAs you've probably seen from all the other reviews there is no bartender more revered than Mama Candy and when you meet her you'll feel the same way.  Sure you might at first glance make fun of her look or her accent but if you do you'll regret it once she welcomes you with open arms. If she doesn't do it with her charm she'll do it with her whiskey or complimentary nuts (no pun intended). \n\nOn top of having an amazing bartender which is always a pre-requisite for every elite dive bar. They have the other two covered (in my opinion) which is bad lighting for selfies and complimentary snacks you'd never eat anywhere else. Her pistachios keep you drinking till you forget what time you even walked in there.

Forget your swanky lounges in SoMa, this place is unique, quirky, gritty, divey, and has character, and is also tucked away on the outskirts of Chinatown.

If you're tired of paying $12-14 for cocktails at a lounge in North Beach, come into this place for inexpensive drinks, karaoke and complimentary peanuts and pistachios.\n\nIt wasn't super crowded when we came here on a Saturday night, but it's pretty long and narrow, so it's not great if you come with 6+ people, since you will be either in the back by the karaoke, or towards the door and it may be hard to all talk. Also, probably not the best for a first date.\n\nThere is only one bartender (Candy), who I also think owns the place - she will tell it like it is, pour you a stiff drink, and if it's your birthday, she may give you a free shot of Patron and take one herself (at least this was the case for my friend). \n\nIf you want to come hang out with a group of friends for a low-key, unique experience that is a bit off the beaten path, come here for a fun night.

Here's five reasons:\n\n1. Much like myself, She doesn't sing, she just drinks.\n\n2. If you're buying a round of shots in her vicinity, you have to buy her one too. I think that's a good rule when it comes to me too. \n\n3. I hear she can be a bit aggressive at times (a friend of mine may or may not have gotten in a fistfight with Mama Candy at one point, but they are cool now). Sometimes I fly off the handle. You don't even know about me.\n\n4. She will simultaneously scold you for not ordering enough booze, but also insist that you drink another glass of water. Drunk, but hydrated; that's my motto.\n\n5. You'll never win an argument against either of us. She will throw you out of the bar at 2 am. But even if you point out that her clock is 20 minutes fast and that it's only 1:40 am, you're still wrong.\n\nBasically identical twins. If you're in SF and I'm not, just go chill at Bow Bow.

We have to trade our Heelys for sensible cap toe oxfords.  We have to trade our wizard wands and lightsabers for 401Ks and mortgages.  We have to trade our fairy tale endings for the deepening sense that maybe the best years of our lives are already over.  \n\nOnce in a while, if we're very lucky, something or someone will bring that spark of magic back to life.  We start to believe again in a brighter, happier future.  We start to think maybe good things do happen to good people.  We start to wonder if North Korea isn't all just some kind of obscene practical joke started by the South Koreans.\n\nGoing to Bow Bow Cocktail Lounge brought that magic back into my life last night.  As soon as I walked into that tight, cramped space and was blasted in the face with the overpowering smell of incense, I knew I was home.  \n\nBow Bow is a dive bar, but it's so much more than that.  It's hallowed ground, run by a wonderful woman named Mama Candy (I believe it's a self-chosen nickname) who throws down absurdly cheap drinks with a heavy hand and a crooked smile.  Every drink is accompanied by a bowlful of peanuts and a plate full of pistachios.  I have no fucking idea how she makes any money at all, given how ludicrously expensive pistachios are.  \n\nThe walls are full of random Chinatown bric-a-brac, the lights are dim and neon-lit, and everyone inside is having the time of their lives.  This is all helped by an old-school karaoke machine in the back, which comes with terrific 90s stock footage of white people running on the beach and looking at each other.  \n\nThis is a place where dreams really do come true, provided your dream is to sing a loud and off-key version of \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" to a room full of judgmental strangers", "author": "Kevin C."}

That's all cool and super lovely UNTIL you want to sing your heart out.  The machine she has set up plays a guessing game with your selections.  Maybe it will come out in English, maybe in Catonese and maybe not at all.  Mama Candy don't care.

More like a wow, what an incredibly unpleasant woman, how does she still have a job kind of way. The drinks aren't particularly cheap (I think Anchor Steam is $6), and it's the absolute worst song book in the city. Mama has been known to coerce drunks into paying for her drinks. You have to stand right by the bathroom door to perform. So why do I go there?\n\nBecause if you get there early enough in the evening, Mama isn't there. Because in those early evening hours, especially on weekdays, you'll find older men singing \"He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother\" in a barely intelligible manner, but with all the feeling you could possibly give that song. Because they have quite the selection of outdated Chinese propaganda ballads, and I like the videos of the patriotic factory worker longing for her soldier boyfriend. Because I like danger, and when the songbook says \"Creep\" but doesn't say whether it's TLC or Radiohead, you're really taking a chance (it's TLC, by the way).\n\nSo, yes, I love Bow Bow.

Candy Wong's has an out of nation feeling and definitely owns some of that electric energy.  We noticed this upon entry when we saw 30-40 Asian men chain smoking cigarettes and karaoke singing Cilene Deon and canto-pop. We were immediately asked to leave in Cantonese, but soon after were allowed to stay because we ordered Patron.\n\nWe thought we were entering just so we could smoke while we drank, and soon were in line to sing \"Come to my window\" and \"November Rain\".  As we watched each Canto-Pop song get sung, we made another friend and collectively think that by the point we were too far gone to remember we were indeed invited back. Candy Wong herself, the proprietor, once seeing the financial opportunities in our short stay, made us sing a song somewhere lost in the female singer songwriters of the 80s. We agreed, and sang to one more Patron and to be honest we forget the rest of the night.", "author": "Alex L."}

Bow Bow was one of our last stops of a long day, which included drinking in the park and enjoying the beautiful weather, bar hopping downtown, eating in Little Italy, a roof top party... and I'm sure a few other things that I can't remember from drinking whiskey all day. Anyways, some friends of friends insisted that we go to Bow Bow for some drinks and karaoke. It's a chill, little dive bar. The drinks weren't as cheap as you might expect from a dive bar... Jameson was like $7. After a few songs, something went wrong with the microphone causing a lot of feedback from the speakers. We queued up \"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\" by Otis Redding and spontaneously the whole bar began singing it aloud... I don't think I've ever heard a better collective rendition. Good times!

The best part however, was that he didn't intend to save my job.  His intent, when he stopped playing our song requests and instead played songs that were clearly not karaoke, appeared to be to get my drunk ass friends and me to, at the very least, quit torturing everyone with our \"singing\", and quite possibly to get us to leave the bar.  Mission accomplished! Not only did we stop singing, we went home.  Woo-hoo!\n\nThus he saved my job --- instead of continuing to sing, drink, and smoke (WTF?!  I don't smoke!  I have asthma --- which means he DID save my life!) until closing time on a Wednesday night and be hung over and most likely late for the 9:30 a.m. meeting with my manager this morning, I went home around, uh, sometime earlier.  I got enough sleep & water to recover sufficiently to get to work early and finished the spreadsheet I needed to present to my manager at this 9:30 meeting.  \n\nFor that alone I would give 5 stars.  Additionally, unlike the Mint where karaoke appears to be an American Idol wannabe purgatory filled with aspiring Simon Cowells, the other bar patrons were quite, well, quiet.  Except when I told them to applaud the fact that I'd stopped singing.  Not applaud my singing (I was quite clear) but to applaud the fact that my singing had ceased and their ears, for the moment, were spared.  I would also give 5 stars for these gentlemen doing just that --- and doing it pretty exuberantly.\n\nMinus one star for the lack of ABBA & Madonna songs (Take A Chance On Me and Like A Prayer --- that's it?

Maria D., Darla C., and laura b. are all REAL dive bar pros, so they may disagree with my assessment. But I would definitely place Bow Bows in the true old school dive bar category. \n\nI don't know why my dear friend Julianna loves this place and insists on going every Valentine's Day with a group of women to belt out \"he did me wrong\" love songs. The place smells of an unwashed frat house dance floor, rotten eggs, and throw up. The endearing alcoholic that runs the ancient karaoke machine, Fulton, works in exchange for drinks and enjoys singing The Doors songs every hour or so. The first time I saw him take the mic in his own hands and saw his song choice (Break on Through), I thought, \"Oh dear Jesus, what kind of fool is this diminutive Asian guy going to make of himself?\" And then out of this broken man's body comes a voice better than any LA cover band I had ever heard! The man can SING! \n\nThe mistress of the bar just nods to the music and keeps Fulton liquored up, but gets suddenly snappy when people get up and suck. It is the one and only time I have ever been \"gonged\" and I can tell you that it is wildly humiliating to be out shined by a jim morrison-loving alkie who can barely stand. The proprietress also practically kicked me out when she realized that I was only drinking water (a rare detox phase I had a few years ago), even though I was tipping. \n\nSo even though I'm not really popular at Bow Bow, it still holds a spot in my heart for, almost Tao-like, staying true to it's dive-y nature.", "author": "Gretchen T."}

I only frequent the bow bow every couple months or so because I always get way too drunk (or I'm way too drunk before I even get here) and embarrass myself singing Karaoke.  \n\nYeah I know, your thinking, \"so what, that's what karaoke is all about.\"  Well, let me tell you something, when I'm at the bow bow I always think 'i know' a song pretty well and then know nothing but part of the bridge before the chorus.  Yeah, I don't even know the chorus.  Like 'La Bamba'.  I have these drunken illusions that just, you know, come over me.  So, most of the time when I mention that we perhaps stop by the bow bow I am almost always shut down by whomever I happen to be with.\n\nI do enjoy when Folsom gets going on the karaoke.  If he's resistant to your pleas, just buy him a whiskey.  \n\nSometimes there are really obnoxious drunk people who will straight dominate on the karaoke..and sing Metallica.  It doesn't happen too often, but its been known to happen.\n\nI like the video that accompanies the song selection.  Its like late 80s/early 90s, and its a mix of shots from famous landscapes (Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate Bridge) interspersed with little snippets of video of these like, Eastern European women.  Yeah its kind of strange.  I also enjoy how each song track is the like midi file of the original.  Like an electric keyboard.  You also have the option of singing your selection in English, Filipino, Mandarin, and Korean.\n\nWhat also happens when I go there is that I order a beer and a whiskey.  Then, somehow, that same shot glass is in front of me all night, and I know I've been drinking them because I'm drunk, but the glass remains full.  When it's time to leave I am presented with a bill for $80.  Its this phantom pour thing, she gets me every time. \n\nBut I must say, Candy takes care of ya.

Beware of body odor.  The first time I came here, I thought I was going to puke - until I put back 5 or 6 drinks for 20 bucks.  Then it was fine.\r\n2.  Beware of the creepy guy sitting at the bar next to the boiled nuts who just stares at you.  Or put back 5 or 6 drinks and you'll cease to notice the creepy stare.\r\n3.  Beware the boiled nuts.  At first you think, ewww, boiled nuts.  Then you throw back 8 or 9 drinks and you think, YEAH!  BOILED NUTS!  \r\n4.  Beware of the bartender.  After I had about a dozen drinks, I went to close out my tab, and the bartender was rather pleased with how many drinks I had purchased and then bought me another drink.  I clearly did not need another drink at this point.  \r\n\r\nBest part, when I checked my credit card balance, my bill was only $85 even though I had purchased about 20 drinks (not all for me, just mostly for me).\r\n\r\nGas rating: 5\r\nOkay, body odor counts as gas.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for seedy bars, but I have been spoiled by karaoke at the mint so I wasn't quite expecting the seedy creepiness of the bow bow (i could have sworn it was called \"bow wow\") when a friend recommended  we take our dinner party down the street to \"a great karaoke bar.\"\n\nThe bartender was WASTED. And playing some kind of chinatown dice game with some of the patrons. I'm not sure what the game was, but the main point of it seemed to be slamming the dice cups as hard as possible down on the bar, evaluating the outcome, and drinking shots WITH EVERY ROLL. How this woman was standing, let alone serving drinks, is beyond me.\n\nThen there was the crappy karaoke machine with the totally unrelated background movie of a young Asian woman doing Random Happy Shit. Twirling umbrellas in poppy fields, romping at the seashore, etc. while the engrish lyrics scroll across the screen. It also grades you on, apparently, your ability to shout read the lyrics exactly as they light up. I admit to not being the greatest singer but really? A 47? For Ray Charles? Not only does it grade you. It has some kind of evaluation along with it. Mine said \"Carry On\" - which I can only assume is some kind of polite translation of \"Get moving! Next!\" \n\nThen there were the old drunken men trying to grope any poor girl who started singing. My friend actually had to swat one away like a fly. Some industrious young man actually grabbed him and insisted that they gay slow dance together in order to get him out of my friends face while she did a \"Pretty Good Singer (74)\" version of The Rose. \n\nWhen I asked some lady about where the bathroom was I got this broken English reply: \"It is through that door. Here is The Thing - do not be afraid. And return quickly.\"\n\nExtra stars for the cheap booze and the amusing mis-translations in the song book. \"Hindstone Cowboy\" was my favorite.", "author": "Gabe S."}

She is absolutely hilarious! Mama San served us our Tsing Taos and concoted some fruit punch-like cocktails and when we asked what the total was, she just told us to buy her tequila shots! So, she got stinkin' drunk w/ us while chatting all of us up- telling me how she'd find me a boyfriend, telling us all how beautiful her kids are, telling us how beautiful we were, telling us beautiful this and beautiful that.. (i think she just likes saying the word \"beautiful\"?). While chatting away, she ends up knocking one of the cocktail glasses to the ground behind the bar (breaking it), and then shrugs it off, leaving it in its pile on the ground while telling us that it's no big deal since it's her bar. Nice!!\n\nThe most entertaining part of this all was trying to figure out what she was saying. Apparently my friend (who's a regular) told me the secret to figuring out her dialogue, is to first understand that she talks like Cartman from Southpark. Once you get that down, you'll start to at least get the gist of what she's saying. She's also got incredible hearing... she can be all the way at the other end of the bar w/ karaoke in the background, yet still manages to hear you casually mention to your buddy that you're ready for another beer.\n\nAs far as everything else goes, the place is the smallest bar I've ever been to, with a flat screen in the very back and patrons belting out karaoke tunes at the t.v. It's not the cleanest, w/ peanut, pistachio & sunflower seeds scattered on the floor, along with the fact that they allow smoking inside, but given that it's a dive bar, it's pretty much what I expected.\n\nSo swing by and sing a couple songs & take a few shots w/ good ol' Mama San!", "author": "Tiffany M."}

He'll tap you on the shoulder surreptitiously---like he's about to unveil his kidde porn collection---and then he quickly takes a cigarette, holds it to his nostril, inhales, and then blows smoke out of his mouth.  That's worth something... just don't know what.\n\n2) This place draws a varied, random assortment of folks.  Two nights ago, a middle aged man insisted on singing \"My Funny Valentine.\"  But when the music came on, he just stood there, looking blankly, as the ring-tone style music played on and on.  He turned to aforementioned karoake dude and pleaded that this was the \"wrong version\" of the song.  So, another version of the song came on and ... he stared blankly at the screen again.  The best thing was, that besides my booing, no one seemed to notice or care.\n\n3) I diagree that this dive bar is \"cheap.\"  I think Bud Lites are $3.50, which is not outrageous, but not great either.

The selection of karaoke songs is limited, but at least there's nooooo line to sing (the place is too small to make for a big line).  This is definitely a place where you'd want to bring your own crew to.  We did my birthday here last weekend and Momma made sure to keep me rolling in the Patron, and we were singing all night long.

This is a total dive bar with one janky karaoke system in the back and really what more do you need in life. My friends and I got down to business singing Peter Cetera, Heart, En Vogue and some Carpenters for good measure. We thought we were doing pretty well and then crazy bartendress lady picked up the mic and busted out like she was Chinese Celine Dion. Girl can sing!

They say as times get harder, people look for increasingly inexpensive ways to entertain themselves.  Well, if you want to go someplace unpretentious, to have a few drinks with your friends and get up on the mic and sing really bad karaoke then this tiny, smoke-filled room, just off Broadway in Chinatown is what you're looking for.  The hostess, Candy, is fun and engaging, and she'll even slam a drink or two with you, if she likes your style.  Quaff your beverages and munch on copious salty snacks while you wait your chance at karaoke stardom.  And no one will mind when you butcher one of your favorite songs.

I-S-S-U-E-S, with capslock on. she was checking out her busted visage in the mirror wall constantly, yelling at candy for random things, and muttering to herself about \"this bar is so odd...where am i anyway!?\" she brought in a taxi driver who needed his fare for taking her somewhere and, upon her return, she went looking for joe cool in the aviators. he was in the restroom, so she went banging on the door, telling him to come out, and positioned the cab driver, like a present, in front of the door. it was surreal. when the woman demanded $7 from joe cool to give the cab driver, he told the cabbie to \"get the hell out\" before he knocked him out. thirdly, a few minutes after this, candy decides she wants to bang the gong. loudly. frequently. no idea what she was saying, but she was wearing the best \"i'm wasted\" smile with her eyes closed during the ordeal. fourthly, the karaoke machine had to have been found at a garage sale - the visuals of sunny mountain landscapes and lake vistas which partnered songs like iron maiden's MIDI version of \"can i play with madness\" was not to be expected. i think i did a triple take..\n\neach of those events were powerful enough on their own to make me love the bow bow, but combined like voltron, they were an unstoppable force ingraining this business on my psyche like a nightmare you want to keep returning to. oh, keep your eye on how much you drink - since candy gets wasted, your bill may or may not be representative of what you realistically consumed. also, it's tiny, so huge groups can be hard to manage. \n\ni'd come here again, but not for at least six months or so. i'm not sure how this could possibly be a regular joint for anyone..", "author": "Jeremiah W."}

Just know that much and you'll have a good time here.  Candy, the proprieter/bartender is great if you can understand half of what she's saying.  Folsom is the old man who is the resident \"DJ\" if you would.  He sings the best Ebony and Ivory (and he's a chinese guy) as well as some Bruce Springstein songs.  If he was 30 years younger he might have a shot at American Idol.  Drinks aren't dirt cheap but karaoke is free, however you usually have to put in your request early and not mind waiting.  And usually so many people will want to sing with you that if you ever want to sing a song solo, don't come here.  Also, don't sing the romantic songs here.  It will bring down the mood to this place like someone's puppy died.  If you can speak mandarin, a few words goes a long ways here.
