And the soup had a bit of umph that disappeared in a flash. Spoonful after spoonful through fresh vegetables - carrots, onions, potato, celery and even bits of fresh avocado - as well as good sized chunks of chicken meat and rice, I was searching for that elusive satisfying bite. Never found it.\n\nBesides the tortilla that came with the soup, I did enjoy the complimentary warm house tortilla chips with pico de gallo salsa.\n\nMaybe I picked up the soup far too early in the day so the flavor had not had time to meld together from all the ingredients? But darn, I was so disappointed that my fond memory has been shattered.\n\nWould I be willing to try Pancho's soup again? \n\nYes, I would. But next time I'll keep in mind to stop by later in the day and hope the cook had the foresight to set the pot rolling with the soup early and that he remembered to season it well.", "author": "Joanna T."}

Yesterday I ordered a beer and fajita burrito. The cashier charged me for a water when I didn't order it, no big deal she gave me cash back for it. She kept the receipt to show her boss she had to refund me $4. My burrito when I got it was shrimp not steak. The following day I noticed 2 charges on my acct. I called my bank they did verify I was charged twice. I informed them I would be going to the restaurant and ask for cash back otherwise I would dispute the charges. \nI get to the restaurant the 2 ladies cooking completely ignored me when I walked in and saw me waiting to be assisted. 3 times I had to ask of someone would help me? Both ladies after I explained myself kept saying \"wait for the manager\" one of the ladies doubted I was there the previous night. I showed her a pic of myself and friends at the restaurant. She zoomed in all around the pic to make sure it was there location. I showed them the charges from my bank too. Finally the actual manager showed up, he told me they got a new credit card machine and I could have up to 4 charges. Really?? In what country? The conversation escalated into an argument. I had to tell him \"let's call the cops to get this resolved!\" He was rude, arrogant, kept telling me when a business gets a new credit card machine customers could have multiple charges.

The carnitas inside the taco were tasty and the taco shell was more unique than your average tortilla.  I'm a fan of crunchy tacos, and these were on the softer side.   Not too much going on with the tacos unless you visit the salsa bar and load it up. The salsa bar is similar to other businesses, hot/med salsa, pico de gallo, a mix of cilantro/onions, jalape\u00f1os, or a green avocado sauce.\n\nYou'll either love or dislike the borracho burrito.  The bbq sauce inside throws a different flavor at you that might not be what you're looking for.  I personally would not get it again.  I like traditional grilled/marinaded flavors.  Also, I love normal Mexican rice.  This place seemed to go with the chipotle train and has what appears to be white rice.   \n\nOverall, the food wasn't bad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-01", "description": "Taco Tuesday Review #1 needs to go to my neighborhood joint which I have frequented many many times.  Pancho's Salsa Bar is a fine place to get some Mexican food, particularly to-go, if you are living on this stretch of Polk Gulch.  It is also exceedingly unspectacular - which you can evaluate in different ways.  Unspectacular isn't necessarily bad.  It also means that this is not a place that you go out of your way to visit.  I have visited many times, though, because it is not bad at all and has a few nice features going in it's favor.\n\nSo, Pancho's is a chain but I don't believe that it is a big chain.  This location is on Polk Street as it transitioned over to the truly Nob Hill and then Russian Hill end of The City.  Pancho's is a pretty casual place with a nice vibe.  The food it pretty run of the mill, more on the end of a fast casual with a few entrees.  I think the menu is pretty limited relative to a more traditional Mexican place.  They have Burritos, and the options are listed out based on meat choices.  Same with Tacos.  Meat choices are Steak, Chicken, Carnitas and Shrimp.  So, not the big range.  They also offer about a half dozen entrees, such as Rolled Tacos, Tostadas (really should be called a Taco Salad), Tortas, Soup, Enchiladas and three combo platters.  All in all, not a ton of options.  You can't add a taco on the side.  The prices are in the $8/9 range for the Burritos and the $11 range for the entrees with meat.  \n\nI find the food to be a little bland and uninteresting.  Not bad, though.  I enjoy getting the Tostada (Taco Salad) even though I'd prefer less filler.  Rice in a Taco Salad?  The Burritos are just alright, however the Boracho Burrito with the sauce included it pretty tasty.  One of the Pancho's signatures is the homemade tortillas - I think that the Tacos are very bland, even with Guacamole.  You can load up at the Salsa Bar and flavor up your food if you want.  They have a nice little Salsa Bar.  One thing I will say is that I love that they always offer a $2 Tecate while you wait for your take out.  And again, the environment is nice enough.  I'll also add, I do have a few friends who like this place more than me - I'm not quite so crazy about it.  To be fair, you won't get awful food here, they have decent standards.  Just, not super interesting.  \n\nAll in all, I would not seek out the food, but I am happy to get it to-go since I live a few blocks away and this is the nice end of Polk Street.  But, I'd prefer the folks at El Super Burrito a few blocks closer to the Loin for food that is much more down home and flavorful.", "author": "Adam S."}

The latter was my approach. \n\nAfter placing my order, I was given a good portion of chips and made my own salsa selection at their self-serve salsa bar. Their pico de gallo and medium salsa are both colorful and full of flavor. Not overbearing and too hot. I was served my Sopa de Pollo which once again was generously served with shredded chicken and an assortment of vegetables. The meat was cooked right and seemed very fresh. The flavor of the soup was good and not on the salty side, which can indicate that it has been sitting in the pot foe a while\n The vegetables and potatoes were just right. The Steak and Shrimp burrito in a wheat tortilla was huge! Again the flavors of the black beans and its condiments welcomed you to a  Mexo-Caribbean experience. The shrimps and steak were balanced throughout the burrito and even though there was more beans than shrimp or steak, the flavors never waivered. All in all, it was a great meal and the place is clean and lacking that usual kitchen or bathroom smell that can ruin a meal.

It certainly looks the part - I love all the vintage signs. There's even an autographed picture of Jose Iglesias next to my favorite table. Service is generally friendly (with rare exceptions) and prompt.\n\nFood-wise, they do certain things very well here. I like their carnitas burritos and their fish tacos. The tacos are served on uniquely thick handmade soft tortillas, which I don't get often enough (because I'm so obsessed with burritos). Their chips are also great - light and crispy and not too oily. I like the salsa. Sometimes I wish they had more varieties, but the ones they make are good.\n\nI have enjoyed their breakfast dishes, but it's important to read and comprehend the ingredients carefully before ordering. Otherwise you might end up with a huge plate of eggs scrambled with lots of sliced jalape\u00f1os (meaning that, even if it's too spicy, picking out the peppers doesn't make it much less spicy at all). I like spicy food but that one was a little beyond me. (I still ate the whole thing, which says something, though probably more about me than the restaurant.) Again, I urge you to read the menu at the counter carefully before ordering breakfast. The breakfast burrito is a good choice.\n\nI actually avoided this place for a long time because the first thing I had there, their chicken burrito, didn't taste like much. (I still don't recommend it.) My only general complaint is that some of the meats just don't have a lot of flavor. I almost never order carne asada so I can't recall if it's good. But the carnitas and the fish are reliably tasty. The food is definitely consistent. There are also a lot of menu items I simply haven't tried due to my aforementioned burrito obsession. Overall, it's a good value and a decent burrito just a few blocks from home, so I'll keep coming back.", "author": "Jason G."}

I didn't get the guac, but it looked super fresh.\n\nOfferings: Typical authentic Mexican fare...but wait! They have vegetarian burrito...filled with not oily disgusting veggies, but steamed veggies. And my favorite veggie of all - squash. So burritos, tacos, salads, tortilla soup...just imagine typical Mexican fare and you've basically imagined the menu.\n\n\nPrices: Prices here are super reasonable. Portions are large. \n\nService: As with your usual hole in the wall, lots of people were in line and only two people were in the kitchen. Be prepared to wait a little to order and for your food. \n\nSo Pancho's (Salsa Bar and Grill). Not only do you deliver on the \"salsa bar\" promise, but the taste as well.

Seating was decent and the decor was pretty neat to take a gander at. It did take a bit longer for my order to come out while everyone ordered theirs at the same time (paid all together pretty much). Well, got to say that the wait was worth it. Had the bowl of Sopa De Pollo. Veggies were perfectly cooked where it melts in your mouth. Potatoes did the same and the rice at the bottom weren't overcooked (just right). Prices were pretty average (more or less a tad bit more since I live up in North Bay Area so totally understand the price difference between a bigger city and one that's a bit smaller), but worth it for some authentic Mexican dishes.

I didn't really like the name of it personally, sounded to me like one of those taquerias down south that's made by a bunch of white dudes who would prefer French fries in their burritos. But we walked in and found it was the real deal, with some funny decorations on the wall that all fit the atmosphere.\n\nI pretty much always order enchilada plates wherever I go for Mexican food. But something caught my eye this time. Hand made tamales. It didn't matter what else I read, I knew my decision was already made. My homegirl got the fish tacos, which also had handmade tortillas. Both plates were delicious, but the tamales were the real fucking deal. So moist and delicious pork inside. And it came with this green salsa on the side of the plate that is simply fantastic. Tremendous plates.\n\nThe salsa bar is pretty good, I was expecting more for it being made multiple times daily. Pico was good, the green salsa was a bit sub par, kinda watery but I'm gonna chalk it up to being like 10pm when we walked in. The red salsa had to have been one of the hottest salsas I've tried at a Mexican restaurant, most places don't even offer shit this spicy.", "author": "Jim B."}

I'm used to go at night, but today I decided to have lunch there for the first time. \nWhat a horrible experience. The place was packed and the guy that works there was really rude with me in front of everyone. \nI wanted to get the Combination #3 that comes with cheese quesadilla, a small burrito and guacamole. I asked him what comes inside the cheese quesadilla because every Mexican restaurant does its dishes in a different way. So instead of answering my simple question, he replied with \"what you just said? What is the kind of quesadilla you just said?\". And I asked him again \"what comes inside of the cheese quesadilla?\". And for my surprise he relied \"you've just said cheese, right? What do you think that comes inside of it?\" \nWHAT? Was that real? So I told him I DO know what cheese is and that I just wanted to know if the quesadilla comes with anything else inside, specially because I am sensitive to certain foods. And after I said that he completed with: \"do you see anything else written there? So NO\" \nThat was the meanest thing that have ever happened to me on a restaurant.\nSo I yelled at him saying he was REALLY RUDE and left the place. I will never come back to that place again. They just lost a customer that goes there at least once a week!", "author": "Fernanda D."}

Pancho's is located just a few storefronts from Bob's Donut, and if you follow my reviews you know that I go to Bob's religiously.  I was in the neighborhood for yet another donut craving (now it's the jelly ones!) so I figured why go home and cook?  I decided to grab a donut or two anyways for dessert then headed over to Pancho's for dinner.\n\nThe interior inside this restaurant is very festive with all sorts of trinkets hanging on its walls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qSq-m4LRu3PAfroD-LKJg?select=NQXFjOyDIAczDC8jOBUSDA).  Let's face it, if you go inside and you're feeling really bored studying these walls, looking at the trinkets and reading all the unique signs will alleviate any symptoms of boredom.  At least that was the case for me.\n\nYou order at the counter and your food is brought to you.  That was my case.  I noticed later with other patrons that their number was called and they had to go to the counter to get their food.  Either method works for me.  If there's food waiting to be eaten I'll get to it one way or another.\n\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas with the mild red sauce.  I had eaten a chicken burrito with spicy green sauce from another restaurant earlier that day and the fiery green sauce was still wreaking havoc in the background.  Pancho's mild red sauce is tasty and very, very mild with just a hint of chiles.  My chicken enchiladas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qSq-m4LRu3PAfroD-LKJg?select=U4yl_-SieUH_JMR6EthRpQ) were ready with very little wait.  The enchiladas are served with rice and black beans and garnished with a little shredded lettuce, a sprig of cilantro, a single tortilla chip and a piece of radish.  A shredded cheese mix of cheddar and jack cheeses was melted on top of the enchiladas but not the beans.  I would have preferred the cheese be melted on the beans also. You can heap salsa onto your food at your own discretion at the restaurant's salsa bar.\n\nThe enchiladas were stuffed with lots of white meat chicken.  The chicken meat was moist but quite bland in taste absorbing only the taste of the mild red sauce.  The homemade cornmeal tortillas were also too thick for my preference.  I would have liked a thinner tortilla.  The rice had a very subtle seasoning in it but much of it was clumped together.  That kind of reminded me of eating leftover rice.  The black beans were good.\n\nWhile filling the enchiladas really weren't what I had hoped for.  I'll be back on another night to try something else from the menu.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It seems that every time I come here, which is not often because of this reason, I get the woman who cashiers only until she reached me and then all of a sudden, she turned into...a server, a bus person, delivery person, etc. \n\nFor example, on my last visit which was yesterday, she stopped taking order when it became my turn, and told me, \"just a minute\" and then started running around and do stuff like refilling the salsa bar, get ice, deliver food to the tables, getting this from the kitchen, that into the kitchen, etc. And then finally, when she's back behind the counter, I thought she was going to take my order, but nooo...she started doing something else again. So another lady from the kitchen came over and started taking orders because now the line is getting really long.\n\nIf they are so busy, why don't they hire another person? Anyway, aside from that, I find them ok nice but weird. If it wasn't for the fact that I was craving Mexican food, I would have walked out because I am a bit impatient.

What I love most about Panchos is their tortillas, they are hand-made, and are simply delish - I don't think I've ever had tortillas made this tasty,  and in every item on the menu you can really taste the fresh ingredients put in to make the tasty items.  \n\nI highly recommend the daily specials, as they are always a hit.  \n\nCase in point:\n\nThe other day during the lunch hour, I made a special trek to Panchos and was so happy to see something different on the daily specials menu.  \n\nIt was their Tijuana Tacos and they are not your average Tijuana tacos.  The ingredients included tender steak fajita, saut\u00e9ed sweet peppers, roasted potatoes, chipotle sauce, fresh cilantro and pico de gallo.  I am sure I am missing something, but God those tacos succulent and delicious.  Writing this review, I am craving them right now.  \n\nHere is a little insight and is something I've learned over the years; don't be in a rush, especially during the lunch hour.  The ladies, God bless them, who cook in the kitchen tend to be on the slow side and do a lot, and I mean a LOT of gossiping (I understand a little (pico) Spanish).  And they are quite humorous in their discussions; but not on days when I am in a rush (like weekdays during my lunch hour).  \n\nSo due to my assessment, I have devised a different strategy in that I order and pay, then head out to make use of the time and do other errands in the hood.  I come back 15 minutes later and Voila! My lunch is ready and I am on my way back to work.  \n\nMy only gripe is sometimes they forget (and I should know better by now) to complete the order, that is, if you order something outside of the norm, say a side dish of rice and beans, sometimes they forget to include these items in your to-go bag.  \n\nSo this is something I need to keep in mind when ordering - before leaving check my bag to make sure I received everything I ordered.  8^)", "author": "Cris B."}

It goes without saying that Nick's Crispy Taco's was presented to me within weeks of moving to SF, and I love it, but I wanted to try something else and see what else I could find.\n\nThe ambience is much preferable to Nick's or many other taquerias; it has nice designs on the wall, many tables, and a helpful and cheery staff. The food came out relatively quickly, and was served with some chips, but only like 8 literal chips - king of annoying. The salsa bar is nice and high quality (I really liked the green salsa quite a bit), but you have buy an extra thing of chips to really take advantage, unlike some other places that give you enough side chips for free to enjoy the salsa.\n\nI ordered a Borracho Burrito after reading some other Yelp reviews. I found the sauce to be interesting if nothing else, but a little too re-inventing the wheel for me. I couldn't really taste the cheese or guacamole, although the tortilla and meat were spot on. In general, I thought it was pretty good and different than a normal SF burrito, but nothing earth-shattering, if you ask me. Disappointing too because it is more expensive than El Super Burrito on Sutter and Polk, which offers unlimited chips/salsa with your burrito, and is more expensive than two Nick's crispy tacos. Again, I liked the salsa alot, though. I might come back next time and go to town on the salsa, order something more traditional, and enjoy the nice vibe of this place. \n\nIn general, I'd say Pancho's is definitely worth a swing-by quick lunch, and a good business to support helpful and cheery staff, although don't expect a life-changing meal in any context.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I found their burritos mediocre, giving them at least two or three tries with each one faring no better than the previous. In the end, I was more than prepared to consider Pancho's another wart on the anus-flesh that is Polk St. \n\nAnd then I tried their tacos... which have only just become my FAVORITE thing about my neighborhood. \n\nI don't know for sure, but on the subject of their taco tortillas, I'm willing to bet some little Mexican grandma is out there rolling and pounding these little bits of bliss into fruition. I can practically taste that smothering, latino-mother love in each bite.\n\nAnd where else can things go but up once you drop a small pile of deliciously seasoned carnitas on top? Hand me a Mexican coke and call it a day motherf***er I'm SOLD!\n\nSo back to my quandary... I very much adore their tacos, and indeed they are now a regular part of my increasingly shameful diet, but I must concede it's just plain wrong when people hand out a five star rating because a restaurant happens to do one thing very well... but perhaps my aversion to a five-star rating in this situation runs deeper... \n\nPerhaps I can't give it five stars because I often say rude, judgmental, borderline ignorant things about people who freely dole out a lot of five-star ratings.

I failed to notice that the burrito comes with lettuce, which is my pet peeve in burritos- I think it's hideous. But it was my fault that I didn't request the burrito without lettuce, so I won't hold it against them. \n\nWhat I will hold against them is the fact that the \"grilled steak\" tasted like dog food. It had this distinctive, very unappealing scent that immediately turned me off. I ate 1/3 of the burrito because it actually took me awhile to reach the steak, but I gave up soon after. I'm still shuddering thinking about how gross it was.\n\nThe one thing that doesn't seem like a total Yelp-lie is the yummy fresh tortillas. I ordered one on the side and it saved me from my butt-rito. I can't understand how a place with such quality tortillas can serve such shameful burritos. Both me and my boyfriend were bummed.\n\nSalsa bar was okay, although only two were actually tasty. 3 of the 4 were very watery. Chips were fine, but Nick's (down the street) serves stuff that's WAYYY better.\n\nYeah... I'd never come back here.

On my first visit I ordered a Borracho Burrito with steak and without the salsa. (Grilled chicken or steak in a homemade Mexican BBQ sauce with black beans, rice, salsa, cheese, and guacamole in a chile tortilla.)  I liked it so much that I went back the next day and had another one, this time with a side of sour cream which nicely cut the spice of the BBQ sauce just a bit without making it completely bland.

I decided to try something different and got a grilled chicken Quesadilla on corn tortillas.  Oh my god.  Their homemade corn tortillas are so delicious!  Now, this quesadilla might have disappointed some people, since it contained only grilled chicken, cheddar cheese, and jack cheese, but, given my aforementioned lightweight status, I was very happy with it.  (For those of you who can handle more heat, there's always the option of dipping it in one of the salsas from their salsa bar.)\n\nThe place is small, so it can be a bit difficult to get between the tables when it's really busy.  Also, getting to the bathroom requires one to go through the kitchen, which I always hate doing because I feel like I'm in the way of the kitchen staff.  I'm not factoring those things into my rating, just noting them here for the benefit of others.\n\nI wouldn't compare the food here to that of a taqueria in the Mission; I think they're somewhat different beasts.

I saw a few restaurants that had the item on the menu, but I wanted a real Mexican joint type greasy ass chorizo potato deal. i stuck it out an extra hour and walked in at 10am. It was stellar. Each burrito comes with a nice size side of freshly fried tortilla chips and the salsa bar is well maintained and clean. \n\nCame back a few days later and asked the register gal what was the best burrito. She suggested the carnitas and it did not disappoint. Not the best one I've ever had, but very good. I always hold the rice with burritos, and even without that waste of a filler, it was huge. Stuffed with pork, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato. Bomb. I really liked the salsa verde and medium red salsa too.", "author": "John L."}

What a huge mistake. \nFirst off, the line was very long and the restaurant understaffed, the cashier was also putting together orders and bussing tables. But that wasn't a huge deal to me, it gave me time to look at the menu, and I was very excited about going back to try lots of the items. \nI wasn't surprised by the long wait to get my to-go bean and rice burrito.. Until I realized that numbers ahead of mine were being called. And not only that, people that  had arrived after me were already finished EATING their meals. I went to the front to ask and they said that they had lost my ticket but would get right on it. Now, I work in customer service, I know, shit happens, whatever. By this time it was about 2pm and I was kind of annoyed that my super quick trip got so dragged out, but I just wanted to get home and eat. \nUnfortunately, when I got home I discovered that my order was messed up, and the burrito had NOTHING on it besides beans and rice, even though the menu clearly states lettuce, salsa, cheese, whatever.\nSo now I was pissed off. I walked back down to the restaurant and asked for a refund as calmly as I could, and they tell me that it's not possible. NOT POSSIBLE? If I don't eat your food, how is a refund not possible?? They offered me another burrito done right this time, and even though I was angry I decided to take it because I'm still fucking hungry. It is now 3pm and I'm finally sitting down to eat this damn burrito.\n\nIt is not delicious at all, even chipotle could do better, seriously.\n\nThe best advice that I can give after this painfully long, unsatisfying experience is for you to go to Nicks. It's right down the street if you're already in the area, and there's a much higher chance that you'll actually get what you order. And then enjoy eating it.

A look to the bottom of menu brought Curlyfro to tears. \"What - a SMALL burrito??? Can this be for real???

They're just \"eh.\"\n\nThe Borracho burrito though is awesome.  They put this so-called barbeque sauce in it, which mixes in perfectly with the black beans and rice to create a kind of gooey, oozy mound of deliciousness surrounded by the meat (I recommend carne asada over the chicken, but you can request carnitas too), cheese, and guacamole.  And the best part about it all is that they wrap it in a \"Chile tortilla\" which tastes incredible, and never comes unfolded, gets torn, or otherwise let you down and make a mess while you're eating.\n\nAs a testament to how good this burrito is, I went on a Pancho's binge a few months ago and ate at least 3 Borracho burritos a week for dinner for about a month.  I'm not joking, I would come home, sit on my couch, try to resist the craving, and end up going to Pancho's to get it.  I even tried eating terrible Trader Joe's frozen burritos for lunch to rid me of my burrito appetite for dinner, and that didn't work.  Finally it was the fact that I'd gained 5 pounds that made me think twice about basing a large part of my nutritional intake on the Borracho burrito.

It isn't mission mexican, but it is serviceable. Then the other day I see they are serving mole enchiladas for $8.99. So I order cheese enchiladas with the mole sauce, but the total is suddenly almost thirteen dollars. I ask why so much?\nUsually, the total is just under eleven dollars for cheese enchiladas, which are $7.99 on the regular menu, plus my drink. I expect the total to be a little more because the sign says mole enchiladas are $8.99, but still it seems pretty expensive, so I ask why so much?\nThe guy says that mole sauce is $1.50 extra. So, I point at the sign that says they are $8.99 and he says that price is for chicken only, and that if I order cheese enchiladas that it is a $1.50 extra, which makes no sense at all to me because cheese enchiladas from the regular menu are $7.99. So I'm already paying a dollar extra for mole sauce even though $8.99 is the regular price for chicken or beef enchiladas, and they are still $8.99, even with mole sauce.\nSo I ask, for clarification. He is basically trying to charge me $8.99 for $7.99 cheese enchiladas, plus $1.50 extra for mole sauce because I'm not ordering chicken? He says yes. I say no. I'm not paying extra, twice, for something that costs less on the regular menu. Especially since the advertised price for mole enchiladas is the same as the regular price for chicken or beef enchiladas. That just makes no sense at all, no matter what the extra charge might be. They don't charge extra depending on if you want red or green sauce.\nWell, way to go amigo! You just lost a customer! I'll get my mole in the mission, where it doesn't cost anything extra, but only for cheese. And my lunches? Well, there is no shortage of places to get lunch along Polk Street.", "author": "Pause P."}

Where they too lazy to leave the kitchen and ask? I have a good friend that is allergic to poultry what then? \n\nThis was unacceptable, just come out and tell me before you make the food. I might have just ordered something else.", "author": "Dani Z."}

I broke down today and gave it a shot.  This place is embarassingly bad and I absolutely cannot believe that this place gets decent Yelp reviews.  I started with the tortilla soup.  The lady behind the counter told me that I could not have avocado and cheese, only one or the other.  Very strange.  I opted for the cheese - this was the first time I'd ever had tortilla soup without avocado.  Not to worry, though, because no avocado could have salvaged this \"soup.\"  The soup had so many tortilla chip strips in it, that you could barely get to the broth - the texture was compaprable to an oatmeal.   Truly nasty.  Then came my enchilada combination platter.  Oh boy.  I had asked for one cheese and one chicken enchilada but they had told me they could not accomodate such a request and that I would need to choose one or the other?  Really?  Why?  That's strange.  Don't you make these to order?  No.  They are pre-made and frozen.  Lovely.  Literally the worst enchiladas I have ever had -- hardly any cheese, awkwardly hard tortilla, I could go on.  The beans and rice were terrible -- black beans, barely warm with a tiny bit of cheese sprinkled on top.  I think the moral of this story is simple: If you want to eat here (why for the love of god would you do such a thing?) you should just go with a burrito because it's impossible to screw up a burrito.  Alternatively, you could get down to the mission and eat good Mexican food.  It's somewhat ironic that my favorite and least favorite Mexican food spots in SF both have the word \"Pancho\" in their name.  \n\nOne positive: The chips were good.
