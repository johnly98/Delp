We would walk by, drive by, and have wanted to come for YEARS!  The restaurant is often full, and several times, we've tried for walk in but to no avail.  \n\nToday, we once again were wondering where to dine for dinner and thought of Rue Lepic once again.  We called the restaurant and we're able to reserve for 6:30!  So excited!!  \n\nFrom the moment we walked in and greeted by Marco's bright smile and warm welcome, to tasting Chef Michiko's wondeful food and also greeted by her (LOVE, LOVE, LOVE chefs who come out from the kitchen and talk to diners!!!), to tasing our desserts and walking out the door full and satisfied... our experience was excellent from end to end.\n\nWe learned that Rue Lepic has been here for 37 years!  AND, the Chef Michiko and Maitre 'd/ waiter / do-it-all amazing Marco team has been together for 35!!!  Even marriages don't last this long!   But this wondeful duel amazes me...  with a 2pp team, they're able to execute everything seamlessly.  From timing the food perfectly, waiting for patrons to come back out from washroom, to picking up plates and refilling water.  Nothing was missed or delayed.  Amazing!!!  \n\nWhat makes dining here so enjoyable is especially Marco... I still remember his bright warm smile.  \"Thank you very much\", I would say.  And he would say \"you're welcome very much.\"  It's not just the words but his upbeat, bright, warm smile.  You can tell that they truly enjoy their jobs here.  \n\nDuring our dining, Chef Michiko came out from her open kitchen to introduce herself.  Asked us how we liked our food... we loved it(!!!) and proceeded to also welcome other tables.  So rare these days are chefs who still\ntake the time to greet customers.  I truly enjoy this restaurant.\n\nOk, now on to the food:\n\n* Rack of Lamb\nWe heard that the rack of lamb is excellent here so 3 out of the 4 of us opted for this dish.  It's one of the best i've had....  juicy, tasty, well seasoned, and moist and tender.  Highly recommended.\n\n* Creme of Vegetable Soup\nCame with entree... very tasty.  Not overly creamy or salty like many places.  You can taste the vegetable and I love the small kick in spices to make this soup spicy.  \n\n* Seafood Pasta\nEverything is perfect about this dish.  The el dante pasta, the excellent sauce covering every strand of angel hair, the well seasoned seafood.  Perfect.  Well, except maybe the dish is too small... lol\n\n* Caesar Salad \nGood solid caesar salad  \n\n* Fresh Garden Salad\nExcellent garden salad - usually this is the house, blah, bland salad but not at Rue Lepic.  I would opt for this one instead of the Caesar\n\n* Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e \nSO GOOD!!  One of the best I've had .  It's mild, it's fresh, it's light and the creme is not overpowering . All around excellent!!\n\nWe're so happy we finally dined here and can't wait to be back.", "author": "Winnie W."}

It has been around for around 30 years and one of those rapidly disappearing San Francisco neighborhood restaurants while trendy places take over.\n\nThis place isn't large, perhaps a dozen tables tucked closely together.  It is showing its age, but consider it patina.\n\nThis was the second time I've been here and similar experiences both times.  Both times we came with friends.\n\nWe had a reservation and were seated right away. The restaurant seems to have a steady clientele and some were know by the staff.\n\nI started with the escargot appetizer, served without the shell on capellini pasta and a sauce.  It is delcious and well worth trying, for its unusual presentation alone.\n\nWe all got asparagus soup and it too was excellent.\n\nWhat I admired is the French bread they serve-.REAL French bread, with a very light flakey crust that crumbles easily.  You don't find it very often in these parts.  The only downside is you each get a couple pieces, no more.\n\nMy main course was the duck l'orange. It was tender in slices with a brown sauce poured over it.  We all agreed that the true test of good entrees is the quality of the carrots when served.  These were excellent.\n\nWe ordered wine and everyone enjoyed the entire meal.\n\nThis appears to be a family operation where they all work.  The kitchen is open to the room so you can see everything if facing it.  The woman cooking appears to have it all down to a science.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, but do get harried sometimes too.  Don't come if you have time constraints.  Things move at its own pace. It seemed like a long wait to get our entrees, but we didn't mind.\n\nI would definitely go back.  It's a good place to eat and a remaining vestige of long term neighborhood restaurants in the City.", "author": "Tom B."}

Its a small, cozy place so definitely make a reservation and wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people. Open kitchen which smelled amazing. In short, definitely coming back again for the five course Prix fixe with lobster tail. \n\nAtmosphere - 5 stars. Whole vibe including how friendly the servers were is warm and cozy. Nice but not overly fancy or stuffy. \n\nService - 10 stars. Our server was friendly and fun without being too much. Servers are attentive but busy and with one chef, pacing was leisurely (we got the five course Prix fixe which took about 2 hours). It made for an awesome date night with a lot of time to talk/catch up but just go in with the right expectations and make sure to allot enough time. \n\nFood - 4 stars. We did the five course Prix fixe which was $62-$67 depending on your entree. In general, everything the chef touched was delicious (seafood pasta, soup, entrees) and everything else (salad, dessert) was average/good but nothing special.  Appetizer sized portion of seafood pasta (AMAZING), soup of the day (we had something green that was also amazing), caesar or garden salad, entree (lobster tail was amazing, duck breast was okay) and dessert (creme brulee and cheesecake were okay). \n\nDrinks - Don't know enough about wine to rate but they have a limited menu of domestic and imported wines and the one we ended up with was good.", "author": "Sarina Y."}

Probably because of the high expectation, I can only give a four star here. We are in a meat state lately, so despite of the great reviews on the chef's menu of the seafood pasta, we ordered the filet Mignon and roasted veal chop. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked, it's great but within my expectation. The vegetables on the side was standard, the sauce was a little overwhelming but good. However, the veal chop was a little disappointing, it's a bit dried up and over cooked. The side vegetables were exactly the same as the filet mignon, feels a little redundant. It's the standard of Ruth Chris Steak House, but with a special little French restaurant in nob hills area in San Francisco, I was expecting a little more. \nThere are so many great french baguette in the world, but the house bread here tastes and feels like days old bread being reheated inappropriately. Hope this is not consistently so. \nThe soup of the day was asparagus soup. It's too salty and plain at the same time. Nothing special at all.\nOver all it's a good meal within my expectation.

The seafood pasta (angel hair pasta with scallops and a light tomato-based sauce) was very tasty, the soup (vegetable with pureed potatoes, carrots, leeks, and spinach) delicious, and the salad crisp and fresh. There's a choice of house or Caesar for the salad and both were excellent. I had the duck a l'orange which was outstanding - just the right amount of sweetness - and a nice portion. My husband had the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce and it was very tasty and cooked exactly as he requested. Nice variety of deserts - I had the mixed fruit with creme Anglaise and my husband had the cheesecake. Both were the perfect finish to the meal. Add in a reasonable bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and it was a memorable meal!", "author": "David C."}

Actually, it's that Epic. \n\nI visited with my mother and aunt, and we all ordered a different dish. All entr\u00e9es were served with cauliflower soup. Let me begin with the soup - it was amazing. Pur\u00e9ed cauliflower soup seasoned to perfection and had me restraining myself from licking the bowl. Luckily I was able to sop it up with the delicious bread provided. Our fabulous waiter provided us the perfect recommendation for wine to pair with our meals. \n\nNow to the entr\u00e9es. We are all lovers of food and well traveled. My aunt described her salmon as being the best she has ever tasted - we all agreed. My duck was cooked to perfection with an orange sauce that was a little sweet, a little savory and every bit amazing. The steak a poivre was just as amazing and rivaled any I have tasted in France. I again had to restrain myself from licking my plate. \n\nThen dessert. Oh my. Chocolate ganache with strawberry and kiwi sauce. The ganache was approximately the size of a golfball, and I thought to myself 'There is no way that will be enough for the three of us'...it was so rich and delicious we didn't even make it halfway through.\n\nTakeaway: I will happily drive 3 hours into San Francisco to eat at Rue Lepic, and then drive right back home. It's just that Epic!", "author": "Krysta S."}

No.  But it isn't cheap either and for the price and quality there are so many better French restaurants in San Francisco.  \n\nCons:  \nButter is blah - not homemade which most true French Restaurants prepare\nBread is not worth eating and yet it's a FRENCH restaurant \nDuck a l'Orange was way over cooked.

Having passed our party animal prime, we opted for the early (6 p.m.) seating.  Everything was excellent - service, food, and ambience.  The five course menu featured soft shell crab in meuniere sauce, cucumber watercress bisque, smoked salmon salad, a choice of lobster tail or filet mignon, creme brulee or chocolate ganache with creme anglais, and a glass of sparking wine.  I am normally not a fan of soft shell crab (I prefer fresh dungeness), but it was very tasty and the meuniere sauce was delicious (we requested more bread to sop it up - we're not proud).  The bisque was rich, yet refreshing, the smoked salmon salad was perfect.  The combination of salmon, endive, and avocado worked very well together.  The lobster was tender and the filet mignon (ordered rare) was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful.  The creme brulee was a creamy burnt sugar delight, but the ganache (the ganache!) was over the top yummy decadence.  The service was friendly and efficient, but not obtrusive.  And the owner came by each table and chatted with her guests.

Our French in SB is Bouchon (not related to the Vegas one to my knowledge but it may be) is extremely expensive but worth it on a special occasion (Valentine's Day, anniversary, birthday). \n\nIn New York, I go to Bistro Chat Noir, Mon Petit Cafe, Quatorze Bis (once). The Upper East Side boasts many excellent French restaurants, not the least of which is Sel y Poivre, an old neighborhood family-owned bistro. It's extremely reasonable--the bargain prix-fixe of the Upper East side for dinner--28.95 for entree, appetizer and dessert! \n\nBut my CT friend who traveled to SF for business a lot at one time always ate here. Just at the bottom of Nob Hill, down from the Mark Hopkins on 900 Pine Street, it's teeny tiny with unusually beautiful and comfortable chairs and tables close together. \n\nI was absolutely astounded by the food and the prices, far lower than I expected for a place of this caliber. It's 30 years old and you don't survive in the cutthroat restaurant business if you aren't exceptional. \n\nIt's owned by a charming older Asian couple and frequented by a combination of locals and well-to-do tourists. One man came in by himself and ordered a Caesar salad (the best I've ever had, utterly perfect dressing, plenty of shaved cheese and tons of anchovies for just 8 or 9 dollars), a glass of wine and a dessert. \n\nI was shocked by the size and we were lucky on a Friday night during our mini-vacation to San Francisco for the Afghan Whigs show at the Fillmore (review of this legendary venue forthcoming) to get the last table for two at 8PM. \n\nMy boyfriend had the filet with cognac peppercorn, a generous cut of meat with some potatoes underneath. It was exquisite and entrees come with a cup of soup. The soup of the day was cream of vegetable, just a hint of cream, with a wonderful flavor. \n\nI never send things back due to temperature but the soup was barely warm so they happily took it back and it returned quite hot. \n\nThe coffee was terrific and strong (I'm wondering if they serve my favorite coffee--Peerless--since that's a SF-based company) but if you demand scalding hot coffee say so when you order. \n\nJ had the best cheesecake I've ever tasted, far lighter than a New York cheesecake like he had at Cafe Majestic the night before. The creme anglaise was so good I could have had a cup of all by itself. \n\nBest of all for a place of this caliber, there are plenty of 8 and 9 dollar wines by the glass. In New York, it's gotten insane. 14 used to be the most expensive wine by the glass and now it's barely above average at a nice restaurant. \n\nHotel bars are notoriously pricey but at the Gramercy Hotel bar (admittedly great), wines start at 13 or 14 and to up to the low 20s. Same with the Peninsula. \n\nIt was an extraordinary meal and with an entree, two soups, a salad, coffee , dessert and one glass of wine just 75 before tip? \n\nI can't wait to eat there again when I'm hungrier\n\nP.S.: The bathroom is TINY. When I say tiny, I don't mean 3 or 4 feet by 3 or 4 feet. I mean it's like an airplane bathroom, just a bit longer. It's no big thing but it is a bit of a shock.", "author": "Victoria O."}

First we parked very close to the restaurant. My father parked in front and we parked less than a half a block away. Every single thing  this the group of six got was very flavorful,cooked perfectly and sublime. The chef has been cooking for 33 years and is incredibly sweet and gracious. The noise levels were not too bad either. It did take a while and was a little understaffed ,but it is a small business so I understand. Also ,I have celiac and was totally accommodated and provided with gluten free food which I really appreciated.\nThe chef is a true master of her craft.", "author": "Delisa S."}

I def wouldn't recommend this for a first date spot, because you may feel kinda awkward. \n\nthe service was not good at all, we were quite disappointed. it took forever to get our drink order, and then they brought us butter but no bread ... we had to ask for it twice. everyone that ordered an entree got a tomato-y soup before hand and she took mine before i was done with it. her attitude about everything was just kinda meh. \n\nthe appetizers were fab ... we got the escargot (it comes over a little pasta with this insane sauce. I highly recommend this) & the smoked salmon (comes over a bed of lettuce with capers and a sauce. I'd also recommend this). when we finally got our bread it was great as well!\n\nwe got a few different entrees but they all seemed to come with the same sauce which we all loved. A few of us got the chicken, it was moist and came with yummy potatoes and some green beans and carrots. My boyfriend got the filet and said it was cooked perfectly, medium rare. Another friend got the roasted veal and she loved it. no complaints on those \n\nwe had cupcakes waiting at home, so we chose to skip dessert ... but, it was my friends birthday so they brought out a little chocolate ganache with a candle and we all sang happy birthday. \n\nThe prices match the quality and taste of the food, so we all left happy... just wish they gave better service.\n\nFYI :: if you have to use the bathroom & are remotely claustrophobic, good luck.

So you can see for yourself that she prepares everything in the best way. \n\n We had a 6 course prix fixed meal. 6 courses for $87 plus champagne! What a deal! Everything was amazing. I was full by the 3rd course (I wore a skin tight dress which did not let my stomach expand whatsoever). I chose the lobster tail rather than the filet. They must have had alot of really big lobster tails (I heard the waiter mentioning it), but the thing was as big as a quart milk carton. Freaking huge! The champagne was amazing and they did not skimp on it. \n\nThe dessert was the best part. We had the creme brulee and the fruit cup (dunno what it was called). The fruits were all so sweet and fresh. It was drizzled with some sort of sauce. Mmmmm. The creme brulee was orgasmic.

Maybe the tourists will keep it going. \n\nSince it's often hard to figure out which reviewers know their food and which don't, I'll say which SF French restaurants I do like: Chez Papa and Zazie. (No, I haven't tried any of the really expensive ones.) Readers can decide whether my opinion is worth taking seriously. \n\nGeneral point: Food was overspiced, in some cases wantonly so. \n\nLentil soup: blended smooth, but had too much salt-and pepper mixture--left a harsh aftertaste in the back of the throat. \n\nLe Poulet avec Rosemary: again, overspiced. (The beans and carrots were cooked perfectly; small compensation.) \n\nHowever, the poulet was a miracle of restraint compared to the Filet Mignon, which had been drowned in Worcestershire sauce. I think I outgrew this style of cooking in fourth grade. Maybe fifth. Had we not been in a rush to see our show, we would have sent it back.  The cut of meat was not particularly flavorful, either. At $32, this was a huge disappointment. \n\nBottom line: if you want mediocre food before taking in a show in the theater district, save your money and go to Lori's Diner. \n\n(Of course the service was pleasant, but I've never seen the point of giving and withholding stars based on service.)", "author": "Nat C."}

I licked the plate with their perfect baguette. \n\nWe were in the city celebrating my friend's 40th birthday. So we partook of the chef's menu. I began with the seafood pasta. I am going back with my hubby just for that alone. Then the soup special was butternut squash. Dude. One of my favorite squashes. I ordered the scallop dish. It came with perfectly cooked asparagus, carrots and I kid you not, butter masquerading as potatoes. I love them. Scallops, veggies, butter... love. To cap of the evening I picked the passion fruit mousse. Yes. YES. YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!\n\nThat is all.\n\nOkay, a little more. At the end they provided a bit of nougat and dark chocolate to put you over the top.\n\nThe restaurant is in gorgeous Nob Hill. Just a short walk from the fabulous Huntington Hotel.

We had reservations at 7PM, but didn't get seated a little after our reservation, It's understandable with the restaurant so packed. We were seated within two feet of the table next to us. Very cramped. It was dim inside the restaurant and we could hear the conversations going about us. I didn't expect it to be so loud inside. It was a little hard to flag down our server, and we noticed that the couple near us also had a hard time flagging down the same server. \n\nWe ordered from the $49 Chef's Menu. We were served with bread and butter to nibble on before our courses arrived. The Seafood Pasta was delicious. I always forget to tell the waiters to lighten the salt in my food, since I like foods with less salt. In the end, the pasta was absolutely delicious. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or the scallops in the pasta. There was plenty to go around. I originally thought the portion was small, but I learned later that all the dishes would fill me up. \n\nThe soup of the day was spinach soup. Though I am not a big fan of spinach because of the after taste, the soup was surprisingly creamy and tasty. Next was the Caesar Salad. I'm not a fan of salads so I'm going to have to skip that part because I'm biased. The entree I chose was the special. It was big scallops with potato au gratin with some greens. By the time the entree came, I was so full. It was a mistake to eat the bread and butter and the salad. Except for the little grit, the scallops would have been wonderful. The sauce for the scallops was very similar to the the seafood pasta sauce. The potatoes were also very flavorful. \n\nThe dessert was my favorite though. I got the passion fruit mousse with strawberry and kiwi puree (red and green for Christmas). The server got my order wrong, and gave me the creme brulee instead. But when it got to his attention, he quickly got me the dessert I ordered. The mousse was light and airy. Just tart enough, with a mild sweetness to it. When putting some of the puree with the mousse it was the perfect combination.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back.", "author": "Jay L."}

Quaint also describes the interior. While there are white table cloths, which I read as upscale, the restaurant is casual.  The space is a bit dated (with 80s pastel pink)--no fancy chairs or veneers, just an open kitchen (that, candidly, looks like it's from a diner).  That said (and I don't think being dated is bad), the food is good and you know it's fresh when you see the chef start up your order.  \n\nThe soup du jour is included and always good.  Today it was a pea/broccoli puree.  I recommend the escargot to start.  They're not over-done and rubbery and they're not drowned in garlic and butter.  The filet mignon is a good main, but you should know they sauce the meat, which could be considered a sin by some.  The sweet breads are also good.  The preparation doesn't include (the typical?) pressing before final preparation.  As a result, the sweet breads have a fresher mouth feel.  \n\nRegulars as well as newcomers are treated with care.  In the past couple of years, I've been a half dozen times and there's a smile and easy service for everyone.  There seems to be only one waiter.  He does try to get around, but when it's busy expect slower service and instead enjoy the street view.", "author": "QuodE D."}

We had reservations for 8 pm; one of our party arrived on time (we were about 10 min late) so we were seated immediately.\n\nWe ordered filet mignon au poivre vert, mackerel, and magret de canard l'orange (duck). All entrees came with rice or potatoes au gratin and a green vegetable, as well as a bowl of pureed corn soup. My filet was overcooked but had a decent taste, and there wasn't much duck, but our two friends enjoyed their meal. The star was the escargots saut\u00e9ed in garlic butter, parsley, and tomato sauce and served on angel hair pasta. The escargots were already removed from the shells. Excellent.

If that's your thing, the execution is good, and you'll love it. If it's not your thing...you'll be bored.  The courses -- salad, soup, entree -- are textbook French and well prepared. The soup (included with the entree) varies from day to day; we had cream of watercress, good but not extraordinary. The entrees are all variations on the same theme: protein over potatoes covered in sauce, vegetables on the side. The sauces are tasty and the meat is cooked very nicely but...it's not my thing.  I was bored. Having said that, I did like the Pernod shrimp salad, which had a nice contrast of cooked and raw ingredients, and was far and away the most creative item on the menu. \n\nThe wine list has both depth and variety and we were very happy with the Bordeaux we ordered.

And this particular binge of ours just happens to be sweetbreads. The organs of an animal you never would think of eating, I've only tasted sweetbreads with darker, stronger sauces. So, when we saw that Rue Lepic offered sweetbreads in a white wine sauce, we were sold!\n\nRue Lepic is quaint and small - veryyyy small. As in, elbow to elbow, hear-what-the-people-next-to-you-are-saying small. The bathroom seems like a converted closet (though pretty clean!). Decor is definitely a little dated. Not a great place for groups, either.\n\nThe service was nice and pleasant, but when it gets crowded and busy, it's a bit all over the place. They gave us the wrong entrees and I touched it with my fork but they took it away and served it to the right couple. Ooooooops.\n\nThe menu is very limited, to a handful of appetizers, entrees and desserts, each. They also have 2 separate 5 course meals you can choose from. This was probably the best choice if you want the most for your money BUT we opted to skip it because we wanted to try their appetizers.\n\nWe had:\n- Smoked Salmon Carpaccio: I saw them take the smoked salmon bag from the fridge. It was the same bag of smoked salmon you can get at any grocery store. Not going to lie, this sorta broke my heart :( When it came out, it was on top of a salad with an aioli sauce. Good dish, but I can literally go buy it at the store.\n- Flambeed Prawns Salad: Bf loved it; he finished the entire thing AND used the bread to soak up the sauce.\n- Roasted Veal: Good. I liked it but Bf thought it was just okay.\n- Sauteed Sweetbreads: I think I prefer a darker sauce but this was pretty good. Sweetbreads were soft and had a light, delicate flavor. Came with rice, which I didn't care for.\n\nI think one thing that was disappointing was that my dish and my bf's dish were pretty similar. The sauces were similar, the tastes were somewhat similar, the plating was similar.\n\nYou know the phrase \"you eat with your eyes first?\". If that's true, Rue Lepic is serving some cafeteria style food, seriously! Plating was truly nothing special and the sides were not great - string beans, carrots, jasmine rice?! I'm not 60 yet!\n\nI think my favorite part of the meal, besides the sweetbreads itself, was the bread and the free soup. The bread was soo good! Super soft and warm. And the vegetable soup was a puree of potatoes (I LOVE POTATOES) and others.

The host (waiter, owner, manager?) insisted in the corn soup was the best soup in the city and he might be right. The only negative was the caesar salad, which wasn't as green as I'd like and didn't seem overly fresh. The sauteed salmon was absolutely terrific. \n\nAs others have said, the place is very small and intimate, which lends itself to a very nice dining experience.

First off, a little bit about myself.... I'm a bargain hunter foodie and my goal in life is to find the best restaurants without hurting my wallet. \n\nSo back to my review. Rue Lepic has a five (5) course prix fixe menu that is less than $50. The five (5) course meal comprises of THE seafood pasta, salad, soup, main entr\u00e9e, and dessert -- I don't normally eat seafood but I made an exception with the seafood pasta because it is truly amazing. The salad is basic, the soup is pur\u00e9ed so you can't really distinguish what it is you're having only that you know it taste good, the main entr\u00e9e allows you to select from a variety of options (I always go for the Filet Mignon, which is always a good choice) and the dessert... oh the desserts... can't really pick the best one because they are all so good. \n\nThe restaurant has a very comfortable appeal to it. It's not like other French restaurants where you feel obligated to dress up -- don't get me wrong, you have to dress nicely, no shorts and flip flops, to eat at Rue Lepic because IT IS fine dining just without having to file for bankruptcy after dinner.  The service is wonderful and I love how they wait for everyone in your party to finish eating before serving the next dish. The staff is very friendly and you can keep asking for warm bread... I like the bread. :)\n\nThe only down side for me is parking. Parking SUCKS!!! I remember one time that my parents and I waited an hour and a half just for parking. I'm not a patient woman but that night, I was THE most patient person in the world. \nRue Lepic to me is two (2) thumbs and two (2) big toes up. Like I said, you don't have to pay a lot to get good food and service. :)  Happy eating!", "author": "Aura A."}

Soup is also very good as well. By the time I get my entree, Im actually already quite full. I actually would love to have seconds or thirds on the seafood pasta. \n\nAnd dessert, their peach sorbet is soo unique. I love how they put the sorbet inside the peach itself.

I was happy with my choice for that reason alone as it was raining on the evening in question and neither of us felt much like venturing out. \n\nI was actually quite impressed with this place. The atmosphere itself isn't very inviting, I have to admit, and the tables are extra cozy. But the menu is straight-up French bistro and the service is actually quite nice. The wine menu, as mentioned elsewhere, isn't massive but the bottles they do have are very reasonably priced. My dining companion and I both ordered the chef's menu.\n\nThe seafood pasta starter was delicious and a nice little portion. The soup - a generically described \"vegetable cream\" the night I dined - was also a delicious little course, delicately flavored and a nice velvety texture. The salad course was the weakest; the Caesar salad featured flaccid and overdressed greens and haphazard chunks of parmesan. They need to rethink the salad course a bit; a bitter greens salad would be a more welcome component to the meal. Maybe some arugula or mache.\n\nThe main course - in my case, a red snapper special - was delicious and well prepared. It was slightly over-sauced which masked the flavor of the fish and the sauce itself was very similar to the seafood pasta (think lemon-butter-herb). But I will say it was very tasty and while wasn't much of a looker, the flavors were pretty much balanced and what you'd expect from French cuisine.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the dessert. I chose the passionfruit mousse and was utterly impressed. It was tangy and tart with a great sauce and a lingering, almost faintly perfume-y aftertaste that is iconic of a nice passionfruit. A light and fantastic end to the meal.\n\nAll in all if they'd address the salad course and maybe freshen up the decor slightly it'd be a big improvement. Barring that I'd still happily dine here again; it seems from the reviews here that the meals are consistent from visit to visit and so is the service. The husband/wife team are very charming folks. On a cold rainy SF night, this little gem hit the spot and for that it gets four stars!", "author": "D L."}

Having moved away during college and military years, I was not able to return until recently. I/we were not disappointed. \n\nWe called on the same day for a reservation and asked for a late seating at/about 9 pm: no problem. The party ahead of us for our table was just leaving and the table was being cleared. This is a cozy, street corner property with windows facing on all points. We lucked out, our table was farthest from the entrance (so we had no foot traffic nor influence from the night time air. We were immediately greeted by our waiter and offered a wine list, water and bread roles. The menu is simple and traditionally complete for a boutique french meal.\n\nWe passed on a salad option for a first course and selected escargots. Not a mistake at all: we were very impressed. My partner then ordered chicken and I selected beef entre (per the online menu for the property). The property also offers a \"Chef's\" pre-fix opportunity if this is your thing. \n\nWe were delighted with the service and the portions - we just kept things simple as we had had a late lunch and wanted to enjoy eachothers' company and the activity within the dining room and on the street. \n\nThe only DOWNside: people at tables nearby were vocal enough to be a distraction. But such is the potential in tight quarters and/or an intimate dining location. Nonetheless, we did not care to hear about others' kids, their dogs, their frustrations. Otherwise, I would give Rue Lepic and HIGH 4.\n\nCouples (2 persons) or groups (up to 4 or 6) will be well treated at Rue Lepic.

You can tell that the majority of their business on a Saturday night are loyal Rue Lepic customers.  Crowd is definitely mature.  Decor is 90's dated but who really cares if your company is stimulating.  Service was very good and attentive.  You will not leave hungry if you order the Chef's 5-course menu.  I challenge you skeptical yelpers to find a better value at a nice French Restaurant.\n\nStarted with the Escargot w/Angel Hair Pasta.  Sauce was delicious, the Escargot were soooooo tender and probably the best Escargot I've ever had.  A must have at Rue Lepic\n\nSeafood pasta was very good, Soup was a vegetable puree - creamy but light.  I ordered the Veal w/truffle and mushroom sauce, wife had the boneless duck breast with orange sauce and mother-in-law had Roasted rack of lamb with a garlic and fresh mint\nbeurre rouge.  The veal was the tender and the truffle/mushroom sauce was rich but not overly heavy.  The duck was good, not amazing, but good.  The lamb was interesting, I don't usually like a sweet sauce with lamb but this one worked.  \n\nFor dessert we ordered the Chocolate Mousse, Passion Fruit Mousse, and Creme Brulee.  Going back I'd order three Chocolate Mousse's - decadent, rich, and mouth-watering delicious.

They have a 5 course prix fixe dinner menu (see Manabu M.'s ROTD 3/10) which is about $45 for 5 courses, and about $56 for lobster in the 5 course meal. \nWe raved about the shrimp pasta appetizer, it was followed by the Caesar salad which was over spiced with pepper (no anchovies). Had we known it was peppered, we would've refused more pepper when the waiter offered. \nThe corn soup was bland and watery. For entrees, we had a rack of lamb (good), duck (better than the lamb), fillet Mignon (good) and I really liked my sea bass, cooked just right in butter sauce with a delish scalloped potatoes, tender green beans with carrot wedges. \nDessert included a tiny creme brulee' (good), berry tart (I didn't like this one) and peach sorbet which BFF also ordered. The sorbet was wonderfully refreshing and filled inside a hollowed out REAL frozen peach which I took several bites of. Our bottle of French pinot noir was fruity and delicious, $28. \nWe've tried several restaurants in the area before a show and this one is my favorite. You should make reservations before or by 5:30PM to ensure a leisurely 2 hrs. to enjoy the meal before you make the hike up the hill to the Masonic.\nOur waiter was attentive but very busy as he's the only waiter in the entire dining room which holds probably a max of 22 guests.  A large portrait of the owner hangs on the wall next to the tiny unisex bathroom.  The bathroom is very small.  I think a 300 lb person would feel very claustrophobic in there as I was feeling sandwiched in as well.  I understand from the waiter that the restaurant has been there about 45 yrs.

Very hot (in temperature) and nice flavor with actual seafood in it like shrimps & what I think were baby scallops.\n\nCaesar salad w/generous shavings of parmesan cheese. Pretty good. I ordered extra dressing on the side after reading reviews that it was too dry, but it didn't really need more since it had plenty of parmesan cheese to flavor it. No visible pieces of anchovy, to my dismay, as I love it in my caesar salads.\n\nSoup of the day -- cream of cauliflower. Not my favorite veggie due to lack of much flavor, but it was nice in soup form.\n\nPicked the duck a l'orange entree and was slightly disappointed. I think a couple of outer slices were maybe a little overcooked as I found them chewy. Came with seasoned rice, asparagus, and carrots. Tasted my dining partner's choice of the rack of lamb & think I liked that dish better. Live & learn.\n\nDessert was a super-dense almost fudge-like chocolate mousse with some sort of creme w/kiwi & berry sauce, which helped balance the sweetness. Pretty darn good, not complaining.\n\nSo the food overall was good & I might go again in the future, trying other entrees or ordering a la carte.\n\nVery good service, water glass always filled, dirty plates taken away, etc. \n\nSmall place so the table are very close to one another.

Both were average at best.

My experience with Ritz took over 3 hours, so the 90 minutes at Rue Lepic was not even a nuance.  \n\nEvery time I had a special occasion to celebrate, I come to Rue Lepic because I know that everyone will have a blast.    \n\nPS.

The restaurant itself is small, with 10-13 tables and romantic lighting. I was instantly attracted to the prix-fixe menu- it's a fantastic deal! Not only is it on their menu regularly, you get 5 courses for only $45.95! I am not a big person but I pack a big appetite. I met my match with this meal! \nComplimentary bread and butter: crispy outside, soft interior and fantastic taste! We of course asked for more! \n1st course: seafood pasta that smells DIVINE! It included angel hair pasta with bits of shrimp and baby scallops and fresh cilantro. It was REALLY REALLY good and I would have been very happy if it was my main course.\n2nd course: soup. I learned it was a mixed vegetable soup. It was creamy, at the perfect temperature and scrumptious! \n3rd course: cesear salad. Classic and came with yummy croutons (probably made from the same bread we were served)\n4th course: HOLD UP! I must divulge something about the entree. Usually when restaurants offer a prix-fixe menu, they limit what entrees you can choose. Not here! You get to pick ANYTHING off the menu. They definitely get a star for that! I ordered the duck breast with orange sauce with a side of rice, asparagus and carrots and my bf ordered the grilled tenderloin with peppercorn sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both were YUMMY! \n5th course: dessert! Same thing here with the entrees- you can pick whatever you want! The table next to us ordered the fresh peach sorbet (really impressive looking but it would have been too cold for me). I opted for the chocolate mousse with creme anglais with strawberry and kiwi sauce. DELICIOUS! The chocolate was creamy and rich and the fruit sauce went so well with it.  \n\nAfterwards, we paid the bill and left. A woman who I'm presuming is the owner, graciously opened the door for us, thanked us and told us she appreciated us coming. How sweet is that?! We left with big smiles and full tummies. \n\nI definitely want to go back (I've already mentally picked my entree... I was eyeing the veal and the passion fruit mousse).", "author": "Amanda W."}

The beef was cooked medium-rare, as requested, and was of a good quality. I asked for the pepper sauce on the side, and it was on top of the beef. I don't know whether this was by accident or because the chef doesn't believe in making that kind of alteration. I'd only made the request because I'm on a very-low-carb diet and figured the sauce had flour in it. The dish was delicious, carbs be damned. The salmon was reportedly quite good as well.

The duck was tough, no crispiness to it, drowned in a very strong overpowering orange sauce, and the accompanying 'rice' had a very weird aroma, reminiscent of dirt, yes people, dirt. It tasted very odd as well, and when I complained about it, the waiter tried to tell me it was the spices, he mentioned cumin and turmeric, two spices I am actually very fond of. He then said he would taste it, which he did, and agreed that yes, it was very bad, and would I like some potato dauphinoise instead. My friends Filet Mignon was also not good. We did have some pureed vegetable soup, which was very tasty. Even the coffee was weak as hell. All in all a bad, bad experience, and certainly not one I could recommend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-02-03", "description": "I am so shocked by the 5 star reviews for this restaurant. There was nothing and I mean nothing good about this place. We were unable to get a reservation for any decent restaurant on short notice, so we decided to try this place. The restaurant is small, you are practically on top of the tables next to you and feel as if you are dining with them. It was very uncomfortable as the couple seated next to us were listening to our conversation the whole evening. There is one waiter and one chef. You may ask yourself how is this possible? It isn't. The waiter gave terrible service. Dinner took almost 2 hours, we ordered the tasting menu and had to request dessert and the check multiple times and ate dessert with our coats on rushing to get to our show. Which we missed the opening act (the show was a block away). The server absolutely ignores any attempt you make to get his attention, we had to get up and walk over to him multiple times. The busboy was the only redeeming factor as he was pleasant and kept our water glasses full. As I mentioned we ordered the tasting menu. I chose the lobster tail option, my bf ordered the filet with a peppercorn sauce. The meal starts with a french bread roll, clearly not house made. First course was a seafood angel-hair pasta. I can not tell you how awful this particular dish was. First of all, the dishes are clearly plated before service and warmed in the microwave for service. The plating is a disaster, a mound of overcooked pasta, with an excessively garlicky sauce slapped on top with mushy seafood bits scattered around. This was truly cafeteria style. It came to the table with literally tons of steam emitting from the pasta. There is no doubt it was microwaved. I found the dish to be inedible. The amount of garlic in it was not acceptable. My bf ate it, only because he was hungry. The waiter did not bother to ask if there was an issue with the plate even though it was clear I had barely touched it. The second course was a cauliflower soup. One word SALT. The soup also came out piping, steaming hot, it was also microwaved. Third course was caesar salad. This was unremarkable save for the fact the dressing was store bought. It isn't hard to make caesar dressing and is unforgivable to serve a generic sysco dressing at a supposedly higher end French restaurant. Next was the entree. My lobster tail was disgusting to look at. It was certainly not fresh, it's appearance was that of rubber or plastic. Dare I say it also could have been microwaved? I knew immediately I could not eat it. My bf was sweet enough to switch with me. He said it was bad. There was some sort of pureed something under both of our entrees (to refresh my new dish was a filet) I suppose it was a potato. One thing I should mention also is that the veg side is boiled carrots, al a old folks home or cafeteria style!! It's truly banal, truly bland, truly unmentionable. The filet was fine, but combined with the rest of the courses, not worth the price. Lastly, dessert. I had an unremarkable creme brulee and my bf had a fruit tart which came recommended by the waiter, but I suspect because it was several days old and they were looking to unload it. This place was a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I can't express enough how cafeteria this place was. From the terrible service, the awful plating, the microwaved dishes and the frozen seafood.. all of it was bad. Don't go here. Please.", "author": "jen w."}

My DH and I had a good friend in from out of town and we were looking for a place within walking distance of Union Square that had a neighborhood bistro feel. When we arrived there were a few tables filled, the hum of quiet conversation filling the air. \nWe perused the menu and wine list, waiting patiently for someone to come by. Our water glasses were unceremoniously plunked down on the table, and then we were left to our own devices. My husband tried to get the attention of our server who pointedly blew by and ignored him, instead busying himself with opening wine for a table which had been seated after us. I was beginning to think we had forgotten to switch off the Klingon Cloaking Device before coming in! At that point, with almost 15 minutes invested in this, we bailed. Immediately the two servers on the floor stopped and watched as we put our coats back on, shocked (shocked!) that we would even think of leaving. Our out of town guest answered their silent stares by stating the obvious - that waiting the amount of time we did with only having the water glasses being brought to us (and may I say the time lag was such that I even got a refill!)was rude. It was just as obvious to the kitchen staff what had happened, and while they were apologetic the damage was done. \n\nThis place had done nothing to make us feel welcome, including being bustled to our table by a host/server who clearly gave us the impression that we were an inconvenience.\n\nI can forgive an off night for the kitchen if the service is good and the staff is pleasant. But when the service and staff are already two strikes, odds for the third strike are too high.", "author": "Kelly M."}

As far we can remember, the menu is about the same as it was on our first visit - absolutely delicious!!  Although Adella was trained in France where she  mastered Provencal delicacies, and unlike many French restaurants that give stingy portions, you may have to ask for a doggie bag if you choose the five course Price Fixe dinner, which is what we would recommend.  My wife and I are both retired and enjoy travel and fine dining.  I believe that we have eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the Bay Area and elsewhere, but if I were asked to list my top five restaurants of all time, I would place Rue Lepic alongside The Elderberry House in Oakhurst, CA (five star) as my top selections.

Our table had four different main courses (chicken, lamb, beef, and salmon) all with different sauces. I have recently been diagnosed with gluten intolerance so I was a little concerned about the sauces, but our waiter said there was no wheat in the sauce for the chicken, but in fact would be happy to make my chicken with a lemon butter sauce instead if I wanted. They were very accommodating The cream of mushroom soup was great and thickened with potatoes. Dessert included a number of sorbets, and mousses with passion fruit and kiwi. This is a very small place maybe 15 tables. They have not spent a fortune dressing the place up to look WOW, but it was nice and clean. Just real good food. There is no bar, but a good wine list. It is just a few blocks from Union Square so if your staying around there it is much better than most of the places there. They had a great prix fixe menu, but we didn't try it this night.

We both ordered the salmon in dill sauce and it was mouth watering, the salmon was as fresh as it could be. Garden salad dressing was light and tasty with just the right amount of salt in the dressing. The puree of pea soup and hot fresh roll and sweet butter complimented the meal which was served in just the right proportion. We skipped dessert this time around because we'd already had a large lunch that day. We will definitely come back. The place was tiny but tidy, the only suggestions I would made is that the decor looks a tad tired and instead of polyester lace cafe curtains I would make them out of fine starched cotton with narrow lace edging. Tablecloths, chairs, etc all crisp, clean and comfortable. I thought the owner/hostess was darling. She resembles my adopted adult daughter who is Vietnamese/Black. Service was relaxed and timely and we felt we were served and attended to in just the right amount, no hovering, just attentive. Two salads, two entrees and one glass of pinot noir plus tax and tip came to $93.00 I don't know where else in The City one can get a deal like that.

As everyone said, the seafood pasta is a nice starter. The caesar salad was good. The soup of the day was something like creamed corn/leek. Was very nice. My fiance got the filet mignon cooked rare and he said it was perfect. For dessert I had the creme brulee with strawberries. It was actually just ok. I enjoyed it but the cream coulda been smoother and the berries were not very sweet. My fiance had the chocolate ganache with the kiwi and raspberry sauce.

The pictures, in retrospect, are deceiving, because they make the place look romantic which it is not.  Nothing romantic about being on top of the next table and the open kitchen smoke blowing all over the place.  I ordered the Chefs Menu. But being an escargot lover, I asked to replace the seafood pasta with escargot which our waiter was more than happy to do.  In fact, he recommended it.  But, I'm a purist with escargot and this one was plated with noodles, some crazy butter/tomato sauce and basically tasteless.  The salad was ordinary.  The lobster, while good, was not presented well.   Rather sloppy looking.  the dessert was forgetful.  I saw no French in the kitchen.  Basically your run of the mill hispanics but the lady had it down to a science.  I'm given it two starts because the host/waiter was very professional and has been there for decades.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-22", "description": "This is a cute restaurant, nicely located in Nob Hill area of SF.  We did not have a reservation, but were lucky enough to nab a table on Friday night after waiting 20 minutes or so. \n\nWe (party of four) were seated at a table close to the kitchen, against a wine rack that had to be accessed twice during our meal.  That meant leaning into/over the table while the bottle of wine was found by the server/host and pulled from the rack.  Two of our party could not get in and out without both of the other members of the party getting up and stepping away from the table.  We were inches from other diners and could hear their conversations word for word when we were not speaking to each other.  The restaurant is quite dark (with nice touches of candles on tables and around the restaurant), so reading the menu (for me) was a bit tricky.  The restroom was clean and nicely decorated.  \n\nThe service was really slow.  After reading the rave reviews about the service, I think it might have been a fluke for us.  It appeared that the manager/owner/host was also serving, so perhaps one or more of his servers did not show up that night?  Not sure, but we weren't in a hurry.  I think tables could have turned a little more quickly if service was a bit more attentive. We were there for 1-1/2 to almost 2 hours, and there were tables still occupied with people who had come before us. At least we weren't rushed.  Our server (or host/manager?) seemed a bit irritated with us when we asked questions about the menu, but then showed us a bit of humor later on in the dinner.  Our water glasses were always filled by the bus person, and warm, crusty rolls were offered.\n\nBetween the four of us, we ordered two filet mignons with green peppercorn sauce and the seafood special, a halibut in a lemon butter sauce.  The entrees came with soup.  We were first told it was cream of vegetable soup, then told it was split pea when it arrived.  It was definitely a green, creamy soup with a delightful flavor and was light - I'm pretty sure it was a mix of vegetables versus split pea.  We all loved it.  My husband ordered a green salad which was okay.  The filets were covered in a nice, velvety sauce (perfectly peppery) and cooked to order, but the meat was somewhat tough and fatty - very unusual for a filet mignon.  My husband and I split oneof the filets, and the server brought the plate out and put it between us.  Huh?  I used my bread plate for my portion of the meal.  My daughter's halibut was fishier than any halibut we've ever tasted, although the sauce was very nice - light, flavorful and rich.  The accompanying vegetables were well cooked and flavorful.  The highlight of the meal was dessert.  We shared berries in creme anglaise, a special dessert - a sort of fruit tart, and the peach sorbet in the frozen peach.  They were all yummy and refreshing.\n\nWe picked a bordeaux wine in which, about halfway in to our first glass, we all were disappointed.  That was our mistake.  \n\nOverall, we had a nice time, but I wouldn't say this is one of the best french restaurants we've enjoyed.  It really felt cramped - not like a cute bistro or European cafe.  It felt like they were packing as many tables as they could manage into the restaurant, so it was awkward and uncomfortable.  Perhaps tables near the window had more space.  The food seemed inconsistent and the service was lukewarm at best.\n\nWe'll try it again sometime.  It's worth a second try.", "author": "Casey N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-22", "description": "After yet another great meal tonight, I am compelled to let everyone know of a secret I've kept for years - Rue Lepic.  It's a girlfriend tradition - drinks at Top of the Mark, followed by dinner at Rue Lepic, for many years now.  As a former resident of Paris, I crave this little place: it's ordinary-meets-extraordinary, and not pretentious at all. There's a neighborhood-y feeling of welcome when you come in, and you're seated alongside neighboring tables in a convivial but intimate atmosphere. You're likely to see the Brown twins or other local \"celebs\" eating in, or just passing by and waving. Every meal comes with soup (how civilized!), and their silky soups du jour - winter vegetable, or cream of watercress, or  the like - are always SO memorable. Then there is your entree -- served not CA-cuisine-style, but French style, with a plate of meat, starch and vegetables. (This is not apparent when you peruse the menu, so be sure to understand that \"duck l'orange\" is not just duck, but includes veggies, starch and, of course, the soup.)  Personally, I recommend choosing from the regular menu as opposed to the multi-course Prix Fixe menu, but this is just because I prefer fewer courses and no dessert. In all the years I've been coming here, I've never been disappointed with a dish. The service has also been 100% consistent, and I believe we've always been served by the same man, who is attentive but demure with a dry humor. This is THE place for a romantic two-some, or a very enjoyable dinner with a best friend or a couple of good friends. It's not the place for big groups or boisterous diners. Trust me, I've lived here for years, and this is one of the only places I go back to, time and again. It's the kind of place where you just want to be a regular -- whether that's once a month, or once in while, or every time you're nearby. No doubt we will soon be eavesdropping alongside one another some enchanted evening...", "author": "Friday F."}

She lived close by 30 years ago and she and my grandfather used to go often. She said it has not changed a bit.  Cute, intimate and a very french restaurant.\nRegarding the length of the meal:  ITS A FRENCH BISTRO...IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE A QUICK MEAL.  Don't go there if you want quick.  Isn't that a given? Jeez!\nIt was pretty classic french bistro food. Good. Consistent. Nice wines by the glass.  We split the smoked salmon appetizer.  Very clean tasting. Cream of Mushroom soup came with the meal. Yum! I had lamb-I am a lover of lamb and thought they did a great job with it.  We shared the Passion Fruit Mousse for dessert--to die for.  I love anything with Passion Fruit and it was really spot on.  My grandmother actually lives in Hawaii now and she agreed that it was really good.  And she gets passion fruit anything anytime she wants.  \nVery good date place as well, I'm assuming because it was cute and intimate.", "author": "Alulubeth O."}

It took way too long between our soup (that the waiter didn't even describe and I'm not sure I can say for sure what it was), and and our entree.  The waiter kept telling her about our order, which gets written in a lined notebook, but she didn't prepare them for quite some time.   \nI ordered the shrimp with pernod flambe as the appetizer.  It was overly sauced and runny.  Very garlicky as well, which didn't really work. And given the open kitchen, I would have seen flambeeing, but trust me there was no flambe. \n\n My husband had a salad as well which was basic and inoffensive.  He had the duck for his entree which was overcooked and oversauced again.  I had the special which was scallops prepared in an absolutely unidentifiable and much too abundant sauce.  The scallops were inedible in places.  Could not even chew it.  The waiter never asked how things were, and given that there were 4 scallops served and 2 1/2 uneaten you'd think he would have asked how things were.  \n\nAnd finally, when refilling the water for the table next to us it was evident that there was mold or mildew on the bottom of the plastic water pitcher.  That grossed me out completely.  \n\nI wanted to like this place as we had been there 20 years ago or so, and I used to go by it every day commuting to and from work, but it was a big miss.  We will not go back.  I'd give it 1.5 stars if I could.", "author": "S S."}

I was surprised that the restaurant was almost full when we got there at 6:20pm, and hoped that meant that the Yelp reviews I had read were true.  I am very happy to report that they are.  Rue Lepic is a great little restaurant offering wonderfully prepared dishes (you can watch the chef actually prepare your meal) at very reasonable prices.  Service was attentive, and although the wine list was a little sparse, I am glad I resisted the temptation to bring my own bottle (corkage is $20) and order one from their wine list.  It was a nice little pinot with a unique label.  It sort of matched the personality of this place.  The decor is a little different, but the place is very clean with good food and service.  Some of the dishes were outstanding in fact.  Our soup was wonderful (butternut squash) and the dessert, an incredibly rich chocolate mousse with strawberry and kiwi sauces, was awesome.", "author": "David S."}

In hopes of finding another neighborhood gem we were very disappointed. The food was not good at all - it had very few distinguishing french qualities other than the names and basic ingredients. The dishes were remarkably pedestrian - more akin to that you might find served at a large banquet rather than a small high quality restaurant. The atmosphere was equally disapppointing - as the dinner went on the place got colder and colder to the point that we had to put on our jackets. It seemed that the fan whcih was making the place so cold was put on to remove the rather acidic smelling odors coming from the open kitchen. I'm no trained chef as is one of the other reviews - but I could not agree more - this restaurant is not worth stopping at - go one or two blocks in any other direction and you will find a plethora of better choices", "author": "Patricia S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-29", "description": "i made reservations for this restaurant for my birthday... we had about 13 people. so when i first called I wasn't sure about the head count so I gave them an estimate of 12-15 which I thought was a pretty good approximation but whoever it was that I talked to on the phone wanted a credit card to guarantee the reservation which I thought was a little weird, but she told me  to call back when I had a better head count. SO ... having such a big party your bound to have laggers so I called ahead of time to change the reservation from 7:30 to 8:00pm. When we walk in half the party was already there but as I sit down the table behind us made very rude comments about us coming a little late which made no sense to me. The food was excellent. As for the service... there was an older asian women who I assumed was the owner, she was a fluttering butterfly to every table... EXCEPT ours. This made me feel like we were unwelcome. The waitstaff was friendly. all in all it was an ok bday. not the best but I've definitely had a better experience!", "author": "G Y."}

Where else can you find a wonderful 5-course French meal for less than $50 in San Francisco? The service was fantastic. The food was excellent!!! Our first course was a seafood pasta which was prepared simply but was soooo good. Next comes the cream of cauliflower soup that was so clean tasting.. I can probably do without the third course which was a choice of a green or a caesar salad  (was this included to cater to the \"white\" folks? I don't know!). I had their sweetbreads in a white sauce which was very, very good and my friends had steak au poivre. For dessert, I had a very rich Laganache chocolate. My friend had a peach sorbet served in a hollowed-out real peach fruit and the passion fruit mousse that my other friend had was also mouth-watering!! A very pleasant experience to say the least... We will be back!!!", "author": "Netoy D."}
