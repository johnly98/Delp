Read great reviews on yelp and got excited!\n\nSo I take my seat, not much d\u00e9cor... oh well, I'm here for the fish! I look at the menu, wow... it's pretty big, they have a wide selection! Awesome!!! They have sushi, nigiri, rolls, handrolls, several specialty dishes, menu looks great! And I am hungry... my stomach is ready!!! \n\nBut when the food came... I was pretty disappointed... I wanted to like this place... but... I just can't...\n\nButterfish Nachos\nThis was actually not a bad dish! The wonton chips were crispy and the salsa had a lot of flavor. My only and biggest gripe is that things didn't seem that fresh. I know it's hard to not prep things ahead of time... but the salsa seemed like it was sitting there since yesterday...\n\nJapanese Hamachi Sashimi\nWay over-seasoned, it felt like the sauce was overpowering the fish, the dish was basically salty sauce with some fish texture... Do not order...\n\nCrunchy Sake\nThis roll was literally just thin slices of salmon over rice with thinly and overly-fried potato in the middle, so there was some fish at top, then it was so so so.... dry in the center... \n\nSeasonal Nigiri Tasting\nThe fish wasn't well cut, there were several tears in our pieces... I'm not sure if that's due to the quality of the fish or the chef but either way... not great...\n\nThree Amigos\nThis type of roll was actually what I was expecting, nothing great, but would still love to eat! If you come here, get this!\n\nI know this review differs a lot from the other reviews for Hot Zuzhi... perhaps this place just isn't my cup o' tea or I really ordered the wrong stuff...not sure what happened... but didn't even seem like a bad night for them.\n\nI just can't recommend this place and wouldn't go back even if someone wanted to go... so that's why the 2 stars...\n\nHope I'm wrong on this though.", "author": "Mike L."}

We ordered the 3 amigos roll... which was less than $10 and sooo generously portioned. 5 pieces that were filled with huge chunks of raw fish. Yum! The udon and ramen were cheaper than any other place I've been to SF. It's definitely work the $10-11, but I would probably recommend a real ramen/udon place instead of a sushi restaurant. A whole (nice) meal in SF for under $30... can't go wrong :)\n\nParking was surprisingly easy. It's free street parking after 6 right out front.\n\n5 stars for the sushi roll and fast and very friendly service!", "author": "Michelle N."}

My absolutely favorite is the spider roll, it is so crunchy , so warm and soooooo delicious. I also like their grilled whole calamari, it is super good and I love it with aioli.

I can't believe some people just get to walk to this place from their apartment. \n\nThe dish that stood out was the Butterfish Nachos $10. I thought it was a fair price. While I Iove traditional style sushi, I like trying out something new. Fusion is okay as long as it's well executed. I'm a tiny bit wary of \"butterfish\" otherwise know as \" escolar\" or \"white tuna.\" But as long as you don't have digestive issues, you'll probably be fine if you consume it in moderation. It was crunchy, sweet, and spicy.  \n\nThe salmon tartar $2, nigiri tasting $18, hotate nigiri $5, and uni nigiri $7 were all delightful.\n\nThey have a special secret dish the \"salmon tartar\" that is served on top of a fried shiso leaf. Ask for it. I couldn't find it on the menu. But I saw someone else's yelp photo. Yay yelp!\n\nThis was the first sushi place in SF we tried since moving back to the west coast - I am really glad we chose Hot Zushi. The staff was very sweet.

I also like to get their $4 Butterfish Nachos during happy hour. Love how they prepare the nachos--fresh fish drizzled with some citrus and ponzu sauce. REALLY YUMMY and LIGHT.\n\nYesterday, I tried their grilled beef short ribs for the first time. Surprisingly, for $11, they gave us a big plate of meat. If it were in a Korean restaurant, this amount is usually cost ~$20-22. \n\nAs for their sushi rolls, I love their Dragon Rolls. Besides nice plating, the unagi and avocado are usually fresh and with the housemade unagi sauce, it has become a must order for my boyfriend and me. We have also tried Spider rolls and Beastie Bacon. Both are pretty good. I guess from my multiple times of visit, as long as you order rolls, you won't get disappointed.\n\nBesides rolls, I highly recommend their soba noodles.

To start the service is incredible!! 5 stars just for that.  I work down the street and coworkers and I are there like once or twice a week, it's starting to become a problem, I guess there are worse vices...  We will take hot zushi over the other sushi spots in lower Haight any day. \n\nOk let's get the to important part..the food!! Mmm. Apps are great, rolls are cool, but the star for me is the sashimi/nigiri. Always huge pieces and super fresh. The blue fin toro is heavenly. A normal order for us goes like this: (we like to eat, don't judge. Lol) gyoza, brussel sprouts, spicey green beans, hamachi sashimi Japanese style (my personal fav!) blue fin toro/hamachi toro/saba/unagi sashimi or nigiri, smashing pumpkins roll, Victoria secret roll, beasty bacon roll (don't hate till you try it), ozzy roll. And you know way too many Sapporo and sake for our own good. \n\nOk I think that's enough..ugh so good.", "author": "Justin W."}

My boyfriend and I ordered the tuna poke, butterfish nachos, sake nigiri, and tres amigos roll based on all the Yelp reviews.\n\nTuna poke: delicious and had more tuna than mango or avocado, which we were impressed/happy about! The fried wonton chips they used were perfectly crunchy and the best complement to the poke. Great dish.\n\nButterfish nachos: comes out with 5 fried wonton chips with a delicious mix of mango, tuna, jalepeno, and something else (can't remember off the top of my head) on top of each chip. Downside was we couldn't share them evenly but big upside was that it was SO good!\n\nSake nigiri: mouth is watering right now thinking about it - it's by far my favorite nigiri and choice at any sushi restaurant, and Hot Zushi's was no exception. They bring it out with sauce brushed on it and request that we eat it without soy sauce - big plus as it is not common to do, so I really appreciated that! It was the perfect mix of flavor and texture. Mmm.\n\nTres amigos: first thing we noticed was that the presentation was not great - it was basically falling apart on the dish it came out on. However, it was such a wonderful mix of flavors and ingredients that we got over that reallll quick. Eel, avocado, tuna, cucumber, and yellowtail combined to make a delicious roll!\n\nService was top notch - free hot green tea and a super sweet server who, and I quote my boyfriend, \"said thank you more than any server I've ever had\"!\n\nWill definitely come back (:", "author": "Mio W."}

I went here tonight with my friend based on the rave reviews we saw on Yelp, and I really thought the service was great, but the food we had wasn't anything special. I thought it was really nice that they started us off with some carpaccio though!\n\nTuna Poke: Probably the best thing we had out of all the things we ordered. Mango, avocado, and tuna came with fried gyoza wrappers, which I thought was a great Asian touch to the dish instead of just using tortilla chips.\nButterfish Nachos: This was the thing everyone was raving about, but the tuna poke was way better. This dish was basically tuna poke, but with different fish. It was topped with some kind of mango mix and was hard to eat. One bite and the \"nacho\" fell apart in our hands immediately (fish was a little hard to bite through).\nBig Poppa: We were intrigued by this because it sounded pretty good, but the spicy tuna taste was basically unnoticeable. Out of all the ingredients making up this roll, for some reason, the asparagus stood out the most, but not in a great away. Overall, not too much flavor in this one.\nCrunchy Wasabi: Not very memorable even though I just ate it a few hours ago. Again, I felt like it could have been more flavorful and was just missing something.\n\nIf you're a big sushi fan, I'm not sure if this would be the place for you! The service was great, it was super clean, and I liked the intimate feel of the space itself. We only had a few things from the menu so maybe there are some knockout dishes we missed, but, overall, I wasn't too wowed by this place.", "author": "Grace C."}

Looking at the check was a pleasant surprise. 4 special rolls, 2 nigiri, 1 baked crab hand roll, 2 miso soup, a large beer and ice creams - all came out to $77, but based on the amount of food and quality, I intuitively expected some $120.\n\n5 star for ambiance. It's a nicely decorated cozy quiet place, totally not crowded even on Friday night. No loud music. Without the TV could've been just perfect, but with it it's still very very good.\n\nService above expectations as well. The staff really cared. It's hard to explain, myriad of little things that builds an impression. Our hot green tea and water was refilled without asking, we got nice explanations of different meals and options, everything was served in timely and in a nice sequence. No one came up with annoying stupid questions like \"are you doing fine\" that would usually come in the middle of conversation, yet, at the same time, the staff was always available should we need something.\n\n5 star for food quality and portion size. Baked crab hand roll was a new thing I haven't tried before, it's delicious. The fish was fresh. Commonly known rolls were slightly different from what's served at other places, but I think they were better. Larger, fresher, tastier.\n\nWill definitely come back when I feel like having sushi in SF.\nCaveat: it's hard to find a parking spot around that place, but we managed to find street parking a couple of blocks away.

I'm glad we didn't. It just opened a week ago and the food is great!\n\nGenerous portions, fun specialty rolls, and the fish tastes great. I loved the Tuna Tataki. Server and Owners also very friendly. We will be back again.", "author": "Jay W."}

Waited 20 minutes to get our order in - 2 small dishes, 2 nigiri sushi. Took another 20 minutes to get the food. The food was overall mediocre. They need more than one waiter working the restaurant. I will not be back.", "author": "Johnny C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-03", "description": "The food was fantastic - delicious rolls, everything tasted really fresh, decent prices. But the wait time was just ridiculous. We were a party of 6 on a Sunday night and they were so busy that they could only bring out 1-2 items at a time at 10 minute intervals. It took about an hour for everyone to get their food!  Once it did arrive though, it was good enough that I would try it again, though maybe for takeout next time.", "author": "Mallika M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-22", "description": "We've been waiting to see what would become of this location given all the turnover. It's always a little perplexing what kind of restaurants people decide to open, ie a sushi place across the street from Nara, etc.  It's actually quite nice - the string beans appetizer was very tasty, the sushi was made with care and good ingredients, the rice was of a good consistency and temperature and everything was presented attractively. Also a nice and interesting selection of vegetarian rolls.  I like the food I had there better than, say, Sushi Raw down the street. The physical space is still a little sad-looking, same as it was before, though I can't really place why. The lighting is definitely a part of it, just like at Raijin.", "author": "queue q."}
