After years of passing by, the BF and i finally decided to give this korean, almost hole i the wall, joint a try. We went there, on a late friday night and had to wait a quick 15 mins for our table of two. The decor is simple here, no frills, surprisingly well ventilated,  good for parties of 4 and small (IMO), though they can accommodate more. \n\nShin Toe Bul Yi had an assortment of korean dishes included lots of soup options, the standard bbq meats, seafood pancake, and a variety of stews. From observation, almost every party ordered the fried chicken, so we decided to go with an order of that and the seafood \"casserole\" soup. Like any good korean restaurant, there was an assortment of ban chan that came alongside the meal. We were really happy with the options (broccoli, kimchee, bean sprouts, etc). \n\nThe star of the show was the fried chicken. Unlike some other korean \"bar food\" restaurants, their fried chicken was tender, with lots of batter, and not spicy. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and super moist on the inside. Surprisingly, not too oily either.  The portion was huge. That alongside the seafood soup was the perfect amount for two people. The soup had a nice variety of actual crap, mussels, squid, with noodles. It was the perfect balance to tone down the heaviness of fried chicken. \n\nOverall, a great meal with good portions, great services, and good prices. More and more, it's harder to find restaurants with a mom-pop feel in the city. Nice that this place is still standing and thriving.", "author": "Diane T."}

The quality of the food was subpar compared to their competitors. Our party of five ordered the kalbi, beef tofu soup, bulgogi, and the seafood tteokbokki. But first we were served a platter of appetizers (banchans) that was only enough to serve at most two people. Banchans are complimentary but I always appreciate it when servers give you a large enough portion so you don't have to keep calling them back to refill your empty dishes. We were a bit puzzled when our meat dishes came because they looked generic, pale, and unappetizing. We had mistaken the bulgogi (beef) for pork because of its light color and feeble texture. The garnish was lacking and quite sad on the eyes. The kalbi, although generous in portion, was tough and unflavorful. I highly DO NOT recommend ordering the protein here. If you happen to stumble across this restaurant and want to give it a shot, order the beef tofu soup. It was delightful and flavorful. It will for sure keep you warm on a chilly day in the city.", "author": "Amy T."}

(Unless you struggle to find parking - this is a residential neighborhood after all). The best way to describe Shin Toe Bul Yi is to think of a Korean grandmother that you visit once in a while. She'll cook really great food for you - it won't be Michelin-star worthy, nor will she feed you unlimited portions until you drop. But it will be super authentic, the portions will be sizable, and everything will be tasty.\n\nQuick things to note: on the lunch specials, they are TAKEOUT ONLY. Previous reviews have said that you can eat on the tables there - this is no longer the case. For lunch, if you can imagine those transparent clamshell containers that you get in a cafeteria? They use those here - one compartment has meat, the other rice, and the other two are banchan (sprouts, fish cake, house made cucumbers, and kimchi). It's definitely a large portion and will fill you up, for less than $10. You'll be served really quickly, and then can go outside and enjoy the weather and the nearby parks.\n\nFinal note - if you're transiting, the L Taraval (and 66 Quintara, but no one really rides that except locals) stops right in front of the restaurant.", "author": "Bobby W."}

Friends both ordered soondubu, which they also said was middle of the road. \n\nPrice: reasonable for SF. Cheaper than Han Il Kwan for sure. \n\nOverall: pretty standard SF Korean food experience. Not great, not terrible. I'll probably be back on a rainy day when I'm craving jjigae. \n\nFor next time: everyone was ordering their fried chicken and dang. It looked GOOD. I'll try it next time and might bump up my rating a star if it's as tasty as it looks. \n\nUPDATE: Went back and tried the fried chicken and squid ddukboki - was good enough to warrant raising my rating to four stars.

Food you wouldn't normally find in other Korean restaurants: Gopchang jungol, grilled mackerel, aguchim, kalgooksoo, fried chicken and so on. The menu has a serious Ahjussi vibe so is the place itself (and even the name), and that's what makes Shin Toe Bul Yi different from other restaurants. They don't try hard, but always consistent with their food and style. \n\nThe food is good. I've been going there for years and it's been always good. I wouldn't say the food is amazing, but rather on a humble side - the kind of food Korean mom would make. It's comforting. I love how they serve packed gim as banchan and barley tea.

The layout is unusual with the kitchen and cashier counter to the right as you enter and the dining area to the spacious area to the left.\nMy first dining experience here was in the late '80's or early '90's.  Most popular Korean restaurants are in the Richmond district of the city, but this one is a neighborhood staple.  My friend had a craving for their KFC (Korean fried chicken - not Colonel Sanders' version), so I placed a takeout order on a recent Saturday afternoon.  Parking can be difficult especially during dinner hours with a couple of popular Chinese dumpling places and Taraval Okazuya just up the block from here.  I illegally double parked around the corner, ran in, paid, and drove home.  The order (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LodVIa3Vgy_lTqxJPjVUsQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) was around $17.00 after tax for a pretty generous portion.  While driving home with the box half open (done by the restaurant so that the steam would not ruin the crispiness), the aroma made my stomach growl.  By the time I got home, I was fighting the Herman's Head debate... eat one?  or not?  eat one?  or not?   \nWell, the devil won so I grabbed a small thigh and bit into that still warm tender piece of goodness.  Please do not expect any heavy seasoning or sauce as this is a bare bones preparation of battered chicken.  The best part was that the meat was still moist after the fifteen minute drive home.\nThis was a nice reminder that I should probably stop by here one of these weeknight evenings to try some of their other offerings.

However, I suppose this is a very rare Korean restaurant where nothing is spicy.\n\nI wanted to really like this place because of it's proximity to where we live.  Instead of driving to Richmond to go to my favorite Korean restaurant, Jang Soo BBQ.  Unfortunately, I'm not even sure this passes as Korean food?  I ordered 3 dishes: seafood pancake, squid tteokbokki and beef bulgogi.  They gave us a tofu soup on the house, which was very nice, however, I can't even bring myself to like that.  For two people, we spent $60, which I felt like we were robbed especially since the quality of food was not even close to what I would expect from a decent Korean restaurant.  \n\nLet's start with the banchan.  There was kimchi, mung bean sprout, pickled radish, cucumber, fish cake and braised black soy beans.  The kimchi was not even remotely spicy.  It's red like it is suppose to, but I'm not sure where the heat has gone? The pickled radish was tough to chew, which leads me to think it was expired or perhaps left out for too long? I've never had pickled radish like this before.  The fish cake and cucumber were decent, so I gobbled these up since I was famished before I arrived.  \n\nThe seafood pancake came out and it was huge!  I took one bite and the texture was bizarre.  It was gummy and felt like I was eating a paste, so I thought it was undercooked.  In order to test my theory, I was taking bites out of the corners of the pancake, where it *should* be the most cooked, however, I think this is just the texture their pancake is suppose to be.  The only thing that was good was the vinegar dipping sauce that was paired. \n\nThe squid tteokbokki (rice cake) was a mess.  It wasn't even cooked with gochujang (chili paste), which is the fundamental ingredient in most Korean dishes.  Instead, it was drenched with chili oil and chili pepper flakes and it wasn't spicy.  I had to literally wipe off the chili oil with each rice cake. \n\nThe beef bulgogi and tofu soup was fine and decent in comparison to the other two dishes we ordered. \n\nPerhaps this place is a haven for those who cannot eat spicy?", "author": "Colleen L."}

The portions are large and the flavors are not trying to knock my tastebuds out of the park - I normally drink multiple glasses of water when dining out, but I didn't even need a sip until the end of my meal, so it seems like it's a lot less sodium-laden than restaurants these days!\n\nUnfortunately a couple of the items did need a little more flavor. This place seems to be known for their yangnyem tongdak, the \"deep fried chicken with house special sauce\", which excessively confuses me unless \"house special sauce\" meant \"no sauce\". The chicken tasted like robust fried chicken (only crunchy in a few spots, and tougher skin) with no seasoning, and although it was a bit tender and okay to eat, just seems confusing or lackluster with no taste. On the bright side, there was a buttload of chicken - pretty much a full silver platter full of it - and it was very filling, so yay leftovers!\n\nThe soft tofu stew had plentiful nice, soft, silky tofu, but was bland. However, it came on the house and was a nice gesture and well appreciated and enjoyed. I thought the banchan was tasty and seemed fresh and juicy - they had a total of seven which included bean sprouts, cucumber, fishcake, Japanese pickled daikon with some chili powder, some type of shriveled black beans, kimchi, and the white Korean pickled radish. The haemul pajeon came with a yummy red-hued dipping sauce, with a lot more scallions and chili powder in it than I'm used to being served - although it wasn't spicy. The seafood pancake itself was very thick and large while still maintaining a good cooked consistency, as sometimes it gets too doughy, and had decent seafood amount. It also had a lot more egginess to it than usual which I thought was a good thing, and it just tasted really good with the sauce. The dolsot bibimbap was colorful and had a lot of veggies; my only complaints would be for the carrots that were cut too long and thick, and for the bowl that was not hot enough to make the rice as crispy as it could have been. Finally, we had the japchae which uses skinnier noodles but had good flavor, was not too sticky and not too wet, and had delicious chewy warm texture.\n\nThis place would get a solid three and a half stars from me, mostly rounded down due to the blandness of some items. This would be a good place for lunch as their lunch menu is very well priced and is observed even on Saturdays, however it is only for takeout. I really enjoyed dining here and would revisit for the quantity and wholesomeness of the food!", "author": "Amy Y."}

I believe everything on it is just under $10, whereas prices for food for dinner start getting into the double digits, typical of what you would see at other places. The food I've tried here is decent, but not something you'd rave about. Just recently I had the kalbi lunch special, where the meat didn't taste like it was marinated well. But it wasn't as chewy or difficult to eat as I've had at other local places, so at least that was good.

Don't expect a lot of variety here.\n\nIt's hard to gauge how busy this place actually is during lunch because it's takeout only so the only people around are just people waiting for their food to be ready.

There was only one girl serving 20+ people. She was doing one hundred things at once.  We got served but that's it. Nothing got refilled. We couldn't ask her what was that mystery awful thing in our monk fish. We got a cup with lipstick on it and had a hard time to get her to gives a new cup cause she was serving 20 other people.  She was very quick to bring the bill though. \nIf you see people waiting outside, it's not because this place has great food. People are waiting outside because there is only one server serving other 20+people and doing one hundred things at once. \nWe are not coming back here!", "author": "W C."}

Just dont come here when it's rush hour; saw the line when we left and there was a crowd in the cold... lol Thankfully, I came in with a friend and there was a space conveniently for 2! If the price is high at this place, expect a large portion (except for soups and bibimbap 'cause portions for those are fixed). This place is super cramped because they maximized the space for more people to fit which is fine by me. Rush hour must be a pain in the butt. The waitress is really sweet and I was teaching my friend some Korean phrases which included 'hello' and she came over because she thought we were calling her over OTL. so embarrassing.\nThe bathroom is pretty grimey but it doesnt phase me; as long as it works. Just wish they had a hook so I can hang my bag or jacket.\n\nOn a different note, isnt this place called Shin Toe Bul Gi or naw? It's been 2 months since I've been so idk.", "author": "Victoria H."}

There is nearly always a line, which i believe speaks more to the quality of the food than the speed of service which, admittedly, could be slow at times.  In any case, the food is well worth the wait.  My wife and I have introduced family and friends to the place, and they have quickly become regulars.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the Korean-style fried chicken is a must order.  The crust is perfectly crisp with just the right amount of salt and spice, and the meat tender and juicy without being greasy.  The mackerel is outstanding - grilled to a slight crisp on the outside, but tender, moist and flavorful inside.  Best of all, it comes with a free side of mild-to-spicy tofu soup, which our kids love.  I am less enthused by the japchae, Korean-style glass noodles, which are a bit too oily for my liking.  An added plus is they will give you a pitcher of water so you can refill your own cup whenever you'd like.\n\nSo, go expecting a line and go expecting great food.

Kim chee was a little more acidic/sour than I'm normally used to, but the beef and the rice was PERFECT. Very tasty and when mixed together with the red spicy sauce it was OH SO YUMMY! They lined the stone bowl with a little bit too much oil, which mostly got soaked into the rice, but that's probably why it made the dish so tasty..haha. \n2) Seafood casserole: DELICIOUS! Great blend of all the seafood ingredients! They really packed in tons of seafood and didn't skimp on the works! The broth was calibrated very well! \n3) Beef and Calamari sauteed: A little on the oily side, but very tasty. The beef was very tender and the calamari was very rubbery (like it's suppose to be). Just wish portions of this dish were a little bigger. \n4) Side dishes: nothing too notable. The kim chee was pretty good but everything else was ok. \n\nService: \nAside from taking our orders and bringing us our food, I really can't say she came around much to check on us to see if we needed any more tea or side dishes...so I'd say the service is a little below standards. \n\nAmbiance: \nDoesn't seat many, it's a very cozy and humble semi-hole in the wall.

The outside sign is a bit tattered, the ambiance is just okay, and a few of the dishes won't appear to be mind blowing.  And yet, despite whatever shortcomings they may seem to have, the place is still so good!\n\nI'm not sure what exactly it is that makes them so lovable, but their fried chicken dish might have something to do with it.  Whenever I'm there, I see it show up on people's tables more often than not.   It's not something unique to their menu, but they do theirs a little differently.  Instead of just the usual wings and drumsticks, they also include chopped up pieces from the breast and thigh.  Though it makes for some awkward looking pieces, the taste is spot on!  The batter can be a little thick, but it's got some flavor, the portion is generous, and the meat is moist (for the most part).\n\nBeyond the fried chicken, the rest of their food is not too shabby, though nothing stands out as a star.  If anything, the haemul pajun (seafood pancake) would be the closest - loaded with a good amount of seafood, it wasn't too doughy and had a nice bit of crispiness.  Their broiled fish dishes are good, and the bulgogi is my favorite of their meats, but it's served as slices rather than chunks (it still tastes good though).  Sadly, I was disappointed with their kimchi jiggae (kimchi and pork stew) as it was too thin for my liking.\n\nIn addition to the usual array of banchan, I love that they hook you up with a free dish as well.  Depending on what you've already ordered, they'll usually give you a small pot of basic soon doobu, or a few pieces of mackarel(?).  Free food definitely goes a long way!

The exhaust fan is covered in oil and gunk, and the windows and blinds are super dirty. Obviously they do not do any upkeep. \n\nSo ok, since this place has a 4 star review with over 400 people, I'll give this place the benefit of a doubt. It has to good right? WRONG! This was the very first time Yelp reviews disappointed me. I'm sorry for all the ones who love this place, but this place serves disgusting food and possibly day(s) old food.\n\nThe day that I came in, it was fairly busy so my party and I had to wait about 20 or so minutes for a seat. I didn't mind the wait since I was anticipating that the food would be really good. We got seated at the corner table by the window and were surrounded by dead plants and an aloe vera that poked me in the head when i leaned back. There's also an almost dried up cactus in the corner. \n\nServices was alright, however they did forget our water, but the hugest disappointment was the food. Everything tasted old, and bland. All the banchan was tasteless and tasted old. Kimchi was dry and not spicy at all. And why is the oil for the anchovies banchan so jelly-like? It sits in a bright red liquid and I thought it maybe be spicy, but there was no spice. \n\nFor our main course, we had the Kalbi, BBQ Chicken and Cod Roe tofu soup. EVERYTHING was all tasteless and under seasoned. The tofus soup was the worst. The roe was super dry and very hard and rubbery. The soup was super watered down and had no flavor. It is suppose to be spicy but there was no heat whatsoever. They used firm tofu versus soft which is what usually helps thicken the consistency of the soup. They also tossed in a whole sprig of cilantro or some herb but I couldn't tell because whatever green they tossed in had absolutely no flavor. There was no raw egg which usually tops this off. And it did not come boiling hot which is how tofu soups usually comes out. It was so unappetizing that I could not finish the food.\n\nEveryone in my group was disappointed and it cost as much as really good Korean food at other places. \n\nThis may be the harshest review I've had written, and whomever reads this may or may not think I'm crazy because there are at least 400 people who believe this place is good eats.

Two of my friends and I went on a mini exploration/sight-seeing in San Francisco. A few hours later, all three of us were craving for glutinous rice cakes also known as dukbokki. I have never eaten at Shin Toe Bul Yi but both of my friends raved about their food. I'm always down to try new food so I agreed to call in and place an order of dubokki to-go. When we drove there to pick up the food, we thought better. Why are we ordering only one thing to-go when none of us had dinner? We changed our mind and decided to dine-in.\n\nWe ordered a hot tofu soup and a stone-pot bimbimbap with kimchi and beef. Everything was delicious! The banchan was good too. I don't know if there's refills on the banchan but my favorite was the fish cakes. Soft, sweet, and chewy. Yum. On a side note, because we initially ordered the dukbokki to-go, they served us the dukbokki in the to-go plastic box.  I was kind of turned off by that. I thought the taste would make up for it but it didn't. It was slightly under-cooked and it wasn't as spicy as I would've liked it. Overall, this place is above average and I would come again.

We signed our names and were seated after a short wait. During our wait, I quickly scanned the tables to see what people had ordered. Almost every table had a huge order of fried chicken, so I decided that it was a safe bet to order that too.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, we decided on the fried chicken, tofu soup with beef and bulgogi. We were served some side dishes, and fried mackerel that was on the house. The food was definitely not bad, but nothing special either. The bill came down to $55 with tips for two.

They include:\n1.  oz \n2.  sarang bang\n3.  john snack and deli (which is a hybrid of korean and mexican)\n\nGleaning on my experience,it is easy to see how I am a connoisseur of the masters of marinated meats.  Doing KDer an xmas service and knocking down a restaurant off her endless bookmarks, we arrived at Shin To Bul Yi's door.  It was a monday night yet it was packed.  It is a very small restaurant and seems like it was converted from a residential house.  I advise going in groups to eat Korean food as it allows you to order more and sample each others plates.  We put our name on the list and huddled inside for warmth, staring at patron eating their food with doe eyes until we were shoo'd outside to wait in the cold.  Once seated, we ordered:\n\n1.  bulgogi: By far the best dish.  It was perfectly marinated, tender and juicy.  The portions were generous where all 5 of us had our way with the dish.  If i had it my way, i would have taken this dish all for myself.\n\n2.  kalbi: The kalbi was very flavorful.  There was a mention of how authentic this place was in terms of not being too Americanized.  The kalbi i love from john's snack and deli which comes in form of a kalbi burrito is very sweet.  Shin Toe Bul Yi's kalbi was subdued in sweetness and was also very good.  I preferred the bulgogi but there are no complaints about their kalbi.\n\n3.  tofu soup: The tofu soup was given to us on the house.  It was good for a cold night and not spicy at all.  There were generous portions of tofu and a good complement to pour over the rice.\n\n4.  fried chicken: The fried chicken was a house specialty and many yelpers have raved about it.  It is certainly good, but in controlled portions.  It is very fatty and rich and taste similar to KFC.  I could eat one or two pieces but after that, it was a little too much.\n\n5.  seafood pancake: I didn't touch this as I don't really eat seafood outside of fish.  This dish came at the tail end of our dinner so everyone else was much too stuffed to really put a dent in it.  \n\n6.  bimbimbap: My gf got the bimbimbap bowl for herself.  It is a rice bowl with kimchee, bulgogi, various vegetables and egg.  I am not a big fan of kimchee thus, wasn't as fond of this dish as she was.  However, she enjoyed it immensely.  \n\nBecause of my lack of experience in Korean cuisine, I relied more on my tastebuds.  The food was certainly very good but not the \"zomg\" level that all tastebuds recognize.  The service is okay here; there was one waitress for the whole place so it is only natural that things might take longer.  The restaurant itself was definition of mom and pops.  It certainly wasn't aesthetically pleasing, but exuded an aura of comfort, much like a Korean mother's kitchen.  The price is very reasonable if you go in a group...ours was tabulated to $20 per person.", "author": "Brian V."}

I'll admit right away that I'm not Korean fried chicken expert.  In fact, I'm not sure I've even had Korean fried chicken before coming here.  So it may be good for what is is, but I think I prefer my fried chicken just plain American style better.  The sauce that comes with the fried chicken isn't as spicy as it looks so don't be afraid.  For lunch we also ordered the scallion pancake - very good - and the beef glass noodles - okay, a little bland.  I also really liked the kimchee dishes that came with lunch.

I mean, how can you go wrong with fried chicken? Especially, with me. When it arrived to the table, I quickly grabbed the flapper portion of the wing. Upon first bite, I was disappointed. Disappointed with the flavor, the 'crunch' or lack there of.. It was bland to me. The special sauce wasn't very enticing... It seemed like some kind of Sriracha/Cocktail sauce concoction that couldn't even rescue my craving for fried chicken. I have had other KFC's (Korean Fried Chicken) before and this made it to the bottom of my list. \n\nThe Kimchi rice arrived to the table and my eyes glazed over as I saw the mounds of vegetables on top that was covering the egg. The Kimchi in it was not cut up too small and neither was the beef. After a quick mix of the pot, I took a bite and the taste was just right.  This was actually good. \n\nThe Bulgogi was deceiving. It didn't look appetizing compared to what I have had in the past but it was good. The meat was tender and it had the right amount of fatty pieces. The marinade was flavorful and it had the right amount of sweet and savory on my palette. \n\nNow on to the tofu soup. It arrived at the table and I didn't want to touch it first because I didn't order it. So I had to confirm with the waitress that the soup was actually for our table. The taste was incredible. I can say that this was the best tofu soup I have ever had. The broth had the right amount of spice. It had a generous portion of tofu. I wish it had more veggies though.\n\nAlthough the tofu soup was amazing, I don't think the KFC nor the Kimchi rice would have me back here anytime soon for dinner.", "author": "BYRON D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-16", "description": "Based in Sunset, SF this Korean restaurant is unbelievably busy and well known in the area. To our surprise we managed to get a table quite easily. Mind you, it was only 5pm. By 6/7pm the queues were up to 20-25mins. It's a small shop with about 10 tables comfortably seating up to 40 customers inside. Unlike the usual Korean restaurant in town, this one is actually run by Koreans. More importantly this particular shop is filled with Korean people! Without going in you already know this place is authentic. The food isn't presented amazingly well and nor do they pride themselves with their smart design and creative combinations. This place is all about flavour. For those who can't stand food too spicy, their soups are not that spicy. In fact I'd consider them mild compared to their English counterpart that I'm used to. We had to try their fried chicken as every other Korean customer had ordered a plate. I would describe it as a tasteless version of KFC but would definitely suit the more pro-healthy patrons with its abnormally low level of oil and salt. It was a disappointment, but perhaps that is how it is served in Korea. I would have expected at least a minimal amount of marinade in the meat. Moving on: their pre-starters (little pickle dishes) were prepared well and tasted above average, generous in size too. Their pajon (or pacheon) is similar to many found in the states but European versions seem to be thinner and lighter but smaller in size. Beef, I forget the name, probably the beef ribs on flat iron was amazing. The marinate was well prepared and it was cooked perfectly: not overdone! The bill came to $97 for a table of 6 and we ate a lot! I would recommend (even though I only gave three stars) simply because I believe this is genuine Korean food and its a taste of Korea. Do try it out, but it may not be your cup of tea.", "author": "C G S."}

Honestly, nothing worked well with this dinner; strong nod from the Korean friend from Pusan who said that she would not come back for a repeat visit. Sadly, I must agree with her. \n\nPanchan was perfunctory; nothing exceptionally tasty, crunchy, pickled, or peppered.

My heart sank\n\nThe bibimbap: the black stoneware pot was not heated up hot enough to brown and 'crunchify' the rice beneath. In fact, the egg that sat in the middle didn't 'cook' properly when mixed together, because nothing inside was hot enough to cook it to keep from getting wet and gummy. Another dud!\n\nSizzling iron plate that held the bulgogi also did not get hot enough (either that, or the meat was too wet). That grilled flavor was just in absentio and we all looked at one another, silently, kind of like \"How can every dish be so 'meh' after the yelp reviews?\"\n\nThe lady server was so polite and kind. She was generous in gifting us with the fish (no matter how many times i eat mackerel, I deem it too fishy of a fish)...

They give you one bowl of white rice, but we always ask for another because my brother is a gluttonous pig. The tofu soup is pretty good, but the seafood wasn't THE BEST, but they give you a fair amount. The kimchi bibimbap is my favorite because it's a pretty large amount of food and the kimchi is very good. I like my food spicy so I usually put a generous amount of hot pepper paste into it. The chicken is good too, not overly cooked, and it has just the right amount of flavor. These three dishes are plenty enough for two people. We usually never finish it all and always bring home the left over chicken. Can't waste it, that's crazy talk! \n\nThe service is pretty fast when it's not crazy busy.

You can still eat inside the restaurant but the food is served in to go containers.  I think you can still order from the entire menu and it's much less crowded during lunch (there's usually a line in the evenings).  Plus they have cheap lunch specials (12 PM - 2:30 PM, M - F), mostly noodles, BBQ and rice bowls for $6.95 or $7.95.\n\nI had the seafood bowl ($7.95).  The to go container was packed with food including five types of pan chan (thin fish cakes, napa cabbage, blanched bean sprouts, crunchy cucumbers, anchovies), steamed white, saut\u00e9ed seafood, scrambled egg and veggies and a cup of spicy red sauce.  They thoughtfully put the spicy and non-spicy pan chan in separate compartments.  I wasn't sure if they would include pan chan or not but am happy that they did (and in abundance).  Good pan chan, not amazing but definitely solid.\n\nI stirred the sauce w/ the sauteed items and rice first.  The sauce was a bit too sweet and not spicy enough but the sauteed squid (not overcooked), clams, eggs, zucchini, carrots, onion and mushrooms were very good.  Because you just get steamed white rice, the overall dish is inferior to bi bim bap in a sizzling stoneware pot.  \n\nThe restaurant staff is really nice (consistently so).  It's comfy inside even though the outside doesn't look too clean (not that I care).", "author": "Lolia S."}

It's been almost a year since I've been back.  It was definitely not a good experience and I felt really disappointed. I felt bad for my brother and sister-in-law. We got seated right away and the waitress literally didn't come to us until 40 minutes later. We would try to get the waitress attention but she would look pass us and take orders from people who came in after us. Pretty sad. Not only did it take us 40 minutes to order. It took us probably another 40 minutes to get our food. We  only ordered two things which was a bibimbap. My brother would joke around saying the waitress probably hates us. I think he was right. Haha. When we got our food we didn't even feel hungry anymore so we only ate for about 15 minutes and wanted to leave because the waitress was being rude. We would ask for water but didn't even give it to us until we asked again. She took away the chair next to me when there were other seats she could have taken. I really don't know what to say about the service other than it was super shitty. The food is good but now that I think about it there are better Korean restaurants than this and way more cheaper.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-11", "description": "We went a bit crazy when ordering..broiled fish (king fish I believe, came with two fairly sized fish!)...kalbi short ribs....jap chae(sp?)noodles...huge seafood pancake....two bowls of rice..the side dishes...and a complimentary spicy tofu soup? Wow..our table ran out of space and the TWO of us were stuffed (with plenty of left overs)!! ...stuffed to the max.. anyways..decent service! Came here at 550pm and were the first diners there for dinner, left around 645 and it became a full house.\n\nKeep in mind, I prefer my food with less sauce, less salt, and essentially more toward the \"bland\" side. With that being said, I really enjoyed the food here! So for those that expect and enjoy saucy, saltier, and flavored-blasted typical korean food, these dishes may be up to par with you.\n\nBroiled Fish- comes with two fishes, about 10 inches in size I guess? It was too salty ( for my tasting but I think it's suppose to be like that cause the bf loooved it). However, the fishes were nicely fried on the outside, and soft in the inside. We were only able to finish one of the two, and packed the other one to-go (which stunk up our fridge with its fishy smell lol), and actually made \"salted fish\" fried rice the following day...which tasted awesome.\n\nKalbi short ribs - these weren't as flavored and sauced up like many other restaurants, but I loved it like that! The flavor was still there, just not as heavily like how others serve it. My favorite part of ordering kalbi are the ribs..and sadly it only came with two. When the dish initially came out, it was sizzling hot and medium rare (sooo tender!!), but fifteen minutes later, the remaining pieces became well-done..so it got very tough. Although I understand that this typically range from $18-$22, I don't quite think its worth the $20ish .. *something* was missing.. can't quite distinguish what it was though. \n\nJap chae noodles: these noodles are addicting to begin with, the flavor was light enough for me, but the beef was way overcooked. The onions in this dish were basically raw...generally I prefer raw onions, but the pieces were served too large so I couldn't handle it. Packed majority of this dish home & ended up re-frying it so the onions can be cooked more. \n\nSeafood pancake - not as crispy as how other restaurants make it. But I did enjoy the fluffiness (sorta dough-like texture) of the pancake. Pretty big ...filled with, what it seemed like imitation crab meat, squid, mussels, green onion... also had a noticeable additional layered of eggs on top of the pancake.. Again..we packed half of the pancake home, and pan-fried it again since bf preferred it crispier.\n\nSide dishes included bean sprouts, kim chee, kim-chee radish, fried fish cake, and cucumbers...all pretty subtle flavors and not overly sauced...perfect for my tasting. There were only two other two-tops when we were there (not busy yet), so our side-dishes were automatically refilled whenever she saw it empty. \n\nHad we known that there was complimentary spicy tofu soup, we wouldn't have ordered so many dishes! Soup was okay..not a big fan on soups though.\n\nOur meal ended up close to $90...included with a small hot sake. Despite how much we ordered, and the 4 boxes we used to pack our food to-go...she still wanted to charge additional 0.10 per paper bag? I would figure that she would have just given it to us. Regardless, we purchased two bags cause we didn't want to carry the boxes out without them. \n\nDecent food, service was prompt in the beginning, but not really sure if we would come back again.", "author": "Shirley A."}

And, if I could, I would probably eat it at Shin Toe Bul Yi. STBY is Korean food heaven on Earth. I was a little miffed that they didn't serve their full menu for lunch, but I'm really glad I gave them a try for dinner.\n\nThis place is no-frills, down to earth, baller Korean food. Every dish is significantly less expensive than other places, but twice the size. They bring you the most ban chan I've seen thus far in my SF and Los Angeles Korean food adventures: 7 different sides, not including a huge thing of fresh, boiling hot tofu soup with cucumber and mushrooms. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and I got the dolsot bibimbap. It was enough food to easily feed 4 people (we ate through the pain, like champs), made for excellent midnight snacks and lunch the next day, and came to $30 including tax and a hearty tip for our lovely waitress.\n\nLet me say, the hype about the fried chicken is totally deserved. I don't know what they're doing to the chicken to make it so moist and frankly, I really don't care. I thought the fried layer was unlike anything I've ever had. It was thin and crisp, but not greasy. We took down a ton of that chicken without feeling weighed down, and it was even good cold when we ate our leftovers at home (probably because it's not overly greasy and doesn't get soggy). Way better than the extremely dry chicken they served us at Toyose.\n\nSo much love for Shin Toe Bul Yi, I will definitely be back soon!", "author": "Rachel A."}

The best thing about the chicken is the dipping sauce; otherwise it's just mediocre. It's nicely fried and not greasy, but nor is it super moist or flavorful without the sauce.\n\nThe bimbimbap was just ok...nothing memorable about it.

The beef on it was horrible, it didn't have a ton of flavors and god forbid you take it home to eat the next day cause it will turn into a greasy soggy mushy mess.

The atmosphere is comfortable and it's almost always busy when you go for dinner or on the weekends, but if you know the right times to go waiting is very minimal. I usually go right when they open for dinner. They use to serve lunch but now it's a \"to go - take out \"kind of thing. Funny though - you can eat there with you're take out if you want.\n\nMy usual order is the korean fried chicken (you get a heaping plate of this) and beef tofu stew. You get the usual korean fare of kimchi, picked vegetables, and such. They almost always give you a free side dish, usually I get the mackerel which has become one of my favorites. Sometimes we get the pancake for appetizer but the above is really enough to eat with room for taking home left overs.\n\nI've tried different things like the bibimbap, noodle dishes, and the bul go gi.

There is a really comfortable, homey feel to the place.\n\nYou sit down and they give you my favorite side dish, the green onion pancake. They always have different side dishes whenever we come. Their kalbi is good. Their bulgogi (spicy pork) has too much of this thick sauce on it on my opinion. Their fried chicken is goood. They even give you complimentary grilled mackerel which is also goood.\n\nSo it's story time. The first time I came, 8 out of the 10 tables in the place had fried chicken on the table. The only two tables without fried chicken was the only non Asian table and my table. So I decided the next time I would get the fried chicken. So the next time I come in, we ordered the fried chicken AND THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY LEFT. How depressed was I. When I saw the couple that came in before us get a plate of fried chicken, my sadness showed on my face. The waitress asked me what was wrong and I told her that I really wanted fried chicken. She said she was sorry, but they had just a few pieces left so they give it to that couple on the house. :( So sad was I. Then the waitress comes back with a plate of four pieces of chicken and told us that it was HER chicken that she was going to have for dinner! Needless to say, that chicken...was....so....good. \n\nIn conclusion, they really take care of you here; their food is good; its a small place and they sometimes will stop taking people if its nearing closing time.

IMHO, this was the best item that we ordered.\n\nSpicy beef- i wasn't too fond of the neon red coloring, which made it look inedible.  It was a bit too sweet and not spicy enough.  \n\nGrilled mackerel- the 2 large pieces were delicious but a bit on the salty side.  We got 2 small pieces of lemon.\n\nSpicy tofu soup- complimentary item. High MSG content and low on spicyness and flavoring. \n\nThe joint is small and gets packed quite fast during peak hours.

Funny story about the pancake--they brought us one, we ate it, then they brought another one.  We thought it was a mistake, but they explained that the first one was actually a complimentary appetizer.  Sweet!  Though in retrospect, maybe they should've alerted us to that when we ordered.  Oh right, this is the SF dive scene, no pity for noobs.  Also, there's the usual array of free Kimchi and friends (AKA Banchan--thank you Wikipedia!), including some fried anchovies that were surprisingly delicious.  As for the chicken, well, I guess this is my new go-to spot for KFC.  And finally, they have this weird brown tea that tastes like Wheaties.  Good once you get the hang of it.  All in all, this was some damn good eatin'.\n\nThe atmosphere here is also rather unique and very cozy for an asian dive.  For one, they have carpet, and also lots of windows with these great horizontal blinds.

The chicken had good seasoning and texture, although some pieces were a little dry. Better than KFC tho.\n\nThis place actually is quite the oxymoron.

The bulgogi I ordered was ok, but just didn't have much flavor. In fact all the banchan seemed to be 'watered down' versions. The kimchee wasn't very spicy and the mung sprouts and cucumbers just didn't have enough flavor. IMO the food has made to fit the clientele for this area.

Took pieces of the leftover Korean pancake home and heard Jr. Yelper gag in the kitchen after taking a bite of one of the pieces. The pancake was mushy and not crispy enough.  Fortunately, Jr. Yelper had not taken too large a bite.  The roach was inside the piece of pancake.  Hubby confirmed it was in there and went \"gross\".  \n\nUp until then, we and our friends thought the food was not bad at all compared to other Korean restaurants we've been to.  The tofu soup was good and the small plates accompanying the meal was OK.  I liked their fried chicken which was a popular dish ordered by other diners.  The pan fried fish was too dry. The rib eye beef was good, not great. And the stir-fried calamari was rather spicy.  We told our friends about the roach and they don't plan on making a return visit.

I'm always conflicted when we're about to leave for another restaurant because I catch the smell of their juicy Kalbi ribs.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe place gets super packed, but oddly enough, we got a table for 6 right away last time we came. Make sure you wear old clothes because you'll smell like Korean food when you leave.\n\nService is lacking, however. They turned me away once since I came at 9 and they closed at 9:30. They also forget to give you some of the free items such as the soup or the fried fish.\n\nThe food:\n\nWhat's great at Korean restaurants is the plethora of appetizers. You have the kimchi, pickled turnips, cucumbers, anchovies, fish cake, bean sprouts as well as kimchi tofu soup or a fried fish. I think the rule of thumb at this (and most) Korean restaurants is if you order soup, you get a fried fish; if you don't order soup, you get the house tofu soup.     Shin Toe Bul Yi does give seconds on the mini trays of appetizers - major plus in my book since I can't get enough of that fish cake.\n\nCalamari Bok (saut\u00e9ed rice cake, calamari and vegetables in spicy sauce) - This is my faaaavorite dish at this restaurant. It's made with 4-5\" pieces of the chewy rice cake saut\u00e9ed in a sweet and spicy sauce. I'm not big on calamari though, so I ate around it.\n\nPork Bul-Go-Gi (broiled lean pork marinated in spicy sauce) - This is K's favorite dish. The thin slices of pork are marinated in the same sweet and spicy sauce. The meat is very tender and has great flavor. The only thing that worries me about this dish is the bright red color; it doesn't seem natural.\n\nKal Bi (beef short rib marinated in house special sauce) - Koreans make some dang good short ribs. I just love their marinade. It's sweet, salty and spicy. This Kal Bi was much meatier than other Korean short ribs. Usually, a majority of the pieces are just fat and bones.\n\nChicken Small Pieces (deep fried) - Last but not least is the fried chicken - hands down, the most popular dish at the restaurant. It's not your typical fried chicken that you get at KFC or Popeyes. The chicken is very crispy. I'm pretty sure they use cornstarch rather than flour for their batter. The cornstarch brings the crunchiness to a whole other level. After the chicken has been deep fried, it's sprinkled with a spicy powder.

What I mean by that is years ago it was really good, then up until a few months ago the flavors were lacking.  Now it's really good again.  They stopped giving complimentary Korean pancakes though, which sucks because it's pretty pricey for what it is (dough and green onions).  They still give the spicy soft tofu soup on the house though.  You come out smelling like Korean BBQ but it's worth it.", "author": "Sandy J."}

You need to know  that.\nTofu Soup- rich and red spicy broth with  velvety  and generous pcs of  tofu. We slurped that down in an instant. Perfect  on a cool foggy SF  night. 5 of 5\nSeafood pancake- pretty good but the bottom was bit soggy , the top side was perfect, should have asked them to return to grill  for a few. I've had it before and it is another must.\nThe comped  mackerel was real average, would not recommend.\nWould have like to get a few other items but ended up taking home half the pancake and 3  pcs of chicken.\nWeeknight it was just busy enough to stay full with 2-5 people waiting at any given time. We had one server for the whole room ( approx  40 people at 12- 14 tables) , she was adequate but not really \"serving\" or doing much clearing. Very much a neighborhood place.

Cindy K and Grace's friend joined us and good thing they did because that means we could order MORE FOOD! Grace calls up Euge and says, \"Hey, we're at Shin Toe Bul Yi, what should we order?\" Here's what we ordered:\n\n- Bul go gi (marinated bbq pork)...average. My memory fails me to remember any more so it must have just been OK.\n\n- Spicy sea bass soup...AWESOME! fish was fresh, and the soup was packed with flavor. \n\n- Korean fried chicken...okay, so the KFC here has a different texture from some other places (San Tung, Toyose). It's got more of a crunch to it (potato flour?), which I like quite a bit if it is done well. Pretty good with the crunchiness, but I thought that it was overall a bit on the bland side. Whoever made that comment in that STBY vs. San Tung thread to take STBY chicken and pour San Tung sauce on it should get an award for their genius.\n \n- Jap chae (thick cellophane noodles w/ pork and veggies)...average. consider it FILLER! \n\n- Seafood pancake (on the house)....average, I was waiting for everyone to arrive and was starving so of course it tasted good.\n\n- the usual banchan of stuff...not bad of a selection; notable was the little mackerel (was it a mackerel or one of those extinct fishies?). oh man that fish was good!\n\nSo overall, it was a 3.5 food experience...I'm really bummed I can't come back in the near future to check out whether it is really a 3.5 place. So why the 4 star rating?  \n \nBecause they had the BEST DAMN 90's R&B MIXTAPE PLAYING when we came in.

I still liked my experience here though and enjoyed everything, it just wasn't as amazing as I had hoped! \n\nIt took me awhile to make coming here a priority, even though I literally live across the street on 30th. The reason was because it looked so icky, dirty and run down on the outside, and I never peeked in. But once inside, it's warm and inviting all dark wood and cozy and super clean.

The waitress told us though that since it was only two of us if one of us wanted the cook it yourself option the other had to go with that also. \n\nSo we opted for the prepared and brought out to you option for the short ribs, and the onion pancakes, and some other items. The onion pancakes are something I love at Chinese restaurants, and the difference here was that these are made also with egg batter on the outside! YUMMY. It is a large order so of course I had plenty to bring home since my fiance is not a fan of that dish. In terms of the ribs, it was good, but a little plain. I guess the magic is in the 6 little accompanying dishes that come out for you to enjoy your meat with. Sprouts, flavored cucumbers, kimchee, little dried fish in a spicy sauce, and some other stuff. Pair that with your meat and there you go! Flavor! \n\nNext time want to try the fried chicken, when I saw the platters of it walking past me, I kept on wanting to change my order, it looked really good! \n\nAnyway regarding service, it was quick and fast, in terms of bringing us what we asked for, but there was about a 20 minute wait for the food (maybe dinner rush?) and when the food did come out it was almost tossed at us (again, maybe rush).

Also, one of the nice things about this place is that they give you a free piece of fish when you come here. \n\nKorean food always seems to be a bit more expensive than the other genres of asian food, but Shin Toe Bul Yi won't make you wince when you see the bill.", "author": "Jessica S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-17", "description": "Since we ran out of Korean restaurants choices around SF city, my friend suggested we venture out to the inner Sunset to try our luck on this home style Korean restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is small, cozy and feels like eating in a Korean family's dining room. The people who own and work there are Koreans, so we were confident that the food would be authentic and delicious. \n\nI should clarify that the factor that motivated the 3 of us to drive all the way across town to Shin Toe Bul Yi is because of Korean fried chicken. We ordered the fried chicken, a spicy tofu soup with beef, stir fried squids with scallions in spicy sauce, grilled beef short ribs on sizzling pan. Our order also came with rice and small plates of condiments like pickled cucumbers and cabbage, kim chee, bean sprouts, bean curds, and a few more. The small tables soon ran out of space with all the plates. \n\nWhen the fried chicken arrived, we were anxious to sink our teeth in the chicken pieces, but it was way too hot to handle needless to say take a bite. From the look of the chicken, it seem well prepared, fried to golden brown with a coding of batter. Once it had cool down enough for our mouth, we tasted. For me, it was nothing to hype about. The batter was too thick and you can still taste the flour. There were very little or no seasoning on the chicken so it was bland. The frying part was also disappointing that they probably put the chicken pieces in when the oil was still lukewarm, hence the chicken was greasy on the inside. Not like southern fried chicken or Japanese chicken karage at all. \n\nThe rest of the dishes like tofu soup was good, the grilled beef was fine, although I found the marinate a bit on the sweeter side. The stir fried squid with scallions and onions was common. After awhile, every item tasted like the typical red Korean spicy sauce, the soup, the stir fried, and the grilled items. Our taste buds were bland and couldn't taste the difference anymore. \n\nOverall, for a first time visit on a spear of the moment dinner is considered a success given that we got to eat a Korean dinner, laugh, and catch up with friends, which is the most important element of that evening and we did just that. However, when we brought up Shin Toe Bul Yi again, none of us were enthusiastic about going there the next time we get together. At least it won't be my first choice of Korean restaurant in town.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

I will never go back. \n\nI say you can always judge a Korean restaurant by its kim chee. Good kim chee usually equals overall good food.  As soon as I had a taste of the kim chee here, I knew this meal was going to be a huge disappointment. \n \nWe had the pork bulgolgi, the chewy spicy noodles, and the kim chee chigae.\n\nPork bulgolgi \nNot good. It was the usual thinly sliced pork however the sauce was bright red, only slightly spicy, very sweet, and thick with ketchup - Not what you would expect to find at a Korean restaurant. It reminded me of a bad Americanized Chinese restaurant's version of sweet and sour. \n\nChewy Spicy Noodles\nThis was OK. The texture of the noodles was as advertised. The sauce was average -  Sweet and spicy, but not very refined in flavor. \n\nKim Chee Chigae\nThis was average. It had a nice smoky bacon flavor, and a bit of tang from the kim chee. The broth was watery and not particularly hearty. I prefer \"My Tofu House\", but even their kim chee chigae isn't  extraordinary.\n\nThe only bright spot in the meal was the deep fried mackerel that came \"on the house\"  - Crispy and full of fish oil goodness. Yum!\n\nUnfortunately, on top of the food being sub par, the cleanliness was exemplified by the food spattered menus, and rice sticking to my shoe (the hair stuck in the pork bulgolgi didn't exactly get my mouth watering).\nHey, I'm all for mom & pop joints, but the comfort (and I don't mean hair) must be found in the food because there certainly is no love in sticky condiment bottles, and greasy tables.", "author": "Miyas J."}

While we wait for our food, they were nice to provide some tea. I guess it's a good time to catch up with my sister and talk about random stuff. \n\nSo after getting our food, we decided to rent a movie (two actually: Step Brothers and Wanted). Blah, blah, blah and we're home! I didn't try my sister's Bul Go Gi, but the pork was perfect red with just enough charred spots to avoid getting cancer. Not as spicy as I thought it would be, but the set did come with some sweet and spicy sauce. So I drowned the pork with the sauce and the kick of the spiciness punched right through! I wish I had more rice, but it's good that they gave good side dishes (Fish Cake, Kimichi, Pickled Cucumbers, Beansprouts and Anchovies), all which are my favorites! \n\nI really feel like eating once in a restaurant can't give you the full experience of everything they have to offer, but my first impression of Shin Toe Bul Yi is well-founded to say the least!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

San Tung's dried fried chicken wings are better, and the chicken steak (ji pai) at Cupertino Village A&Js Taiwanese style is SUPREME.\n\nOnly been here once almost 3 to 4 years ago. The most disturbing sight was the kim chi (the spicy marinated daikon and cabbage dishes) sitting on a counter and roughly a foot or two above were a swarm of flies buzzing in the air.

As is typical with korean restaurants, we got a ton of sides including an onion pancake kinda thing (which was decent), a tofu soup (pretty good), and your usual batch of sides.  The chicken was good, with a nice crunch when you bite into it, but I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it's missing a spice punch.  It's a shade on the bland side.

I'm not up on the real KFC apparently but figured I'd try out this place. It's down the street from my son's karate school and being a Wednesday and shit out of luck for going to San Tung, we ventured here.\n\nLocated on the south west corner of 30th and Taraval, like the many others have said the decor inside and out is minimal. Driving past the first time, I wasn't sure I wanted to stop, but I made a trip around the block and said to myself that if I found a close parking spot, we were eating there. Sure enough. There was my parking spot.\n\nGot the kids out of the car and smelled the delicious smells of bbq. Okay big seller. Initially we were going to take it to go, but figured the wee one was sleeping and I wanted to see what free goodies we were getting. Heh. I'm frugal like that, didn't you know ;D. And I like FREE.\n\nIt wasn't crowded yet at 6:45PM, we got a table no problem. First thing on the table, onion pancake and hot tea. YUM. Next were the 6 banchan. I only really liked the pickled daikon and the kimchee. Those little fishies and the cut up fishcake just too fishy for me. The cucumber too salty. We ordered the teriyaki chicken and, of course, the fried chicken.\n\nEVERY. SINGLE. TABLE. had the chicken... so we had to try it. It was piping hot when it came out. When it was finally cool enough to eat... it was alright. Rather disappointing actually. My mom's fried chicken is tastier. The flavor of the teri chicken was mild, like it needed to be marinated longer. They gave us the free tofu soup and it was too spicy for my liking, and the flavor was just a little funky for me.\n\nI can cross this one off my list. I can now say I've tried it and I won't be wondering anymore. For Korean I'd much rather go to Pine on Noreiga, the flavor of their BBQ is very tasty. And I eat much more of their Banchan. And well, I obviously know nothing about kfc, but if that's what it's all about then I'd rather just eat my mom's chicken or wait for a nonWednesday for San Tung!", "author": "Dina V."}

You can smell the strong Korean food smell even from the outside, and in the winter, it gets pretty drafty for the tables nearer the door.\n\nI noticed that a lot of people order the fired chicken, and it is pretty tasty, even if i don't usually like fried stuff. My favorite dish is the bul go gi(?) the beef on a sizzling plate, I order it every time I am here. I absolutely love this dish, whatever sauce they use on it, is great. This place has the greatest side dishes, much better than the other Korean restaurants I've been to in SF. I've tried a variety of their dishes, and since I'm not Korean, I can't say if the dishes are authentic or not, but the dozen or so dishes I've tried have always been good. \n\nEvery time I've been here, the place always gives a dish or two on the house. Many times there is this green onion pancake and sometimes we've gotten a soup or other foods.\n\nThe waitresses don't always see that your side dishes, the spicy tiny fish side dish is so good, or teapot needs to be refilled so you might have to remind them.", "author": "Jay L."}

I went with my brother and one of his friends (a professional cook), and we had a surprisingly great meal. We got 2 or 3 extra dishes without asking. One was a whole grilled mackerel. The cook guy says, \"Wow, mackerel is my favorite fish.\" The food just kept coming, and we just kept eating.

We wanted to go to a Korean place and this was a good meeting point for us already in downtown and my friend coming from San Bruno.  She had been here before and recommended it.  The place is quite small but it was full when we got there and we had a short wait for a table for four.  It's well lit and has a friendly atmosphere.  There were four of us and we ended up ordering the hae mul pa jun, ddeok beok gi, a fried fish (forgot what type) and a noodle soup.  The waitress was extremely nice, maybe because my friend visiting was from Korea and she ordered for us in Korean.  Though, I think they would be that nice even if that wasn't the case.  The waitress even brought us a complimentary plate of their fried chicken that so many rave about here.\n\nI thought the fried chicken was really good, the ddeok was really good too and had the squid with it.  The pa jun was okay.  I've had better.  The soup was good, but I prefer other types of Korean soup.  However, if you like that type of soup, it was pretty good.  The fish was good also, and I think you get more here than other places I've been.  The ban chan however, wasn't the best.

Immediately after ordering, the waitress brings about 6 dishes with little hors d'oeuvres/appetizers in addition to rice and a large bowl of spicy tofu soup (freebies!!).

I'd say that this is one dish that is consistently good here.  Last time we went, we also got the steamed sea bass, which I liked as well.

Large chunks of sea bass were at the bottom and it was admittedly very moist and delicious.  We also ordered the Kalbi, but it was a bit of a disappointment.

Basically the food is mediocre at best. So as I was saying, the food here isn't the best, or bad, but because I live so close to this place, I usually just settle for it because I don't want to drive too far to into the richmond district just for some food. The soups are usually bland and watery, their meat dishes like the kal bi is usually burnt to the grilling plate, and their fishes have this nasty after taste, which typically means its not FRESH! The only upside to this place is their green onion pancake, but that alone is not enough to save this place. And after the last TWO times I've been here, I've had the WORST service ever. If I could give it 0 stars, I WOULD.\n\nThe first experience was with the old lady (probably the owner), who was a total B**** about an order of soup that my party and I DID NOT ORDER. She not only forced the soup that we did not order upon us, but had the audacity to charge us for it. Apparently she has a hearing problem, so the next time you go there and she's your server, be sure to SPEAK UP. \n\nThe second experience was tonight, and it was with the short/stubby  waitress. I was waiting in line with my sister, and we preferred to sit in the inside since the seat they offered us was in the front near the doors, plus my sister has kids. So we offered to wait for the table away from the door since they were practically paying the bill and ready to leave. After they finish cleaning, the stupid girl comes with her broken english and tells us that shes giving that table away when we clearly told her that we'll wait for THAT table. We asked her why, and she was like well... they're customers. I looked at her as if she was stupid or something because... HELLO, we're customers too!  Not only did it not make sense since she was giving a table that could have seated 6 (which was the size of my party) to a party of 2 instead. So my sister asked the dumb waitress politely if we could get the bigger table since we had a larger party and if the other party could get the table next to ours instead (which seated 4, which would have been perfect for the couple). Instead of even acknowledging our existence she just rolls her eyes and walks off, oblivious to everything. So we finally had it with this place, and we left, FOR GOOD.\n\nGoodbye Shin Toe Bul Yi, we've had enough of your BS service and your mediocre food. I would much rather drive my ass to the richmond district and be treated with respect at a better establishment than here. For those of you who don't mind being treated like garbage, and eating garbage, then feel free to come here, otherwise I would suggest My Tofu House, Han Il Kwan, Muguboka, or any other place than here because they either serve better or the same quality food as Shin Toe Bul Yi... but the only difference is at least you would be treated with respect. It's a different story if they served GREAT FOOD, then I guess it would be okay to treat your customers like garbage, but if you don't serve great food and your service sucks, then you have no right to treat anyone that way. \n\nP.S.

All the food around us looked quite tasty.\nWe ordered the soft tofu seafood stew, the Beef Bul-go-gi, and the chicken teriyaki.  The soup was outstanding and the other dishes were above average, if not a bit overpriced.  Everybody else in the restaurant had order the friend chicken, and I wish we had done the same.  We had too much food for 2 people, and had to bring some home with us.\nIf we had to do it again, we would order the seafood stew and fried chicken, and come to think of it, we will do it again.", "author": "Leo S."}

Some nights it's easier to spot, because of the groups of people standing outside waiting for a table.  I don't know if it's because there is nowhere else to eat around Sunset, or if it's that good.  I think it's that good. \n\nThe first difference is the green onion pancakes.  Out of all the Korean restaurant on-the-house pancakes, these are the best.  I love that chewy doughy texture.   We usually get the bi bim bap or bul go gi, always satisfying and enough to take home as left overs.  Last time I tried their hand made noodle soup.  What a treat!  You can tell the noodles are hand made because they varied in size A LOT, but like any good hand made noodle, they are very fresh and very chewy.  By the way, the noodle soup is good for people who can't handle spiciness; it's sort of a clear broth with green onions and potatoes (but menu say it's anchovy based).", "author": "Candice B."}

Any time after that, the place tends to get crowded and you'll find yourself waiting around. Don't forget to sign in on the waiting list if the place is crowded. The list is hanging on the far end, near the cash register. I go here every now and then. Every time I go, the food is always excellent. \n\nNo matter what you decide to order, you get a free green onion pancake as your appetizer. It is really tasty with the red sauce. Also, you get free mini appetizers as well (some kim chee, tofu, pickled cucumber, takuan, etc). \n\nI went there with my family today and tried the soft tofu stew with seafood. It has soft tofu, clams, octopus, and a red soup stock that looks really spicy, but it isn't. You can taste a hint of spiciness, but overall, it is really tasty. If you don't like seafood, you can always get the plain soft tofu stew. It's good as well. Also, if you order soup, you get a free fillet of broiled mackerel. \n\nThe mackerel comes with a slice of lemon and is broiled to perfection. Crispy on the outside, warm and flaky on the inside. It practically melts in your mouth. \n\nWe also got a seafood rice bowl. It comes in a stone pot that's still sizzling when it gets to your table. There are bits of squid, clams, kamaboko (fish cake), a raw egg in the center, etc, all over rice. just stir it up (adding the sauce is optional) and eat it up! Also, we tried a new dish that has calamari, vegetables, and noodles in a spicy sauce. Again, it looks spicy like the red tofu soup, but when I tried the calamari, it had a slightly sweet, yet savory taste. Very delicious. \n\nOverall, you can tell that the food here is fresh and of good quality.\n\nThe fact that so many people show up at this restaurant everyday is a sure sign that they're doing something right over there! If you haven't gone already, I highly recommend going here at least once! five stars!", "author": "Kay T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-01", "description": "This place has its pros and cons, although I am no Korean food connoisseur, so this is just my personal taste.  and apart from my most recent visit about a week ago, I haven't gone in over 2 years before that, so it might not be exactly the same anymore.  \n\nIts appetizers are great.  along with the little plates that they give, they also serve grilled mackerel to every table, and they used to have free pancake but I didn't get it last time, so perhaps they've stopped. We ordered the spicy rice cake (dduk bokki?), fried chicken, soondoonboo, and japchae.  this place has one of the best spicy rice cake (dduk bokki?) I've had so far.  It's not too spicy (in fact it can be much spicier), but it has a good blend of sweetness to it that's to my liking.  \n\nI know everyone RAVES about the fried chicken, but really, it's very typical to me, nothing to write home about.  I think they might use a bit of corn starch or whatever because the fried texture is a little different.  but it's relatively bland with no special flavor.  I actually enjoy it quite a bit, but it's just not as special as other people said it is.\n\nThe japchae was normal, tasty as always, not too oily.  The soondoonboo was somewhat too salty for me and not spicy enough.  But i'm a huge fan of the soup so unless it's horrendous to eat, I'll love it no matter what.\n\nOther things I've tried in years past, bbq chicken, kalbi, bbq beef, bbq pork, bibimbop.  From what I remember, the taste was slightly off from other places I've tried before (I guess depending on your preference..this might be better or not).  The kalbi is cut differently from most places, it has one large bone with some meat around instead of cutting deep into the bone if that makes sense.  And nothing's too spicy.\n\nWhile the prices are pretty competitive with the other Korean places, the meat is somewhat on the pricier side ($14-19).   And the wait can be long, and it's small, so you'll definitely come out smelling like your food.  \n\nRegardless, I still think it's one of the better Korean restaurants in SF, and I always have Korean cravings every now and then, so I'll definitely go back again.", "author": "Christina D."}

Especially the fried chicken! Bibimbap could have cooked longer -- the rice didn't have quite enough time to crisp up. But the gigantic amounts of chicken are crisp-a-licious and the free onion pancake is delicious with the spicy dip. Solid types and amounts of panchan (especially for the vegetarian I came with). And you can't beat some spicy tofu soup to round out the meal, especially when it's free (and you have some extra red pepper handy). \n\nDo I sound unimpressed? I came away loving STBY. Love love loving it. I will drive to 30th and Taraval. I will wait for 20 minutes in the wind (Yeah, bring your poncho. It's COLD out there). I will cram myself and two other people into a table meant for only two. And next time, I'll ask for everything extra spicy. I'm giving this one four stars for general coziness. The food isn't fancy, the decor isn't fancy, the service isn't fancy, and the prices aren't fancy. It's all kind of homestyle. But unlike a lot of people writing reviews, I like it that way. Everyone looks like they're having a great time, and it seems like a point of pride for the waitstaff to send everyone off with mountains of take-away cartons from the enormous plates of fried chicken. \n\nShin Toe Bul Yi is warm and friendly, and a little grungy.

Based on the strong Yelp reviews, my group of 4 was looking forward to some delicious Korean food tonight. Wasn't going to happen! We ordered the highly touted fried chicken, seafood bi bim bap, eel bi bim bap, and gal bi. Along with the ban chan, we received the soft tofu soup on the house. The fried chicken was crispy but had a heavy batter and no seasoning at all. The flavor of chicken was lost somewhere in the cake-y batter. Had to create my own dipping sauce from soy sauce and the red paste used for bi bim bap to give it some life. The gal bi was the worst I've had. It came out on a room temperature hot plate (not hot and not sizzling any of the beef either!).  The beef was also at room temperature and without any grill marks. Hmmm...me thinks this was pre-cooked and thrown on a sizzling plate for looks. the bi bim baps lacked any flavor from the eel and from the seafood. Both toppings were clearly once frozen and defrosted. The free soft tofu soup lacked depth and character. It tasted like blocks of tofu soaked in boiled water that was laced with leftover sauce from kimchi jars. I'm not joking...it tasted like kimchee bath water! The ban chans were the highlights especially the little anchovies and fish cakes. The kimchi lacked both heat and tanginess. Service was efficient and lacking any warmth. Had to ask for water, tea, napkins, refill on empty ban chan dishes. Will pass on this joint next time I'm feeling in the mood for Korean food. This place and To Hyang are very over-rated.

They comped us the soft tofu soup and zucchini pancake and offered plenty of side dishes to keep my belly satisfied.  \n\nA few observations worth noting:\n* WATER & ROASTED BARLEY TEA - the server brought us our own large bottle of chilled water and pot of hot tea to keep us hydrated the entire meal without having to wait around for service.  YAY!\n* COMPLIMENTARY DISHES - it was so nice to order only an entree and have the restaurant decide that you should be able to enjoy an appetizer and soup any way.  The zucchini pancake could have included more veggies, but it was free and had enough flavor to not need the sauce.  The tofu stew was on the blander side, but it was still loaded with silken tofu and veggies enough to chow down on!\n* SIDE DISHES - good balance of seasonings and oil, tasted as if they had been made the same day rather than days before. Good variety ... no fewer than 7 dishes.\n* BIBIMBAP - could have sat over the heat longer to get the temperature of the bowl up.  The best part of this dish is usually getting a delicious crust of rice to sizzle around the edges, but this one just sort of died prematurely as soon as the egg got cracked in.  Bummer.\n* CROAKER - they gave me two entire fish with my order... heads and all.  TWO!", "author": "Jenny K."}

It's definitely a small little place but the Korean food and the sides are so good, When we got there two parties of 4 were adhead of us, we got seated probably in about 15 minutes, people have a tendency to eat and go, the food comes pretty quickly on the night I was there and yes the one of waitress there was pretty bitchy.  It's all good, the food was freakin amazing and on those 6 dishes it came to about 65 bucks, definitely coming back here for my Korean fix.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-08", "description": "Sketchiest looking Korean Restaurant ever. \nBest Korean Homemade food ever. \nBitchiest Waitress (The prettier one) Ever!\n\nYou'll definitely miss the spot if you drive pass it, when it's not dining time. But you'll never miss it if you go around dinner time. It's like Tartine Bakery, the line is the sign. There are several tables in the restaurant that accommodates groups of any size, 2 or 10. As many reviewers suggest, the circulation is poor so be prepared to smell like Korean BBQ.\n\nHomemde food is what you get here. There is a big difference between \"party food\" and \"home food\" in asian cousine. You only eat the \"party food\" when you have guests or go to fancy restaurants. And the food is so different from the food that you eat everyday at home. Let's put it this way, the food tastes like your mom, that's how we describe it.\n\nThe banchan (complimentary dishes) is pretty good. Fresh kimchi, pickled turnip, sauteed dried fish (great with beer or soju!), among many others. The complimentary Tofu stew is just amazing when it's freaking cold and humid out. If you order a stew, they would give you some bbq fish instead, very thoughful.\n\nMy favorite food here is the steamed sea bass. OMG...the chunks of fish are so huge and thick, steamed in the homemade spicy and sweet sauce, with tons of soy bean sprouts, and the soft tofu. I love the combination of various textures in a dish. The sea bass contains higher amount of fish oil (which is good for you) so the soy bean sprouts balance it out very nicely. The Tofu and the chunks of turnip are so tender and packed with the flavor from the sauce....mmm....so yummy!!\n\nThe rice cakes and squid stir fry is very tasty too. The rice cakes are well cooked so they are sticky, chewy, and soft in a balanced way. We ordered about 3 different dishes that are with spicy sauce, but none of them are alike, unlike some so-so restaurants that every spicy dish tastes the same. \n\nThe fried chicken seemed to cause a big storm on yelp reviews. They are good, with a kick of spicy marinate. But it's not THAT great. It's great if you go with a group of people and most of them are guys.\n\nLastly, the bitchy waitress. If it's your first time there and there is a line, GO PUT YOUR NAME ON THE LIST!! My roommate and I once went there in a very cold evening, all starved after a long day, and we waited inside while the line was short. The waitress obviously saw us many many many times as she walked around serving, and she smiled at us. But how on earth would we know that we need to walk all the way into the restaurant to put our name on the tiny book since there's no sign of any sort? We waited for like 40 minutes, nothing happened, of course, because we didn't know that we were supposed to put our name on the list. When we finally figured that out, we talked to the waitress, hoping that she would do something to accommodate us, since she knew we've been there forever. But she \"pretended\" that she was \"deaf\". She did!! It was as if she couldn't understand what we were saying. Totally ignored us!!!!! So we had to wait until everyone else is seated, and by the time we got a table, it was more than an hour later. She is the rudest waitress in the world. I bet if we were 2 cute guys, the situation would be totally different. Ahh....I'm still so pissed after so long.", "author": "Yuchi C."}

I love the food here so much I took my different groups of friends here for dinner & all continue to come here.  It's a hole-in-the-wall place but the food that comes out of the little tiny kitchen is tasty and satisfying.  I'm not Korean but I brought one of my BFF's who is Korean and she said it tasted like home cooking.  It's super affordable!  They throw in a free dish all the time...usually the tofu soup or the grilled mackerel.   I love the fried chicken.  It has a crunchy batter but moist in the inside.  You can't go wrong with either the beef bulgogi or spicy pork bulgogi.  The seafood pancake actually has a lot of seafood!  The place gets super busy after 7:30 pm.  (Learned that on my first visit.)  My girlfriend and I waited for an hour to sit down and I'm glad that we weren't turned off by the wait because I would of never known how good the food was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-02", "description": "After watching a movie at century 20 (daly city) and taking one look at the ridiculous, snaking line for the new buffet place right next to it, we decided it would be smarter to eat elsewhere.\n\nA friend had just eaten Shin Toe Bul Yi the night before and recommended our group (7 people) to eat there. Being the paranoid person that he is and attempting to get seated more quickly, he decided to put his name down on the waitlist as \"Jun Ho Lee,\" despite the fact that he is 100% Chinese (and apparently 100% idiotic) . Lesson learned: they do not prioritize Korean people before others, and will call your name/speak to you in Korean if you put down a Korean name.\n\nNotwithstanding the initial confusion with the name, we were seated after a fifteen minute wait. The restaurant is quite small and patrons are packed into this place with minimal elbow space. The friend who had eaten here the night before said every table ordered the fried chicken, so we ordered that. Please forgive me for the following butchered description of dishes since I was quite tired and did not really attempt to look at the names of the dishes. We also ordered a beef and potato stew in a clay pot (not sure what the name of the dish was), a pan-fried fish dish, a dish that looked like vegetarian fried rice noodles, and the teriyaki chicken. Honestly, no one said anything positive about the dishes, except for the beef and potato stew. The sauce for that was well-seasoned and had just the right amount of spice. it tasted like it had been stewing for hours. The fish was very mediocre and the noodles were too. However, I have to knock them for the somewhat expensive prices for these two ordinary dishes. The teriyaki chicken on the stone platter was extremely bland. I felt as though I could have made this dish with minimal effort. Though there was a sizable amount of chicken, it should not have cost $13.99. Things here are overpriced.\n\nThe fried chicken deserves its own paragraph for sure. It was extremely disappointing. Why is everyone ordering this dish? Have people never had fried chicken before? Better fried chicken can be found at the KFC a few blocks away. In fact, no less than 3 people at the table mentioned KFC with higher regards. It was terribly under-seasoned, perhaps even unseasoned. The batter was dry and floury. After my first bite, I began to think they forgot to bring the sauce. To my amazement, there is in fact no sauce that comes with this dish. This dish killed my spirit and left me craving KFC.\n\nOverall, this meal can only be described as disappointing. The only bright spot in this experience was the pleasantly-smiling Korean lady who wished us a happy new year as we left. God bless her. She was the only one smiling after our meal.", "author": "Gary L."}

The flavor of the broth was super delish...I was kind of scared it might be super MSG infused, but surprisingly, I didn't knock out or get a headache like I usually do with MSG.  So either there wasn't much MSG or I was invincible yesterday.  We also ordered  the fried chicken.  It was ok.  Asian version of KFC.  Lots of tables ordered it, so we wanted to try.

One thing to know... sometimes when they're extremely busy at dinner time they don't take orders to go.  Boooo.", "author": "Monica C."}

But it's probably also because after you've waited so long (sometimes outside in the cold) for a table, just about anything hot and salty tastes good.\n\nAnd if you are a fan of drinking water with your salty meal, bring your own. It seems like it's always hard to get a glass of cold water in this place. \n\nBut the people that work here are pretty nice. Just always in a rush.", "author": "m. e."}

The first time we went , we ordered a bit too much food and almost did not get the fried chicken (we ordered it too late, and they had too many orders in already)   But the second time, we were saavy and had a plan. As soon as we sat down, we ordered: FRIED CHICKEN! please.  Almost immediately after we ordered we got the onion pancake (on the house). Then came the fried chicken. Delish. As we were busily devouring the chicken, the waitress brought the rice and kalbi and we realized that we needed to pace ourselves. Sitck to the plan! But, just as we were getting full, the waitress came to our table with some tofu soup. Naively, I thought she brought it to the wrong table, but then she said \"on the house\". What, no way!  It was the perfect dish to offset the fried chicken and kalbi (which was excellent by the way). It was just mushrooms and tofu, but the broth was excellent. We rolled out of there with a small to go box and plans for a return visit. $29 for what could easily be a $50 meal at any other place: 5 stars.", "author": "Mashi M."}

The friendly lady who served my family brought six banchan--kimchee, tofu, fish (perhaps sardines), pickled cucumber or zucchini, pickled radish, bean sprout--and tofu soup, which is similar to a mild hot-and-sour soup. The #10 japchae, #66 haemul pageon (Korean style pancake and mixed seafood) and #67 yangnyeom tongdak (deep fried chicken served with house special sauce) arrived at our table in large portions, and the #4 dolsot bibimbap (mixed vegetables, beef & egg over rice served in sizzling stoneware) and #6 kimchee bibimbap (saut\u00e9ed kimchee, beef & egg over rice served in sizzling stoneware) in decent sizes bowls. The seafood pancake was thick and I was only aware of it containing squid. I added some chili sauce to the pancake to kick up the flavor. The yangnyeom tongdak was an actual whole chicken that wasn't split along the natural joints, but it was still delicious! Though the chicken was moist and supple and neither salty nor greasy, I did find meat near the bone to be very slightly pinkish, as if the heat barely penetrated the chicken.", "author": "Cliff W."}

The food is a little too salty for me, which took away from a pleasurable dining experience. Their banchan is also very limited compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. I ordered their specialty, the Korean-style fried chicken and my boyfriend ordered the seafood kimchi bowl. At first sight, the fried chicken looked really good. It turned out to be dry. :( As for the seafood bowl, there was a bunch of different ingredients and it looked good but I didn't get the chance to taste it since there was so much food on the table. They give out complimentary tofu soup, which was a plus. The only good thing about this place is it's affordable and the portions are huge. The flavors are only okay. I had high hopes for this restaurant because of the reviews I've read and because it has been recommended by a few of my friends. Overall the food and service is okay, but I don't think I'll come back here anytime soon.", "author": "Anne Y."}

Surprisingly, there was no line. Usually when we drove by, there would be a group of people waiting outside. But this time there were actually tables available and this was a Saturday around 7pm! We got lucky. We had no idea how big proportions would be. It was just my friend, boyfriend, and myself eating. We ordered the Kal Bi (short ribs to die for!), Seafood Pancake, and the fried chicken. The seafood pancake was a lot bigger than we expected. This was WAY more than enough food because we got tofu soup with our meal too! We didn't know that it came with it. So that was a nice little treat because it was very GOOOD! Overall, we really liked the food here and we will definitely go back for more! The only thing that bothered me was that the menus were really sticky. Probably because they leave them close by the tables near everyone's food and dirty fingers.", "author": "Steph C."}

I haven't been here for about 8-9 months and everything seems to have changed.  Maybe a change in chef?  Everything I ordered was SALTY!  Is salt on sale?  All the side dishes were loaded with sodium.  I swear it didn't taste like that before.  I ordered my favorite Kalbi and it wasn't grilled properly and it pieces were cut differently, but the taste was still good.  We also ordered the rice cake w/noodle, which was extremely salty and the tofu w/ beef stew, which was good.  They gave us two small pieces of broiled mackerel for free, which was ok, but I remember they'd used to give us the whole fish for free!  Also, the onion pancake that they used to give you as a free appetizer was gone!  Sigh....I think I'm going to have to start looking for another korean place....", "author": "Katniss B."}
