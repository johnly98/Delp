Two Spanish speaking women came in 5 minutes after our two top did and they had their drinks in hand and orders taken before our drinks were delivered. \nLike I said, the food was good.. I had the super burrito and it was so tasty, contained nothing but fresh ingredients but when it was rolled, the cook put her finger through the tortilla so when I ate it, it split and fell apart. My co-worker really enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich ordered. Said it was one of the best.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-10", "description": "Came here for the first time on a Sunday around lunchtime for a late breakfast. It was crowded but we got seated immediately at a booth by one of the very friendly waitresses. The crowd seemed like a great mix of locals/regulars and tourists - bustling bar area but not overly cramped. This seemed to be your standard local diner, with a Mexican influence. \n\nThe menu had a lot of great breakfast offerings, with some Mexican breakfast options alongside the standard breakfast/lunch fare. We opted for the the Southwestern omelette, corned beef hash, hash browns, wheat and white breads (the latter which came with our meal). The portions were very generous and easily filled us up. \n\nMy boyfriend was very impressed with his corned beef hash overall, however he was disappointed that his poached eggs were a little overcooked, which he says didn't allow the yolk to flow as freely as he wanted it to. He also thought the mushrooms were an interesting addition to the dish, which he says he usually doesn't see with corned beef hashed. I loved the Southwestern scramble and thought it had a ton of flavor thanks to the chorizo. The omelette was really stuffed with a ton of vegetables and meat, and was the perfect mix of egg and filling. \n\nWe both were huge fans of how the hash browns were cooked - just right in terms of crispiness and flavor! Each dish also came with two piece of toast cut in half, with both strawberry and blueberry jam and butter. This simple side really complemented the meal well.\n\nWe'll definitely be coming back here in the future. Seems like the perfect way to start your weekend day, regardless of how late you're getting started.\n\n***A rather random note, but this place seemed to also be very handicapped accessible, with a designated handicapped table and many of the booth tables being longer with what seemed like great spaces for wheelchairs or even high chairs for children.", "author": "Jenny D."}

And yet with all its glaring and frustrating flaws, I find myself returning to Red Cafe.\nWell, partly because I live nearby... BUT that aside, the place is almost always bustling with customers. So then how can they continually keep their doors open and seats filled? It's because Red Cafe, like many small restaurants in the Mission, is food by the people for the people. It's simple traditional Mexican breakfast for the locals. You will not see sightseers or tourists walking in here for brunch, especially when they could just hop over to the flashier taquerias across the street. No, rather you will see Mission residents greeting each other and the staff and enjoying simple food like this that keeps the spirit of the neighborhood alive.\n\nAt least, that's what I try to tell myself. I honestly can't in good faith give the food anything higher than a 2.5/5. The only times I haven't regretted my faith in the establishment after receiving the bill is when I've ordered oatmeal pancakes, which are admittedly quite delicious. I mean $4.50 for a cup of not-so-fresh orange juice is pretty outrageous. This is probably a spot to avoid unless you've exhausted all the other breakfast options in the area, in which case you are probably a local by then and Red Cafe welcomes you with open doors and meh food.", "author": "Stephen C."}

I found this place because I was hungry prior to a job interview nearby, and since I first walked in I fell in love! Since then, I've only ordered the Platanos con Casamiento because this is all I need. It's a small humble diner, and often times there is a wait outside, but the wait isn't very long. Due to its small location, there is a small amount of employees, but they do a good job of checking in on you and getting you served in a timely manner. \n\nI noticed someone else complained about the beans in their review. That person clearly doesn't know beans. The refried beans here are amazing! I love that they are not super thick; these are easier to eat. Different cultures make their refried beans differently, and it's also dependent on individual family cultures as well. Some like their refried beans thick enough to form a ball, and some like it thinner in consistency. Even when I make refried beans they come out different every time depending on my mood and how I want them that day. \n\nAlso, someone was attempting to degrade this diner due to its \"quality\" of food. This is a diner, not a Michelin star restaurant, so calm your bougie bootie down. Makes me mad when people try to rate humble establishments when they only go to expensive bougie restaurants. \n\nAnyways, this place is awesome!

Had we been informed of the charge when we ordered it we might still have opted for it - but we should have been informed.\n\nWe were also charged extra without notice for the chopped up pepper my wife asked to be added to her dish.\n\nBack to the beans - they were so liquid that it they seemed like the water remaining after boiling pinto beans. To add insult, the owner who told us there were no other options sat down right next to us with a plate full of plump beans.

Although there was a little bit of a wait, the timing all worked out well especially with our slightly larger size group (5) for the small place. Food was quick and portions were a good size. \nMenu is very Mexican / American.\n\nI had the Chilaquiles, which were probably the least authentic style I've had before but the flavors were all good though. I wish I had added meat to them though. It needed a bit more substance. \nNachos were a great portion and looked great. \nMy sister and Grandma both had omelets and they were both happy with those. \nMy mom had the Huevos Rancheros- I didnt get a good view of them but she said she enjoyed them. \n\nOverall a happy bunch", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Sandwiches and burgers come with a side of your choice. The food comes out pretty quickly, and the the servers are very friendly. She opted for the croissant sandwich with onion rings and I got the veggie burger with french fries. The onion rings and fries weren't great - a both a bit soggy. The croissant sandwich was toasted and looked pretty good. My veggie burger was enormous, stuffed with veggies and a veggie patty.

The green salsa they put on my plate was the most acidic thing I've ever had. No spice, so flavor, just acid. I'm so disappointed. How can anyone seriously put that on a plate and be proud of it? I feel offended that the people patroning the restaurant think this is what Mexican food is.\n\nI didn't return the plate because it's a small family owned business. The servers were alright.

My roomie Mal G and I struggled for about a half hour, trying decide where to eat on Sunday morning within walking distance of our place. Mission Beach Cafe, too far. Local's Corner, too formal. St Francis Fountain, been there 100 times. Who knew breaking fast could be so mentally labor intensive? We called on the help of our pal KK who had stayed over to give us some input, as Mal attended to her horribly hungover boyfriend. \n\nWe landed on Red Cafe and treked on over. I didn't really know what to expect, as the menu has some odd grammatical pairings (Grill Cheese, Eggs Sandwich), but whatever, it looked good enough and the place was packed. We waited for about 10 minutes before being seated and ordered coffees as we browsed the menu. Mal and I wanted something light, so we split the Carne Deshilada ($9.59) which we had never heard of, but for the sake of trying something new and based on  the description of the dish, this seemed to be a solid choice. KK ordered the Breakfast Burrito ($7.99) with ham.\n\nThe Carne Deshilada was so freakin' good, guys. Though the presentation was different than expected, the flavors were outstanding. It was basically shredded steak  mixed with scrambled eggs with peppers and onions, served with rice, refried beans, and a flour or corn tortilla. We went with flour and it was a good choice. The shredded steak was juicy, sweet, savory, and the beans and rice rounded out the dish. We made little burritos and then I ate the rest with my fork. I added some Tapatio and Tobasco for spice and it was seriously delish. KK ate up her breakfast burrito quickly and said it was grand.\n\nEverything was fresh and hot, coffee was refilled regularly, the staff was super nice, and the price was not too bad.

She mumbled some strange thing to me about an extra wait and I said \"you have to cook the rice or something?\" And she said \"we have no substitutions!\" So I said \"Ohhh you mean like you charge more for rice instead of hashbrowns?\" And she said yes so I said just give me the hashbrowns, as the price was already ridiculously high ($9). My husbands chilequilles was not made correctly, was skimpy and came with a cup of beans so watery you needed a straw. Our server walked behind the counter and was clearly talking about me to her coworker, it was soo obvious, I was pretty confused about what exactly I'd done to offend her cuz it happened within seconds of us walking in. My husband finished his food and about 5 mins later mine arrived. I gave her back the warm canned soda she had given me because I didn't want to drink it warm nor did I want to use the cup of ice that had a crumpled used sugar packet tossed in the bottom under the ice. She shot me a dirty look and walked away. My food was inedible. It was water soup. The eggs were ok but covered in canned tomato sauce and a pool of water, the same water-consistency beans and some soggy bland, oily hashbrowns oh and some really bad, cold tortillas. When she came back 10 minutes after I took 3 bites of food and put my SPOON down (yes I had to use a spoon) she grabbed my plate and said \"u finished\" I said \"can I have a box?\" because I didn't want to waste an entire plate of food, I could probably doctor it up at home. She tossed a wrapper and a salsa cup on my plate an turned around so I scoffed \"umm ok\" and she said \"what\" and I said \"I asked u to box that\" and she said \"do u want another one?\" So I said no because I didn't want whatever slop she was planning on spitting in. She brought the bill and didn't even discount it. She threw trash on my full plate of food that I wanted to-go!  I wanted to talk to a manager but all the people working there appeared to be waitresses and cooks so I'm sure talking to anybody else wouldn't have done anything. We gave her a $2 tip on a $20 bill, my husband put down $4 but I took $2 away and put it I. My purse because she didn't deserve ANYTHING! I'm so annoyed that we even left $2! My husband agreed that she didn't deserve anything but he doesn't care about money so he would just have soon left her a good tip. \nIn a nutshell this horrible server took out money and threw my full plate of food in the garbage. Never again. Mission's kitchen is soooo much better even on their worst day!", "author": "Emma H."}

It had the best coffee and fresh dishes cooked to perfection with highly attentive staff. Over the last three months we noticed a lot of changes in staff and service.  We used to crave this meal and made it a weekly visit.  Now I would not recommend a visit or even consider it as my top 3 choices for a meal. \n\nSome examples of the decline is most of the staff is standing behind the counter while the tables are full and not serving patrons refills on coffee or drinks. My last visit I actually had to get up and bring my cup to the counter just for a refill and they did not even seem embarrassed or offer an apology.  Huge decline in service and attention to detail.  The staff needs to really take the initiative and ensure the patrons are being  served. This is probably the second biggest let down since the last 3 months. \n\nThe first biggest let down is the change in quality of food. The ingredients are still fresh and delicious but the food is coming out burnt or overcooked. I ordered chilaquiles and got basically a bag of cooked tortilla chips with one egg. It was not gross but greatly deminished in quality and taste. My girlfriend ordered an omlete with bacon and cheese and the egg was burned and brown and super dry. These are huge no nos in the restaurant business.  Highly disappointed in the declinethe staff offered to remake the food but by this time we were tired of the wait and so disappointed it was easier to take the food to go and give it to the homeless. \n\nOverall this place used to be a 5 star establishment but now I am sure the drop brings it to only 2 1/2 stars. For the price wait and quality I would suggest to keep looking for another place for breakfast because reds cafe is on a slippery slope down to 1 star.", "author": "Roman R."}

The food we got was good, but the service was abysmal.  One of our group got something other than what he ordered, but instead of rectifying the situation, the waitress argued with him and the other 3 of us who heard his order.  Then when faced with the opportunity to admit 4 people were probably right, she brought in reinforcements (other employees) to help her disagree with our collective memory.\n\nOrders get messed up - that's not insurmountable.  Mounting a defense to prolong just doing the right thing is a shitteous customer service tactic.  Especially for a basic omelette.

It sounds like something I would make out of desperation because I ran out of bologna and was too lazy to go to the 7-11 and get some. Sure enough, they serve it here in a French roll for $6.95, and it tastes like it came from a can of Mary Kitchen, which is not a bad thing if you ask me. They put in a scrambled egg, lettuce, tomato and plenty of mayo. It came with some thick onion rings that were crunchy-greasy-good (see photo). \n\nJamie W. didn't fare as well with the $6.25 House Burger (see photo). While the meat patty was good enough, he said the bacon tasted pretty stale and chewy, and the fries were not too satisfying considering how many of the onion rings he tried to pilfer off my plate. The pupusa was probably the least controversial item on our respective plates. Not made with the tender mamacita hands to be found at El Zocalo, they were decent enough at $1.99 each. Mine had mushrooms and cheese inside (see photo), and it was the only hint that we were in the Mission. \n\nService was on the tentative side like he wasn't sure when to come back to pick up plates or refill glasses. Instead, he simply stared at us from a distance. Regardless, I like the dinerish set-up here (see photo) and could see myself coming back for breakfast. They offer Mexican food but don't seem to emphasize it given the number of taquerias in the vicinity including the one we were intending to visit, La Taqueria, which was overstuffed with waiting customers across the street. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...corned beef hash sandwich? \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...semi-old-fashioned diner with a counter and semi-private booths \nSERVICE - 3 stars...on the tentative side \nTOTAL - 3 stars...greasy spoonish option in the Mission with some Latin color", "author": "Ed U."}

I'm sure I could find her, or maybe she finally moved to New Orleans.\n\nOne of the things I like about living in San Francisco is that it's easy to find people, but it's easy to lose them as well.  Almost every other month, I see people I know at random spots:  on BART, crossing Fillmore Street, getting off the 24-Divisadero at McAllister.  I recognize many more people constantly.  And while it is nice to reconnect with old friends, it's also nice to just acknowledge acquaintances with a smile.  No need to go down the rabbit hole of social convention, because, honestly, do I really care what the foreperson from my month-long jury trial is up to now?  I know he lives a block away from me, and it was nice to see him, but I don't need to follow him on Twitter or hang out with him and his girlfriend or check out his new motorcycle.\n\nRed Cafe is really good.  The vegetarian options are good for a Mission breakfast place that's actually in the Mission--on Mission Street, not in one of the hipster Bantustans.\n\nThe place is hopping, but the service is up to the task.  The counter is way too cramped, so don't sit there, especially in the middle.  There should be windows onto 25th Street, but I assume this space used to be a store, and they didn't want thieves to have too many ways to break in.  But forget about everything related to the decor.  It's really good, and it's clean, from open kitchen to tables to bathrooms.  It's a little pricier than I thought it would be, but big portions mean it's a decent value.\n\nSo thank you, Chicken Farmer.  I hope all your injuries are healing well.  Know that you have at least two loyal fans:  me and Tim, whom I haven't seen since I randomly spotted him on a southbound BART train about a year ago.  Did you know he played rugby at Georgetown?

I was hosting my sister from San Diego and we were walking around on a Sunday morning after our first brunch plans fell through. We stumbled upon this place and decided to check it out. There was 2 or 3 parties waiting outside but we were addressed immediately as we walked up. They said 15 min wait time, we were sat in 5. Given our drinks immediately, (the entire place was full) and our orders were taken as soon as we were ready. The owner/GM even refilled our waters. I have worked many food service jobs and it was clear that the entire staff cared about our experience. Not only we were treated with kindness, our dishes were delicious and CHEAP, especially for the Mission... they could double their prices and that place would still do business. Felt like a piece of home eating here and I will definitely be back.", "author": "Carlee K."}

Some of the booths are small that they only fit 2 people, which makes it kinda nice, cause it sucks when I'm taking up a huge booth and I don't really need it. Also, if your lucky, someone comes in to play live music! Ahhh.. the life.\n\nTo be honest, I've only had breakfast here and would recommend it. Lunch is a different story.", "author": "Jessica H."}

(I arrived at 10:30 a.m. on a Sunday). \n\nMy friend and her 2-year-old son arrived and the wait staff was awesome. They repeatedly picked up and replaced the spoon the boy dropped despite us saying it was unnecessary.\n\nNext, the food. Wonderful. The chilaquiles, the huevos rancheros, the oatmeal pancakes. I didn't care for the side order of plantains because I thought they were too greasy. But I felt that was more about me, than the restaurant and can't ding them as a result.\n\nThe prices were great.

They bring the green sauce and beans to the table to pour over the top, instead of doing it in the kitchen and making a soggy mess.

Yes, they were very oatmealy, but they taste like nothing more than, yes, oatmeal, and a little flour, cooked in lots of butter. Tasty, but again, not spectacular, and I'm betting nowhere near as healthy as you would think or hope.\nAnd speaking of buttery, my scrambled eggs we pretty much broiled (though cooked nicely) in it. The flavor overpowered the usual strong flavor of eggs. And it was served in a small pool of butter. Clarified, I think, since it never congealed on my plate.\nThe accompanying sausages were good, but deep fried. Suffice it to say the breakfast nearly stopped my heart despite my leaving half of it.\nTo top it off, they charged me an extra two bucks to sub oatmeal pancakes for buttermilk pancakes when on the menu the oatmeal ones are cheaper. Doesn't make much sense, does it? But I can't be too pissed because the server warned me that it might cost more. Still doesn't make sense.\nAlso, service was patchy. I waited a smidge too long to get my check and then receipt.\nSo why two star instead of one? Their onion rings. Delicious, perfectly fried, cornmeal crusted pieces of heaven they were.

And throughout our meal, there was always a line to get in.\n\nOnce we got seated, at the counter : ), our waitress took our drink order of a double latte and coffee. I love coffee! So, I know good coffee. The coffee was good and strong and the latte was excellent. It almost had a caramel taste to it.\n\nWhen she dropped off our coffees our waitress then took our order: French toast, Latin scrambled, and country scrambled. 15 minutes later she returned with a magnificent site of food. The eggs were soft, fluffy and NOT dried out (like some places).  On the country, there were tons of chopped ham, green onion, and 1/2 an avocado. YUM!  The French toast was thick, but not Texas toast size. Sometimes Texas toast is too thick.  Anyway back to the French toast, it was cinnamonnie, a little eggy, crispy around the edges, and soft in the middle. \n\nThe only cons:\n1) The wait to be seated. However, I'm not counting that, because it\n     was New Year's Day and nobody wants to cook on NYD.\n2) The toast was cold and I had to put on the butter. Spreading butter\n     on cold toast not so good.\n\nPrices:\nI forgot to write down the prices and I cannot find a menu online, however, nothing we had was over $9.00.\n\nOverall:\nIt is a great place to have breakfast at a decent price!

To start off, the breakfast burrito cost $7.99 plus tax. I don't mind paying any cost as long as the quality is there. The choice for meat are sausage, bacon or ham. I requested if I could have all three meats but with equal amounts so as if I only had one. They told me I would have to be charged an extra $2.99 and I said ok. So this breakfast burrito is now $11 plus tax. I get home to open my to go container and I have a burrito not even half the size of an el Farolito regular burrito that cost $7. I tell myself it must be the quality and that's why it's so small. I take a bite out of this kid's meal and it's mostly egg with barely had any kind of meat in it. Remember they charged me an extra $2.99 because i wanted the mixture of all three that they offered.

I liked that they aren't cloying as many pancakes can be and I got them with fruit which made it yummier. \nHuevos Rancheros:  +1 for the slightly spicy salsa roja and delicious refried beans - but the beans are pounded, almost sauce-like, so there's no texture to enjoy.

Previous experiences included great, friendly service along with delicious chilaquiles and breakfast quesadilla. This morning, something went awry. Red Cafe has been busy and bustling every time I've been there, and today was no different. Friendly, helpful waiter took our orders but when the food came something was terribly wrong. \nChilaquiles, check. Plantains, check. I brought my mother today and she ordered the hash, which comes with poached eggs and toast. First on the table: cold, soggy toast that had the crusts detached and thrown on top of the pile of sadness. That got sent back, and new toast came with a smile from the waiter. OK. Then the hash came, and one poached egg was a hard fossil while the other egg had the yolk broken and oozing its innards before the plate even got introduced to the table top. I didn't notice this because I was busy digging into the chilaquiles. The waiter was called over and informed of this. My mom clearly told him she would go ahead and eat it, but that it seemed like this was a mistake on the part of the kitchen to let something so sloppy come out to service. He seemed confused as to what the problem was at first, presumably because a little broken yolk is common to serve up to the customers there. I don't know. But then he starts excusing the issue by blaming rushed service. There's no need for that. Just apologize, offer to replace and move on when that offer is turned down. Customers just want to feel like their complaint is heard.\nMy mom asked that the manager be informed too, since all she was getting was sloppy plate after sloppy plate. The manager was the worst part of the whole experience. He came over ready to fight, it seemed. He opened with accusations, and seemed angry when he asked my mom what she wanted, saying they already offered to replace it or take it off the bill if she didn't want to eat it and that he didn't \"want to argue\" about this. She said she didn't want to argue either, she just wanted to say that this isn't what should be allowed to be served and she wanted to bring it to their attention. He said if she kept talking and \"arguing\" he would have to call the police. Frankly, I'm sorry he didn't because they would have laughed in all our faces. Voices got raised and he finally went away but presumably not because he realized he was being a jerk since he never said one word of apology.\nThe check came, and our waiter apologized again. Since he had maintained a friendly demeanor the whole time, I don't hold anything against him. The hash was indeed off the bill, which was very nice of him since it was not something we asked for. Bottom line, kitchen needs to look at what they're sending out and management needs to take a chill pill.", "author": "Whippy C."}

Eggs, rice & beans, fried plantain,a dollop of sour cream & a bit of farmer's cheese...served with  either corn or flour tortillas. I think it's their signature dish on the Latin American menu. I order it every time and every time someone I take asks the server for a recommendation, this is it. So... signature dish.\n\nThey have other latin american/mexican/nicaraguan/salvadorean standards. I love pupusas and they have those too. Loroco and cheese. Good & different menu item- order it.\n\nFor 'american' food, the oatmeal pancakes are great, too. I've shared a short stack of those each time I've gone. glutton. A great alternative to buttermilk, buckwheat or cornmeal.\n\nThe service is great.

The menu is big and has your basic breakfast and lunch options alongside some Mexican additions; everything I've had has been tasty and filling.  Favorites of my friends and I include the corned beef hash, the French Slam, and the BLT.  Mission denizens need look no further for a quality, basic breakfast joint.", "author": "Alan R."}

The place was full on a Monday afternoon and getting a table was a little difficult but I did get one 2 to 3 minutes after arriving. The young lady that served me while we waited for my guests was very patient and very courteous so customer service was ever so present! They have a wide selection of food on the menu including breakfast items which I would have thought would not have been served after 11 a.m. But yet they were available to the customers. So even though my colleague was late they did not mind so much that I was holding up a table for 4 and they did serve us promptly once she got there. Apparently there are also items Latino menu type items that were  not on the menu so you should ask or possibly there may be a secondary menu. All in all a great selection for food the food was presented in an appetizing way and I cannot even begin to say thank you to the server she just was ever so on top of things!

But now that you've read this, you aren't allowed to do that any more.\n\nA mix between an American and Latino diner, it's the most unique combo I've seen of the two in my time here in SF.  (What it's NOT is \"Tex-Mex\" or anything resembling that)  Think traditional American egg breakfasts with a side of tortilla, plantains, and beans (casamiento platanos) or breakfast burrito with a side of hash browns.  Not to mention the SF staple of freshly-squeezed orange juice -- something that transcends even the highest border wall.\n\nWhat I love about Red Cafe the most (aside from the above-mentioned side of plantains) is its authentic feel...Latino families enjoying brunch after Mass and it being a Latino-run business in general.  I hope we gringos can find a way to enjoy it without taking over and pushing out the OGs.  \n\nI recently found out the name is derived from the owner's home country:  The coffee beans are ripe for picking when they turn red.\n\nPROS:\n-close to 24th/Mission BART\n-never a too-long wait (max 20 minutes)\n-authentic and good-quality food\n-plaintains for breakfast\n\nCONS:\n-street musicians can sometimes take over the place", "author": "Em C."}

I wanted something hearty, not terribly expensive or with a scene (Love Bugaloo but  a little \"hip\"  for my mood. )  and really  near BART..  I Yelped  options, remember seeing the cafe on my Mission excursions, and decided  to give it a try.  (I wanted to waste no time looking for a place.)    This was on a weekday at like 7:45, so  it  wasn't  at all crowded.  The first  thing I did was grunt for coffee.:)  After that neccessity  was taken care  of  I looked at the menu for a quick minute.  Through My Yelping  I  had  an idea of a few items I would particularly  enjoy.    After  looking at the menu I  decided on the corned beef hash.  It  had  some vegeteables  so maybe it was slightly healthy (LOL, right.)  Also worried that my other  main idea , a breakfast buurrito may get over my nice  going to the capitol clothes if I tried to pick it up!  It took like  5 minutes for the hash  to come out.  It  was piping hot  when it came out, and so, so tasty.  The vegetables were a great addition! It  was  just  what I  needed  .. The has browns  it came were delicious  too.   I sopped up a bit of the hash with the  flour tortillas it came  with also.  VERY  nice.   The coffee wasn't the best, but not the worst and did its job.\n\nThe place wasn't big and I  could see where it could get crowded on the weekend.     I wouldn't  recommend  it if there is more than one person in a wheelchair in your party or l arge groups in general.

Service for the gentlemen is pretty great, the manager woman sometimes not the same. But that is not the reason for the missing stars. Though their food is great. I noticed if you pay with I card they charge additional money on the card, and I know some resturants do that, but I didn't think they did. I knew they did this but usually it was less then 2 dollars so I kept that in mind while I tipped. But when my friend paid, she called me and said we never spent 25 dollars at red cafe. We usually order the same thing, so it should have been 19 dollars, and I saw the credit card statement and it was exactly a 25 dollar charge.

The service has always bordered on shitty, however I put up with it as it was super close and rather tasty.  The last time I ate there however will be my last.  My dining companion had ordered hashbrowns and though the hb here are usually crispy and delicious these were barely cooked.  Ok, when the waiter came by we politely asked if he could put them back on the grill to  crisp them up some.  He did not return with them until we had finished all of our food, and they were still limp and white :-( .  This in and of itself would not be enough to warrant such a dismal review, however when I asked him to take the hashbrowns off the bill as they were not good etc. he argued with me and refused.  I explained that I came in there all the time, which he acknowledged, and that he could either take the 2.45 off the bill (A LOT for a dinky ass order of hashbrowns anyway, no?!?) or that it would be the last time I ate there.  He explained that that was how they served their hashbrowns unless you order them crispy.

Submitting to intense pressure and without an obvious convenient alternative of my own, I ended up walking into this nondescript corner restaurant called Red Cafe for breakfast. Since that initial encounter, I've found myself there another 3 or 4 times but willingly and obviously repentant for the errors of what, in hindsight, appears to have been a lapse in judgment on my part. I am seriously crushing on the plantains and egg dish that comes with the casamiento (rice and beans in a ball). The sweet plantains were the perfect balance when paired with the white cheese that comes with. In my defense, I think that whoever can concoct such a savory dish, deserves a better outwardly appearance.

As for the food: I had the huevos rancheros, listed as Eggs Rancheros - not sure why, since everyone in this town understands huevos, even the more colorful meanings. Anyway... the eggs were over easy with a salsa picante, there were hash browns and refried black beans. I had corn tortillas rather than the other choice which I think was toast. As soon as I ordered \"huevos rancheros\" the waiter started speaking to me in Spanish, which I thought was great since I like to try to stay conversant. Lots of places won't give you the time of day in Spanish unless you don't speak English.\nThe eggs with the salsa were great, the refried black beans had been pureed to within an inch of their lives and the corn tortillas were straight out of a package. I can't really fault them for that, considering the very reasonable menu prices, but the refried beans were soupy on top of having the consistency of baby food (to be kind...ha) So, the bottom line on the food is that it was absolutely nothing special for me this morning, but the service was lovely.

All the fare you would expect at any diner, from burgers, salads, sandwiches to eggs, bacon and pancakes. Throw in some Latin breakfast choices like the Nopales omelet, which I had and it was good, more frittata like and just a bit of cheese melted on the top. Not as greasy as some of the other reviewers suggested. In fact, I find the Pork store greasier and frankly too much food at times. The portions were right on.\n I was alone and sat at the bar with no waiting on a Sunday afternoon. It was busy with just a few places at the counter  where you can watch the ladies cooking. Kind of a change seeing women doing all the cooking and the wait staff a mix of men and women. Lots of staff on hand. The service was attentive and friendly and the Mariachis came in just as I sat down. Not the overwhelmingly loud version I am used to . Very festive. A few songs at the back of the room and then off they went. \nIf you order a sandwich it comes with choice of onion rings, fries or Ceasar salad, which all looked good. I noticed the burgers were hand formed and the meat looked like it had never been frozen. \nIf you don't live in the neighborhood or can't get there easily then don't make a special trip as I am sure you can find a diner in your area, but for us folks in the Mission with limited breakfast/hamburger type choices this is a convenient find and a nice alternative to La Taza  and with wait service.

The service here is very laid back.  We both ordered breakfast burrito with hash browns (the menu said meals come with hash browns unless otherwise noted).  There was no mention of the burritos not including hash browns.  The food was pretty good.  When we got the bill, we were both charged an extra 2 dollars for the hash browns.  I even had a feeling we were going to be charged for them since they took awhile to come out after our main dishes.  just double check how much they are charging you.", "author": "Joey M."}

We didn't have to wait long to eat on a Sunday morning.  The oatmeal pancakes with bananas were good - not the best I've had, but very satisfying for $6.95.  Not a place for big groups, but comfortable for our foursome.  Recommended!", "author": "Jenny G."}

I've had great experiences w/ the owner(s) and staff and coming here has been a near weekly treat for me over the last 9 months. Juevos rancheros, with a side of fresh jalepenos is my favorite dish. The burgers look amazing although I haven't tried them yet. The platanos and casamiento are great. Overall, a perfect lazy Saturday or Sunday late breakfast or lunch spot.", "author": "Brian W."}

It was crowded when we arrived, but we only had to wait 5 min before grabbing a corner spot at the counter. I had the chilaquiles, which were some of the best I've ever tasted.  (crispy tortilla strips and excellent beans and green chili sauce on the side) We also had a side of plantains, which were great on their own and even better when paired with the beans. The portions are hearty - definitely large enough to share, especially if you get something small on the side as well.  We will be back!", "author": "Brynne D."}

Combine that with the fact that the service was solid, the prices are decent, and the location's convenient, and you've got yourself a win.", "author": "Patrick P."}

I lived in Honduras for a while last year and fell in love with these \"stuffed tortillas\".  The curtido, a cabbage salad served with pupusas, is great, just the right amount of vinegar and spice.", "author": "dissipatedfog .."}

I definitely felt it was a popular local breakfast joint with only available seating at the bar. Service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla, orange juice and side of hash browns. First of all I have to say the orange juice was fresh and REAL, I don't know how many times I've been upset by spending 5$ on a small glass of Minute Maid garbage juice. The semi open kitchen design allowed me to watch them cook my meal which is always a bonus. The hash browns were standard, nothing a little salt and pepper can't fix. The quesadilla was not only huge it was delicious, I was unable to eat the entire meal. I packed the leftovers in a bag and enjoyed them later on that evening. I am a fan, if I find myself in the mission again I'll return for breakfast.", "author": "R J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-11", "description": "Red Cafe is what it is.  Its a diner style place.  I have tried the Breakfast Burrito and the Cheeseburger and Fries.  How to really explain??  The Cheeseburger is a nice sized patty, a toasted bun, lettuce, tomato, and a few condiments.  Special sauce, mayo and mustard.  While this all sounds basic, its really simple and tasty.  The is the great burger drip that everyone knows what I am talking about.  There is the almost perfect diner french fries.  And then there is the price.  I got 2 cheeseburgers and fries for less than $13.  Burger and fries.  It is really a way of life.  In the morning the breakfast foods are fantastic.  The breakfast burrito is awesome to behold.  My only complaint about it is they don't have a side of hash browns to accompany the cheesy tasty awesomeness that will soon be entering your body.  But I like to order them and eat bites with or separately.  The service is really quick.  And I actually enjoy the club type music they play inside.  Its like the party in my mouth is dancing with the music.  I go here a lot and so should you!!!   They have a lot of different foods all are pretty decent.", "author": "Jerry V."}

One thing that kind of annoys me: they serve their toast a little cold and undercooked with the butter cold and wrapped in those little foil packets. So by the time you unwrap it and try to get it on your tooast or english muffin or rye, the melting factor has diminished significantly. But that s me...all i do is crush melted butter on toast.", "author": "Galen m."}

Again, based on the reviews of the fellow Yelp reviewers and a massive craving for pancakes all of a sudden, we decided to try it out.  Parking was a bit hard on a Saturday afternoon, however we were not deterred.  Finally finding that free, one-hour parking space (HOORAY!), we walked to Red.  We had the Combinations and Chicken sandwich.  The pancake was delicious!  Possibly because I was famished or my love of sweet hit me right then and there, but that pancake was buttery!  Price was right for two dishes, atmosphere small yet cozy, food was the right portion.  Definitely a \"good eats\" place.", "author": "Restaurant C."}
