We ended up not getting drinks and decided to leave but the friendly bouncer told us to come back during the day to eat the food and try the \"best fish n chips in SF\". The next day at lunch my wife and I were deciding on where to eat for lunch and we decided to try out the Irish Bank. We ordered fish n chips, chicken nachos, and an Irish coffee. \n\nThe bartender was incredibly friendly and attentive and got us our food and drinks quickly. The fish and chips were actually very tasty. The fish seemed to be fresh because the cod was not fishy. It was also breaded nicely and was very fresh. The chicken nachos were not good. We were hungry and ate them all but nothing about them was anything that good. The Irish coffee was also not good. It was much waterier than it should have been and lacked the needed alcohol and chocolate. The speed of the food service was good and the bartender was pretty good considering she had the entire interior of the bar/restaurant to take care of. As for \"the best fish and chips in SF\", I have nothing to compare it to in SF. They were good though. They were not fishy and tasted fresh to my wife and me.", "author": "Nico M."}

Skip the food.\n\nWe came here for a work happy hour and it was decently packed on a Friday. The patio is one of my favs in the area. It's nothing to look at, but it's spacious and simple and there's always seating. There's a guy that checks ID by the front alley. If you're under 21, you have to stay outside on the patio. \n\nTheir beer selection is okay. Nothing special. I ordered a couple rounds of Smithwicks, which was one of the only Irish beers on tap. They had the usual Guinness, Stella, Harp, Mangers etc. I would love to see them carry more Irish beers on tap.\n\nFor food, we tried a little bit of everything. For apps we tried their Mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and bleu cheese fries. The Mozzarella sticks were generous. It came with way more than the usual 4 or 5. The bleu cheese fries were interesting. It was literally semi melted bleu cheese on steak fries. The fries had no flavor though and the combo of the blue cheese didn't really match that well. Not sure if I would recommend it.\n\nFor mains we tired their Bratwurst and Sauerkraut and their Bangers. The sausages were okay. The outside was fried so it was crispy. The mashed potatoes were interesting. I wasn't sure what they added to it, but it had an after taste, almost chemically, so I did not finish them. My coworker loved it, she claimed they tasted very \"German.\"", "author": "Junella T."}

Overall, it felt like simple comfort food you'd find at home, with lower than average SF prices to match. \n\nThe shepherd's pie was sweet and tomato-y-- almost reminiscent of something you'd find over rice at a Cantonese cafe. Made of ground beef instead of lamb, at $10 it was surely filling. We were able to replace to baked mashed potato top with a side of fries and added curry for $1. The curry was more a thin British / Asian style, as opposed to Indian curries. Tasty. 3.3/5.\n\nThe corned beef was somewhat bland for restaurant food, though the portion was generous. The cabbage was literally boiled cabbage. Horseradish and mustard sauces were fresh and pungent, though standard. 3.3/5, but realistically on taste, a 3/5.\n\nThe entire place felt pretty divey, and there was a distinct lack of windows, which made it feel much later than it was. Service was pretty standard.", "author": "Nicole H."}

The Irish Bank cranks out some delicious beer and delectable eats!\n\nI came here for some grub-a-dub-dub before meeting up with some friends at a nearby bar later on in the evening. First off, this little gem is off the beaten path!  If you're walking down Bush street, you'll pass the Akiko Sushi and make an immediate left on Mark lane. You'll see some outdoor seating and then make a left into the bar. \n\nThe atmosphere just screams divey pub! It's dark and low lit with brick walls and rustic wooden tables and chairs. There's a second room that's separated by a curtain for people who are looking to dine in. The bar is lively with loud music and interactive bartenders! Since I was dining solo, I took a seat at the bar and a cute couple chatted me up and kept me company. \n\nI saw someone order the fish and chips and I knew that I just haaaad to have it! The smell alone was making my mouth water. I also started out with one of those specialty cocktails which was a Smirnoff sourced pineapple Mule! It was a delicious tasting cocktail; it wasn't overly sweet but just sweet enough. I later had a Harp Lager (you know I had to get some beer!) and it was perfectly light and crisp and went perfectly with my fish and chips!\n\nSpeaking of those fish and chips; they were the STAR of the show! The chips were nice and thick but weren't dry and had a nice season to them. But that FISH! OMG! Crispy fried HEAVEN! It was so remarkable! Some of the best that I've had in a long time. And the creamy tarter sauce that they served with it?! A winning combo indeed!\n\n The fish was crispy, flaky, and flavorful! The batter was just perfect, and even after barely finishing my meal, it left me wanting more. The portion size was hefty! I guess it left quite an impression on the couple sitting next to me because they ordered it right after mine came. Only difference was that they spilt theirs' while I devoured mine all by myself! Miss Piggy don't need NO help when it comes to finishing her meals!\n\nThe bartenders here are so fun and entertaining! They were laughing and cracking jokes the entire time and it was so fun! I would love to try more of their beers during my next visit and possibly a different entree if my fish and chips craving doesn't get the best of me next time.", "author": "Shayla B."}

Located at Mark Lane near Grant Avenue and Chinatown's Gate Entrance at Bush Street, the Irish Bank Bar & Restaurant brings the customers to enjoy and taste their finest Irish cuisines and assortments of drinks from Guinness and finest cocktails every day and night! The atmosphere is very laid back and active as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to a local alley bar with tons of tables and seats outside, and on the inside, there's some good vintage wooden interior Irish designs from the past filled with photographs and classic signs across the whole room.\n\nThe bartenders, security officers and servers are doing a fine job for accommodating the customers like me an amazing service despite the busiest environment on a bust Saturday afternoon on 3/11/2017. I just hope they need to improve their speediness in the near future someday, but other than that, no issues so far.\n\nSince I haven't got a chance to try on one of their foods due to a larger early St. Patrick's Day party, I ordered a glass of beer of Lagunitas IPA at the main bar side. As I drank it, that beer is simply refreshing and cooling which it gives the best aromas of pale ale and bolder taste. Sensational!\n\nParking at Irish Bank Bar & Restaurant can be difficult to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the meantime, the Irish Bank Bar & Restaurant is a good, averaged local Irish Pub that I've ever enjoyed and visited there for the first time in 26 years. Perfect for friends and co-workers gathering! A fine visit, and I'll be back for more to try it again! My rating: 3 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

We walked down the alley and it opened up into the outside seating for this bar.  Dating an Irishman, of course we had to try it.  Opening at 11:30, we were two of three patrons who entered as the doors opened.  It was my honey's birthday too.  Drinks were great, tried a new Irish whiskey, Slane.  We shared chicken nachos and those were delicious.  The waiter was cordial and helpful.  The vibe was awesome.  Jazz filled the airwaves while the dimly lit bar displayed tons of Irish photos, news articles and other memorabilia on the walls.  We purchased a rugby jersey there and it was $45 and excellent quality.\n\nWill definitely go back when in the city again.\n\nOnly criticism:  We ordered an Irish Car Bomb, to celebrate his birthday and the waiter did NOT pour equal amounts of Guinness in each glass and in mine, it was very foamy (I know...Guinness doesn't have foam, but it was all head and no beer.)", "author": "KT T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-10", "description": "I went here at around 8pm after having eaten nearly nothing all day, desperate to sate my hunger. I opted for a simple burger and fries, but, noting that the menu described the house burger in no words beyond \"8 oz. burger\", I decided to ask what exactly was on it. The bartender answered that it's all the usual, \"you know, lettuce, tomatoes, whatever.\" I said that sounded good, and that I'd take one. \"Do you want cheese on it?\" the bartender responded. Sure, I affirmed. \"Okay, that'll be a dollar extra.\" \n\nI approved the one-dollar cheese surcharge, but my stomach pre-emptively filled with dread: being charged extra for cheese is never a good sign. \n\nEventually my food arrived. The fries were crisp, oil- and salt-free, not too powdery inside, all while maintaining the distinct smell of deep-fried potato. They weren't outstanding, but certainly decent enough for snacking on. \n\nThe burger had been served open-faced, with one side containing the patty and the hundred-cent-cheese-surcharge slice of cheddar on top, which looked suspiciously rectangular and translucent. I'm quite sure that, legally speaking, this was not cheese, rather some kind of imitation-cheese-esque substitute in the vague spirit of cheddar. \n\nI folded the two halves of the burger into one, and bit into it. I wolfed down a few thoughtless bites -- I was very hungry -- but eventually  I started to register a kind of waxy flavor. Intermingled with the normal taste of char on a patty was the distinct flavor of freshly molten wax (yes, like candlewax). At first I dismissed it -- it might just be a peculiarity of this patty -- but after a few more bites, it dawned on me that maybe this was indicative of a health risk, so I stopped. I couldn't pin down whether the distinct flavor of wax came from the patty, the cheese-in-name-only, or the bun, but in any case, this avant-garde flavor served as a whole armada of red flags. \n\nBeyond that, the burger wasn't very tasty anyway, so I picked the remaining avocado (two dollar surcharge, by the way) out of the burger with my fork, and left. \n\nThat's right. I had not eaten anything all day, and I did not finish my meal here. I made it barely halfway through. I went home and ate toast and ice cream instead.", "author": "John L."}

And it's SF--in many cases, a tiny shot can run upwards to $17. I also don't know any bar where the going rate for a shot of Connemara is $8. So you can get your socks knocked off with a generous double for a mere $16, which is usually the going rate for a standard watered down cocktail at every other bar in a mile radius. Worth it. \n\nHard to believe a quaint little place is tucked away so close to Union Square. The inside venue is a little meh, primarily because the music is ridic loud, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but the tunes are all customer selected on the e-jukebox. So you get to hear your standard crappity pop and bad oldies blaring through what is a low-key Irish bar. My suggestion is to sit in the adorable alleyway. There are heaters during the colder months so you won't freeze. Although service is a little slow out here, it's worth not having to shout your conversations over Taylor Swift and Katy Perry tunes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-01", "description": "This is an irish style bar/pub kinda sorta not really in the financial district/union square.\n\nStreet parking only, but there are some parking garages not too far away.\n\nIt's got some unique things about it both good and bad.\n\nThe bar has all the basics for a decent irish pub, long wooden topped bar, rail footrest, clips for hanging your wrap, jacket or bag on underneath the bar seating (perfect for leaving your stuff behind!), and of course a fair amount of snug.\n\nThe have about a dozen taps of beer all of which, excepting the required local cali style IPA thingys (Lagunitas), would not be out of place in any Irish pub in the home country. I do note that the Harp is not necessarily the same as what you'll find across the pond. In the US it's brewed in Canada, as that's more profitable then shipping it from Europe. I can't tell the difference, but then it's been 15 years since I was overseas. The irish/scotch whisky selection is profound and the wine selection isn't bad, although if you're drinking wine in an irish pub, you have bigger issues then the depth of the wine collection.\n\nAssuming you don't want to linger at the bar, there's a collection of dining tables and what would be patio seating except for the fact it's in the alley. I'm not a big fan of the alley seating. Sure, you can be as loud as you want, and if you're a smoker it's a better place to break San Francisco's public smoking laws then inside, and you can barely see the dumpster but you're in a fricken alley. In San Francisco. Without going into rat infested, pee stained, homeless drug addict using, details alleys in San Francisco are not famous as being a super fun place to hang out. \n\nThe food is pretty good, verging on great. Thier shepherd's pie is a perfect rendition of the type. If you have a shepherd's pie craving this place will serve as perfect a plate as you'll find anywhere.\n\nPricing is steep even by the area's standards. Along with the alley seating I consider this another weak spot. The whisky wall commands premium pricing so a low to mid range quality shot will run you 11 dollars or so. The pint happy hour pricing is six bucks a pint. Food starts at roughly 20 dollars a plate. So a couple drinks and a meal will most likely be around 50 dollars for you.", "author": "Steven W."}

I definitely had quite a bit of both when I lived in Dublin.

Semi-outdoor seating in the alley can be competitive on busy nights but the servers come by pretty frequently. Nothing necessarily remarkable about the food here but its reasonable pub grub with fairly large servings.

I come to The Irish Bank for St Patrick's because this place is convenient to my work about two blocks away.  That's convenient because if I needed to the bathroom I would use the bathroom at my work instead of standing at the long line at The Irish Bank. St Patrick's Day Weekend at The Irish Bank is a euphoric atmosphere. The setting is at an alley full of people drinking beer and dancing to the music. Two weeks ago I brought my nephew, cousin, and brother in law for St Patrick's Day Weekend. We had a great time unwinding and enjoying the celebration.\n\nEven though I have been here for St Patrick's Day Weekend I haven't eaten here despite it's only about two blocks away from my work. I ate here last Friday for lunch. I read about the Yelp review of the bleu cheese fries - an interesting concept I thought. I ordered fish and chips. Instead of the regular fries I substituted for the bleu cheese fries. The fish was moist, but I wish the batter was crunchier. The bleu cheese on the fries doesn't make the fries soggy as melted cheese would. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the bleu cheese fries as nothing stood out in flavor. \n\nI noticed a table next to me a customer ordered the Irish beef stew. I thought that looked more appetizing than my fish and chips. However I wasn't going to order the Irish Beef Stew right after I ordered the fish and chips. So I came here last Tuesday and ordered the Irish beef stew. On the side I also ordered Irish bacon, which is similar to Canadian bacon. The Irish beef stew had slices of potato, but also topped with mashed potato. I felt the dish had too many potatoes and not enough chunks of beef - I counted four pieces of beef. I actually enjoyed the Irish bacon more. The grilled bacon brought out the flavor.\n\nSo I experienced eating and drinking at The Irish Bank. I actually enjoy drinking at The Irish Bank more than eating here. If I come back to The Irish Bank it would be for St. Patrick Day's Weekend instead of eating there for lunch during my lunch break at work.", "author": "Gerald R."}

This pub is as close as I have been to being in an authentic Irish pub in San Francisco. Dark wood, brick walls, leather chairs, wood chairs and history all over the walls. The fellas pouring me Guinness were Irish too! Love....\n\nI have sampled Guinness all over the world, the best place to have it of course is in Dublin. If you can't swing a flight on Aer Lingus, head to the Irish Bank for a delectable pint. This is the best head I have seen in SF. Sorry Napper, the Irish Bank has taken your place. You are my local so I still have love for ya. If stout ain't your thing, try one of the MANY choices of whisky, scotch or other spirits showcased behind the bar. They are in abundance. \n\nThough it was only a Monday night, I've been told that on occasion the pub blocks Marks Alley so bands can play for the crowd.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-02", "description": "I made a Yelp account just to write this review. Sat down for a beer on the patio on a beautiful day. A patron sitting in the patio (a regular, based on how all of the wait staff treated him) light up a cigarette, no more than 10 feet from the door, and smoked it brazenly, blowing smoke into the patio area as if he were smoking a cigar.\n\nAfter a woman had to move closer to me, saying that she could not tolerate the smoke either (and also would not be able to eat nor bring her daughters to eat as she had planned), I went inside to ask a server to ask that they request the patron extinguish it. They made a cursory attempt to ask the regular to extinguish it, although he just held it under the table for the remainder of the cigarette.\n\nAs the woman could no longer handle the smoke still wafting into the patio area, she left abruptly. I moved to the only other open outdoor table -- seating for 10 or so. I sat at the very end. This was approximately 5pm on a beautiful Friday. While I was finishing my beer, a line formed for the patio, and I saw a number of groups leave in vain because there were no longer any \"free\" tables.\n\n10 minutes later, when the man lit a second cigarette, I asked the waiter if they were going to enforce the smoking ban on the patio. The waiter said he \"just got there\" and did nothing. When I still smelled the smoke, this time from across the patio, I finally went inside, despite wanting to enjoy the fresh air of a beautiful day. I asked the manager (owner?) the policy for smoking on the patio. He said smoking it is \"at your own risk\", despite having signs prominently posted that say no smoking within 25 feet of any entrance (city law). I asked for clarification, and he said that if smokers get caught, that it's up to them to deal with the consequences. I asked if that meant the establishment makes any effort to operate consistent with city law, and he said (rather rudely) that \"if we try to get them to put it out, then they just go into the alley and smoke anyway\". When I pointed out that that would be perfectly legal and reasonable, so long they were removed from the entrance/patio area, he just walked away. I would not have taken the time to write this if it were not for the utter indifference and rudeness of this manager (owner)?\n\nI would ask this restaurant, why do you condone your patrons breaking the law? Would you serve an inebriated person more alcohol \"at their own risk\"? What about the risk to the other patrons and employees who have to breathe carcinogenic smoke while they simply wish eat and drink?\n\nIN SUMMARY, avoid this patio if you do not wish to have smoke blown in your face. Avoid the indoors of this establishment if the doors are open and you do not wish to smell smoke.", "author": "D. M."}

I really like this neighborhood (although, that probably makes me uncool because nobody is supposed to like Union Square/FiDi. Mostly people scoff at you when you say that you want to come into this area. But you know what, every neighborhood has gems.) \n\nSo this should be your first (maybe your third as well) stop when you come to this neighborhood. \n\nIt's funny, my wife was a little apprehensive at first because I didn't do a great job of selling the place. She immediately fell in love when she saw the outside. \n\nWe thought about taking some outdoor seating because it was a pretty nice day in February (way to go El Nino) but we decided to look around inside. Because where else would you rather be on a nice day than a dimly lit bar? \n\nWe did stumble into the conversation booth. Which is pretty amazing. I'd like to imagine some high-level conversations going on in this booth. The reality is it's probably seen more \"handys\" than anything else. Our family split the difference by nursing our daughter in there. \n\nWhich, by the way, the staff was really cool about. It's a restaurant, so it's not like we smuggled a child into a bar. Well, sorta. But it's a restaurant, so it's allowed. So we sat in this little booth having the time of our lives. This waitress kept walking by and looking in. Which made me nervous. This is our first child, so I'm all, \"should we not be in here?\" \"Are we going to get kicked out?\" \"Are we parents of the year for this?\" \n\nDon't answer that last one. \n\nBut eventually we got up to leave. The waitress (she might have been the manager) came over and compliments our wee Irish lass. Which was a great relief. The girl (my girl, not the waitress/manager) was extremely complimentary. Which made us feel pretty good because we are trying to do the right thing here. \n\nIf the right thing is spending hours in a bar (AND RESTAURANT) on a bright, Saturday. \n\nHey, at least the sun was still up when we left. \n\nOh yeah, a few other things. Get the Irish breakfast. It's great. And order a Guinness. The pour is amazing. So great. I like Guinness fine. But I don't order it a lot. I did here. I've never had a better pour outside of Gallagher's in Huntington Beach back in 1998. So that's good. \n\nGet a snake bite, too. It's amazing.", "author": "Adam R."}

Then again... I've never been to Ireland, so how would I know? There are two sections to this place, the bar and the restaurant.

Kinda weird but okay. \n\nI ordered the Corned Beef & Cabbage ($12.95) which comes with a side of mashed potatoes. You know they're not doing a great job when the mashed potatoes taste better than the main part of the plate. There was something off about the corned beef. Perhaps it wasn't fresh, or maybe it was the fact that the meat itself was not very flavorful. I was craving corned beef (weird craving, I know) but I was let down. The mashed potatoes were amazing though!\n\nI also tried a little bit of the Shepherds Pie ($9.00) which tasted super beefy, but perhaps that's the way they intended it to be.

I was pleasantly surprised though. Chicken was lightly seasoned and everything was fresh. I always love salads that have some fruit in it for a little something sweet and this one had pear! Also candied walnuts. Good size and a healthy alternative if you don't want the typical Irish food. A little pricey though at $11 compared to other items on the menu.\n\nI also had some of the fries that came with my coworker's fish and chips. They were just okay. Thick cut so they were soft fries, but not crisp/crunchy on the outside the way I like my thick fries.\n\nThe only thing I found inconvenient was that they only take 2 credit cards per table.

The venue itself is divided in half, with the bar occupying the initial half of the venue, and the restaurant, the latter half. Coming here for a birthday party this past Saturday, the bar was bustling, but not crowded, which I suspect was mostly due to the holidays.\n\nThey have a decent selection of liquor and beer on tap, but don't expect \"klassier\" liquor like 151 to be on hand. And while they have a number of specialty cocktails, including nightly specials, that are made fairly stiff, don't expect the quality and craftsmanship you'd get at a place like Rickhouse or Zero Zero.\n\nPrices aren't bad either, with most cocktails running around the $8 price point, and service, while more \"all-business\", is not unfriendly either.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - So, contrary to the business details as of this writing, The Irish Bank is NOT wheelchair accessible, as there are a good 3-5 steps to traverse at the entrance, without any alternative way to get inside the venue. That said, the bouncer was kind enough to help lift me up, with the help of another friend at the party. Once inside, expect the usual accessibility challenges of a bar, with high bar counters, crowds, and small spaces. That said, their tables are all at normal height, so be quick to snag one if you need it.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, so I can't comment.", "author": "Johnny W."}

There were, maybe, 20 of us in an inside room at the Irish Bank. Other than our group, there was only 1 couple in the large room. It may be that the inside bar was also busy and the outdoor patio busy as well.\nA waiter came by to take orders but I was indecisive as to whether I was hungry or not so I just asked for water. Later on as the evening progressed, I started getting hungry and flagged a waiter to ask for an order of fries.\nI waited and waited and waited. I felt as if my group would leave soon and I wouldn't get my food, so I got up and walked towards the doorway of the kitchen. Before I got there, there was a waiter also approaching the entrance of the kitchen planning on going in.\nI asked, \"Is it possible to check on my order of fries?\"\nThe waiter peeked into the kitchen and said, \"Yes, it looks like your fries are on the counter. We'll bring it to you.\" Okay, I just went back to my seat and continued my conversation.\nA few moments later, a man in a vest (who I presume was the manager) came over and said,\" Lady, don't go to the kitchen and ask for your food. We're really busy here,\" he waves to the large group of tables we've put together for my group,\"and we'll bring the food to you when we're ready.\" This in a very angry tone.\nI've never had someone (a restaurant manager) try to chew me out in front of friends in any situation. I value politeness and courtesy. These are values that I grew up with and so, for someone to do this in a setting that is \"supposed\" to be geared toward customer service it is T-O-T-A-L-L-Y unacceptable behavior. I understand the wait staff was stressed. I understand I was in a large party of 20 people - for which we were bringing business to this establishment.\nUnfortunately, because of this experience, I will N-O-T ever return to the Irish Bank Bar. And I will not recommend it to any of my friends or acquaintances. Ever.", "author": "Joanna T."}

Once you look down the other alley there's no mistaking that there's a bar here! \n\nUsually pretty busy every time I go there, but I never had to wait more than a couple minutes to get service. This is mainly because I'm alone and can pony up at the bar. I can't say what it's like for large groups! Sorry that I'm a loser and can't help any future large party seekers trying to find a place to hang. \n\nThey have a pretty strong selection of beers and I'm very impressed with the menu. Not bad pricing on most items. Don't know about wine selection. \n\nThis is the first place that I have been to that takes your credit card to hold on file while ordering food.

We were one drink in and our blonde waitress asked if we wanted another drink. We let her know we had tabs at the bar and she kindly agreed to take our orders for a second round saying if it was only maybe two beer rounds including the one we ordered with her, we were fine.\n\nWe ordered food and were enjoying our drinks, the ambiance of being off work and being able to relax after a 11/12 hour day when a dark haired waitress came to our table to take our order. She let us know our blonde waitress was on break. She asked my coworker for her drink and my coworker let her know we had an open tab. She reluctantly took the order and then asked me if I wanted a drink. I too ordered and then let her know I also had an open tap at the bar. The waitress made a face, said \"oh no. You can order at the bar!\" And walked away abruptly.\n\nThe waitress walked away from my table. She made a face. She also refused us service for no reason. \n\nI went into the bar, calm and collected and reasonably asked for a manager. While I waited for the manager to appear, the dark haired waitress came up to me and said I have your drink (a margarita). I let her know it wasn't my drink (I was drinking an IPA) and she said \"your friend ordered it.\" I let her know I needed to speak to her manager and told her to please go get him. She continues to try and argue with me before I told her to please leave me alone and get her manager. She ran off. \n\nThe manager came up to me and asked what was wrong. He was a tall Irish man and I was told HE WAS THE OWNER. I explain the situation and he said he had issues with the dark hair waitress before. He went off to inquire with his waitress. \n\nAll the while the waitress had gone back and given my coworker the drink she had previously tried offering me inside the bar.  She apparently profusely apologize to my table and gave my coworker the drink telling her she put it on her tab. Only 5 minutes ago she had refused service. \n\nWhile I waited, I figured I would buy another beer. Why not, right? I was merely going to explain the situation to the manager. My drink arrived and the \"owner\" returned. His words were the worst. \"So your friends accepted the drink. What's your problem? Why are you complaining. You're the only one that has a problem.\" \n\nFIRST the dude never went to our table to inquire with my coworkers. He merely spoke to his pathetic excuse for a waitress. \n\nSECOND he basically blamed me for his bull SH!? waitress' HORRIBLE customer service. \n\nI asked for this man's name and he replied with, \"you don't have to know that.\" My response was \"you're the owner and you're not going to stand by your bar? What's your name?\" He repeated himself. So I handed him my beer and told him I would like my money back. He got angry with me and told his bar tenders to void my open tab. I NEVER ASKED HIM TO DO SO. He them asked me to leave. \n\nThis man escalated the situation and blamed me for his horrible employees customer service who was trying to cover her ass. This \"owner\" asked me to leave and said I threw my beer at him which I did not. I merely went in to convey the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. This man was angry. Why? Because I said I didn't want my beer anymore and wanted my card refunded for the beer after he tried giving me cash? WHAT KIND OF OWNER DOESNT GIVE HIS NAME AND DOESNT STAND BY HIS BAR? \n\nOur company will not ever return to this bar and I'll make sure they don't.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-03", "description": "I lived for 6  1/2 years in Europe and so I feel like I have a pretty good idea what a good pub, a traditional Irish or British pub, should look like and feel like.\n\nI recently moved to San Francisco from Arizona and so I'm on the lookout for good pubs here as well.  Since I work in the financial district a couple streets over from two of the well-known pubs in this area, I decided to check them out.  \n\nYou can check out my review on Murphys to see what I thought of it, here we'll just talk about The Irish Bank.  I went twice to each place.\n\nD\u00e9cor-Excellent.  One of the other posters made a tongue in cheek comment about it being \"standard, boilerplate\" d\u00e9cor for a pub trying to look authentic, and that's true, but it isn't a bad thing.  Pubs that go out of their way with the wall paraphernalia and signs and the choice of woods and chairs and tables and so forth get an extra nod from me.  This place TRIES very hard to look like a place in Ireland that has been around for 200 years, and guess what?  They succeed.  The result is a place that is warm and inviting, and a place you'd like to have dinner.\n\nFood-Here I will virtually copy and paste my review from Murphys since it applies here as well.  Good, traditional bar food.  Nothing that would make you frown, and nothing that would make you alert the media and throw a ticker tape parade.  I won't go into details on the food because the review would basically be echoing what I just wrote.  It is good food, not spectacular, but not bad either.\n\nService:  Decent service on the food, but the bartender my first time played hardball with the $10 minimum credit card rule.  I get following rules, especially if you're not the owner.  I also get the fact that MOSTR businesses in the city take either cash only or have a rule like this because of the charges that come with accepting credit cards.  I get all that.  What I don't get is the attitude and look of irritation on the face of the person, seemingly annoyed that I'm even asking about it.  \"How much is a cider, then?\"  I ask.  \"Not $10\" he responds.  Ok, thanks Gomer.  How about we lose the snarky attitude and just answer the question?  \"How much is a cider?\" I repeat.  \"$7\" is the answer.  So, ok, I get it.  There's really not much on the menu for $3, so what ends up happening is it becomes a two drink minimum if you want to use plastic, a $14-$16 adventure.  OR, you can get an $11 or $12 mixed drink, but that's not what you really want to drink anyway.  So it's an inconvenience for customers who only have plastic, OR you can use the ATM on site and pay another $5 between it and your bank just to pull out the money.  So basically--plan ahead and bring cash, or use your card for multiple drinks or people.  This is all well and good.  I guess my point is I really appreciate folks who relax and take into consideration the fact that it's someone's first time (as I indicated it was for me) and make small gestures to communicate \"you're important to us, let me figure out a way to help you out\".  The Murphys bartender \"got\" this concept.  The Irish Bank fellow apparently not.\n\nAnd before you feverishly jump on and start pounding away on your keyboard at me, Mr. Angry Irish Bank Yelp Reviewer Manager Guy, lol, relax.  :)  I didn't take any stars away because I realize this is the rule you guys established and it is also common in the FiDi.  You still got 4 stars.  I just wish the bartender wouldn't have looked at me and spoken to me like I had just asked him for his mother's  checking account information.  That was unnecessary.\n\nLocation:  Really cool that it is down an alley.  Also a cool table/chair set up out front that makes you think Oktoberfest or festival or something.  Very cool..\n\n\nFinal analysis:  The Irish Bank is a good place to go sit down with a group of people and eat or celebrate something.  Good atmosphere, decent food, great environment.    For one or two pints before an event or if you're just going in for a quick drink?  I'd probably stick with Murphys around the corner.\n\nBoth are solid, however.", "author": "John B."}

If they give you a menu with food stains you know there's something wrong.  That's such a huge glaring error that you know their practices are poor.  Never accept a dirty menu and if you can avoid eating at the restaurant you wold be well advised to fill your tummy elsewhere.  Such was the menu I was given, a crusty red stain on the plastic of the ragged old menu screamed to me \"get out!\"  \n\nBut my girlfriend, knowing my rule, was enamored by the cheap ambiance so we remained. \n\nThe Reuben I ordered was absolutely inedible, the corned beef was cut not only  too thick, but also sliced with the grain.  Then it was either steamed or poached. It was rubbery and impossible to bite without the contents of the sandwich pulling out..  Such preparation is absolute culinary incompetence.  I want Gordon Ramsey to yell at them for me. \n\nMy girlfriend got a fish and chips.  The fish was bland,  The fries were fine.  The slaw was little more than damp cabbage.  Nothing was seasoned. \n\nThey were quick and complient when I sent back my Kosher shoeleather.  I just said \"give me what she's having\" just to be done with it.  \n\nBut my fish and chips weren't just mediocre like my girlfriend's.  The dish was greasy, over-browned and had a slightly burned flavor.  \n\nI've been a cook for decades.  I know exactly what it looks and tastes like when you take a cold plate of fries and fish and reheat it in the fryer.  Even tried it for myself to make a quick meal out of an extra plate that never went out.  What I believe is that they had this extra fish and chips lying around, flashed it in the fryer and put it on a plate for me, probably thinking that I would be happy it came out so fast. \n\nI spoke to my sweet and helpful waitress.  At my behest she rushed the plate away so it would no longer offend me with its odious presence upon my table of dining.   I gave up on eating and had a nice cigarette on the way to the car.\n\nSince I started to write this review I've been to the restroom twice.  The churning in my gut is telling me that reheated fish and chips is a lot frelling older than I thought.   How repulsive and dishonest, it's shameful that they were going to try and charge me 12 bucks for the shitty mess they brought to the table. \n\nIt's two hours later and I am still quite unwell.  I'll probably never eat again.  I think it's mostly the sheer amount of oil I consumed.  When you let fried breaded foods get cold they turn into sponges for more oil.  \n\nAvoid this overpriced, disgusting little rat-hole.  Real talk from the pit of my aching gut.", "author": "J P."}

I went the night with my ten year old son to grab a bite-our hotel is around the corner. He was excited to go to an Irish restaurant as there are a number of good Irish pub/restaurants in our hometown. However, we walked in the door and no one spoke to us. We stared at the waiter and waitress who were deep in conversation, glanced at us, and continued to chat. Eventually (after about five minutes) the waiter looked up and told us to seat ourselves. We did so. After another 10 minutes later (while the waiter and waitress continued to chat) , the waiter eventually deigned to bring us some water. When my son asked what was on the nachos, the waiter sighed as if he had never had any question the nachos before-certainly not a 10 year old boy. When the nachos arrived, they were exactly what I might have concocted in my microwave-store-bought chips, some cheddar strewn over them, and nuked. My son got fish and chips which arrived burned and I got irish stew which had an odd, sour taste about it. The food was brought to us by the busboys. I called out to the waiter three times (and I tend to be quite patient with wait staff-it can be a hard job) but there was no other way to get his attention. I called out for drink refills and for the check. Then when we received the check, we realized they had charged us $2.50 a person for tap water.

I ordered a pomegranate margarita and it was mainly filled with ice. It was so watered down it was like drinking from a juice box. Another member of my table ordered a cocktail and it was also super watered down. I tasted it. It was like water with food coloring and little syrup. Then, our food comes out. I ordered a cheeseburger medium cooked. That patty was so over-cooked that it was hard to chew. My jaw was hurting after finishing the burger. It was so burnt that I was able to scrape the bottom of the patty and watch it crumble. That patty was dryer than the California drought. I didn't want to return it because I hate wasting meat, though that meat was already wasted. Finally, the fries were way undercooked. I asked for some new fries, so when the waitress returned my plate with hot fries, she told me those were completely fresh. I could tell they were not fresh, because the one fry I took a bite out of was still on the plate and though some fries were softer, some of the fries were still undercook. Don't even get me started on the steak that another member of the table ordered. That person too asked for a medium cooked steak and it was obviously well done. I will never go back to the Irish Bank. And the worst part was that my family paid over $100 for this garbage!", "author": "Eric M."}

My boyfriend and I came here for a late night drink and decided to get a scotch. They had quite an impressive scotch selection (as well as whiskey and bourbon) and we had trouble narrowing down which one we wanted to have. I settled for a Balvenie 12 Year and my better half went for the Glenfiddich. We both were happy with our selections and slowly sipped on them while we took in the bar around us. It seemed to be mostly tourists, which made sense given it was a Sunday night and there are more than a handful of hotels within walking distance.\n\nIf you're looking for an Irish beer, they had a few on draught, but their American craft selections were pretty terrible, ranging from Shock Top to Lagunitas IPA (I love this beer, don't get me wrong, but it was the ONLY beer I'd drink there). By California being such a brewery laden state, I would have expected a bit more than their 8-10 beer offerings.\n\nLastly, the bartender was pretty indifferent towards us, barely acknowledging us and seemed to be put out by us asking for the scotch list. He didn't ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished, and took forever to get our bill. This was ridiculous considering we were one of three parties at the bar and the restaurant was pretty dead overall.\n\nRegardless, if you're close and looking for a drink or two, The Irish Bank will do the job.", "author": "Megan K."}

I was a younger, more naive girl then but I was still very adventurous.  Unfortunately, I was with a group of friends who were quite dull and only wanted to do the top touristy stuff.  Well, I split off from my party to explore SF in my way.  On my way around town I met these 2 local kids who, after a glass of Chianti and long conversation on Italian Hill, drove me around SF on their cool retro motorcycles.  It was fun times.  Later that night when my friends didn't show up at our motel and the pre-arranged meeting time, I called the boys again and they came and took me to a hidden Irish pub that I never knew the name of, where I enjoyed my first Guinness.  I thought I'd never find it again... \n\nFast forward to last Saturday...  I met a group of friends at a hidden lil Irish pub that Crys B had picked out randomly from Yelp reviews and, you guessed it... it was my mysterious pub from a decade ago!  Yay!!  I can't believe I found it after all these years.  Good times and good memories... \n\nThat being said, the drinks were strong, crowd friendly and there's a room in the back that had plenty of seating with a fireplace.  \n\nMy bacardi/diet was 7$ and my friends Stella was 6$.  Don't know the rest of the pricing but that seemed fair for SF.  \n\nThe place got packed for a while but was still manageable.   The only problem was the bathroom.  It was durrrrty when we arrived at 9:30 and already had only 1 toilet because the other way way out-of-order.  It'd be nice if they had checks through-out the night or at least before the drinking hours begin.  Ok, we'd also have liked a lil music in the backroom. \n\nI liked the outside patio they had when we first arrived too.  It was closed later in the night though so I'm not sure what time they pull the tables in for that.  \n\nWe'll probably be back since this is a fun Irish pub with Smithwick's, Murphy's and such... and good seating options.  \n\nSee ya there!", "author": "Susan D."}

The bartender who answered the phone said he was the only one there and asked me to call back in 3 hours. Yes, it was my bad for leaving my card there in the first place but having worked in a bar, you know to expect people to forget things at a place where alcohol is served. If you're debating which is more important (a) confirming whether or not a customer left their credit card (which all usually get stored in one place and takes about 2 minutes), or (b) making sure that someone else gets their beer 2 minutes faster...I'd choose \"a.\"", "author": "Jennifer P."}

At first I was concerned that there were too many juices for the stew portion, but the potatoes soaked it up nicely and my bowl was cleaned off pretty well.  Again, congratulations, self, for having such a big appetite.  You're officially a fatty.\n\nOne of the pricier lunches for the area, although it's definitely not your typical grab-and-go deals in the Financial District.  Perfectly cozy for a cold day, nice breezy alley to sit outside when it's nice and warm.  Definitely a fan of their selection of food and libations.\n\nAnd for those of you wondering, I still ended up being in a food coma at work.

Good day.\n\nFriendly folks here, with some attitude to make it interesting.

On our walk back to our timeshare from AT&T Park we came across this lively alley known as Mark Ln. Hungry from our long walk back we decided to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Unfortunately, upon arrival, Tom, the former Army soldier now Asian bouncer (well he's always been Asian from what I can tell but now a bouncer. This normally wouldn't matter but tonight it did) told us that the kitchen was closed. Bummer! However, he told us that if he were off he'd go to this place down the street called Sauce. So we took his suggestion and headed that way. We were so pleased with our experience at Sauce that we made a point to stop back by and thank Tom for his awesome suggestion. He was happy to hear we liked it and invited us in for a nightcap. \nWhile I am originally from the Bay Area, my wife is a native of Las Vegas and was totally amazed at how everyone in the bar interacted with one-another and acted as if everyone had known each other for years. She said, \"you'd never see this kind of interaction in Vegas\". I simply replied, \"welcome to San Francisco!\"\nImmediately, the bartender  served our drinks, who seemed to be rather a happy chap who spoke with a charming Irish accent. You knew it wasn't faked either for ambiance. While at the bar we met a young Swede in town for an electronic gaming programmers convention. The conversation with this guy was extremely fascinating. I was shocked to hear how clean he and his coworkers found the streets to be in America. I figured Europeans would laugh at the state of our streets. I guess everything you hear about Europe being better isn't always true. Our conversation with the swede rolled into a conversation with two Irish brothers who were reunited this day after eight years. One brother has lived in SF for the last ten years, and this was the brother from Ireland's first trip to the States. The Irish brother attended his first baseball game. He didn't understand a thing about the sport but declared it was now his favorite. He was mesmerized by the game and atmosphere. We had to explain to him AT&T Park and Giants fans were a rare bread. He was even more shocked that getting to first base, second base, third base, and home originated in baseball. He'd always thought it was solely in reference to how far you got with a girl. Utterly hilarious! Witnessing these two reminiscing along with the bartender about their homeland provided our entertainment for the next two hours (we learned that the one brother living in SF was known at the bar as DJ Pat who spins at the Irish Bank for special occasions). What was even more comical was the fact that they were drinking Corona after Corona because they had spent the entire day drinking Guinness and needed to \"flush their system\". \nSo it's places like the Irish Bank where you can meet an Asian bouncer named Tom who is a U.S. Army veteran, A Swede who found it remarkable how clean our streets were, and Irish men drunk off their butts praising their love for baseball. \"Just another night at The Bank\", we were told. In the words of a famous Austrian weightlifter/ actor turned governor, \"I'll be back!\"", "author": "Tom O."}

It's an annual tradition (3 of the past 4 years) for me to celebrate St. Patrick's Day at the IB! They always decorate so festively with the massive green, orange, and white balloon arch at the alley entrance, and streamers and shamrocks galore. Also, all day entertainment is provided with live music and traditional dancers. \nOf course, the crowd is jovial and energy is awesome, especially if you've had a few cocktails. (For me, it'd be an Irish coffee to start and then the rounds of Guinness, the bombs, etc.,) \n\nLast year, my friend, Amy G and I woke up at the crack of dawn to head over to the Irish Bank to catch part of the Alice 97.3 live morning broadcast of the then 'Sarah and No Name' show. It was a wild and crazy morning of complete drunken chaos, but so much fun. Here is how crowded the alley gets http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/QkZfMbklsq8nHAtRbVfIJA/l \nand here's a pic of No Name with his samurai and ginormous stein of beer http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/IJF40IKQSDQP7buX3nichQ/l \n\nAside from hitting up the IB for St. Patrick's Day, I've also attended many Happy Hours and birthday celebrations (including my own). Of course, the best place to be seated is outside, especially if the weather is lovely. Even if it's a bit nippy outside, well, all you need is one drink (Irish coffee, Guinness) to warm you up! If you choose to sit inbe indoors, I recommend sitting in the confessional with a few of your closest friends. This is the only bar I know of with a confessional. Once you confess your sins, they'll be absolved with a shot of Fernet or Jameson :) \n\nBTW, the IB food is actually quite good and reasonably priced. There's a wide selection of sammies, hamburgers, salads, and other entrees like steak and  corned beef and cabbage. A few of my favorites are the cheddar cheese fries and the mac and cheese (Yes, I'm a cheesy type of gal)! I swear this mac and cheese is one of the best I've ever had! No joke! As for the fries, halfway through this year's Chinese New Year Treasure Hunt http://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-new-year-treasure-hunt-san-francisco#hrid:u67xlsNqasyZLyRPjw9nQg my team and I decided to make a pit stop at the IB for those tasty fries and beer. They were thick and crisp with the perfect amount of cheesy melty goodness on top (as we ordered the cheddar fries and the blue cheese fries). The plates were practically licked clean. \n\nService is decent here, and never had any bad experiences. Can get slow when it's super crowded. Ladies, the bathroom only has two small stalls, and allows for maybe 2 people tops to wait inside if stalls are occupied. Otherwise, you'll be waiting outside the bathroom doors, just across from the Men's room. \n\nOf course, I'll be back at the IB!

So we are in ageement!\"\n\nVery mature response received by the OWNER of the restaurant. This is undoctored email that is a testament to The Irish Bank's inability to accept responsibility for their actions and also their lack of maturity. Instead of trying to make amends and apologize, they resort to ad hominem attacks - because they know they're wrong. \n\nYelpers, please keep this in mind when you decide which establishment to give your money to!\n\n~~~~\n\nWe organized a large reddit meetup here, and our experience was not pleasant. \n\nManagement nagged us continually through the night, complaining about our under-21 guests, even though we had cleared it with them beforehand.\n\nThey also complained that we were taking up too many tables - all of us were buying drinks and food; this is the first time I've heard management complain about CUSTOMERS.\n\nSpeaking of buying drinks and food, waitresses did not come around nearly as much for a large group. There would be half-hour intervals when no one would come by to service us. When they did service us, they were not very friendly.\n\nThere was also a portly waiter who kept on giving my 2 friends and I the stink eye. We were standing up, but not in his way at all. Instead of saying anything, he just remained passive-aggressive the whole night. \n\nPerhaps the worst part about our group experience at The Irish Bank was their Enron-style accounting. We had no idea what was happening with the tab - and neither did they. In the end, after many of us folks left (and paid!), the final tab arrived, and it  appeared that we owed around $130 more than we thought we owed! To be honest, we have no idea what happened, a $130 excess is crazy. I'm not saying anything about The Irish Bank's honesty, but I will say that they offered us poor explanation for it and did not cooperate as well as we thought they would.\n\nOn the flipside, the Bank Martini was tasty, and the Reuben sandwich was all right, but nothing \"Famous\" like the menu suggests.\n\nThis place does have a 4 star average review, so it might be a totally different experience if you're coming here with one or two friends, but I can only speak about my experience.

As to quote the owner \"You cannot just turn up at a restaurant and expect everything to be fine\".\n\nLong story: Keep in mind this was a group of polite internet nerds (reddit)....  I contacted the Stephanie Perry, the owner I think, about renting out the function room. After a few emails back and fourth we agreed not to rent out the function room because it was a casual meetup and I couldn't guarantee we would hit the $1000 minimum. She said we could still use the room  but it would  not be private. However it was very clear that we expected closer to 40-50 people. We agreed to come in and grab tables as needed.\nI have organized a lot of meetups and have had nothing but good experiences in the past. The Thirsty Bear and  Rouge are two awesome places for groups.\n\nThe day of the event we got there and no one knew we were coming. Instead of welcoming us and apologizing the bar manager was obviously irritated.\n\nThroughout the night the bar manager  complained we were taking up too much and when we had about 30 people, also known as paying customers, he told me not to take up any more tables. Those tables sat empty the rest of the night. There were quite a few other issues which have already been highlighted in other reviews so I will jump right to the emails Stephanie sent me.\n\nTwo days later I get an email from Stephanie asking me how it went. I ignored it.\n\nTwo people from our group posted their opinions on Yelp. This morning I got this email from Stephanie: My points are starred*\n\nI am deeply offended by the allegations made on Yelp by name removed  and name removed - giving us one star each.\n\nYou did NOT have a reservation. You cannot just turn up at a restaurant and expect everything to be fine - you expected anywhere from 15 to 50 people - how can we, as a functioning restaurant, plan with a spread like that - that was the reason you didn't make the reservation - you couldn't guarantee your numbers.  You said \"we will just grab seats as they come up.\" You prevented us from putting our best foot forward.\n\n*She knew we were coming, she knew the group would be large and yes, you should be able to walk into a restaurant and expect good service.\n\nIf you had made a reservation the dining room would have been cleared.  If you had made a reservation, there would have been ample staff on to accomodate you.  If you had made a reservation, my staff would have been ready for you and therefore the \"Enron style\" accounting would have been clear.\n\n*Once again, she is confusing what reservation and paying for the private room. We informed her of a large group. We declined her offer of a private room.\n\nIt took 1.5 hours for you guys to figure out the bill, costing me staff overtime. Obviously it was not clear to everyone that there was no tab and that they actually had to pony up.\n*This doesn't even make sense. We were out around midnight. We never planned to skip out on a bill.\n\nIf you order 9 carbombs - that's $90 - I personally went through every drink check and food docket - not one person was overcharged.\n*She wasn't there and already admitted to Enron style accounting.\n\nWe are a hard working threesome.  We strive to make everyone's experience a good one - I feel we were victimized when you showed up without a reservation, and again when two of your people yelped us.  We take this very personally.\n*Victimized by paying customers?!?\n\nI would really appreciate your talking to name removed  and name removed and letting them know the status quo.  This just isn't fair.\n\nI replied back with:\nNo one said we had a reservation, ever. The emails I sent you to inform you of a large group are below.\n\nI organized a meetup for a website, I have forwarded your email but I can not control the opinions of others. Your wait staff was awful, rude and disorganized. This is one of many meetups we have had and we were very unhappy for the first time ever.\n\nI don't even use yelp and didn't know what it was until you messaged me. However I did sign up and I will post your email to me as a review of the irish bank; I think it speaks for itself.\n\nShe asked me to include her reply:\nPerfect!

We could tell they were busy, and we were in no rush, so we didn't mind the 10 minute wait. After the waitress took our drink orders the service was very prompt. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because the drinks (Pint of Guiness and Pint of Pear cider) tasted a little watered down. for 3 bucks a pint, I probably wouldn't mind, but for 5-6 bucks, I expect it to taste like it just came outta the bottle, not watered down. \n\nI ordered the Shepherd's Pie and he ordered the hamburger(typical guy food).

I took a friend here, and it was really crowded and loud inside, so we went to go sit outside, but after just a few minutes, they started tearing down all the tables and chairs and putting them away, and told us we needed to go back inside. Bummer. Even though the pub is open until 2:00am, they close down the outdoor seating around 11pm.\n\nIt eventually calmed down inside, so we were able to hang out for a few hours at a little table, having a nice conversation and drinking Cranberry Tonics. As you approach this place, fight the urge to turn around and run for your life. You have to walk down a side alley to get here, and all your instincts will tell you that you're in a dangerous place, but don't worry. It's a lot of fun.", "author": "Ron S."}

Yah, it's cool that it is located in an alley, but their drinks were only ok.  They have a $10 minimum charge when using credit cards and they don't split the bill if there is a group of people.

While I was working in San Francisco (from 2000-2006) I went there to eat no less than once a week. So I very familiar with the place as well as the people who work there. I am also aware that since I have been going there, there has been an ownership change. I can say before my last visit I would give this place 4-5 stars easy.\n\nSo I am back in the States for a while and went to watch the England/USA World Cup match at AT&T Park on Saturday (12/6/10). After the match we decided to head over to the Irish Bank for a quick lunch. (We were a few home sick Brits looking for a place that we know in the past has always helped squash some of the homesickness.) \n\n(I had not been there since 2009 but its always been a known entity so I was expecting a great experience.). The first thing I noticed was that the wait staff just flat out ignored us, so we sat ourselves down. (Before the wait staff had always been super friendly and VERY welcoming).  We got ourselves a menu and a waitress came up and asked us for our drinks order. \n\nThe next thing I noticed was that the menu had been greatly expanded which seemed great to me at the time. There were more vegetarian options and more hip selections than there had been in the past. The Irish Bank for many years has been known for its fish and chips, It even won a award once as \"best in SF\" and I had ordered then many times in the past, so I ordered them this time.  \n\nAt this point I was still a little disappointed in the way the staff treated us but after half a pint of so I was feeling better. My friend and I were sitting there deep in conversation and I think sometime during that someone from the kitchen brought out my fish and chips. We were so busy talking we didn't notice him. He must have been annoyed because he basically shoved the plate in my face and said \"here!\" and marched off. (He was rather unkempt and had a really unprofessional bushy beard as well.)\n\nI was really annoyed at his behaviour but I again let it go. But then I looked at my plate. The fish and chips were totally different than what I had had before. The fish used to be in a very nice, flaked batter, very similar to what you get in Great Britain. The fish in front of me was in some type of hard, dark brown cocoon that looked more like something you would get from the store. The actual fish was tough and rubbery and had a batter to fish ration of like four to one. It was really horrible. I was so disappointed. And the chips? They were so dark from being cooked in dirty grease they were as brown as leather! And so gross! \n\nAlso, I should add almost the whole time we were there our waitress disappeared for most of our experience.   \n\nI just am still gob-smacked. What the hell happened to this place? It used to be my favourite place to eat at in all of the Bay Area. I can tell you this woman will NOT being going back. \n\nIt's not just how bad everything was, it's has far it's fallen. So sad...\n\n\n\n\n.", "author": "Gaelic F."}

(Thank you, inebriated Karen.)  \n\nIrish Bank was having a St. Patty's Day celebration after the parade so the lane was closed off and a stage was set up for live music.  Waitresses were carrying various beers around to hydrate the party-goers and everyone was in a pretty jovial mood.  The outside party section was pretty clean and so was the inside of the bar.  Actually, the inside of the bar was pretty romantic.  It had that classic Irish bar setting with the dark wood, gold metal bars, and photos of Irish people.

Great selection of pub style beers, including of course guinness, harpers, boddingtons, murphys, etc. The place knows how to pour a legit pint of guinness, which according to the masters requires the \"double pour technique\", clocked in at 119.53 seconds. It makes a difference - I've had a straight pour and its a glass of foam. The bar snacks I've tried are good and I like how you can order from the bar at night - helps keep an even keel whilst imbibing your third pint.\n\nThe ambiance is typical Irish pub, but done well. There is a church confessional tucked in between the two rooms - I NEED to get that spot someday! Needless to say you must be quick because people jump on it faster than an open spot at the bar. \n\nI love the Irish bank on weekdays, or weekends during the day. Weekends at night this place can get super crowded and the bar can't handle crowds very well. Due to the prime real estate on which the Irish bank sits (off Union square) prices per pint are around $6, so not the cheapest. \n\nThe breakdown: 4.5 stars for atmosphere\n                           4 stars for drink and food\n                           2 stars for price and crowd", "author": "Jon L."}

Plus their bathroom has a good feel to it (yes, I know it's odd to say that, but it's very true!) \n\nTheir fries come with a delicious curry dipping sauce and their mac 'n cheese is a creamy delicious puddle topped with bread crumbs in just the right proportion that surprisingly was pulled off very well.

So many resources existed to give me options, but they were very poor about narrowing them down. I do not want every place that happens to have a television, I want a good soccer pub where I can enjoy a hearty beer and the company of many like minded fans. But no, I kept being overwhelmed with options.\n\nI ended wandering the streets and asking the first person I bumped into wearing a soccer jersey where he was going. He pointed me to the jumbotron at the commons, which was pretty cool (even if I had to brown bag my beverage).\n\nHowever, later in my wanderings I learned I made a mistake.\n\nOdd options would come up in my search. For example, the German Cultural Institute. I understand they might show Germany games, but I don't think they would have a bar, so they were no good. Across from them was a place called \"Irish Bank\" which I assumed was actually a bank, and likewise ignored it. \n\nThat was my mistake. The Irish Bank is in fact a wonderful Irish pub, and had a good crowd for the Third Place Game. Wait service was a little slow, but overall I really dug the place and wish I could have spent more time there.\n\nSIDE NOTE: I understand you have the habit of throwing a Bastile Party (which is already a little odd for an Irish pub), but given what France did to Ireland this year, I'm surprised they didn't cancel it.", "author": "Ralph M."}

The Irish Stew tasted suspiciously similar to canned Dinty Moore Beef Stew with instant mashed potatoes thrown on top. And the \"bangers and mash\" was pretty much Van De Camps beans, more instant potatoes and a pretty horrible brat that my husband didn't even finish. Top it off with the \"mystery drink ingredients\" (energy drink and vodka...waitress had no clue which energy drink or what vodka???) and it was a very disappointing $65 dollar dinner.

I wanted to try them all even though I do not eat meat.  The Fish n Chips looked really appetizing.  \n\nThe downside to sitting on the patio is that it is hard to get service.  It's perfect for large groups and parties. For a more intimate experience, sitting at the bar or inside is probably best.  All in all, I recommend this place.  Kind of hard to find but worth it.  Hopefully I will be able to make it there for St. Patty's Day and have a Guinness!!", "author": "chibi c."}

The bartenders are friendly, the mixed drinks are strong, and they have a nice selection of beers on tap. We order some cheesy chips and chicken wings (not hot wings sadly, just normal chicken wings) but the savory food more than takes us through the evenings. A pint of Magners, a pint of Smithwicks, a pint of Leffe.... we alternate what we drink throughout the evening and occasionally will order another around of car bombs.\n\nTheir food is a bit pricey, but it's solid and goes well with my Smithwicks or Boddingtons. We can drink at a relaxed pace and get away from the madness of work by walking only 2 blocks.\n\nTheir bathrooms are quite small, but I won't begrudge them that.

Just remember that it's a pub, so get pub food and drink--they do both exceptionally well.  Great place to go to hang out with friends after work.

I heartily recommend the shepherd's pie.\n\nThe St. Patty's day party is off the hook.  Get there early or late if you want to avoid being crushed by a mob trying to get to the bar.  Literally, 5 people deep all around at 7 pm.  The party is also frequented by real Irish people (complete with thick accents), who say it greatly resembles Ireland, except everyone is slightly more sober.  However, the base is so loud that it's hard to have any sort of conversation outside in the alley, and American pop princesses are favored over Irish music of any sort, though apparently this is true of parties in Ireland as well.", "author": "Sydney H."}

The moment I sat down, our service was nothing more than terrible. I flagged down a waitress after being ignored for a while and our interaction goes as follow:\n\nMe: Hi, excuse me; can we order some food through you?\nWaitress: Yes, but I can't do split checks.\nMe: Ok. But can we split it two ways...\nWaitress: NO. That was the first thing I said. I can't split the bill.\nMe: Oh Sorry, I meant on two credit cards.\nWaitress: Yes. But I can't do it on more than two cards. And there must be a minium of  $10 dollars per card.\nMe: Ok. That's fine. I'll have the wings and my friends here wants some fries.\nWaitress: You do realize that's only 15 dollars right? You must order at least $20 dollars.\nMe: Ok, give me another beer.\n\nSo she storms off and disappears. My friends later meets up with us and sits down at a different table and tries to order some more food. Again, they were met with a similar situation from the same waitress with the condescending and bitchy tone. We weren't even sitting at the same table but she forced us to lump our bills together for some reason or another. She then proceeds to to get into an argument with my friend for even having the audacity for asking to split the bill again (even though she was unaware of the situation) and was firm in making sure we were all grouped together under one bill. I understand that whole multiple transaction thing can get annoying but it is never ok to speak to your customers with a short tone and make it seem like they're burdening you with the worse job in the world. It wasn't until we got our bill that I realize the waitress just wanted to tack on the mandatory gratuity to our bill since we were a big group. Good move waitress, I know you depend on tips for your salary but tips should be earned and not something you try to force onto your customers. You work in the service industry, please learn some manners and how to treat your customers with respect.\n\nI know I should have escalated this to a manager that night instead of passive aggressively writing this review on yelp but oh well, what's done is done.

Went there on March 31 after an event per suggestion from a friend.  Got there and was initially quite impressed.  Good location, neat decor, great patio outside, had great potential.  That was the highlight of the evening.\n\nSat down with my group and ordered a round of Guiness.  Half the group had already arrived a bit earlier, and were finishing their meal.  Paid for the first round, and stepped outside to use the patio.  Had been out there all of 15 minutes, and ordered our 2nd round.  Upon delivering the 2nd round, the waiter informs us that the patio is closing at 11pm.  It was 10:55.  So he tells us we have to down our just delivered Guiness.  Um, no, you don't pound a Guiness...\n\nWe asked if the bar was closing, and they said no, the bar is not closing until 2:00am, they just don't want to have to deal with the patio.  On a Saturday night?  Seriously?  Sure enough, 5 minutes later, they are pulling the tables and chairs out from underneath us, and then taking away half unfinished beers from part of the group that couldn't finish a pint of Guiness in 3-5 minutes.  The best part was when one of the group went to get a drink of water from his glass, and the waiter even took that away mid-drink, saying they didn't even want the appearance of alcohol outside.\n\nOK, fine, goodbye then.

They actually starved to death while waiting for their dinner at The Irish Bank.\n\nIf you've had a few drinks, you might believe that history. If you've managed to have a few drinks at the Irish Bank, please tell me your secret! Our waitress was as elusive as a leprechaun. Everything took painfully long to arrive. And it wasn't one of those deals where they were intentionally slowing the food service so you'd order more drinks. Or if they were, they were failing to cash in on the set-up. We'd have gone for it. The flesh was willing but the spirits were unavailable.\n\nI came for the BLT I read about on Yelp. The quality of the ingredients was good. But, while I thought that I'd like having the mayo automatically on the side, the end result was a dry sandwich. Applying mayonnaise at the table wasn't the same because it didn't give the ingredients a chance to mesh.\n\nBoyfriend had the turkey melt. He also felt that while the individual components were good, the end result was only so-so. He suffered serious diner's remorse when he saw the great looking fish and chips ordered by the next table. I initially promised him we'd return to have it, but by the end of the meal we both knew that was unlikely to happen.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was the dessert- the caramel apple torte. The cake-like shell that held the apples and caramel sauce had fridge funk. You know how you can smell it in your mouth just as you take a bite of something? It's disgusting. But while I pretend to be discriminating, I'm actually indiscriminate and I ate almost the whole thing.\n\nShout out to the busboys! Busboys always show me love, God bless them.

But it was still good. \n\nThe Bangers\n- it comes with Heinz baked beans and your choice of a scoop of mashed potatoes or fries. I picked mashed potatoes. YUMMY! I asked the waitress to put it under the broiler to crisp the mashed potatoes a bit. It was delish. The bangers? The best part of the dish.

When I sat down with said friends, I started to feel like I was in a nut house.  First, a stumble-drunk, middle-aged Mexican dude saunters over to our table and immediately starts on a nearly incomprehensible tirade about types of beer commonly consumed on the premises by different nationalities.  No one of my party speaks a lick of... anything but English as far as I know, certainly no Spanish to speak of, so I'm left to translate his Spunglish into coherent words and phrases as best I can and respond accordingly.  He brings over menus and continues, only because my friends are finding him more entertaining than awkward.  When the balance shifts in the favor of \"ok drunkie, take a hike,\" I politely shoo him away.  He returns to his post, the edge of the bar by a cash register, where I'd seen him out of the corner of my eye on the way in.  He squats a little, tips a standing beer on the chest-high counter beside him toward his mouth, and suckles away without the bottom of the bottle leaving the counter's surface.\n\nAt this point, about 5 minutes since we entered the building, this is the only attention our table has received.  It would have probably been a more enjoyable drinking/dining experience had it remained that way.  Unfortunately for us, an unabashedly impatient, ponytailed shrew bellies up to the booth next, soon showing **discernible aggravation** at our having decided to order beverages and food together, rather than running off a list of one first, then the other.  Each subsequent visit from her to our table is like an angry nun in a reading room, rearing a whipping stick as she passes the \"misbehavers\" whose voices are raised too high for her liking.  Everyone clams up and hopes she doesn't bite one of us, then shoulders decompress as she walks away.\n\nLooks of disbelief, confusion and hilarity are exchanged among us following each character's departure from the table.  The $6 pints are tasting more and more expensive.\n\nIt suddenly occurs to me that there is a distinct possibly that the first of the two extreme threats to this business' return customer factor **works** for the establishment, but is apparently only gracing our table with his presence, and only when the spirit moves him to wobble our way for another soliloquy in his own private language.  I personally leave my table to inform one of the uniformed, undrunk waitstaff that his double-dipso coworker by the bar should probably call a cab.  Moments later, after assuring me he'd \"take care of it,\" he's engaged in jovial, half-spanish/half drunk-ass Spanish conversation with him, which lasts for the duration of our meal.\n\nThe Irish Bank broke nearly every rule in my hospitality industry book, on top of serving utter shit for food (fresh from the freezer Ore-Ida fries and Dinty Moore Stew covered in just-add-water mashed potatoes in a re-purposed cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dish masquerading as a \"Shepherd's Pie\") and charged us $50 to do it.

Several pints later, the Sharks came out victorious 5 to 2.

My last name, despite what most would assume since it starts with a \"Mc,\" is Scottish.  EVERYONE in Woodlawn asked me why I had an Irish first name and a Scottish last name.\n\n\"You LOOK Scottish,\" they'd say suspiciously.\n\n\"I'm half Irish & half Scottish - on BOTH sides,\" I'd tell them.  \"I'm from the West Coast.\"  For some reason, being from the West Coast explained EVERYTHING.\n\nIn Woodlawn, you could shop the main street and never know that you were in the U.S.:\n- The grocery store was fully stocked with Irish and some English products\n- The shopkeepers' Irish accents were often almost too thick for my ears to splice through to recognize the English\n- The sidewalks were filled with people who looked like doppelgangers of my uncles in Maine, my great aunts in Boston, and the distant relations who sent my family a Christmas card from Galway every year\n- The most popular place to eat was The Snug which served dishes like shepherd's pie and beef stew, and for breakfast, fried eggs with Irish bacon. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.  You could spend all day there, if you were so inclined.\n\nThe Irish Bank is quite possibly The Snug's twin sister who took a train out West and is now living the high life in San Francisco's Financial District.  While she's hobnobbing with lawyers and bankers and management consultants, deep down, she's still just an Irish gal from the Bronx.\n\nThe dark wood and worn wooden furniture is the same (albeit a bit cleaner).  The creaky wood floors make the same sound.  The moderately friendly (but not disingenuously or effusively so) bartenders pour a good pint.  The waitstaff is attentive and occasionally chatty, but more often than not, straight business.  It can sometimes take what seems like FOREVER to get your food.  The condiment bottles are a teeny bit greasy/grimy but not gross - just used FREQUENTLY. The prices are reasonable and the portions are hearty.  The shepherd's pie is perhaps IDENTICAL in look, flavor and smell.  I think they even use the EXACT same dish to serve it in.\n\nI'm sure Woodlawn has changed since the days when I'd study at a little table in The Snug, sipping a pint and eating shepherd's pie while the waitress asked me about how my classes were going.  Not only, as the saying goes, can you not go home again, but you also can't go back to your favorite haunts and not expect them to have evolved.

I know this because this is what I encounter at MOST of the Irish pubs I enter.

This should be encouraging since my experience in German beer gardens is, also, centered around heavy drinking and raucous behavior. Nope, not here.\n\nHere you can only heavily drink if you can afford to because a Guinness will run you $6 (there are no happy hour specials), and the raucous behavior consists of, wait for it......... standing on the sidewalk that lines the backside of the tables. They have a team out back who will yell at you should you stand on the sidewalk, so don't get too wild and crazy!! \n\nThe food is pretty bland and on the pricey side for pub grub. I guess they have to recoup the cost of hiring all of the gatekeepers out back, though I think they ought to reallocate some of the funds to a few more servers because finding one to order food or a drink is near impossible. \n\nIn short, this is your typical FiDi watering hole.

Panicked, I decided to ignore this fact and just stop drinking Guinness. LEAVE ME ALONE! It's hard enough being me! So I have to drink whiskey here instead (because it's an Irish bar -- DUH!), which is expensive. Argh.\n\n3. The great appeal of the Irish Bank's ambiance is sitting outside in the alley. Which is not a good idea for me times TWO because, 3a.) I've been struggling with quitting smoking for months now and, 3b.) it's downtown in the middle of lots of tall buildings and I have a death-by-earthquake/being-buried-alive fixation (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-smiths-san-francisco#hrid:g2nra86tXx-7riu5idsYng).\n\nSomething continuously brings me back to the Irish Bank, however.

As of today, not anymore.  Our waitress was evasive about answering the question 'what brand of cola do you have' and insisted it was 'just cola'.  OK, no big deal, maybe it's RC or some generic brand they're ashamed to admit to - or perhaps she's too new to know.  Whatever, we brushed that off and ordered our food anyway.  The problem came when we were finished and waited far far too long for our ticket.  I tried to get the waitress' attention a few times, but she just bounced around taking more and more orders and dashing back into the bar.  When I finally got her attention and asked for the ticket, she copped an attitude.  She said 'we're really busy and there's a billion of YOU GUYS and only a few of US'  Um, wow, that was a crappy way for her to handle it.  She had another woman bring our ticket, a lady in a purple dress.  I'm not sure if this lady is the hostess, manager, owner, etc, but she acts like she's queen of sheeba, so I figured she must be one of the higher ups.  When I noticed we'd been overcharged, I told the queen-of-sheeba gal about it and she got flustered.  Then, a nice man in a black apron intercepted and said he'd take care of it.  I asked him if the bill could be processed quickly because we'd already waited a long time just to get the bill.  He responded positively and apologetically (which, by the way management, this is the  appropriate way to respond when a customer is dissatisfied at the slow service your staff has provided).  He was good, but ms. queen-of-sheeba had to jump into it with a snotty tone and declare 'We're really busy!!' I told her 'I get that but at least' ....nevermind what I was saying because she walked off in a mighty huff.  She brushed by me a few moments later with an angry glare.

It was a regular stop when I lived in SF, and I make a pilgrimmage whenever life takes me back to Northern CA. I actually like this Irish bar every bit as much as I like many of my fave Irish bars in Ireland. Without exception, something good happens every time I visit.\n\nThings that make the Irish Bank cool IMO:\n1. Barman Dave: quick, witty, adorable, from West Cork\n2. The Confessional: if , like me, you were raised Catholic, drinking Magner's (aka Bulmer's) in a confessional feels a little naughty. Drinking Bulmer's in a confessional and making out with your date feels a lot naughty.\n3. Clientele: Collars both white and blue, drinking together in perfect harmony. Consistently good looking and overwhelmingly straight. Note that I heart my gay men. But sometimes a girl likes the attention of straight boys, too.\n4. A-OK on the jukebox.\n5. Perfectly pulled pints. (See #1.)\n6. Burgers.\n7. Based upon past experience, friendly members of the SFFD will take you back to your hotel in a fire engine if you don't feel like grabbing a cab.  OK, maybe not you. Maybe just a couple of my friends and me. But then, how you get home isn't my problem.\n\nSlainte'.", "author": "Tracey P."}

The alley of the Bank is accompanied by heaters and they do serve Jameson neat if the heater isn't doing it for you.\n\nInside, you can get the traditional Bangers and Mash, Sheppard's Pie, Fish N' Chips, etc. and sit at these really old tables (that were at one time a long, long time ago Singer sowing machines).  The place feels like a traditional Irish pub with its random barrels sitting around and black and white pictures on the wall of people that are probably actually named Shamis.  Hard wood floors (inside - not in the alley!  duh) lots of space for a Thursday or Friday happy hour, garlic fries to eat before going over to that person that you think is too cute to NOT know you (kidding - eat some gum dummy.  show some moxy, but have some class for goodness sake).\n\nYes, Irish Bank is a lovely spot.  I work for an international company, and every time we have our visitors from the UK over they always want to go to the Bank - guess it makes them feel a bit more at home.

They're located just far away from Union Square and hidden down an alley, so they don't get quite as slammed with tourists as Johnny Foley's. They get points for a couple quality local craft brews (e.g. Lagunita's IPA) alongside the faux Irish pub mainstays (e.g. Guinness, Boddingtons, Smithwicks, etc). The menu is serviceable with a few standout items, like my favorite the blue cheese chips, giant pub fries covered in gobs of stinky blue cheese. The requisite fish and chips aren't that bad either. The large number of big tables outside in the alley makes it more likely that you can grab a seat somewhere, or find seating for a large group. Wear something warm though, the wind howls down the alley and the heat lamps only do so much.\n\nWhere do they do fail? For starters there is a FiDi/UnionSq jack-up of prices, to about around $5.00 a pint. Then there's the hit-or-miss service. It's beyond comprehension that in a pub, you would have to sit at your table twiddling your thumbs with an empty glass, while you wait for your server to take his/her sweet time to come back and ask if you need a refill. This has happened to me 2 out of the last 3 times I've been here.

I owed her shepard's pie for a belated birthday dinner and although it was pretty decent I remembered why it was so good the first time I had it - It was about two years ago - I was drunk - it was my birthday and some random guy bought me (and her) shepard's pie to try to get my number - he didn't! This time around I had regular ass chicken strips and that's all it was - so not worth $8! Needless to say, I don't think I may come back again for a while.\n\nSo why 3 stars? Our bartender gal was very friendly and attentive to us, the guiness was properly poured, it was easy for us to get a seat right at the bar and Sal Castaneda from mornings on 2 sat next to me - but he didn't buy me a drink!

I came here on New Year's Eve with some friends, since a few of us (well, me, mostly) wanted a more low-key evening than one would find in a club full of beautiful people. And for the first hour, we had exactly the kind of fun, relaxed celebration we wanted. Somewhere along the way though, the bar became super crowded, and after too many drinks I became That Girl.... To everyone there that night, well, I'm sorry. And that's all I'll say about that!\n\nStill, everything that happened before the midnight champagne toast was pretty cool. Awesome, laid-back crowd, especially in the back room, where we all sang along to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" just before midnight. Nice, tucked away location off the street. Friendly, if harried bartenders; service was understandably slow but the nice Irish boy I met that night had no problems getting us served quickly.

It was much better after sprinkling on some of the plethera of blue cheese that made our fries so rich.\n\nI also ordered lentil soup, although I don't know why since the beer, fries and mac'n'cheese (even sharing them!) were enough to fill my belly, so I got a to-go container right away and ate the soup the next day, also crumbling in some blue cheese from the leftover \"crack\" fries.

Honestly, I liked that there was a lot of bacon and that we got to sit outside in the alley.  Friends got a plain cheeseburger and chicken strips.  Greasy food?

The alleyway patio seating was charming and fun and our sever was very patient and nice to us. (A younger girl so she joined in on a lot of our laughing and joking). We all ordered a variety of different items from the menu so I was able to try and see a lot of the dishes. I ordered the BLT and it was horrible - only a few over cooked painfully crunchy pieces of bacon on some stale barely toasted dry bread. However I ended up eating from a few friends' plates and the calamari was good, blue cheese fries, chicken strips, fish and chips, all alright and I heard the kielbasa and sour kraut was delicious. The server did forget one of the club sandwiches we ordered but made up for it with two free beers. Boyfriend ordered the Cesar salad and it was pretty small, chicken was a little overcooked but he probably didn't make the wisest choice ordering a salad at a place like that.

That's what I said to Capital R and (newly elite) Jason K this evening when we happened into The Irish Bank on our quest for meat and beer. \n\nWe got there around 6 and were able to grab a table in the cute back room. Matt and I had fabulous big burgers, cooked good and rare, just like I like my dead animals on buns ($9). The green salad ($2 additional w/burger) was a lovely organic spring mix, lightly dressed to perfection. Matt and (newly elite) Jason's fries were so good I ate all of them and then, in the middle of my screaming foodgasm, spilled a whole bottle of ketchup all over myself. Yes, it was that good! I suggest a full-body napkin if you intend to get as excited about the food as I did. Because if you do get that excited, and you do spill ketchup all over yourself, from your knees to your neck, you will be shit out of luck when you get to the restroom and find out they don't have paper towels and you are forced to clean your expensive clothes off with toilet paper, which leaves white paper pills all over your black cashmere sweater and gray suit pants. \n\nLots of beer but only a handful of wines mean you should probably come with a hankering for ale or a flexible attitude in terms of the wine menu. For three of us, the bill was about $60 with tip. That was for two burgers, a turkey club (which I also ate a lot of- thank you, newly elite Jason K), a glass of wine, and two beers. Not ridiculously cheap but a hot deal in the fidi. I'll be back. In fact, I may go back later tonight for another burger. It was really that good.", "author": "Autumn K."}

It took so long for the first round to arrive that we intentionally ordered our second round before the first glass hit the table.

Five minutes later he was literally snapping his fingers and strutting back and forth along the alley and then he stopped to chat with some of his ugly friends.

And if you like them dirty, then this is definitely the place for you. They make them so dirty (me being the person who usually asks for extra olive juice on the side) sometimes you have to ask them to tone them a bit. But just a bit.\n\nAs far as whiskies go. Great selection of single malts. Only problem: last time I was there I asked for a Glenmorangie with 3 rocks. What I got was the equivalent of a half shot. WTF?! It's an $8 drink, I expect to get a decent sized shot. I should have asked for a bit more, but I thought, meh. It was still early and I new I was going out later anyway.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? The service kind of sucks. Sorry. I hate to say it and I really would love to give them 5 stars, but so many times I've found myself waiting on one side of the bar while the bartender is just hanging out at the other end and I have to walk my ass over there to get his fucking attention. Come on. Wake up damn it. And about those martinis, I once waited about 10 min for the bartender to make me one. I said \"dirty kettle, please\" and he says, \"ok\" and then he disappeared.  If he had to go down to the cellar or whatever cuz they were out of olives or something, then at least let me know. I don't want to have to stand there like an idiot wondering where the bartender went. If it wasn't for the size of the glass, I might have never bothered again.\nBut the waiter is the worst. That's why I try to avoid sitting in the restaurant. He's just so rude. I mean, I can understand you're having an off day or whatever, but it's every fucking time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-18", "description": "Some Irish pubs outside of Ireland have names like O'Leary's or O'Conner's as part of their half-hearted attempts to create an Irish ambiance. The Irish Bank gets to the point. This place looks so authentically Irish that you'll start wondering where all the leprechauns are hiding or if the guy next to you is an IRA separatist bomber related to Gerry Adams.\n\nIf you sit inside you'll be more likely to believe you're in Ireland thanks to the pub-like wood paneling. The outside seating, though popular, has more of a something-bad-will-happen-in-this-dark-alley theme. Yes, the Irish Bank is in a seedy alley.\n\nI liked the food. Irish food is a bit like British food, but it's actually cooked well. Get the Irish stew. They've also got a bunch of good \"Irish\" beers. The servers will talk at length about the nuanced differences between the ales, lagers and ciders if you prompt them.\n\nI'm not sure why this pub's a bank though.

I forgot about you.\"\n-  After moving inside due to rain, I tried to get another beer from the waiter who refused to serve me until I closed my tab with the bartender.\n\nSecond visit:\n\n-  I ordered the \"Chicken Wings\" expecting Buffalo Wings, but got breaded fried wings with no sauce on them.  You might say this is my fault for expecting Buffalo Wings.  However, the wings came with ranch dressing (which you would not expect with regular chicken wings), and when I asked if they had blue cheese, the waitress said no, and it never occurred to her that I might be expecting Buffalo wings (or she just didn't care).  Not only did they come with ranch, but they also came with a BBQ sauce that tasted like the BBQ sauce at McDonald's when you order McNuggets.\n-  There were about 8-10 wings on the plate, which cost $8 (almost a buck/wing, which is absurb when they don't even come with a half decent sauce.\n-  Seeing as how I couldn't eat the wings, due to them being disgusting, the waitress asked me if I wanted to box them up (they were UNTOUCHED).  When I said no, she just carried them off and threw them away, never asking me if there was something wrong.  In fact, I watched the cook ask her why the wings were untouched, and she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.\n\nMy ratings for Irish Bank-\nFood: Gross\nService: Horrendous\nPrices: Decent except for the wings\nBeer Selection: Half decent\nAtmosphere: Deceivingly nice", "author": "Alexander J."}

Here's why:\n\nWe've gone to the Irish Bank periodically after work from Friday drinks for years.  It's always been OK, but nothing spectacular.\n\nWe went there last night- Friday after work with a group of about 6 of us.  They have tables out front in the street, but they were all taken.  We got drinks, and were standing up outside.  One of the staff- a manager?- came over and told us we had to sit down.  No niceties, she just came over and started in.  I pointed out the complete lack of open seats and asked her to bring some to us if she demanded we sit down.  She then told me I was rude and said that if they lost their street use permit it would all be my fault.  She walked away and we managed to scrounge two chairs.  Then a male member of the staff came over and told a couple of use we couldn't sit on the curb of the sidewalk, it was a \"fire lane\".  So they stood back up.  Then the lady came back and told us we couldn't stand up there, but could move down to the end of the alley and around the corner.  We unhappily complied, and took the two chairs with us.  So guess what?  If you go around the corner, the other alley there is full of dumpsters.  This was lovely on the hot September afternoon.  Nothing like the smell of rotting trash to make after work drinks an enjoyable experience.  Putrid rot, anyone?  Oh, and that's also where the gaggle of smokers was, so trash and smoke- lovely.  So we were there for a few minutes and then one of the same guys from before comes over and says , \"If you're not going to use those two chairs I'm taking them\"  I told him we'd be using them.  He then told me that they had plenty of customers and didn't need us.  I told him I thought he was being rude and overly demanding for no reason and that he wouldn't need to worry about having us as customers again.  Surely there must be other places that are at least as good at service overpriced drinks, trash, no seats, and a rude and hostile staff.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-24", "description": "the beef stew is great here, and it's nice just getting a drink after the work-a-day, but the best part about this place is the fucking insanely loud and powerful hand dryer in the bathroom.  when you use it, every piece of loose paper towel in the room starts flying around like you're in a category 5 hurricane, and you can actually hear it down the block.  be sure to try out this repurposed leaf blower, even if you don't need to pee.", "author": "Michael M."}

It feels like the people that come here just come to hang out and have a good time.  I came with a group of people both times and one time we pulled out cards and started playing drinking games.  There was a couple sitting close to us, kind of towards the older side, and they were full on making out and touching...too much PDA!!  But other than that..the night was fine.  The servers and bartenders here are welcoming and super nice too.  I don't remember if there was music....but eh, don't really need it I guess then.", "author": "Trisha H."}

Weird atmosphere, maybe the staff had a big fight right before I got there.\nI WOULD go back.  (1 more chance.)\n\nIRELAND!!", "author": "Tasty T."}

They have good bar food and its a cute little irish bar. its really vintage and warm like here. maybe its the faux fireplace.", "author": "andree t."}

This place, established in 1996, is under new ownership and back to its true form.  Although outside seating is great it can be crowded, and nothing compared to either St. Patricks Day or Bastille Day.  Little inside info., the French Holiday- Bastille Day (June 5th) is actually the bigger party, shhhhh!", "author": "Dylan T."}
