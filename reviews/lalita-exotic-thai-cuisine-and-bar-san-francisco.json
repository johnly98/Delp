It's a restaurant but nighttime shows neon lights, turn exotic looking bar? It's spacious, I'll give them that, and the wait staff is super fast. They just don't really talk. \n\nFor dinner, we had the following: \n-Crispy chicken with three-flavored sauce for $13.95. Breaded chicken served with bell peppers, tomatoes, pineapples and onions topped with sweet and sour sauce. I'm sorry, what's the \"three flavored\"? It's soggy chicken in sweet and sour sauce. That's it. Not a fan.\n\n-Pad See Ew with chicken for $10.95. Chicken with fresh flat rice noodles, eggs and Chinese broccoli. A little better than the last dish. At least the flavors were there. The chicken was little too dry but with the flavors, I can somewhat overlook that. \n\n-Panang curry with beef for $12.95. Beef with bell peppers, basil and coconut milk. This was the best out of the three. It was served with white rice and the panang was flavorful. \n\nOverall, not the best experience. I've certainly had better Thai food.

I get back to my office, open the box and am about to dig in when I see a nasty black hair in my noodles! Sooo grossss.

Slow night, I guess. As the weather was brisk outside that evening, I went for the $10.50 Roast Duck Egg Noodle Soup, which indeed was a good-size bowl of warm broth with plenty of roast duck, bean sprouts, cilantro, scallions, and spinach leaves (see photo). It was pretty good although there was a tad too much garlic oil since a slick surface developed that made the soup appear less than fresh.\n\nI decided to order a side of the $5.50 Steamed Mixed Vegetables, which is exactly what it was, dominated by a whole lot of cabbage (see photo). I ate my dinner rather mouse-like in the large dining area while the bar was abuzz with drunken revelry as if I was invited to the prom only to be left on a folding chair in the gym next to the shoes. As I was looking above my head to see if there was a bucket of pig's blood ready to be spilled on me, a couple finally came in to eat.

He always says something profound that I wish someone scribed on an olive leaf, napkin, chalupa, or not at all.  \n\nA little fact about DK, he is a LA Dodger fan by birth. I once tricked him into watching a Colt's game where he had $150 on old Payton covering the spread, however, he was too jonesed by the action to know that he was in the midst of the Giants clinching the series in 2010.  To this day, he still cries about confronting a Civic Center exodus of orange and black.  The tears are saltier on even years.\n\nWe like to think of this place as the watering hole for future insurance claims adjusters that are investing in a law education up the street.

I was in a hurry, trying to work backwards to Orpheum theater from food before show. My girlfriend and I each ordered 2 fancy drinks that cost $11 a pop, which was about standard there. Unfortunately no trace of alcohol. My girl ordered a shrimp salad $13, which in hind site I should have ordered. I ordered the \"Boneless Duck with Steamed Vegetables\" $18 with brown rice. Got the plate, had salad, not steamed vegetables... tasted the duck. It was stone cold. Called the server back, she said it doesn't come with steamed veg but we'll give you some, and she would address the cold meat as well. Waited 10 min or so, another young lady brought the plate back, it had salad, steamed vegs, half the amount of meat which looked like it had been deep fried but alas was still cold. So my girl and I feeling pressed for time went ahead and ate the food. While eating we asked the server if we could talk to the manager. She pointed to the opposite end of the building and said, oh she's over there. About ready to lose it after that stupid response, I asked her to go get the manager and send her over. the manager came over and was flabbergasted that I thought there was a problem. After pressing the situation she said she'd take part of the bill off. We had an $80 bill and she took $3 off.

There were proteins we DID NOT ask for. And it took me waving her down from her wonders to come and give us our bill. We were never asked if we needed anything or if it was good. She definitely has her frequent customers as she called them by name but did not bother on the new ones. I have a feeling the food we ate were recycled, or had been sitting on that plate all day.

It's definitely worth taking a look if you're downtown and you're tired of Osha or King of Thai. We were there for a birthday dinner for 4 people and unfortunately it was also the night of the Pacheo/Margarito fight. \n\nThank goodness the staff was so forgiving and understood half the men at the table were going to be occupied at the bar. We literally sat at a long table for almost an hour before getting everyone together to order entrees. My advice for those who have dinner companions who are running late is to order one of their fabulous cocktails 'cause it definitely packs a punch and keeps you mellow. \n\nI ordered the spicy eggplant with chicken and they did not disappoint. The eggplant was seared and tender with a delicate coating of spicy sauce and chili. It was so good I didn't even touch the rice I also ordered with and it wasn't even because they brought me the wrong kind. I love a place that gives you a great balance of vegetables and meat instead of letting one overpower the other. \n\nFor dessert, they brought over ice cream and fried banana covered in chocolate along with tapioca pudding. If you've had fried banana once, you can pass on it here but I thought it was sweet that they added trick candles and sang to all four birthday girls. This restaurant is most definitely a hidden little gem in downtown and with the easy parking, could be an excellent alternative to Osha and King of Thai on a popping Saturday night.", "author": "Jessica K."}

I think my excitement got the best of me since it was just a batter with corn, deep fried. Oil oozing ... lovely. It was ok, not really mind blowing and since I know what it is... check.\n\n- Lemon Grass with Beef = it was just sauteed veggies with beef. It was ok, I assumed that it was going to be grilled since other places have lemon grass beef... but nope. I ate it since I needed protein, it was decent taste but again, nothing too extravagant.\n\n- Stir Fried String Beans and Crispy Tofu in Plik King Sauce (friend ordered this)... and since it looked spicy, I didn't dare touch it. Friend said it tasted ok, not too spicy.\n\n- Pineapple Fried Rice = like my obsession with chocolate chip ice cream, I'm in the hunt for who has the best Pineapple Fried Rice (so far, I think Osha is winning my poll!) Anyway, this was eh... not enough pineapple and it was dry... not moist enough. It had a lot of onions but not enough chicken/shrimp and all the other goodies. \n\n- Sticky Rice with Mango = this was awesome ~ probably the highlight of the night! The presentation was cute and the sticky rice was just the right sweetness to compliment the mango. \n\n- Thai Iced Coffee (me only) = it was strong! Just what I needed to last me for Wicked.\n\nOverall, I was tempted to try their happy hour cocktail menu but I'm off alcohol for now ... so next time. \n\nAmbiance: ok but it has that sexy groove that they want to achieve through their menus. \n\nService: prompt and fast and friendly.\n\nIf your watching a show at the Orpheum... I'd definitely recommend it. Price for the two of us plus tip: ~$60", "author": "Cath M."}

I used to come here all the time and the food was never like this.\n\nThe calamari salad and fried lotus/tofu/yams were fine but everything else tasted like they had a cup of sugar thrown on top.  \n\nI was introduced to Tom Kha (coconut soup) here years ago and it's been one of my favorite soups - I couldn't even eat a few spoons it was so sweet.  Ended up fishing up the shrimp and mushrooms and leaving the soup completely.  It wasn't even remotely spicy nor did it have any flavor other than SWEET.\n\nThe fried whole fish was also a disappointment mainly because of the sauce which was like something off of Panda Express.  Few years ago they had green beans, deep fried basil...now they have some sweet and sour sauce with bell peppers.  Again WAY too sweet.  Sauce did not compliment the fish at all -  it overpowered it.\n\nI'd expect food of this caliber from an all you can eat Asian buffet.", "author": "Crystal G."}

I ate mine with a lot chili sauce on the side (made it a little more enjoyable). \n\nTheir regular menu has typical Thai food offerings - and if you like burning the taste buds off your tongue, they'll help you - as in, they will not hold back at all if you tell them you want your dish spicy.

The bartender Winnie first said only shots then turned around and took drink orders from others. Then she charged $13 for a shot of Jameson and a ginger ale back that wasn't Jameson even Jameson. We watched her use the soda gun and spray coke then give it to us like we didn't just see her. When she tried to give to us she even nudged her friend like she was happy with her self. Then when we told her we saw her she tried to deny it. On top of that we got charged $80 for 6 drinks.  6 drinks which some included beer. Outrageous. I will never go back. Horrible service. Can't believe someone would be that dirty.", "author": "Myrhissa B."}

I went with a large group of friends and sat in the back with the comfortable chairs and benches. They let us play music and just have a great time hanging out and having fun. Everyone here was super friendly, and the service was fast and efficient. They also have a full bar, which is always good!\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the Seafood Deluxe, basically calamari, scallops, and other seafood in coconut sauce, because we weren't exactly ferociously hungry. It was really good, not too sweet but not bland, and especially good with the rice mixed in the sauce. The thai iced tea was standard.\n\nMy friend also let me try some of her chicken wings, and they were fantastic... So good that, If I was vegetarian, I would definitely consider eating meat again.\n\nLalita is a great place for a large group and parties, most definitely.", "author": "Trista B."}

The restaurant had very cute decor. Every table was set neatly. \n\nThe drinks that we ordered: Twisted Thai Ice Tea and Blue Bombay were really served cutely; on a tall glass with some garnish on the Blue Bombay. It was kinda watered down but eh....\n\nWe ordered Angel Wings which was interesting cause we expected traditional chicken wings and got stuffed ones instead with sweet chili Thai dipping sauce. \n\nThe Phad Thai was pretty good. It was on the expensive side but the portion made up for it. \n\nMy girl ordered duck over rice and IT WAS HUGE. \n\nOverall it's a 3-star cause it was kinda expensive but only the portion made up for it. The taste was so-so.\n\nThe waitress and server were really nice though! \nShe even came up and joked if the drinks were too strong cause my girl didn't drink hers yet.

After talking with an Elite friend, I decided to weigh the food subscore more heavily for restaurants.\n\nInspired by the lack of good service, I write a review.\n\nOverall: 3/5\nJust thinking about coming back is distasteful, but the food is actually quite good.\n\nDecor: 0.5\nOur party of six was seated at the backmost booth where most of the light source came from dim lamps, making it hard for me to read the menu or see the food. Otherwise the tables felt clean, and there was plenty of space.\n\nFood: 1 x 2\nI had some flat noodles with pork, basil leaves and bell peppers (and broccoli, but I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist since this vegetable is too advanced for me). Each ingredient tasted good and the dish left me feeling somewhat full. The waiter said it was \"medium\" spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all. Thankfully I asked for hot sauce on the side, so that helped.\n\nPrice: 0.5\nMy noodles were $9.95, an acceptable price when you consider the taste. The cheapest entree was $8.95. Lunch \"specials\" were $11.95 with extra for brown rice and whatnot. OK for San Francisco.\n\nService: 0\nThe experience disappointed me.\nStrike 1 - All our dishes came separately one at a time, and our 6th person didn't even get his until we told two waiters. Was it because it was the same order as another person's? We still got charged the 18% gratuity that applies to parties of 6 or more.\nStrike 2 - There was a spider crawling across the table. Nothing serious but some of us lost our appetite. We did get some tapioca and taro for dessert after, maybe as reparation?\nStrike 3 - We paid our bill in credit cards and bills, expecting some change because we had too many $5s. Nope, we (I) didn't get our change. They must have been indulging in daydreams about their excellent service and helped themselves to a tip.\n\nAnd just as an aside, I had a drink at the bar as well. The woman behind the counter kept snapping at me (or maybe it's the language). But still she seemed impatient with my questions (or maybe it's the culture). The vodka was also overpriced at $3 for basically a sip.", "author": "Brian H."}

The 'pad see ew' was pretty good, as was their salmon, &roasted duck. I thought the portions were a tad small for thai food though &for what we were paying. We also tried their cucumber salad, pumpkin curry, and stir-fried pork with cashews- their pork was a bit stiff and everything else was just mediocre. I also though the pumpkin curry was too sweet for me.\n\nIt does have a nice ambiance and the waitresses are all friendly.

There are too many other good restaurants in the area that will stand by their food and service. \n\nMy story: Lalita is very close to my office so when I'm rushed for lunch with colleagues I end up here...and afterward I usually regret it. The service and quality of food is poor. Today was the final straw. I will never go back. Today I order Thai fried rice and it was terrible. It was unbelievable bland and the chicken seemed old/res-used. I had no choice but to ask for another dish. And when I did, I was told NO. This completely shocked me because I've never went to restaurant that did not stand by their food. Even fast food restaurants guarantee satisfaction. But they said NO and even made me pay for the dish. A dish that I did not eat. Note that this was the owner that I was dealing with.  After such a poor experience in service and food, I came to write this review and discovered that this restaurant has a current health score of 60/100!!! (per Yelp).

Maybe Yelp should also have flair for 100th review like they do for 1st to review.  I would wear said prize with the biggest stupid grin you ever did see.  Shameless self-entitlement aside, let us review some Lalita!\n\nCompared to the mass volume of people who traverse the Civic Center area everyday, there sure aren't many places to eat.  The first thing that attracted me to Lalita was the storefront window seating that was covered with pillows.  I took my girlfriend there the night I saw that and made sure she sat in that place (score +1 for the boyfriend).  In the back of the bar, there is another pillow-filled lounge area that looks like it would be a great deal of fun if you were to have a group of 4 or more drunken friends.  With the kitchy-but-classy decor, the neon-lit bar, and the wait staff who are 100% friendly yet 100% business, I can't resist being thrown into a blissful state of reminiscence of the week I spent in Bangkok a few summers ago.  It must be the nostalgia that keeps me coming back to Lalita.  The edibles and drinkables keep me coming back as well!\n\nTheir fried noodles are the best.  I always get the Pad Kee Mao with beef or the Pad Thai.  The seasonings they use on the meat are very tasty.  The portions are also rather impressive.  I usually just eat a few noodles and then pick the goodies out.  I would like it if there were more veggies in said goodies.  If you like fried things, the appetizer menu has plenty of that.  Whatever you order, you're not very likely to be disappointed.\n\nComplimentary tapioca pudding (w/ taro root) is served when they bring your check.  The pudding is good, but I usually opt to not eat the taro.\n\nI really like the way they make fun drinks.  If you look at the menu, there's not a whole lot of mysteriously-named libations, but all your familiar go-and-get-trashed-while-you're-on-vacation kind of drinks (the PG-13 menu simply lists the 'Adios Motherf***er' as just an 'Adios').  The Twisted Thai Tea (Thai Tea with vanilla vodka) is probably my fave.  With festive containers and fun garnishes, you'll get your swerve on in style.  When we came here to eat the day before the pride festival last year, they had about 10 people lined up along the bar preparing $2 jello shots for the ensuing madness.  The only thing I thought was \"there's no way in Hades you guys are going to be able to make enough jello shots.\"\n\nThe menu is very well priced.

I ordered a vodka soda - the bartendress didn't ask me what kind of vodka I wanted - didn't say a word to me, actually - and immediately grabbed the rail. I did want Absolut Citron, but I'm not one to cause a fuss, so I accepted the drink, paid the $7 (plus $1 tip), and took a sip.\n\nThe drink was awful. \n\nWay too strong, and the vodka was warm. Instead of bothering the now-busy waitress (like I said, I am loathe to give bad reviews), I decided some water to chase the mixed drink would solve the problem. I asked the closest employee (some Asian dude) if I could have a sip of water. He said nothing, scowled a little, and then grabbed a plastic cup, flipped on the tap, filled it up, and shoved it toward me. Then he said, \"One dollar.\" \n\n?!?!?!? \n\nOne fucking dollar? For tap water to wash down your shitty drink?? (He clearly knew I was a paying customer.) I asked him if he was joking and he just glared at me. So I told him I didn't want it anymore. He gave me another dirty look, dumped the tap water down the sink, and returned the plastic cup to its place atop the tower of plastic cups.\n\nNeedless to say - I will never come back here, or brake if I see that guy crossing the street.", "author": "Stephannie N."}

The management is always accommodating for non-profit fundraisers Hastings holds there.  The service is very good and my water cup is never empty.  The price to quality of food ratio is pretty high.  I usually don't pay any more than 12 bucks for a large portioned, tasty entree.  I definitely recommend this place despite what anyone else says.", "author": "David Y."}

The service was quick and, though it wasn't full, there was a good amount of people in the restaurant. We ordered the calamari appetizer, and I got the chicken with spicy basil sauce, dad got the steak. \n\nI love me some calamari. I prefer the salt and pepper Chinese style calamari, with diced jalapenos, but this was just as good. It had a lighter batter, and a sweet sauce drizzled over it.\n\nMy chicken dish was pretty good. I definitely prefer the spicier end of the spectrum though, so when I order something spicy, I expect it to be so. This had a definite spice to it, but was below my expectations. Taste-wise, it was excellent though, lots of flavor. Rice is a dollar extra, and for another extra dollar, you can substitute brown rice.\n\nI had a piece of the steak, and it had a decent crust and good flavor.\n\nThe thai iced tea was a bit pricey, but it was also a pretty decent sized glass.", "author": "Adam P."}

Although the food was not the most amazing thai I've ever had, it was definitely very tasty.\n\nI liked the ambience.

Good size pours, I normally drink Scotch on the rocks but I had several Glenrothes 1997 single malt and it was only $5.00.  This is a $8.00 drink at any other bar in the city and its about $14.00 at Aqua's.  So the drinks are poured deep and they are cheap.\n\nMy friend was drinking Beer, Anchor Steam, offered during happy hour.  I think the Pint size beer was $3.00 this is cheap too. It might had been two for one?? But who knows, I was drinking Scotch. The Bar is nice where you can have a conversation with others.  It's not so noise that you are yelling at one another.  The Bar tender was this cute Asian girl, who kept a descent conversation and not difficult to look at.  But really come of the drinks and the food.\n\nYesterday, I tried had the Duck Fried rice.  The blend between salty and sweet was a perfect match.  The rice was not heavy with oil and MSG. The food had clean flavors and was not greasy like many other Thai restaurants.  The Basil Chicken, breast of chicken sliced, had a mild (requested) spice and sweet blend of the red peppers. \n\nI was extremely happy at the end of the meal.  Good size portions where you're satisfied and not stuffed.  \n\nParking is really easy in the area, I parked on McAllister noticed that there were a lot of spaces.  \n\nAfter dinner, Since we were only a couple of blocks to the clubs, we tanked up on cheap drinks and grabbed a cab.  \n\nI think that Lalita Thai Restaurant is a great place after work for a drink or two...well maybe three.  \n\nLook for me, I'll be the happy guy at the end of the bar drinking Glenrothes by the bottle.", "author": "heavy h."}

We were told by managmenet we would not be able to order a different meal without paying for the first meal even thought we only ate the salad. After argueing with the manager for decent customer service and the fact we mentioned the waitress was unhelpful in advising the correct chicken we were rudelly told by the manager maybe they do not make that type of Thai chicken at their restaurant. The manager proceeding on by insisting we would probaly not like anything on the menu and if they make another meal then their restaurant would have to pay for the loss. We were appauled to say the least! We decided to leave the plate of food and pay for the plate we did have. Once we received the bill we were still billed for the order not eaten. After further disagreeing conversations the manager insisted we pay half for a twelve dollar meal to pay for the salad we had eaten. Although the customer service and experience was less than pleasant we paid for the salad and vowed to never return to this establishment again.", "author": "Evette A."}

Its location isn't the greatest or prettiest, but the food I found to be great.  Further the layout of the restaurant is a bit weird but the drinks and menu items is better than good.  Went on a quiet evening for dinner and ordered the bbq half chicken - and it was die for...I couldn't believe chicken could taste so good. Bravo!", "author": "Tiberius A."}

Everything is moderately priced, and the dishes come very well prepared. Very nice decor as well, especially for the neighborhood. :)\n\nI have eaten at several Thai places in the local area and this is by far the tastiest of the bunch. I have had several of the offerings and they have all been great. Try the ribeye lunch special!", "author": "Sean M."}

By the time i place my order at work, its ready by the time i walk over.. less than 10min. They have a cool bar and nice decor... BUT... when i went there for lunch with about 4 co-workers there were nats flying all over the place. they served us at different times, so peoples food got cold. my co-worker had to kill a nat with her bare hand... GROSS! it gets really crowded during lunch. but for me... i still order my pad thai... take-out. :)", "author": "MaryEllen F."}

The waitress was so rude and I got the feeling that she did not want me there. Writing bad reviews is not my thing but this place left me feeling icky. I just popped in because I had some minutes to kill before an appointment. The waitress/bartender raised her voice to me twice when I asked her about what cocktails she makes. She yelled at me when I asked her about the drink minimum. I think she may have thought I was from the neighborhood because I am not a young hipster/prepster or whatever. I just know that I am not ever going back there again. Don't judge people by looking at them, just try to provide good service. So lame.", "author": "Amber A."}
