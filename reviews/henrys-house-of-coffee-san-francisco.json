I needed some coffee in the morning and decided to get some Espresso from here. I came on a Wednesday and there were people outside chatting and people inside doing work. The cashiers were friendly and the Espresso was great. For $2.50, it's a steal! \n\nThe prices here are really reasonable and I was in and out in like a minute. They do accept Apple Pay here which is really convenient for me. I believe they also roast their own coffee on site and you can smell the great coffee aroma once you enter. \n\nI like Henry's because street parking is easy to find and I can get a jump on my day pretty fast.

They serve food and other espresso based drinks. The service here was friendly and welcoming, a very warm neighborhood joint type vibe which I liked. The only thing which is didn't like that I don't really blame the place is how small it is. Only like 4 tables and coming here thinking there's seating was not a good idea.

I'm a fan of the Costa Rica one, however. \n\nMy suggestions:\n1. Offer a choice of beverage if a full bag (or maybe even half a bag) is purchased. This is a common practice elsewhere. I had to ask firstly whether I would get a stamp on my house of coffee card to go towards a free drink (the answer was no), and then I asked whether they give a cup of coffee to those that purchased bags of coffee. She said I could get a cup if I'd like. I don't like that it wasn't even offered in the first place. Some places even let you choose the type of drink that you'd like. \n\n2. Offer more types of drip coffee than decaf and coffee of the day (seems to usually be French roast).

I don't understand the hype behind Starbucks when their coffee tastes really watered down and although Pete's SHOULD be stronger, I feel it's sometimes even more watered down depending on the bartista. I don't think I've ever had coffee from here that was too watered down plus you get to put brown sugar or honey in your coffee while you're here.\n\nSo apparently the owner roasts the coffee in the early morning hours and imports his beans from all over the world. What's nice is that you get free sesame candy and a free cup of coffee with any purchase of coffee beans even if you only purchased half a pound of beans. That's roughly a $7-$8 bag with all those freebies, mind you. I usually opt for the \"Henry's blend\" of coffee beans. I'm the worst at making decisions and that seems like the typical coffee most people opt for.\n\nAll in all, this place is pretty good for being a mom and pop shop.

HoC offers 3 sizes with different #'s of espresso shots: 2 shots in the small and medium and 4 shots in the large. The prices range between $3-$5 which is reasonable, especially for SF. I opted for the medium since I take my lattes with a \"drip back\" (I usually try the drip coffee after my real drink). \n\nLocation: Pretty nice location. Close to restaurants and other shops. I drove and parking wasn't an issue on the weekend. I parked on one of the side streets so I didn't need to worry about limiting my stay. 1 Hr parking M-S and no restrictions on Sundays.\n\nService: Not much to say other than the cashier was really nice. I asked for a recommendation and she provided a fantastic one. Best of all, I didn't have to wait in line very long! I LOVE short lines. \n\nOther stuff: \n- WiFi worked well for me.

Definitely a more neighborhood feel which is a nice change of pace for the typical SF coffee shop. \n- HoC roasts a pretty wide variety of beans, a few which I am familiar with. I definitely want to see how they roasted the beans in comparison with others I've had in the past. \n\nThere's no WOW factor here but then again.. my standards are exceptionally high right now since I'm in love with Aroma Craft Coffee in SoCal still.

Excellent advice and knowledge of taste and body. Rarely a long wait to grab drip coffee. Parking is usually easy.\n\nMINUS: Coffee shop eats are so easy and could be so good here, but they're not. Stale pastries wrapped in cheap cellophane, microwaved breakfast sandwiches (which can be delicious if done properly) that are sometimes bad and sometimes worse (inconsistent.) The staff is hit and miss; high turnover in the last few years. I have never been able to pick out a manager or supervisor behind the counter. Seemingly loose working environment.

This place is so charming that it almost seems out of place amidst all the morning dim sum bakeries and Chinese supermarkets that populate this general area.

I ordered the kona mocha, with which I was initially disappointed with because I had not realized that it was a frappe type drink. But even for a silly-looking iced drink that comes in a translucent portable cup, it's ridiculously strong. It was so strong that I had forgotten what I had that morning until the next day when I looked in my fridge and found a doggy bag of dim sum on the top shelf left over from the day I went.\n\nNow that I've gribbled on enough, the establishment is very cozy and quaint; it's almost as if they have one of those old school steamers in the back somewhere and that's where they bring out all the coffee from.

I want them to be fresh, and I prefer medium roasts to \"French\" or \"City\" roasts. At the same time I need the acidity to be well-controlled, which tends to be more pronounced in lighter roasts. It's tough to find all that. I've given up on Starbuck's, Peete's, and the local supermarkets. But I struck gold at Henry's House of Coffee.\n\nLiving on the peninsula, I had done an online search for roasters in the area and Henry's House of Coffee came up. They seemed to have a lot of different roasts available, so I resolved to give them a try. Once there, I explained my preferences to the baristas at the counter, and they recommended the \"Vista Alegre\" beans. Visually they looked good: Modest size beans, medium brown and without all the surface oil of the darker roasts. Promising! I bought the beans and got a free coffee and some candy along with them. Nice touch!\n\nAt home I pulled an espresso shot from those beans. It was fantastic. Just what I hoped for. Full of chocolate and caramel flavor, sweet, full-bodied, and without being overly acidic. Vista Alegre is my new favorite coffee, though I look forward to trying some of Henry's other medium roasts over the coming weeks.", "author": "Matthias S."}

Because it's a Shrine to many of the worlds finest coffees, a San Francisco original roaster (and yes, Henry still roasts beans himself using decades of skill, intuition and appreciation for the art. You can stand and watch, ask questions, learn some local history, smell the beans). Jamaican Blue Mountain Reserve! Kona King! Galapagos! Yemen, Bella, two kinds of Costa Rican, come on! Cruise the world of coffee right here. (and he ships)\n\nI know (and adore) the owner, Henry, I know the staff, their skills, dedication and professionalism in serving San Francisco's wonderfully diverse customer base with a guaranteed quality, satisfying product and a smile every day. The House of Coffee isn't \"Corporate Coffee\", momentarily fashionable or littered with glam, hipsters, attitudes, laptops and a rude silence. Real people come here, for generations, because it's just that good all of the time. I have had a hundred cappuccino's at House of Coffee, (and actually drank them) without encountering a single problem on either side of the counter but if there ever was, the staff would gladly fix it. \n\nThat being said, I take great offense at someone posting a \"review\" like the one below because it isn't true, honest, fair or unbiased - all of the characteristics that responsible (and sane) Yelp users are supposed to consider before barfing a slanderous, crazed rant. I am very familiar with both the owner, Henry, and most of his experienced staff, all of whom are dedicated to providing a quality product in a friendly, courteous manner to every customer. Every barrista that has made me a cappuccino at Henry's House of Coffee (I only drink the very best cappuccino, and have even had a few in Berkeley) has done so with the requisite experience and craftsmanship, and always exactly as ordered. The employees are local people, genuine, knowledgeable and friendly.

I went your venue because of good reputation for coffee, and I am a huge fan for good local small roasted coffee; but this is what I got: \n\nYour \"just-out-of-high-school\" barista who didn't even know how to use the expresso machine made me some caffein mixture under another young man's supervision. Milk foam was not right, texture was not right, temperature was not right, not to mention the foam was almost coming out of the cheap paper cup. And the worse was the staff's attitude towards my disappointment. \n\nWhen I try to ask the young Asian man, who seemed to have some experience, to make me a better cup, he took out money from cashier and yielded at me to get out of there, like I was some homeless beggars; especially when I was just expressing my disappointment about the coffee, not money. \n\nDuring this little scene, this  just-out-of-high-school chick, or someone who just used expresso machine to make some chemical mixture wanted to join the fight by telling me that my highly-coffee-craving voice volume was \"rude\", quote, \"you were rude when you just came in\", when all I said to her was \"A-single-cappuccino-please\", twice. \n\nIn the end, I had to travel to the other side of town to go to Ritual. \n\nThis is beyond no respect, this incident is an insult!

Something you would expect from a place called \"House Of Coffee\" after all. Not only did I get coffee, but I got AWESOME coffee. \n\nHere's the deal, I love coffee.. I practically drink more than plain water. (I know, I know, not really a healthy choice.. ) Anyway, I've been buying beans from the typical bean suppliers here in the city for a while. Four Barrel, Ritual, Sight Glass, Blue Bottle, etc.. And I have to say, those guys are really doing something wrong. They boast their roast, but when you compare their roast to the masters, you quickly see what's going on. They are under roasting their beans. \n\nI recently did a taste test, we brewed up some Four Barrel \"Friendo Blendo\", Ritual \"El Angel\", Sight Glass \"Owls Howell\", and Blue Bottle \"Steppes\", and compared them to the \"Thailand AA\" beans from House of Coffee. \n\nAll of the coffees were made using the same methods. I used an Aero Press, with the exact same amount of grinds from the same grinder and setting and the same temperature water. (Roughly 195 degrees)\n\nThe results were astounding! \n\nFour Barrel was very \"bright\" and sour.\nRitual was exactly the same.\nSight Glass was slightly less so and a little sweet lacked bite.\nBlue Bottle was bright, but  a bit sweet and lacked that \"espresso\" bite. \n\nHouse of Coffee Thailand AA was spectacular. It was exactly what I would expect from a perfectly roasted bean. \n\nOne of the reasons I believe the others beans are under roaster is that a. if you look at them, they are nearly tan in color.. Coffee beans need to be dark brown.\nThe other reason is that when you use a hand grinder to grind your beans, you really get a \"feel\" for the roast. The under roasts lack the oils and the beans are harder, so the grinder has to work harder. Whereas a well roasted bean lubricates the grinder as its going through, making the grinding process go a lot quicker and smoother. Yielding grinds that haven't been re-heated due to friction in the grinder.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a master roaster who knows his beans and coffee, go to House of Coffee.. If you are looking for over priced hipster coffee, go with the others.", "author": "Mark C."}

The coffee was fine, but didn't really taste all that fresh. It wasn't a big deal though since I came at ten after five and they close at six, so I wouldn't expect fresh coffee (I used to be a barista and I KNOW that when you're that close to closing you're not making fresh coffee). The cookie was pretty good as well. You can tell it wasn't fresh baked since it was wrapped in plastic (as were the muffins and croissants), but like I said it still tasted good. \n\nThey don't have a lot of fancy shmancy drinks on the menu; just your basic coffee and espresso based drinks, but I think that's the point. The guy who runs it seems to be very passionate about all things coffee. For such a tiny place they carry a lot of coffee makers, presses, tumblers, etc., as well as teas, jams, and those sort of things. \n\nThere isn't a lot of seating (a couple tables inside and a couple tables outside), and I thought the set up was a little funky (there appeared to be a large storage room in the back and the \"office\" was set up out front for all the customers to see).

There really is very little room to stay and drink, but for me that wasn't an issue. I got a cappucino (std fare for me) and it wasn't anything spectacular. It's not an issue with how they made it, which was a-ok, but just a personal preference for less flavor... I prefer something a bit smoother that blends with the steamed milk more. I felt like the espresso overpowered the milk a bit. Still, this is just a preference thing, and if you're into the particular flavor of their espresso I think you'd be perfectly happy with your cappucino.\n\nBut what I really want to give them props for is their coffee. Having never been here before I told the woman at the cash register that I wasn't sure what I wanted but I wanted something that wasn't too rich, but still around a medium roast. She suggested Henry's blend, which she said was a blend of medium and dark roast. This sounded like it would be too dark, but I took her advice and purchased half a pound.\n\nHad them grind for French Press, and drank a couple of cups via that method........WOW....supremely smooth, but still a nice flavor. Every aspect of the flavor is great. I feel like I could drink it all day every day!\n\nFuture reviews as I try more roasts!!", "author": "Josh S."}

When you drink their cup of coffee, all you get is flavor. Especially when the coffee of the day is of a dark roast. Even when it's not dark roast, the coffee is still pretty strong. I still can't drink it black so I just put a minimal amount of milk and sugar. Only the coffee from here can keep me wired for a good portion of the day unlike Starbucks coffee or coffee from any other store. It's also pretty cool to be able to see the beans being roasted right in front of your eyes and the store suddenly fills up with this heavenly coffee aroma which you can smell all the way down the street as well.\n\nThe customer service is also pretty amazing. They usually sell these cookies from the Nutty Cookie company and they had the best Lemon Butter cookie I've ever tasted. One day I went back for the Lemon Butter Cookie but it was out of stock. I went back again and they still didn't have it so the owner Henry promised to order it and have it stock for me the next time.  To my amazement, everytime I've been back there, the Lemon Butter cookie have been fully stocked. Talk about going out of your way to please your customers.\n\nIf you don't drink coffee or want something different, I'd recommend trying the loose leaf teas. I believe the owner prepares them himself and they are definitely fully packed with flavor not to mention the wide selection. \n\nIf you want to prepare coffee and tea at home, there are a bunch of great gadgets sold at the store at reasonable prices. Watch out for the sales. That's how I got my thermo tumbler for cheap.\n\nIf you haven't been to this coffee house run by a 4th generation coffee roaster who has mastered the art and beauty of great tasting coffee, I'd recommend you pay a visit soon!", "author": "Dorothy W."}

Roast) and it was/is one of the smoothest, most satisfying coffees I ever drank.\n\nI told Henry he should sell it under some psuedonym (Like Henry's Blend 2?) because he said he sells a lot of it. But it is NOT on the menu, so one would never know he would make it for you (I'm talking an LB of beans, not a cup) unless you knew. He calls it KSF.\n\nI've talked coffee with Henry for years and he knows what blends together and what doesn't. Sometimes I'll ask for a weird combo (Panama and Costa Rica for example) just to try something new but Henry will shake his head and tell you the acidity will be way too high, etc. Trust him. He came up with Henry's Blend after obviously trying many variations and it remains my #1 favorite with KSF now #2.\n\nAnd for you Sunset oldtimers. I read a Chron article that indicated there was a bowling alley in the Sunset in the 70's. I moved to the Sunset in 71 but never recalled any bowling alley out there so who to ask but Henry!

This is something I missed dearly when I was living in Amherst, MA. House of Coffee caught my eye because of the updated and pretty exterior, amongst many of the run down and drab store fronts along Noriega St. \n\nLet me preface this by saying I am not a coffee aficionado in anyway, despite having been put through a lame \"bean school\" course during my stint as a Starbucks Barista. (I know, I slummed it to put myself through college...at least I didn't wear clear heels.) I do however drink coffee every day when I have an office job.\n\nI usually only drink drip coffee when served with breakfast, so I can't say what theirs taste like. However, I would consider buying some of their beans in the near future. I went with my \"go to\" drink, which is a hazelnut latte. I didn't really pay attention to price, but it was three something. About what I would expect to spend. \n\nThe espresso was good, and the drink was not overly sweet. The service was good/average. The barista asked me if I would like any cinnamon or cocoa sprinkled on top. For the average coffee drinker, I would say that it is definitely above Starbucks, and more comparable to Peets, in terms of quality. Although it looks like other reviewers are saying it is way better than Peets. \n\nI liked how clean and modern the coffee shop was. There were also a few tables and chairs for sitting, and coffee, tea, etc products for purchase. I noticed they offered bagels and breakfast sandwiches, but don't expect to come here and order a fancy sandwich and salad with your coffee like some other places in SF. It is not a lunch spot.\n\nIt is nice to find a good coffee spot in the neighborhood that is not filled with bums and crackheads, or pretentious yuppies on their laptops. It seems quaint and relaxed. Somewhere locals can hang out. Although I would have to return a few times to really assess what the clientele is like.

They would get more stars if they had a better selection of pastries to go with the coffee.", "author": "p w."}

When I came in, I saw all the biscuits and snacks I normally have in Germany, and I became nostalgic. While their drinks are a higher price than that of your chain shops (ie Starbucks), they are much more a friendlier place. They even know your name if you're a regular! Well I guess some Starbucks locations do the same, but I think they only do that to attempt recreating the individualistic feeling that usually comes from coffee shops such as this.  I'm not too big on coffee so I had hot chocolate, but boy this hot chocolate was much better and did not have that weird taste like the Starbucks one. It did take a little bit longer to prepare the drink, but I think that is much better than having a pre-made package prepared for you in 30 seconds.", "author": "Yosie G."}

What a nice gift that was!  We're pretty picky about coffee, so we were hoping it was going to be good...  And, sure enough, it didn't disappoint!  It was excellent!  ...Bold and smooth at the same time!   Can't wait to try some of the other roasts and blends!  It looks to us that Henry's got a knack for this!", "author": "Caroline S."}

Once you have tasted House of Coffee's quality, you will never go back to Starbuck's or Peet's.  I do owe it to those other places for raising the bar but it would be like comparing hand-made Belgian chocolate to Hershey's.  \n\nA true coffee lover must try this place.  Vista Allegre beans are my all-time favorite.  Smooth, intense and beans here are roasted daily in small batches (which coffee afficionados know means optimum flavor).  Service is wonderful, expertise is unparalleled.  The owner is a 4th generation roaster whose family even trained Peet at one time!", "author": "Serena L."}

This place has been around since I was little and I'm so glad it 's still here.  It was my best-kept secret until now.  The coffee is amazing because the owner roasts his own beans right there.  Local, small businesses like this just aren't around anymore so please stop by to try this amazing coffee.  My caveat is that this coffee isn't for the pseudo coffee drinkers who like super sweet coffee.  It's for the true coffee lovers.  And please don't whine about the wait.  It's one owner and his barista.  It's not an assembly line of workers giving you syrupy sweet mochas per protocol.  These are true coffee drinks made with care.", "author": "Dorothy W."}
