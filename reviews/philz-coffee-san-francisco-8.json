Shows my power of observation. But I walked in one faithful Saturday to be met with joy and professionalism from the alchemist barista, Rob. He is a man of myth and splendor that made me the most tasteful and tantalizing iced coffee of my life; the Mint Mojito. Because of this rewarding experience, which absolutely brightened my day, I will be back for further Mint Mojitos and other delicious hot/cold beverages. Thank you Rob - my Barista of the Month. \n\nQuick Note: try their croissants  they are also delicious and light, flakey. Pair well with any coffee.", "author": "Chris O."}

Decided to Yelp the closest location to my hotel and it brought me here.  Wish I read the reviews before I ventured off.  My directions from my hotel lead me through streets full of homeless people.  I will not lie, I was afraid.\n\nHappy I got to my destination without incident.  It was early morning so the iced mint mojito was not what I was ordering, but what was recommended by my friend.  Asked my barista for a recommendation because it was my first time here.  She recommended Tesora and I like it.  I also got the Mediterranean Avocado & Egg Toast, yummers.  \n\nShop had a few patrons when I arrived but shortly after 7am there was a line that included several police officers.  \n\nLots of seating and outlets, a major plus.  \n\nNeed to return to try that mint mojito, but maybe I'll try a different location.", "author": "Bessie B."}

Our delivery order was scheduled to arrive on Monday, April 30th between 9:30am and 10am. It arrived via Caviar around 9:45am.\n\nJacob's Wonderbar: Dark chocolate, smoke, and nuts ($3.50)\n*Hot\n*Large (+$1)\n*No cream or milk\n*No sweetener\n\nI used to drink coffee all the time, but I've been more into tea in the recent years. I wasn't sure what to order, so I decided to go for a dark roast as that's what I used to love. The description of this one sounded the best, so I just went for it. I'm definitely a coffee purist, so I just got it black. The coffee was very strong. Especially for someone that doesn't drink coffee as much anymore. (I do make a few cups of drip coffee every morning, but it's not very strong.) I appreciated the intensity, but it was a little too much for me. It did give me a nice caffeine rush as I felt slightly spazzy afterwards.\n\nI never really got on the Philz coffee wave as I stopped drinking coffee as much after they got popular. They do serve a quality cup though.", "author": "Elena N."}

And while we're on the topic, with the patrons who are packing this place?  For goodness' sake, baristas, you're working a service job in a coffee shop. In the Tenderloin, no less.  I've known concertmeisters with less attitude.\n\nFor my sins, I suppose, I waited in line in this godforsaken pile of hipster entitlement just long enough to ponder its many lessons in how not to run a business. You'd think something as simple as dispensing a hot cuppa joe made pourover style, possibly adding a snack, and getting me out the door less stressed than when I arrived would have been mastered by Philz by now. And you'd certainly think they'd have figured out how to get it to you hotter than a baby bottle.\n\nIt was a very simple transaction that I asked of them today, but not so routine that not one, but both baristas could resist using their three minutes of customer interaction to see how much one-upsmanship and snark they could inflict upon their luckless patrons enroute to mixing them a tepid cup of gritty brew with a side of stale carbs . \n\nIt's quasi-Turkish coffee, a beverage that has lubricated conversation and cross-cultural understanding as the ultimate symbol of convivial hospitality for millennia:  just one of a million ironies that are lost on these insufferable, sub-competent fools.\n\nCater-corner to a law school and the federal building, I contemplated what I'd rather see in its place as I waited a ridiculous 12 minutes for my 16 ounces of overpriced disappointment. It arrived sporting an unspanked sprig of mint that went about as well with the coriander and coffee flavors as a squirt of Worcestershire.  I was momentarily distracted by having to use two hands and a foot to pull a section off the world's toughest and stalest cinnamon roll that seemed to have been made of wood putty and spackle mixed with enough sugar to make my fillings ache, but soon the vision swam into view:\n\nA Dunkin Donuts.  Yep, that would be great. Law students late to class would know with 100% certainty that their freshly ground, freshly brewed drip would be ready on time.  Pastry would be tender and unselfconsciously bad for you.  Service persons would have to wear little pink uniforms that would drain the smirk out of them so fast that they wouldn't get have to get fired for talking to customers the way these \"servers\" do all day long without a twinge of conscience.  Blue collar folk like the security guards from the Federal building, unhip matrons getting their passports before the trip of a lifetime, and bewildered tourists would be treated with dignity.  Tenderloin predators would get the bum's rush.  It would cost $2 for a big cuppa joe, and lord a mercy, IT WOULD BE HOT.\n\nA girl can dream.", "author": "Shoshi D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-06", "description": "On 6/1/2017, glorious Thursday morning, I visited here in San Francisco, CA to explore this another well known Bay Area franchise coffee shop located near SF City Hall at Civic Center called, \"Philz Coffee.\" Philz Coffee serves the customers to enjoy and slip their finest cafe drinks and treats every 365 days a year; from morning to evening! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most Philz Coffee has across California, and for this Golden Gate Avenue location, it's much old fashion modern filled with wooden backgrounds and indie decors across the whole interior room.\n\nThe baristas here are doing a great job for making the customers like me a sensational service despite the moderate environment. No cons at all!\n\nNow onto the drinks! I did ordered the Philharmonic with a fresh mint on top. As I drank it, that drink was perfectly amazing and tremendously good; closely better just like their Embarcadero location. Also, their fresh vegan made coconut donut tasted flawless! Very eatable and moist; not too harden and dry! Not a bad way to start the morning right!\n\nParking at the Philz Coffee at Golden Gate Avenue can be challenging to park. You can park at their nearby surface street parking if it's available. You can also ride a bike, walk, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Philz Coffee at Golden Gate Avenue is the most remarkable local coffee shop from the Bay Area that I've ever visited. A well received visit indeed! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-19", "description": "This Philz is very busy, as it serves everyone working near Civic Center. It's fairly spacious with a variety of seating options, which is great for meeting up or just getting some work done. I've heard that were issues with rowdy homeless people coming in and now they have a security guard posted at the entrance, but I've never had an issue and I feel like this is unnecessary (I seem to recall a former barista writing an open letter online regarding similar issues at one of their South Bay stores). Parking is exactly what you'd expect for such a busy part of the city, but much better on Sundays when it's free all day and no one is around.\n\nMy recommendations:\n- My favorite blends to drink black are probably Philtered Soul and Hazelnut.\n- Sometimes I like doing half Philtered Soul and half Yerba Mate, which gives the coffee a more herbal flavor. Not everyone's cup of tea (haha get it), but it's an interesting alternative if you wanna try something different.\n- If you want something on the sweet side, go for a White Christmas - 1/2 Greater Alarm + 1/2 Hazelnut with cinnamon and nutmeg in the filter, sweet and creamy.\n- On a hot day, look no further than the Iced Coffee, extra sweet, extra creamy. Terrible for the arteries, wonderful for the soul :) The Mint Mojito and iced Mocha Tesora are also great options!\n- The food here is good, but pricey. If I wanna treat myself, I'll get the avocado toast with egg.", "author": "Joe M."}

The coffee is just so good!  \n\nCompared to other Philz stores, though, this one has some unique challenges:\n\nFirst of all, the bathroom here just seems to be consistently dirtier than other Philz locations.  Take this morning for instance:  I'm not sure if this is simply the way that the bathroom gets cleaned but there was about 1/2 inch of water all over the floor.  The staff knew about it because they had put up one of those yellow A-frame signs that said \"Wet Floor.\"  Now it didn't smell bad (like the wet floor was the result of an accident).  But all the same, it was weird and a little disturbing. Perhaps they are simply cleaning the bathroom more often due to the volume of foot traffic at this location?  \n\nSecond, some of the furniture just seems a little dirtier than at other Philz.  Again, perhaps it is just a busier Philz than most, so there's just more wear and tear. It's not a barrier to coming here, but it's just not as nice compared to other Philz around the Bay Area.\n\nAll of the above is not to suggest that this is a bad place.  The wifi is pretty fast.  The music is good.  The staff is super-friendly and there is plenty of seating.\n\nIf we could award 1/2 stars, then this would get a 4 1/2  Since we can't give 1/2 stars, however, I need to give this place 4 stars since it's not quite at the same level as other Philz stores.", "author": "Paul O."}

But because I was in SF and needed a cup of java, I make my way through the tenderloin to this urban coffee oasis and pick up a small cup of the Hazelnut and chocolate flavored \"Philtered Soul\". It is an enjoyable and warm bodied cup of coffee that was perfect for the cold winter morning. I was expecting the taste of nutella in it but that wasn't the case. The nutty flavors were very subtle, and I didn't notice the chocolate. It was an enjoyable cup of coffee nonetheless, but it didn't kick me in the face as much as the vietnamese coffee I've been used to drinking most of my life, which has only one real flavor. \n\nI can totally see the appeal, and the coffee is quite good. There are a variety of flavors to choose from, and i'm sure someone who is a coffee aficionado would be able to go to town here and try everything on the menu.

There is a mix of high top counter and stools, regular tables and chairs, and even some lounge chairs for chillin'.  Not a coffee drinker, I ordered a hot chocolate (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sykCI9zAmplzgoayjfw9og&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q), paid for it at the cashier, and waited for my order to be prepared.  After getting my hot drink from the barista, I found a high top stool near the restroom, strategic you know.  After settling in, I checked on my emails and texts while waiting for a possible call from my attorney. As time passed, I noticed that there was a security guard in a blue jacket standing by the restroom, thinking 'that's interesting'.

I glanced at the guard to make sure I was okay in using the unisex restroom and all was good.  \nDespite of this, I felt safe here as the customers seemed to be a mix of Hastings Law students (campus just a block or two away) and idle working government staff (Federal and State Buildings within a block).  \nThough I won't make a special trip here, it was certainly nice to find a warm and safe haven for a few hours.", "author": "Mike C."}

So I'm not a huge coffee drinker but I do enjoy a nice latte from Starbucks on occasion. It's not that I don't like coffee, caffeine is just funny with my body most times. However, I was up early for a morning bike ride and one of my friends recommended Philz as a must do in San Francisco so I decided it was one of those morning that I could tolerate caffeine. And boy, my taste buds were happy and the caffeine kick was great for my bike ride (no upset stomach or headache here). The space was great, I wasn't sure where to stand while ordering or where to wait but that's because I'm a newbie. However there was plenty of seating in the big open space. Also I noticed a security guard guy standing near the bathroom, not sure what that was all about but I didn't question it further. So based on my friend's recommendation I ordered the Iced Mint Mojito. I took a chance because I'm actually not a fan of mojitos or mint in general. Weird because I guess I am now because I loved the Iced Mint Mojito! The barista asked about the sweetness and I was super confused but mentioned I don't like things too sweet so he said he'll make it less sweet and could add more sweetness if I wanted. It was perfect. Super refreshing and even though there was a good amount of fresh muddled mint in the cup it wasn't overpowering. I also got the Mediterranean avocado toast with sliced hard boiled egg. Good bread and the herb oil \"Mediterranean\" was a nice twist. \n\nI am also SO EXCITED that Phliz has come to my hometown of Washington, DC.

First one was from Santa Monica and I absolutely hated it...but since I was in SF, I thought I'd give Philz another try in hopes it would change my mind given the fact that Philz originated in SF.\n\nWelll..............it only changed my mind a teensy bit. :|\n\nTo summarize quickly, my first experience was terrible.  Every sip I took, I'd end up with leaves in my mouth.  I took off the lid to see what was going on..only to find an entire bush of mint leaves in my cup.  I literally had to fish it all out before drinking my coffee--which I didn't finish.\n\nTHIS TIME... I made sure to let the barista know I wanted my coffee to only have a little bit of mint...she looked a bit confused at first so I said \"less minty\" and then she knew what I meant.  She also asked if I wanted my coffee to be \"sweet and creamy because that's what most people get\" so I said sure. I didn't know you could choose the level of sweetness because my barista didn't ask me... I only found out later when my friend told me :|  \n\nWhen I finally got my coffee, I snapped a couple pictures first because it looked so good and photogenic.  I took a sip...expecting fireworks but it was just okay.  It's basically just minty iced coffee... and it wasn't as sweet as I had expected it to be.  By all it means, it was better than my first cup from Santa Monica but it still isn't something I'd go out of my way for.  Not mention, $4 for a small is pretty pricey IMO. \n\n I just can't pin point as to why people rave about Philz so much :(  No more for me.. I'll stick with Starbucks :T", "author": "Regina O."}

Professor of Italian Studies for an American College Semester Abroad Program in Siena, Italy.  As an evaluator of students' academic performances, it was also incumbant upon me to observe. -& monitor when necessary -their moral &  ethical compasses along with their manners & appropriate levels of maturity\nwhen interacting not only in the classroom.but also in any other professional setting. With such a vast amount of experience in this filed, I can now tell you how impressed I am with Sean Tate, an employee at your lovely place on Golden Gate. Yesterday morning, I had to re-charge my Fiat 500 E , & the closest place was at the nearby Civic Center Garage, a facility I had never used before. When I arrived at the  station on Level 2, it was noon. I took out my back pack & computer, and since no one was around the parking lot, I posit the items on the ground in front of my Fiat & then went to the pump-only a few feet from the front-to get it discharged, & as I turned around to plug it in my 'e-tank,' to my horror I saw a very unsavory young man clutching my items in one hand while wielding a knife towards me in his other one. Paralized with fear,  I heard the thug say, \" Don't yell or move an inch,\" after which he  then fled away. Shaken to the core, I went to the guard's station to report the ugly incident. Luckily, I had my wallet on me. As I walked out of the dark garage, I meandered out into the light of day,  dazed & numb with incredulity of the unexpected the terror I had just experienced. I asked a passer by if he knew of a good coffee shop & he pointed me to your place. As I made my way to get served, Sean greeted me & asked what I'd like. I then told him of what I had just gone through, & I must let you know how genuinely concerned & kind he was. He went out if his way to ask me if there was anything he might be able to do to help me in any way possible. I was so impressed with this young man immediately upon hearing him say that to me. It is indeed a rarity to find this kind of gentlemanly compassion which he also impressively demonstrated with much finesse & class. I will always remember this young man, & now Philz on Golden Gate will be one of my favorite new destinations in the Philz Galazy to enjoy a cup of your delectable coffee & goodies because of my most positive experience I had with with your employee, Sean Tate.", "author": "Franco N."}

My friend and I came here yesterday-- she ordered a small mint mojito and I ordered a large one. Hers had too much muddled bits and pieces of mint while mine had too much  whole mint leaves bunched up at the bottom, that basically took up half the cup. I was a little disappointed with my drink since I barely got any coffee (I probably had more mint leaves than liquid).  Granted we had different baristas prepare our drinks-- I would have thought that there would be more conformity in the way drinks were made.\n\nSince I don't go to a particular Philz when I want my mint mojito iced coffee fix, I can't recommend a particular branch or barista to make the best coffee drink... But one thing I would recommend is to ask for less ice and not too much mint (be it muddled bits or whole mint leaves and stems).  If you tell your drink maker this, you'll probably won't go wrong!

I drink coffee 1-3 times a day. Don't judge me... :P\n\nThe boyfriend and I paid $9 for 2 \"large\" iced coffees. First, why the hell do they serve iced coffee in hot cups? Second, their large size is more like a medium. When I say I want a large, I want a large (maybe it's just the addict talking in me). Third, they serve you your cup of coffee with no lid on top. How many times have people spilled all over their floors and counters? They have lids available for you to put on yourself but come on.. I'm paying almost $5 for a drink; they could at least put a lid on. This is madness.\n\nI thought the taste would make up for all these weird things but nope. I got anesthesia to the upside (a medium roast) over ice. They ask you if you want cream and sugar and then sweeten it for you. That would be fine if they made it taste good but they didn't. It barely had any sugar. The coffee didn't even have a good flavor. It said it was supposed to have blueberry accents to it but I didn't taste anything.\n\nThat was the first time I haven't finished my coffee.

(Canada, Hawaii, New York, L.A. before their opening in Santa Monica, Hong Kong, Philippines)  \n\nThat included my wife when she moved to the Bay Area.  Throughout our entire courtship and visits to her and her family, I came to visit them with Philz Coffee in tow, explaining to them that an in-person visit is a non-negotiable.  When we got married and she moved to the Bay Area, I made sure Philz was one of her first stops. (Actually, IT WAS her first stop)  Around the same time, attrition of the awesome staff began and instead of replacing themselves with someone just as awesome as those who departed, it seems that they were just filling in bodies behind the counter.  \n\nThen the prices went up.  \n\nThen I learn to ween away from coffee after being an everyday drinker for over five years.  Granted, customer service in corporate attempted to find a solution including gift cards and an open dialogue via email. \n\nBut the damage was already done. I learned to do without coffee and I was able to return to being a \"once a week\" or \"every other week\" coffee drinker just as I was prior to discovering Philz.  \n\nBeing nostalgic, I returned there.  (I'm sorry the definition of \"insanity\" according to Mark Twain is what?)  I inquired if there existed a water filtration system for the water.  The puzzled staff brushed me off.  \n\nHere's the thing.  If you're in a business where your main product is 95+% water, there should be some care into the quality of the water, shouldn't it?  And I'm not just singling out Philz.  Almost every corner in the SF Bay Area has a spot where coffee and tea are their main products.  I'm using this Philz location as a soapbox for this concern because of how much loyalty was paid to this specific location, and the prices.  If you could raise prices to offset costs in providing better benefits for your staff when the quality of your staff was in decline, then it wouldn't hurt to invest into improving the quality of your water.  It's not rocket science.  \n\nFive stars for what it once was, and (negative) one star for it's current state.  Averages to three stars.", "author": "Terrence P."}

There was no line for customers, with about 4 people waiting for their drinks by the register.  So I was surprised that I had to wait over 10 minutes to place my order.  (I checked since I had a BART train to catch.)  I counted six employees standing around (not on break) behind the counter with only one actively making coffee (and another preparing bagels).  \n\nBy the time I placed my order, a long line had formed back to the door, yet none of the other employees thought they should step forward to help out.  My coffee took another 10 minutes, and the barista had to be reminded of my order.  Not a huge deal, I know, but it just adds to the frustration of waiting nearly 20 minutes and already feeling like the customer isn't a priority.\n\nThe whole place felt a bit disorganized and lazy - quite the opposite of what I'm used to with Philz down in Santa Monica.

And most importantly, it's not as crowded. The only downside is that it's close to the Tenderloin, so walking here from downtown is a stink-fest.\n\nThe difference between the small and large mint mojito ice coffee is only 50 cents, so it's worth the upgrade.

Once I get bored of the mint mojito, I'll try their other specialties... but honestly, does anyone get tired of this popular Philz drink?\n\nService is very friendly and welcoming, as always.

The location itself isn't the greatest but  riff raff seem to stay away for the most part, perhaps because cops are always ordering coffee. Definitely roomie and more chill then the nearby Van Ness location.", "author": "Sabrina D."}

Philz doesn't serve espresso, though. I understand that they'd want to distinguish themselves from all of the other coffee shops, but I wasn't crazy about having to get a whole cup of coffee (too much caffeine for the afternoon). I decided to get it anyway and not finish the cup, and ordered \"Jacob's\" dark roast.\n\nAll of the coffee is made to order, which isn't a bad thing, but what's up with not taking a name or giving you a number when there are dozens of others waiting for their coffee?  \n\nThe coffee was good, but nothing to rush back for. I also don't see the need for so many different blends; I suspect Phil (I assume there is or was a Phil, right?) would be fine with just light, dark, or mixed, and does this to cater to the clientele's need for their own special preferred choice.  \n\nNot planning on rushing back, but will go there in a pinch (i.e., if I need a jolt and the only alternative is Starbucks).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-08", "description": "Philz Coffee took care of me today. They made a mistake but then made up for it. Here's the story:\n\nThis morning I rushed out of my house and into a Lyft to get to my first day of jury duty by 8:45 AM. I arrived right on time but there was a HUGE line and I hadn't had any coffee or breakfast yet. When I saw the line, I looked up \"coffee\" on my trusted Yelp app and was thrilled to find out that there was a Philz 0.2 miles away. I've tried a cup of Philz but never been into a Philz coffee shop before. \n\nI used my speed-walking skills to get me into Philz fast. The line was long-ish but moved very quickly with the efficient set-up. I chose my coffee and the barista asked if I wanted it \"dark or medium\" and then \"sweet or not so sweet.\" Without coffee and never having been to Philz before, this did not translate to milk or sugar to me and instead I just answered the questions. Then I went to pay at the cashier and chose the ginger scone to munch on (very good but I had decision remorse that I hadn't chosen the Philz bagel with cucumbers, etc. but I can have that next time!).\n\nI then eagerly awaited my coffee- the original barista who'd started making my coffee had swapped out and someone else finished it for me and told me I was doing good by going to jury duty. I walked out thrilled with my coffee and tasted it - it was delicious... but creamy. Unfortunately I'm self-diagnosed lactose intolerant and soon I had an awful stomach ache. I sadly threw out the rest of my coffee.\n\nWhen I did not get picked for the jury around 2:45 pm, I hustled back over to Philz and re-ordered my coffee but was very specific that I'd like soy milk and an equal. I explained to the cashier what had happened this morning and she sweetly apologized and said this coffee was definitely on the house. The Turkish coffee that I chose (for the second time today) was just perfect and I LOVED it! I hope for more Philz soon... but hopefully no more jury duty!", "author": "Meghan P."}

It's got the exact right amount of tables and couches. It's a great place to study - I've never had problems finding a study table. The tables are large enough, too - not like those dinky coffee tables where you could barely fit a book. There are different size tables for individuals and pairs or for groups. \n\nThe staff are friendly and accommodating.

This is a great location in the Philz empire.  Fast, friendly staff, open space, lots of comfy seating, and a reasonable number of outlets.  The line was long, but they processed us really quickly.  I think it was ~10 minutes between getting in line and getting my drink, which was made to the usual high standards I've come to expect from Philz.  Mint Mojito Iced, you're everything I want a mixed coffee drink to be.\n\nThe vibe is suprisingly laid back given that UC San Francisco's Hastings College of Law is around the corner.  Lots of would be lawyers studying, along with some VERY attractive and flirty locals.  I'm not the kind of guy who picks up girls in coffee places.  But, the ones I ran into at the Civic Center Philz were all very friendly/chatty.  Not typical of the average San Francisco coffee shop.\n\nParking was surprisingly good.  We managed to score a spot half a block down Golden Gate.  However, it was by a college during summer on a Sunday afternoon.  I imagine Monday morning in the fall, the situation is entirely different.  Then again, I don't usually recommend driving anywhere in the city.  The Civic Center BART stop is pretty close, along with several other mass transit options.  The area can be a little sketch at night, but I've never been worried during the day.\n\nThrough a strange confluence of events, I ended up with TWO large Mint Mojito Iced Coffees and no takers for the extra.

I was charged nearly 4 dollars for a cup of coffee and it took a year and a day to prepare. I stopped going in there and went elsewhere for my coffee. So, I had not been into Philz for years until recently. \n\nLast week, a friend who works downtown wanted to meet up for coffee and told me \"There's a Philz across the street.\" I began to narrow my eyes, but since this was across from her office and convenient for her, I said \"Okay.\" So I go in to meet my friend. While we were there, lots of cops and firemen came through. So if you want to hit on a cop or fireman, this is probably a good place to hang out.\n\nI get in line to order my coffee and there are two people behind me also waiting. While I'm standing there waiting, where the girl at the counter can clearly see me and the others behind me, the girl has a conversation with a fireman. Seriously. I don't mean she was talking about what coffee he wanted--she was just chatting away with him, while other people waited. I really couldn't believe it--who does this? She just went on and on and on. Finally, she stopped talking and I was able to place my order. \n\nThe woman wanted to know which coffee I wanted. \"Which one has the most caffeine?\" I asked. I ordered that one. $3 for a small coffee and $3.25 for tea for my friend. THREE DOLLARS. FOR A SMALL CUP OF COFFEE. Three dollars and change for a cup of tea. The place near my house gives me a medium cup for $1.65 and they are really nice people to boot. \n\nSo I went back to my friend  and waited. And waited. And lo, when we had waited for many eons, someone served up the tea and coffee. I picked it up and went to the cash register and waited to pay. There was no one there at the cash register, so I just stood there like an idiot. Eventually I figured I'd pay later and took the coffee and tea over to my table. My friend and I talked for more than an hour. \n\nWhen it was time for me to go, I went over to the cash register (where there was still no one) and waited for someone to show up. Finally, I thought \"This is ridiculous\" and left. \n\nSo, to sum up: Philz is overpriced and pretentious. But if you have time to kill and don't care how much something costs, you should go here.

But today something unusual happened and I was embarrassed for being nice to cashier girl named STEPH. I complimented her plaid shirt , got my coffee and was chatting with my friend about important stuff. The coffee here is super good, and always fresh. As we were talking suddenly the lady and her manager comes in by asks us to leave the place coz Cashier didn't like my compliment and she felt uncomfortable.  Such a low self esteem girl working in such a great coffee place. The manager should have handled the situation professionally but instead she harassed us in front of all customers. Shame that such a great coffee place has shitty manager. We had no choice but leave the cafe with our coffee in out hands. Never going that store.", "author": "Krishna L."}

I am I'm that class of person who probably deserves an intervention (\"I had no idea how my additions were damaging my relationships...\" [insert crocodile tears here]). So today when a friend suggested that I have a coffee at Philz while I waited for her, I had zero expectations since most coffee is well within one standard deviation of the mean; not too bad and not too good. \n\nSuffice to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I chose a small \"New Manhattan.\"  It was extremely flavorful, and served at a good temperature: cool enough to enjoy immediately but hot enough to last and make you savor the taste, lest you burn your tongue.\"\n\nThe place was packed, so I asked a gent if I could share his table, and he gladly obliged. \n\nAs a side note, a bunch of police officers showed up for some tasty beverages. I always see this as an important data point since they are in that class of professional that, due to the nature of the job, need to dine out often. Therefore, they are pretty good at identifying places that do not provide value for the money. Plus the were a genial lot, and I rarely say that about \"The Man.\"\n\nI only wish they had more baked goods and whatnot. I was there late in the day, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but a piece of cake would have made the perfect companion to the delicious brew. Just sayin'.", "author": "Stephen G."}

People would go ape sh*t over this place. The baristas were so nice and accommodating. They continuously apologized for the wait and thanked the customers for being so patient. I didn't mind waiting for my coffee because I knew it was fresh and I understand drip coffee takes time. They were also nice enough to adjust the sweetness of my drink!

Off I went with my map and a stern warning about the Tenderloin area. I'm not afraid of much but on my walk I encounter a man defecating on the sidewalk, a few guys nodding out up against a building (one with the needle still in his arm), and several let's say, \"spirited\" requests for a donation....

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-06", "description": "Now before I start on this path of what may appear to be total foolishness, I have to preclude what I am  about to say with some facts. Fact 1: There is something in Philz coffee that makes me smarter. I don't mean like I take a sip and I'm more alert and awake. I literally mean, I take a sip and I make Stephen Hawking look like Giligan from Giligans island. I used to drink Starbucks coffee and would have a stomach ache 5 minutes later. After taking a few sips of Philz, I'm probably the smartest person alive.  Fact 2: I think I know that the people working in the Philz coffee truck know that their coffee makes people smarter, but they don't know that I know that they know theres some weird coffee voodoo going on here. Is there a witch doctor sacrificing chickens and reading dice made out of bones sitting in the back of the truck invoking spirits into the coffee? The Philz staff all have this weird grin on their face. I don't need to know how you do it. Just know that I KNOW that what your doing is probably not legal in most countries. Fact 3: As I have been writing this, I have just thought of 3 ways how to raise a million dollars in about a week. I could tell all you pretty easilly but I'm sure you're not interested. My Mocha Tesora is cold now, but it's power is still running strong. I've found that if I drink a cup at around 9:30 AM, my mind starts to return to it's previous non-genius state at around 2pm. The flow chart I'm working on right now is goddamm amazing. I've never used Visio in my life. Final Fact: I dropped my chocolate chip  and walnut cookie yesterday waiting for my coffee yesterday.

I have a sweet tooth and like to order a Jacob's Wonderbar or Philtered Soul with medium cream and sugar when I want hot coffee, or the mint mojito or ecstatic iced coffee when I want something colder.  If it's your first time, then ask the barista; the baristas know their coffee and are great at recommending drinks, and if they don't make it right, they're fast at fixing it.  Also, if you bring your own mug, you get a large coffee for the price of a small, which is $3 at this location.\n\nWarning: Philz is great at keeping the hobos and crazies out of the store, but this store is not located in a very safe neighborhood so don't leave anything in your car and know your surroundings.", "author": "M.

Sometimes I'm able to get a chia sometimes I couldn't. This location is a block away from my apt and very convenient. So one day I'm Working on my laptop job searching doing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stuff listening to my music when The manager walks right up to me and gets in my face about how I need to buy something. Never mind the crazy homeless that come in and use the bathroom. This location has signs about the bathroom use but NOTHING about free WiFi is just for customers inside the store. It's not even posted on their FB page when you login. Also let me point out that that the network can be easily accessed outside the building. You don't even have to be inside the building. I emailed their corporate office about the incident. It was very upsetting and I almost started to cry but held back my tears. She was so mean about it. I told her to hold on that I'm in the middle of something that I need to complete but she was insistent that I but something NOW. OK fine I told her just give me a second. I dug through my backpack and found a couple of dollars. Not much but I bought an odawalla. I have since been working so I'm able to buy a chia to use their internet if I have to. The one star is for the Mean Manager the location is great. You are there to sell coffee not monitor whose using the internet focus on that.
