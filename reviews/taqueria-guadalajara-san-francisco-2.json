We ordered some Tripas, Pastor, Lengua, and Cabeza to share - and I obviously grabbed a Modelo Negra to wash it all down. \n\nThe food is very affordable and served quickly after you place an order, and there is a variety of selections that you wouldn't easily find in NY taquerias. (That being said, if you are into special cuts of meat, I would highly recommend trying out their Tripas!) Also, dare I mention there is an open salsa bar with excellent condiments to go along with your food?\n\nI can happily say every single bite was excellent and succulent, and I am excited to return to Taqueria Guadalajara for my Mexican fix in the near future.", "author": "Ji-Sub J."}

Or it can even be at your local beach if you've never been there. I'm not much into surfing, but the only way I can describe this burrito is a fresh killer wave bursting with flavor. The shrimp provides your mouth with a sweet and savory aroma, while the perfect combination of garlic, butter, bell peppers, and rice compliment the shrimp in perfect harmony. It is like riding a big wave and experiencing that high when you hit the big one. Now the orange habanero sauce is to die for. If you aren't into spicy I would just recommend a tiny bit, because IT IS HOT. The habanero sauce provides that twist of citrus and spicy pepper flavor that hits you like a coming hurricane at the beach. Your mouth will be exploding with so many flavors the shrimp will magically come to life and dance around you in a summer blowout. Kumbaya my lord all day.\n\nThey give you a very generous portion of shrimp, and it's always perfectly cooked so it's just the right amount of chew and snap. The price is a bit high ($13.10 advertised and $14+ with tax), but that's for the super which comes with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. If you're not a fan of avocado you can get the regular, but if you want to dive into the habanero sauce I would recommend, because the avocado gives a nice creamy balance to the hot citrusy explosion of the shrimp+ sauce combo.\n\nThis place is definitely my go to spot for shrimp burritos, and I will be returning.", "author": "Galen L."}

All were really good. But the chorizo stuck out well above the others. And even though it would typically be favorite of mine, the steak was my least favorite. But you could tell the ingredients in each were fresh and delicious. I also had a bite of my dinner companions beef tongue. Something I have had before... but not often.

I finally walked in on .Tiff's glowing recommendation and was not disappointed.  Hell, I woofed my meal down like it was the last Mexican dish I'd ever eat.\n\nI strongly recommend hitting the Super Tacos here if you like a generous serving of avocado.  They prepare the deep fried pork in an unusually delicious way: you'll find crispy thin strips almost like Vaca Frita.  The burritos are also obscenely substantial but my pollo asado configuration wasn't exactly a signature taste.  Quite forgettable, really.\n\nStill, overall I felt that the ingredients were better and preparation were dealt with more care than the more popular bulk-serving other taquerias nearby that often serve you wet, runny meat and beans.  It felt like the menu has some gems, and their kitchen is fun to watch.  Quality at a good price: three can eat for about $20 combined.  Quite a bargain!  I'm eager to return and experiment further.\n\nThe hand-carved branded seats and tables and wall-to-wall pueblo paitings are complete with faux wooden doors and awnings are charming, but the charm is quickly lost to the blasting soccer games on bolted-on televisions at full blast.  Unless you care for the sport you should consider taking your food to go and eat it 3 blocks up in beautiful Folsom Park or (if lazy) steal a Phil'z Coffee park bench and enjoy some hipster people watching from the corner.\n\nPro tip:  Try the melon juice.

It is basically a big bowl of beef or pork (your choice of meat) and Latin American corn (the big non-sweet kernal kind) stewed in a rich tomato beef broth.\n- They accept credit card here (rare for the Mission) and there is no minimum so I can conserve my cash for other places in the neighborhood.\n- Relatively clean and spacious place for being a non-gringo spot.\n\nJUST OKAY:\n- The POLLO ASADO and the CARNE ASADA BURRITOS were okay. They were not as flavorful and good as the CARNITAS. The carne asada tended to be a bit on the dry side too.\n\nBAD:\n- None.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n- I would give this place 4.5 stars just for the carnitas burrito but the pollo asado and carne asada were just average.

I'm glad I only ordered 2 tacos - they were huge. The tortillas were loaded beyond capacity, and I'm glad I was able to finish them off before they completely disintegrated from the grease and juice and all. Pastor had plenty of deliciously crunchy bits with a couple pieces of fat (the bad for you but good for flavor type) mixed in for good measure. Tried the lengua and was expecting a bit more flavor, wasn't really enough to make me go ooh yum. Could've done without the cheese but I enjoyed the avocado. Oh, and there is such a thing as too much sour cream, though I still ate it all up.\n\nI left full, happy, and bordering on food coma. I was healed, yippee!", "author": "Mike W."}

Guadalajara's burrito made me over indulge. \n\nIt was cold and gray outside, so I used their hot to the core super burrito for $6.50 to warm me from the inside out. The super picante habenero salsa helped with the warming too, leaving my lips burning for about 15 minutes afterward.\n\nThe pastor was a little too fatty for me, way fatty actually.

My man's carnitas were better, with a nice smoky char and crispy bits. \n\nI love sour cream and they gave me so much I feel guilty the next day. As it should be.

But it referred to the ingredient mix as \"flummoxing.\"  It appears that the highly-skilled burrito technicians at TG have learned something in the interim.  This is a 4.5-star taqueria.  [See UPDATE 7/14/07 - five stars, plus].\n\nMy super burrito with black beans was huge, well-grilled, and had a very well balanced mix of ingredients, including plentiful slices of avocado.  There was no shortage of melted cheese, but the pico made a cameo appearance only in selected bites.   Minus half a star.\n\nRice usually doesn't win any flavor contests with me, but it held its own here.  All of the ingredients tasted very fresh.\n\nThis was my 2nd visit.  I ordered al pastor on my first, which was kind of bland and disappointing, so I subtracted half a star.  But I'll definitely return to try other meats.  One of these weekends I'll try their birria.\n\nThe only real downside to visit no. 2 was that I hate seeing good food go to waste.  My burrito was merely massive, and I barely finished it.  My friend (who ordered the same burrito as I did) got a gi-normous stomach distender that went a little unfinished.  \n\nThis place is very clean, including the kitchen and bathroom.  That's worth at least a bonus half-star.\n\nUPDATE 7/14/07: my \"mixto\" burrito with carnitas and al pastor broke the meter, blasting past 5 stars.  Wow.  The huge foil cylinder was so hot, I had to wait a few minutes before I could even pick it up.  I unwrapped a perfectly-grilled tortilla with a wall of cheese and a textbook ingredient mix.  \n\nEven the salsa was great -- the not-to-be-toyed with mango-habanero made a cameo appearance, and the pico was spicy, flavorful, and well-balanced.  Grilled onions and huge chunks of avocado rounded out the veggie contingent.  \n\nStellar in every way.  Stel-lar.", "author": "Steve K."}

Guadalajara was the first taqueria in my path, so I went in. I loved the weird 70s-basement-meets-50s-western-saloon-movie decor.

The crappy pizza joint has been nicely remodeled into a taqueria. By nice I mean it's a step up from El Farolito, El Tona, etc. Somewhere along the lines of a La Taqueria, Pancho Villa  - meaning you can sit at a table in a fairly clean enviroment (with hand painted murals and chairs with the name branded into the leather backs) and have some good Mex. I don't know if it's associated with the other Guadalajara but I'll check next time I'm there and report back. So what's the point? Along the 24th Street Corridor this is a nice addition to go along with the renovated Roosevelt Tamale Parlor - a nicer taqueria (decor wise) with solid food. Beer/wine license is in the work and if they (could) served margaritas, they'd get another star.", "author": "Sig N."}

Their salsa bar had two choices I really enjoyed, a red and a green.  They were grinding up fresh lime while I was there for the salsas so you know it's good stuff.  When the tacos arrived at my table, I almost gasped and the generous slices of high-quality avocado in each small taco.  Red hot salsa was nice in the tacos.  With the included chips, this 2 taco lunch with water was more than enough to fill me up and was extremely satisfying for $6.50 after tax.  I liked it a bit more than my other favorite across the street, Tonayense , which is also very nice, but this spot it a bit better.  Nicer ambiance and a bit cleaner.  Cool, comfortable chairs.  I contend that the key to finding a good restaurant is to get off the main streets because these places have to be outstanding to survive off the tourist / clubbing tracts.", "author": "Marc S."}

Clean bathrooms. Nice ambiance. Sweet murals. Good service.\nThe Bad: I was very  hungry and I couldn't 't eat more than a couple of bites of that horrendous Burrito. Can be problematic outside, in front of the place, I once saw a beer bottle thrown at lady near me by an unknown drunk late one evening,. She was scared and  traumatized. Poor woman.  The Neighborhood.\n\nExperience: Tonight at midnight, I was quite hungry, and went to  Taqueria Guadalajara, were I Bought a carne asada Burrito and a Torta Sandwich for $14.84. The service was fine, the salsa bar was good. I took the food home and saw that the $7.50 (+ Tax) Burrito was quite thin, even so I enthusiastically bit into my skinny burrito.  Not a good experience. The meat portion was miniscule and the meat itself was rubbery, grisly and excessively SALTY. I was basically served a bean, salt and cilantro  Burrito. The Burrito was so salty and had so much cilantro, that although I was very hungry I was unable to eat it. My friend gave me part of his Torta Sandwich and although better than the burrito, it hardly had any cheese, the sandwich was not cut in half, and the same overly salty, grisly, precooked, rubbery meat was used. Taqueria El Farolito down the street, charges $1.50 less,  $13.23 for a Super Burrito and a Torta, and their Burritos are twice the size of the anorexic  one I received at Taqueria Guadalajara, and the torta sandwiches are so much better, the Tortas sandwiches at EL Farolito are made with a couple of fresh cooked steaks, not with precooked, grisly, rubbery and salty chopped meat.\nAs for that burrito, I had to throw it away. I have been eating Burritos in the Mission district for 35+ years, and this is the first time I had to throw the food away in quite some years.  I have eaten here before and I  like their habanero salsa.  Their longtime cook Miguel is gone an so has the quality of the food of this taqueria.\nConclusion:  although the service, the salsas and the ambiance were good, presently the food portion is miserly and tastes awful. I like salt, I like cilantro, but their food had way to much of both drowning out all but the salsa and compared to the other Taquerias on 24th street , way too little in the meat department. As of this 2012 writing I plan to eat elsewhere. I was hungry and I had to throw my carne asada burrito away. Cannot recommend.", "author": "Charlie T."}

There are no real surprises here, just standard taqueria-style food done better than anybody else.  The beans are great and flavorful and not overcooked.  The meats are all well-seasoned and cooked properly.  The service is quick and attentive.  The setting...leaves something to be desired, but it's a taqueria after all.  The aguas frescas are in general a bit disappointing, but they usually are at most taquerias.  Another plus is that the food is quite consistent.  It's also nice that they accept cards, or I might visit Tonayense across the street a little more often as they are different, and sometimes I'm just in the mood for Tonayense.  \n\nIt is far more pleasant than the cafeteria-room feel of Pancho Villa or the insanity of La Taqueria or the homeless passing-through Taqueria Can-Cun.  I still prefer Guadalajara's food even though I would rate them all at about three stars.  They are all different, but ultimately, not that different.  The slight edge on the food and the habanero salsa (insanely hot, perfect for my masochistic taste), keep me coming back here over all the rest.", "author": "Chris F."}
