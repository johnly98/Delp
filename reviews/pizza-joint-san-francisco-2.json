I recommend building your own with a limited amount of toppings, usually I do 2-3 toppings and the pizza is consistent, anything pass that and it can become soggy. The wings are not Buffalo but more like fried with good flavor, make sure to eat all the wings on the first day as reheating the wings in the oven truly dry them out, reheating the pizza in the oven after a day or so in the fridge is still fantastic. \n\nOverall the delivery has been on time and polite.

The pesto had great flavor.\n\n*Slice of Cheese pizza ($3.50), add Baby clams ($0.50), Fresh garlic ($0.50)\nThis was good because of the garlic. The clams really are small, so you don't get the same texture and flavor as with normal sized clams.\n\n*Slice of Cheese pizza ($3.50), add Fresh basil ($0.50)\nDon't add basil. This was definitely a waste of $0.50. There was barely any basil on the slice.\n\n*Slice of Pepperoni pizza ($4), add Sausage ($0.50), Mushrooms ($0.50)\nI typically love meat pizzas with mushrooms. But this wasn't very good. The meats didn't have much flavor.\n\nThe crust here is thick, so be prepared. I didn't care for the thickness since I prefer thinner crust pizzas. I threw away about 1/3 of the whole crust per slice because it was so bready!\n\nDelivery was quick, but I live two blocks down, so that was expected. There is a $20 minimum which is why I ended up with four slices instead of three. In the end, this satisfied my pizza craving, but I've had better. I may order from them again if I want slices and I don't want to wait. Or maybe I'll forgo the $20 min and walk my lazy butt there!", "author": "Elena N."}

I also loved their meatball sandwich.

When we first walked in, the cashier who told us later that he was the owner's son, didn't greet us. I said hi to him first. Anyway, we also asked him a few questions about the menu. Meatball sandwiches are not served with homemade meatballs sadly. So we ordered a pizza instead. We sat down, tables were sticky so I went to get some napkins and told the cashier that the tables were sticky. He stood there and stared at me so I said \"i have some napkins can you wet them so I can wipe down the table...it's sticky\" and he's like \"oh you want me to wet them?\" And I said \"well do you have a rag to wipe it down?\" And he's said \"oh yeah.\" It's like okay...not rocket science but I went back to the table and he came over to wipe it down. He also didnt restock anything in the front...we saw him standing there the whole time. We needed knives and he handed one to me but said \"theyre usually in the container with the forks.\" But he didn't restock them after I walked away. waited about 25-30 for our pizza to arrive to the table. This is more of a take out spot even though they have tables to sit down at. Drinks were bottled only, no cups with ice, plastic ware only, sat down with the pizza box and paper plates in front of us. The pizza was rather doughy, leaving the crust very thick. The ground beef looked more like sausage. They left a bottle of ranch on the table for us to help ourselves and when we left we asked for a sauce container for the .50 ranch we paid for and the cashier gave us a container and we had to ask him again for a lid..... probably not coming back anytime soon or again..disappointing experience!", "author": "Jane S."}

They sell by the slice, but little did we know that EACH slice was probably equivalent to the size of a personal pizza. SLICES BIGGER THAN MY FACE. Seriously. \n\nTasty pizza, but downside was we didn't realize that 4 slices would cost us more than a small pizza! $18 something for 4 slices. Now, that may sound ridiculous, but honestly because of the size and the fact that we didn't just get plain cheese slices, I felt that it was worth it. I couldn't even finish my slices. They didn't have the thin crust style kind of crust--more of the thick crust, bready, yet still crunchy kind. I personally liked it and would go back, but maybe just for 1 slice at a time. Haha. The guys behind the counter were nice and the decor of the place was cute. They have sandwiches too! The names of the pizzas and the sandwiches are fun as well.

And I don't know about you but I like to dip my pizza in ranch and to me ranch sitting out on the counter all day is not sanitary. So my recommendation is to order your delicious pizza and have it delivered or pick it up.", "author": "Victoria Y."}

This place is so much more than a pizza joint though. They offer a wide selection at their deli-style counter, including chicken teriyaki, macaroni salad, fruit cups, and treats. They are so nice here too, I think the owner was in when I came by and he was really friendly and sweet. They also are a little mini-mart with a wall full up of their candy selection.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-05-08", "description": "I honestly want to give this place a better rating because the food is actually pretty good, which is why I've had a few weird experiences with them but have continued to go back. After tonight though, I think I've been pushed over the edge and will never order from them again. Their treatment of customers, even frequent customers like myself (I live right around the corner), is strange and pretty rude that I don't want to give them my business at all. \n\n1) They have an extensive sandwich menu written on the wall that extends across half of one side of the place. Nowhere on this menu or anywhere in the entire place does it say that sandwiches are only served during certain hours (which I don't think is actually the case?). But walking in the other night excited for a Pizza Joint sub, I was met with two employees with their backs turned from the door doing nothing except chatting. They didn't even greet me and my boyfriend. But as our eyes turned to the ENORMOUS portion of their menu listing the sandwiches, they immediately said \"No sandwiches. All the stuff is put away.\" This was at 9pm and they close at 10pm... Like I understand that it's *almost* closing time, but an hour before? Give me a break. Why should more than half their menu already be put away? It was very weird and their hostile attitude was annoying. If that's how it is every night as well, they should clarify that on the menu...\n\n2) On their website, they advertise 2 medium 2 topping pizzas for $18. They have an extensive topping selection which is a huge part of their appeal for me. But a lot of the topping are labeled with as asterisk (*) and explained as being priced as 2 toppings instead of 1. A lot of their stuff is labeled as such, and I get why so it usually doesn't bother me. But thinking that I could order one of the toppings priced as 2 and another and just pay extra, I called to do so. Nowhere on the coupon does it explain that this can't be done and that there are \"no exceptions.\" If the rules of using this coupon were explained in fine print, I wouldn't complain. But the guy told me he \"literally couldn't do that\" when I asked to get both pineapple and shrimp on my pizza because shrimp counts as 2 toppings on their menu. I told him I was willing to pay whatever extra charge because that's the pizza I wanted. But no he \"just couldn't do that.\" So they lost out on business from me because they couldn't charge me extra? Very weird, and I didn't appreciate the way he talked to me especially since technically the pizza DID have only 2 toppings on it, and I was very willing to pay an extra charge.\n\nThey won't be getting my business again, regardless of the good food. There's a way to treat customers properly and they never succeed at it.", "author": "Courtney W."}

OK, so maybe they run out over a weekend, but that's still kind of poor planning.\n\nAnyway, the pizza was promised in 40 - 45 minutes, but actually arrived in about 30.\n\nVery tasty mushroom pizza.  I'll agree with another review that it was a bit wet.  The hand-tossed crust was pretty thin in the middle, though generous around the edge.  Either the sauce or mushroom juice or both had made the center soggy.  But other than that, the pizza was excellent.  I'm looking forward to reheating leftovers in the oven, perhaps crisping up the center of the crust a little bit.\n\nThe cheese was generous, but didn't quite reach the crust on the edge (some bare tomato sauce was visible around most of the edge).  This meant that the cheese would slide off the slice while eating from the center.\n\nMinus 1 star for:  soggy middle of the pie. not spreading the cheese beyond the sauce to anchor it, toppings out of stock, low enthusiasm on the phone & no web page (so I could be sure I was looking at a current menu).\n\nEven so, this was quite tasty.  I'll order again.", "author": "Jon L."}

Everything is delicious.  My only problem is the fact that they told us they would deliver in 45 to 60 minutes, and it took about 90 minutes.  Still hot when it got here, though.  Overall, a good experience.", "author": "M A."}

What an absolute waste of money.  This pizza even smelled bad.  I would rather eat dirt than one single bite of the pizza from this joint.", "author": "Cheryl F."}

I was hungry for Pizza and had no idea where to go. When I yelped \"pizza\" for my area (Outer Richmond)  Pizza Joint came up and I started to read the reviews. My buddy NICK T gave it a great review so I thought I would give it a try. I ordered a Large #1 (Supreme Pizza)  and had it delivered.  The delivery was on time (40 min) and the pizza was AMAZING.  I have to say I have had many pizza's in my time,  but this Supreme Pizza was Superb! The beast pizza I have ever had. All the topping were fresh and there were many of them.  It is a bit pricy (22.00)  but WELL WORTH IT!!  I will definitely be getting my pizza here from now on. LOVE IT!  Welcome to the city!!", "author": "Brad B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-05", "description": "I really like their pizza, have ordered it 3 times to pick up.  It's hot, fresh, chewy cheese, an authentic NY pizza.  Crust was just about right, not too thick.  I use their $10.99 coupon for a large plain cheese, but its also good for a large pepperoni.  Excellent!  Not the best I have ever had but right up there.  The cheese is a bit on the salty side.  I don't like salt... it's something people should be allowed to add on their own, like pepper, and I wish restaurants would remember that.  Salt is not a healthy thing. Pizza is unhealthy enough with all that saturated fat... but it's my weakness and this is as good as any in the city.  Excellent overall and for $10.99, can't be beat.", "author": "martin c."}
