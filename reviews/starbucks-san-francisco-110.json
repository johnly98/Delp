My usual Starbucks didn't have the breakfast sandwich I wanted, so I decided to stop by this one. (I did mobile ordering, so I found out before I left that this location had my sandwich.) I stopped by on Thursday, April 19th around 10am.\n\nI get a lot of Starbucks gift cards at work, so they come in handy when I need breakfast. I normally get the Sausage, Cheddar & Egg Breakfast Sandwich: A Southern-style sausage patty, fluffy eggs and aged Cheddar cheese are served on a toasty English muffin ($3.75). Similar to a sandwich I adore at a restaurant with some golden arches, I've found this satisfies my breakfast craving. And since I have a Starbucks balance, they are free! Yay for that! Though normally, the sandwich is rather misshapen as I think they just throw the sandwich into their bag after toasting. It's more or less always lopsided.\n\nThis location is close to Moscone, so if there's a convention, it does get rather busy. There is another Starsbucks directly across the street on Mission right by the Target, so if this one is crazy, you have another option close by. Since I did mobile ordering, I didn't even have to interact with anyone. I went to the mobile ordering area, found my breakfast sandwich, and then left.\n\nDecent location.

It's big, there's ample seating, and it's clean.  This last time though, made me want to walk a little farther for another Starbucks...\n\nWe were on our way to a weeknight movie at Century, and because we're old, my girlfriend needed a little pick me up so she could stay awake and enjoy the movie.  We ordered using mobile order as soon as we closed our door.  We got to starbucks in probably less than 10 minutes, and our drinks were waiting.  She ordered a hot drink with coconut milk, and I ordered an iced coffee.  On the bar waiting for us was 2 iced drinks.  She was ready to walk out and not ask for a hot drink, but it was a cold night.  I asked them to make the drink hot like she had ordered and the guy apologized (probably the manager), and asked this other guy to make the drink.  The other guy argued that we ordered an iced drink, and the first guy told him to \"read the label\".  Also, the drink was made with regular coffee (we ordered decaf), because the manager explained that it \"was supposed to be decaf too.\"  We were a little concerned at this point, so we watched him make the drink. He didn't use coconut milk, we watched him pour regular milk into the drink, and I don't think he made the latte \"vanilla bean\" as per our order.  When I asked for clarification when he handed the drink to me, I was met with the rudest response, that may as well have been an F you.  He said, \"yep\", and went back to making drinks.  \n\nIt's a shame the service here is so terrible because of the positive atmosphere I mentioned above.  Don't trust these baristas to make your drink accurately.  Clearly the manager needs to train his staff.", "author": "Ashley S."}

It's also centrally located, near the Westfield mall, AMC, and adjacent to Target. However, when I visiting this location last night, I was disappointed in how unkept and unclean the store was - the tables were either extremely rickety or really dirty to sit at, even though there were seats available, many customers opted to stand and talk instead. Additionally, some of the customers were openly rude to others, and were disruptive to the general atmosphere that eventually I felt uncomfortable enough to leave, which I have never had to do at a Starbucks before. The last negative point was that there was no specific Starbucks wifi, only Target, but it was free so that didn't make a huge impact. The only reason this review is 2 stars instead of 1 is that service was prompt and cheerful, I felt like the baristas did a good job.

The service here is prompt, facility is clean, spacious and importantly; friendly team members. I was originally expecting to see a long line here since the next building is Moscone Center. This is partly because conference/lecture sessions, trade shows and auto shows take place at Moscone Center around this time of the year. From this point, it would be very obvious for event attendees to come in for their coffee break. Anyways, the line wasn't super when I came in today.

Sorry Starbucks. The little table with milk and 1/2&1/2 is in terrible conditions. Nobody seems to care.\n\nThird day: I don't think there will ever be a third day.", "author": "Frank F."}

Some are really nice and some are less than helpful.  I witnessed one cashier telling a customer who was already irritated with his service that \"business is business\" and that she has to pay the extra 20 cents for the green tea latte that she thought she ordered originally even though they made her a grande latte.  I got pretty angry at a cashier who refused to give me the change in cash for my starbucks card, even though there was a sign right in front of the register that they are required by law to do so.  \n\nIt's a great location, for me and a lot of others, but it's not usually crowded.  It all depends on the conference schedule.", "author": "Amy D."}

BUT.. after parking in the garage and heading towards the Metreon for a movie, we had about an hour to waste and decided \"lets get some coffee.\"\n\nSo this Starbucks is literally built right into the garage.. There was a side door that actually let's you IN right from exiting the garage.\n\nAnyway, everyone here was super friendly, didn't laugh or give me weird looks for my weird coffee request, and my drink was seriously done in less than a minute. It's a big spot, there's more than one stand to get your straws/sugar/napkins etc. and surprisingly.. NO homeless people at all wandering around inside! Weird, considering the neighborhood. \n\nMy drink was fine, not oversugary or SOUR like a lot of starbucks (why i hate them so much) and we could actually sit down at a CLEAN table for once.THEN I was able to come back later with that $2 iced drink after 2pm deal which was a good bargain.

The manager Pete (if that's his real name) is a bad example to his employees and needs to go back to customer service training. He was rude and demeaning then played dumb when I called him on it.  On on his employees apologized for his behavior instead of himself.", "author": "Jewel A."}

Starbucks is wearing on me a little bit and that was only confirmed by the drink that I got from here.  I ordered my usual, a skinny vanilla latte, which tasted less like coffee and more like a chemically sugary sweet.  My fault for ordering this beverage, although they didn't use to taste so odd.  Other than that, it is a fine place to sit for a bit and have some kinda acrid tasting caffeine!", "author": "Prettylilredhead H."}

So when you see all corporate america coming here from Moscone Center, THEY ARE NOT PAYING FOR IT OUT OF POCKET. They are having this come out of their company's pocket as \"a necessity\". Imagine 4.50 for a triple venti mocha, no foam hazelnut latte and a scone will run you about 7.00.  \n\nLets examine starbucks carefully and what a waste to their stockholders this is. \n\n#1, there is a starbucks on every block, there is one on 5th street, a few on market street, 2 on 4th street (this one and IN the metreon), in powell bart station. \n\n#2, think of the overhead (rent, employees (30k per employee plus stock options and benefits)\n\n#3, the specialized coffee prices. Expensive. \n(Go to Target and buy a latte machine, yikes)\n\nIf Starbucks was smart, they would eliminate all the \"excessive\" store locations. I guess that's why they finally wised up in this unstable economy and are closing alot of their stores. And lets face it, the powell street starbucks is a waste of breath...if you say you open at 5am and put a sign on your door on a daily basis that says \"We'll be open at 5:20, but you're really going to show up at 5:45, then guess how much business you've lost.", "author": "Charlene C."}

I asked for the code to the restroom and the Barista tells me you have to be a customer to use the restroom.. Then I tell her I am a customer and she unhappily tells me the code. I tried the code and it dint work.. I went back to her and repeated the code and she confirmed that it is indeed the code..She had an extremely stony expression on her face and it felt like she was doing me a huge favor.. I tried it again and it dint work.. Finally i went to another Barista and found out that the code I was told was incorrect..

I usually order a grande green tea soy latte extra hot with no melon.  The reason I do this is simply because i like and i can.  For a while, I was so addicted to it that I had to have one everyday.  And, what makes this Starbucks better than the others is the friendly staff.  They KNOW what i order and even suggest that I get it without the syrup if I don't want it too sweet.  Oh, by the way, I also like green tea light frappucino with coffee base (instead of cream base).  Despite the weird greenish brown color, the flavor of matcha and coffee blend surprisingly well, and the double caffeine definitely makes you very VERY happy.", "author": "Vivian H."}
