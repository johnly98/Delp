It's located right on Geary in between 2nd and 3rd ave so it's pretty easy to get to -- parking isn't always the greatest but people who ordered their pizzas to-go double parked in front of the restaurant at the bus stop and were able to run in and out with their pizzas without a problem. If you don't have a car that's not a problem either -- as stated before there's a bus stop right in front so if you hop on the 38 it'll bring you right to where you need to be. \n\nThe restaurant is really tiny and not to prettiest, but it's interior does not affect the quality of the pizza in any way. My favorite pizza to get there is pepperoni with pesto. It's not on the menu but you just order it and they can make it for you; it comes out to $4.50 per slice and one slice is decent sized. It may not be as large as a costco slice or anything like that but one slice is good enough for those late night munchies. \n\nI personally think Nizario's pizzas are really tasty but I find them to be on the heavier side -- both with the pizza crust/toppings and the oil it comes with. My pizza in particular may be more oily because it is topped with pesto, but in general I always have to dab a few napkins on the top to get rid of that upper layer of oil. One slice is incredibly filling and right after you finish your pizza, if you're craving some sweet stuff there's a boba place right next door. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because of the price and the cleanliness/size of the restaurant itself. Since my pizza is technically not on the menu, it's always a tad bit more expensive than whatever else my friends to get that is on the menu. In regards to space, sometimes the later you go the more crowded it is, especially on weekends, and since the interior is so tiny it only has 2 round tables and a bar -- maybe 10 high chairs max. My group of friends was quite large so only 4 of us got seats while the rest crowded around. Eating in may not be the best option for large groups! Overall, I enjoy the pizza from Nizario's and I will continue to come back for those munchies/drunchies.", "author": "Danielle S."}

The ratios were 30% bone, 50% squishy slimy fat, and 20% meat, which I'd attribute to them not using a proper fat-rendering cooking method prior to baking.

That dream was somewhat fleeting though.\n\nThe place is tiny, standing room only with tables to boot but people really go in just to grab a slice n go, or stand and eat before piling into the car again. The service at the front is curt and to the point. For this type of business it works perfectly unless you want to be catered to. I wouldn't see why though considering you're probably there for the same reason that I am at this hour; attempting to avoid waking up drunk in the morning.\n\nThe pizza itself was not my cup of tea. Well, it wasn't terrible but made me wish I could find a Blondie's nearby instead. I got a super combo and a chicken pesto. It wasn't anything amazing per se. The crust was crunchy which was nifty since it held up well. Drunk proof practically in my mind. Knowing me if it was a sloppy affair I'd drop so much stuff off of it during my meal. The toppings were okay with not much sauce to speak of. I didn't get a feel for the taste of the ingredients which was kind of a let down. Usually everything tastes delish after a long night playing the lush, but I couldn't really say that here. I'd say it was probably because the pizza was dry unfortunately which would explain a lot about what I had experienced from it. Should've stuck with a classic pepperoni or mushroom had I known. I tried a sauce on the side thinking it was a spicy sauce and would save the pizza a bit. To my dismay it was buffalo instead.

Granted, it's not the best pizza I've ever had in my life...but the fact that they are open until 2am, always get their pizzas ready within their time frame (I think it's 30-45 minutes) and have always been consistent, I can't complain! \n\nThe pizza parlor itself has only about 4 or 5 small bar like tables to sit at so most people grab a slice and chill outside, especially those just getting out of the bars around 1:30am. \n\nThe crust is a good thickness and the prices aren't bad. I've never paid more than $18-20 for a large pizza. They also offer single slices if you eat in. \n\nThe staff is always nice and have never made any mistakes with my credit card or order like other places I've been to more than once.", "author": "Ashley M."}

Dough, cheese, sauce, toppings.\n\nThe dough was awesome on both slices. Very light, yet toasty. I think toasty is a very good description of it. Not crunchy, but toasty.\n\nThe cheese is great. Do you know how to tell good cheese from bad cheese? Oil and if it falls off your pizza. A good one will not be oily and it will no fall off your pizza. Nizario's is a good one.\n\nTomato sauce was good too. Not tangy and a tad on the sweet side.\n\nToppings are rated last because no toppings can save a pizza with the previous three sucking. We got the pep and the pesto. Pep was peppy. Pretty standard. The pesto was just right! Just a good quick drizzle and not doused.

This place is ridiculous overpriced for the quality of food that they're serving. \n\nLet me break it down to ya Flava Flav...\"Yeaaaa Boooooyyyyy!!! I began to order a Medium 1/2 Hawaiian & 1/2 Nizarios Special, which is basically Pepperoni, Sausage, Red Onion, Mushrooms & Bell Peppers. \n\nI also had a huge craving for buffalo wings so I asked the dude how many is in an order. Guy informs me 6, 12 and whatever else he said after 12. I didn't really pay attention cause my fat-ass shouldn't even be considering eating more that 12 wings before a Medium Pizza. Dude then tells me that a 6 piece was like $8 and a 12 piece was something like $14 or $15. That's when I almost choked from my own saliva. I said $15 for 12 wings. Holy Sh$#!!! \n\nSo, my lack of a brain tried to calculate which would be cheaper...Ordering the 12 wings for $15 and getting a Small pizza OOOORRRR....ordering 6 wings and getting the medium pizza. My Mozaltof Ass wanted the wings more that the pizza so I decided to go for the 12 wings and a small pizza thinking that that would at least save me some big cash. How wrong was I! \n\nVinnie rings it up and say...$25.68. Holy Sh$#!!!! If my old fashion Asian Grandfather was still alive and he saw me order this overpriced pizza and actually paid for it, he would have taken a couple of fortune cookies from his restaurant and cracked it over my head. \n\nWTF!!! Who in there right mind would pay $25 for a small pizza and 12 buffalo wings? Duh...Me...the Sucka!!! Maybe I'm use to going to Ceasar' or Domino's where they have 2 large pizza for like $10? The pizza at Nizario's sucked bad. Crust was not crunchy and the pizza was just okay. \n\nListen my fellow Yelpers...Pizza should never cost a lot and you shouldn't pay that much either.... Unless....you're at a high end Italian restaurant where the ingredients are top notch and your date is either a super model with fake boobies or a Dude that has a big penis and drives a Ferrari oh....AND... will let you take it for a spin by yourself every now and then. \n\nI will never pay this much...Never Again!! Not from a damn pizza joint, using questionable ingredients, that sits right next to some dumb ass bar that has all the drunk idiots coming over to eat the crap cause they couldn't tell the difference between there ass and a good slice. \n\nWhoever gave this place 4 stars or higher is either Rich or Drunk! Or...maybe Drunkenly Rich! In either case, people who gave this place a good rating (you know who you are) should def have not taken all those shots of Tequila. Sober up, get into your BMW or hop onto your Vespa and go to New York or Boston for some cheaper...Kick-Ass Pizza! \n\nSorry for the ranging rants about this place yelpers.

When it finally got here, I have to admit, I was in extra cheesy heaven.  There is the possibility that one of the stars could be the winning beneficiary of circumstance.  \n\nI'm hoping that Luke A does not request that they add \"crow\" to the list of toppings.", "author": "P J."}

This is practically my favorite pizza spot in the city that's cheap enough for me to enjoy.  (NVM! it changed to a 4 star as soon as I sent out this review, haha)\n\nI love how this place is open late at night (but if it's too late, then Seniore's here we come). Perfect for them late night munchies or just for a nice warm slice of pizza.\n\nI used to get the pizza combo with chicken and pesto or something but I've made my own combo that for some reason, grosses everyone else out (cept the BF): Pesto, Pineapple, Mushroom. But we've also just recently made a whole pie combo of whole pesto, half pineapple, half pepperoni and it is by far the bessst pizza combo that I've ever gotten. And guess what? Nizario's makes it really, freakin good. (BTW, they probably have the best pesto tasting pizza as well)\n\nI can leave happy with a slice of my combo and a slice of pepperoni without feeling as though I've paid too much for pizza. Or we can leave happy with a medium or a large of our whole pizza combo (that's about $15-$18 bucks of pizza heaven).\n\nI hate crust. I hate it so much that I don't even feel terrible about wasting it... But for some reason, Nizario's crust is really good. It isn't doughy and it's not an overwhelmingly large amount of crust. It's not oily, it's not thick and it's not hella thin. It's perfect. \n\nWe usually don't eat inside since it's too small but it takes 15 mins for our orders to get ready which is perfect cuz it takes about 10 mins to drive there and the remaining 5 mins is to look for parking and walking there.\n\nThey take both cash and card but there's a minimum of what I believe is $7 to charge. Parking is usually easy to find and they WILL be open during Christmas eve (enjoyed that bit this year :]) and usually, the people are really nice unless they're on the phone trying to take down other peoples orders. \n\nEnjoy Nizario's and quit it with the sorry ratings, haha jk.

For those who have been following my reviews, my expertise is currently on Asian cuisine and sweets. Ironically, I grew up eating pizza pretty much almost every week if not more (hmm, more on that later). But, I came from a small town, too, so we had all the big-chain pizza places: Papa John's, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, etc.\n\nThere was one Italian place down the street in my hometown that made monstrous-sized pizza; I remember that pizza being delicious with warm freshly-pureed tomato for the sauce. That place was 5 stars definitely.\n\nAside from that background: Nizario's seems decent to me. Mellie P. and I got delivery from them last week and I didn't feel disappointed in the order. They actually delivered it relatively quickly, which is always a plus. We ordered half Hawaiian, half Pesto as our toppings; interesting combination, but it worked.\n\nOne thing about the pizza that made me feel surprised was the fact that it wasn't so greasy as most pizza joints are known for. The slices are large, and the crust was fresh. Unfortunately, by the time we got around to digging into the pizza (we waited a little bit because Mellie P. was preparing a salad for us), the pizza had gone cold. =\\ \n\nSo, in essence, I liked what I had, but I'll have to go back and try Nizario's again and get myself a piping-hot fresh slice.", "author": "Helene K."}

Of course, just like with any place, you've got to know what to order.\n\nIf you go in for a slice or two, only get something that has just come out of the oven.  If nothing is fresh, wait for the next pizza to come out.  Sure, you might have to slightly adjust your eating preferences, maybe even break vegetarian edge, but it's well worth it.  The only kind I'll turn down is Hawaiian.  Pineapple has no place on pizza.  What next?  Bananas?  That wouldn't taste good either.  Hawaiians are bizarre. \n\nIf you order for delivery, no matter how many people there are, always get an extra large.  For some reason, it tastes way better.  Besides, what you don't eat you can give to a homeless person.  Everybody wins.\n\nFollow these simple guidelines and you won't be disappointed.  I'm not your dad though, so I can't tell you what to do.

In fact I think I was too sober to enjoy the whole concept of this pizza place.\n\nThe concept: Late night pizza by the slice, great for soaking up some of that alcohol, super fast service because they re-heat the slice of pizza that was made around noon that day. \n\nSo yeah, the place was cheap and fast. Cardboard! Yes, cardboard sounds about right.  Crossing this place off the face of the earth sounds good to me!\n\nOh yeah, did I mention that one of my traits is that at times I can be a bit too honest.", "author": "Cellina B."}

It is a must read.  \n\nMr. Nizario is one of the most friendly people in the world!  I've been coming here for over a decade now...and it's a love hate relationship.  I love the pizza, but it makes it so hard to keep to my clean diet.  At night you'll find an overflow of people from the bar next door, but the line moves very quickly.\n\nTip #1  You must try the PESTO!! This is the place that introduced me to the green side.  At first I thought, \"Green stuff on my pizza?  It's like that green ketchup gimmick they came out with a few years back.  No thanks!\"  But pesto is simply a mixure of basil, pine nuts, parmesan cheese, and olive oil.  And it is DELICIOUS!\n\nTip #2  Also, I highly reccomend that you get the slices.  For some reason they taste infinitely better than getting a whole pie.  Some of it may be due to the fact that they are baked, and then heated again when you order.  It comes out to a crispy convection of perfection.  I also reccomend the Greco (feta cheese, GARLIC, and olives), but only if you carry a toothbrush on your persons.  \n\nTip #3  The former guy, Pablo, who used to make the pizzas has now gone on to culinary school.  Good for him!  He was the best at making your pizza.  Now it seems Mr. Nizario's sons and relatives have taken over the position.  The pizza is still good, but they tend to not heat it long enough so it comes out luke warm.  Not good!  Just make sure to ask them to heat it a bit longer, and it comes out perfect!", "author": "Joe O."}

And sometimes all you want is nice and simple. \n\nThere are some great pizzerias around this part of town - Giorgio's, Orgasmica, Gaspare's, and even Round Table.

Nizario's is where you can get that even well into the witching hours.\n\nWhile Nizario's seems clean enough (at least on the surface) it by no means has any atmosphere.  This is a place to get your eats and go.  While you wait for your piece of pie you can be awe-inspired by the few vintage poster-size photos they have of San Francisco.  Be transported back in time to when the GG Bridge was literally hanging by threads (or cables if you must) or see the city build-out from 190-something to 1950-ish.  Pretty cool.\n\nApparently started by a trio of brothers in the 80's, Nizario's is good for a quick slice - plain ol' cheese is recommended but if you order otherwise make sure they heat it up good so it tastes fresh as can be!

It's not the best in the city (for sure) but again, it's tasty. As a pizza connoisseur, Nizario's Pizza doesn't really match up against places such as Patxis or Little Star. However, as a \"pizza by the slice\" joint this place has my respect. The grease content on the slices is very minimal. The only thing I hate more than grease dripping on my clothes is grease grease dripping all over my face. I'm sure many of you pizza lovers out there have had issues with a grease-overload on your damn pizza. I automatically take a star away if I have to do that nasty-ass dabbing thing with the napkin. I really start to reflect on my life and all the bad decisions I've made whenever I have a handful of greasy napkins. You don't have to do this at Nizario's. This place DOES reheat their pizza. As far as that is concerned, I'm alright with it. When it comes to \"pizza by the slice\" places, I actually think baking the pizza a second time makes the slice taste nice and crispy. Pepperoni and cheese with a little crispiness added to it actually tastes pretty damn good.\n\nNow the customer service. The workers here have this attitude like, \"yeah, I work at a pizza place\". They are kind enough, but you are not going to really be blown away by these guys. They are there to pretty much just give you pizza that taste good. That's it. I could understand that. \n\nIn conclusion, if you just finished getting wasted at the bars and are ready to get your grub on then come to Nizario's.

Its exists only because it is near bars and when you need something after a night of drinking, it is often the only place open.\n\nTo be fair, i would give Nizario's 1 1/2 if you are absolutely wasted and you need something in your stomach.\n\nBut sober, there is absolutely no reason to eat here. Which is the mistake I made tonight.  As a USF student, I ate here a couple of times after a night out.  Always bad, but at least if u went around last call, the pizza was fresh because of the customers leaving the bars.\n\nTonight, I walked into Nizario's before going to see a band at Ireland's 32.  I wanted to get something in my stomach before having a beer, so I went in and asked what was fresh.\n\nThe slimebag behind the counter said, in the most used car salesman manner, \"everything is fresh out of the oven.\"  So i ordered a slice of the special.  I was handed a piece of what tasted like cold cardboard which had been sitting around all afternoon.  I took one bite and threw it away, thinking only of writing this review.\n\nI can excuse poor quality food.  I can even live with pizza that tastes worse than the generic frozen pizza from safeway.  But don't frickin lie to me and tell me day old pizza is fresh.  \n\nIf they will lie about the freshness of the pizza, there is no reason to trust them about anything. What they call fresh means day old, so what they call sausage might just as well be rat.  \n\nSo if you like rat pizza (maybe), try Nizario's.", "author": "John H."}

I'm not saying this happens often, but, you know, it could happen. It turns out your ego is bigger than your tolerance and you need some soakage. Pronto. Nizario's is there, offering up tasty slices of good pizza that are crusty enough to soak up the booze, but not greasy enough to make you paint the sidewalk.\n\n\n The planned scenario: You and 49 of your closest friends hire a bus to take you to see Journey and Def Leppard at the shoreline. You're all decked out in your best white trash rocker outfits, doing jello shots, taking swigs of Jack Daniel's, and the friend organizing the trip shows up with around 20 hot, fresh pies.

After calling 6 places at 2:32am, (including the Nizario's on 18th) these guys came through and took our order. An hour later I was summoned to call back and ask what happened to our pizza. It turned out one of our friends had gone out and told the driver to bring the pizza inside (through a dark alley into the middle of the block). The driver freaked and sped off thinking he was going to get jacked. So I sweettalked them into returning with our pies. They drove up 15minutes later with some heavy hitting backup, to find my punk white ass wearing a white tuxedo with cash in hand. That must of created quite a hazing back at the office.  You were scared of that little pansy cracker! What the hell is wrong with you? By that time we were already  laughing our asses off and enjoying the great pizza pies (early breakie at 4am).

They might not be your coolest, or the ones you wear on a date, but they are the ones you wear when you are running out the door to move your car before you get a ticket for street cleaning.  I have been going to Nazario's for 10 years now.  It is not the best pizza in SF, but when I am drunk at the end of the night, you could fool me.  You never have to wait long for your slice and I swear when you get it delivered, you will never say, \"the pizza is sure taking a long time.\"  Also, they deliver until 2.  Big Plus.  Slices are cheap and the guys that work there are real nice.  Nizario is always down to talk with his customers.  If you need a quick bite to eat, this is your place..", "author": "David C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-07", "description": "Note: I babble here a bit at the beginning.  If you want the Nizario's review, skip down a bit.\n\nMy feet touched the ground again in this fair city just 2 weeks ago after 4 years in NYC.  I've given up TV for a while and so I've decided to replace that time spent with, amongst other things, finding a decent pizza place in SF and reviewing all the steps along the way.  Lucky you. \n\nWhile in NYC, the phrase \"good Mexican food\" was oxymoronical.  As I remember from my first stint in SF, the same could be said for pizza here.  Like fog in the summer or snow in the winter, after a while it was something that I just accepted with quiet resignation.\n\nBut every once in a while, I head back to the well of frustration and anger and ask \"Why the f*#k can't people get this right?\"  And really, it is a fair question.  It isn't as though we're asking for brain surgery.  Why can't people figure out what a thin crust is supposed to be?  Or why I could possibly want avocado IN my burrito and not a little plastic thing on the side? (People who have lived in both places know exactly what I'm talking about.  People who haven't would be offended by both.)\n\nHence the reviews.\n\nThe elements or review are simple: quality of ingredients, quality of sauce, thinness of crust, crispiness of crust.  The last one only applies to single-slice orders since that crisp crust can only be achieved on the re-heat.  The quality of ingredients and sauce are straight foward elements.  Crust depth is always an issue of contention.  Some people love their bread.  Personally, I think it screws up the bread to ingredients ratio.  There are plenty of other ways to get more much bread that don't involve screwing up a perfectly decent pizza.\n\nI remember from my first stint in SF that Nizario's wasn't a bad option.  Without any food in the house and needing something quick, we ordered up a pie.  Delivery time was an unheard of 18 minutes, which was certainly appreciated because we were starving.  But even our starvation couldn't get us past how average this pizza was.  \n\ningredients: 4 out 10.  Probably canned.\nSauce: 3 out of 10.  Also likely canned - a little too sugary.\nCrust depth: 4 out of 10.  Too fluffy, but not the worst I've seen.  Think Pizza Hut.\nCrust crispiness: NA - full pie delivered, so crispiness not applicable. \n\nAll in, it ranked somewhere between mildly disappointing and rather underwhelming.  But hey, we were hungry and the delivery was quick.  So speed saves them from a single star.", "author": "A K."}

The crust is not too thin or too thick and each slice has a generous amount of sauce, cheese and other toppings.  No, you can't sit down and its kind of a dive, but I love it and it keeps me from having a nasty hangover the next morning!

I trek out on that Geary bus every time I'm in the city to get me some. They only get four stars cuz the last few times I was there they had no anchovies, WTF? Pesto with fishies is my fav and they do it the best. Sac has nothing to compare, makes me kinda sad.

This place is a hole in the wall with emphasis on damn simple and damn good pizza.  In fact, I like that there aren't enough chairs, that the interior is dirty and unkempt, there's always a line stretching out the door at 1:00 am.

I've been coming here since middle school and it's always the same great pizza. They always have their pre-made pizzas ready to order, but I'd rather order my own special pizza with all my favorite toppings :) YUM! Totally worth the wait. The dough is thick, chewy and a little crunch, just the way I like it. Cheap and super yummy. Much better than Round Table and those other chains. It's a small place so don't expect to fit a large group of people in there. There's a small counter for you to sit and eat at along with 2 other small tables and maybe 5 stools total :P But a lot of people end up taking the food out or eating it outside anyway so not a big deal. One time me and my girlfriends went in to order some slices and instead got two large pizzas for free!! Well, we took a picture with the workers and told em we'd send the pics over so they could post it on their website... I wonder if my friend ever sent the pictures, or if they even have a website haha :P Oh well, try it out... so worth it :)", "author": "Haim C."}
