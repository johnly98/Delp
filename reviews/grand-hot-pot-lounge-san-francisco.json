You can rent out a private room here that fits up to 40 people (we had about 30 I believe) for $29.99/person for 2 hours of all you can eat hot pot plus all you can drink beverages (including both non-alcoholic options like chrysanthemum tea, soy milk, or soda as well as alcoholic options like beer and sake) plus karaoke!! It's nuts. We actually got to keep our room for an additional 2 hours for karaoke for no extra charge so we had it for a total of 4 hours. At the end of the night it ended up being only around $39/person including tax and tip!\n\nFood was tasty, not only can you order all the regular hot pot fixin's but you can also order a selection of appetizers such as soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and salmon sashimi. Broth can be ordered regular, spicy, or half and half. \n\nKaraoke song selection was pretty good and included mostly the actual music videos! Only complaints are that their system makes it a little hard to find the songs you're looking for (especially for English songs) and that even though we had 30 people in our room we still only had 2 mics. \n\nI felt a little bad for the rest of the restaurant because we must have been so loud with our entire group belting out songs from BSB and Taylor Swift throughout the night =P. A great place to have a birthday or any other large group celebration!", "author": "Vivian L."}

When I first heard of an AYCE Hot Pot, AYCD, and karaoke place I thought it was too good to be true! \n\nThe food is pretty good for hot pot. What stands out is the variety on their menu. I would recommend to also check out the oysters and sashimi. The selection of veggies is pretty standard. I would also recommend on getting one spicy broth and one regular. \n\nIf you are looking to get a karaoke room, be sure to call for a reservation ASAP. There have been times I've called 5 days before I wanted to go and the rooms were already reserved. If you do find yourself in a situation where there aren't any karaoke rooms available, I would reserve a table outside in the main dining area and when you arrive mention you'd like a karaoke room if it opens up. I've been given a karaoke room towards the end of the night for a good deal.  \n\nOverall I would suggest this place for mostly the fun environment it provides for a big group.

Super fun, especially if you're getting all you can drink ;) \n\nThe reason for my 4 stars is that we asked for chicken for the hot pot and they gave us a plate of raw chicken touching other vegetables.

The sauces were available at the table.\n\nFor AYCD, I expected some really terrible beer and I was pleasantly surprised that they serve canned Sapporo and Tsingtao beer. I can't tell you how much Sapporo we consumed. We also had plenty of sake, chrysanthemum tea, and soy drink.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the karaoke! Although we only had 2 hours to consume food and alcohol, we were allowed to stay in the private room until closing time, which basically gave us 4 hours of karaoke time. As people started feeling full, they began singing. I like the karaoke machines at Chinese/Taiwanese places much more than the ones at Korean spots because they are all digital and you don't need to flip through a book endlessly.

I accidentally ordered with my eyes and I wanted to take my small portion home. I understand why they are super strict about that because then people would just order extra and take it home. BUT there are some people that just want to take a little doggy bag home...like me! I don't want to cheat the system, I just don't want to waste food :( \n\nI wonder if there is a solution to this dilemma...regardless, I am definitely coming back for the AYCE and DRINK and I am ordering the regular pot instead of the spicy pot.

I love hot pot, and although this place does not compare to others in terms of food/service quality, it's still pretty good for the price. They have the typical meats you usually get at hot pot restaurants such as lamb, beef, pork belly, etc. The house beef and lamb were my favorites. They have a decent selection of veggies as well, but be warned, the portions are huge! When we ordered enoki, they gave us three whole bundles of it. I prefer AYCE places where they give smaller portions of food so I can try a bit of everything so I tend to ask for half portions here. \n\nIn addition to hot pot items, they also have salmon sashimi, XLBs, and spicy Taiwanese cold appetizers. Strange, but it's included in the AYCE price so I'll take it! Sauces are on the table and the broths we ordered were good - probably full of MSG though since my friend and I were chugging water like no other after our meal. BUT, what really makes this place stand out to me is how they have (non-alcoholic) \"all you can drink\" too. I can't remember the drinks they have on their menu but my friend and I are huge Yeo's soy milk fans so we had like 3 cans each.

Located on busy Geary, you'd probably end up circling around before you settle to park in the residential area (2 hour zone). \n\nService - kinda nonexistent...they usually only have two servers walking around and I swear sometimes they just avoid making eye contact with you when you try to wave one down. So word of advice: order more than you normally would at a time, bc they're likely to give you small portions or forget a part of your order anyways. \n\nFood - pretty good! They have a variety of things you find at any traditional Chinese hot pot place. Thinly sliced beef and lamb, fish and meat balls, shelled seafood, tons of different green veggies, as well as some hot small appetizers and more!

There was only 1 waiter for our whole section to the left of the room which is about 10? big party tables. There was another man, assuming he's the boss, who would come around once in a while. \n\nThere were a few dishes that were pretty good. The beef was the best out of all the meats. The couple's delight and xiao long bao were pretty good too. What was upsetting was our waiter actually took our couples delight plate before we even finished. We then ordered another one and never got it. \n\nThis is my third time here and this is the first time they actually had sauce. However, the soup tasted a bit less flavorful.\n\nWhat comes with the AYCE is drinks. You can get a soda, sake etc. They give you tea like all Asian restaurants do and there is a cup already there for you when you sit. We ordered Sake and didnt get any cups for our sake. With the one waiter running around, we decided to just drink our tea and use the cup instead to drink the WATERED down sake. \n\nSince we only had one server, I had to go up to grab the menus myself every time we wanted to order. Also, we sat around a lot waiting for our food. We basically didn't eat too much because the food settled in our stomach faster than the food was coming out.\n\nMy friend had to use the restroom during dinner... and not to mention 3 of us had to uses the restroom throughout that night/next day or two.......

For a $16.99 AYCE lunch buffet, it still blows me away.\n\nMy friends and I are big hot pot eaters, and found grand hot pot lounge having everything we we'd expect from a pricier hot pot buffet - basic meats like lamb, kurobuta pork, beef, fish slices were popular options- so with that alone, I found this place a better deal than half of the non AYCE places in the bay LOL. \n\nBroth recommendations: I recommend staying away from their tom yum/ spicy broths... I've had them a couple times, but it just doesn't taste right. Go for their savory broths (it's harder to mess it up) like their herbal, miso, bone, etc. \n\nOh and the price doesn't include prawn, but give the nice restaurant people a break. They make up for it by having Xiao Long Bao (must order!!!!!!!!!!!), sashimi, condensed milk buns, canned drinks and some spicy Taiwanese appetizer dishes @___@ *drools. \n\nThe only feedback I have is on their housekeeping and overall decor. When you walk inside, it does feel a little sticky/ dark/ cold. I'm sure you all can guess that it used to be a night club. But yeah, some more light - maybe a window would go a longgg way. Also, sometimes the floors stick and the chairs move around a bit. It can be annoying, but for the price they're offering, I'd stand through the entire meal:D\n\nOverall impression: Good service (tip them well, dang it!), huge selection of meats and veggies and extra dishes.

The food selection is not bad, plenty of things to choose from and generally okay quality.\n\nKaraoke here is definitely geared towards Chinese people. The karaoke machine is only in Chinese and their English song selections are much more limited than other karaoke places. Although since the karaoke part comes free, we weren't complaining much.

As you sit down, you are given a sheet of paper to mark how much of each you want. I foolishly mark a box with scribbles; my girlfriend gives me a dumbfounded look.\n\nI think they have everything ready in the back, because our pot of mixed soup came out within the second we ordered. We were given a shit ton of napa cabbage to start, and about 3 cows worth of heavily marbled beef. If you're here for a meat fix, this is your spot.\n\n3.5 stars? The pot was left running at like 1000 degrees without us being told of the controls. A lot of the stuff given to us was frozen, but it's cool, we can use it to put out the fire that is the pot. \n\nTBH, I like how janky this place is, and how it DGAF that it's janky.

So the wait wasn't long.\n\nWe opted for the house original and house satay for broths.\n\nWhen the food came out, I thought it was decent quality meats and sides. They give more meats than other places. I got some szechuan chicken appetizer and it was pretty good. I enjoyed it. The shanghai dumplings were good too. I thought their beef balls were better than most places since they give you whole ones instead of small, weird ones. I like the beef and lamb. I got the short ribs but I realized I would opt for meats without the bone attached. I like the dumplings. fish cakes and chow fun. The chow fun noodles are fresh, and it was delicious in the satay broth. I was pretty impressed with the dishes to be honest, the quality wasn't bad for the price. Also, one thing that's nice here is that drinks are included. I didn't get anything alcoholic but I am always a big fan of Chinese soymilk. I noticed the drinks are canned, I saw canned soda as well. My soymilk was in a canned but it was still good.\n\nThey had the sauces I like here like satay and chili sauce. I think they also had a sesame one but I can't remember. I just used the soy sauce (possibly a house soy sauce?) with my satay and chili sauce, my usual combination!\n\nParking is Richmond district is better than other parts of the city in my opinion.

Overall, it was a lot of food and good value for the price. But this hot pot place won't make it onto my favorite hot pot restaurants list. Didn't really like the soup, the dipping sauce ingredients were a bit lacking, got 2 small pieces of corn, 4 little clams (which didn't seem all that fresh), the ramen looked a bit weird to me. The meat was just OK IMO (I like the meat at Shabu Club the best). Price includes soda or tea (I stuck with tea).

The amount of napa cabbage they gave was CRAZY, we ate an entire cabbage because we were scared of getting charged for leaving food behind... Lol. Certain foods are served frozen, not fresh.

Everything is inclusive from appetizers, meats, veggies, poultry, dessert, and drinks.\n\nEach tables has two induction plates for cooking. We decided to get the half spicy/half original broth since some of us like to eat super spicy food.

Otherwise you'll end up pissing off the waiter with several copies of the order sheet. Our table ate strictly supreme beef and lamb options with the accidental double order of marinated beef (you know who you are). Do not order the marinated beef! They also have an abundance of seafood as well but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to eat it due to my allergy. They have mussels, shrimp, and oysters! They also have a very comprehensive list of veggies as well. We went pretty crazy with bok choy, napa cabbage, ang choy, and water cress.

There is NOTHING wrong with the corn. That is the color of a mixed breed of blue corn and it's delicious!\n\nService wise was spotty.

The interior of the restaurant was strange-- gave me some old Chinese movie gang underground gambling vibes. I don't have any other way to explain it. On top of that, we see large groups of people going in and out of a mysterious door in the back as well an upstairs (we later secretly went in and found out that there are karaoke rooms WITH hotpot omg). My friends and I came here because the price was awesome. The AYCE hotpot + drinks is $25, which is a great deal compared to other hotpot places in this area. The food wasn't as bad as I expected but something felt off about it. I can't even explain it! I guess the food looked like plastic and the presentation was \"ghetto\" (?). The servers were pretty attentive... but you don't really have one server so when you ask for something they often times forget to bring it out and you eventually forget about it as well lol. The best part of the night: it was our friend's birthday and one of the workers played the happy birthday song on the karaoke TV when we cued him LOL! \nTLDR; the restaurant looks like an underground casino. Overall I wouldn't come back again but I'd still recommend it if you're looking for an affordable hot pot place for a large group.", "author": "Kayla S."}

The venue was huge with high ceilings, and the ambiance was quite nice. I was really impressed with the selection - especially the seafood and dim sum (the scallion pancakes were really good!) I'd also recommend getting the BBQ fresh oysters. The spicy soup was not that spicy but still quite flavorful. \n\nHowever, there was no sauce bar (!!) The only sauce you can choose from were some bottles on your table, which included soy sauce, BBQ sauce, sriracha sauce. It was quite sad for me because I quite enjoy sauce bars - especially the chili oils, cilantro, etc.  Also the only desserts they offered were asian pudding.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-10", "description": "I have been to this establishment about 10 times in the last couple of years, usually as a group of 4-8 people.  My friends and I frequented this place because they provide a variety of choices and the AYCE price is actually decent for what you get.  With that said, after my experience this past weekend, I will not go back.  And I will encourage my friends never to go back.\n\nThe Food\nSeems like the choices are getting slimmer and slimmer every time I go.  With that said, it still isn't bad.  A good assortment of meat, seafood and veggies.  The cooked food are hit or miss.  The salmon sashimi is by far the worst quality.  I LOVE salmon sashimi and I don't even order from this place.\n\nThe Order\nYou are given a menu and you mark the items you want and the quantity, and they bring it to you.  In 2 years, 10+ times I have been to this restaurant, they have NEVER GOTTEN the orders right.  I'd say they'll bring about 75% of what you marked every time.  They also tend to give you less meat and seafood and fill you with lots of veggies.  I'm assuming because meat/seafood are expensive and veggies are cheap.  Again, I had to order multiple times EVERY visit in order to get the right amount of meat that we wanted in the first place.  This is TRULY annoying.  But with the price, I dealt with it and I just kept asking for the menu and marked for more meat.\n\nThe Service\nMost of the staff are friendly and decent.  And this is where I drew the line this past weekend.  I was dealing with this one waiter who had a HUGE attitude issue.  As I mentioned before, they tend to bring you not enough meat even when you order several quantity of it.  So I asked this one tall waiter several times to bring more (8 pieces of thinly sliced beef for 4 people?  really? And I marked down 3 orders of it!).  That kid just gave me attitude.  And he never brought more food.  I gave him the menu which marked for 2 diet coke.  He brought over just one.  He kept staring at my table the whole night like he was going to start a fight.  He was also prancing around and not doing much (and he really didn't carry the same amount of weight as other wait staff).  Towards the end of the night, he walked towards our table with a couple of plates of meat, and ACTUALLY FAKED putting the meat down then walked away.  So yeah, this is the service I got.  ONE waiter, ruined everything.\n\nMy Decision\nAt the end of the night, I decided that I wasn't going to tip the meal.  This decision did not come lightly and it is something I have only done a hand full of times in my life.  I usually tip about 20% and DO understand the low wages and the hardship of the wait staff.  So it says a lot about my experience that evening.  I do feel bad that it impacted other wait staff that were friendly and doing their jobs. But ultimately, my decision came down to 2 reasons:  1) the fact that they have never been able to get the orders right and their tactics of giving your less meat every time; 2) the extreme rudeness of that ONE waiter that made my decision to never come to this restaurant again, and actually write a bad review about the place.  I hope that management will see this as an opportunity to change the operation, and take out the trash.", "author": "Derek W."}

Just put it this way I will never go back and would not recommend to anyone unless u have no standards than u casn knock yourself out at this shit hole.\nthe stuff that I order was \n1. fatty beef- would not feed this to my dog\n2. regular beef - will not even feed this to the dead\n3. pork bellies- can't even try to finish\n4.  raw salmon- did'nt even think it was actually salmon\n5. XLB-- the worst I have evre eaten beside DTF\n6. green onion pancake- this was probably the only eatable of all and thanks to supermarket for premade onion pancakes.\n7. squid- ok\n8. beef balls and other balls- If you people like balls than I guess is ok\n9. lamb-- how can u even mess up on this worst lamb ever texture is so tough basically I have to eat it raw.\n10.veggies- good basically u cannot mess this up.\nworst of all is the soup base we got the mix 1/2 spicy and 1/2 original. tell u the truth even if the meat was bad if the soup base was good this would of atlease balance it out but worst of all is the soup base and that is the most important structure of a HOT POT and is the soup base.\nmeat bad we can fix eat it a little raw less cook that will not be the tough but if the soup base is not good I dont care how good your product is The whole Idea of hot pot is all about the soup base. and u must hot pot with out all those sauce if u use the sauce than n mind as well just get a bowl of cook meat and just throw the sauce on top to eat it.I already though that I don't have any standard for eating but when I see those people eating in there man they r worst than me. don't even know what the hell r they putting in their mouth. To all you people out there that dont have a standard for eating the most important of eating is not about how big a portion or how cheap the food is for a restaurant. Thats how some no good restaurant is still open because now a days people r just eating cheap price with big portion. if like this they mind as well just eat garbage.

Because it was the top floor, our group was kind of neglected and if we wanted something we would have to wait for them to come up to us, they didn't do a good job on checking on us. Also, the karaoke is not worth it with the price so I wouldn't recommend reserving that room. The karaoke system is extremely hard to work with and there weren't much options for us to choose from.

The service though... I have never experienced anything like I've experienced at the Grand Hot Pot Lounge - and that's not a compliment.\n\nWhile the service was always pretty horrendous my first 5 or so trips there, I was willing to overlook it... For a $25 AYCE, I didn't mind receiving just half of the items that I checked off on the order sheet and having absolutely no attention from the waiters/waitresses. But my last experience there... that was the final straw that made me (and my roommates) to vow to never give this establishment anymore of our money.\n\nMy roommate and I arrived at around 8pm and the restaurant closed at 10pm, so we had plenty of time to eat. However, when we arrived, only the big tables that seat 6+ were available and we were not allowed to sit there. Fine, we'll wait. But at 8:30, we were asked to leave because apparently, they could not serve us in time before they closed. What...? Luckily, there was another small party also waiting for a table, so we offered to just share one of the large tables. Very very reluctantly, the servers agreed to seat us.\n\nAfter getting seated, we quickly ordered our food. As usual, it took over 30 minutes before we received the broth, less than half of the items that we ordered, and none of the sauces. Okay, let's walk over and ask for the sauce. 15 minutes later, still no sauce. Fine, the food tasted okay without and we were running out of time. At 9:30, while we were mid-meal, the servers brought us the bill because they wanted to cash out for the night. We quickly paid and gave our usual 18% tip (we, stupidly, still planned on returning at the time), but also explained that we still have not received over half of the items that we originally ordered. They brought us a new order sheet and told us to mark any items that we wanted.\n\nAfter making our selections, the servers took our order sheet and, as far as we know, threw it straight into the trash, because at 9:45, they came back and told us to wrap up our meal because they were going to close for the night.

I asked again for watermelon juice but unfortunately  her English couldn't differentiate. So no watermelon  juice. Got the soup. But no pot stickers again communication was an issue. OK.

We came on a Monday night - which isn't so packed.  The lighting and atmosphere inside is mellow.  I like the masks on the wall.  The inside of the place looks small but the place is actually quite spacious.  Its got an upstairs and hidden private rooms.  If you want to throw a private party, i'm sure they can cater to your needs and then some.  There were only a few people inside.  We took a booth which seats about 4 comfortably.\n\nTo order you mark a pink half sheet of paper with all the meats, veggies and extras you can handle (double-sided).  Hint:  don't go crazy ordering, they give you hella food.  Since it was our first time, we went crazy ordering hahah.  You can choose between 4 broths.  We chose original and spicy (50/50).  I suggest you go spicy (if you like spicy)  but the original was pleasant as well.  They have 5-6 different sauces on the table.  Hint:  be sure to mix well before spooning into the provided dipping bowls.  They have the peanut butter, spicy, soy, garlic, the standard brown sauce (I dunno what its called) and cilantro i think?  I mixed the cilantro, garlic, brown and spicy.  It was hella good and dipped well with everything.  Its tradition for most asians not to eat rice for hot pot, but hey if your a rice lover, knock yourself out.  We didn't order rice.  Here are the proteins we agreed on:\n\npork ribs\nwhite meat chicken\nfish\nlobster balls\nsquid\nfish balls\nsteak thinly sliced\nblood chunks\n\nveggies:\nmelon\nbock choy\nbroccoli\ndaikon\nfungus\ncabbage\n\nExtras:\nYou have to try the spicy fried chicken palms!  It was my first time and went perfect with my asahi beer.  Its kind of like palutan (palutan is tagalog for \"food that goes well when drinking).  Although my asian friends said you have to eat it the whole thing with the ligaments, sorry i spit out the palm and just ate the surrounding protein.  Who knew this food existed?  Where the heck have I been?  I love trying out new foods like this especially pleasing to the palate.\n\nSteamed spicy chicken - it was okay but still good.\n\nSalmon sashimi:  Yes they have it on the menu.  Very fresh but didn't go well with hotpot.  Glad I had it though!\n\nDessert:\n\nWe tried the bitter jello i forgot what is was called but its supposed to be healthy for you.  My friends said i would hate it but I actually liked it and finished the small bowl.  Hint:  you can ask for seconds on the dessert.  To top it off the mango mousse or whatever you call it will make your night.  Be sure to ask for two!  So worth it!\n\nI have nothing else to say but try this place.  Everything was good and fresh.

The half/half broth was tasty but otherwise more bang for your buck at other nearby hot pot/shabu places.  I might go back with a group to try the seemingly endless array of unique dishes but NEVER the hot pot again.  The prices though are a bit high for this type of cuisine.

The meat was average, compared to the beef at other hot pot places.  The noodles were very good with the hot broth - great consistency and taste.\n\nOutside of the food, I was surprised that they charge $1 for sauces.  While not unreasonable, it just felt like we're being nickled and dimed.  The ambiance was a little odd.  it was clear that we were sitting in the middle of what used to be a dancefloor.  Nothing really wrong with that, but just felt the setup was a out of place.  \n\nWhile there were some enjoyable bits, the strange ambiance and the wide-ranging quality in tastes makes me give this place a 3-star.

Staff was pretty attentive and were able to make some suggestions on what to order.  We wanted to hot pot but we also ordered the Guiling rice noodle soup.  It was pretty good and quite a huge bowl.  If you are allergic to peanuts then this dish is not for you.  It had some sort of bean, peanuts, slices of beef, pea shoots and preserved eggs.\n\nFor the hot pot we got the half and half broth, both were pretty tasty.  The spicy wasn't not too bad but had lots of peppercorns.  For the meats we ordered the supreme beef which I liked a lot and the pork belly.  We also ordered watercress, A-choy, enoki and wontons.  All this was too much for 2 girls, we had to take the meat to go no wasting food over here.\n\nOne tip though is to save your dollar and skip the sauce.  One I am too frugal to spend a whole dollar on sauce and two the food was tasty enough from being cooked in the broth!", "author": "Allison T."}

The tables are nicely spread apart and even has some tables upstairs. \n\nThe menu is massive and a majority of it has the \"spicy pepper\" next to it. It is a Sichuan restaurant so what do you expect?\n\nI decided to try out their hot pot. It is a menu PER item but with the 25% off, I figured why not. We got the half original and half spicy broth. The original side is a concoction of all these asian-y spices and herbs that wasn't bad. The spicy side was the side I loved. It was nice and spicy and they have the sichuan peppers that make your mouth numb, but it wasn't overpowering. \n\nThey have a bunch of different items on the menu. The meats were all really good, we got the supreme beef slices, fatty beef slices, and supreme lamb slices. None of them had a tough texture to them and I didn't get a sense of cheap leftover meat sitting in the fridge. Everything seemed fresh. \n\nThe dumplings were good. We tried the shanghai dumplings, regular dumplings, and wonton. I'd get those shanghai ones. Let them rest a little once you scoop them out of the pot, the soup inside is obviously hot! I really liked the tendon, but they sliced them super thin, so it was sort of hard to fish out. We didn't order too much but it definitely filled us up. \n\nMy dad seemed to like the chicken dish he ordered as well. \n\nAll in all, I'll be back. 25% is too good a deal to pass up!", "author": "Jeannie L."}

There's an upper deck and lower deck that look like it can be converted to a dance floor. On the right side, there are a bunch of asian mask. Plenty of tables.\nService: It was really odd when we arrived. There was maybe 3 parties seated with 3 waitress wandering around. We flagged one down and they said hold on, let us clean this table for you. I was confused because there were at least 5 empty tables that were completely clean. As that waitress was cleaning, another waitress popped up and sat us at a table. This shows there is no designated host and its pretty chaotic for an empty restaurant. Next compliant on this awesome service is their lack of checkup. There's 3 waitress and 6 parties so it should be easy to cycle around. \nFood: The only reason this place didn't get a 1 star. Food here is pretty good. We ordered the hot sour soup noodles, spicy beef with black sauce and this cold chicken in chili oil appetizer. All really good and perfect spicy level. After awhile my tongue went numb but it was worth it. The only thing was the hot and sour soup was a tad too oily at one point. \n\nRemarks: Good food. Spotty Parking. Spotty Service.

Menu selection wasn't too shabby, heard AYCE includes food and drinks so that's a plus. It's nice for a group outing. Food came out a bit later, but there was definitely a long lag time in dishes coming out. We forgot that we even ordered a couple of dishes since it was such a gap. One thing was that some of the vegetables seemed to be unwashed with actual pieces of dirt. GROSS. In my opinion, overall food was OK. Service is a bit of a miss, had to flag staff a few times, too. Now here's the thing that really irked my nerves. Went to pay the check for our dinner at the counter (using a credit card) and the worker who rang me up gave me my credit card receipt hastily telling me to sign. I was wondering why it seemed like he was rushing me and when I looked at the receipt, the tip part was ALREADY FILLED OUT. I asked him why is it filled out and he said that they charge a service fee. I was appalled! I asked him if it says that on the menu and he said no, it's just something that they do. I stood there continuing to question their actions in which he seemed dumbfounded only telling me just to sign the receipt. After a couple minutes of awkward back and forth and inquisition and talking to his coworker in Chinese, he sighed and said you can change it if you want. As if I was the problem! Now I understand if there was a note in the menu about it or if we had a large party, but for 2 people?! COME ON. Especially for 18% gratuity to be tacked on without any explanation. Also, if it really was a service charge, places usually add that charge on the itemized receipt, not just writing it in on the credit card receipt. That's just classless and tacky.

He asked me \"how many\" and pointed me to a table.  I've never been here but the menu was already on the table. $16 for a lunch all your can eat hot pot buffet.  I start to check stuff off and hand it to the guy.  Another waiter comes and start dropping stuff off.  No hello or how are you doing.  They assumed you know what you're getting yourself into. We start putting food in the hot pot and start eating.  Nobody checked if we needed anything so we had to wave the waiter down for more food.  The food was decent.  They have quite a selection of meats and vegetables.    They did have some cooked appetizers to choose from so we had the green onion pancake and dumpling which both were pretty good.  Also, comes with Free soda. So come here for a bargain hot pot experience for $16. The place is set up like a lounge with curved booths, two flat screens TV,  which was playing a movie while i was there and the lighting is pretty dark.", "author": "Jennifer P."}

The owners are the same people as the Washington Cafe place that offers all you can eat hot pot instead of charging you for every item or small dish here. They charge $5.95 for soup base, $3.95 for small dish of meat or veggies, $6 for thin sliced meat, etc. It can add up easily especially if you order normal dishes or appetizers. They just charge more for the same hot pot stuff but offer less variety than the other restaurant they own. The service was slow...took 15 minutes for us to flag someone down to order. The non hot pot stuff is overpriced also...seafood dishes are. $13 and up.  The shanghai dumplings were ok according to my gf and some spicy beef noodle soup was acceptable. Would not recommend this place.", "author": "Max P."}

I've only ever written one other yelp review because I'm usually not passionate enough to spend the time to review all the restaurants I go to but for Grand Hot Pot Lounge, it's more than worth it. This last time I came, they had an all you can eat menu for $15.99 and the menu included everything you can find on the normal lengthy hot pot menu. If you're looking for a great place to come have hot pot, this is the place to go, hands down.", "author": "Pauline L."}

Get the beef short rib with honey black pepper sauce -- it was recommended by the waitress and pretty well floored me. Succulent and rich cuts of meat, and big portions. I also enjoyed the beef pancake appetizer and the chicken with explosive peppers (spicy!). Great service, cool interior, overall fantastic experience. Highly recommended.", "author": "Uli Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-11", "description": "We arrived and there were many empty tables but, we had to wait 20 minutes while servers walked around or stood around talking to each other while a line formed for a table. The restaurant was not clean. Everything looked very dirty with power cords running to the tables for the hot pot. The service was the worst that I have ever experienced and the employees are rude. They took our order, brought part of the food and never came back. i had to get up and walk across the restaurant to ask for spoons, bowls, and rice that we ordered, and the bill. I asked for water twice and was coughing and they would not bring water. They ignored our request.  they acted annoyed when we asked for anything and could not be bothered to come to the table. The food was alright but, I have had much better hot pot in a clean environment with helpful servers. I will not return to this restaurant. It was a very bad experience and i would give less than one star if I could. The owner should see how their employees treat the customers and then they would understand why it's always empty. The dirty Asian night club atmosphere also doesn't work. You couldn't pay me to eat there again.", "author": "Susan R."}
