We were walk ins and got to see in the back at the bar area. \n\nThe menu was full of tasty items but we got great help from our waiter on what to order. \n\nThe salads were on the small side but very tasty. The arance betole (beet salad) had hearty pieces of beets and blood orange with a nice crisp flavor.  We also had Rucalo E Parmigiano which was like a Caesar salad. Tasty but small as well. \n\nThe Burata Acciughe was burata topped with an anchovy and a side of pesto. Magnificent. Omg. I could've eaten this myself and ordered more. Had it with the bread we asked for. \n\nWe ordered 3 pinsas for 4 of us and it was plenty.  The crust was thin. The flavors in each pinsa were heavenly. \nCasal Bertone. Mozzarella. Pecorino and honey. \nQuadraro. Tomato. Pecorino. Red onion. Hot chili pepper.  Not spicy. More sweet \nPinsa pesto/prosciutto. The pinsa special.  Yummmmm\n\nWe ordered a Tagliere Misto which was a board of three cheeses and meats since we saw it being served to someone else. Really didn't need it. It was a small portion. \n\nThe pinsa pistachio for dessert was interesting. I liked the piatachio filling but would've preferred a sweeter crust. \n\nThis place was packed and a diamond in the rough of a neighborhood. Loved the pinsas. Price point a bit on the high side.

This sounded irresistable, but so did everything else on the menu. The cheese melted in our mouths, and the flavors and textures were perfect.\n\nThe only downside is the service. Several times we had to scan the restaurant for our waitress. She was multitasking while other staff members seemed to be hanging around in the back. Conversations with customers took forever, and maybe it's because we were in a hurry to get to a musical.\n\nAt any rate, this was a delicious new place to get pizza.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-17", "description": "Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca is a moderately priced Italian/Sicilian/Sardinian restaurant that serves a wide variety of dishes but focuses particularly on its \"pinsas\" which are pizza-like dishes that have fluffier crust, less cheese, and more focus on unique flavors such as fish roe, honey, sausages, and arugula.\n\nThe pricing on their pinsas (~$16-22 as of July 2018) is a bit pricier than say California Pizza Kitchen but the volume of bread makes up for the price differential. We ordered 3 pinserias for 3 people and were nicely full afterwards.\n\nThe menu is a bit difficult to read as most of the cheeses and cured meat/sausages are named very specifically (examples of cheeses = straciatella, pecorino, burrata, crescenza; examples of cured meat/sausages = 'nduja, guanciale, bresaola) though the servers are very patient and will answer all question you have regarding the menu with a smile. \n\nThe pinsas themselves are very unique, with an emphasis on the bread rather than the toppings. The bread is fluffy with a bit of crunch and is a simple rectangular blob rather than the traditional circular pizza. We had the Casal Bertone (mozzarella + sausage), the Ostia (burrata + fish roe + sunflower sprouts), and another sausage based pizza and the Casal Bertone was hands down the tastiest and most similar to a pizza. We also enjoyed both of the other pizzas and notably the Ostia's purposely tepid temperature combined with the texture of the roe was a very fun and unique food experience. \n\nThe establishment oozes style and while 6th street is awful, this place is a little beacon of hope. It's tucked in an alleyway close to Mission Street with lights strung between the buildings and the restaurant itself is decorated with lots of traditional items that you might find in Italy. In the back is a small deli selling cheeses and cured meats.\n\nService was initially slow and we spent maybe 20+ minutes waiting at our table without anyone bringing drinks, taking our orders or answering questions but when we finally got served, all of the wait staff were patient, helpful, and fun to talk to.\n\nOverall this is a wonderful restaurant that deserves to be frequented often. Its food and flavor profiles are unique and the ingredients are authentic, its pricing is decent for San Francisco, the service is upbeat and fun, and the ambiance is perfect for dates or friends visiting from out of town. While the neighborhood it's located in is terrible, I wouldn't let it stop you from coming over to a wonderful experience. I teetered between a 4 and 5 star review and if the pinsas had been more cheese/sausage and less bread, I would have easily given this place 5-stars.", "author": "Andrew H."}

The toppings were all very high quality, I was particularly impressed with the taste of the cheeses.\n\nOf the three pizzas, we had the Garbatella, Maranella, and one of the vegetarian ones, but the name escapes me right now. The garbatella tasted like tuna with mayo, which while it doesn't sound that great, actually ended up tasting really good on the flatbread.\n\nThe maranella I though was only okay, even though its one of the more popular dishes. I thought the spicy pork sausage wasn't as good or amazing as I would have expected, but the cheese was quite good.\n\nThe focaccia der muratore was terrible, do not get that.

Since we spent a good deal of our lunch hour trying to find the restaurant, most of us opted for their prix-fixe lunch special: green salad, margherita pinsa, and an espresso. \n\nThe salad was simple but perfectly dressed, fresh, and flavorful. The pinsa was really where it was at though. The crust was light, chewy, and bubbly. The menu states its made from a mix of rice, wheat, and soy flours and that it is low-fat and low-cal. I am ready to accept this at face value so I don't feel guilty about downing nearly the entire pinsa in one sitting. I didn't feel gross in the way I would expect to after eating was essentially a large personal pizza halfway through the day. Each pie is served with its own pizza cutter, which was great for letting each of us decide how we preferred to attack our flatbreads. \n\nI can't comment on the espresso - I lead a caffeine-free existence (ugh) so I would have had to decline mine either way, but in the relaxed fashion of the restaurant it wasn't offered until we were finished with our meals and ready to head out. The rest of the group declined their espressos as well since we had to hightail it back to the office.

For me, the Casal Bertone way overshadowed it because it was so incredible. I've always been a sucker for honey on white pizzas but this took it to the next level. The combo with the salty and crispy guanciale was a dream. Also the big difference between a pinsa and a pizza is the way the crust is made.

But pinsas, a flatbread dating back to the days of the Roman empire, are a world away, and Montesacro Pinseria recreates them in a lovely setting. The definite standout of every pinsa that this place turns out is the chewy yet airy crust, which is much lighter than a typical American pizza crust, as it's made of a blend of rice, soy, and wheat flours and is therefore much easier to digest. \n\nComing in for lunch, we started with a few small plates--the rapette, or roasted baby beet salad with ricotta and sunflower sprouts, contained some of the sweetest, most tender beets I've had. The cavolfiori, or roasted cauliflower dressed with black olives, capers, and tomato was nice as well (though I wonder if it would have been better served warm). But of course the standout was the pinsa flatbreads--the Quadraro pinsa contained slices of guanciale (cured pork cheek) and a light tomato sauce, while the Montesacro came with some of the creamiest stracciatella buffalo cheese, along with lacinato kale, chilies, and even garum (an ancient fermented fish sauce)!

Flatbread stuffed with mortadella -- order it. Random pecorino choices -- ask the waitress for her preference and go with it. \n\nFour of us came for a birthday. We each ordered two things. I ordered the special \"flauto\" which was rolled flatbread with artichokes, peppers and ham. So good! I also chose a pecorino -- they have two -- and went with the waitress's pick. Why argue. \n\nWe ended with a mix of marinated veggies, a tuna flatbread (I wouldn't have ordered it but it was my favorite dish), beet salad, pork roast and something I can't remember.  Plus a forgettable Portuguese wine and a fantastic Spanish wine. \n\nThe \"ghetto cake\" was a desert hit as was the fennel pannacotta. \n\nThe dessert wine list included \"chinoti\" which are wines enhanced with herbs. Not unlike an Italian vermouth but more complex. The Barolo chinoto is excellent. \n\nWe brought in a bottle of champagne and the corkage fee was waived coz we ordered their wine as well. No champagne flutes, alas. \n\nThey have an extensive wine list, which is no surprise. \n\n\nIt's a delightful surprise on an unprepossessing alley. I've been getting services at an agency in the area for years. Montesacro was a brave pioneer in a very rough area just off Market Street. Don't be put off by the street people.

There's no way to tell if a line means it's truly exceptional or if it's Mama's (which in my opinion is not worth the wait but I digress).\n\nA friend of my husband, who happens to be a recent transplant from Southern Italy, recommended Montesacro Pinseria to us, saying it is an amazing traditional little pizza spot down an assuming alley off a shady street in the TL. I made a mental note and then promptly forgot (it's a rather long name too so it's not something you might easily remember). \n\nA few weeks later, my coworkers were chatting about and amazing Pinseria not far from our office that one of my coworkers stumbled upon. Same description, amazing traditional Italian spot in an unassuming alley off a shady TL street. I knew it was the same spot and this time picked up the name. Montesacro Pinseria.\n\nI was just telling my husband that I wanted our next date to be here when I saw my friend on Instagram happened to be hosting a happy hour at Montesacro and I was like - babe, this is destiny. We can eat some pizza and see Meliza. Winning. \n\nWe ended up missing the happy hour but sweet Meliza made a reservation for us (something we didn't know we needed! Thank you Meliza if you ever read this). \n\nAnyway, all of this is a rather long typical SF story of how you find out about an amazing traditional Italian place on an unassuming alley off a shady TL street. \n\nThe decor is a. bit vintage, a bit industrial, and overall stunning in its unique way. We enjoyed cheese the staff recommended to us and pizza. While we waited the owner gave us caprese salad as a kind gesture to us as friends of a friend, which made our hearts melt. It was delicious. \n\nI had the margherita pizza which is my go to when eating at more traditional Italian places. I prefer to taste the flavors in a good crust and fresh tomato sauce that have bells and whistles (I save that for when I want dominos). It was the most I've enjoyed a pizza since I was in Florence itself (I know, I sound like a prick, I am sorry). Really, we had a great time. I told my husband that this was the vision like teenager me had of older me haha :)\n\nWhen I got to work the next day, I told my coworkers who had mentioned it about our experience and recommended it to the ones who hadn't heard the previous conversation.

We had the Rapette salad which was out of this world- the nuts and sunflower seeds provided just the right amount of crunch, and the dressing was light and brought out the natural flavor of the beets. The Cotto e Bufala was just a hunk of mozzarella on some ham- all high quality and delicious ingredients, but it wasn't my personal favorite. The Maranella pinsa was my favorite- the flatbread is pillowy and tasty, and the broccolini tied the whole thing together.

We went here for dinner to try something else on the menu in the hopes that their whole menu was a mesmerizing as his first experience. This place is obviously popular, so maybe we just ordered the two most unimpressive things on the menu. \n\nWe waited over an hour with two [disappointing recommended] glasses of wine. Unfortunately they were out of the Porchetta (a popular item) so we ordered the Foccacia Der Moratore (flat bread with sliced ham) which was about 13$, and incredibly underwhelming. It was so boring, not flavorful, and overpriced for what it was. If it had some pesto or some sort of sauce or cheese in/on it we probably would have been much more satisfied with it, but it was just so dry and plain. \n\nThe pizza we went with was the Trullo. This was decent, but nothing special. It was topped with Italian sausage, mint, and shaved mushrooms. It was...alright. For a 20$ pizza, I was unimpressed. I will be giving this place a second chance, as my boyfriend continued to rave about the items he had a few days ago, but I might call ahead to make sure they have the appetizer he loved in stock before I eat here again. \n\nThe service was also nothing special. While our server had an impressive Italian accent, he was sparce, never came to ask how the food was, refill our drinks, or ask about desert. I ended up having to wave him down for our check before we left. \n\nThe ambience is cool - the vibe is definitely a good one; I'm just hoping we happened to go with the two duds on their menu. Fingers crossed that next time is a better experience. As I mentioned, this place is popular, so you would be doing yourself a favor if you make reservations.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI tried this place again....will NOT BE RETURNING. Our waiter was basically non-existent. We had to flag him down every time we needed anything. Also we ordered 3 pizzas for a group of 4, as the pizzas are fairly small, and they brought all of them at the same time rather than staggering them to our table. The table was so small there just wasn't room for everything. Also he did not refill out drinks even once, and I had to ask 2 different people to bring some water to our table after the waiter neglected to bring it twice.\n\nThe bill ended up being about $150 before tip for one appetizer, 3 pizzas, and a bottle of wine. A little bit pricey considering the small size of the pizzas, and the fact that the ($18) appetizer was literally just 5 small, thin deli slices of porchetta..but I would have been fine with that had we gotten any sort of customer service.

I don't think we can go back to pizza after having pinsas here!\n\nOur favorite things to order include: the porchetta, the Maranella pinsa (burrata and spicy sausage), the Tor di Quinto pinsa (smoked salmon and dill), and the olive oil cake.\n\nThough the food is amazing on its own, what really puts Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca over-the-top is its authentic European feel and ambiance. It really transports you and makes you feel like you're not in America, and it's not just because you hear Italian being spoken by the staff and many of the guests!\n\nThat all being said, this restaurant rightfully comes up every time my fianc\u00e9e are brainstorming for a date night dinner. As long as we make a reservation, we never mind making the trip or searching for parking deep in the heart of SOMA to dine at this San Francisco gem!", "author": "Ryan M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-16", "description": "Just in case you haven't heard already, Montesacro is all about pinsa, not pizza. While the toppings might be the same, pinsa takes on an oval/rectangular flatbread shape and uses rice, wheat, and soy flour. It's all heated in their brick ovens which feature prominently in the venue, and the result is quite a thin, flavorful crust. When you add ingredients like mozzarella, broccolini, spicy pork sausage, and stracciatella di burrata as in their maranella pinsa, you get quite a delicious treat that's hard to put down, even if you try to pace yourself with the cutting wheel that they give you. \n\nService is courteous and professional here. Despite the fact that it's made fresh to order, the pinsa doesn't take terribly long to come out. The venue is tucked into a SoMa side street and is not necessarily easy to spot, but once inside, it's a warm, inviting space that fits lots of parties big and small. A welcome addition to the West Bay dining scene!", "author": "Vincent L."}

We were seated and the wait staff was exceptionally friendly.  We placed our food order and then ordered two draft beers.  For whatever reason, they had no draft beer so I looked at the bottled beer on the menu focusing on the description and not the price and trying to make a quick decision as the waiter stood there waiting (all the draft beers were $7 or $8 and mentally that's what I assumed the bottled beer would be).   \n\nOur Panzanella salad arrived - tomato, cucumber, red onion, black olive, basil, crouton and red wine vinegar.  A rather small portion and at $15 I would have expected more than a few slivers of onion and two olives sliced in half.  All in all, rather disappointing.\n\nNext, our pinsa arrived.  Unlike pizza, the pinsa crust is made of rice, soy and wheat.  We ordered the Maranella (broccolini and sausage).  It was absolutely amazing and we enjoyed it very much.\n\nWe didn't sample any deserts and then the bill arrived.  Imagine my shock when I saw a $25 charge for one of the beers and a $19 charge for the second bottle of beer.  In disbelief I looked at the menu.  Sure enough, in black and white, that was the cost of the two beers I ordered.  Yes, I accept responsibility for failing to note the cost (though to repeat I was feeling rushed having already chosen two draft beers they didn't have and hurrying to make a decision for bottled beer while the waiter waited) but Good Grief! $44 for two bottles of beer?  That was more than the salad and pinza combined.\n\nBottom line:  the pinza is excellent, the salad is mediocre in taste and portion size and, I'm sorry, there is NO reason in the world to have outrageously priced beers on the menu (they weren't even that good or cold).", "author": "Gary E."}

Shortly we came upon an alleyway that looked more Little Italy New York than San Francisco, I liked quirky unexpected European looking restaurants as much as those posh, white table linen Michelin 3 star experience, and he liked dive bars with counter space dining. This is a good compromise for both, especially considering that he, despite his flawless American accent, is an European. He appeared impressed with his own choice, and snatched a table for two. I have this theory that people yield to good looking people, especially when a woman (hostess) sees a good looking man. I think he was used to that treatment since he was young, because we've never ever had trouble finding good tables without reservation, the only time he'd failed and I've succeeded was when it was a man greeting us. Not this time, the hostess led us to a table in the back, close to the meat counter, private and quiet, near all the exposed brick walls, treated, like you'd find in old town Italy. I had a view to the kitchen and to the main dining room, and he had a view of me, which he did not seem to mind.\n\nI thanked him for this unusual find. He laughed, \"I just used Yelp. You know, some people write reviews about restaurants they eat at...You just pick the ones you like. \" Emphasize on \"some people\". He was mocking me a little,  having read one too many of my ROTD's.\n\nReally, even if you have no other reason but to return that horrible shirt your girlfriend got at Bloomingdales, you should make your way here, it's charming, old school Italian, and quite unusual selection of flatbread. Don't get fooled by the establishment's Yelp category of \"Pizza\", it's not your typical pizza, not by a long stretch of imagination except for the flat non round bread part that's called pinsa, which is, apparently the street version of pizza.\n\nWe start with charcuterie with cheese. He said \"I think you like this.\" I think he knows that we like similar food and yes I do like things that resemble French food. I am due to return to my summer home in Burgundy in three weeks and this was meant to be a goodbye dinner of a sort. Italian cheeses are different from French cheese, more similar to Spanish cheese, but still, somewhat different, milder, more ash than creamy. This place serves good looking Italian cheeses to go with nice assortment of cured meats. It came with jam yet no bread on the table. So I asked for a side of bread. Don't expect baguette however. More of your typical Italian bread that you'd find in New York. \n\nHe ordered two glasses of red. When he's drunk his, he'd switch glasses, leaving his empty glass to me. He'd then finish my glass, and order another. I can only drink a sip or two. I remember the days when he only seemed to drink white. I have this theory (yes, another). People in their 40s go through a phase, they stop drinking red because their body cannot digest it, as they enter 50s, they can drink red again. He was in his early 30s when I first met him. He only drank bier then. In his 40s, we met again, at a restaurant not unlike this one, he told me that he had become a father, and was surprised to find me still looking exactly the same. He was holding a glass of white wine that night, in a dark gray suit that looked slightly too large on him. He ordered a glass of white for me too - but I smiled and told him that I only drank red.\n\nThey brought out our pinsa, a flat bread, topped with tuna and other things. It was the first time that I'd seen tuna on a pizza. I handed him the pizza cutter, he gave me the first slice, then he took it back from my plate, said that it did not have enough topping on it, and handed me another. I wondered how many women have their food plated by their partner like this. This was the only way I know how when dining with him. \n\nI took a bite of the bread, it had a fresh oven burnt flavor to it, there were not excessive cheese, just enough meat and veggies. It's the poor man's pizza, but like many poor man's version of things, it usually is better than the commercialized version. Try this before you go back to Domino's. \n\nThis was a slice of oasis from the 6th street. Here you could feel the old San Francisco charm, not tainted by the street that had begun its decline two years ago. Here you could still get a decent meal, lost in time and space, feeling safe and sound.", "author": "Victoria E."}

While their specialty isn't pizza, but rather pinsa, it's just pizza with a different, tastier, fresher crust.\n\nThe food is delicious for pizza styled Italian food, with the variety feeling authentic, fresh tasting ingredients, and just being overall good food. It's uneven instead of the normal perfectly round pizzas, and gives the food more character. The crust itself is different and brings a lot to change the composition of the food. The ambiance is also great, cozy, with a slight busyness to it that makes it feel alive. It's a great place to hang out with friends, or go on a date.\n\nWhile enjoyable, there are a couple of things that worsen the experience. First and foremost is you are on 6th Street and Market, perhaps one of the dirtiest, and messed up streets in San Francisco. Not pleasant walking to, or from the place. It's also a little expensive. Maybe it's just a personal thing, but spending $20~ for a small personal pizza, albeit a good one, just seems a little overpriced to me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-09", "description": "I have officially found my new go-to place for some delicious bites in San Francisco's South of Market's Theatre District. Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca is the place to get great charcuteries and salads but their biggest claim to fame is their unique flatbread pizzas which are so fabulous and tasty that each of them comes with their own rolling pizza cutter! Montesacro is named after a small working class neighborhood in Rome, while the restaurant itself takes its inspiration from the classic \"fraschette\" or Italian deli so to speak and they offer these delightful \"pinsa\" which is a modern take on the ancient flatbread that used to be served by peasants of the Roman Empire.  The pizza here at Montescaro with its numerous toppings and rice based and therefore gluten free flatbreads made for a meal of divinity.\n\nBut let's begin a the beginning, so to speak, my friend managed to get great theatre tickets at the nearby Orpheum Theatre, which is literally only a five minute walk away. This restaurant is very hard to find, it's on Stevenson Street, which itself is an alleyway and it's not in the safest area in the town. There's no real big sign announcing the place, just a small sandwich board with an arrow pointing to the entrance. Our four-top table was not in the most ideal location of the restaurant, as we were sat right behind the hostess desk smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. The busier it got at Montesacro ,the louder it got, not to mention the warmer it got. I'm not sure what this restaurant used to be in a previous life, but I can imagine it being some sort of meat or fish market back in the old meatpacking district days, but now that it's firmly ensconced as a restaurant they've still managed to keep that old world ambiance with a number of antiques serving as accoutrements. \n\nEven though we arrived as Happy Hour was just about to end, our server honored their wine deal which was a Schiavo Red Wine for 7 dollars. We ordered four glasses of that and it went down very smoothly and paired perfectly with all of our bites. When my friend wanted a second glass after 6, they made sure to charge her the regular price, so they know what they're doing even as they are slammed with customers. For my starter, I went with the Sott'oli which was a choice of house-marinated vegetables for five dollars each. Out of six choices they had on their menu, I asked our server what were the most popular, she said the mushrooms, zucchine and eggplant, so I went with those options. I loved the roasted eggplants and the armillaria style mushrooms. They were all seasoned well and nicely marinated and there was so much food on that one dish, we easily could have split it between us all. My friend went with one of the insalatas, the crudo di aspargi which featured thinly shaved raw asparagus, wild arugula, English peas, parmigiano reggiano drizzled with lemon dressing, I thought it was a solid, if slightly over-peppered salad.     \n\nThen it was time to pick out our pizzas, again I went with the recommendation of our server, as she said one of the most popular was the Pietralata which featured grated pecorino/ parmigiano, mozzarella, guanciale, a hard boiled organic egg mashed up, and cracked black pepper. I loved how creamy each bite was with all of the cheese on the flatbread, which had a nicely charged crust topped with plenty of those pizza bubbles we all love. The guanciale, which is basically cured Italian pork, provided a tasty bite with each piece of pizza I cut with my pizza slicer. My dining mates had hits and misses with their choices as the Centocelle was another crowd-pleaser filled with plenty of ingredients including mozzarella, tomato, artichokes, mushrooms, olives, a hard boiled egg cut in half and plenty of prosciutto di parma. The pizza was artwork on a dish as all of the ingredients were laid out perfectly on the flatbread. One pizza that missed the mark with our table was the Torpignattara with its olive oil crushed potatoes, string beans, homemade pesto and toasted pine nuts. This vegetarian option looked good on paper and looked even better on the place but once we all tried a bite we all noticed one thing, the potatoes as it was prepared on that flatbread overpowered every bite and shrouded the other ingredients. Since it was basically a mashed potato spread on the flatbread, it seemed to make every bite soggy.   \n\nBut one miss of dinner didn't damper our evening, in fact once we got the bill, our total literally came out to fifty dollars a person including tip and the typical San Francisco health care surcharge, which in this day in age is not a bad deal. I'm so glad I have a new go-to place to eat before I see any show at the Orpheum or Golden Gate Theatres. You'll need reservations as it can get really packed at Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca during dinner time. A good down home place for uniquely traditional pizza pies from Italy can't be a secret for that much longer!", "author": "Jason F."}

The salads and pinsa (think pizza) are delicious. Had a cheese and marinara one and a sausage. Both were excellent with the bubbly crust from their large brick ovens. Server suggested an excellent wine by the glass. \n\nWas there for Saturday lunch and the place was filled.

It's always perfection. \nWe've had 3 types so far.  Prices ranging from $17-26. The spicy sausage with mushroom and tomato sauce, spicy sausage with broccolini and cheese and the porcini mushroom pinsa. \nGet the one with the tomato sauce first, sausage second and the mushroom last. I loved the mushroom, but I saved the sausage slice last to end on a high note. \nThe porchetta is an indulgent four thin slices of buttery fatty pork for $16.

While I am not an Italian immigrant like my grandma, I feel as though her high standards for pizza or in this case pinsas was passed down to me as well. I am not one for just grabbing a slice or sitting down at any random pizza joint in SF or any city for that matter. Yes, even those US or international cities with their own style of pizza. My skepticism had me a little concerned when my husband who is more open to eating anything with pizza or pinsa in the name indicated that we should try this place my excuses rolled in. Oh well, it's down and alley right, it's got a reservation, probably will be too busy, etc. Luckily my husband was able to woo me into a visit. The atmosphere of the restaurant and its alley way location made it feel like a restaurant strait out of Italy. Most of the staff was bilingual and you could hear Romance language being used to answer questions or converse with the clientele throughout the restaurant. The restaurant had its core menu focused on its pinsas of which we tried to two -- the LaMaro and the Margarita. The Margarita was a very traditional pie with five basic ingredients - mozzarella, basil, tomato, sauce, and the wheat/rice/soy base. Unlike the Margarita, the Lamaro was a spicy pinsa with chili threads and pepper. My husband also ordered salmon meatballs as a topping for the Lamaro a item, while not listed on the menu, perfectly complemented this pie. I would definitely return to this restaurant for lunch or dinner and order again. The flatbread crust had the perfect crisp texture and the sauces fresh thick tomato flavor reminiscent of my previous trips aboard.", "author": "Dawn B."}

I found some real gems and MPE is one of them.\n\nCame on Friday at 6:15 with a party of 4 and they gave us a table as long as we would be done by the 740 reservation. The space is really cool and the old ovens really do impress. The servers largely had Italian accents and the tables/chairs were old and colorful. Definitely felt like I was dining in Europe!\n\nWe ordered a salad with beets and goat cheese to start and shared 3 pinsa. The salad was actually a generous portion and the 3 pinsa were more than enough for our group of 4. We got a margherita, the maranella (spicy sausage and broccolini), and one with prosciutto and pesto/pine nuts. I liked all 3 but the maranella was my fave. \n\nWe also ordered some drinks to start. I highly recommend their Ros\u00e9 (the Tempranillo blend). They seemed to have a good wine list--comprehensive but not overwhelming. \n\nPinsa came out very fast. It's definitely lighter than regular pizza but the claims of it being \"low in calories\" is BS. It's covered in cheese and meats after all. Just enjoy your food and worry about your diet at another restaurant ;) The char on the crust here is unreal and the pinsa come whole--pizza cutters are given to cut to your liking. \n\nEverything we ate was simple and delicious. Refreshing to have a pizza place I know is good and is centrally located. Adding this to our dinner and date night rotation! \n\n*Notes on the location.*\nMPE is in an alley on Stevenson/6th. If that makes you nervous, don't come. If you are worried about \"sketchy\" or \"seedy\" neighborhoods, stay in a part of the city more to your liking/sensibilities and leave the pinsa for the rest of us.

It's a hidden gem, where the food and atmosphere can take you back to Italy in an instant! \n\nFor lunch they have this awesome deal for a small salad, margherita pizza and an espresso for 15 bucks!! What a deal!! And during the day it seems like the servers are young but still good service! \n\nNow at night for dinner, totally different atmosphere! Servers are speaking Italian left and right and when they talk to you their thick accent can be heard, I love it!! Like being in a restaurant in Italy! Except these servers are nice! Now for the food! First of all their pizzas are pinsa! So oblong shaped pinsa with thin bubbly crusts made for you right in their brick oven! And you cut the pinsa yourself :) so you control whether you wana share or not! \n\n-maranella: not sure if I spelled this correctly but whatever you do, get it! I don't care if you think broccoli can't be on pizza but just get it!!! Comes with broccolini, olive oil, sausage and just wait for it....burrata cheeeeese! If I were to die and go to heaven, I hope this pinsa exists in heaven! That good! \n-margherita: so simple but so delicious! What I miss about Italian food is that their marinara sauce is sweet!

Not basic at all! And when you ask your server for advice, it isn't like other places where they're like yea it's good, they really describe the food and get down to what you might enjoy! Just overlook the hustle and bustle at night, it's not that bad! If you are worried then come during the day. \n\nWhen you come here, order your food sip on some wine, and take your time eating!

San Francisco has changed so much in the last decade that it's disheartening. Do we seriously need a luxury high rise apartment building on every freakin' corner or a $7 bottle of free-range water at the newest haute cafe?\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed drastically is the batsh*t craziness on 6th street.\n\nI can have a 10 minute conversation with a metal pole and it would be perfectly normal. If I did that in Pac Heights, I would end up in a straitjacket.\n\nI've been wanting to try Montesacro Pinseria-Enoteca since they opened last year but the location has deterred me. I've had two ubers cancel on me when I was in the area in broad daylight (at noon). I spoke with several drivers and they told me they usually avoid picking up people from this area for safety reasons so plan accordingly via public transportation or your own ride, rice rocket, pocket rocket, whip, etc. If you decide to drive there and have an early dinner, plenty of street parking can be found on Stevenson if you enter through 7th street. \n\nMy friend and I came to Montesacro for an early dinner several months ago in January (sorry, I'm super behind on reviews). Reservations are highly recommended as it was pretty full by the time we finished at 6:30 pm.\n\nOn the menu are salads, cheese & charcuterie, and pinsas (beer & wine only). Montesacro boosts to be the only pinseria in the United States to serve pinsa, a roman-style flatbread that came before pizza. They use a blend of rice, soy, and wheat flour that's proofed for 72 hours producing a low-fat and low-carb flatbread.  \n\nMy friend and I started with the Radicchio Salad w/ arugula, bosc pear, forme d'ambert bleu cheese, almonds ($13): http://bit.ly/1RpauEF. Everything was fresh but it was just a very ordinary salad. Next time, I would skip the salad and go for a cheese & charcuterie platter that we were eyeing on other tables.\n\nWe shared two pinsas. The first one was the Maranella Pinsa w/ burrata, spicy pork sausage, broccolini ($18): http://bit.ly/1SjSCrm. Loved the savory sausage and creamy burrata but we weren't keen on the broccolini. Not only did it weigh down the pinsa but it was difficult to take one clean bite without tearing through the fibers of the broccolini or the entire stalk just falling off. Personally, I think shaved fennel would have worked better. But let's talk about that crust...it was lightly crispy, fluffy, and with a subtle chew. So amazingly simple and delicious. \n\nFor our second pinsa, we ordered the special of the night: Imported mozzarella, chanterelles, shaved black truffles ($30): http://bit.ly/1TgASlz. It was love at first bite. The soft, stretchy cheese along with the earthy mushrooms, and luxurious shavings of fragrant black truffles on that amazing flatbread was sublime. This pinsa is worth the a trip to the batsh*t craziness on 6th street.\n\nService is very leisurely (read: S-L-O-W). We were one of two tables when we arrived and it took over 40 minutes to get our first pinsa. If you're in a rush, I would go elsewhere. The staff wasn't very warm nor attentive, and I felt our server did the absolute minimum by just taking our order and delivering our food. It would have been nice if she checked in with us at least  one time during dinner but she didn't.\n\nLove the rustic atmosphere of Montesacro so it's great for a casual date; not recommended for large groups but there is one large communal table. There's also counter seating at the bar if you want to go solo which is exactly what I plan to do next time so I can hoard the entire pinsa to myself.

What it wasn't served with was any type of toast or bread. I sat and waited for someone to come by so I could ask. Nope, didn't happen. So I ate it with my knife and fork.

We order from them all the time and I've eaten at the restaurant a couple of times as well. Margherita is a classic, the ingredients are simple but just absolutely delicious. I also like the Centocelle and the Maranella. The options for delivery via Uber Eats are a little more limited, but still has a good variety. The service was friendly and attentive when I was at the restaurant as well, and I really enjoy the homie vibe. I'm a big fan!", "author": "Nana L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-16", "description": "If you like pizza, you'll definitely like pinsa, its very similar but more ancient and precious Roman cousin. Montesacro is apparently the first pinseria in the country, and it opened like a year and a half ago. I believe it. Pinsa is not exactly pizza but it is almost exactly pizza. It's enough like pizza that some bad pizza places (the ones that make thick, doughy crusts) are more or less making bad pinsa. It's also enough like pizza that no one would open a pinsa parlor outside of, say, NY/LA/SF, for fear of being mocked into bankruptcy.\n\nI happen to be a NY/LA/SF kind of woman, and I loved Montesacro, though less for its pinseria designation than for its wonderful food, service, and atmosphere. My husband Matt B. and I were staying in Union Square and walked over for a Friday lunch. It was bustling but not packed, and we got a table right away. Lovely space--high ceilings, natural light, casually rustic Italian deli decor. Service was excellent. We had a very warm, helpful waiter who took great care of us. \n\nWe drank a couple glasses of wine--a Rioja and a Bellone--and enjoyed a splendid, relaxing pinsa lunch. I ordered the maranella pinsa, and Matt got the $15 lunch special--salad, margherita, and espresso. The pinsas were delicious, fresh pies with fluffy, flavorful flatbread crusts. The maranella came topped with stracciatella di burrata, broccolini, and spicy pork sausage. I generally prefer tomato sauce on my pizza, but this was just perfect, the cheese creamy and gooey, the broccolini tender and full of fired flavor. The sausage was spectacular--I dropped a piece on the floor and if I weren't in public, I would have picked it up. (Instead, I mourned it quietly.) The margherita was also great, classic mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza with that pinsa twist. The salad was a nice healthy side, if nothing special. Mixed greens, lightly dressed.\n\nWe finished our meal with the espresso and a mug of chocolate budino. This is not to be missed. It was rich but not so rich it was hard to eat, with a lush, decadent texture and a dollop of thick whipped cream.\n\nI wasn't expecting anything in particular from Montesacro--it was just a place my husband found on Yelp when we woke up hungry. It ended up being one of the most pleasant, satisfying lunches of my year, and I hope to repeat it when I'm back in the Bay.", "author": "Steph C."}

Why, do you ask? because it is located in the scary extension of the tenderloin in an alley with excrement and passed out alcoholics on the sidewalk.  If we hadnt used our credit card we would have driven by and not parked in the $15 safe lot for a 1.5 hour lunch.\nSecond, the pinseria pizza is doughy and the topping cheese was skimpy and the sausage few.  Not worth 20 bucks.\nThe crudite plate looked like someone had cleaned out the back of the refrigerator.  \nThe presentation of the salad, the eggplant was weak.\nIn sum, nothing special here, pricey, and in a terrrible scary neighborhood.  \nIt should be a place the SF City Supervisors should have to walk to so they can appreciate the beauty of the SF streets.", "author": "Skip D."}

It's a small restaurant tucked away on Stevenson off shady 6th street, but once you walk into the restaurant it's like an oasis. Adorable ambiance -- it seems authentic to its Italian roots without trying too hard.\n\nNow let's talk food. Last night, we went for the kale salad to start, which had a wonderful caesar-like dressing with parmesan cheese and very light croutons. It won't blow you away but it's a solid way to start. \n\nThey also have a wonderful cheese and charcuterie selection. We had a delicious soppressata and our server recommended a dolce treviso to pair with it. I had never heard of that cheese but it was a wonderful buffalo, cow and goat cheese blend. Delicious!\n\nFinally, the pinsa! Yum! You really can't go wrong here. I'm very partial to the Maranella, with spicy pork sausage and burrata. The burrata is perfectly creamy and the sausage has just the right amount of spice. And the pinsa dough is incredible. I'm definitely coming back for more of this!\n\nThe wine selections are on point and our server guided us to wonderful pairings with our food. The list leans to Italians varietals but I had a wonderful German wine that I never would have selected on my own. \n\nThis is a great spot to have dinner before heading to the theater, and I'd love to come back on the weekend for a more leisurely dinner and explore the menu a bit more. Just be careful on your walk to MPE -- 6th Street is shady at best.", "author": "Catherine K."}

The presentation and creativity of the food is what you expect. We had two nice salads (tomato and mozzarella was simple but delicious). We also had the Tagliere Misto - if you're a fan of charcuterie you'll appreciate the board. The Margherita was perfect for the teens - light, crispy, and perfectly cooked. The Maranella and Pietralata were both tasty combinations of veggies and meats on a flaky crust. And we found a decent bottle of Sangiovese on the wine menu which wasn't over the top budget-wise. \n\nThe negatives...it was hot. A little crank of AC would have been nice. And the greeter (who also ended up being our server) was rude, condescending (correcting our pronunciation of Italian words, really?), forgetful (still waiting for the celebration of the birthday we came for), and inattentive (if you're going to keep it 85 degrees in the restaurant then at least bring us more water). \n\nIn the end, party of 7 with three teenagers, four pizzas, and one bottle of wine was $250. Eh, for a hot-stuffy restaurant with rude service it wasn't well spent. Maybe stick to lunch or happy hour.", "author": "Michael E."}

The cheese tastings were fabulous and came with honey and a homemade jam.

However, take-out was not a factor in this review. The food received was clearly not worthy of the 4.5 stars that this establishment has. Let's break it down.\n\nI ordered the Torpignattara pizza. I'm no expert in Italian, but I believe that it translates to \"mashed potato, green beans and pine nuts haphazardly thrown on dough\". I love potato pizza. But this was a flavorless flatbread. \n\nAlso got the shaved asparagus salad. I'm as open as the next guy to eating dishes that are only one color, and I had high hopes for this all-green salad (arugula, peas, asparagus). Unsurprisingly, it was bland. \n\nMy coworkers ordered pizza. My boss, a well-traveled professional, opened his box to reveal a  margherita pizza (a simple dish to say the least) with small amounts of lackluster toppings on grilled bread. Another ordered a mushroom pizza that looked slimy.\n\nPerhaps had we gone out to eat at the proper restaurant, the food would have been hotter, and a little more crisp. But there is no excuse for a lack of flavor, especially at this price point. \n\nI'm giving two stars because they offer delivery and have an inventive menu, but ultimately this is not a place that I will be going back to.", "author": "Ben S."}

It's in a very sketchy area that makes you feel like you must be lost until you find it, but as soon as you walk in you are transported to Italy. The pizza was very good! We also had the carpaccio which was only OK... Here's why.... We have always had carpaccio that just melts in your mouth and comes apart  very nicely with your fork. This carpaccio was very different. It was very sliced beef, but I don't think it was raw beef as it is usually. I think it was cured beef and had a texture more like prosciutto. We weren't expecting that. It was a little tough to eat compared to the types we had tried before. It did not melt in your mouth. All around a good experience though.", "author": "Audrey L."}

As other reviewers have previously expressed, reservations are strongly recommended, as there are only a few dozen seats, and waiting might be on the sidewalk outside due to the very small reception area. \n\nThe pinsas were really yummy looking, but being gluten-free diners, looking is all that we did. There are many other offerings available to the GF that would allow one to not even miss the pinsa. \n\nNot being really familiar with cured meats and cheeses offered, the formaggi e affetati a-la-carte was a bit intmidating, so we ordered the chef's selection, paired with a gluten-free baguette we purchased elsewhere, and were not disappointed with what was presented. \n\nThe sott'oli, house-made marinated vegetables in olive oil, garlic, chili, parsley and salt should not be missed. Crudo di asparagi, a salad of thinly shaved raw asparagus, arugula, and raw English peas was perfectly dressed in a lemony olive oil. The other salad we ordered was the carpaccio; the slightly saltiness of the meat was perfectly balanced with the pepperiness of the arugula and marinated mushroom salad atop it.\n\nLastly, leave room for dolci. Our waiter suggested the panna cotta as a good gluten-free option.  We found ourselves swirling spoonfuls of creamy, vanilla bean and anise flavored custard through the small pool of delish olive oil. Truly lovely flavors.\n\nThe waitstaff was attentive, without being obtrusive, and knowledgable with offerings to suggest good pairings of food and wine. \n\nWill definitely return.", "author": "Suzanne R."}

That may be my number one mantra. \n\nThe only thing that's easy here is...eating.\n\nTake Uber or take a cab; no parking & you don't want to be walking around here at night.  You don't even want to be walking around here in the daytime for that matter.  Actually, hell, I don't even like to DRIVE around here in the daytime...but I digress.\n\nRomance?  It's in an alley.  Like Bix.  Like Claude  (Cafe Claude, who opened Gitane, in the same alley...).  Incidentally, after having dinner here, we went to Bix for drinks...can you say perfect night?!\n\nFood?  They serve PINSA.  No other restaurant in San Francisco serves PINSA.  \n\nWhat is PINSA?  Simply, think pizza, only way better.  A fresh, light, clean crust.  Pizza, streamlined.  We were told by the owner, Gianluca, that despite everyone comparing their pinsa to pizza, the only thing the two actually have in common are the toppings.  \n\nApparently, it's all about that crust.\n\nFunny.  I've been saying that for years.\n\nHowever you define it, pinsa is friggin fabulous.\n\nThey only opened 9 1/2 weeks ago.  In that time, they have everyone going to the most unsavory neighborhood that is 6th & Market...& not even caring.  \n\nThe space is minimal & rustic.  No frills.  Thank God.  It has a sort of food hall feel, despite the small size.  The great Federico Fellini himself would want to film here.  I've read several reviews that said eating here reminded them of eating in Rome.  Enough said.\n\nWe started w the prosciutto & melon & the caprese salad.  The melon is organic.  It was divine.  Perfectly tender.  And sweet.  The best I've ever had.\n\nThe mozzarella in the caprese was also perfection.  Salty, crisp, smooth in all the right places. \n\nThe Porchetta.  I had to order it.  So should you.  Oh so tender & oh so crisp.  \n\n3 pinsas we ordered...Collatina, Maranella, & Quadraro.  \n\nThe Collatina...the freshest buffalo mozzarella, greens, & cherry tomato.  They put the toppings on after the crust is made.  So, the toppings are not cooked or even heated.  My friend Marla said it reminded her of the pizza she had when she lived in Rome.  Props, major...for that.\n\nThe Maranella.  Burrata, broccolini, & spicy pork sausage.  White sauce.  Delicioso.  Just please do it.  BUT!!!  If you only order one pinsa?  Then it HAS to be the Quadraro...\n\nThe Quadraro.  Wow.  The hands down Star.   Tomato, red onion, pancetta, & pecorino.  Really, ORDER THIS.  The red sauce was POETICALLY GOOD.  As in, they should bottle it good.  \n\nService?  Not perfect, but not far off.  I'm only saying this because my friend, Guido, (Marla's husband) made the comment...our waiter recommended a wine for us that wasn't Italian?!  What?!  He's right, though.  Dude, if you're gonna push something on the wine list here, push the Italian wines for chrisake.\n\nThere's only 12 tables.  And one of those is a large group table.

It's not pizza but \"pinsa\", which uses a flour made from three different types of grain. Rice is one of them, and I think that's what gives it a crispier texture. This means, when you're actually craving a pizza, Montesacro might not do it for you. If you're wanting chewy textured satisfying dough, you might want to go somewhere else.\n\nI was all about ordering whatever specialties they had, but asides from the Maranella, my friend wanted a margherita (he says it's the best way to judge a pizza place). And while the Maranella fell a little short of my expectations (the burrata did not come out as much as I had hoped), the margherita was even more average. It kinda felt like not enough of everything, tomato mozzarella or basil. And for a meal that left me still feeling hungry, the bill was pretty expensive.\n\nI still like this place for bringing something different to the neighborhood.

Why yes, yes I am, you jealous Marina and Pac Heights snobs. It's here in SoMa on Stevenson right around the corner from Dottie's True Blue Cafe. And if you expect the neighborhood has gentrified overnight, please remember to fasten your seat belt before returning to your home planet. It's still as cacophonous as ever, but step inside this establishment and you are in Rome near Piazza Navona just coming off your tangerine Vespa. Tall ceilings. Dark wooden cafe tables. Rustic teal chairs, two big ovens in the back encased in subway tile. Ciao, Marcello...Ciao, Sophia.\n\nThe owner is, no surprise, a Roman named Gianluca Legrottaglie, a partner at nearby 54 Mint and a genuinely nice guy as he came to each and every table to thank them for coming. Me included. And if you're wondering what a pinseria is. Well, it's like a pizzeria but not. Unlike pizza, pinsa is made of a mix of rice, soy and wheat flours imported from Rome, and it produces a crisper, flatbread-like crust after it spends mere minutes in the traditional brick oven that actually existed in this space for years unused. I just came on a whim as I usually reserve my pizza eating with Jamie W., but I found this place too hard to resist. The menu is pretty robust with marinated vegetables (sottoli), cheeses, salumi and salads present and accounted for (photo: http://bit.ly/1HvmJM5).\n\nI decided to start with the $10 Cavolo Nero Insalate, a baby kale salad with marinated anchovies, shaved pecorino and drizzled with an anchovy vinaigrette. It came with a bowl, and it was just delicious with the kale nicely massaged and the saltiness of the anchovy just right for the serving which was placed in a glass bowl (photo: http://bit.ly/1Dqr1hh). There are ten pinsas to choose from, and to my own surprise, I went for the healthiest one, the $16 San Lorenzo with tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant and bell peppers, which I was told was the vegan option, and the lightweight crust made it almost gluten-free. Presented on a regular-size platter, it was a rustic shape suitable for solitary diners without leftovers (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ptteju).\n\nIt was absurdly delicioso and fresh tasting with all the vegetables strewn on the top in strips and the crispiness of the crust just right with the char. I didn't even miss the cheese because the fresh tomatoes provided all the lubrication I needed with each bite. It's billed as \"low-fat, low-calorie and easy to digest\" which only made me want to try the other nine pinsas. Some of them looked gorgeous as they passed by. I must have really thought I was in Rome because I decided to have an Espresso (photo: http://bit.ly/1Hze6OW) and the $7 Crostata di Visciole, a slice of the wild cherry tart dusted with powdered sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/1QqOUOH). A tasty treat, and Gianluca was right. You don't feel overstuffed at the end. I didn't want to leave though that had more to do with going back into the land of sirens and unprovoked screaming.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...never had pinsa before and now I'm hooked...what a delicious way to eat a healthier pizza\nAMBIANCE - 5 stars...like a Roman oasis amid the guerilla warfare on Sixth Street\nSERVICE - 5 stars...staff is great, very attentive and Gianluca is my paisan\nTOTAL - 5 stars...such a welcome addition to a neighborhood that really needs a unique eatery like a pinseria", "author": "Ed U."}

The rose was the server's suggestion.

The underside was crisp and just strong enough to hold the weighty vegetable toppings of broccoli rabe, beautiful crushed tomato, mushroom, and roasted red bell pepper. The ingredients went well together; the pie was perfectly cooked. \n\nI can't give this place a five because it was pretty loud and echo-ey.

The Cavolo Nero (kale, with pecorino cheese and anchovy vinaigrette) will explode any notion you have of tasteless, boring kale salads from other places.

But, after having pinsa (which isn't the same as pizza) at Montesacro, it's absolutely something I'm willing to add to list. I don't pretend to know or understand the difference between pinsa and pizza, but honestly, the food here is good enough to where I know I'm willing to come back and try it again to figure it out.\n\nMy husband and I were fed up with Thanksgiving leftovers and decided that we needed something that looked nothing like turkey and sweet potatoes.  Montesacro had been on my To Try list for awhile now, and knowing that the day after Thanksgiving usually means that restaurants aren't always open, we went with what was available in Montesacro. We made a reservation for dinner and much to my surprise, this place was PACKED.  After perusing through the menu by our server (who was just as authentic and Italian as the decor and ingredients), we decided to go with the Pecorino Calabrese Riserva cheese and Finocchiona Salumi to start, and shared the Margherita and Maranella Pinsas. For two (very) hungry adults, this was definitely the right amount of food to share. Between the two pinsas, I definitely loved the Margherita.  The Maranella was good, and if you like spicy, this is definitely one you should consider.  It was a little too spicy for me, but I know my husband loved it.\n\nService wise, dinner moved at a fairly slow pace.  I know we shouldn't always be in a hurry to eat, but when pinsas are being dished out right behind you and you can't wait to dig into the delicious looking flatbread that's been slathered in sauce, cheese and toppings, it's hard to not want your food ASAP.  Some people complain about the fact that the pinsa doesn't come pre-sliced, but honestly, what's wrong with working for your food just a little bit?  I loved our entire meal here, and will absolutely brave all the craziness and weirdos that 6th/7th Street & Market has to offer for dinner at Montesacro.", "author": "Lisa I."}

They were light, the ingredients were fresh, though in our opinion, nothing really blew us away. And while we're talking about pinsas, which apparently use a different combination of flour than regular pizza, my partner and I were still kind of iffy since pinsa basically just tastes like thin-crust pizza. I wasn't a huge fan that there were several burnt portions.

There is no easy way to get to this place so I had to take a Lyft from my meeting downtown and then walk through several blocks of human stench composed of shit, urine, and people who have not bathed or washed their clothes in years. \n\nAfter all that effort, I showed up, and waited while the hostess was engaged in a social dialog with 4 tourists, discussing every detail of their day. This went on, and on, and on, and on. The topics kept changing. The conversation never ended. I waited, and waited, and waited, patiently. The hostess never once took her eyes off these folks and acknowledged me. While I was waiting, more people arrived, then more, then, more, and eventually there was a line forming out the door. It was 5:00pm and the restaurant was nearly empty. Only 2 tables had guests at them. That hostess just would not budge, would not acknowledge or serve anyone. Finally, I interrupted this conversation and politely asked if I could be seated and she gave me an attitude like I'd committed the most horrific crime imaginable.

Eventually, I was seated. \n\nThe guy behind the bar was even worse. The whole time I was there, he had is back to me, and two other guests who were seated just before me.

While he was doing this, 3 other servers walked past us at the bar, and completely avoided all eye contact.

The dough was absolutely delicious, thin, crisp, but lightly doughy around the crust, literally cooked to perfection. I think the pizza could have used garlic, along with finishing of olive oil and sea salt. Overall the food was yummy and I'll definitely be back to try some other pizzas on the menu.", "author": "Adriana G."}

Tucked away on Stevenson St, you can almost escape the weight of the 'Loin and feel like you're in an old world Italian village sampling vibrant tastes of history.\n\nPinsa: the primordial pizza dough made with a unique combination of high-protein, high-soy, high-rice flour and just a touch of olive oil. It makes for a lighter, crisper, lower-carb, and overall more digestible pizza base.\n\nTry the Quardraro (tomato, red onion, pancetta, pecorino) and the Maranella (burrata, broccolini, spicy pork sausage).  The former is a perfect combination of textures and flavors against that unrivaled crust.  The latter is a meditation on spiciness on a bed or molten burrata.  \n\nWine selection is formidable, the staff the opposite.  Service was friendly and informed.

I came here with one my ex-boyfriend who is from Italy (born and raised), and has a high standard for pizza and it passed his test. This is now on my list of favorite pizza places in San Francisco (I have gone to Flour + Water, Del Popolo, Una Pizza Neopalitana, Il Casaro, Pizzeria Delfina), and I think this one will become my new go-to-pizza spot from now on. I almost wish I hadn't come here with my ex because now this will remind me of him, but it's so good that I'll come back over and over again. \n\nThe location is a bit gritty, located on 6th St. Once you turn on 6th St, you'll want to walk very briskly / run - not just because you're anxious to eat good pizza, but because you'll want to escape all the crazies in the area. But it's worth dodging all the sketchiness of the area to come here. When you come inside, it's a warm, friendly place that makes you feel like you stepped inside somewhere in Italy. The owner is really nice and came over and talked to us several times and explained the difference between the pizzas that they make here vs. other places. The dough is made up of different types of flours and leavens for 2-3 days. The type of pizza they make is typical of Rome, vs. the other neopolitana pizzas that come from the South of Italy, or the thinner crust from the North.\n\nBresaola salami (3-4 pieces for $6), and it was delicious. It tasted like high-quality salami, without all the fat.\n\nCollatina ($16) - Buffalo Mozzarella, Rucolo, and Cherry Tomato. This was delicious with big chunks of buffalo mozzarella (no heavy cheese on top of tomato sauce at this place), a generous serving of arugula, and cherry tomatoes. It almost felt like a salad on top of fresh pizza dough. If you love arugula, get this - it's so good and makes you feel slightly healthier because of the arugula.\n\nQuadraro ($17) - Tomato, Red Onion, Pancetta and Pecorino - This has basically tomato sauce, bacon, and a small amount of cheese. Don't expect anything super cheesy, but for me, it was the right amount of everything and you could really taste the pizza dough.\n\nWe also shared a cherry crostata which was just okay, and a bit on the sweet side for me. I wanted to try the Pinsa Nutella, which is basically pizza crust with Nutella (how can you go wrong?) but decided I had had enough carbs for the day.\n\nThis is a much better value than Una Pizza Neopolitana which at $25 a pop (excluding tip and tax) is just highway robbery for pizza, and without trying to hunt down a food truck (Del Popolo) or waiting for an ungodly amount of time (Pizzeria Delfina, Flour + Water). I like that you can make reservations here ahead of time, and that everything is reasonably priced. This is now my favorite pizza place in the city - I waver between telling too many people because I want to make sure I can go whenever I want! I love the two flavors of pizza that I tried and look forward to trying the rest of the menu.", "author": "Christina L."}

Not so...\n\nI will start by saying that the drinks were 5-star.  My red blend was excellent and the hubby got a spanish cider unlike anything we've tried before.  But that's about where the ratings dropped.  The service was incredibly slow.  We had a reservation, and so were seated promptly, but it was a busy time of night and so we had to wait 15min to put in a drink order and another 15min to get our food order taken.  The food, thankfully, came fast, though the check did not- a 30min game of trying to catch the eye of passing waiters (and we were in the middle of the restaurant, so I can't imagine how slow it might have been in a back corner...)\n\nThe different pinserias we ordered were definitely let-downs.  I'm not sure what I expected- this is the food that used to be served to the poor outside Rome so I probably shouldn't have had high expectations, but since this meal comes with a definitely non-peasant worthy $20+ price tag I definitely expected more for the price!  I was surprised by how tasteless the crust was, and all the edges were charred on my meal, so I had a plate of black crust scrapings after working my way through the dish.  One of the staff came by to talk to us about the dishes near the end of the meal, emphasizing how unique pinserias are, though his major selling point was the fact that it's better metabolized so you don't feel as full after the meal, like you do with pizza.  Well, he was certainly right, because I was still hungry after an entire pinseria!  We cleaned our plates and were still ravenous- and that with a hefty dinner bill!  I think I can see why this is the first pinseria place in the U.S., and something tells me that the dish won't be catching...", "author": "Sophia G."}

Based on very high Yelp ratings, we decided to try this place out, and book on Open Table to ensure we got a place to sit.\n\nSince it was our first time, we asked our waitress for some recommendations.

Especially from my Fianc\u00e9 who does not like eggplant at all really liked this dish!  Very tasty with all the different subtleties like the parsley, chili flakes and olive oil to help augment the lightly grilled eggplant.  I would recommend to try this.\n\nThe Rapette Insalate was also very good--  Think of it as a gourmet beet salad.  Again, we're not really beet folks, but both of us enjoyed this lightly dressed salad  with beets, farmer's greens, sunflower seeds, goat cheese and chives.  \n\nNow to the main event-- The Maranella Pinsa.  The Pinsa is a very light, flatbread that's much less dense than a traditional pizza crust.  It was crunchy on the outside and a little fluffy on the inside--  It was topped with Burrata cheese, Broccolini and a spicy pork sausage.  The combination of the seemingly weightless crust and the ingredients melding together made for a very enjoyable and tasty flatbread-- I'd definitely recommend to try :)   (Also on a side note, the spicy sausage was not overwhelmingly spicy, it was just hot enough for a slight kick)\n\nService was great, our waitress and I believe the owner checked up on us regularly.  \n\nWhile we didn't have enough time to try their desserts (the show was starting in 15 mins), we'll certainly going to come back again!\n\nIt's located right around the corner from Dottie's, which makes that two great places to eat in the same neighborhood-- I just wish the neighborhood caught up with how awesome this place is!", "author": "Anthony R."}

Pinsa is pizza. The wait staff will tell you that it is not pizza, and technically they are correct, but to your average joe it is a $17 loaf of flatbread with a couple vegetables and way too much cheese in the middle (a not enough cheese on the crusts). A poorly-tossed oval pizza with toppings strewn about. PINSA. \n\nOn the other hand, the appetizer platter for $22 was a good deal split among three people and paired well with the wine we ordered.

Decent pizza but not worth the hype..\n\nAnchovy pizza: 3 stars -- my friend got the anchovy pizza which looked and tasted very similar to mine, but a shit ton saltier. The flavor fell flat for me, maintaining only the one salty note throughout. \n\nOverall, disappointing experience. Might give it another try in a bigger group setting so I can try their meat and cheese plates and a few other dishes.", "author": "Michelle K."}

I've heard it's quite popular with the Zendesk crowd at lunch so try and come on the early side. I came with a friend from Zendesk and he kept waving throughout lunch as his coworkers filed in.\n\nWe started out with the prosciutto - the good stuff. Soft, delicate, fatty and delicious. Not that dried chewy stuff you get at the supermarket deli. This was followed by two pinsas - the Infernetto ($17 smoked buffalo mozzarella, 'nduja) and Quadraro ($17 tomato, red onion, pancetta, pecorino). Pinsas are like thin crust pizzas but the crust is more yeasty and chewy. It's crisped up enough to eat by hand but delicate enough to eat with a fork/knife if that's your preference. The topping is pretty light but rich. The infernetto was a white pizza with a nice smokiness from the mozzarella and spiciness from the 'nduja. I thought it was great. The Quadraro was more standard tomato sauce but still fresh tasting and good.\n\nThough the pinsas are personal sized I wasn't able to finish mine. \n\nDefinitely a diamond in the rough and possibly the star restaurant of the neighborhood.", "author": "Jean K."}

I have seen many California style flatbread pizza's but none that I felt 'put the place on the map'.  So I had my doubts but said I would try the place one day. \n\nA month later we had tickets to 'Act of God' and went here for dinner.  When you walk-in the place has a great old tile floor that leads into a concrete floor which I found interesting.  I asked our server about and she said it used to be a real working Bakery and pointed to the two HUGE old wood fired ovens in the back.  I hadn't noticed them because I was distracted by the cheese case which is just in front that had these massive wheels of very handsome looking cheeses.  The rest of the interior is intimate and casual with wine bottles on the walls from all over - Italy, Spain... as well as some ciders and beers.  \n\nThe seating was comfortable and informal but casual and the staff was very knowledgeable about the wines, the beers, and the foods.  They were also very relaxed and at no point in our 2 hours (I was amazed we spent that much time but we talking and sipping most of the time) did we ever feel rushed.\n\nThe food was simple with lots of flavors with perfect sized portions for the 3 of us.  We started with the PORCHETTA FATTA IN CASA (Slow roasted Pork),  a CAVOLO NERO (Kale Salad) and charcuterie.  It came with a cherry jelly and honey 2 cheeses, Salami and spicy sausage (I wish I could remember which ones but I can't).   We then had two PINSA's the INFERNETTO and RABIBBATA (Wild Boar sausage I think this is seasonal).  \n\nThe Pinsa's came out on a rustic dough that big bubbles, a nice crunch and some charring on the bubbles.  The dough was perfectly seasoned with salt (you'd be amazed how many dough's are bland) The toppings from the wild boar to the nudja were packed with a so much flavor but not heavy and not too much.  Each bite was so good.  \n\nWe had several glasses of wine during our meal and I had a dessert wine as well.  I can't wait to go back and try some more options in the future.", "author": "Scott S."}

Even better than Baonecci's, Tony's, etc.\n\nTHE MARGHERITA pinsa (Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil) gets 5 stars. So simple, so good. The Corviale pinsa (Buffalo Mozzarella, Porcini Mushroom, Lardo, Parsley) was double the price and not nearly as amazing as the former.\n\nOnly difference between this and Roman pizza is that they're slightly heavier on the cheese here, which is understandable given American preferences, but I'd say go for more sauce, less cheese, and let the impeccable crust shine. Because it's impeccable.\n\nAs for the formaggi - out of the selection of cheeses/meats we ordered, the STRACCHINO - \"Delizie Casearie\" Puglia-Italy was the best. The jam it's paired with *works*. The crostini with housemade veggies was alright, filling. Next time, I'd skip it. \n\nAs a mostly gluten-free diner (not Celiac), this place was perfect. The crust is made from mainly non-wheat flours, and the small amount of wheat flour they do use is friendly: non-GMO and Italian.\n\nWith the Austrian red wine by the glass (really good) and some smooth espressos, we're talking a European-style blissed-out meal. That usually means way-better-than-here. But not anymore! :D", "author": "Maria A."}

That being said, I do assume that the rave reviews are for a reason and given how close it is to where I live, I do plan to give it a second shot.\n\nFirst time I tried to come here, it was a week night and fairly crowded. I tried again a few days later when I was working from home and needed to eat lunch. At lunch time, it was not too busy at all (I don't remember exactly but I think it was a little after normal lunch hours, maybe 1:30). \n\nTried to start with the eggplant sottoli (marinated eggplant) but they were out so I got zucchini instead. I found it to be very underseasoned and oily. It just needed a lot more salt and a lot more flavor in general. I would like to try the eggplant if they have that in the future, and a few of their salads look interesting as well. \n\nFor pinsa (not pizza!), I ordered the Maranella- burrata, pork sausage, and it was supposed to come with broccolini but I think they were out so they used broccoli. The broccoli was not good (it was also not cooked very well)- I think broccolini would have been so much better and I wish they'd told me about this substitution because I would have asked them to leave off the broccoli and/or substitute another vegetable. The pinsa as a whole was alright, but I was not a huge fan and I think the ingredients just didn't complement each other well. The best part of it was definitely the burrata. It was very big and pretty filling though- should be enough for 2 people, especially if you get it with an appetizer or one of the cheeses or meats on the menu. I tried the biscotti for dessert as well; it was alright but again, nothing special. I should have probably tried one of the chocolate desserts though, so this was my bad. \n\nNot the best first impression but I am definitely willing to give it another try and order something else. Hopefully the second time will be better and I will understand why people love this spot so much.", "author": "Seema U."}

Each platter is a good size for ~3 people. The radicchio salad was just okay, although I don't think it was a good idea to share it among 8 of us. \n\nThe pinsas, however, were really good. Out of the five we got, three were memorable: Maranella (burrata, broccolini, and spicy pork sausage), Carviale (buffalo mozzarella, porcini mushrooms), and Trullo (tomato, lamb sausage, mushroom, yogurt sauce). The crust was light and chewy, but supported the toppings well.\n\nService (5/5): Amazing service - our waiter was friendly and hospitable without being overbearing, and he had some great recommendations for us. The restaurant was also accommodating of our lactose-intolerance friends!\n\nValue (3/5): As solid as the food was, I think the prices are a bit on the higher side, especially for the quantity of food you get.

Was in the Union Square area and was looking for a good restaurant to satisfy my hunger and I came upon this place. After reading just a couple of reviews, I was convinced and headed down to the sketchy 6th street. Right as we approached the restaurant, I could smell the aromas of the freshly bakes Pinsas and I couldn't wait to eat.\n\nWe ordered a couple of glasses of Italian wine - nothing looked too familiar on the menu so we just asked our server for recommendations. The only thing that was really important about this meal were the Pinsas - they were delicious! When you first look at the menu as a Vegetarian, it looks like most of them have meat, but they are very accommodating and will substitute meats for veggies if you ask! We ordered the Centocelle without the prosciutto and Maranella substituting the sausage for eggplant. My favorite of the two was the Centocelle - all the veggies and egg mixed with the flavorful red sauce created a perfect dish which I would definitely recommend! The Maranella was good, but not amazing. In my opinion, it didn't have as much flavor as the other one, but the sausage probably makes it better. 2 pinsas was just the right amount of food for 2 famished people. One interesting thing is the pinsas don't come cut into pieces; instead, you have to cut them yourself with a pizza cutter that is provided. \n\nWe were unbelievably full after eating the pinsa, but we didn't want to stop there. We ended up ordering the buidino for dessert and it was PERFECT! Best end to a great meal!! \n\nCome here for a hole-in-the-wall-ish dining experience!

The music, the foot/leg work, everything was impressive.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and Riverdance just happens to be touring in SF for their 20th anniversary at the SHN Golden Gate Theater.  I decided to drag along my husband since he's never seen it before, and I made a reservation at Montesacro since it was right around the corner from the show.\n\nDue to the massive traffic jam that is San Francisco on a Friday night, we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation; I called to let them know, and they said no problem.  We were seated once we got there, but it took awhile for our order to get taken because there was a large party taking their sweet time, and it seems like there were only two waitstaff that night.\n\nWe ordered two pinseras - Margherita for me, Maranella for Husband (broccolini, sausage, burrata), along with a cheese and charcuterie plate.  Everything was really delicious, though I was expecting the pizza-like dough to be a little thinner and crisper - a pinsera is branded as a flatbread, and ours were neither flat nor crispy.  Also, my Margherita (which is my FAVORITE type of pizza ever) had some spots where the salt obviously missed, as the tomato sauce was bland, but then there were some sections that seemed to be a little oversalted.  Generally great though - my husband rated Montesacro higher than Pizzetta and Zero Zero (his favorite is still Tony's).\n\nService is amazing; really friendly and personable.  However, be forewarned that this doesn't translate to quick and speedy - if you're in a rush, your best bet would be to go somewhere quick-service, because that's not the nature of this place.

The 2 star review is because of an incident that happened while we were eating that was not handled very well by the staff. \n\nA homeless woman wandered into the restaurant and approached our table twice (we were close to the door). The first time we asked her to leave and when she didn't, she was eventually escorted out. The second time she came right up to us, aggressively grabbed a beer bottle off our table and drank from it; upon realizing the bottle was empty she grabbed a glass of water and drank from that. My friend asked her to stop and tried to get the attention of someone who could ask her to leave. \n\nIt was startling to say the least and it could have been handled better. It's obviously not the restaurant's fault that this happened but they didn't even acknowledge it to our table or attempt to prevent this woman from entering the restaurant until after she came in for the second time and helped herself to our beverages. It seemed unusual to me that the staff didn't say anything AT ALL to our table regarding this after it happened and just carried on as if it was a totally normal occurrence. It makes me think that these types of things must happen frequently....", "author": "Jessica C."}

I need for this place to stay open for a long time so I can keep getting my fix on pinsas. \n\nMy wife and I went here yesterday, and we will soon be returning. We live in the neighborhood, so we knew where to walk on 6th. Once we got inside the restaurant and sat down, we both felt like we had been teleported out of the TL into some magical kingdom of yumminess. The smells of Montesacro can be noticed from around the corner, and as you approach, it just gets better. We had done our research, so we knew all about the \"pinsas\", but we were not prepared for how delicious they were. \n\nWe started off with a watermelon, basil, feta salad that was perfectly refreshing on a warm afternoon. We followed with the leanest bresaola (think prosciutto but made of beef tenderloin) and the creamiest manchego. The bresaola only came with three pieces, and the manchego wasn't exactly a healthy slice. In retrospect, we should have listened to our waiter and gone with the bresaola carpaccio. The table next to us ordered it and it looked amazing. They also ordered the caprese salad which looked to be a healthy serving as well.\n\nThen, ohhhhh, then came out the pinsa. You can be a brat and call it a pizza, but the difference is truly the crust. A combination of wheat, soy, and rice, it tasted so much lighter to me than pizza dough. We went with the Montesacro pinsa and I confess that I was thrown at first by the ingredients. Straciatella, kale, fermented fish sauce. I had no idea what straciatella was, kale...meh, and fermented fish..forget it. We asked the waiter, he said it was his favorite. Sure it is...fermented what now? \"it's deceiving, you can't even taste fish\" sure, buddy.  But what is straciatella? \"It's the center of buratta.\" So basically, you take little pillows of heaven - buratta - that you extract their inner essence of deliciousness, and throw that on your dough to serve as a sauce. I don't care what they fermented, I was getting that pizza.\n\nTo wrap this up, one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten - hands down the best pinsa I've ever eaten (also the only one). My wife woke up this morning, and instead of saying \"good morning, my love\" she said \"can we have another pinsa for breakfast\"? The answer was no, because she wouldn't let me buy one for the road, so there.", "author": "David C."}

Unfortunately there is no one who works the bar full time, so if you're sitting there, expect to have to flag down a server. (The servers were incredibly kind and attentive once they realized I'd been overlooked, for the record). However, it's more of that European style of dining, where the servers are not overly attentive, but happy to help you out when you flag them down. Just don't expect that putting an empty glass at the edge of the bar will bring them over.\n\nDespite the lag in service, this may be the most delicious meal I've had all year (aside from a sailing trip around Greece). I had 2 kinds of wine, the gruner veltliner and pinot grigio, both delicious. The pinot grigio was especially nice, despite being more of a rose. The marinated artichokes, olives and zucchini were scrumptious - had to order a second round of artichokes. The beet salad with greens, goat cheese and pistachios was a very generous size, and very delicious. The flatbread with squash and speck was the perfect combination of salty and sweet. The Italian bacon on it was much more delicious than the usual American bacon. The bread was to die for (both the flatbread, and the dinner bread), and I'm not even a \"bread\" person. I could not stop eating the bread here. It's so soft and warm and tasty. Yum and a double thumbs up! \n\nThe ambiance is nice, though the restaurant was quite warm, due to the ovens.

The crust has a subtle crunch to it. The dough is just perfect: it's flavourful, has got a slight sourdough taste, with a thick border and just the right amount of chewy. You can tell it's leavened slowly and to perfection. This makes it delicious to eat (even alone, without condiments), but also easy to digest.\n\nThe ingredients. Those are the best of the best. I had a \"Maranella\" with burrata, broccolini, spicy pork sausage. Everything was so fresh and authentic.\n\nThe location. The place used to be a bakery some 100 years ago.

This place had a good atmosphere albeit it is in kinda a rough area, although I had no problem with it my friends from out of town were worried. Anyway, these are essentially flat bread pizzas that are well made and also very authentic. It seemed like it took hardly anytime at all for them to cook  them up, which I also appreciated due to somewhat inebriated state. We had the infernetto (smoked buffalo mozzarella and a spicy pork spread) it seemed very light but not in a bad way, more like a easy on the stomach type feeling. The quality of ingredients and the way they prepared the pinsa was like nothing I've had before, unique in its styling and presentation. Being that we also had a couple drinks, one pinsa did not suffice and we ended up getting a margherita as well because it is usually a staple of any good pizza place and it did not disappoint.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-22", "description": "What a wonderful new restaurant! I have always enjoyed 54 Mint, so when I heard that one of the folks behind that place was opening a new one, I had to check it out. Our host was the charming, effervescent Gianluca. Kudos to him for opening this restaurant, which pays homage to his childhood in Italy and memories of its food. \n\nWe started with a well-curated mixed cheese/salumi plate, as well as an order of the house-made porchetta. Gianluca recounted for us how he and his family would travel to the outskirts of Rome on weekends, and stop at food trucks that roasted a whole pig . . . And out of those trucks came the most delicious, thinly sliced porchetta. His aim is to recreate that porchetta - I can't vouch for how it compares to his childhood, but the one I ate was fabulous! (It is served like a salumi - at room temperature.)\n\nWe moved on to two pinsas (shared between three people). We had the spicy Infernetto - which packed a whollop of heat - and the more delicate Collatina. Both were excellent. The crust is puffy like Neapolitan, which was a surprise, because I understood \"Roman\" pizza to be cracker-thin. But Gianluca explained that his pinsas are made from three different flours, and although they have a thicker crust, the dough ends up very light. I agree, these crusts were fluffy and airy.\n\nThe wine list is interesting and well priced. Italian focused (naturally), but with some California and other locales sprinkled in. At the end of the meal, Gianluca poured us another splash of red wine so we could dunk some \"ciambelline all'olio e vino\" - a semi-sweet round biscotti made with olive oil and glazed with white wine. A perfect ending to the meal for me, as I don't generally order sweet desserts.\n\nOne potentially negative aspect of dining here will be navigating the Tenderloin to get there. Not a big deal for me, since I live in SoMa and know what I'm in for, but tourists and others not familiar with the \"charm\" of 6th Street may be put off. \n\nThis is a terrific addition to the casual dining scene south of Market - I'll be back again soon.", "author": "Maureen O."}

My sister became unhappy because she said she could smell, sorry, no way to be delicate, human excrement. I could not smell anything, but we moved to a new table more interior. This table was in direct line to front door and whenever the door opened we could both smell it. Even worse, the woman at the next table was loaded with perfume, which makes me sick. We moved again, way inside, near kitchen, so it was hot but what can you do? I felt sorry for the restaurant staff working hard while someone was using the street as a latrine. However, it filled up later (which reduced the odor as fans came on) so people are coming regardless.\n\nOK, to the meal. The 50% of DNA that my sister and I share is apparently not the part that governs food tastes; we frequently don't like the same thing which can be a problem in a share-oriented restaurant. Settled on beef carpaccio as appetizer, very good. I recommend highly. After LONG debate got two pinsas to split, one with mushrooms and lardo, the other with lamb sausage. The mushrooms had a consistency that did not appeal to me but the lamb was quite good. Meal pretty filling due to being heavily bread based.\n\nThey lose a point by not serving tea.

I had considered coming back alone for lunch and sitting at the window table, but not if I have to carry tea from Starbucks!\n\nFor dessert she got the chocolate mousse and I got the cake.

It went great with the meal.\n\nWe wanted to eat light so we went with one appetizer and one pinsa. It was enough for that night, though in the future I think we'll order one pinsa each. We got the olives for an appetizer, and they were great as expected. The oil on the olives was particularly good and it was great to dip the pinsa crust into.\n\nWe ordered a margherita pinsa since it was our first time here and we wanted to get an idea for the cooking process. Pinsa dough is like a flatbread, but it's baked with attention and care. Typically when I think of flatbread I think \"rustic\", or homemade, which I can do in my own oven. But Montesacro has big beautiful ovens and they use them aptly. The dough was light and fluffy on the inside, with a thin crispy layer on the outside. The crust was lightly charred with no areas being completely burned - perfect in my opinion. The texture was course - I originally thought there was cornmeal in the dough, but it turned out to be grainy flour. I liked it because it gave the dough an extra crunch but didn't affect the flavor. The toppings were tasty and fresh, particularly the mozzerella which tasted like milk. The basil they used was delicious, however there wasn't much of it. That's my only complaint, I believe I only got 4 or 5 bites with basil in them - I would've liked more. I don't have much to say about the sauce other than it wasn't very acidic. I generally like all red sauces though.\n\nI'm glad we got to visit this place before it gets popular. I was surprised to see it wasn't on sf.eater's list of up-and-coming pizza spots. Being on an alley off of 6th, I could see how it might be overlooked. Despite the surrounding gritty neighborhood, Montesacro was clean, secluded, and the scent of pinsa and wine filled the air. I will definitely come back and have more pinse!", "author": "Jimmie T."}

I also get their chocolate mousse for dessert, and it is the bomb! Their salads are simple, but fresh. I  have only good things to say about this place, and not because I'm their neighbor (believe me, if I could keep this place to myself, I would.), but because I am a food snob, and they pass the test with flying colors.

We started with marinated vegetables, but the best plates we got were the prosuitto and melon and buffalo mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad. The show stopper was their pinsa which is unlike any pizza like concoction I've ever had. Like a flatbread but with a fluffy crunchy crust. Absolutely amazing with broccolini and spicy sausage.

We also got the beet salad and the portion was small as well.   \n\nSeating can also be an issue there- they have communal table that we had no choice but to sit at because there were no other available seats though we had a reservation.  The metal stools were uncomfortable so see if you can specify when you make a reservation.  The server was apologetic they could not give us another table and the service was generally good.  The street it's on, coming from 6th or 7th (esp. 6th) can be a bit sketchy.

We wanted to sit altogether to have lunch amid the bustling event. I was in charge of making this happen. In practice we would have a bit over 1 hour inside the restaurant, so it was utterly important that everything was prearranged and swift.\n\nA week before the event I talked on the phone with Ms. Giulia from the restaurant, and she was thoroughly kind. She took upon herself all the work of organizing a fixed price per person lunch, as I said I preferred, of selected items from the menu. I didn't know the menu so I just trusted her to make everyone happy about the food.\n\nWe arrived on the scheduled time, were greeted by the very owner of the place, and were seated at the wide communal table plus one more table. Very few minutes after we sat, the waiters started bringing food in a deliciously orchestrated sequence of cheeses, breads, salads, fine charcuterie, and then the glorious pinsas which are similar to pizzas but better. The lunch also included one soft drink per person, and they have truly authentic soft drinks there!\n\nEveryone was delighted with the food and the communal experience of not having to choose individual dishes. We simply ate altogether from the foods on the table and chatted all along. \"An Italian family lunch experience\". The stress of the conference disappeared inside the restaurant. At my request, while we ate the waiters slowly proceeded with charging each guest the fixed price of the lunch, which already included taxes and gratuity. When our time was up, the bill was already paid, the full receipt was already in my hands, so we simply thanked everyone and left. Not a single precious minute was wasted with waiting!\n\nI sincerely thank Montesacro for making every effort to maximize our time, minimize my stress as the organizer of the \"event\", and deliver a lunch that was super enjoyable not only for the superb food but also for its familial, communal style. The price we paid was also very fair, even more if considering how expensive San Francisco is.\n\nNow I have a problem: it was a big success so my colleagues will want me to be again the person organizing our lunch in the Conference next year! :)\n\nHighly recommended restaurant!", "author": "Fabricio P."}

So I have upgraded from 2 to 3 stars. In order therefore:\nRestaurant ambience: 1 Star. Acoustics of the room are terrible so it is difficult to have a conversation or hear your server. The area is horrid, so it is not a nice place to get into or out of. The decor is fine, but sound protectors / dampers would help out no end. I also felt like the decor was confused - at one end, it looks like a high-end restaurant (albeit with exposed concrete around the pipes) and at the other like a grocery shop. My preference is to have one theme in a restaurant.\nRestaurant service: 2 stars. Could have been more forthcoming and friendly than it was.\nFood: 3 stars. Sott'oli (mushrooms, tomatoes, courgettes), Formaggi (brie), Mandiare Pinsa. Pinsa is just pizza, not a new type of pizza. I took issue with that description. Pinsa comes from the Latin pinsere. Vegetables sottolio were fine - the portion was generous BUT the were not infused with the oil; the oil had just been poured over at the end, and I didn't think it was the best quality olive oil I had ever had. The vegetables should have been marinaded in the oil.\nThe brie was good although I hated the presentation (with two tiny teaspoons of honey and blueberry compote - make them decent sized accompaniments or don't provide them).\nThe pinsa was fine - a generous hand with the radicchio was appreciated. However (and this is nothing to do with the restaurant, more with other reviewers) this is NOT a thin crust pizza. It is a pillowy base, more the thickness of a naan than a thin crust pizza.

Based on the Yelp reviews we decided to give it a try.  The location is down a side street in a not so good part of town but if you can get past that, you will be happy you did.  We were greeted and served by a warm & welcoming lady.  The food was delicious.  We tried 2 types of Pinsa type pizza, caprese, and a sliced pork called porchetta.  Everything was high quality and authentic.  As we left, the lady hugged us and thanked us. We felt like 'regulars'.  What a great find!

Though the restaurant is tucked away in a well lit alley, the environment changes drastically even 300 ft from the door. The food is delightful -- light, fresh, flavorful,  and authentically Italian. The environment too; lively, joyful, and busy. The service is very poor, slow and inconsistent (we had four different severs throughout the meal). Much like the crowd that fills it, this restaurant sticks out like a sore thumb. Is the food worth the palpable feeling of sore thumbedness? Not in my opinion.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

Seemed almost seedy, and I was a little uncomfortable parking or walking in the alley.  But once we set foot into the restaurant, the environment changed.  The decor was more or less what you would see in a lot of SF restaurant: smaller, more intimate space, high ceiling, got an air of the old and whimsy to it thanks to the collection of vintage kitchen tools and what-not's.  But it didn't feel pretentious.  Probably because the staff was friendly.  Food was excellent.  The whole experience reminded of my boyfriend of his experience in Italy, which said a lot.  We each ordered a pinsa, and we shared the prosciutto-wrapped cantaloupe.  That appetizer was delightful.  I've had it in other nicer restaurant, and somehow it never came out quite as good.

We went during happy hour and had two glasses of wine for the price of one, woo hoo!  We got a little plate of three prepared vegetables: dried tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini.  Tasty, but not essential, especially for $12.  Get to the pinsa!  We split two among three of us, which seemed just about right.  We had the Maranella (burrata, spicy sausage, broccolini) and it was very savory (could use a little more toppings; we also had the Collatina (mozzarella, arugula, cherry tomato, served uncooked on top of the crust)and this was okay, but not a special thing - you can do better.

This is definitely not a \"pizza place.\"  \nFirst a call out to our waiter - Murphy.  We had a group of 10, and he gave us the most attentive service I've ever had for a large group!  He refilled glasses of wine and water regularly -- better service than I sometimes get with just two people.  Nothing bothered him.  Mahalo Murphy! \nThis was a great place for a group, perhaps a bit noisy for a couple.  The pinsa are varied and amazing.  All were delicious (and we tried most of them!).  Antipasto selection is excellent, especially anything and everything with the mozzarella (OMG!).  Deserts were small but yummy.  One option is an Italian style biscotti with a special dunking wine (I think).\nNote:  We had a Tuscan Italian in our group, and she gave the thumbs up on a truly crisp crust.  \nReasonably priced wine selections.  \nGroup table is on bar stools but no one in our group had a problem with this.\nAs others have said, this place is not in the best neighborhood but don't let that stop you.  We walked from Powell Muni/BART.  Others parked at 5th/Mission garage.\nEveryone in our group said they are likely to return when in SF.\nPrice could be less than $30/person.

You can expect it all at Montesacro: warm welcome, cool decor, wonderful ambiance, extensive wine list, and a first-class an unusual menu. There are many Italian lite restos in SF...this is not lite, it's THE REAL DEAL. Start with the sott'oli, divine, especially the tomatoes. We ordered a glass of sparkling red, which was delicious. An a bottle of red, which was well-priced and excellent. Then after much conversation and fun with the owner, Gianlucca, we ordered 3 pinsa. The only disagreement was which one of us had ordered best. The dough is unlike anything you've had before, it's crispy and light, and a perfect base. The toppings are fresh and well-thought out. Given the size, we figured we would need at least 2 take-out boxes. No...we ate everything. And given we were headed to the SFIFF to see Del Toro, this is saying a lot as we were going to be sitting for at least 3 hours after. I'm changing reservations for some company events to move them to Montesacro. So run, don't walk to get your res here, you will love it. The bar opens son for Happy Hour, and we will be there too. Don't let the hood put you off, it's right on the corner of Stevenson, and we know this will be a well-worn and welcoming path. Thank you for the REAL Italian, we felt like were were on a piazza overlooking a fountain somewhere in Italy. This is as close as you will get to Italy in SF, enjoy, enjoy!", "author": "S S."}

Once you try Montesacro's pinsas you won't go back to pizza. Yes, their pinsas are that good. Crunchy yet light, thin yet bubbly, the kind of flavor that can finally culminate your quest for perfect pizza, and much more actually.\nWe tried Collatina (cherry tomato, arugula and buffalo mozzarella) and Margherita (just like the namesake pizza), both very good. Although the Collatina was my favorite. \nWe also tried an antipasto of sottoli: grilled eggplant, zucchini and sun-dried tomatoes in good olive oil. I hadn't had that good sottoli since I left Italy. It was a great way to start our meal.\nI thought prices were also reasonable, given the abundant quantity and excellent quality. We will definitely come back, and bring our friends, too. I look forward to try the other pinsas. This is a true diamond in the rough.

My boyfriend and I walked in without a reservation. Even though it was a very busy night for them, they managed to squeeze us in and promised us that our food would arrive quickly so we wouldn't be rushed to eat it. We wanted to get pizza, but we weren't sure if one or two pizzas would be enough food for us, so they recommended that we order one pizza and a platter with cheese and cured meats. They gave us bread to go with the meat and cheese, also. The cheese, meat, and bread were all so delicious. Then the pizza came. I can't remember what we ordered, but it had mozerralla cheese and mushrooms. The mushrooms were so good that they almost melted in our mouths, and the pizza crust was airy and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. It was honestly the best pizza I've ever had. On top of all of this, the place was beautifully decorated. If you are looking for pizza, look no further. I will definitely be coming back soon.", "author": "Mariana G."}
