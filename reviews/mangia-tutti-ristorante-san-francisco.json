The lasagna was pretty good, although being individually prepped, the edges of the noodles were dried/crispy. The sauce/ricotta ratio was good, but the portion was overall much smaller than expected, maybe only the size of your average iPhone (not plus).  The pappardelle was absolutely amazing, however.  The bolognese was quite flavorful, and it was cooked to perfection.\n\nAll in all, an easy place to stop at for basic Italian food.

We were craving some Italian food and happened to be in FiDi, so this placed looked like a good candidate just from the reviews we saw. The location is a little hard to find since the exterior is pretty unassuming, and it was totally empty when we first came in. Some large groups came in while we were eating and it livened up the atmosphere.\n\nOur server was a nice Italian man who was pretty attentive and answered any questions we had. My friends and I split the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and they got the quattro fromaggi pizza and spinach ravioli, while I had the spaghetti carbonara.\n\nBefore our food was served, we also got some bread and olive oil. I was a little bummed that our bread wasn't warm, but otherwise it was pretty standard. Our bruschetta was pretty standard as well, though I wish that the bread was a little more thin and more toasted.\n\nMy friend who had the spinach ravioli really enjoyed his dish, though he did wish that the portions size was a bit larger. My other friend enjoyed the quattro fromaggi at first, but since it was a white pizza, the lack of tomato sauce ended up making the dish pretty and salty after a while. He ended up taking the rest home with him but ended up tossing it while we were hanging out after dinner.\n\nMy spaghetti carbonara was also pretty good, but the cream sauce wasn't super smooth and it was a super rich dish. I guess that's to be expected of a carbonara though, so I'm not going to complain there.\n\nOverall, Mangia Tutti was pretty par for the course. It seems like it can accommodate large groups well. I'd consider this place for a quick and easy lunch if I were in the area in the future, but I would probably check out other nearby Italian places first.", "author": "Catherine H."}

If you have any belief that you as the customer are entitled to dignity and decency from the businesses you patronize, don't even consider coming here.\n\nI ordered a pasta dish on my company card over the phone so I could continue working at my desk. I came down to pick it up and noticed that the bill said $21.75--AFTER I had handed over my card and before I saw any itemized bill. I thought that odd because I had just seen the dish listed for $18 online.\n\nSo I asked about that. The person serving me--I believe the owner--told me that the price had changed. I said that's fine, but I just saw the menu online, and that means the new menu didn't reflect the price at which I had agreed to make the purchase. He said that the menu online had been updated. I told him I was sure I remembered correctly. He said that was impossible. So I pulled out my phone and showed him the menu, listing the price at $18.\n\nHe said it was out of date and that I couldn't have just downloaded it. Apparently he thinks I would lie to the point of inventing a restaurant menu PDF to save $2? And then he said it's only $2, so what did I want to do. I told him that wasn't the point--I just wanted him to acknowledge that I had seen the other price, and agree to update the website. I don't even really know what I wanted, other than recognition that they should post accurate prices. He again refused to acknowledge the error and said the right menu was online, and swore at me.\n\nAt that point I was sick of being abused and called a liar so I told him to void the sale, and I walked out hungry. I'm still hungry, but I care more about my dignity and about not empowering bullies than I do about eating some pasta. As I walked out, he yelled at me in front of all the other customers and told me never to come back. He won't have that problem.\n\nThis individual just alienated someone who would have been a repeat customer because he couldn't summon basic respect to take responsibility for his own establishment's error. There are few ways to fail more absolutely in your charge as a restaurant proprietor. I hope he and his business go bankrupt. We all deserve better than this treatment.", "author": "James D."}

It looked a bit fancy but the prices were reasonable, compared to other places on Kearny. You also don't need to line up to get in, which is awesome since most decent places around here have a line or wait time, especially between 12:15-1:00.\n\nThe bread is served with delicious olive oil and some kind of delicious paste. It was great.\n\nI ordered the simple capellini (Angel hair pasta) with olive oil, fresh basil and tomatoes. Simple yet delicious! My colleague ordered the duck ravioli, which looked delicious as well. The portions are also decently sized. \n\nService was also great. Friendly, quick and responsive, but not overly in your face.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice Italian lunch, I highly recommend this place. Check it out!", "author": "Ena Y."}

We were seated at this table in the far corner at the front of the restaurant which is the furthest distance from the kitchen, where our server was most of the time, likely watching TV because I could hear the TV playing but not able to see it. Our waters were empty half the time and it seemed as he checked on us when it was convenient for him.\n\nTheir house salad was exceptional with the vinegar dressing not too overly strong but just at the right balance. The bread and marinara sauce with traces of olive was good, except for the fact I had to ask the server if we could have bread and he failed to give us more: unacceptable. \nI ordered the RAVIOLI DI ANATRA: for those who don't know Italian (myself included) it's ravioli with roasted duck on the inside. As a food critic, I felt that proper measures weren't taken to elevate the dish to the next level. It didn't taste like duck which makes me wonder if it was some faux duck. The sauce wasn't as good as the dipping sauce that came with the bread and to top it off, there were only like 8 raviolis. Guess I should have known that when looking at the type of restaurant we were going to. \n\nSubpar service and a meal where the two best items I had were not even the main course=\n\"no return trip for you\"", "author": "Kyle Y."}

We were only one of two tables being served and our waitress mixed up our order and gave me the wrong beer. As she sat in the back the rest of the night on her phone drinking a glass a wine, the owner was serving the tables. Our biggest problem is that we chose this place for both the yelp reviews and its prices only to find out that they have a different menu for the holidays. Considering the owner said he pays his employees extra for the holidays that's fine and all but change your online menu and don't make up crap to your customers when asked about it.  He seriously said, nobody is bringing capellini or chicken to SF during the holidays.  Take a look at the online menu and our prices in the pics.  I essentially paid $9 to add chicken to a Cesar salad and an additional $5 for capellini which isn't on their \"Holiday Menu\" be they were still able to make it.", "author": "Brian S."}

Let me tell you, after this lunch, everyone on my team congratulated me on my choice of restaurant.\n\nThe service was impeccable. They had the tables set for us before we arrived, so everyone was able to find a seat and get comfortable quickly. They served our drinks immediately and took our meal orders at the first sign that we were ready. Our servers were polite, knowledgable, and attentive. Every glass was refilled before it was empty, and we never ran out of bread or dipping oil before our meals were served. The food came out in a very reasonable amount of time, about 15-20 minutes. Impressive, considering the size of the kitchen, the variety of dishes we ordered, and the number of people being served.\n\nThe quality of the food was fantastic. I enjoyed their saltimbocca even more than what I ate when I visited Rome last year. I used what was left of the bread to mop up every last drop of sauce from my plate. I was saddened when I found out that they were out of cheesecake, but that sadness was soon replaced with chocolate. The Chocolate souffle with molten chocolate sauce, topped with vanilla gelato, was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time, and I eat a lot of desserts!\n\nTo top it all off, the prices were totally reasonable, we had no problem staying within our budget.\n\nEverything about this place was great, I'm looking for excuses to go back.", "author": "Aaron C."}

The prices were very good per entree, and everyone in the restaurant working there was from\nItaly. We also had the dark and white grappa. Turns out the grapes used determine the colour.

Boy was I mistaken here.

Very tasty, salty just enough, and a light tomato based sauce. Yum! I washed the meal down with Barbera by the glass (at $10 I think it was the most expensive by the glass red) and it was good.\n\nService is attentive and friendly, bread is soft and addictive, comes with two dips that are quite good.

We were the first people inside...in fact, by the time we left two and a half hours later, there had only been 2 other tables that had been turned over. I typically never enter an empty restaurant.\n\nUpon seating, sliced baguettes were delivered along 2 dips: tomato/parmesan and olive oil/balsamic. Both dips were equally tasty, however the bread was far from fresh. The crust was hard and it also wasn't warmed...somewhat disappointing to say the least. As for the main course, I opted for the duck ravioli. Again I was  a tad disappointed. Grinding the duck into a fine paste filling was less than optimal. If the menu didn't state duck, I definitely would not have guessed that it was. I would have much preferred shredded duck. On the bright side though, the tomato sauce that accompanied the dish was very flavorful.\n\nThe big kicker of the night was that we were asked to leave for lack of tips which to our defense was definitely a miscalculation. Looking back, I see how a mistake could have been made since we paid with a variety of cards and some cash...but we weren't even given the chance to rectify the situation.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

We had enjoyed appetizers of bruschetta and Caesar salad. When our entr\u00e9es arrived we were all eating when the server came up and asked how things were. Three of us said everything was great but one friend asked to have her chicken replaced with a meatball because the chicken was rubbery. The server was pleasant and agreed to make the switch. Then a man came back out to the table with the chicken entr\u00e9e and proceeded to slice it up into several pieces, at least a dozen, and saying with attitude, \" don't tell me this is tough.\"\nWe were all flabbergasted that he would bring the dish back to our table and put on a rude performance like this. My friend remained calm and tried to explain to him that the chicken was unacceptable. We asked to speak with the manager and he said there would not be a manager in until Monday. He continued to rant and we decided to leave. When I asked the server the phone number for the manager she said there was no manager. Then the ranting man returned and said that he was the owner. God only knows if he was the manager, the owner, the chef or what. \nI slipped the server a 20 because she had given good service. We left without paying the bill.

However some of the issues would impact either table, small or large.\n\nThe first of these is that they were out of three entrees out of a total of about ten, including meatballs which, for an Italian place, should really be a sin.  The bigger sin is that they ran out before 7:00 PM which is when we began ordering.  Not a good start.  The second issue was just how long it took every course to come out and how sporadically they came out.  Half would come out, then 5-10 minutes then a few more, then 5-10 minutes, a few more.  You get the picture.  Five of us waited on entree's for almost 20 minutes after the first ones hit the table.\n\nThe food itself was probably worth three stars once it arrived but three stars in San Francisco is like one - two in a normal restaurant city.  \"Meh.

But,  when we walked in the staff was so nice and welcoming so we went in and sat down.  We opened the menu to find no pizza on the menu,  my boyfriend wanted pizza for dinner.  But,  what we found was authentic Italian dishes.  This was to good to be true given that there was no one in the place.  We ordered caprese salad and bruschetta as appetizers. Wow, amazing!\n\nI wanted wine and asked to taste the Cab that was sold by the glass, our waiter suggested the Cab from Passo Robles instead and he was right,  this was so much better.  \n\nWe had the spaghetti carbonara for our first course and it was absolutely amazing.  Not heavy like the carbonara that you get normally.  It was so flavorful and light and delicious.  The second course that we ordered was the meatballs for my boyfriend and I ordered the Saltimboca. Both were prefect.  My Saltimboca was in a light lemon wine sauce w veggies. It was so delicious.  The chicken was cooked prefect. The meatballs were delicious as well.  \n\nThis is definitely a hidden gem.  The service was prefect and the food was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  You won't regret it!", "author": "Stephanie B."}

Despite some of the mixed reviews, we took a chance and walked to Mangia Tutti. I am glad we did because it was an amazing meal and our service was excellent (it was a Wednesday or Thursday and the restaurant was not that busy). I had the bruschetta, the pappardelle bolognese and the profiteroles. My husband had the antipasto misto, duck ravioli and the tiramisu. My kids had pasta in the most delicious red sauce and meatballs with the chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert. All of us loved our meals. The pastas were fresh and homemade - I can tell the difference. \n\nMaybe New Years and Xmas are not the best days to go, but you would be missing out if you based a visit off of those reviews.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-17", "description": "Three years ago, the boy&I went to a restaurant before senior ball. We weren't really foodies at the time, but we were super impressed by the restaurant we ate at. We didn't really think about it again until a few months later, but the boy, who had made all of the reservations&stuff, had changed phones and therefore, all of his contacts.\n\nDespair. And so began the three-year-hunt for the restaurant we ate at early on in our relationship. Fastforward to July 16th, 2012.\n\nAfter much hunting around, we thought we finally found it. When we arrived, we were delighted to find that it was indeed the same restaurant! Success! The boy was worried that he'd overhyped it in his mind, but we were not disappointed at all.\n\nWe were seated very quickly [I mean, it was a Monday night so it wasn't very busy] and we were brought out bread/olive oil. I love love love bread. The bread was so perfect and the olive oil/roasted garlic was so flavorful, I had to stop myself from eating [to save room for the main courses of course].\n\nOne of the things that stood out to us 3 years ago was the caprese salad, so we made sure to order that. They plate it so simply, yet beautifully, and trust me - the taste definitely matched the presentation. It was so delicious; the mozzarella and tomatoes were super fresh, and you can add your own basalmic vinegar [which is a definite plus for me because I'm not a huuge fan of vinegar, and some places drench their caprese salads in it!].\n\nWe also ordered the Gnocchi Al Gorgonzola and Guazzetto. The boy wanted some wine, so our server brought out his reccomendation, based on the food we'd ordered. The California Chardonay was REALLY good! It went super well with all of our food. The food came out very quickly and ahhhhhh it was even better than we remembered it. The truffle-cream sauce for the gnocchi was perfect! The flavors balanced out so well. The sauce for the Guazzetto [prawn/mushroom pasta] was nice and light, and the noodles were cooked al dente. We had enough leftovers for another meal, but it's okay!\n\nWe then ordered the tiramisu [another standout from 3 years ago]. The slice was just the perfect size for sharing. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but it was literally the most delicious tiramisu I've ever had [well outside of Italy, I guess, but I'd say it's comparable]. We ended the meal feeling suuuper satisfied!\n\nAlthough the meal itself was delicious, what really makes Mangia Tutti stand out is the service. 3 years ago, they served all 18 of us [I believe there were 18 anyway... we took up a whole room!] quickly&efficiently, and I'm glad that that hasn't changed. The server who served the boy&I 3 years ago remembered us! The fact that he's still here after 3 years definitely says a lot about how well the employees are treated as well. My water glass was never less than 1/2 full, and any time we looked like we were done with a dish, someone would come take away our empty dishes and bring out our next course. Everybody is just so friendly&helpful here!\n\nI can't wait to return, and I'm so glad that we rediscovered Mangia Tutti!", "author": "Amy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "The main reason this is a 2-star review (and not 1) is because I've been to this restaurant for lunch a couple times and it has been better. However, my most recent lunch experience was so off-putting that I'm compelled to share...\n\nCaprese salad - Standard. Three slices of mozzarella on three slices of red tomato with chopped basil and olive oil. Nothing special, but a small portion for $8. \n\nBruschetta - Standard. Chopped tomatoes with herbs on three toasted pieces of bread. Mine had a good crunch but my friend said her piece of toast was rock hard, as if it was unfresh and had been out for retoasted.\n\nRavioli Di Anatra - This was their roasted duck ravioli, one of the more unique items on their pasta menu. Order comes with five 3x3in ravioli. Sadly, meat was quite flavorless and unexciting. It sounded like it had so much potential!\n\nGnocchi Al Gorgonzola - Their gnocchi was hands down their best dish. Dumplings were a good texture and the cheese sauce was rich and tasty.\n\nSide of roasted veggies - Exactly what it sounds like. \n\nDessert is where things went from okay to bad \nWe ordered a 1) Tiramisu and 2) Souffl\u00e9 al Cioccolato. \n\nThe tiramisu came and already looked unappetizing visually. The cocoa powder on top was a lighter brown than the normal dark chocolatey color and looked as if it had began to set and mix in with the first layer of cream. Taking the first bite confirmed what I presumed from the first look: this cake was old. The cake itself was sopping wet (not the good way with rum and flavor) so much so that it would break down instantly from scooping it up. It had a funky flavor--nothing clearly rum or mascarpone or coffee. \n\nWe ordered the souffl\u00e9 al cioccolato with the expectation that it would be, well, a souffl\u00e9. As in a light, fluffy, risen dessert made of whipped egg whites. The description on the menu even confirmed \"Homemade chocolate souffl\u00e9 with molten dark chocolate sauce\". Yum! When we got it, we were a bit confused because it came out of the ramekin and it had a scoop of ice cream on top of it. We looked at the menu again to see if they had accidentally given us a chocolate cake instead of the souffl\u00e9 but nothing else matched up. We broke it open to find it was the consistency of a dense lava cake-- definitely not a souffl\u00e9. We gave it a try anyway. Really, really underwhelmed... It tasted like a cake that had been frozen and reheated. The ice cream helped. But overall, a mediocre dessert at best (even if a lava cake is what you wanted, which we didn't.) \n\nWe finally asked our waiter if this was indeed the souffl\u00e9 because it didn't look or taste like a souffl\u00e9. He assured us that a cioccolato was an Italian-style souffl\u00e9, and that it's different from the French. Okay, thats fine. We suggested that he should change the menu description to explain that it's more a lava cake than a souffl\u00e9 because describing your souffl\u00e9 as a souffl\u00e9 might mislead people who have prior expectations of what a souffl\u00e9 is. He replied \"we put souffl\u00e9 in the description because it IS A SOUFFL\u00c9. People don't know what a cioccolato is so we put souffl\u00e9.\" (???) We again told him we understand if it's an Italian souffl\u00e9, but it helps to clarify for the customer exactly what they're getting to avoid situations exactly like the one unfolding. He got more defensive saying souffl\u00e9s are different in different places and that he's been making it like this for 20 years and that it's probably our first time eating here and that's why we don't know etc. Ahhhhh what! Instead of arguing back and trying to educate us on souffl\u00e9s when we're just trying to provide you sincere customer feedback, a simple \"I'm sorry you didn't like our version of Italian souffl\u00e9\" would have sufficed and ameliorated the situation. \n\nHe walked away with a huff and silently dropped off our check, which had the desserts omitted. The point wasn't to get a freebie--it was to give an honest opinion. We tipped him the amount of the desserts and will not be going back.", "author": "Erin N."}

If you want to impress based on location and vibe, this may not be your place.", "author": "Kyle C."}

Short walk from our hotel (Le Meridien).  Excellent quality, good portions and authenticity was great. Service was quick and waiter was pure Italian - bellisimo!\n\nTwo minor drawbacks. 1) because there was no kids menu i asked for kids portions for my kids. They accomodated but only took $2 off the price of the full portion price. I expected a bit more ofna reduction - oh well. 2) Yelp menu online and the menu on site were off by $5-$6 on any of the entrees. Not sure who's to blame but nonetheless misleading. \n\nBy the way, one reviewer mentioned it was a quiet place....not when we went.  My kids are pre teens and are orderly when dining however, a party of 3 families were there and chose not to remind their kids they weren't in a play ground. Not the restaurants fault of course.", "author": "Jim V."}

What a fabulous decision! \n\nThe waiter, very Italian, was so friendly and helpful and was such a pleasure to interact with. We had some wine, which was tasty and reasonably priced as well as the bruschetta as an appetizer. It was very very good bruschetta! \n\nThey had a special of butternut squash ravioli which I ordered and really enjoyed! Our table also ordered the gnocchi, arrabiatta and other dishes. It was all delicious and everyone took home their leftovers or practically licked their plate clean. \n\nThey did also offer dessert - the tiramisu was delicious!

My date ordered the spinach ravioli and I ordered the New York steak, the waiter never asked me how I wanted my steak which I did not realize until the steak was in front of me. Luckily I enjoy steak at almost any temperature however the meat was lacking in quality, it was very fatty and had plenty of cartilage in it. The mushroom sauce on the steak was bland and tasted as if they put mushrooms in brown gravy and passed it off as a mushroom sauce, the mashed potatoes were not made from scratch I could tell because I've worked in the restaurant industry from outback to Ruth's Chris steakhouse, i can tell when a restaurant is trying to save some money. Overall the dining experience wasn't that great, the setting was not romantic and it was definitely not worth the money I paid, you would be better off going to Olive Garden and that's saying something.

Naturally, he is very picky about his Italian cuisine particularly his mother was Sicilian, which many would argue that the Sicilians are not Italians, but that's not in this review. My point is this fella knows good Italian food and if he loves Mangia Tutti, who am I to disagree? \n\nMangia Tutti has been our staple Italian restaurant in the city.  The restaurant owner and executive chef is an El Salvadorian who lived in Italy for years and traveled around the country. He speaks Italian fluently and honed his Italian culinary skills in Italy. So the food you get here is as close to the real thing as you can get in Italy without the air traveling. \n\nThe restaurant is a trattoria style establishment with a casual dining atmosphere resembling of someone's dining room at home. It is not to be mistaken for a high-end Italian restaurant. You go to Mangia Tutti for delicious, authentic Italian food and to socialize with your friends and sometimes with the friendly staff at the restaurant. Here are a few dishes we love that the restaurant does very well:\n\n1. Pasta with Bologna sauce - I know you may think that this is a simple dish that all of us at home had cracked open a jar of pasta sauce and made it for dinner, but Mangia Tutti's bologna sauce is made from scratch and the pot of sauce that are simmered for hours to allow for all the flavors from the ingredients to commingle and what you get is creamy, rich and hearty sauce just like an Italian ma-ma would make. \n\n2. Gnocchi - Homemade right there at the restaurant that I had an opportunity to watch the owner made it by hand. The gnocchis are light, fluffy and you can taste the flavor of the potatoes which is the main ingredient. \n\n3. Veal Milanese - Slices of veal pounded thinly, breaded and fried to golden brown served with the most flavorful reduction sauce and a side of saut\u00e9ed mixed seasonal vegetables. Trust me when I say this, one order is not enough to share. (see picture)\n\n4. Chicken Saltimbocca - chicken pieces that are wrapped with prosciutto (Italian cured ham) and grilled to crispy on the outside and the chicken is still moist and tender on the inside. Top with a slice of melted mozzarella cheese and oven baked potatoes and a ladle of sauce, it is both hearty, flavorful and lick the plate delicious. \n\nIf you find yourself salivating at the dishes described above and considering going to Mangia Tutti for dinner tonight, you already have something in mind to try. There are so many dishes that I have yet to review, but I will share them with you in the near future. Such a great restaurant in the Financial District, a real gem in the city, one review simply can't do it justice. Bon Appetito!", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

Recommended by a friend, I was willing to keep an open mind, given the fact that i am generally underwhelmed by italian places. I was not disappointed. At how underwhelming this place was, that is. \n\nFirst off, i don't like eating at italian restaurants. I can easily make the same dishes at home for a small fraction of the price, and i do mean small. This place was typical in the overpricing of every dish, coupled with the pitiful portion sizes. I guess one thing they have working for them is the low calorie counts, because the ravioli i ordered couldn't feed a four-year-old. As for the taste, way too much oil used, and i would have personally preferred my own cooking.\n\nSecond, the service was pretty bad. Granted, we had a large party, but the restaurant was basically us and 2 other tables of 2. Why did we need to wait 30min to take our order? They also forgot to bring my friend a drink he had ordered and asked about twice. I can understand a relaxed setting, but the service was still way too slow.\n\nI will say that we did receive complimentary tiramisu, which was very good.

It was one of the very few places open on Labor Day so i decided we should give it a try for a lack of more options... boy am  I glad I ended up there. \n\nYes, like other raters, my expectations were low -for reasons already mentioned- but ahh... what a delightful surprise.  The food is great!!  I have been searching with good pappardelle and here i found it!  I am coming from falling in love with pappardelle in Italy, so my expectations are quite high.  And the orecchiette? Delish! \n\nWe walked in -the place was pretty slow- and ordered to go.  The service was fast and they were very nice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-24", "description": "Solid Italian food with a homey, trattoria feel. The appetizers we ordered were carpaccio and caprese salad. The caprese was good but not exceptional. The tomatoes were Roma, and since we're in the waning days of summer, they were still red and juicy. There are three stacks of tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil chiffonade on the plate, and it splits perfectly for three people sharing. The carpaccio reminded me of the dish I had while I was in Florence. The meat was thinly sliced and fresh (hours later and no stomach ache; always an important consideration!), topped with capers and generous shards of parmigiano. In the center, was a peppery bed of arugula which complemented the beef perfectly.\n\nThe house wines were good and reasonably priced. Don't you hate when you order a glass of wine and it turns out to be more expensive than your entree? It's a pet peeve of mine. Servers should tell you if they recommend something that's far pricier than other menu items. There was no problem with this at Mangia Tutti.\n\nThe best dish by far was the Fettuccine agli Scampi: ribbons of handmade pasta coated in a silky white wine sauce flecked with welcome bits of arugula and crowned with four meaty butterflied shrimp. My companions ordered other dishes and looked upon mine with envy. Their pasta dishes (bolognese and arrabiata) were good too, but the scampi was the best.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable for the area. Mangia Tutti is better than a lot of the overpriced North Beach Italian restaurants, and you can pop in for lunch if you work in the Financial District.", "author": "Busy B."}

Doing a quick yelp search for the 2-block proximity of the Hilton, we saw Mangia Tutti. Made reservations for 8pm and we're all set.\n\nArrived about 7:30pm as we got quicker than we planned. The place was surprisingly quiet for a Saturday evening. I guess I can kind of understand this as the Financial District isn't too full of evening walkers/shoppers as in other adjacent areas.\n\nGot seated and it started to fill up a little over the course of our meal. We started with bruschetta and a small salad. Both came out very quickly and it seemed that the bruschetta had been kicking it in the fridge until we ordered... tomatoes and parmesan were a bit colder than we preferred.\n\nOn to the main course... duck ravioli for me and gnocchi for the lady. Both were very outstanding! I'm not a connoisseur of Italian food, but both were perfect.  We shared a chocolate souffle for dessert... one side of it was perfectly cooked and the other seemed like it was still a bit cold. \n\nOverall, it was worth the short walk from the hotel, and the price paid. Having the restaurant not be at capacity was nice for us too... as we were able to have a conversation and not feel rushed out the door.", "author": "steve a."}

Based on Yelpers' reviews I thought the family would enjoy it here.\n\nI made a reservation through open table and put in the comments that we were celebrating a 16-yr old birthday.  We arrived at 6:30, 30 minutes early but no worries the place was largely empty.  Sometimes I worry that there's something I don't know if it's empty but I attributed it to the early hour (and I was right).\n\nThe friendly staff (and owner too I believe) greeted us upon arrival and also knew we were celebrating a brithday (good sign... they read the comments in the reservation).  We had a nice table by the window and had water, bread and oil as soon as we sat down.\n\nWe had a charming young lady serving us, here from Russia for just a year or so.  She was really sweet and made sure everything was ok with the food, drink, etc...  \n\nWe had a few drinks and asarted with the antipasti plate of assorted munchies and then ordered dinner. The roundup was: ribeye steak, fettucinne and tiger prawns, homemade lasanga (special), spaghetti and butter (for the youngest) and me (ravioli stuffed with duck breast etc...).  \n\nFood was great!  Served hot and timely.  Everything was very tasty, not overloaded with salt, etc.... The only down side, albeit very small, was that my wife's ice tea wasn't very good. She's a bit of a connoiseur when it comes to ice tea so the tea has to be pretty darn good.  Anyway it's a minor blemish on a very nice meal.\n\nThe style is very \"European\" to me.  By that I mean we were never rushed... the portions weren't overwhelming... service was attentive but never pushy...  We could have just sat there all night and they would have never brought the check until i said we were ready.  That style of service is so rare to find in the USA. \n\nOverall we had a very nice time.  They even surprised our daughter with a complementary slice of tiramisu (very good by the way) and sang happy birthday in Italian.  \n\nWe enjoyed our time here very much and you will to if you are looking for a casual easy-going establishment.", "author": "steve b."}

Even though the service is friendly and they're even open for dinner, Mangia Tutti is the type of place that's like how Kirsten Dunst described herself in \"Elizabethtown...\"I'm impossible to forget, but I'm hard to remember.\"\n\nPart of the reason I can't seem to get traction on a memory of this place is that I always seem to be in the company of co-workers, and I am a dreadful small-talker. As I attempt with little success to think of the politically correct thing to say, I'll notice I've eaten my lunch in three bites. That's what happened today when I ordered the $12.95 Ravioli di Anatra, big raviolis with duck inside and covered in a tomato sauce. It was pretty good from what I recall, but honestly, it's left my short-term memory already.\n\nMaybe I should try this place after work with friends and see if my experience changes much.

My first visit being a party, so we mostly dined on antipasti (bruschetta, caprese, etc.)  I do recall the appetizers being fabulous as I chowed endlessly on them.  \n\nArriving at noon today, the place was bustling.  We were seated pretty immediately with our party of 8, no reservations.  I came with a bunch of regulars, so the waitstaff was super excited to see us.  \n\nBeverage orders were taken and bread with an olive oil mix was placed at our table.  The olive oil mix was a bit different from what you get from other restaurants, so that's a nice touch.  We waited quite awhile to get our order in though.  It was busy, and maybe they were understaffed?\n\nI chose the Ravioli De Anatra (homemade ravioli filled with roasted duck in a sun-dried tomato, pine nuts, and basil sauce), $10.95 based on Conny W. recommendation of their homemade ravioli.  It came with about 6-8 rectangular raviolis in a light sauce.  It was tasty.  Not fantastic per se, but good though.  My colleagues ordered the Pollo Al Funghi (roasted half chicken with a procini mushroom sauce) $12.95; salmon from their daily special menu; risotto from their daily special menu; and a few other dishes.  From what I could make out, everyone ate everything off their plate, or took home the rest.  That's usually a good sign in my opinion.\n\nThey closed out our meal with complimentary Homemade Tiramisu ($4.50), which was pretty yummy.  (And I don't particularly care for Tiramisu either.)  Overall, it was a decent lunch, but just took too long. \n\nYes, the staff is super nice and you end up giving kisses to the waiter when you leave!

A friend and I were in town for the SF Marathon and did not plan ahead for our carboloading dinner. Mangia Tutti was the closest Italian restaurant to our hotel and was able to squeeze us in for dinner.\n\nThe restaurant is small and pretty casual and seems to be family-operated. The service we received was very personal. I was impressed to find out that our main server is not one of the employees - she's a regular customer who pitched in for this busy pre-marathon evening. \n\nFor the marathon, they had a prix fixe dinner menu for $22.50 which included Insalata Della Casa, Polenta Gratinata, and a pasta dish. They accomodated my vegetarian friend's request to switch to the Raviolo di Spinaci (ravioli w/ spinach). I ordered the Gnocchi ala carte ($14) at the hostess' recommendation.\n\nThe bread was served with dipping oil which was a mixture of roasted garlic, balsamic vinegar, and chopped basil was sooo good! We finished the whole thing and would have asked for more had the salad and polenta not arrived.\n\nThe salad was good - the greens they used was a combination of a spring mix and some herbs.\n\nThe polenta was one of my favorite things from that evening. It was smooth and creamy topped with a crumbled mixture of cheeses. Perfect comfort food. (Note: I am salivating as I write this.) \n\nMy other favorite was the melt-in-your-mouth Gnocchi in the black truffle and creamy gorgonzola sauce. The truffle flavor infused the dish and I was impressed that the gorgonzola did not overwhlem it.\n\nMy friend raved about the Raviolo di Spinaci in tomato sauce. She was pleasantly surprised with the serving size - there were 4 raviolis, each measuring about 4 square inches and generously filled with a mixture that was mostly spinach (instead of mostly ricotta).  \n\nEven with repeated prompting from the mature gentleman (who I took to be the owner of the place) to finish our food, the generous portions had us putting our forks down with a quarter of the pastas still untouched.", "author": "Dexie L."}

So Good.  \n\nI was a little hesitant to go in only because this restaurant is not in North Beach where all of the other Italian restaurants in SF are and because its on the edge of Chinatown...i thought how good can this place be?  VERY GOOD.\n\nMy co-worker and I were very warmly greeted and we could tell that the restaurant was family run.  The specials were deliciously described and we wanted to eat it ALL.  \n\nWe ended up ordering 3 appetizers and split a pasta entree. With 2 Diet Cokes, the total before tip was $44. Not bad.  \n\nThe bread with garlic, oil, herb dipping sauce was AMAZING. so we knew we were in for a treat!  \n\nWe split the bruchetta which was perfectly toasted and \"garlicked\" pieces of bread topped with nicely salty, herby, roasted tomatoes.  YUM.\n\nI had the carpaccio which was beautifully arranged in a flower shape with a nice pile of argula and thinly sliced parmagian cheese on the middle. IT also had capers and a nice drizzling of olive oil. Delicious! The capers added a nice acid. The cheese and arugula gave the bite a nice bitter bite. \n\nMy co-worker had the Mangia Tutti salad. I forgot to ask how it was.\n\nWe split the sphagetti alla carbonara. It was my first experience with this dish and SO delicious!! I've been missing out all these years! The pasta was perfectly al dente and tasted fresh and homemade. The sauce was creamy and nicely cheesey/eggy.  SO delicious!\n\nWe are going back on Tuesday (today if Friday) when we are back in the area. We plan on trying the minestrone and the papardelle with meat sauce.\n\nI cant wait to go back.. in fact, i'd take my Italian brother in law here!  affordable, authentic.

Yes, I've gotten stomach poisoning in the past or have received undercooked food, but nothing and I say nothing tops being treated with rudeness and disdain by the owner.\n\nI've been here in the past and have found that the restaurant offers decent family style meals at affordable prices and recommended that we come here for a slight change to the typical Chinese and Thai food that is in the neighborhood.\n\nFirst off the food during a typical lunch hour took extraordinarily long to come out.  Ok, not a big deal but when I signaled to the owner who was also serving as a waiter to see if he can check on the meal, he gave me a stern look and said \"IT'S COMING\".....WTF?!  It's like I don't have the right to ask to check why the meal hasn't come out after 20 minutes.  The proper answer is I'm sorry the kitchen is backed up today or let me take a look for you.\n\nThe thing that really ticked me off is when paying for the bill we put down $40 cash and $16 on a card....so total of $56 for a $48 bill.  Paying 15% tip is already generous after the rude response from the owner/waiter.  No change comes out and we then ask for the change.  The owner acts like what?  I thought the rest is tip...and now we are all very much pissed off.  Luckily, the younger son/nephew (don't really know) comes over and tries to alleviate things and brings us the entire change.  We leave a standard 15% tip when even I was seriously considering zero.  Walking out he gives me the evil eye and says nothing.  My friend walks out and he yells out \"unbelievable.\"\n\nSo in a nutshell, wait for food, get yelled at for asking for food, tries to take our entire cash, we still leave 15% tip and then calls us unbelievable as we walk out the door.\n\nI truly recommend that no one dines here.  The food is really nothing special and it's clear that the owner has no concern about his customers", "author": "Laurence H."}

We came on a Monday night, so it was pretty empty and our party of 12 had a good portion of the restaurant to ourselves. The service was good - attentive and available when needed. The food was good - I would say that the pasta was above average. I had the duck ravioli which was suprisingly light and not too filling like a lot of pasta dishes. It could have used a bit more flavor but overall was very enjoyable. My husband had the tube pasta with sausage - this was a good dish but really nothing out of the ordinary. A few others got the gnocchi, which actually looked amazing. I think we'll be back sometime - and I'll try the gnocchi. For dessert, they gave us a tiramisu with a candle - and the tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had.", "author": "Christy M."}

We tried several and not one was disappointing. I am one of these can-you-substitute-this-and-that guests. The waiter listened well, and with no problem did he create a wonderful salad for me. They love pleasing you and will cook for you whatever makes you happy. They can handle requests by people who have special needs when it comes to food, with no problem. I was impressed how they did not mind and offered to cook whatever is best for me. \nThat was a treat. \nAlso their vine suggestions seem really good. I don't drink but our friends were pleased with what the waiter picked. \nWe had no time for the desert unfortunately - but will go back to try more, including the desert items. \nThe restaurant is simple, easy to get around in, service is warm and caring, the bathroom is clean and wheelchair accessible, you can look into the kitchen if you want and they play music on request even.

There's only one server (I think he's also the owner) but because there are so few patrons, it all works out.\n\nThe food is really delicious - I've enjoyed the homemade ravioli and the spaghetti carbonara.  The spaghetti was incredible!  All yummy with bits of egg and a rich sauce.

And I didn't feel like getting chinese food. I was hungry. I needed parking validation. \r\n\r\nIt went like this: I walk in to the counter and I'm greeted by an older italian man (I assume he was the owner) who took my hand in his and began saying the most flattering things to me in Italian. I'm already won over. I order the grilled salmon to go.  \r\n\r\nThe staff is very down to earth & friendly, but not overly so. As I was standing there at 11:45, I noticed that nearly everyone working there wasn't only doing *their* job, but doing whatever they could to keep things flowing. What teamwork! A definite reflection of the management/ownership, I believe.  I noticed the place filling up with financial district workers, business types, and obvious regulars that knew the staff by name. \r\n\r\nMy salmon was good, but not the best I've had. It was almost like it wasn't cooking fast enough for them, so they popped it into a frying pan. Sort of half grilled, half fried. But not over cooked, for sure. The veggies were cooked just right. Satisfying to say the least. \r\n\r\nNote to self: I must go back again for a sit down lunch. Be warned that this is not a fancy schmancy polished gourmet restaurant, but more of a homey, little mom & pop place where they remember you.

I don't know if it has to do with the decor or just the sheer lack of customers.  We went on a Saturday evening when all the North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf restaurants were 1+ hour waits.  This place was bone dry.  On one hand, I liked the attentive staff (as if they had a choice), but it was wierd to be the only people in the place.\n\nNow that out of the way...\n\nFood - the menu said the pasta was \"homemade\".  I have to say, the pasta was really good...really good.  My wife had the duck stuffed ravioli, kids had the mac and cheese, in-laws had salmon and linguine w/ clams.  I tried it all, and was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the pasta, flavors of  the dishes (even teh mac and cheese) and the freshness of the seafood.  I had the gnocci in a black truffle cream sauce.  Truffle flavor was excellent.  I\"m not a gnocci fan, but this dish really hit the mark.\n\nService - It was sort of neat that the waiter (I think the owner) took time to remember my kids names.  It really felt like you're eating at a friend's house who's mom can cook really well.  The were attentive and prompt, yet stayed out of our way.

We both ordered specials that the waiter described lovingly and very appetizingly, and I opted for a dish (ah, the name escapes me) with capers and assorted seafood including scallops. I believe my dining companion got chicken parmigiana.\n\nSalads for both of us. They were kind of anemic and the greens sliding towards being flabby, but the surreality started when the waiter asked us if we wanted fresh ground black pepper on them. He grinds the mill with great gusto, but it makes little noise and only a miniscule smattering of pepper dust comes out. It was rather \"Emperor's New Clothes\"-esque.\n\nTime passes... more time passes... entirely too much time passes. (Is there anyone in the kitchen? Oh, somebody just showed up back there. Was he taking a nap?) Finally signs of food preparation are seen and heard.\n\nWe eventually get the food, and it looks okay, tho' we were both a bit underwhelmed by the size of the portions, but the whole thing just got absurd when we started eating and, after a few bites of our respective dishes, looked at each other and asked, almost in unison, \"Does yours have any flavor?\"\n\nThe answer from both sides was an unequivocal \"no\". We tried the salt shaker on the table. Except nothing much seemed to come out of that, either. And I had a few more bites of mine and noticed that there wasn't a single caper nor scallop in it. I was too tired from an especially trying day at work to make a fuss about it, and we just finished off our dishes, but afterwards we remarked about how surreal it was that the food had this total void of flavor, and all the various associated weirdness that accompanied the experience.\n\nCan't recommend it on the food, but the waiter was endearing.

I tried the orrechiete with sausage & asparagus. It was pretty good. The tomato salad (the name escapes me at the moment) was decent. The antipasto for two is good if you're with a group. We did not try dessert.\n\nNow why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4: the place was a little to brightly lit but when they did dim the lights, it seemed much nicer. The bathroom had a condom wrapper in the toilet (yuck!) but it wasn't dirty.\n\nThe service was friendly though. \n\nIt's a good value but a little out of the way for me but I would go there if I could not get a reservation for a big group at an italian place in SF.", "author": "Glenn G."}

And it ruined our Christmas Eve :( Although we made reservations we had to wait in a crowded cold hallway with our two year old. Once we were seated we had to wait a really long time to get the menus and water. Then we had to \"catch\" a waiter to make an order. Needless to say we had to wait an hour to get our food, which was very simple - ravioli and pasta with some mushrooms! It was cold too. Unacceptable! Throughout our whole dining not even once a waiter came to our table, we had to haul whatever waiter we could see. We weren't the only ones \"deserted\" either, there were a few other couples that were waiting for hours to order and get food. Strange enough the bigger parties were served immediately. People that came after us were served first :( No words can describe our disappointment. we were treated disrespectfully and didn't hear a one \"sorry\" from anyone. The reason of such terrible experience was obviously poor managing skills, not enough stuff and just complete rudeness of people that work there. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!", "author": "Joanna V."}

I selected it because of its good yelp reviews and reasonably priced menu.  I would say it was fairly run of the mill.  The bread and olive oil in the beginning was good, but the orechiette pasta I got was just okay.  It actually seemed fairly bland to me.

First time I came and ordered a panini sandwich at like 2pm - almost no people there. It took at least 20 minutes for my sandwich to come out, maybe more.\n\nSecond time I came with my wife around 12:30 noon.  We immediately ordered, but received our food at 1:20pm - 50 minutes later!  And after waiting for so long, no food will taste great.\n\nFinally, I remember dropping my business card into the bowl for a \"free lunch\" raffle.  Weeks later I got a call from a financial services advisor, who is telling me I won a free lunch for 10 of my friends (!!), but the only catch is that we have to come at a given time, on a given date, and have to listen to her 5-10 minute self-promotion to the whole group.  This is not a FREE LUNCH, this is a totally LAME way to get people brainwashed for your services.  Of course the cost of a free lunch ($10?) is worth a good lead in a financial district, this totally makes sense.  NO THANKS.\n\nI gave this restaurant 2 stars because it's not a complete disaster. You can probably eat your food, and even learn financial advice. But the price is high, so I just don't think it's worth it.", "author": "Konstantin G."}

We were a large party with quite a few kids, so we made an early reservation to hopefully get in and out quickly with little interruption to other diners. No such luck...it took over 15 minutes for them to bring us water, at which point we were very ready to order and hoping our food would come quick. We asked for bread and for an appetizer, which took about 20 minutes to get there. One of the adults in our party asked for a glass of wine (the rest of weren't drinking for a variety of reasons), and that took another 10 minutes. It started getting busier, but still we waited. We considered ordering another appetizer, if we thought we'd get it quickly, but our waitress didn't even come by for us to do that. Our dinner came exactly an hour after our reservation time. Well - half our dinner anyway. Our waitress brought out half of the entrees, then went and took another table's order before going to get the other half of our entrees. And at that point, we were still short one entree - it hadn't been ordered from the kitchen or they forgot to make it, don't know, but the waitress said she'd go order it. We cancelled it since we didn't have another hour to wait! On the plus side, I can say that the portions were large enough that we were able to share enough for my friend who didn't get her entree! \n\nWe never saw our waitress again to ask for the check, or another glass of wine or anything else (we did ask for more bread at some point before our entrees came, but never got it), so we finally had to go find our waitress to get it. Naturally, they tried to charge us for the entree that never came, but we got that removed. They did forget the glass of wine (more on that later). All in all, our bill was pretty low, considering we were there for almost 2 hours. When we took the check up to pay the owner, he actually said \"that's it?? This is your bill, that's all you spent?\" My husband told him that we had one glass of wine, but it didn't get charged for it and would cover it in his tip, but the owner was still ranting that his waitress would pay for this out of her pocket. Pay for what? I don't know, but I couldn't believe he was so rude! I'm sure he expected to make more money from a party of 8 that held a table for 2 hours, but if you don't provide basic service, you're not going to get it! We could have been out of there in an hour or less (that's all kids have patience for anyway) and he could have been serving other people, but instead we sat there and waited, and waited....\n\nOne other comment. I mentioned we had kids with us and I know restauranteurs aren't always thrilled to have kids come. I can honestly say our kids were really well behaved considering how long they had to wait. I can admit that at some point, I stopped shushing them and making them stay in their seats - I felt like screaming and running in circles to get my food, I couldn't blame 3 year olds for feeling the same. :-)\n\nHaving lived in SF for years, I know there are much better restaurants. We were limited by location and chose this place because we could walk from where we were staying, but I will not make that mistake again.", "author": "Katie R."}

Because if it actually was in NB, it would have lines out the door. In my humble opinion, they make THE best gnocchi in the city -- and it comes smothered in an amazing gorgonzola sauce that clearly could clog all your arteries if eaten on a daily basis. I only withheld a star because they no longer support the addition of grilled chix to the gnocchi, which made it REALLY fab. Not only a great lunch spot, it is a nice quiet place for a reasonably priced dinner, especially if you want pastas, which are consistently great. The service is excellent...all in all, they make you feel like a guest in their home...it is difficult to remember that at some point, lunch must end and you have to get back to work. Luckily, they serve Italian coffees to help counter the inevitable food coma that will set in...", "author": "Julia C."}

The service was good and the food was great. The cheesecake was mmmmmMMM scrumptious. They were in the middle of serving a large party, but the staff was still able to meet our every need and on time. The servings were pretty big too.", "author": "Sarah P."}

We tried to supplement with bread but they wanted to charge extra for bread.  We left wondering where near by we could get something else to eat.  We agreed It is time to find another Italian restaurant in the area.  It borders North Beach so it should be easy to do better.  We won't be returning.", "author": "Richard H."}
