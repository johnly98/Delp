It's like trying the bread/oil combo at an Italian restaurant to judge how good everything else is or a basic taco at a full service Mexican place.\n\nWell, the duck was some of the best I've ever had in the many major cities I've tried it in.  It still had the star anise hanging onto the crispy skin as I devoured every little piece possible.  The rice plate which costs as much as an extra value meal, comes with a good amount of rice and a small mix of choy and lettuce.  We also had beef chow foon and a side of cooked lettuce.  Neither were as spectacular as that roasted duck, though.  \n\nIn Boston, we are used to cold and quick service.  Not here, they took their time to listen to what we had to say, made sure we understood clearly that it was cash only and the lady taking our order made sure I didn't overpay for a crispy noodle dish.  I'm still a little weirded out by SF culture and those who are nice to you, it's not standard everywhere. \n\nAll of the places we could have eaten in Chinatown and we decided to go back a second night, it was seriously that good.  I loved everything about this place, it was quaint, a little bit on the dirty side and still a big enough hole in the wall where you didn't feel cramped.  As mentioned, the service was stellar and the chefs greeted us both on our way in and way out.  You can't ask for anything better.", "author": "Jeff M."}

There are a lot of tables within the restaurant but all the tables are very close to each other. Be prepared to share some personal space! Kam Po Kitchen offers sit-down meal service or a take-out line for those who wish to bring home roast duck, soy sauce chicken or any meat of the sort. \n\nI have tried a number of the dishes offered here. Roast duck over rice, duck wonton soup and prawn with egg chow fun are all good choices. Everything is also inexpensive. Unlike many of the butcher shops in Chinatown, Kam Po does not skimp out on the meat. I have tried the prawn with egg chow fun dish throughout many Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, and the one here is hands down the best. \n\nMany of the staff members here don't speak English. Two of the female staff speaks English and provides good service though. The only thing that irks me is that the dining tables are always so greasy or oily from a lack of quality deep cleaning. This is a very popular lunch spot for locals in Chinatown. Kam Po is great for your stomach and easy on your wallet and it's definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Chinatown!

Their menu is vast, but for a place like this - stick with the basics: porridge, noodle dishes, or rice plates.\n\nWe began with a medium serving of fish filet porridge, my families baseline for porridge these days. I thought it was delicious - it had the right consistency and was very generous with fish. It was also infused with a good amount of ginger and cilantro which definitely kicked it up a notch!\n\nNext came the beef chow fun and Peking duck and roasted pork over rice. Hands down, the latter won. The roasted pork was awesome! We also chose to order this because we noted the hanging pig was still within the half range point (the best area). It was meaty, not too fat, and well spiced. The pork skin was nice and crisp. The duck was on the fatty side, but like good Peking duck, it dripped all its glorious juices into the rice beneath and that greasy goodness reminded me of days when I used to throw a tantrum as a child and get this or soy sauce rice as my alternative dinner. And yeah, maybe I did this a little more often than I should have....but it's so worth. The beef chow fun was pretty standard but I liked that they didn't use too many fillers (onions and bean sprouts). The noodles were also sauteed correctly and not glued together. Kudos to the chef!\n\nTo get a few veggies in, we also opted for gai lan sauteed with beef tendons. The veggies were crisp but came soaking in beef tendon sauce/broth which probably eliminated all its health benefits but sure tasted good anyway. The tendons were also large and not chewy, cooked just right.\n\nAll in all, it's definitely one of Chinatown's best casual places to grab a bite!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

This no frills spot on the edge of Chinatown is known for its BBQ  and roasted Chinese meats. It's totally a quick, cheap eats spot.  \n\nArrived here because I had a real craving for wonton soup.  So much so that I couldn't proceed any further with my day before satiating my craving.  I've been here for take out of their roasted meats, as well as their beef chow fun.  The chow fun here is always nicely wok fried, and the noodles never clump or stick together. \n\nI heard this place served very generous portions, so that piqued my interest.  You know the saying though, \"The proof is in the pudding\".  Well, my response to that has always been, \"Serve up the pudding!\".  Show me!  Prove it to me!  And not with words.  Talk is cheap...Well, they did.\n\nI was served a huge bowl of roasted duck with wontons and rice noodles, for just $8.00 pre-tip.  The massive portion of roasted duck was very meaty and moist.  Most importantly, unlike many noodle joints that literally drown their meats in the broth, Kam Po perfectly \"floated\" their meat atop a massive mound of rice noodles.  This kept the skin of the duck perfectly crispy.  This was worth the entire dish, my friend.  \n\nThe won tons, filled with pork and shrimp were fine. \n\nThe amount of rice noodles were literally ginormous.  In fact, I would've preferred 50% less. Did I just say that?  Yes, simply because rice noodles tend to absorb liquid like a sponge, and by the time I finished only about 20% of the dish, I was left with gloppy rice noodles, and barely any remaining broth.  However, if you like huge portions, this is for you.\n\nAgain, this is a DIVE.  If one desires to dine here, one must remember that a nice ambiance is obsolete.  While I was here, an elderly Chinese gentleman was literally yelling on his phone in Chinese during the entire course of my lunch.  The other elderly Chinese customers also seemed perturbed.

Totally worth the hike because there is just so much delicious meat at such a reasonable price.  A very unpretentious place, where office workers can eat beside construction workers.\n\nRoast Pork: The bubbly crispy exterior is simply amazing!  The meat and fat underneath isn't quite fall part though.  It's firm to the bite, but not too tough.  The whole thing is really good with a little of the chili oil that's on the table.  Only disappointing thing was the inconsistency of the crispy skin; it seemed my table mates got more crispy skin on their plates.\n \nBBQ Pork: The highly marinated end pieces are the best.  The large leaner pieces are good too, with a nice balance of flavoring.  Wasn't a fan of the fattier pieces since they didn't absorb the marinade as well and the fat seemed tougher than the fat in the roast pork.\n\nLo Mein: More exciting the white rice.

This is still a great place to fill your stomach, but this \"restaurant\" is glorified fast food for dirt cheap.  There's the staple selections of Chinese BBQ items hanging in the front as well as cooked items from the back kitchen.  \n\nI ate here with my mom recently, and I can't recommend this place as an adult.  First, Kam Po has anywhere seating with no host/hostess.  Be prepared to elbow/jockey for position against elderly folk who know that the rule is make-your-seating-anywhere-there's-an-opening.  Be prepared to sit with random people, whether you like it or not.  Once you grab a seat, you will have to wait to be served if other customers are more aggressive than you.  There is one waitress for the entire restaurant.  Your table may or may not be bussed when you sit.  Have fun ordering from the impatient waitress.  Good luck with refills of tea or tap water.  Don't be surprised if you see vermin.  Yes, I saw a dead rat on the floor in plain sight.\n\nOn the positive front, food comes out fresh and hot, and it still tastes as good as it did when I was a kid, hence 2 stars.", "author": "Don L."}

I decided to go for some porridge because this place was close by and they serve sampan porridge. I came with a friend and we were seated immediately in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered the sampan porridge, the frog porridge, and the curry beef over rice. \n\nThe sampan porridge was the first dish to come out and it was pretty large. I'd say there was enough porridge for roughly five small bowls in the big bowl that it came with (it seems to be what they classified as a medium, which is very generous, especially for $3.90).  \n\nThe curry beef over rice came out next, and then finally the frog porridge came out. I ordered the frog porridge mostly because I never had frog in porridge. The bowl that the frog porridge came in was of equivalent size to the sampan porridge, which means that we had the equivalent of ten small bowls of porridge to eat, along with the curry beef over rice (the sampan porridge only had one size (medium), while we also got the frog porridge in medium size for $5.10).  \n\nNow, this is probably one instance where I should have checked the pictures of the porridge on Yelp to get a feeling of the sizing because when everything came out, I didn't know if we were going to be able to finish this. I must emphasize again that the portions are very generous here, and in retrospect, I think we should have just ordered one bowl of porridge instead of two. We were hungry, but not ten small bowls of porridge and a rice plate hungry. \n\nAnyways, the Sampan porridge contained assorted seafood, and a generous helping of peanuts to top it off as seen in the picture. I was honestly a little surprised to see little slices of squid in there. The curry beef was delicious as well. I was also pleasantly surprised by the frog porridge and its deliciousness, and the only thing that could have made this dish better was if they stripped away all the bones beforehand cooked with the porridge, but that's probably asking a bit too much. We managed to finish all three dishes in roughly forty minutes, although it was a bit difficult finishing the porridge due to the sheer size of it.\n\nOverall, my assessment of this place is solid four, and I came away from this experience very bloated and satisfied. As I sit here writing this review, I could feel myself feeling a bit better after the large helpings of the porridge. The only thing that could be better about this place is if they took credit cards, but it is what it is. Now if you skipped all the way down here and didn't read any of the literature preceding this sentence, all you need to know is that there are very large helpings of porridge at a very reasonable price; that's my one takeaway from eating here.", "author": "Nelson X."}

One of the waitress spoke extremely fast and gave us double the portion of meat rather than half and half. There was another waitress who was more patient and asked us if we wanted \"lai tong\" which is the free soup that usually comes with BBQ meals.\n\nThe soup came first. It was carrots and leafy greens in a clear pork bone broth. Even though the description isn't that appealing, I'd still encourage you to try it out! It's very light and clear tasting and the carrots add sweetness to it. \n\nI knew our roasted pork would be good the moment I saw it hanging near the butchering station. The pork skin was roasted to perfection and was extra crispy, and the flavor was consistent throughout the pieces of it! The pork belly was fatty enough for it to melt nicely with the rice. \n\nThe roasted duck was not bad, but I had better. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his char siu as much as he thought he would.

Thank goodness Kam Po is still around though.  It's been a while since I've been back, but my first trip here was over 20 years and they're still going strong!\n\nStepping inside, Kam Po likely won't impress, save for the tasty looking rack of roasted pork, ducks, and chickens next to the counter (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kam-po-kitchen-san-francisco?select=GOlu69zPbWbawS0Moe9L2g)  The place is somewhat small, the floors aren't exactly spic-and-span, and the tables have obvious signs of wear and tear.  However, the menu and, more importantly, the food do not disappoint.  The range of offerings may not amaze, but the quality, as well as the cheap prices, definitely stand out!\n\n-- HAINANESE CHICKEN WITH RICE...$5.55\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kam-po-kitchen-san-francisco?select=IMKRS_R8gTerP666h8K6Vg)\nSuch a large portion for such a tiny price!  The chicken was meaty, tender, and moist and they certainly didn't skimp on the garlic sauce (poured on top rather than on a separate dish).  Plus, there was a lot of pickled vegetables too!  As good as everything was though, I wish the rice itself had a stronger taste of chicken and ginger to it.\n\n-- TWO BBQ ITEMS WITH RICE - Roast Duck and Roast Pork...$8.30\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kam-po-kitchen-san-francisco?select=ZZTE_asvtu5sg-Ilq7tgzQ)\nCompared to my go-to for Chinese BBQ (Cheung Hing), Kam Po holds up pretty well!  While some of the skin could have been crispier, the cut of Roast Pork was fairly thick and didn't have a ton of fat on it.  As for the duck, it was just as good as what I had as a kid - very juicy, luscious, and oh so tender.  Plus, the sauce they pour on the meat and rice is so delicious!\n\nAdmittedly, had I been on the fence with how many stars to give, I likely would have been a little more generous simply because of all of the memories I have from coming here as a kid (it's been a family favorite ever since my grandfather had moved to Chinatown).  However, I can honestly say I didn't have to in this case.  Sure, I can see why some might not be as enthused as I am, but we've never had any problems here and the food (and value) more than warrant the four star rating.\n\nThanks, Kam Po, for the delicious comfort food and trip down memory.

It's not that they're rude or anything, but servers will definitely cater to Chinese-speaking customers first and will give them faster service!\n\nYour meal starts with a complementary chicken and vegetable soup. It's very simple, designed to warm your stomach and clean your palate while eating. The menu is a bit overwhelming? There are so many different rice plates, soups, noodles that all I can say is... just pick what your heart desires and you'll probably enjoy it LOL. Prices are very CHEAP.

Go here if you're trying to get the bang for your buck!\n\nTIP: portions are large so order a rice dish if you want to take it to go.

So many soup noodles. \n\nCame here for dinner seeking some roast duck. We left stuffed with duck, noodles, bitter melon, BBQ pork (char siu), wontons... The roast duck over rice is a good deal. Not only does it feel like you're served half a duck, but it's also really tasty! The flavor seemed pretty great and the meat was juicy.  The skin wasn't super crisp and on the fattier side, but I kinda like it that way. You can also get the roast duck in a bowl of won ton noodles - you get a lot of duck and wonton dumplings, but the skin isn't crispy.. the addition of won ton dumplings (they're just ok, a little starchy and dense) isn't worth soggy duck.  \n\nChar siu (BBQ pork) was definitely homemade and not cloyingly sweet - which I really appreciated. It also isn't bright red like you might find at other restaurants. What you end up with is a natural looking savory BBQ pork, with a hint of sweetness. It's also a bit fatty.

It's still a bit oily, so I don't know if you actually feel healthier for eating these vegs.  The bitter melon was pretty good though - if you enjoy bitter melon.

It's a bit off the beaten path, and seemed to house more locals than tourists (aka me). When we entered at 2 for a late lunch, there were no tables available, which made me really excited. Secondly, the staff spoke minimal English, so it seemed more authentic than American. Lastly, like the Chinatown visits of my childhood, roast duck and pork hung in the window and there was a cook with his large cleaver slicing them on his wood stump. All of these things just made me break out into a gigantic grin. \n\nAfter a bit of a wait and some awkward waving/eye contact attempts, we were seated crammed in a small table. I opted for the beef tendon noodle soup, and my friend went with the duck noodle soup. We ordered a side of crispy roast pork, because he had never tried it before and I was curious if it was as good as the one my grandmother used to make or ones I have eaten out at restaurants throughout life. The pork, I was disappointed. I think they served us some that had been previously cut, so the meat was a little dry and it was cold-ish. The skin was oily but not very crispy, lacking the crackle I love so much. Redemption came in the form of noodles, as we both enjoyed the dishes they brought out. My friend, unaccustomed to Chinese noodle soups, was surprised to see how bland the broth was in comparison to say pho or ramen. I agreed, but this is the style of the Chinese and what I grew up with, so I still love it dearly along with pho and ramen!\n\nOverall, this is a great place simple place to either dine in or carry out. The meat hanging in the window is chopped for you and weighed per pound, so you can come and try all the varieties of pork, chicken, and duck that your heart desires to go. I especially liked their selections of egg and rice noodle soups with meat.", "author": "Lianna N."}

I've been to Kam Po twice - first time was several years ago.  All I could remember from that visit was how greasy the food was.  Decided to give it another shot - and yep, the food is still fairly greasy.  Any hoot, more on that later.\n\nKam Po is located on one edge of Chinatown, not too far away from the main drag.  Definitely a hole in the wall, and you'll see a good handful of locals coming in and out to pick up some of their BBQ meat items to go.  Seating space is OK - they have enough room for perhaps 8 or 9 parties.  Yes, their selling point is authentic Chinese cuisine and cheap prices.  Rummaging through the menu, you'll see items in the $4.xx to $6.xx range.  We picked up 3 entrees - beef noodle soup ($4.65), chow fun ($5.10), and roast duck lo mein ($6.00).  Our total including tax  and tip was about $20 and our party of 3 left pretty full.  \n\nI would say the portion sizes are about average for a Chinese place.  I was a little disappointed with the noodle soup - amount of noodles wasn't huge (hence, for a party of 3, each person got a small amount of noodles).  The soup tasted OK, but I thought it was odd that the soup was a little on the greasy side as well.  I like my soups to be hot and comforting - not to leave me feeling like I wouldn't need to use any Chapstick for the rest of the day.  Chow fun was also a tad more oily compared to other places - I know it's normally greasy, but Kam Po seems to like to take it up a notch.  Lo Mein was pretty OK - noodles weren't hugely flavorful, but they put in a decent amount of roasted duck (meaty portions, not just bones).  \n\nService - well, pretty standard for Chinese eatery.  Cleanliness was also on par with your other Asian spots.  \n\nOverall, if you like cheap Chinese food, this is the place.  If you don't like greasy food, this isn't the place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-18", "description": "In a city nearly defined in its culinary circles for the endless array of choices when it comes to inexpensive, very good Chinese food, Kam Po Kitchen deserves to be mentioned in this conversation. \n\nDingy hole-in-the-wall restaurants throughout Chinatown, the Richmond and Sunset districts that specialize in Cantonese cuisine seem to be synonymous for authentic, cheap, very tasty Chinese food in generous portions.\n\nChief among my Cantonese favorite dishes are the Char Siu (roasted or barbecued meats) that always consists of duck, chicken and pork. Other popular dishes include chow mein and chow fun, lo mein, congee (rice porridge), wonton noodle soup with a variety of meats and soups that usually includes lettuce and some type of meat, meat and vegetable rice plates and seasonal vegetables.\n\nKam Po Kitchen had a pretty comprehensive menu list and is known for preparing most of these traditional and uniquely flavored dishes exceptionally well, including what many say are some of the best Chinese noodle soup in the city.\n\nWe reluctantly chose lighter dishes this evening because of our prior dinner reservation at Tony's Pizza Napoletana just a block away and dropped in looking for something to tie us down until then.\n\nThe noodle soup dishes, we figured, were a must-try and not too heavy. A friend also ordered a plate of steamed offals that we could share.\n\nThe mixed innards (offal), $3.95, were a good mix of steamed pig ears, intestines, stomach, gizzards and liver sparsely layered with a soy sauce and sesame oil mix. It was a rich and uniquely flavored, traditional dish that made for a great starter or appetizer.\n\nThe beef tendon noodle soup, $3.75, was a very good choice because they use the peripheral parts of the tendon which carried bits of flesh and fat, giving it a real beefy flavor and a meaty depth. The stringy egg noodles went perfectly with the hearty chunks of tendon and really soaked up the flavor of the delicately seasoned beef broth.\n\nThe shrimp wonton noodle soup, $3.25, had great texture and good flavor in its ingredients and nearly met my high standards for this dish. The gumdrop shaped, succulent shrimp wontons were made with whole shrimp and complemented with a mild soup broth and tasty wide rice noodles that were velvety soft and luxuriously smooth. The broth could have had more flavor. Otherwise, it would have been prepared to perfection.\n\nMost dishes fall under $5. I hope to return and try their Char Siu that they are widely known for to gain a broader perspective on the food here. Upon my one visit, I felt fairly certain Kam Po ranks among the best Cantonese style noodle soup restaurants I have tried. Their shrimp wonton noodle soup, in particular, is worth repeated visits here.", "author": "Andrew K."}

They don't give you any additional sauces for their meats (BBQ, sweet and sour, etc.) and to be honest, you don't really need it.

The soup had a good flavor and the chewy shrimp wontons were even better once I adorned them with a whole lot of chili paste. \n\nBeef Chow Fun - Greasy beefy and awesome!

I basically grew up in Chinatown, and sad to say that it's slowly disappearing. However, the one in SF? WAY different story.\n\nI was hungry and didn't know what to eat. Therefore, I called a friend, who knew the area, to recommended me a place. She said it's something HK on the corner of Broadway and Powell. Wander around, found the place and she told me \"I miss their dry fried noodles.\" So, she decided what I was going to eat.\n\nGoing in, the actual place brought back childhood memories of me as a young one, in Los Angeles Chinatown, having mommy order some food to go, to take home. Or just staring at the dangling ducks behind the glass.\n\nI placed my order in Canton, and asked how long is the wait. Server said, \"not long at all\". And I waited. Not even 5 minutes has passed and BAM! My order's done. I even said, \"wow, it came out REALLY quick\" and the server just smiled.\n\nThe noodles were $5; however, the $5 is filled with grease, with not as much MSG as like how I had the two noodle dishes from Sam Woo's happy hour. Tastewise, it's a bit bland. Not really complaining THAT much because I was able to find a cheap dinner in SF.", "author": "Tom T."}

The portions were huge, and the food was cheap, but the food wasn't the best. \n\nWe ordered a Beef Stew Flat Noodle Soup (Ngau Lam Tong Ho), a Wonton Noodle Soup, and a plate of Cha Siu. The Cha Siu was probably the best part of the meal. It was pretty lean, tender, and juicy. I thought it was seasoned pretty well with salt and savory spices, but it could have been sweeter. It didn't have that glistening glaze on the outside which was kind of a let down. \n\nFrom the outside windows, the noodles soups looked pretty good. It was the main reason why we got them. I could tell that the wontons were all shrimp just by peering through the glass. Despite the really slow service, I was still really excited to dig into my bowl when it arrived. When I took my first bite, my excitement quickly dwindled as the broth and noodles were so bland. The wontons really were all shrimp which is what you'd find in more desirable upscale wontons, but they also lacked any kind of seasoning. My friend's broth was similarly bland, and her beef was tough and flavorless. It was pretty disappointing all around. Maybe the roast duck is better? I guess on the plus side, it's cheap.", "author": "Nei N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-06", "description": "If you're looking for the best roast meats in Chinatown, hands-down it's probably found at Kam Po Kitchen. In fact, rumor has it that they provide the roast meats for several other eateries around. \n\nI believe it's almost 4 years to the day that I stumbled upon Kam Po. I had just moved to the city and got lost in the labyrinth that is Chinatown at night but it was a most fortuitous detour since I found my go-to Chinese roast house. \n\nFirst off the roast duck is just such a guilty pleasure. Wonderfully fatty and tasty with the most perfectly crispy and succulent skin. Order it over rice and you can easily split it into 2 meals. The roast duck in wonton noodle soup is also one of my favorite hangover cures. The plump wontons and the warm soup work in tandem with the duck to get me out of my funk. \n\nIf you've never seen a whole roasted pig come out of the roaster then you need to get here. It truly is a sight to behold when they bring the whole perfectly roasted hog out and hang it on display for all to see. What's impressive is they actually go through more than a pig a day. But wait till you bite into it. The crispy skin is perfection - the kind of thing that makes Anthony Bourdain salivate on camera. \n\nI've had other dishes here ranging from salted fish fried rice to dry fried beef chowfun and they are all decent but the real stars at Kam Po are without a doubt their roast meats. Considering that meals here are so inexpensive (most average around the $5 mark) though, it's hard to order something wrong.\n\nThe service is fast and earnest here especially the lady with the short cropped hair. She is a star here and runs a very tight ship. She negates the attitude from the grumpy butcher.  Don't come here for the ambiance. It's a dive. Order take out if you're afraid of the place but trust me you won't regret it. The food at Kam Po is truly yummy.", "author": "Jon L."}

It was greasy, yes, but wasn't overly so. Super flavorful, delicious, moist, everything chinese roast duck should embody. \n\nHere's where 2 stars (and potentially three) were deducted. I walked in at 7pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was somewhat busy but there were a few tables open. Everyone was already eating already so in theory, I should have been helped right away right? \n\nWRONG. \n\nI was ordering half a roast duck to go. I walk in, say hello. Three guys, include the butcher, look up. No response. The waiter goes back to filling tea kettles. The dishwashers continue washing. The butcher goes back to putting lids on condiment containers full of sauce. NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGES ME. \n\nI literally watched the butcher put lids on 30 sauce containers ( I know bc I had enough time to count all them) and then he started putting them away in a box before I cleared my throat loudly and asked to be helped. \n\nAt that point it was pretty smooth sailing (minus some english/chinese language barriers). Regardless, I understand when you go to Chinatown, especially one known for FOOD, you will get shitty service. This is to be expected.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-11", "description": "This is my new favorite Cantonese restaurant in SF. It reminds me so much of the dirty and grungy restaurants that I frequented when I lived in China -- none of which would ever pass a standard health inspection, but all of which are always crowded because of authentic, delicious Chinese food at outrageously low prices.\n\nIf you can stomach the unsanitary environment (including very questionable silverware -- e.g., deep brown stains on white soup spoons) and don't mind stuffing yourself into a crowded, loud space (during weekend lunch rush hours), then you're in for quite a treat at Kam Po. \n\nI'm actually surprised at how good the service is here -- on the surface, Kam Po should have the laughably-horrible customer service that we've all come to accept and love from Chinatown restaurants. The two waitresses were unbelievably busy, but always made time to come fill up our tea and bring us whatever we wanted. They even cracked a smile once or twice.\n\nThe most entertaining spectacle of the restaurant, however, is the butcher behind the counter, elevated as if on a stage. This is someone who possesses a razor-sharp butcher knife as an extension of his arm, slicing and chopping through pork ribs and duck necks in a way that looked strangely artistic. You could imagine a Beethoven symphony playing in the background as he beautifully butchers the back bones of a suckling pig. Benihana performances ain't got nothing on Kam Po. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nFOOD:\n\nRoast Pork = Incredible. The skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was unbelievably tender and juicy. We got there a little late, so the meat was a little cold from hanging on the hook throughout the morning, but the juiciness wasn't compromised in any way. I can only imagine how delicious it must be immediately after cooking.\n\nRoast Duck = Pretty good. I'm more of a fan of the Beijing-style roast duck with the crispy skin than this kind, where the skin is soggy from sweet and sour sauce. The meat was very tender, but I just don't really like having it drenched in so much sauce.\n\nPreserved Egg & Pork Porridge = Possibly the best preserved egg porridge I've had in San Francisco. There are so many full flavors packed into this porridge that it makes every bite delicious.\n\nGarlic Sauteed Pea Shoots = Loved it. It's a little oily, but the garlic flavors explode with each bite. The pea shoots are very nicely stir-fried, without being overcooked like they usually are. Keep in mind that it's actually pretty-hilariously written in Chinglish as \"Garlic Pea Sharts\" on the menu. I want to give Kam Po an extra star just for that.\n\nTotal: $20 after tax & tip. Yes, it was seriously that cheap.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nKam Po is like a wonderful slice of the true Chinese neighborhood experience. I've tried many restaurants and delis in Chinatown whose food is comparable to (and probably even better than) that of Kam Po, but Kam Po definitely delivers the full experience that I love most about Chinese restaurants.", "author": "Roy C."}

Taking a break from our urban exploring, my buddy and I decided to drop in for some solid Chinese food to fill our empty bellies.\n\nWe decided to sample a little bit of everything and ordered two-item plates of BBQ pork, cold-boiled chicken, roasted pork, and soy sauce chicken over rice.  While the cleanliness is a bit suspect, all of their meats are top quality for a Chinese restaurant.  Everything was very meaty and generally devoid of excessive fat, and the portions were huge.  If we knew that we wouldn't have to walk around with it for the rest of the day, we probably would have taken the leftovers home.  In fact, there was so much food that we probably could have just shared a single plate between the two of us.\n\nWhenever I'm in North Beach, I'm pretty much drawn toward Kam Po for lunch.  It's a fantastic bargain and I would normally be able to make two meals out of the one, saving a lot of time and money while enjoying great food.  For the price of a fast food meal, I can get some of the best, authentic, Hong Kong-style BBQ short of actually going to Hong Kong!\n\nFood: 9/10\n\nService: 6/10\n\nPrice: $\n\nAtmosphere: 6/10", "author": "Joe M."}

Even if I'm stopping by, I'll get a box to go. The best is the roast pork and the FRIED RICE! Omg, the aromas of all the meats mixed together with the rice makes me drool every time. At $4 a rice plate, you really wonder if they are even making a profit. So cheap! And they give you a lot of rice and a side of veggies AND delicious complimentary soup.\n\nDon't come expecting excellent service or anything- the restaurant is CROWDED. You'll be sitting with other people, your tables are less than a foot away, and it'll get awkward. But it's all a part of the experience!

And it came with free house soup.  Given we had to pack the leftovers home, it came to like $3 per person per meal tip included.  That's what I call good price-value ratio.  Actually, that's what I call - \"time to stop cooking because it's cheaper to eat out.\"  That's it.  I'm done with cooking.\n\nI'd had HK Style House Special Chow Mein at a few other places, but they were usually like $10.  Granted you didn't get a tonne of seafood (just shrimp), but there were generous portions of meat.  Instead of being dried gross BBQ pork, their slices were tender.  I guess they must be popular for their BBQ stuff as there was a lineup out the door when I walked in.\n\nDon't use the bathroom though.

In particular the roast duck wonton noodle soup is my favorite in the city. The wontons are super flavorful, perfect ration of meat to wrapper without that weird gummy consistency, and don't make me feel like I'm eating dumpling bought from Costco; and they are definitely not at all skimpy on the roast duck portion which is more than generous.\n\nKam Po is one of those places that actually feels and looks like what one would imagine to be an authentic Chinatown restaurant.\n\nLooking forward to my next bowl of soup!", "author": "David H."}

I was afraid to order the congee (they have a dozen kinds) because it was so cheap (under $3) and no one had ordered any.  Rice and noodle plates seemed to be the most popular items.  You can get pig's feet, organs, kidney, tendon and liver.  We shared a table with a guy who was digging into beef & bittermelon with rice.  It's a full size dish for $3.50!  And you get free hot tea.  Don B. accidentally drank someone else's tea!\n\nI ordered dumplings ($3) figuring that was a safe bet.  You get 7 large dumplings, some bok choy and a shrimpy broth.  The dumplings had very thin skins and they were filled with chopped shrimp, wood ear fungus, bamboo shoots, chives, etc.  They were good but I was hoping for juicy pork dumplings.  These weren't juicy.  I had two cubes of their roast pork - one piece was very chewy and dry and the other was pretty good.  \n\nIt looks like Kam Po has been here forever.

However, they also had a good amount of seating on the inside. There were a good amount of people. Couples, families, and just random people there to grab dinner. It took a while for us to get seated and a menu because there was only one \"hostess\" who was running around taking orders, serving, boxing, and cleaning.\n\nWe got three dishes: beef chow fun, beef broccoli chow mein, and bbq pork over rice; and  we also got a free soup.

It was theeeee best! My brother always ordered the House Crispy Noodles and it was the most magical concoction I've ever heard of. They are noodles that are deep fried shaped like a bird's nest and topped with stir fried meats and veggies with sauce that makes the middle soft but retains the crunchy side of the noodle. It's a great combo. Called Chien Mein (translates as crispy noodles)  and you can have it with chicken, beef or seafood. The house crispy noodles includes intestines or livers, so if you're up for the challenge, try it!\n\nI continued to come back here for lunch without my family when I grew up old enough to go out by myself. I brought my boyfriend here when we first started dating after school since we went to Galileo and he loved the crispy noodles!

It's a pretty filling bowl with several wontons and a lot of roast pork. It's a pretty good deal because I paid about $8 after tip. There's actually quite a huge selection of different dishes... vegetables, rice, meats... pretty much all the standard cantonese foods. The best part about the restaurant is sitting inside facing the counter, and watching everyone at work. There's usually one waitress around who always has a smile on her face. There's another tough looking woman, whose duties revolve around managing the money, the chopping block, and serving customers. She seems like a real strict boss type, but after a while of watching her at work, you'll soon come to see that she's just a really hard-working person who means well. Finally, there's butcher who is never without his cleaver. He might be handling money when he's the only guy behind the counter, but don't misunderstand. He's here to take care of all the meat, from the roast ducks behind the window to the huge slab of siu yuk hanging as the centerpiece of the room. Everything about him from his physical appearance, demeanor, and his skill with the cleaver indicates that he is the embodiment of the original chinese deli butcher.

I've finally discovered the formula to good, cheap and authentic Chinese food!\n\n- Whole roasted duck and chicken steaming from being under heat lamps\n- As many red furniture and decoration as possible. It's for good luck!\n- Handwritten Chinese menu on the wall with the only understandable (to me anyway) characters being the cost. I'm SOOOO tempted to throw a dart at it and order whatever the dart falls on. =D\n- Free mystery soup with your meal. It seems like the soup is whatever leftover that they have in the kitchen - spinal cord, chicken feet, carrots, mystery meat - and then they boil the mess out of it. The soup itself tastes good if you don't think too much or look too closely at what's inside the soup.\n- Chili, soy sauce, vinegar, ground pepper condiments in little containers in the middle.\n- Freaky (to an American anyway) menu items: frog, pig intestine, sea cucumber, hairy mushroom, etc.\n- The waiters are there to take your order, give you food and drink and give you your check. That's it! Don't expect anymore from them. \n- Sticky tables. Ewwww...\n\nThe more of the above that a Chinese restaurant has, the more authentic the food will be. Kam Po has ALL of the above!

I lived in Chinatown most of my life and I have had WAY better bb pork/ roast pork/ and roast duck but this place does the trick. It is decent food for a very cheap price. I come here at least once a week.\n\n4 stars just because its not all that clean or organized...", "author": "Nelson Z."}

It's always a bit cheaper when you get just one item alone but as a carnivore, the combo for me is a must. What has me praising this place is the portions and pricing...two things that pair together well when used right. Look past the \"greasy spoon\" ambience at this place and try it out! You're guaranteed to keep your tummy and your wallet full. Great Food!

It was cheap and tasted good.\n\nThe place itself gets pretty noisy in the busy hours, and the service gets a little slow too, but that's because they have only 2 waiters and it gets really busy around the lunch hour. Cleanliness wise, is just okay. One side there are tables to sit and eat, and there is a small part where you can order to go food.\n\nI was just here in the past weekend, and man have things changed. It used to be that the rice and ho fun tasted pretty decent, but now...We ordered a shrimp chow ho fun, and it was extremely oily, even for chow ho fun, and pretty tasteless. We also ordered a rice with beef and veggies. The beef had a weird taste to it, and the sauce's taste changed too (not sure if it is because they changed the chef or not...). We ate the veggies and some of the rice, but left the beef.\n\nThe last dish we ordered was beef tendon noodle soup. This is the one thing that still tastes great. Even after all these years, their noodle soup still taste the same. The soup base was just as tasty as ever, and they gave a large helping of the beef tendon and noodles. I recommend getting the noodle soups (especially the beef ones) because they are a must try. I really can't say the same for the rice dishes anymore. \n\nThe place is cheap and the beef noodle soups are to die for.", "author": "Jay L."}

There was actually a fly in mine, but I wasn't that surprised...and didn't even really care. First, I was way too full from my dish to have any room for soup.

My dad parks on Russian Hill (because parking sucks in Chinatown) and the view is gorgeous. I can see Alcatraz to my left and houses sloping down and then up into the distance. The sun is out but it's a windy day in SF and I forget to wear my jacket. I'm in a T-shirt and shorts. I get increasingly angry about my attire as I walk around the overpass onto the sidewalk. I see glimpses into shops as I pass by doorways. One is a dimly lit barber shop and another is the behind the scenes of a butcher shop. I make out a slab of roasted pork lying on a metal countertop. We turn the corner and we walk into Kam Po. Kam Po used to be owned by this man in the 90's who gambled a lot. He had two restaurants and had a hot temper. He used to beat his wife and his mother. (ho ma faun uh!) He lost $200,000+. So he gambled until he had to flee the states (jow low) because people were running after him with butcher knives (pack yau). He also disappeared with a truck load of coveted shark fin, sea cucumber and other expensive Chinese delicacies.\nI walk into Kam Po (which really is called Gum bo) and I see my mom at a table so I join her. I'm with my younger brother and mom and dad. My dad talks about the owners and who's working at the restaurant today and who's not. I zone out and observe all of the people in the place. The place is small and I feel very cramped. The table is sticky. The waitress comes over with our cups of tea and our menus. We order. I can see the grime on the laminated menus as she takes them away. There is a red lace curtain that runs along the bottom half of the windows of the place. It serves to just block passersby from seeing you in the restaurant. I can't help but stare at the old lady (ah mo) at the table diagonal to me. She's staring at me too. We have a staring contest and I win. Behind her I see a small closet doorway and men keep walking in and out of there. It's a bathroom. There was a particularly rotund male who had to slip in sideways. I wonder what it smells like in there.\nThe waitress comes by with one of our four orders, a stack of plates, chopsticks and napkins. My brother takes a plate and inspects the bottom of the plate. My dad tells him that's not a good idea. I grab the cleanest plate and pair of chopsticks. My brother exchanges his set for a new one by walking over to the butcher part of the restaurant and grabbing a pair from a mass of red chopsticks. I try our first plate and it's pretty darn tasty. Our second plate comes and my dad says, \"Doesn't this look great (jang!).\" In my head I think, \"no, actually it looks like throw up.\" I eat it and it is pretty good despite what it looks like. Do health inspectors come to Chinatown?\nTo my right, a well dressed teenage couple is ordering food. After they order a gay couple sits down next to their table. One of the two males is white, so the waitress comes to take their order and I hear her say, \"die coke, roas pok mmhmm...vally vally good.\"", "author": "Louisa L."}

Quality is ok. I like it mainly because it is easier to find parking on this part of Chinatown. When I buy I usually bring the exact amount, so that I don't get any change back from the person who chops up the meat -  the change money is always mixed with grease.\nAbout two months ago about one hour from closing, I bought a $6 soy sauce chicken (this is the small size type, cheaper). Got home, open the box, right away I could smell the spoiled odor. Got back to my car, drove back there, looked for parking again, knocked on the door (they closed already) they did not examine the content of my returned box but gave me my refund! From my experience,  the person who chopped up the chicken (I think he is the owner?) should know that it was spoiled because as he chopped it up, he should smelled the bad odor.\nYesterday, I bought another $6 chicken during lunch time (should be pretty fresh at this time of day). Went home and found chicken meat to be rubbery and skin so chewy that I cannot break any skin in the box. Believe me, I have good teeth. I was eating that chicken with a friend (who specifically wanted soy sauce chicken for dinner) at home and it was extremely embarrassing. And frustrated again because the same guy who chopped up the meat should know it was very chewy (from the feel of the knife gets into the chicken). I did not go back to ask for a refund. I think I want to calm down for a few months to ease my blood pressure then see... \nMy family has been in the restaurant business in the East Bay for twenty years.
