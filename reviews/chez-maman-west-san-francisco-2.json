A night doesn't get much better than that. Right now it is a bit difficult to serve me because I am on the Keto diet. The servers were very gracious and understanding of what I needed and made the substitutions I needed \n\nOn our first visit we sat in Alexandra's section. What a great experience. Just got back from Paris in June and eating here makes me feel like I never left. On our second visit Adam was our server. Adam did not disappoint either.  I would definitely ask to set in their sections. \n\nThe steak with the caper mustard sauce is my new favorite. Yes even on Keto. The lamb and harissa is another favorite. The crispy Brussels sprouts are very good. I do the green beans with my steak being I can't eat potatoes. \n\nMy partner had the duck confit and potatoes. He says it was excellent and the potatoes are to die for. The pork was absolutely delicious. \n\nI hope everyone will enjoy this little gem as much as we do.

Whenever there are mussels on a menu I get them.\nI got the mariniere mussels with fries and my friends got the Mac and cheese and the fettuccini carbonara. All of us were very happy with our food. The garlic aioli was a highlight as well as the mussels. These mussels were extremely well flavored and there was free bread to soak up all the broth at the end. At about $15-20 an entree and $40 for a bottle of wine, this is a great place for a dinner where you want to feel fancy but not dress up or pay that extra premium.

I had built up Chez Maman in my head because of its listing on Yelp, and it really wasn't a big deal after all. They have burgers for $13, crepes for $13, and paninis for $12. Take your pic any day of the week. I went for the salmon crepe and the salmon was good. The crepe was a new kind of brown crepe I didn't understand and didn't really like. But it was worth a try, and I would come back. I would have a burger or panini. It's not that expensive for these kinds of menu items. The free bread was good and I had a lemonade(of course). I was by myself. I realized the space is pretty small and doesn't seem to hold that many people in the restaurant, which I figured was like a cafe that wasn't in North Beach. I don't see how you can come here with a big group. It's for a couple of people(maybe 4). It wasn't a high-end dining experience. It's like a North Beach tourist spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-09", "description": "Overview: Chez Maman (pronounced Shay Mama) in Hayes Valley, San Francisco, is a one of two Chez Maman restaurants (the other being in Potrero Hill) that serves burgers and non-pretentious French cuisine at \"average San Francisco\" prices in a small establishment with options for both indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nThe Food: I've had their standard Angus burger with an egg, the veal, steak tartare, and their striped bass here, and found all to be great dishes and decent values in this incredibly overpriced city. \n\nFirstly, their burger is an absolute delight - cooked medium-rare with a runny egg yolk dripping over what I assume is a house-made bun, it hits the spot despite being incredibly expensive for a burger ($16 including egg and a slice of provolone). \n\nThe veal isn't particularly unique but the pricing at $20 is very reasonable given that their cheese burger + egg is $16. \n\nThe steak tartare at $17 is pretty pricey for the relatively small serving size but is prepared well and I did not experience any unexpected bathroom issues in the following days.\n\nThe striped bass is also not particularly delicious or unique but was prepared well and without unexpected bones or off-smells.\n\nThe Service: Expect to wait a lot here but when they do come, the servers are very pleasant and friendly.\n\nThe Establishment: This is a very small restaurant and would not be appropriate for anyone handicapped or for children with strollers unless you want to eat outside. The outside patio is usable if you sit on the inside edge because of their large heat lamps but you sit on the further side, you will likely be uncomfortable when the wind hits. With its prime location on Hayes St right in the heart of Hayes Valley, this place is consistently packed so this scenario where outside seating is open but the inside is packed is encountered more than you would expect.\n\nConclusions: Chez Maman does mostly everything right and it wasn't so cramped inside, the burger wasn't $16, and some of their main dishes had some unique twists, it would hands down get 5-stars from me.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I have already been to their Potrero Hill location before and loved this place, so it was no surprise that they would continue to meet my expectations.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening, we waited an hour at 7:30pm for a table of 4. Considering the fact that the restaurant is pretty tiny, there were only about four larger tables, so I'd recommend coming here with only two --perfect date night spot. They even have some cute outdoor seatings if it's not too chilly out.\n\nOur table started off with their special Les Moules ($16) with a side of Fries ($6). For the les moules, there's four different flavors to choose from. We opted for Marini\u00e8re, which consisted of garlic, white wine, lemon juice, and parsley. It's light, refreshing, and just a bit acidic. To be honest, I did not understand the fries recommendation with the les moules as our entire table enjoyed the fries on its own instead. The side of fries was also rather small and not even fully filled up, but the les moules was great nonetheless to share.\n\nFor my main dish, I tried the popular Chez Maman Basic Burger ($13) with Bacon ($1.50) and an Egg ($1.50). The additions definitely make this a pricey burger. I can see why this burger is highly rated as the patty is so freaking juicy and tender. They actually cooked it perfectly medium too! I also liked that I was able to get half salad and half fries with the burger for a good balance. The only thing I wasn't fond of was that the burger was on ciabatta bread.\n\nAside from the food, the thing that made Chez Maman stand out to me the most had to be their service. Since we waited an hour for our table, we were all starving by the time we sat down. We ended up going through five baskets of bread and probably ten cups of butter before our food came. The servers were so generous to continue to provide us with all our requests. When one person in our party asked for a lot of parmesan cheese, they weren't playing and gave her a huge bowl of it! Now that's what I call amazing service! It's like when the server shaves your cheese and asks you to tell them \"when,\" but they just hand you the entire block of cheese.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

They don't take reservations, and the whole party needs to be present before you can get seated (I was the first one there and all the table was empty at this point, but I guess it's their policy). \n\nFood: The mussels, the fries, the crepe--everything was perfect. If they want to be \"more authentic,\" the mussels really should come with the fries, especially at their price point.

My friends ordered paninis, and I ordered a smoked salmon crepe. The crepe was made of buckwheat and it was quite yummy. The crepe came with a ton of spinach, shallots, fresh herbs, and creme fraiche sprinkled on top.

After I posted my unhappy review, I received an immediate follow-up saying I know we can do better, and we would love to have you come back in any time. So, I went last w/ a friend and we had the best meal. I'm still stuffed this morning. We started our meal off with escargot, les moules, and fries. We ate every last mussel. It was the first time I've tried escargot and I'm wondering where have you been all my life?!?! YUM! The wine sauce for the mussels was DELICIOUS & perfect for dipping my fries and bread in (hint: keep the bread at the table for dipping). Then, we shared an entree. We had the pork chop with Brussels sprouts and the sauce on the pork chop was also delicious. It was apple cider mustard sauce which I also utilized for bread dipping. I started my meal with a red wine and moved onto a Bellini. We finished our meal with my friend's salted caramel gelato and my passionfruit sorbet in champagne. Every single thing was truly delicious. I'm so glad I was invited back... I had a feeling my experience was a fluke.

The flavor was great though, it was just far too rich to finish on my own. Side salad was a basic mixed greens, good portion and flavor. My boyfriends mother got the same thing and loved it, but agreed the amount of cheese was a bit much. \n\n-French Onion Soup 3/5 - similar cheese situation here, it's about 75% cheese to 25% broth. Again, flavors are great though. We all sort of picked at this together. \n\nBeef Tartare- 4/5 I loved this, but my boyfriend didn't like the dijon flavor too much.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "When Bay Area friends stop expressing their understandable disdain for Trump they turn to their second favorite topic du jour, how San Francisco is changing.  So when I tell you that Chez Maman West feels a bit like San Francisco past, that's a compliment.  \n\nChez Maman West occupies a buzzy spot in Hayes Valley.  I've dined here a few times and tried to dine more than that but have been put off by the wait.  They do quite a business, turning many tables in a day.  This is generally not a place at which you can linger.   \n\nThe old-school feelings this place evokes arise from many avenues.  First, there's the space itself.  It's intimate but not fancy or cutting edge.  It's a busy bistro, like one might find in Paris, and it's not glammed up.  It's very comfortable and even solo diners should fit right in, taking a seat at the small bar.  \n\nThe menu itself is a throwback to simpler times.  Chez Maman West seems to be one of the few remaining places where you can put together a very filling meal for around $20 (before wine).  A basket containing sliced baguette and butter arrives on your table without you requesting it and their wine list features many by-the-glass reds, priced at only $8.    \n\nWhile I usually opt for the excellent moules (mussels, $16) and a side of perfect frites (thin, salty, glorious french fries, $6) I ordered the Salade Nicoise ($16, with ahi or salmon; I chose ahi) on a recent visit and found it to be hugely satisfying.  This is a full-meal salad despite the fact that I also ordered the don't-miss frites to share.  \n\nA Smoked Salmon Panini ($12, with salad accompaniment) was reported equally satisfying and, between the table bread, the frites, and the wine, half the Panini was taken home for a second meal.  That's something one rarely reports in the \"new\" San Francisco.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to eat good, well-priced, ample-portioned food while you bitch about Trump, Chez Maman West fits the bill.  Your second topic of choice may, however, crawl to the back-burner as you realize that there's still a few places out there that are keeping the SF of old alive.  \n\nI like Chez Maman West.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Although they had run out of mussels for the night, bummer.. we tried the french onion soup ( yummy but a tad heavy for my liking, but then again what should I have expected), the burger (perfect), and the bass (lovely).

Portions are large enough that if you order the right things it won't break the wallet.\nI got a the smoked salmon crepe. It was much larger than anticipated although it was 80% wilted spinach inside so it's technically healthy... right? The salmon itself was a bit too cooked through for my taste.  The buckwheat crepe however was very nice and filling. I probably wouldn't get it again just because I personally did not love the combination of spinach and salmon, but I have high hopes for the other crepes. \nWe also got the Chez Maman burger which was great bang for the buck. It came with tomatoes, lettuce, and most importantly caramelized onions!!  The burger was pretty good--not bad but clearly not the most amazing burger either.  The aioli that the fries came with was amazing though. Next time I'd just get a full side order of the fries yum yum. \nFood aside, I was not happy with the service. It took almost half an hour after being seated just to get some water.  It's like they didn't even see us. We came at the end of the night and I could see several waiters dallying at the bar so I know it wasn't because they were over capacity.\nOverall, not terrible but not hype level awesome.

We ordered the Mariniere Mussels and the large beef tartar to split. \n\nBeef tartar was delicious! Mustardy and creamy with the cracked (raw) quail egg in the middle. I only wish they provided more than just 5 croutons as there was a lot of tartar. \n\nI've had mussels in France before and the mussels here were ok. I liked them, but some of them at the top were just a little dry. The sauce at the bottom soaked up with a little bread was good and enough to share for two people that love to eat. \n\nThe bread served with the meal was a little stale and sliced somewhat irregularly. It wasn't so bad with a little butter and a soak in a buttery wine garlic sauce though and it didn't stop us for ordering a second basket.\n\nThe service was ok, totally standard, although we did fail to get our waiter's attention once or twice. Overall a nice meal outside in the summer.", "author": "Candice C."}

We had high expectations from the reviews, but found the experience didn't meet them.\n\nFood: \n\nWe ordered moules proven\u00e7ale and fries, the basic burger with salad, and Brussels sprouts and split all the items. \n\nThey dish up good sized portions on everything, which is nice. Hands down our two side items (fries and sprouts) were the best-- crispy and well prepared. \n\nThe mussels were disappointing. About a third were completely closed and undercooked, very difficult to get out of the shell, and tasted gross and fishy. Also, the flavor of the sauce wasn't really evident. \n\nThe burger was meh as well-- not a whole lot of taste to speak of, and the roll was twice as big as the meat, it should have been cut smaller. Also, it came with caramelized onions and tomato on the side, but the onions were served ice cold, which I'd never seen before. The onions didn't add much flavor either.\n\nThe side salad was solid, nothing to write home about. The sliced baguette they served us before the meal was however quite dry.\n\nService: \n\nWe were seated about 15 minutes after we arrived-- awesome for a weekend night without a reservation. The hostess was also considerate and gave us the one available table (eating at the bar was our original option and they don't have different lists for the two). \n\nThe food came out very quickly-- almost too quickly. I suspect that's why the mussels were raw, they didn't take much time to prepare them. It was incredibly busy as well so waiters weren't really going around to refill water or check on us, we had to ask.\n\nOverall rating is below middling since some of the food was good and the service was ok given that they were quite busy. Probably won't be going back.", "author": "Caroline A."}

Had tartare at an actual Parisian restaurant and couldn't get over the fact that I was eating stuff that was meant to be cooked. Stayed away from escargot because snails?? The icky things on my sidewalk? No thanks. \n\nI was ordering the wrong food, I guess. I came to Chez Maman at around 5pm on a Sunday, and although it was a small place, we were immediately seated. There were still some spots open for 2, and a couple tables were unavailable because they were getting ready for a party of 6. We ordered the mussels in mariniere (garlic, lemon juice, white wine) broth, a baked salmon crepe, and the veal in cream sauce. The mussels were very impressive. They came in a little pot, steaming and smelling of garlic. They were so fresh, and when I bit into bread that I'd soaked into the broth? Yum. \n\nThe salmon crepe, in contrast, was a bit flavorless. Maybe the richness of the mussels had dominated by taste buds, but I could barely taste the salmon. All I got was the texture of the crepe, and it seemed like the salmon was only a very thin layer. The veal sauce was really creamy; I couldn't stop smelling it because it seemed like it had permeated our entire table space. Whether this is a good or bad thing really depends on if you like cream. I did, so it wasn't a problem at all. The meat wasn't that tender, but the sauce gave it a lot of flavor. \n\nNext time when I'm braver, I'll come back and try the tartare and escargot.", "author": "Sophie W."}

The bread looked massive; however, the meat patty was big enough to where each bite had a substantial portion of it. In addition, the patty was cooked the way I wanted it as well and was very juicy.

I put my name down for a party of 2 at around 7:50pm, and we only had to wait 25 minutes to get seated. The restaurant is pretty small, and the layout is very compact. They also have maybe 3 tables of outdoor seating on the sidewalk, which might be nice on a warm night or for brunch, but people waiting for their tables do tend to hang around nearby.\n\nService was great! Despite the restaurant being packed, our waiter was very attentive, and the food came out really quickly.\n\nA P P E T I Z E R S\n1) Escargot - These come in the shells with fancy tongs and small forks to help you pick out the meat. I was really intrigued - I'd never had escargot in the shell before! The meat was juicy and just the right amount of chewy. It comes in a butter and parsley white wine sauce, but the sauce left a little something to be desired. I would have wanted it to be a lot more buttery and have a slightly stronger wine flavor.\n\nE N T R E E S\n1) Basic burger + mushrooms + egg with fries - I messed up by not adding cheese to this; it would have made all the difference, but the burger was tasty nonetheless. It comes with two pieces of a rectangular roll sliced in half, instead of a regular bun. The egg was runny, beef patty cooked medium rare, mushrooms piled on top, aioli smothered on the bread. Everything was delicious. It would have been better if the caramelized onions were warm though; they came cold with the veggies and tomato slices.\n\n2) Flat iron steak with fries and green peppercorn sauce - Steak was medium rare and not overcooked. It was on the slightly smaller side, but definitely enough to fill you up. The special green peppercorn sauce on the side added a lot of flavor to the meat.\n\nThe fries were so good!! They were not too thick and really crispy, and the aioli is amazing!\n\nAt the same intersection as Absinthe, I'd probably pick Absinthe over Chez Maman next time in terms of food. They are at different price points though - Absinthe is a bit more costly - so Chez Maman would be the more everyday choice.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

Not that the people of Potrero are a snorefest;  no no no I'm not looking for any trouble. But let's be real, the corner of Gough and Hayes is definitely more happenin'. Especially on a rare warm SF day, this is one of my favorite spots to grab an outside table and take it all in. Grab a glass, or bottle, of wine and you are set my friend.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the service is faster. I swear at the other location, it takes foreeever to get my food and it's not like they're that swamped. At least when I've gone.

Best in SF? After years of extensive research, I still couldn't tell you who has the best burger but this is definitely in contention (aka it's really really good)\n-What I always order: French onion soup & a) a croque monsieur (served w/ salad), b) a croque mademoiselle w/ smoked salmon (technically a croque norvegien, also w/ salad), c) a nicoise salad, or d) a warm goat cheese salad. For the french onion soup and croque monsieur, I mean come on? Who doesn't love the aesthetics of melted gruyere stretching from dish to mouth?! *droolz*\n-What I really recommend: Moules mariniere. Mussels, white wine, lemon juice and parsley-- need I say more? Dip some bread in that sauce and oooo. You. are. bad.\n-What I cannot wait to try: Escargot de bourgogne. My bf is not a fan, but this one time the table next to use ordered the escargot and the decadent aroma of garlicky garlicness kept wafting its way over to my nostrils. Give me some. Now.\n\nTo be honest, I've never had dinner here so I cannot attest to the quality of actual entrees.

A glass of Chardonnay William Hill & Bordeaux Blanc Chateau. The Chardonnay was a little dry at the finish, but both were pretty sweet and easy to drink. \n\nFOOD:\n+ French onion soup ($7) - The most important thing about French onion is the cheese on top - and this one came hot, melty, and amazing. It was so melty i could lift my spoon 6 inches in the air and it wouldn't break! The beef broth was delicious and the onions and croutons soaked up all the broth wonderfully.\n\n+ Les moules mariniere ($16) - a bucket of mussels in a light white wine, lemon juice, garlic, and parsley broth. The mussels were cooked well and fragrant from the white wine. Take my advice: get fries to dip the broth or soak it all up with bread! You won't want to waste any of the broth even after you've eaten all the mussels.  \n\n+ Chez Maman Mac & Cheese ($14) - This isn't ordinary mac & cheese - it has truffle oil swimming throughout. It was the most delicious thing I've had in a while. It came boiling hot to the table, so we waited for it to cool down before digging in. Which was really hard because you could see the cheese bubbling and smell the truffle wafting up... I'm drooling just from thinking about it. Every bite I had was infused with truffle, which was great with the melted gruyere cheese. The semi-crunchy bread crumbs on top soaked up a lot of truffle oil so it was extra truffle-y.  Please please please order this when you go!\n\nI really wish we could've gotten dessert, but that will have to wait till next time - which may not be too long from now!", "author": "Venus F."}

We were told multiple times by the host that we were next, which wasn't the case. After we finally got a table we felt pressured to select a drink almost instantly even though we barely saw the menu and like to pick our wine based on what we eat. When we ordered, we told the waitress we were going to share everything and got a mussels, smoked salmon crepe and seasonal veggies and 2 glasses of wine. Within minutes all of our food was delivered at the same time and no drinks at all. We thought it was very strange they brought everything at once as we were sharing and wanted to start with our mussels then move on to the main dish. They gave us attitude when we asked if they could take the veggies and crepe back to the kitchen to keep warm. When we were ready for it, it was cold and we had to request a new one. \n\nLastly, we decided we wanted another glass of wine towards the end of dinner. Soon after getting the last glass, the host came up to us and asked that if we weren't going to order more food could we move to another table. At that we asked for the bill and left. \n\nConsidering how long we waited for our table, we were upset that we had felt rushed for the entire evening from the second we sat down and thought it was rude that they asked that we change tables while we were still finishing our drinks.

We walked in and it was toasty hot, but soooo cute! Very small place, so if you don't come early, you'll probably wait, no matter the day of the week. They don't take reservations. At first glance, the place looked like a little French cafe/coffee shop, turned restaurant. Minimal art and decor; simple always goes a long way. Nice bench seating along the window, super comfy. The service was awesome. Multiple people kept checking up on our table to see if we needed anything, but not in an annoying sort of way. They seem to come at just the right time! \n\nFor dinner, I kept it simple. I got the Grilled salmon for $17.The usual order comes with a salmon piece, roasted potatoes, fines herbes and creme fraiche. I typically don't substitute my dishes but I'm on this weird diet so instead of the potatoes, I got a salad. It was a delicious spring mix with olive oil and balsamic dressing. The salmon was perfectly grilled and spiced nicely, although the cut was a bit small for the price tag. No worries, I was content when it was all said and done. If you want your money's worth, though, get the burger. It's less in cost and much bigger with lots of herbed fries. Can you guess what my friend had that evening?!\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this place! I can't wait to return and try authentic dishes like the escargot!

This was the first time I had ever visited this location in Hayes Valley.  Frankly, the horrid traffic/parking nightmares as well as tourist hordes inhibits my traipsing in the area but I was meeting a Googler friend of mine there so proceeded with his plans. \n\nI ordered the burger, medium rare, with a fried egg on top.  My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict.  My entree reminded me of my meals at Cafe Claude so while the food experience was good, it wasn't exactly blowing my shoes off.  The bun was too chewy and dense so I consumed only 1/2 a bun.  I should have stuck with the Croque Madam but after being in France, I am a bit hesitant to order anything that might jade my experience.\n\nWe were sitting there chatting after finishing the meal and barely had the credit card returned when the idiot told us we had to give up our seat.  This is after I noticed others from the establishment looking at our table from the inside of the restaurant as well as lurking behind us since we were seated outside.\n\nMy first reaction was that of indignation.  They were telling us to vacate ON TOP of our waiting 40 minutes for the seat in the first place so it seemed\nrather back handed.  Second, the last I checked, restaurants are first-come first-serve, so it's not my problem when new clientele choose to show up at 2:30 for brunch when they technically missed the classic brunch window.\n\nHis lack of customer service was rude and unacceptable.  I didn't even encounter this type of rudeness when I visited Paris twice this year AND at the Michelin rated establishments I visited!

Beef tartare was just okay and thee salad we all shared was decent too (nothing too wow).\n\nI'd have to say my dinner was DELISH.

But then the other menu items aren't that impressive either. I have tried their Fettuccini pasta and Mussels in various sauces. They are decent but not particularly notable. The good thing about Chez Maman is that their line is usually pretty short. Certainly a plus when you are looking for food on a Friday night and everybody is having hour-long wait estimates...

Except it was a little too hot and the awnings here could be larger. As they are now, they do not actually provide any shade. We spent the first part of our meal putting on sunscreen. Also the tables are silver, so we kept our menus to stop the reflective surface from blinding us. \nThe food was good, I personally didn't eat a ton b/c I'm trying not to eat meat or dairy. Not a ton of options there, but the Bloody Mary I had was great #Vegan. I did enjoy that they brought out a bread basket, carbs are the universal language. All my friends enjoyed their meals, good portions for the prices.\nService could have been a little faster.

The host then asked if we were okay sitting outside and we said that was fine. He proceeded to push two small tables (each table alone would only fit 2 people max) together for us. As we sat down, the owner or manager in street clothes came barging out yelling at us. Literally as we were in the process of sitting down he began pulling the table apart saying we could not sit there. We said the host just sat us there and he said he made a mistake and that's not how it works here, in the most condescending and rude tone I have come across at a restaurant.\n\nWe walked back to wait in front of the restaurant in shock and decided to keep waiting since everything else in the area was busy and it had already been an hour. The manager/owner kept trying to seat the other groups of three (2 other groups of 3 behind us) at the tables for 2 and each group refused as the table was only big enough for 2. After 15-20 minutes a group of 4 came up and the manager/owner let them skip the line to push the two small tables together outside. All the other groups of 3 had to keep waiting while a group of 4 skipped ahead simply because he didn't want one chair to be open. That was the last straw and we left along with our business.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't that big of a deal if he was simply polite. If he apologized for the mistake and explained the situation calmly we would have been more understanding... However, I have never been talked to like that or treated like that at a restaurant and I am still appalled. I will never be back to spend money at this restaurant.\n\nIf you look through some of the other reviews you'll see many other customers have had similar experiences with this owner/manager.

A typical Hayes Valley restaurant with tiny tables and not a whole lot of sitting, Chez Maman West is pretty full, but somehow, they keep the rotation going pretty fast. Trying to impress my brother in the ways of San Francisco, I decided on this place in Hayes Valley. The wait was only 10 minutes for a Thursday night. The two person table is pretty tight to another table, but nothing out of the ordinary for San Francisco restaurants. \n\nFOOD: Poulette Mussels. Grilled Salmon. \n\nThe mussels had that umami taste to them. Perhaps it's the taste of the sea with shallots and the white wine or something, but the sauce was reduced beautifully. Not a very overpowering flavor, but everything in the sauce is great. Flavoring the mussels and cooking them to perfection, the mussels were amazing. A definite order here (and make sure to use your bread to get the last bits of sauce at the bottom)! \n\nThe grilled salmon I was less impressed with. The fish was cooked well and the potatoes were fine, but I did not find this dish to wow me.

And you can leave your phone number with the hostess and walk around while you're waiting for a table to open up, and she'll call when a table is free. There is seating both inside and outside. \n\nWe ordered mussels:\nLes moules provencale (tomato concassee, basil, garlic, bell pepper, cream, olives. $15. SO YUMMY. Not that filling but the sauce was delicious. We dipped the baguette bread that we got in it and it was great. That also helps you get more full.

The flavors were so fresh and bright it was almost too good to share but I had to so others could experience the wonderfulness. \n\nThe rest of my part got burgers which were rated ok because the ciabatta bread was too dense and there was too much aolie. The fries were good. We also had two salads and a crepe. The salads were light and delicious. For extra you could get a choice of protein or goat cheese. The cheese was great because it was lightly fried. The crepe was very good but had way too much cheese in there compared to crepe and mushroom. \n\nService was ok.

This is your spot, despite multiple other \"brasserie\" restaurants in the area. Food is solid, prices are fair, service is adequate but the mussels make up for it. Don't bother coming here if you're on a diet, though... you've been warned.\n\nFRENCH ONION SOUP: Get at least one for the table to share. It's not the best version I've had in town but the broth is delicate, the cheese is rich, and there are ample onions.  This was much better than the soup du jour (some sort of vegetable blend with parsley oil).\nBAKED CAMEMBERT: Served with a hunk of roasted garlic and a handful of toast points, this was a hit at our table and quickly devoured. Creamy, stringy cheese on crunchy toast with soft, spreadable garlic. How can you go wrong?!\nESCARGOT DE BOURGOGNE: Served in the shell with that fun eyelash-curler tool to hold them still. Also not my favorite version, as it's not as easy to sop up the tasty garlic sauce. \nBEEF TARTARE: Two sizes available, interestingly spiced, served with toast points and quail egg. This was received to mixed reviews at our table.\nSMOKED SALMON PANINI: Herbs, creme fraiche, capers, and caramelized onions. It's as close to a bagel and lox as you can get, if you're in a brunchy mood.\nMUSSELS MARINIERES: Pot of traditional mussels served in garlic, white wine, lemon juice, and parsley. Generous portion, robust broth, go ahead and side it with the frites.\nFRITES: So crispy! Thin potato sticks with parsley and a tasty aioli. Simple but well executed.\n\nBeers and wines are available, single unisex bathroom toward the back, bar seating if you're dining solo, al fresco tables a better option in the evening.

I've had this place bookmarked for a while and decided to come by. The menu looked absolutely wonderful and between that and the decent food I'll definitely be back. The food was more around the 3.5 range for me but with the good service I decided to round up.\n\nI was seated at the bar which is nice cause there were actually quite a few people eating alone there so I felt less awkward. I ordered the mussels poulette w/ fries and the beef tartare.\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the tartare. It's not my first time having it and it is definitely the most seasoned one I've had but to a point where it was overpowering and I generally prefer places to go overboard with their seasonings/herbs. But the amount of capers (and possibly mustard) was just too much. Maybe it was just the batch I got, but powering through the dish was difficult and sad since the beef itself was actually quite good (3/5)\n\nThe mussels were definitely the better of the two dishes. The stock was very flavorful though I kind of which I got the Mariniere instead because the Poulette is very heavy. The mussels are fairly tender and fresh compared to a lot of places that have little rubber pieces of mussel instead. The fries were also well seasoned though they could be fried a bit longer since some of them were limp.\n\nAll this plus the wonderful servers and nice dine-alone atmosphere definitely means I will be coming back.

The fries and garlic aioli is to die for! Trust me, I am a french fry connoisseur. \nThe Veal with Mushroom Sauce- I feel like the sauce is what makes the dish. Super delicious!

We walked around the area which had some nice dessert and clothing shops, for about half an hour. Then they called us and we came back, and were seated outside. There were heat lamps, so it didn't feel very chilly. We got the spicy lamb sausage for starters. I liked the flavors, which wasn't too spicy and came with a dry red pepper paste, and horseradish sauce. \nNext was the mussels. Unfortunately it was not seasoned enough. Salt was not available, so I just ate it as the way it came out.\nThe basic burger was very good. It came with caramelized onions, tomatoes, lettuce. We added goat cheese which made the flavors come out so much better. The beef was medium rare as we requested. The fries were fine, crispy. A bottle of ketchup was provided, woohoo, because we love using a lot of ketchup on our burgers. I know it's not looked well upon but ketchup just tastes SO good with a nice burger.\nOverall, I'd give this place 4 stars like many others.

Since it's almost always busy, I don't think I'm giving away some secret here. Day or night the service is amazing. The waiters, bus men and hosts all convey a welcoming, fun & great attitude. Sure, I'm a regular, but I witness consistent service to all who come to dine. \nIf you're looking for some fine dining candle lit experience, this probably isn't for you. Not that the food isn't simply wonderful, it is, any item on the menu is executed with care and flavor. CM is a place for a good satisfying meal at an affordable price. Linger if you want, I've never ever been rushed out, but it really is a place to dine, enjoy and go soon after the check is paid-- to me anyway. Keep in mind this is a Bistro- -It's better to me when dining solo or in 2's because of this. It's a bit loud, just like a modern French bistro. No Edith Piaf singing through the speakers here. Expect Reggae or Motown...it adds to the charm. Bonus: they are open late- which has saved me more than once coming off a late night flight. I don't come here because there's nothing to cook in my house, I come here because it's really good food.\nI've had almost everything on the menu- the stand outs for me are:1. Soup of the day- never had one that I didn't scrape the bowl clean with the fresh Acme bread. 2. Mussels- brothy and steaming- sooo good 3. Goat cheese salad- practically an entree. Actually yes, it is my entree more times than not. 4. That burger. Mon Dieu! Always satisfying. 5. Fries- just like Paris. Only better. Go ahead, carb out. They're worth it.  6. Crepes and Salads-- Perfect if you want something, but not a full meal. 7. The chicken is delicious. \nBeer and Wine- Nice selection of beers on tap. Wine is chosen to match the food. Get over your California wine thing and have a glass of Bordeaux. \nI'm pleased Chez Maman is a success here in Hayes- I used to go to the one on the P-Hill, but 8 years ago God smiled and gave me one only a few walking minutes from my house.", "author": "Little W."}

If beef isn't your protein of choice, they also offer chicken, fish and a vegetarian burger with toppings of your choice (outside of the usual lettuce, tomato, and onion) at an extra $1.50 each. I love the bread they use. It seems slightly too large for the patty until you start adding in the veg. Then it's perfect!

Chez Maman in Potrero to try their highly touted burger, and recall being a bit underwhelmed. I decided to give Maman another try at their Hayes location, and am so glad I did. \n\nThe thing that was really knocked my socks off was the nicoise salad. I know. That sounds crazy. How could a salad knock my socks off?! Well, let me preface that with the fact that I RARELY order salads. It is usually very mediocre looking/tasting and generally, when I go out I prefer to order things I can't easily make at home. My office often caters what seems like the worst and most basic salads from Specialty's and Focaccia. That being said, how often are salads amazing?\n\n* Nicoise Salad ($16) - 5 STARS: This entree sized salad includes 3 large, fresh pieces of seared tuna, olives, peppers, green beans, potatoes, eggs & tomatoes. It was topped with olive tapenade, balsamic viniagrette, and a light drizzle of olive oil. So refreshing, and just perfect all around. Someone complained about the potatoes (mine were intact finger potatoes), the hard tomatoes (yes they are not very ripe), but having returned a second time the dressing was as delicious and refreshing as I remember. \n\n* Mariniere Mussels ($) - 3.5 STARS: I love mussels. The mariniere includes garlic, white wine, lemon juice & parsley. For some reason I expected tomatoes... (marinara?). It was clean, basic, and strongly tasted like white wine. My favorite spot for mussels is Anchor, and for a French mussel dish I prefer the flavors at La Trappe and the quantities/flavor at Baker Street. Maman is unique because the broth / soup is much cleaner and simpler. Make sure to order with fries!\n\n* Burger (~$11) - 3.5 STARS: apparently a common way to serve burgers is plain, and to charge for every single ingredient. I especially loved the bread and garlic spread, the seasoned lettuce and grilled onions. I wasn't a big fan of the add on fee for cheese bacon avocado mushrooms...

So...I brought up trusty ole yelp and chez maman popped up as the first choice in the area.  What the heck?  Why not?\n\nWe headed over to the gough location and I am so glad that we did.  We got there early enough to pick up a table right away.  The restaurant is small, cozy, a nice place for date night.  \n\nThe service was spectacular.  We never had to call a server for anything.

SO GOOD.  \n\nMy mom is a tough critic...and she loved every single dish we ordered.  Here's a breakdown:\n\nAppetizer:  French onion soup - all 3 of our spoons were battling for the delicious cheese baked on top of the soup.  This had to be the best French onion soup...EVER.\n\nMom's entree:  basic burger with guac, bacon, and cheddar served with fries and aioli.  Yum.\n\nWifey's entree:  carne asada quesadilla.  I didn't even get to try this bad boy because I was hoovering down my dish.  Apparently, mom and wifey agreed it was good stuff.\n\nMy dish:  pork chop with brussel sprouts and some sort of mustard sauce.  I asked the waiter ahead of time what his favorite entree was.  This was his choice without any hesitation.  Thank goodness for his choice.  Amazing.  So amazing that it was lick the plate clean material.

The table that was suppose to be ours next took forever to leave even after paying the bill, but the service was impeccable! The hostess kept offering us to grab drinks and even seated us inside to wait where it was warm. We were served by a male waiter, but unfortunately forgot his name - but he was super awesome! He always checked up on us, joked around with us, and accommodated to our requests without hesitation - super friendly and inviting. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers between 3 girls: \n- French onion soup: bit too salty for me, but my friends loved it.\n- Escargot: flavorful and cute utensils to clamp them to eat. For my friend that wasn't into seafood, she didn't mind the taste - which is good!\n- Beef Tartare: one of my favorite appetizers of the evening - the beef tasted really good on top of the bread pieces, especially with the yolk all over the beef. Super flavorful and would order this again when I return\n- Truffle Mac & Cheese: This order is normally an entree, but the waiter accommodated us by making it an appetizer and charging us half the price for an appetizer-sized dish. The truffle was a strong and delicious taste in the mac and cheese, and was my other favorite appetizer. The cheese was perfectly cooked to be stringy even after sitting awhile it was still cheesy-good\n\nFor dinner I had the Basic Burger with fries and added bacon and avocado for $1.50 each. By the time I went through half my burger, I was too full from all the appetizers. My patty was suppose to be medium-rare, but it was too charred and a bit more cooked than I expected. Other than that the fries were tasty and thin, which paired the burger better by being less heavy. I liked that the burger came with the lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the side so you can put as much as you want yourself. My friends had the Striped Seabass and the L'Orientel Crepe. We all only ate half because we were too full, but we all enjoyed it. I didn't get a chance to really try my friends, but I did a piece of the crepe. I tasted some sort of goat cheese, but maybe I am wrong - but because I don't like goat cheese, I didn't like it and barely touched the piece my friend cut out for me.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the waiter came out with a complimentary creme brulee for us! - Awesome service! :) Definitely will be back.", "author": "Amanda C."}

Drinks were ordered and bread with butter were brought to the table quickly.  I went with their savoyarde crepe, filled with fingerling potatoes, prosciutto, shallots, swiss cheese and cornichons.  My husband, who wanted something light, went with the chicken apple sausage omelet, which tomatoes, peppers and jack cheese.  Both of our dishes came with a light salad.  I kinda wish I added egg to my crepe as it was much lighter than I wanted.  The omelet was good, but the chicken apple sausage was served on the side which we didn't expect.  \n\nService was prompt and professional.

Everything we ate was not only pleasing to the eyes, but pleasing to the nose, and to the taste.  The service was very accommodating with recommendations of what to try.  The French onion soup was so delightful.  I am not a big Escargot fan, but we ordered enough food to sample each others, and I have to say that the garlic sauce that the Escargot was in made the meal.  It was so very flavorful.  All of the sauces that came on the plate from the veal to the porkchops were fragrant and simply delicious.  We all found ourselves sharing simply because we wanted to taste as everyone made a remark of \"Oooh, ahhhh,\" as they bit into their food.  The desserts were also amazing.  I am a cr\u00e8me brulee fan and it was so light and creamy.  We tried the pain perdu as well.  I was thrilled at how delicious it was and how it complimented the evening perfectly.\nThe only drawback to this evening was that we did have to wait a while to be seated, but being that it was Bastille Day, that was understandable.

I've been to the original Chez Maman at least six times but only ate there twice if you know what I mean. That place is tiny with a small 't' - only ten counter stools, a couple of tables, and one often very long, rather tattered sign-up sheet on a lonely clipboard. I really like it still, but the prospect of waiting for a counter seat on a chilly evening in Potrero Hill started to lose its appeal after my fourth failed attempt. That's why I was happy to see owner Jocelyn Bulow open a second location in the more convenient setting of Hayes Valley at the corner of Hayes and Gough right across from Absinthe.\n\nAlas, the corner location where Essencia was is also a tight fit, not as tiny but a compact fit for such a popular bistro. In fact, it's extremely rare to see an open seat around the dinner hour, so I seized the moment late last Saturday afternoon and parked myself at the end seat of the counter at 4:30PM. Too early for dinner? Well, you should talk to my dad, the king of the early-bird specials. I was determined to try it while the opportunity was there. Who cares that I heard the constant crash of silverware in my ear? My order was predictable. Of course, I got the $11 Basic Burger and added a couple of $1.50 extras, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a fried egg. It's a specialty of the house, and you can just tell.\n\nAdd the tomato slices, mixed green and ramekin of aioli, and you have quite a feast between two halves of a grilled ciabatta bun (see photo). The medium-rare hamburger itself is quite flavorful since it contains shallots and herbs, which strikes me as quite a Gallic touch. Somehow a side salad wasn't going to do it for me. No, I needed the frites which were plentiful and delicious - small, crisp, salted and not too greasy but still greasy enough to feel guilty about them. Oh, did I forget to mention the complimentary basket of thick baguette slices with a huge chunks of farm-fresh butter you can spread with zeal and excess?

There are no foams, gels or molecular gastronomy at CMW. Their concept is to serve food your mother used to make ... if your mother was French and ran a bistro. However, I think this food must have been ubiquitous in every American gentleman's club, restaurant  or country club in the 60's and 70's. This isn't groundbreaking, gourmet or chi chi food. This is classic French comfort food done well. \n\nWe were a group of 3 for dinner last night. We added our names to the list at around 5:39 pm. A group of 5 before us said they had been waiting for 2 hours. No reservations are taken. We were a little hesitant as the hostess said the wait would be at least an hour. We were pleasantly surprised when we snagged an inside table just 30 minutes later. Space is tight so be prepared to suck in that spare tire and apologize for bumping into other guests as you squeeze into your table.\n\nWe started with Escargot de Bourgogne. Six snails are cooked in their shell with parsley, butter and white wine. The snails were tiny and I felt they were just a vehicle for the sauce. I always try to obey my beloved grandmother who always told me to not leave food on my plate. Therefore, each of us had to request a whole basket of bread to sop up all that saucy goodness, delicious carb overload. Expect garlic breath. On hindsight, probably not the best thing to eat just before going to the Orpheum for a show. To the stranger seated to my right, I apologize for any unintended aromatic vapors I sent your way. \n\nOne friend ordered the lamb and vegetable brochettes. Two skewers were served with couscous and a pesto mint coulis. The lamb was tender but I think this dish had more veggie than lamb. This was the most expensive dish of the 3 entrees but delivered less bang for the buck. Another friend ordered the Veal with a creamy white wine sauce and mushrooms. The sauce was rich and the veal was tender. \n\nIf my own dish wasn't so hearty, I would have begged for a bigger taste of her meal. I ordered the pork chop with brussel sprouts and an apple cider mustard sauce. The pork chop was good but I think the sprouts and the sauce stole the show. The sprouts were roasted with bacon. Coupled with some of the sauce and it was a perfectly salty, sweet bite of heaven. \n\nFor dessert, we all shared a crepe Suzette and a crepe tatin. The Suzette was stuffed with orange butter, sprinkled with sugar and doused with Grand Marnier. Our server fired the dessert but the flames didn't last long. It was still quite boozy when we ate it. The crepe tatin was a bit disappointing. The filling was cold and reminded me of apple pie filling. Since we were expecting hot, caramelized apples, it was just OK. It may have been our fault since we told our server that we needed to finish dinner in time to get to the theater. \n\nMy friends and I enjoyed a perfect night where the stars all aligned to give us a fun evening of good food, great camaraderie and a pair of Kinky Boots.", "author": "Cece E."}

Located next to Dobbs Ferry (how is this place still open?) and across from Absinthe, it's sure to give both of them a run for their money.\n\nThe French Proven\u00e7al menu mirrors their Chez Maman location in Potrero Hill, however, they've added organic Mexican bistro fare offerings from the Papito menu. Everything is affordably priced at $6-$19. \n\nSusy C. and I came to Chez Maman for dinner on opening day on Monday. This location is larger than their original location with tight table seating for about 24 people and bar seating for about 6 people. Good for parties of 2-4 only. \n\nWe both started with a bowl of their French Onion Soup ($6) which was rich and robust with a delightful sweet nuance from the caramelized onions. It wasn't as cheesy as the one at the original location (no ooeey gooey cheese overflowing around the edges) and some of the toasted baguette slices were brunt but I'll chalk that up to opening day jitters. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Uu6ZUq06tAnfqwOR2ScPFg?select=yuUlrDkj2WJVgv2XwqkZgA#3uneu9w-NXaPRmVDMMefUg We then shared a half order of the Steak Tartare ($8) which was fantastic. The soft beefy morsels had a savory creamy sweetness with a zing from the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, capers, and egg yolk. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Uu6ZUq06tAnfqwOR2ScPFg?select=yuUlrDkj2WJVgv2XwqkZgA#yuUlrDkj2WJVgv2XwqkZgA\n\nAlthough Chez Maman is best known for their mouth-watering burgers and savory crepes, I was trying to be mindful of my carb intake and didn't want to look like a carbphobic douche ordering a burger without a bun, so I went with the Moules Poulette ($14) for my main. Arriving in a rustic iron pot, the sweet and tender mussels were in a wading pool of creamy white wine broth with shallots and parsley for a pop of freshness. There was a generous amount of bacon bits which gave an extra layer of richness. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Uu6ZUq06tAnfqwOR2ScPFg?select=CaeMgzyLlE83jqYNrhKTrQ#CaeMgzyLlE83jqYNrhKTrQ\n\nService was good considering it was their first day but was missing the warmth I've experienced at their original location. Food took a bit longer than anticipated to arrive though. I'm hoping they'll iron out this kink soon as I would like to return for lunch since it's near my office. \n\nHaving dined at all of their restaurants except for Papito (links to my reviews below), I have to say, the original Chez Maman in Potrero Hill is STILL my favorite. \n\nChez Maman (Potrero Hill): http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-maman-san-francisco#hrid:9yXW3HWWyFTcCCArt-6MmQ\nChez Papa Bistrot: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-papa-bistrot-san-francisco#hrid:9c4tBbr8jSf3Xv3J8zobWg\nChez Papa Resto: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-papa-resto-san-francisco-4#hrid:N22eqRnmUXCf_OKoSVK06A\nGamine: http://www.yelp.com/biz/gamine-san-francisco#hrid:BIkbRS99s95hVxf8XNT_rg\n\nFirst Borns Rock!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Mussels were cooked perfectly,  not a single one was tough and rubbery but seriously that sauce... that sauce...\n\nYou guys will should expect me to pop in for lunch and expect me often, merci! \n\nIf you'll excuse me I must proceed to lay in food coma as this is the most food I have consumed in 24 hours.

This place has no AC or air circulation, so even when it cooled down around 7pm, it was an oven inside. I'm pretty sure there was a 10-15 degree temperature difference. If that dining experience (minus the food) was any indication of what it's like to burn in hell, I am definitely going to stop committing sins.\n\n- French Onion Soup ($6): BEST French onion soup I've ever had in my life. I'd totally go back just to get this! Hell, I'd order three of these bad boys on its own!\n- Basic Burger ($11 with $1.5 add ons): Yelpers rave about this burger (especially with the brie and egg), but I just couldn't stomach this burger. It tasted a bit too heavy for my liking.. I blame it on the heat, but I would be down to give it a second chance. The burger comes with loads of fries!\n- Mussels - Poulette - shallots, bacon, white wine, cream & parsley ($15): although the mussels were a bit on the tiny side and a little dry, the sauce that it comes in was super flavorful. They don't mess around, that's for sure.\n- Chez Maman Mac & Cheese - shaved truffles, truffle oil, cheese ($14): you can definitely skip this dish. For an entree, the portion is not that huge. The mac n cheese was so bland, we had to pile on the salt. Although they have truffles and truffle oil, I can probably make better mac n cheese at home.\n\nAlthough the environment was less than ideal, I'm going to excuse it since SF probably deals with hot weather once in a blue moon.

This cute, small restaurant can get quite crowded- the locals know that this place is awesome, because there's a line out the door at times! \nThey have a variety of mussels, which seems to be their specialty. I opted for the Mussels Mariniere with frites, while my dining companion had the Thai Mussels. Both of them were stellar. I've never had mussels this good. The sauce was out of this world. I can't rave enough about how great these things were. The fries were crisp, salty, and a perfect match for the mussels. They came heaped in a giant bowl, with unlimited bread to come along with it to soak up the delicious sauce. I could go on and on and on about how I loved that sauce. \nThe Thai mussels were served with a similarly delicious sauce- made from basil and coconut milk. Incredible. Absolutely incredible. \nThe service was stellar. Our waiter took excellent care of us. When he found out that we were from San Antonio, Texas he told us about how the Spurs head coach likes to eat here regularly, and goes for the Mariniere also. Food of champions. \nThe restrooms were clean and spacious. In fact, the whole restaurant was clean. The decor was comfortable. \nWe watched as the table next to us struggled to find their best vegetarian dish. It seems that they have a few options- the waiter recommended their mac & cheese, but they weren't having it. However, they did go for the French onion soup that looked absolutely amazing- melted cheese formed a layer over the soup, and it smelled divine!  The prices were quite fair, considering how unforgettable the food was here. After having less than exciting seafood in the Golden Gate City, this place was a refreshing, and exciting change from the rest. I've got to honestly say, this was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had.

I know there's not much to it, but it really was great. We also ordered the Mariniere mussels to start and they were divine! The sauce was extra garlicy (which in my opinion is a plus) and perfect for dipping the bread in. The mussels tasted really fresh and they gave us a good amount of them. \n\nSince I was still in brunch mode, I ordered the smoked salmon panini with french fries and split that and the croque madam with my sister. Both of the sandwiches were phenomenal! The smoked salmon was served with a creme fraiche and the croque madam was cooked perfectly. The french fries were also very good, perfectly salty! My father ordered the veal, which came in a white wine mushroom sauce and was served with fresh veggies, was to die for! I never thought I liked veal, but I would order that any day.\n\nThe service at Chez Maman was also great...it's a small restaurant, so it is kind of expected when you only have so many tables.

Everything was delicious. The french onion soup came out piping hot was packed full of flavor. I love french onion soup and I was impressed. The mussels were also very flavorful. The mussels were juicy too. I took their complimentary bread and dipped it in the mussel sauce. yummmm. And you can never go wrong with french fries. Their fries were thin cut and crispy on the outside. Their aoili was delicious too.\nSurprisingly, we were very full. They give a good amount of mussels, so definitely a dish to share.\n\nI would definitely recommend others to come for their mussels.\n\nParking is typical Hayes Valley, can be very difficult to find street parking.

I was a bit worried about this as I don't generally eat raw beef, but it was delicious.  It had a tangy flavor and was very tender.\n-Flat Iron Steak w/ Frites ($21)- Steak was somewhat tender and a bit small - not the best.  However, I did like the Peppercorn sauce on the side.

Excellent service, as we walked in and throughout the meal. Bread and butter served promptly, and food came out expediently. I have to say, chunky layers of cheese and onions made for a delicious appetizer. I agree with my girlfriend in that I wish they baked their own bread because the Acme loaf we had was a little stale, but the mussels in a white wine butter broth and herb-flecked fries with garlic aioli made that all better. Plus, the bread was easy to soak in. For three different plates to share, it was only $40 with tax and tip. That isn't bad at all, and the mussels were cooked perfectly so that they weren't rubbery and came right out of the shell. Extra bread was asked for and graciously given to sop up the white wine broth. Good times were had by all, especially the boisterous restaurant manager and waitress. Escargot and steak frites next time for sure. And, most likely a glass of wine or two. Remember though, this place is tiny, so make a reservation. You'll thank me later for that one.", "author": "Danny C."}

I first loved that we didn't have to wait long after waiting for almost half hour in Brenda's and realizing that we would have to wait for another half or another hour we decided to head that to chez maman. There's lots of variety on the daily menu, so each of us had our piece of brunch and lunch even though the weekend brunch was not being offered, we came on a holiday weekend.\n\nThe host of this particular restaurant was great, she was polite and quickly found us a table. Our server was French, refreshing, and a bit rushed or rushing us...hence not the five stars on this review, but maybe it was a cultural thing, yet refreshing.\n\nWe came in around noon on Labor Day, my friends had mimosas, I had an IPA. I honestly think the mimosas were overpriced, but they indeed have a great wine selection at affordable prices. It was way to hot, and a beer was on my mind to beat the heat and luckily they have a great selection of light and strong beers.\n\nAs for the food, I was very much wanting to order the Mac and cheese, I live for truffle mushrooms and cheese, but I assumed it would be too big of a portion so I decided to order one of their burgers since these are more often reviewed, well reviewed. I order the regular burger with an egg and goat cheese and fries on the side. The fries were just ok, but the burger was juicy and  tasted pretty damn good! So much flavor, I loved it and the patty was cooked perfectly. The egg was also cooked to perfection and combined with the goat cheese was truly amazing. \n\nOne of my friends ordered a crepe and the other one the croque Madame, the latest looked great from where I was seating, but I don't think they were too amazed by their meals. We ended up with some coffee, cappuccino. \n\nOverall was a great first time here. Great flavors, tons of variety on the menu, but feeling rushed was the one thing I would say Is due for improvement. Good news, it is Not as pricey as I expected, and it definitely is a small and cozy place great for dates or just to hang with close friends.", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

We ordered the escargot de bourgogne, beef tartate, chez maman mac and cheese, les moules - provencale, and veal. Service was prompt and the staff was nice to accommodate our schedule.\n\n***Food***\nThe meal started with complimentary bread and butter, the bread was pretty good and we ask for more to have with the escargot butter, garlic, herb sauce, and for the broth produced from cooking the mussels. Still water was provided along with a wine drinks menu.\n~Escargot de Bourgogne\nEscargot has very good flavor, buttery, garlicky, and a lot of parsley flavor. They were not over cooked and chewy, not under cooked and slimy. Unfortunately they removed all the organs so it was quite small, when left with only the foot and body.\n~Beef Tartare\nBeef was sliced to about a 3-5 mm size cubes, making it easy to eat. I didn't get any sinew in my pieces and the quail egg yolk on top brought a good creaminess and also acted as a sort of binder. Dijon mustard brought a good heat to the dish, capers added a little salt, with the shallots adding some texture. Bread was nicely toasted and acted as a good platform for the beef. It needed small a pinch of salt to better bring out the flavor and a crack or two of black pepper for seasoning.\n~Chez Maman Mac and Cheese\nSlightly disappointing because the group was looking forward to the shaved truffles as seen on the menu online and by the door. We was served good mac and cheese with truffle oil, which isn't the same, nor an ingredient I would use in my cooking.\n~Les Moules - Provencale\nMussels was seasoned and cooked very well with the beard removed and no grit in the cream and mussel liquoer.\n~Veal\nVeal ever so slightly over cooked, but when paired with the sauce it was perfectly fine. Vegetables was cooked well, with zucchini and yellow squash no over good, and the carrots had a good texture.\n\n***Greeter, staff, wait***\nThe greeter was nice and showed us a menu as we waited. She occasionally came by to update us on the wait. We waited for about 30 minutes for a table, where two ladies was taking their time and idling for 3 hours was what we was informed by the hostess. Staff was very nice and when we informed them we was trying to eat quickly to meet our 8:00 pm performance, our food came out very quickly. We also had a complaint about the Chez Maman mac and cheese; on the menu online and by the door, it has shaved truffles included in the list of ingredients; and the staff was very kind to not include it on our bill. We also asked for additional bread, to have with the broth from the mussels, which was brought promptly, so good.\n\n***Ambiance***\nAmbiance is nice, but the space is quite small and we was seated very close to the next table. We was fortunate to be seated and by the window, and the lighting was nice, with the exterior lighting and interior melding together.\n\n***Parking***\nNOT INCLUDED IN RATING\nI tried parking as close to the Symphony Hall or the restaurant as possible, which proved difficult, but when I easily found parking on Van Ness between Hayes and Fell St.", "author": "Frank T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-06-20", "description": "This place is terrible.  Sat down to an early dinner around 5, was waited on promptly and with a smile. The interaction of ordering was the last thing to not be a disaster. I ordered the burger (medium rare) with cheddar, and selected Fries as the menu said the burger came with \"fries or salad.\" About 15 minutes later I was presented with shoestring COSTCO/SYSCO fries covered in parsley. Flavorless, bland, frozen french fries that multiple fast food chains can do better then....The menu said the burger would be coming with Tomato and Caramelized onions; what the burger DID come with was two slices of tomato cut so close to the top that the stem core was still present and a side pile of cold slimy \"once upon a time\" grilled onions. The cheese was four tiny slices that appeared to have come from a pack of pre-cut cheese used to serve cheese and crackers.  The burger was cooked far past medium well, never mind the medium rare i ordered.  There was also a tiny pile of slimy lettuce on my plate....I suppose the \"fries or Salad\" option wasn't really an option.  So i show this cold pile of slimy onions to the waitress and ask if I could get some freshly grilled onions; she informed me that they did not currently have any \"warm grilled onions\".....I ask if they have any raw onions to which she tells me they do, so I tell her I don't mind waiting, and OH could you bring some tomato that doesn't have a stem in the middle?......A few minutes later she came back to the table with two slices of tomato that ALSO had the stem in the middle ( i have NEVER seen this problem....how the hell does this place only have slices of tomato that come from the first centimeter of the tomato?) as well as a plate of raw onions.  I was half tempted to take the plate of raw onions into the kitchen and just caramelize them myself. Upon returning with these items the waitress promptly through them down and walked away..... she did not ask how anything was.  I spoke earlier of how my burger was extremely over cooked, it was at this point in the story I discovered this.....having given up on the \"caramelized onions\" or a decent slice of tomato ever happening I simply shrugged and attempted to enjoy my food.  I took one bight, realized how incredibly chewy and over cooked the meat was and set it back down.  We then sat at our table for 15 minutes trying to make eye contact with a waitress while not touching our food. No one acknowledged us or asked how the food was.  I finally stood up and asked the first person I saw if their was a manager around.  I explained our meal and the (few) interactions we had had with the waitress.  The \"manager\" seemed flabbergasted and told us she would remake things if that would help, we were already late (hence the early dinner) and simply had to go to our event hungry. \n    This place tries to look and act like a french restaurant but it is simply a place that reheats frozen food.  I doubt their kitchen actually makes anything. Attention to detail is important when running a restaurant and this place doesn't have it.  The bread we received was half fresh and half stale; the first plate of better was warm while the second plate was straight from the fridge.  I assume the good reviews for this place are from the people sitting at tables who didn't grab the stale bread and had a little too much wine to notice they were being ripped off. If you want to spend less then 20 a plate and don't care that you could microwave the same level of food at home, this place is for you.", "author": "Dave S."}

We waited for 25 minutes and 2 out of 5 guests were 10 mins late but we ordered wine for the table regardless- I admit and should have been on time. The manager/owner came down to our table about 4 times in 5 minutes and the rest of of the staff hovered around the table constantly asking us where they were and we felt awful. We genuinely felt bad and apologized many times until .... the manager said that we had lied and told the waitress that the other guests were in the bathroom when we had never mentioned anything of the sort. So we offered to give up the table and put our names down again until our party arrived but they arrived just in time.... so we stayed and the staff seemed happy. Everyone working was so lovely and the food was delicious but the owner/manager made us never want to go back. \n\nWe felt rushed for the entire time despite spending a hefty amount on a 3 course meal and 2 bottles of wine within an hour and a half. The real insult came at the end when my stepfather paid the bill who is English where the 20% tip doesn't exist and keeping in mind it was the first night he was out dining here in the U.S. He gave a 10% tip at first but my brother, mother and I who have all worked in the service industry looked at what he left and we started to pull out wallets out to pay the rest- without hesitation and immediately. Before we had even stood up from the table the owner/manager came up to us again and abruptly asked us if we had a problem. We said that we didn't but he followed up by saying that we had only tipped 10% and then walked away.... We were still sitting down and he proceeded to shout in French and then pointed us out to all of the staff working there, literally pointed. We had put the extra tip on the table before he walked away but he didn't even take the time to look.... \n\nWithin the hour and a half of being there we were accused of lying and shamed before we even had the chance to make up for a simple mistake. We did not feel welcome. We have worked in the service industry (my brother still does) and know how to treat other people. I joined yelp again just to write this review- my only negative! \n\nWe definitely do not expect a red carpet to be rolled out in our honor but a little hospitality would go a long way!

Prominent Hayes Valley location, lots of cool shopping and restaurants nearby.  Street parking was not too bad within a few blocks, but it could have been luck.

The hostess was very friendly and helpful.  I was able to have a beer while waiting outside.\n\nIt's a solid French menu.  We started out with a couple of salads, the organic greens salad with sherry vinaigrette and pears, and the frisee salad with a poached egg and red wine vinaigrette, and both were okay.  The Acme baguette for the table was good.  For entrees, we had the flat iron steak with French fries, the pork chop with brussel sprouts and bacon, and the fettucini carbonara.  They were all okay.  The steak was requested to be medium rare, but came medium well.  The pork chop was a bit dry and the brussel sprouts undercooked.

I was able to snag a few bites of the truffled mac n' cheese, which was so good it was hard to stop at just a few bites.  The crepe was delicious and its portion size was just right, especially before a performance.

Major props to Dave, our server! We told him we were in a rush and had to make a 6:30 concert (for which we were planning to leave the restaurant at 6:15 to walk over and find our seats). We luckily already knew what we wanted to order and within less than 10 minutes, we had our food! He checked on us multiple times to make sure the food was good and that we were doing ok with time, then got us out ASAP so we could get the the concert. Thanks, Dave, for the great service!!\n\nNow onto the food. After reading previous yelp reviews, we had decided to order les moules (mussels), french fries, and the pork chops:\n\nLes Moules (Mariniere - with garlic, white wine, lemon juice, and parsley) - the mussels came heaping out of the black bowl/bucket. They were perfectly cooked and the sauce. Oh, the sauce. it was soo good - we kept dipping the bread into the sauce in order to drink up as much of it as we possibly could.\n\nFrench Fries - yes, we ordered french fries at a French restaurant (and yes, french fries are not French), but these were so PERFECT. Nice and crispy on the outside, but soft and pillowy on the inside. Perfectly salted and garnished with a bit of parsley. Let me tell you, though: the star of the fries, nay, the MEAL, was the garlic aioli that came with the fries. We loved this so much we had to ask for a second dipping bowl of the aioli. Just think creamy, garlicky perfection....ughh I'm drooling just thinking about this.\n\nPork Cop (with brussel sprouts and apple cider mustard sauce) - my first bite was perfect! Nice and crisp (like a good sear) on the outside, and totally tasty. My only thing with this was that the rest of the pork chop was a tiny bit on the dry side. The mustard sauce and brussel sprouts were a good complement to the pork chop, but I do wish the pork chop was just a little more juicy.\n\nI wish we had time to try the desserts because we saw other people's desserts and they looked AMAZING, but, as I mentioned at the beginning, we were in a rush. I will definitely be coming back for another visit!!", "author": "Charissa L."}

Upon asking if there is a problem with the order, or if something is wrong, he dismissed my question, sniggered and scoffed, and continued to ask me \"which one\" ( the menu doesn't mention any options within that order, and I've always got a standard carrot& zuchini- so I was perturbed at first with his question, instead of explaining, he got more & more wound up) . His tone was extremely condescending and judgmental. I asked him once more, very nicely, and he walked away. I felt extremely uncomfortable sitting in a restaurant being judged for the food I ordered- and given no explanation whatsoever. I tried talking it out with him again but he was dismissive, rude and arrogant. I let him know I live in the neighborhood and dined here several times before with fairly decent service (hat tip to Ari for their impeccable service the last time) and had never before been given this treatment. Can we talk it out? \" I don't need to talk with you, you don't get to judge me, I don't care if you're uncomfortable- I am the owner here\". That was it, I left of my own accord. Apparently you get to insult your customers, roll your eyes at them, not care for their comfort and give no hoots about their *polite* feedback- and yet expect not get called out.

Very beautiful gal.  \n\nWe started with the baked camembert with roasted garlic.  Holy goodness this was yummy.  However, ask for more bread.  You will want every little bit you can scrape.  The garlic was sweet and not over powering at all.  I thought I would have garlic breath, but I didnt.  The cheese is hot, so be careful.  However, creamy and delish worked wonderful with the sweet roasted garlic and the saltiness from the cheese.  We killed this dish.\n\nThen to the mussels.  oh theses little shellfish that carry the wonderful liquor that it is cooked in.  Tried the Thai flavor with lemon grass, garlic, cilantro, coconut milk and chili.  It had a kick, but nothing that would make me say spicy.  Fresh mussels and the broth was good.  Meh in my book.  I will try something else next time, \n\nFrench fries with aoili that came with the mussels were meh.  Nothing too exciting about them.  They did come out hot and not greasy which is a plus.\n\nLamb and Veggie brochettes (which means KABOB) with couscous and pesto minto coulis.  This was what killed the restaurant for me.  A) no clue it was kabob style.  I am sure the word Brochettes means kabob... but the lamb was flavorless.  The veggies were bitter.  The couscous was dry.  Nothing on this plate worked at all.  It was beyond a disappointment.  I really wished I would have had the croque madame like I wanted initially.  Well I wish I would have filled up on bread instead of trying this lamb.  \n\nDon't come here if you are on a time crunch.  We arrived at 5:45 and did not get our main (yucky lamb) dish until 7:05.  Maybe it was a good thing that it was horrible since we finished the plate in 5 minutes and then asked for the check.  Not sure why it would take so long in between the mussels and the lamb, but we waited 20 minutes for it to come.  I was watching the clock since our show started at 7:30.  \n\nOverall... would I come back... ehhh.. too many other places to try in the area.  Everything was great until that lamb dish.  I swear that is what is giving this review barely a 2 star rating.", "author": "Princess D."}

At first we were a little annoyed because we put down our name around 4pm yet two hours later they still hadn't called us yet for our table. When we finally just went to the restaurant (we were nearby getting drinks) they apparently made noises about how they couldn't accommodate us. Their biggest table was only a 6 seater. So it was kind of annoying that they hadn't told us earlier. But then about 15-20 minutes later we were seated at the 6 person table. Don't ask me how, since I didn't take part in discussions with the manager - but I'm assuming one or a couple girls in our group complained loudly enough lol and trust me, since we're third year law students we have no problems with arguing with people hahaha\n\nThe six person table fit us fine since we're all petite girls. We ordered right away as we had been looking at the menu outside. We needed to eat quickly because we were watching Chicago at 8 at the Orpheum Theater.\n\nI had the mussels mariniere with pomme frites and the beef tartare. Both dishes were as great as any that I've had at other restaurants. I also got to try other girls' truffle mac and cheese and that was also delicious. But buyer beware - the truffle in that mac and cheese is strong. One of the girls didn't like it because she said the truffle was overpowering. I like truffle so I thought it was the yums haha oh and their pomme frites? They were def on point!\n\nSo food was top of the line - didn't blow me out of the water but really solid. However, they get five stars for their excellent service. Topped off our waters consistently and best part? They were constantly bringing out new bowls to hold our mussel shells. After the third or fourth time they did that, I knew I was going to give them 5 stars as I've never had another place switch out the bowls like that and I've always struggled with where to put the shells haha \n\nSo there you have it - solid food, awesome and attentive service, oh and the food came out so fast!

I don't think any other restaurant's French onion soup can compare.  The soup was hot in temperature.  The size of the bread floating on the broth was large and not small, leaf-sized pieces.  Cheese blanketed the entire top of the bowl, not mere slivers sprinkled on top.  The broth was flavorful.  The onions were generous.  \n\nThe Poulette mussels were swimming in a delicious broth of white wine and cream with shallots, bacon, and parsley sprinkled on top.  The size and texture of the mussels were typical, nothing extraordinary.  Thus, I think the selling point of the mussels here is simply the variety of broth flavors that they can be served in.\n\nBut, again, my favorite aspect of this restaurant is its French onion soup.  Hands down.  Oh so good.\n\n(The restaurant is also walking distance to the SF War Memorial and Performing Arts Center.)", "author": "Yolanda V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-19", "description": "I'm back from a 3 year Yelping hiatus to review Chez Maman, that's how great they are.\n\nIt was a Tuesday night and my gal and I were starving. We'd had the brunch here before and were wanting to try the dinner menu, so we stopped on by. There was a list (not too long) and the hostess took my name and my phone number and let us know she'd call us when our table was ready. Cool. We decided to go across the street to Absinthe for a cocktail while we waited.\n\nSo we're sipping our cocktails in Absinthe and get a call about 20 minutes later, letting us know that our table was ready. Sweet. We finish our cocktails and head across the street.\n\nNow, here's where it gets a little weird. Apparently our table wasn't actually ready, but a two top had been given their check and were presumed to be leaving shortly. As soon as they left, the table was ours.\n\nI can understand the logic of this policy of calling folks when a check is delivered, to give them time to finish up whatever they are doing and get to the restaurant. I mean, it shouldn't take THAT long to pay a check and leave, right?\n\nRight? (Can you guess where this is going?)\n\nSo we waited. We waited. And waited. AND WAITED. By this time I was seriously starving, and the Vesper Martini from Absinthe was starting to wear off. Major hangriness (that's hungry + angry) happening. But what are you going to do?\n\nThe hostess was extremely apologetic about the wait, and when we finally did get a seat (who knows if it was even the original table we were meant for, or if those folks are still sitting with the check on their table to this day) I mentioned with a bit of pointed irritation that they might want to revisit the timing of their calls for their waitlist (though in my defense I had not reached total hunger breakdown assholeness, and made sure to let the hostess know that I knew this wasn't her fault).\n\nAnyway, we sit down and the waiter is with us immediately, telling us that the hostess let him know about our frustrating wait and could he get us an appetizer on the house to start?\n\nSure, great, thank you! The perfect response from the staff in that situation. We'd been looking at the escargot on the menu so decided to try that, along with two glasses of wine. He rushed back to put the order in, and then a few minutes later the bus boy came out with a salad. \"Oh, we didn't order a salad,\" but the bus boy said \"no, the waiter told me to bring this to you.\" MORE free food? Awesome! The salad had fried cheese on top of it, so duh, it was delicious.\n\nOur waiter came back out to take our entree order and we thanked him for the salad. \"I figured you guys must be starving, and the escargot takes a while to prepare, so I wanted to get you some food as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWe were totally floored by this! We thanked him in earnest again, and both ordered the Flat Iron Steak. Me with the fries, my gal subbed in the garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe rest of the meal was a dream. The escargot was fantastic, smothered in garlic and butter and pesto I think. Delicious. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection--everything was just perfect (maybe this was because we were starving, but hey).\n\nWe also had a chocolate mousse for dessert, and when the check came, we saw we'd only been charged for the two steaks and the two glasses of wine! Fantastic!\n\nWe paid our check quickly (cough cough, let that be a lesson for you, check dawdling table!) and of course I left a grateful tip and thanked our waiter for going above and beyond to make a frustrating situation right for us (and more right than we probably deserved!).\n\nSo while the food at Chez Maman is definitely superb, the service and care we got that night were second to none. We'll definitely be back, and I've been spreading the word about how awesome this place is since.\n\nGreat job!", "author": "Kevin H."}

Luckily, this past weekend, the bf and I scored a table outside on a warm Friday night.\n\nThe food was really good and the service was extremely friendly and attentive.  The restaurant has a lovely small French cafe feel, although they also serve Mexican food from their sister restaurant Papito.  So if you want French food and your friend wants Mexican...Chez Maman will be perfect.\n\n\nMy bf and I decided we both wanted French so we ordered:\n\n - French onion soup ($6) - definitely one of the better French onion soups I've tried\n - Organic greens salad ($6.50) - a basic greens salad, good, but nothing special\n - Les moules mariniere with garlic, white wine, lemon & parsley ($15) - hands down the best mussels I've ever had; the sauce was perfection\n - Lamb and veggie brochettes (kabobs) with couscous and pesto-mint sauce ($21) - the lamb was extremely tender and the whole dish had amazing flavor\n - Sauteed vegetables on the side ($5) - these were okay, a little underdone\n - Nutella and banana crepe ($7) - delicious, of course\n\n\nAccompanied with a glass of rose and a glass of moscato with dessert, the total bill came out to $82 for two, which is great for the quality of food.  The must-orders are definitely the mussels and the lamb dish!

My only complaint was that the croutons were soggy upon delivery.  \n\nHamburger (3/5):  I was quite disappointed, especially with all the reviews.  But I'm a burger fan and I have high expectations.  The bun was huge and the little hamburger that lay inside was swallowed up by the bun.  You had to each through the bun before getting to the meat. The beef was just OK, not juicy (I ordered medium), and not very flavorful.  In addition, I like pickles on my burger and the only pickles they had were these little pickle-wannabees. \n\nPork Chop (4/5):  Excellent pork chop, but not as good as Nopa.

I always disliked its neighbor, Absinthe, because it did not feel like real French food. Confirmed my theory with the bartender, who lived in Paris and before that Auxerre, which is near my other home in Bourgogne. I like simple French food. Like French Onion soup or moules. Went for a cup of soup and a glass of Bordeaux, simple and good, a perfect way to end an evening from City Arts and Lectures, of which I'm a season ticket holder, and as the days get shorter and nights longer, after the show, I just want to find something warm, and homey. Chez Maman did that for me, I've been here several times now and I do like it. I think the problem with good French food is that people think that it needs to be fancy and expensive but it should not have to be, a good meal I had in France is often very simple, hearty, and it should leave you feeling fulfilled yet not stuffed. I tend to find good food in my travels, and when I return home San Francisco I try to find them so that my memories could be evoked and I could relive my life abroad. As I get older I tend to enjoy barstool seating. I like the way the restaurant is laid out, very intimate and it really does remind me small bistros in Paris. I would come back here in a heart beat. I think this place and Garcon are the two I like the most in the city. The French alley is good in Financial distribute but way too touristy. I've eaten lots of French meals.

Casual brasserie-yet-excellent food, great staff, very nice wine and cider selection. \n\nAs you've read in other reviews, the moules are the way to go. The moules mariniere are delicious, and be ready to order extra bread to dip into the broth at the bottom. Add a bottle of wine or cider, and you are set. The steak frites were top-notch as well... We are picky, but are always very pleased. My fris\u00e9e salad was good also... Not sure you can go wrong here. We have liked the Croque Madame as well. \n\nGreat food, lovely staff, outdoor or bar seating... I think it's appropriate for a brunch, a date, just fun with friends... you'll love it.

They don't take reservations, so if you go on a popular night, your going to have to put your name on the list.\n\nI tried the BAKED CAMEMBERT with roasted garlic and toast points appetizer ($8), which was a yummy warm cheese with lots of garlic in it, that comes in a small ramekin and you spread on butter-garlic toast. It also came with a head of roasted garlic, which was messy to get out, but creamy and delicious also spread on bread. The small salad on the side was also good; fresh greens with nice vinaigrette dressing. Cheese is pretty filling, so I would recommend sharing this as an appetizer.\n\nThe STRIPED BASS garlic spinach & mango cucumber sauce ($19) was very good; I would definitely get it again. The mango cucumber was more of a salsa than a sauce; it was a diced mix around the plate. The dish tasted fresh and light; like a summer dish.\n\nIn general, the place is fairly small. There are two four-person tables outside, but the sidewalk seems a little on the small side to support it, and seems like of close to the road. There are also some seats at the counter. The tables are kind of close together, especially for the two-person tables, there isn't a lot of privacy; save the really dirty talk for later. ;)  I would classify it as \"upscale casual\". They are definitely trying to be classier than the usual diner, and are charging more also, but the food we had was also of a nicer sort than the usual, and tasted really good. My impression was that they use high quality ingredients and cook it well. On the other hand, they also have a burger on the menu, offer seating at the bar, and the menus are laminated sheets on the table.", "author": "Holly B."}

I would have liked to know while I was there; I would have been more patient. I have to say, I am impressed and pleased, and am changing my original review. We will be going back.\n\nMy friend really wanted to take a group of us there last night. We went and waited an hour, which didn't really bother us as there were six of us and the place is small. There is a beautiful little tiny park on Linden Lane a block away where we sat while we waited. They called our phone when they were ready for us! That was really convenient. We sat for a very long time until the waiter came to see if we wanted drinks. We had a very patient teenager and an older gentleman with us who were hungry and we were trying to be patient and enjoy the dining experience. It took a very long time for us to get our drinks, and a very long time to then get the appetizers. The appetizers were fantastic. We had french onion soup and mussels. I didn't try the escargot, though my future sister in law said it was fantastic. After the waiting for everything else, I was astounded at how long it took to get our main courses served. We waited at least 45 minutes from the time we finished the appetizers until the waiter brought our food. He never cleaned the table, so we sat, cramped, at a tiny table with six people with dishes covering the entire surface area the majority of the time we were there. We had to practically trip him to get more water, more napkins, etc. Three times they tried to bring us food we didn't order. They finally got all of our correct dishes on the table and I noticed that my endive salad was mostly endive, and not cheese and pecans. They were all in my sister in law's bowl. They must have mixed it all in one big dish but I thought they should have made sure the salad was evenly distributed. I didn't want to be a butt so I didn't say anything about the salad to her. She had all the pecans and cheese and yumminess in her bowl. :/ The main courses were mediocre and the choices were few. My sil said the crepe was  overcooked but the inside was good. The whole experience would have been ok if the waiter had paid attention to our table instead of sauntering around. I lived in SF for ten years and was used to restaurants trying to compete with each other with good service and great food.

No wait on Valentines 2013 for an unplanned dinner for 2 at 9pm. While everyone's running around trying to find some fancy restaurant to impress, I'd like to think I got the win with Chez Maman.\n\nWhen you first look at the menu, don't miss the mexican food on the right side of the menu. Yes, you heard me --- MEXICAN food at a French restaurant (WHATT???!!)! But don't be scared to try it if you are craving quesadillas, because the quesadilla was damn good! But more on that later.\n\nMust have had a big appetite that night so to the food ordered:\n\n- L' oriental crepe with merguez, caramelized onions, swiss cheese & egg (over - easy). \nThis crepe was no joke. The swiss cheese, merguez and egg were perfectly complimented with spicy arugula on top. This was probably the best combination I've ever had and it goes without saying, I was a very happy girl.\n\n- Veal with creamy white wine sauce & mushrooms.\nWHOA - the white wine sauce is YUMMMMMMM!! I just wouldn't have been able to eat the whole entree by myself as it would probably be too overwhelmingly rich for one person. Even the veggies that came with it seemed like it was cooked with butter.\n\n- Pollo Empanizado - fried chicken quesadilla, chipotle remoulade, salsa roja, \nguacamole & purple cabbage slaw\nThis was a ridiculously large serving. No joke. I was expecting the fried chicken to be the standard whole pieces of fried chicken, but instead, the chicken was chopped into little pieces inside the quesadilla. You'd think this defeats the purpose of the chicken, but actually it's quite genius as the chicken become little pieces of fried goodness all over the dish.\n\nI haven't been so happy with a restaurant in a longggg time. Food was solid, prices were REALLY good for a French restaurant in SF (or anywhere else for that matter). Plus the venue is really cute for a date as it's small and intimately lighted at night.

With the success of the French Onion Soup at the original Chez Maman, West was launched. The space here is larger, and much more accommodating to groups of diners. \n\nThe wait for a table was alleviated with bottles of wine we brought ourselves. Corkage is $20/bottle with a max of two. Corkage can be confusing at times, because I've been to places that change a one time corkage and others charge the fee per bottle. Due to the confusion, they comped the second bottle fee. Excellent customer service!\n\nThe menu, along with the French options, includes the awkward addition of Mexican entrees like tacos/quesadillas/burritos. Without trying to deviate from the reason we came in the first place, I ordered an onion soup and the burger. While I appreciate being able to order onion soup any day of the week, as opposed to just weekends at the original location, I do have to say the original tastes better. Multiple soups were still enjoyed this time around, just less satisfying. \n\nThe burger was a bare bones burger and had options for toppings at $1.50 each. It's one of those that starts off under $10 with the potential to reach $25 all toppings considered. On this occasion the brie and egg sufficed to make a delicious pairing.  \n__\nJuly '12 Health Score - 94", "author": "Dennis L."}

So wrong of me.  While there was a hiccup or two, I really like this place, I would most certainly return, and I recommend it.\n\nThere, readers with short attention spans can leave now.\n\nWhat pisses me off is, why couldn't I find a restaurant like this in Paris?  A month in Europe and none of our meals were this good.  I blame myself, but honestly, how hard does one have to look, over there?\n\nWe had the Moules Mariniere (fantastic, better than Chow, as good as Grand Cafe), Merquez Sausage (very nice, spicy) and pasta carbonara (one of the better ones I've tasted), and fries.  My fries were bottom of the bag and not much more appealing than the conical holder they came in, and the first batch came out cold.  That was fixed immediately, with almost no delay.  The Crepe Suzette was a nice crepe in too much brandy, so it tasted like orange flavored brandy over a crepe.  The owner/manager (?) made a cursory attempt to light the brandy, which failed, and he gave up with no further effort, which was not impressive.  Either get the lighting technique down, or change the recipe, don't make one attempt and then walk off.   In any case, I would not recommend the crepe suzette as it's not the best example out there, not bad, but not what it could be.\n\nThe menu also listed burgers and mac-n-cheese, and oddly enough, under the heading of BISTROT:  Mexican food.   Mexican food in a French restaurant?  Well why not, the kitchen crew seems to come from Central America, not the South of France, but still...\n\nA young couple came in and sat next to us.  I heard her ask \"What are moules\", I pointed to my shells and added that they were very good.  She had the mac-n-cheese, so you see there are silly people who can't go anywhere without ordering kids food.  Hell, I heard a young American girl atop Notre Dame exclaim \"Oh look!  There's a Subway!  I love Subway!\".   Were it not for the safety cage, I might have tossed her over the side!\n\nSo yes, I liked this place, and look forward to going back.

At four o'clock one afternoon last week, tried again for a late lunch/early dinner and this time, were seated right away.  I ordered the Nicoise salad with ahi tuna and my husband the salmon burger.  Both were quite mediocre-- the salad featuring tasteless hot house tomatoes, and completely raw, cold tuna, as though it had barely touched a grill hours earlier, then refrigerated and put on top of the salad that had also sat in a refrigerator.

We were just cruising by and noticed that little restaurant at one of the corners. Quick reviews check on Yelp and we were in. It was the Thanksgiving evening so there weren't many people inside. I wasn't really hungry so I just got an appetizer - lamb sausages. They were absolutely delicious. On top of that price is extremely reasonable, I think it was only like $8 or something. I can see this dish served in Vegas or Hollywood for $15 easily. My wife got a salad and pasta and she said that they both were excellent.\n\nBut anyway, I was so surprised by the outstanding quality of the food that I made an exception and I went there again (next day) during the same trip :) This time I came prepared - read hungry. I ordered the french onion soup ($6) and the Chez Mamam basic burger (with addition on bacon and swiss) ($11 + $3 for addons). I'm deliberately listing the prices to show the outstanding value you're getting there. Both dished were stunning. I could eat the soup everyday, perfect flavor, perfect temperature, perfect size. The sandwich was one of the best burgers I've ever had (and it's a French Bistro!). The bun was a french roll, super fresh and light. It was served with really good fries and salad. It was so good that I wish I could go there tonight :( \n\nThey also have a nice selection of wines, but for me, as a beer person that is the only issue: beer selection is pretty poor, they have Modelo & Heineken. Three other beers on tap, one of them being french. I wish they would serve 3-4 craft beer, if not from Europe, at least local. That would make this little joint a 6 star restaurant :)\n\nOur server (same guy on both nights, unfortunately I don't know the name) was great, very attentive and polite. No problems at all. Oh, I actually went to the \"main location\" but I was surprised to find out that over there they only have one table and some bar seating, so we went back to the West branch.\n\nThis was one of the highlights of our SF visit for sure.

And I have burgers & fries. \n\nI've been to Chez Maman in Potrero Hill once and remember the visit fondly: small space, great service, delicious food. \n\nIt seems like the team has used the exact same formula to recreate their Hayes Valley location.\n\nOccupying the busy corner of Hayes & Gough where Terra Cafe & Bakery used to be located, Chez Maman had a soft opening today. It just so happened to be the same day I had plans with a friend who let me convince him to check this place out.\n\nLet it be known: the restaurant is small. With a total of maybe 10 tables and an L-shaped bar, it's going to fill up fast. We got there and wrote our name on a white board out front. We waited no more than 5 minutes before being sat. The plus of a small space on a corner restaurant is there's lots of natural light from all angles and you get to know(/eavesdrop on) your neighbors well.\n\nWe started with wine and the Provencale mussels (tomato concassee, basil, garlic & bell pepper). The sauce and peppers were perfect. Save all your bread for the mussels.\n\nMy buddy got the fish sandwich and I got a burger with a fried egg on it. Both come on a toasted roll, grilled onions and a side of fries. I was surprised how well the egg held up. I didn't have a plate of egg fries. But now that I think about it, I should open a restaurant that sells only that. \n\nNow let's get to business. I'm pretty serious about fries and these were delicious. A little bigger than In-N-Out, but small enough to remain in the thinner fry category. \n\nThe burger was large, meaty and hard to fit in my mouth (that's what he/she said). But it was cooked just how I like and I scarfed the entire thing up. \n\nOverall, very impressed that this was the first day. \n\nFriendly service, good food and a great location made for a perfect end to my quasi-drizzly Monday evening. \n\n_______\nPS: They've added a Mexican component to the menu but I wasn't brave enough to try it.

My partner and I were really craving good burgers and we read good reviews for this place. I got the burger with avocado and goat cheese (cooked medium) and my partner got a burger with avocado and bacon (cooked medium-rare, which was what the waiter suggested). We also got the mixed green salad with pears. \n\nThe greens salad with pear was okay. My partner liked it more than I did. Very basic, very simply, very little flavor.\n\nThe burgers were \"fine\", meaning they were \"good enough.\"  We both felt the need to put a lot of salt on the burgers to get any flavor.  Also, a major pet peeve of mine... the burger was smaller than the bun.  The goat cheese was a mistake (I thought it might be, but I wanted to take a chance) and the bacon was pretty much all fat.\n\nAt the end of the meal we agreed that the meal was \"3 stars\" - \"Meh, it's okay.\"  HOWEVER, my partner woke up at 4:30 AM projectile vomiting, which continued for nearly 4 hours. He was sick until about 5:30 PM with nausea and classic food poisoning symptoms.  I was also quite nauseous, but not to the same extent. I ate less and my burger was cooked a bit more, so that's what we're attributing the difference in sickness to.  We emailed the restaurant this morning to inform them that the beef was bad, but we didn't hear back.  I called this evening and spoke with someone who said the manager wasn't available. There was no offer to comp the meal and he challenged whether the food poisoning was indeed due to the meal I ate there.  That was disappointing.

There is a white board hanging but you don't write your name, they do it so you have to snag someone and that can take a while, so if you want to make sure you get on the list promptly, go inside and get someone's attention.\n\nAtmosphere: very small place, maybe ten tables mostly two tops. Not a place to bring even a group of six, at least not in prime time. It is also very congested and crowded, just like French restaurants. You have to move the table to get into the banquet seating. Three tables are outside overlooking Hayes. You just wait outside until your name is called. There were five people ahead of us and it took maybe twenty minutes. They do get people in and put relatively quickly.\n\nService: service is efficient but not particularly friendly. We were kind of waved to seats and very quickly the server was asking if we wanted coffee and back to take our orders. This place moves. Food is bought quickly and cleared quickly with multiple people working to get your food to you, your table cleared your water filled.\n\nFood: we ordered a Savoyard crepe and the croque Madame and both were quite good with the Madame winning out for flavor and less cheese. The savoyard is served win what I think  was a buckwheat crepe with tiny, tiny cubes of fingerling potato (need more of these) and almost in visible pieces of cornichons (needs way more of these to cut through the very rich cheese). The cheese is raclac (sp.) I think and there is prosciutto slices. It's served with a lightly dressed pile of greens on top. The croque is a medium sized sandwich with shaved ham, draped in gruyere cheese with a sunny side up egg on top. I do not think there is any sauce on the sandwich. It's flavor is a mixture of the salty ham and salty gruyere, a very good gruyere. And it comes with large pile of lightly dressed arugula. \n\nDrinks: they have about ten wines by the glass, half of them French it seemed. We had a white pouilly fuisse and a red cotes de Rhone. Both were good, simple rustic wines that went well with the food. They are served in small wine glasses, almost filled to the top.\n\nThe overall atmosphere and experience of this place is a bustling, friendly but efficient French lunch.", "author": "Vivek V."}

While ordering, the server was super helpful in the decision-making process. I asked him if it was lame for me to get the Papito Super Burrito given everything else on the menu, and he said absolutely not, so I went with it, and it's a decision I'll never regret.\n\n*Chez Maman Mac & Cheese-- 5 stars\n(with shaved truffles, truffle oil, gruyere cheese)\nIt's hard to get Mac & Cheese right, as easy as making it may seem. I've had so much bad Mac & Cheese that I now tend to refrain from ordering it, but the table wanted it and it was recommended on Yelp, so we went with it, and it was perfect! \n\n*Super Burrito-- 10 stars!!\n(with spanish rice, black beans, pico de gallo, monterey jack cheese, guacamole & cr\u00e9me fraiche)\nI would venture to say this is the best burrito I've ever eaten in the city of San Francisco. I was a bit nervous about ordering of all things, a burrito, at this sort of upscale french place with a very french menu, but had heard that Papito's, Chez Maman's mexican food branch, was really good and was craving a burrito. It ended up being the BEST CHOICE EVER! This $8 entree choice at a ~$15 average entree price place is also great for the slightly more cost-cosncious friend of the group too (me). The burrito came with chips and some kind of red sauce (which i didn't like too much), had a TON of flavor, was quite lime-y (so if you don't like lime-y burritos, i don't recommend), and very filling.\n\n*French Fries with Aioli-- 2.5 stars\nThe aioli was good, the fires were nothing special. I don't recommend getting this so that you have space in your stomach for the actual dishes. Wouldn't get it next time.\n\nOther things my non-vegetarian friends got that I didn't try, but heard about:\n*Les Moules-- Poulette with shallots, bacon, white wine, cream & parsley\n*Chez Maman Basic Burger\nGiven that I didn't try these things, i don't have much to say, except that all of my friends raved about how good the bread tasted when they dipped it in the Mussel sauce. Dip for long enough that the bread soaks the sauce in. Try it!\n\nSummary of things I love about this place:\n1. They call you when your table is ready\n2. Free bread!\n3.

It's a tiny place with limited seating, so it seems there's always a wait. For a Thursday, it wasn't too bad - they sat us at the bar. There's beer and wine selection is average; I started with a glass of Malbec, my friend with a Belgian beer I like. Having worked in fine dining, I was a little disappointed to note that my wine was definitely old/had gone bad. I feel that not many people know the smell of spoilt wine, so I just didn't drink it and had a beer instead. Just FYI, if the red wine smells like an old, musty library of books, then it has gone bad. We had the beef tartare with the quail egg on top. It was good, but the dressing oddly reminded me of macaroni salad (too sweet) which I didn't really like as a flavor. I had the burger with brie, caramelized onions and mushrooms. I asked for medium rare and got medium well (too dry for me), also disappointing, though the flavors were good. The fries were nicely seasoned and crispy and the side salad was light and refreshing. We also got the salmon fillet with roast vegetables. The portion looked like one bite compared to my burger. My friend ended up helping me because he wasn't full from his plate. The bartender/serve was pleasant and the ambiance was nice and cozy. A number of inconsistencies and hiccups stopped our experience from being amazing, but it was still nice and I'm sure if those things are addressed (maybe they are better when they aren't so busy/stressed? though that shouldn't really be an excuse)....it will be oh so delicious and wonderful.

Stopped into Chez Maman West tonight... one day after their official soft open, and I'm already thinking about what to order next time! \n\nThe energy in the restaurant was great; it was packed but we managed to score a couple of spots at the bar... Which put us super close to the great wine selection and attentive bartender, plus it afforded great views of the street for people watching! \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the shrimp ceviche and grilled corn, which were incredibly flavorful and simply fantastic. As main courses we had the Veggie Monsieur sandwich and the Mussels Mariniere with frites, of course. The Veggie Monsieur was decadent and delicious, and the sauce that the mussels were served in was so good I ordered an extra basket of bread to sop it up with.\n\nCompletely sumptuous meal with great energy and service.

The two gentlemen next to me on the copper counter ordered soon after, and we were collectively oohing and aahing over our respective dishes.  I stuck with a traditional Nicoise salad, yummy.  The young man from Chicago who was visiting San Francisco for the first time ordered a haumburger on a sourdough roll, with cheese and bacon. and shoestring fries. Something you might imagine getting in New Orleans. He took a picture and I hope he posted elsewhere here on Yelp/ He said he spotted someone else wolfing it down outside on the sidewalk outside the Bistro and had to come in after that sight. I agree, it was wondrous to behold. He left not a crumb. I don't think you would either.

As we ordered, our server informed us that they were out of salmon, which is really half of their menu. First warning. We changed our order, and then waited. And waited. Half an hour later and the food still hasn't arrived. Second warning. Note that we were the first people in the restaurant to place an order.  Well, when the food finally arrived, it was half an hour later. Rather than apologize, the guy simply stated \"the first order is always the hard one, I don't know why.\"  If he would have added an \"I'm sorry\", it would have gone a long way. And of course, everyone else started getting their food right away. \n\nThe food itself was...eh.  Our eggs were overcooked.

We started with the escargot--they were delicious and piping hot. I love how they give you the special French tongs to pick up the snail shells! I had the basic burger with Swiss and avocado for my entree. The burger was so good! My only complaint is that they're a little stingy on the sides. When you pay $1.50 per side, you should get more than a few slices of avocados. That being said, I was still very, very satisfied with my burger. Also at our table were the mariniere mussels, the croque Madame, and the crepe savoyarde. The croque was good and the mussels were outstanding. The crepe was just okay, it tasted much better after pouring garlic aioli and mussel sauce on top. The garlic aioli that accompanies the fries is fantastic and tastes awesome on everything.

A roasted maggot. We were both so disgusted that we could not speak.  I waived the waiter over and pointed at it politely but the response was the most alarming (!!) He justified the situation by saying: \"OF COURSE this happens sometimes! It's organic salad! This is normal! You have to expect this!\"  Almost as if to say WE were crazy.  This definitely left the worst impression.  I have since done my homework and maggots do not eat lettuce plus this was one was roasted so there is still a mystery for me. I actually left a tip. I am not quite sure why but i did. I felt bad for the waiter.\n\nMore surprising though, was the owner's reaction.  The manager informed him as to why he had comped our bill and the owner just walked to the next table without saying a word to us! If i had a business, i would NEVER ever let that go without saying something.\n\nI thought about this long and hard on whether I should write a review or not... but in the end, i depend on other yelpers to give me the truth.. so here is mine.  \n\nPlease note: (To be fair)\n\n1)  When it happened, the manager did ask my client if she wanted a replacement and of course she said no.  He asked me if i was done and I was definitely done.   He took the plates away and we sat perplexed in silence.  The same waiter came back and put the bill on the table and said he waived it.  The truth is that, I could have cared less though, all i wanted to do was run away.  \n\n2) The manager has since contacted me and he did say sorry for his reaction.  Maybe i should have put myself in his shoes as well as the waiter (and manager) whom had to deal with an uncomfortable situation. \n\n2) To reassure you, he also informed me that: \"a janitorial company scrubs my entire restaurant 365 days a year after closing. There is no trash or sewer anywhere near ANY food or prep areas. All the produce comes clean packaged, and goes directly to the walk in fridge, and then to the service area. The greens we serve in the salads come washed and ready to serve, they are from an organic company and unfortunately on a rare occasion they will have a small bug.\"  \n\n3) I have eaten here on numerous occasions and never had problems. \n\nPS: If you are one of those people that wants to exercise your first amendment rights say that these maggots are edible, please refrain from doing so.. because when you do not ORDER these little guys in your plate, it's quite disgusting and shocking.", "author": "Sara S."}

As we walked out, my friend was very angry and the waiter ran after us and accosted us outside. He said there must have been a misunderstanding and explained that they make salary so they don't need the tips. Then why bother asking??? Also we WERE going to leave tips, I was going to leave it on the table before we leave. We had a great time and we enjoyed the food, there is no reason for why we would not leave tips.

When I came for brunch I had the burger and added goat cheese. The burgers start at $11 with all the basics and you can add your own extras to it for $1.50 each. It comes with fries or a salad so the price is normal for a burger of this quality at a non-fast food restaurant. The burger was very good and I like the bun that they used. My wife got one of their crepes, which are all priced around $10, and she really seemed to enjoy it. The bite I had made me want to have more too. You can get both of these items off their dinner menu too.\n\nFor dinner I would highly suggest starting of with their mussels dishes, made in four different ways. We had the Mariniere and it was awesome. The serving is huge and a great deal for $14. I wouldn't suggest attacking these by yourself unless it is your main course or you have a huge appetite. Definitely enough to feed up to four people as a starter. I have also had their warm goat cheese salad and Mac & Cheese. I highly recommend sharing their Mac & Cheese. Gruyere, shaved truffle, truffle oil - delicious.\n\nOverall Chez Maman serves up good food and is priced well. The space is pretty small and get get crowded on weekends, and even weekdays.

The restaurant itself is not very spacey but has a very homey and serene ambiance. At an hour before closing the place was packed, but fortunately we did not have a wait time due to that one two-top table that had just opened up a few minutes upon our arrival. Staff was very attentive during our entire dining experience. We were greeted by a very good-looking white waiter --- irrelevant to my review but he was very good looking. Gay? :[ --- within a few minutes. The menu offered a broat variety of food from tacos and quesdillas to pasta and escargot and burgers. However, the variety was not over whelming due to that there were not too many selections per section. The server was also very helpful in assisting us in the choosing of our courses. \nWe started out with the \"french onion soup,\"  \"escargot de Bourgogne\", and \"beef tartare\". The soup definitely hit the spot on this chilly summer night, and was not overly sweetened like every other onion soups I've had. The only thing I strongly disliked about the soup was the inch-thick layer of Cheese. Apparently, (according to my dinner date), a good amount of people enjoy a ton of cheese in their onion soups. I definitely did not enjoy it and dug it all out. The amount of cheese i dug out was probably equivalent to the cheese on atleast three to four slices of pizza. Gross. However, I will most likely have this soup again, but will definitely request to have only a sprinkle of cheese. \nI did not touch the escargot, but my friend said that it was very good. The beef tartare at  Chez Maman was the first I have ever tried, and it tasted very fresh and had the perfect balance of spices. \nFor main course we split the veal in white cream sauce and the goat cheese with arugula and balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was okay; the goat cheese was surprisingly not overbearingly-strong in taste. The veal however, was amazing. the butter/garlic cream sauce really hit the spot and felt like every bite melted in my mouth. Even the vegetables on the side tasted amazing because it was also slathered in the sauce. The veal was definitely my favorite dish.\nOver all, I was very happy and had a great experience here. Not entirely sure who our server was tonight but the staff displayed strong teamwork/tagteam skills. Every server in the room tended to our table. I definitely want to come back and have the veal again, but most likely when I do return I will instead order the many other items I wanted to try tonight. Thank you, Maman staff!", "author": "Vicky H."}

The wines by the glass are mediocre the full bottle list is more impressive. Two handsome men behind the counter and  a small but cute almost brasserie style to the restaurant makes this place nice to be. Pricing is reasonable especially compared to its neighbors.

This appetizer really hit the spot. The beef tartare is essentially finely chopped raw beef and it comes with a quail egg that you stir with the beef. You get a few pieces of toast and spread the tartare onto the bread. It's a great appetizer and I would definitely order this again.\n-Mussels with fries: The fries are yummy! Although fries are technically not 'French', they are delish! The mussels are quite good and come with bacon and a white sauce that is rich but not too creamy. It's not the healthiest choice but a very popular and yummy dish.\n-Crepe with smoked salmon and spinach: The savory crepes here are made with buckwheat flour like they are in France, but...the crepe I got was a little soggy (could have been crunchier.

Be sure to write your name on the whiteboard because Chez Maman does not ever take reservations. My table got several different dishes. Eggs benedict $12 (any type) is the best thing on the brunch menu. Everything else is good but very ordinary and not worth the price. All burgers here are $11, they come plain and skimpy. The idea is to build your own burger and buy toppings which costs $1.50 each. I am not paying $1.50 for a slice of cheese. The sandwiches such as paninis and croque madame all taste good and come with a small salad, but I keep thinking \"I just spent $10 on a small sandwich...\" You can never get a bad sandwich here, they all have good flavor and are made with a set standard. On the other hand, it will never be extraordinary. I don't think I will ever come back for brunch or lunch, the quality of food doesn't justify the prices they charge.", "author": "Cecile S."}

Ordered two different types and they both tasted like rotting death. 70% were inedible and after complaining about both batches they sent us out a much smaller version of a new batch. As in the batch that hasn't been in the cooler for the last two weeks rotting. We were so lucky to receive a 1/4 order of non rotting mussels that they still charged us for the prior first two batches that we could barely eat.  $55 later after ordering two beers, a side of fries and a cereal bowl full of somewhat decent mussels I feel like I shouldn't have to still go scavenging for something to eat when I get home since  I'm still hungry. This restaurant is riding on their prime location and cheesy French vibe. Poor service and even worst food. Super disappointing that I got totally ripped of even though the server took back the full plates of food that were not even eaten.

What to know about this location:\n\n- Be prepared for a tiny bistro with about 10 tables + bar seating. They do have 3 tables outside (with heat-lamps!) which is so nice for when it's sunny out but I wouldn't recommend it for large groups. \n- They serve both menus from Chez Maman & a limited one from Papito -- perfect if you have a group that can't decide if they want French or Mexican.\n- I can't tell if they have a full liquor license or just wine + beer. They do offer margaritas & Bloody Marys in addition to a wine & beer selection & don't say if they're soju-based, so presume they just do a limited liquor selection.\n- What to order? Moules Frites are always a favorite as is the amazing grass-fed burger -- I've also gotten the lamb kebab which is HUGE and delightful.\n- They don't take reservations, but if you call they will kindly put your name on the board outside & call you a few minutes before your table is ready.\n- And on that note, the staff is friendly & helpful.

I work down the street from Chez Maman and am 9.5 months pregnant. A friend and I put our name in for lunch last Friday with only two parties ahead of us. The host, although I'm sure he's more than a host continually checked in with me to make sure I was ok standing and offered a chair for me to sit while we waited (although appreciated, I was fine to stand). After a bit longer wait than he expected, he came over to tell us the table was taking longer than expected and there were seats a the bar if I was comfortable. When I said yes (I was totally comfortable), he insisted I take the seat that has a support beam close behind the stool, so I could 'lean back if I needed support.\" I have to admit I was sort've floored by the care and concern he took with me. Once seated (and completely content) another server came over to offer us a table seat if we wanted to move from the bar (we were totally fine at the bar). \n\nAnyway -- the point is I felt completely cared for and a priority for the employees at this restaurant. Sometimes being pregnant can feel like another thing people on the bus or servers have to deal with -- like I'm asking for special treatment. This was definitely not the case at Chez Maman - They made me feel wonderful. \n\nThe food was great as well, salmon sandwich and tomato/brie/prosciutto sandwich (shared) were delicious.

Very decadent, so I recommend splitting it with another person!\n\nFettucini was delicious. The sauce was rich and creamy, but didn't feel too heavy. The portion was huge!\n\nBurger- I tried the basic burger with only cheddar added. The burger itself can get REALLY pricey, but if you keep it simple it's great. The meat is perfectly season and really moist. The only thing that I wasn't estatic about was the bread it came on. Felt a bit dry and chewy.\n\nCreme Brule was insanely delcious.

Light and fluffy!\n\nSlid in there for a weekend lunch, so I took a peak at the brunch menu and thought the prices looked pretty good!

The service was very good and the wait staff were friendly. The seating is comfortable enough. The menu is very nice and there are good selections for both carnivores and vegetarians alike. Unfortunately, the food that night was less than satisfactory. The bread they brought was tasteless and kind of dry. The main courses we ordered weren't up to par either. This was very disappointing because we anticipated a really good meal. Since this was a Sunday evening, we might consider going back on a different night and see if we might have better luck with the food. Until then, the best thing to do is reserve judgment, I think, on the food. So for now I'll just say if you want to go and have a nice glass of wine in a cute little spot in Hayes Valley, I would recommend Chez Maman. For a dining experience, however, I couldn't recommend it at the present time.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

They don't accept reservations, so on weekends you need to be ready to wait in long lines if you want to have a meal before going to the symphony, opera, or other civic center events. \nThe food is a hit-or-miss. I love to it muscles. Sometimes this dish is very fresh and made to order, and the dish is sublime. Other times, the muscles taste like they've been generically steamed beforehand, and then re-steamed again with the particular sauce I've ordered, and the dish is a bit gummy.  \nThe French menu is well thought - like an urban street corner petite bistro in France.  As for the execution, see above.\nThe Mexican part of the menu seems like it has been slapped onto the French part. It just doesn't belong. \nTheir brunch is delicious! Though if you wish to eat brunch before a civic center matinee, be prepared for the lines. It sure worth the wait.\nThe service is very friendly.\nParking is very difficult. Either go to the city parking lot near city hall, or pay the inflated prices of the Hayes Valley garages.", "author": "Ayala K."}

Had to ask for check THREE times.  Waitress uninformed about basic information for menu items.  Overall, she seemed entirely disinterested.  For rxample, \"Is the fish fresh and not frozen,\" I asked.  Response, \"I don't know, probably.\"  She begrudgingly found out for me. My lamb kebab was not very tasty and very oily. My friends salmon was just average. Most disappointing were the desserts. the chocolate mousse had no real flavor. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very lumpy. All in all I won't be going back.", "author": "Peter M."}

Chopped romaine, which is scary enough, flavorless dressing...no croutons, no fresh, parm, no fresh pepper and topped with two scary anchovies that looked seriously old.  By far the worst Caesar I have ever had. And it was $10! Shame on the Chez Papa Group.", "author": "D. H."}

The food is inferior - lacking seasoning and salt on most dishes. We had the Mac and cheese with truffle oil - zero flavor. The carbonara pasta - zero flavor. The mussels were ok  - though they don't offer the best version of the dish that Gamine does (Harissa and mergiuez sausage!) and would not reproduce it for us. Even the baked Camembert appetizer was blah.  Overall, this was a sub-par experience that is not worth a repeat visit.", "author": "Jackie J."}

French wine just a bit cheap, I would have preferred a better choice, even in Californian wine that  would have better fit with the Americanized French food.

A go to when you you want good food at a reasonable price in a nice and cleaning setting. Service was perfect. The wine list is just right. Salade ni\u00e7oise and flank steak were excellent. Not noisy at all, so you can have a nice conversation with your date or friends. There is kid friendly food. Portions are large enough so you ask for a doggy bag. We got a table, but sitting at the counter seemed kind of cool too. I'll be back! It's a sure thing.", "author": "Frances G."}

We got seated pretty fast luckily for us a group was taken off the wait list and the hostess said would be couple minutes.  I had the potato, cheese and prosciutto crepe which was good.  I will say the last French dinner crepe I had years ago I cannot find here in SF but maybe one day, it was more crispy and less spongy than a dessert crepe.  I also liked that I never felt rushed even though the place was pretty full.  I am taking one star away not from the service but the place could use some acoustical work.  I had trouble hearing my friend talk due to the noise, I've noticed this problem in many restaurants.  I just don't want to hear my neighbors conversation and have to be talking pretty loud to hear my friend across the table. Also they don't take AMEX and that's the only card I had, so used my bank card which was pretty low since I just paid all my bills off.  Definitely recommend this place though love the variety of food between French, Mexican and American, you can't go wrong.", "author": "Nirea S."}

The quiche was pretty good, but the L' orientale crepe was boring, almost flavorless. Needed a quick bite on a different day, but the wait was too long. Maybe the crepe was just a weak dish.", "author": "Stelio C."}

There were 4 seats at the bar.  I stopped to get cash at their cash machine in the door and my partner walked in to take two of the seats at the bar.  when I walked in less than 2 minutes later, I could see he was having a discussion with the hostess.  She was having some sort of discussion with him because she was saying he couldn't sit down until his party was complete.  He pointed to me as I walked up and asked whether he should stand up and now sit down again as I was now there.  She made some rude comment I could not hear, so I asked her why she was giving us so much attitude.  I explained that I was using THEIR ATM and paying THEM $2.50 to get money out of it and what was the problem with him sitting down before me.  She said \"I'm French I always have attitude.\"  I was shocked.  Rather than apologizing for her being rude to him, she explained that's how I should expect to be treated by her.  So, I asked again, \"I don't understand.  What exactly is the problem and why are you giving us so much attitude.\"  She again said, \"I'm French.  This is the way I am.  Of course, I have attitude.\"  Again, completely floored that a hostess at a restaurant would instead of wanting to welcome a paying customer would tell that customer to expect to be treated rudely.  She then came around the bar and started to get in our face to again try to be rude.  We got up and left.  Never again.  Don't go here.", "author": "Edward D."}

Fortunately, there isn't a wait to sit outside where they have three tables all with heated lamps above, but of course if it's freezing outside the heated lamps won't be sufficient. On my first visit I sat outside with my friend; we ordered their Cotes du Rhone wine which was very good and reasonably priced as well, we shared the baked camembert with roasted garlic and toast points for an appetizer- the cheese and garlic were great, but I didn't love the toasted points so I ate the baguette they serve instead. For an entree I ordered theNicoise salad which is my favorites salad -ever- and I've had some pretty great versions, but this wasn't one of my favorites. I thought it tasted like it had a bit of mayonnaise and I hate mayonnaise, I also found it to be a bit too salty. Despite my lackluster salad I would definitely visit again because the wine, the appetizer and the service were great, I'll just order something different next time.", "author": "Natalie M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-02", "description": "I used to love going to Chez Maman in Potrero Hill although I didn't get over there frequently. But I remember a small place with a simple menu. The burgers and fries were delicious. So I was very excited to try the new location in my 'hood. I was disappointed however. On my first visit I had the nicoise which I thought was disappointing. While I love canned tuna at home, i don't really enjoy paying for it at a restaurant. I prefer a nicoise with fresh seared tuna. The salad was also overdressed so it was somewhat wilted. It's amazing what just a bit too much dressing will do to your salad. I did enjoy the mussels very much and the wine selection is good. Their fries are also good. But the rest of the menu is just a mess. It's all over the place. What's with the Mexican food? Why not stick to a nice modest selection of typical French food and focus on making those dishes well. I plan to go back to try the crepes which I've heard are good. But I don't know if this will be a regular spot for me. I just wasn't that impressed. I'm hoping this place will shift their focus and do what they do best.", "author": "melanie k."}

Parsley was mixed into the burger meat which is too strong for a burger as it overpowered the meat flavor (it would be fine if it were a meatball sandwich).  The bun was a thick artisan bread and once toasted it was an effort to bite through it.  Kronenbourg1664 on tap is a big plus.", "author": "Bali D."}

Waited ten minutes before waiter came to our table.  He asked if we were ready to order and had to tell him we hadn't received the brunch menu yet.  Finally, got some water while looking over menu.  Eventually a bread basket was dropped onto the center of the table, rather than placed.  Coffee never got refilled since waiter asked after we had finished.  It's really too bad that the service was poor, because the food was quite good.", "author": "Jason R."}
