{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-14", "description": "A and I recently came for dinner at Cocotte after having not dined there for 2 years and the food was just as good as remembered. We made a reservation for late on Saturday night with an hour of lead time. We arrived 10 minutes early and were sat at a high top in the bar area. Cocotte is not a big restaurant at all so the bar area and the dining room are pretty much one in the same. However, we were not given menus for 10 minutes and it became very clear that our server was actually the bartender who had to come out from behind the bar to take our order and check on us. This resulted in a lot of delays both in actually getting menus, placing our order and getting the bill. It wasn't a big deal since we weren't in a rush and did eventually get service but my suggestion to the restaurant is to actually have a waiter (not the bartender) assigned to that table.\n\nI got a very nice glass of Bordeaux and A had a great beer that he hadn't tried from Headlands Brewing. Definitely a small, but mighty, alcohol selection. Having been here before and remembering how good the food was, we both got exactly what we ordered the previous time. A got the Beef Wellington which was delicious, if not a smaller portion. He wasn't full when he was done but since you can never find Beef Wellington on a menu, he was happy. I got the Coq Au Vin which was just as hearty and delicious as I remembered. Since mine was a really generous size, A was able to have quite a bit.\n\nWe originally weren't going to get dessert but after watching other tables and seeing what they were getting, we decided to splurge. We had a very hard time deciding from their large list full of particularly tempting items but ultimately settled on the Banana Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Seriously, it is a must-order.\n\nAll in all, Cocotte is an awesome, cozy spot for some good French food. The prices are fine and the food is delicious. Giving it four stars based on our service experience this time (no fault of the bartender) though I could see it being a five-star experience if you are physically dining at the bar or have an actual table in the dining room.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Although parking was a bit tricky, we eventually made it here for our 6pm reservations on a Friday evening. It wasn't busy yet when we arrived, but others soon trickled in. If you want an extra special and romantic dinner date, make reservations for their curtain-enclosed table for two --very intimate!\n\nWe started off with some complimentary bread with an anchovy and basil olive oil. This pairing was amazing and so yummy. I loved how the breads were a rustic sourdough that were the perfect slices and size to start us off. We also each had a glass of wine (a red and a white) from the HH menu for $8 each.\n\nFor our main courses, we shared the Beef Filet Wellington ($34) and the Half Chicken ($15 on HH/$21) with Shishito Peppers. I was most eager to try the beef wellington, which was great but not quite memorable. It comes in two palm-size slices of pastry-wrapped tenderloin alongside a bone marrow. If you're into bone marrow, this dish comes with it all. Unfortunately, the boyfriend and I don't find the hype in bone marrow as I had the spoonful of fatty juices from it. It's still delicious though. As for the chicken, it came with four pieces. The flavor was there, but a bit dry. We definitely needed the sauces to dip in, which we found rather flavorless as well.\n\nThe highlight of our meal might have had to be the shishito peppers. They were incredibly flavorful and had such a killer spice to it. There was one that burned me for a few minutes. Trust me, I can handle spicy but that pepper was insanely hot!\n\nWe left fully stuffed and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The cozy restaurant has a lovely ambiance and solid food, although not quite memorable in taste.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

First off, my 3 girlfriends and I had a 7:45pm reservation for a birthday dinner - it took 30 minutes to be seated with no apology as we were continuously being shooed around the tiny entry way of the restaurant. Second off, the waiter told us to order WAY more food than was necessary for the table, so we were left having to waste so much food and money at the end of the meal. Thirdly, it took 4 requests to get any water, and 20 minutes to get more toasted bread after asking multiple restaurant staff members. The table next to us (and all tables around us) sat down after and left before we were served any food. \n\nThe food itself was delicious, however the disgusting service has made me never want to return nor recommend the restaurant to any of my friends in the neighborhood. \n\nThe most challenging part was that after complaining, no restaurant staff offered to comp any part of the meal, bring a dessert for the birthday girl, or even apologize for that matter.

Tough area to find parking- the trolley runs through here too. \n\nWe sat down on a Saturday evening, the small room was mostly full and filling up while we started. It's a cool ambience - the front is open to the sidewalk and there's a compact but well put together bar on the right as you walk in. My friend brought in a bottle of Parador Reserve Tempranillo - and older vintage that was drinking perfectly. The waiter came over and opened the bottle. He was a very tall waiter, good attitude and said he made wine. They were pouring the Barbera and Grenache '11 at the restaurant. So we tried a glass of each. He admitted they didn't look great - they didn't and they we're just okay. Tasted like the wine of the day that they're getting rid of - or maybe use it in the Coq au vin. I suggested he taste our wine and he poured himself a full glass - which in my opinion was too much. You always let the customer pour how much, but okay let's eat. \n\nWe split an order of the Mussels and we both thought they were excellent. I wouldn't call it abundant but a good portion. The sauce was outstanding and required drenching their small baguettes into it for full enjoyment. The bread was good - slightly crusty in the best way. \nMussels Mariniere $13,00 White wine, shallots, garlic, parsley, salted butter. And we had the French Fries with it that were quite good. \n\nMy friend then had the Beef Wellington (done perfectly) $33 and I had the Duck Breast special I think was $28. We also had some white wine by the glass. Overall a great experience - service was good, staff was friendly and on top of water, bread, plates - not too soon or too late. Friendly and appropriate. \n\nThe one thing that bothered me was the waiter selling us his wine that sucked, then pouring a whole glass of our expensive bottle and then charging us the full corkage of $20 bucks. That was bullshit - but maybe like his wine he's uneducated in how you deal with those situations. I asked him to take it off and he took off $7.50 cents.

We enjoyed the cable car and summer in Spain. \n\nWhen we got to ordering dinner, I was bummed to know they didn't have the dish I had been looking forward to all week - The Beef entree.

I was bummed but okay until I noticed the person right next to us who ordered the beef entree *after* us and the chef managed to get him the \"last serving\" they had.

If you're looking for a nice date night or special occasion, definitely stay away as this place does not have the right ambiance or vibe for it.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Prix fixe dinner which isn't always my favorite but I was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is beautiful, dim lighting, open but intimate at the same time. My husband had the fois gras two was to start followed by the beef Wellington. I had the goat cheese \"beignets\" and the rack of lamb. The fois gras stole the show in my opinion and I cursed myself for not ordering it. Had I not tried it I would have been plenty happy with my \"beignets\" though. Both meats were cooked perfectly and were well-flavored. For dessert I had the white chocolate napoleon and my husband had the banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.

We had reserved a table for tonight and had written in the notes that we were both using wheelchairs. Cocotte was not described as inaccessible to wheelchairs and we also never heard from the restaurant before we arrived. Only then did we learn that they have a step to get in which was too high for our heavy electric chairs to overcome. My partner had visited the restaurant many years ago and they then had a little portable ramp to help but this time they stated they did not have a ramp. When we expressed how disappointed we were that we had come all the way on public buses, the person we talked to, probably the manager, stated that \"well I can't do anything about this and I cannot lie myself down for you to roll in.\" I pointed out that this was the rather unnecessary and mean comment and he just turned away and left us standing outside of his restaurant.\nIt is hard to understand why somebody who is working in the hospitality industry has such little adeptness at making people feel taken care off, especially if their establishment made a mistake. But rather than trying to somehow make the situation better, this particular person added insult to injury. I'm now actually glad we couldn't enter the restaurant and didn't contribute to their business considering how their attitude toward accessibility as well as hospitality is.\nWe then crossed the street and were lucky to get a table at \"Seven Hills\" where we received exceptional service and wonderful food. We have reviewed them in the past and a review for this experience will follow soon as well.", "author": "Ursula S."}

It was a 3 course, $85 prix fixed menu with 3 selections each for appetizer and entree and 2 for dessert.  It's a small place with about 35 seats. They had called a couple weeks earlier to confirm and asked for a credit card to hold the reservation and if you canceled 1 week prior, they will charge your account. For that inflexibility of rules and asking for my credit card info, I wouldn't go back. \n\nThe couple next to us sat in this tiny space with a slanted ceiling more fitted for little people. He was a big guy in girth and height and because tables were packed together like sardines, he had a hard time getting out.  \n\nMy Foie Gras was meltingly smooth. It was a large disc which came with thin slices of bread. Hubby had the lobster. Some chunks of lobster which he said was too dry and served in a small cast iron pan.  \n\nWe both had the beef Wellington. It was OK. The puff pastry was good. It arrived with some Vegts and the beef was sliced in half.  We couldn't finish the other half and took it home.  \n\nThe banana crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e was better than Hubby's dessert. The server even messed up on delivering one of the dishes and the place wasn't full to capacity yet, around 6:30PM.  A health tax is auto added to the bill. Hubby had a glass of French red wine and the bill came to over $200. We were lucky to find street parking.  A nice neighborhood place which he heard about on Bay Area Check Please on TV.

That's what (yelp) friends are for, right?\n\nCocotte popped up on the search for a cute restaurant in the Nob Hill area. The cable car tracks are right outside, it's frequented by locals and it's the opposite of trendy! I like that. It's a very welcoming neighborhood space. \n\nWe enjoyed a feast of rustic French fare. From moules marinieres (tantalizing broth and plump mussels!), exquisite rotisserie chicken, mouth watering beef wellington with indulgent bone marrow, luxurious foie gras, a massive butcher cut pork chop and other tasty options. We also ordered several desserts. I mean, when you go out with yelpers, you go all OUT. \n\nI'm a die hard fan of duck and it's pretty much a given I'll order it 99.9% of the time when I'm at a French restaurant.

Janice made a reservation for 5 people via OpenTable a couple weeks prior.\n\nStarters:\n*Meat platter: bressola (cured beef), duck salami sausage, local dry coppa, chicken liver terrine, grain mustard, pickled vegetables, walnut & raisin toast ($18)\n*Beef tartar & foie gras tacos: hand-cut beef tartar, capers, cornichons, shallots, grated foie gras, pickled red onion, crema fresca ($14) x2\n*Mussels marinieres: lemon, white wine, salted butter, shallot ($13)\n*Duck foie gras mi-cuit: poached red wine bartlett pear, toasted house made brioche ($22)\n\nI'm a huge charcuterie fan, so I loved the meat platter. The mussels were plump and the sauce delish! I haven't had foie in a while, so mi-cuit was a treat! The tacos didn't have much foie flavor, but I do love crunchy tacos so this was a nice play on beef tartar.\n\nMains and Les Cocottes:\n*Organic Petaluma chicken rotisserie served with romesco sauce, arugula pesto, creamy porcini sauce accompanied by a cocotte of your choice: Cauliflower & espelette pepper gratin ($32 whole chicken)\n*Beef wellington: maitake mushrooms, veal jus, bone marrow, breadcrumbs ($33)\n*Duck leg confit: oven farro pilaf, spring onion, blood orange gastrique jus, living watercress ($24)\n*Butcher cut: Pork ($28)\n*Spinach: golden raisins, garlic apple cider ($7)\n*Hand-cut french fries: lemon aioli ($7)\n*Cocotte of the day: Brussels sprouts ($7)\n\nI adored the special which was pork. I love a nicely cooked piece of pig. Mmmmm... meat! The duck was deliciously tender. I wasn't sure if I'd like the beef wellington due to the puff pastry, but surprisely, I did. And that piece of bone marrow? Sooo good! I'd skip the chicken next time as it was super dry and overcooked. At least the breast piece I tried to eat was. My favorite cocotte was the cauliflower gratin. And I don't even really like cauliflower. It was deliciously creamy. Like potatoes au gratin. I love spinach, but I wasn't a huge fan of the raisins. My least favorite cocotte was the brussels. They were a little undercooked and needed more oomph. They just tasted like cooked brussels which I found kind of boring.\n\nDesserts:\n*Banana creme brulee ($7)\n*Profiterolles: marsalla raisin ice cream, almonds, chocolate sauce ($7)\n\nMust have dessert is the banana brulee. Although the bananas keep it from having that hard sugary crust, I adore banana desserts and a good creme brulee, so this married the two well. I'm not a huge chocolate person so I only had a bite or so of the profiterolles. Everyone in my party enjoyed them though.\n\nDrinks:\n*Chateau respide-medeville graves '11, Bordeaux, France ($55)\n*City cellars ($15 glass)\n*Pied a terre cab ($15 glass)\n*Porto ($14 glass) \u00d72\n*Muscat ($14 glass)\n\nWhat's dinner without drinks?! I told the server I wanted a good red that was moderately price. Told him I'm a cab girl and he suggested the Graves. This worked great for our party! I also had a follow up glass of wine that he suggested as well. I believe it was the Pied a terre cab though. I actually enjoyed that glass more as it was a bolder red.\n\nCocotte has a charming neighborhood restaurant feel to it. A great place to have dinner with a wonderful group of friends.\n\nNote: Remember to check your bill to see if they added gratuity to it already. We were a party of 5 and they added an automatic 20% gratuity. (I always thought this only happened to parties of 6 or more. I guess every restaurant is different.)

Everything started out ok but got worse the longer we were there. The restaurant got louder and louder until we couldn't converse. Our entrees took an hour and came overcooked. Service was ok but for what we paid we should not have gone without plates and silverware for our appetizer. No spoon for the bone marrow. No real attention to detail as far as table service. We don't mind dropping money on good food and service but we felt cheated here.\n\nThe long story-\nBread was tasty and warm and served with a healthy amount of real butter. Off to a good start!\n\nDuck empanadas were just ok, meat was a bit dry.\n \nThe fries were just fries and did not dictate an $8 price tag, though the lemon aoli they came with was quite nice. \n\nThe Brussels sprouts were overcooked, a bit soggy and did not have any real flavor or texture. Mind you, none of these sides came with the entrees. $9.\n\nThe beef wellington was ok, but not amazing and was $32 with no sides. It did come with a marrow bone which was prepared well but was only about a half tablespoon of marrow in it. The meat was ordered medium, was served well.\n\nThe half chicken looked pleasing enough. $22, no sides. Served with 3 sauces. The cilantro pesto was very lovely, porcini sauce just alright and the 3rd sauce was a lackluster mystery. Our server didn't bother to tell us about the sauces. Chicken was overcooked, a bit dry and not particularly flavorful. Honestly, the Costco chickens surpass these easily.\n\nThe creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was the worst I have ever had, think jello banana pudding. There were cold spots throughout and no crunch on top. This was possibly the most disappointing failure in the meal.\n\nWine was spectacular. No complaints here. $45 bottle. Good to the last drop.\n\n\nThe restaurant itself is cute enough, dim lighting, candles. Why the hell are we listening to Outkast? I like Outkast but it sets the wrong tone. Small. There are too many damn tables in here. We had to physically move our table to let other patrons pass by. This is unacceptable. The waiter bumped my husband with his ass every time he went to serve the corner table. This is so freaking not kosher. Take out a few tables and give better service and food. The kitchen is obviously unable to keep up, our food took over an hour.\n\nFinally, the place doesn't look very clean when you go back to use the restroom. Very dusty. The toilet seat is hanging onto the toilet by a thread. Why on Earth would a place where an average p/p dinner tab is at least $50 not by a suitable toilet seat. The bathroom itself was covered in dust and paper towels littered everywhere. Seeing what we spent here, using the bathroom should not have made me feel like I was in a dive bar in the TL.\n\nI simply can not fathom how this place has a 4 star rating.

While the food was OK - neither terrible nor memorable, the service was truly awful and downright rude.\n\nThe two things we will remember from this restaurant were that, first, a waiter gave us a nasty look when one of us ordered a salad for a main dish and literally asked, \"That's it?\" I'm sorry, but a waiter who shames someone like this at dinner simply has no class, and neither does a restaurant that allows this. And secondly, as our dinner came to a close, he told us that people were waiting for our table and that we had to leave. This was RIGHT after we told him we didn't want dessert. So, he immediately came to us with the check, without our solicitation, to kick us out. Now, it's not that we tried to skimp on our dinner or linger too long - we had multiple glasses of wine and had very hearty dinners and it must have taken over an hour and 15 minutes or so. But apparently the waiter must not have cared to provide a modicum of decent service because they had already added a 20% tip automatically to the bill for a party of 4. \n\nAvoid this place; there are simply way too many good restaurants in this area with polite and nice employees to waste time here.", "author": "Sylvia K."}

We are not too familiar with French cuisine, however we were open to trying new things. \n\nOur hostess sat us in the BEST table of the restaurant, which was this converted jacket closet made into it's own dining cove for 2 people. Folks who were sitting by us were scoping us out as it was decorated in a way to allow for privacy, but with elegant decor.\n\nUnfortunately, I was not feeling well that day, so my husband mainly had to enjoy his and part of my dinner while I watched.

I'd say it felt even worse, because one of my favorite SF restaurants is just across the street. That being said, the food and price point was one of the most disappointing SF experiences I've had to date. The friendly staff and beautiful location is all great, but then I had the food and I was just sorely sorely disappointed like I haven't been in a long time.\n\nI had the Coq Au Vin (a French classic) as well as the butcher's cut which ended up being the Restaurant week featured Pork Shank Osso Bucco. Wow, maybe they were too busy for their Restaurant week clientele, but the food came so bland, undercooked, and a hot mess. For the price point of $20+ a dish, with a couple of glasses of wine, I really felt like I had been robbed  with my experience tonight. \n\nThe Coq Au Vin felt anything but slowly cooked in wine, pancetta, carrots with the hen. It was seriously viscous and bland that felt like it was rushed together. \n\nAs for the osso bucco, I know pork is usually dry and blander, but wow it was also just rushed and bland. I think the fact it was featured in the Restaurant week portion just meant a lot of quantity and little quality. The kale and polenta was sadly the most prominent feature of this dish. When it came to the pork and natural jus, it was jus disappointing (haha apologies for the pun).\n\nAnyways, considering the plethora of quality French restaurants in SF, I'm sad to say Cocotte will not be one I visit again.", "author": "Joseph L."}

The waitstaff for the most part was very friendly, however the waiter/host was extremely rude and not hospitable.\n\nA few examples:\nWhen we were ordering wine, the few we wanted were out and instead of explaining that they were out due to popularity or flavor profile he simply said \"Those are the cheapest bottles we carry.\" We ended up just opening two bottles of our own wine after he said corkage was $20.00 per bottle. \nWe ordered the frisee salad which had persimmons as a garnish and NO pomegranate. When the salad came it had pomegranate, but no persimmons. When we asked him if we got the right salad he said \"Oh that's a garnish, but you see the frisee, that's frissee.\" We had to ask another waiter who then took the salad and just got persimmon shavings on top.\nWhen the bill finally came we were looking over it and \"by mistake\" he hit the corkage as $25.00 per bottle. When we asked him he said \"Oh yeah that was a mistake, the buttons are right next to each other.\" I don't know what kind of honest establishment wouldn't tell you that a button was mistakenly until you had to point it out.

The food was simply amazing! I had foi gras (which was on my bucket list - I wanted to try it at least once. And it was soooo gooood). It was a huge portion for an appetizer. Super creamy, very filling, too. With roasted bread and cumquats. Then beef Wellington for the main course. Awesome beef, super tender, little pink in the middle. It came with gratineed potato and parsnip (?). I opted for the added truffle ($20) on the beef, but was a bit disappointed. I had black truffles before and they were amazing, these didn't taste like anything though. Dessert was a banana creme brulee that was simply to die for. We are not big wine drinkers, so no wine for us. I had a special virgin cocktail made for me though, just because. It was very refreshing, because I requested \"something with grapefruit\". Hail to the barkeeper!\n\nI know Thanksgiving is a special day for the hospitality business, so I only take one star off for the ambiance. Don't get me wrong, the place is cute and on any other day it might be great that it's cozy... but I got bumped into by the waiter every.freaking.time he passed me, because everything was so cramped. And I wasn't able to take of my jacket the entire evening, because the door remained open, although the temperatures were below 50. The wait staff didn't mind of course, they were running around like crazy. The hostess even had a sleeveless dress on.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-18", "description": "Every trip in here it gets better and better. The food is wonderful, full of flavors, great presentation. I love that the menu sticks with the French classics - coq au vin and the roasted chicken with cocottes is always on the menu - but throws in a little variety with rotating dishes. The foie gras is one of my favorites in SF.\n\nBut what takes the cake is Yuri, who runs the wine bar (he's the guy with the hair bun, who stylishly manages to pull it off). Yuri is a fantastic local purveyor of wines but is also a wine maker. His new venture, City Cellars, is now featured on the menu as of this year and every bottle I've had, while 2011 vintage and still a bit young, has excellent flavor and will bode well in another year for drinking. They're affordable wines and with the added selection of great French and Spanish wines it's a treat to stop in here all the time to try something new.\n\nAnd despite my having been here only 3 times and spaced apart by well over 6 months each visit and with different people, he always remembers who I am and makes sure to greet me. I have restaurants I go into every weekend for brunch on Polk St. who don't remember serving me at all. That's one of the main reasons for why the ratings go up for me, aside from supporting wine makers.\n\nThe restaurant does run into trouble sometimes with having enough waitstaff on hand, though. But then again, we Americans have a strangeness for expecting fast service and immediate attention and truly, the wait hasn't been that long. But I do observe Yuri spending a lot of time running around to each table for more than just wine recommendations, so if you're sitting at the bar or waiting for a wine selection it might take a few minutes longer. Again, nothing obscene in terms of a long wait, but it does require you to be relaxed, not in a rush and ready to sit in for a good meal.\n\nThis is also not a good restaurant for a big dinner party. If you have more than 4 people, skip it.\n\nThe best news of all...little tourism comes here. It's all locals. So if you're looking to get away from that Salesforce conference that happens 3x a year, it's a good time to head north.", "author": "Alita M."}

It was served on a bed of a bunch of other stuff including pickled beets which were inedible (practically raw and impossible to cut with a knife). In all this dish is a fail because the concept is a bit highfalutin' and unnecessary - \"seared petrale sole, pickled beets, golden raisins and garlic, lemon yogurt and dill\". \n\n Best part of my meal were probably the french fries and the few nibbles I had of the duck foie gras. The chocolate cake fondant was dry and not particularly flavorful, other than a little bit of fondant. Wouldn't order that again. \n\nThe thing that made the evening was my great dining companions, but of course it being a Friday the noise level was high so it was more than a little difficult to converse.

By 6:30, it was packed! It also seemed like everyone had reservations also. \n\nWe were quickly seated and were given the regular menu, the SFRW menu and the drinks menu. The SFRW menu now reflects their menu posted online! I think the change was made after the ban on foie gras was removed. After ordering, we decided to check in on Yelp/look at Cocotte's photos/reviews. We were quickly told to get off our phones to enjoy the meal. Food wasn't even here yet. Felt attacked as we were the only ones told to put our phones away, and was unfortunately unable to get a photo of our appetizers. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Chicken Liver and Foie Gras Parfait and Mussels Provencale (But I think we got mussels with white wine sauce instead). It was my first time having foie gras, and it was pretty good! I enjoyed the combination of the parfait with the berries on the side. As for the mussels, this was probably the first time where they weren't overcooked! Each mussel was still plump, silky, and juicy! There was one bad mussel though at the end, it smelled deadly. \n\nFor entrees we got the Salmon with Squid Ink Risotto  and Handmade Fettuccine with Truffles. The fettuccine was sub-par, even with the truffles. It was bland and the serving was extremely small, just not that amazing. The salmon on the other was, was delicious! It was surprising, because the sauce tasted like Thai curry, so it had a bit of Asian flare in it. The salmon itself was so moist and soft, mmmmmmm so good. The risotto also did not disappoint. My boyfriend was a bit wary of the color but he enjoyed it as well! There was also some type of chips on it? Maybe plantain? But it was yummy as well.\n\nFor desserts we go the Banana Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the Molten Chocolate Cake. The desserts was probably the best part of the meal. The chocolate was warm and had chocolate flowing inside of it. The creme brulee had the best caramel topping, so crunchy still! \n\nOverall, would probably not come here again, but I'm glad I got to try Cocotte. \n\n\nP.S \nPretty difficult trying to find street parking, we gave up after 10 minutes of driving around.

They had ordered food from the happy hour menu which was due to end at 6 30. It was 6 28! The bar man who had taken their order had bolted into the main restaurant. I've seen that in a lot of places. Fortunately the hostess spotted our waving and said not to worry. She knew the girls had been there for a while and she would hook us up. She took my food order and said the bar man would take the wine. \n\nHe sauntered back a few mins later and just gave a weird smile saying he couldn't take the happy hour order. We pressed him and said that a) he'd bolted b) the girls had been there for a while as they sat with food in front of them and c) the hostess had nicely said that she'd help out. He just gave the sleazy smile again and said no. \n\nNow I get the fundamentals of a happy hour. But if you hit the road at the death it defeats the purpose. Also if you're a complete asshole to customers you've got some bigger problems. Like me telling everyone about this guy. \n\nPity.", "author": "Owen Conor H."}

The executive chef has been pumping out creative dishes since he started a few years back. He used to run specials everyday but sadly that has changed. I've gone many times over the years and have to say you can taste the love in this food.

Wow, the food was exquisite (don't use that adjective often) and the atmosphere is romantic and relaxed. This place serves the type of food that I want to cook -- refined but rustic dishes full of soul and love. \n\nWe arrived on the dot for our reservation and were seated immediately. Our waiter showed us to the best seat in the house, a two seater round table in an alcove. That certainly put a huge smile on my face, definitely a huge plus!! He went over the relatively short menu with us in some detail and offered a few suggestions. We decided on the duck platter, the trout and the half chicken with cauliflower gratin. \n\nThe duck platter had duck salami, house smoked duck breast and duck terrine. Three slices of a warm, heavenly multi-grain biscuit. My favorite was the terrine, it was delicate and well balanced. The duck salami was my fianc\u00e9's favorite -- it wasn't too fatty and packed a punch with intense flavor. The smoked duck slices was almost like prosciutto. It was a bit too salty for my taste and drowned out the delicate natural sweetness of the duck. All in all, a great start to the evening. \n\nAfter the waiter cleared the appetizer from our table, our mains arrived quickly. The fish skin was so crispy and not fishy at all. The flesh tasted buttery and the wonderful seafood sauce perfectly complimented the delicate fish. The mussels and potatoes were yummy, also. \n\nThe chicken came with three amazing sauces -- mushroom sauce, romesco sauce and a gramoleta. The chicken was moist and flavorful it didn't need the sauces to be a great dish, but the sauces took it over the top. I've had romesco sauce before, but nothing as good as this, it's a bit nutty, a bit sweet and 100% crack. I could put that over frozen patty of dry veggie burger and it would be good. The cauliflower gratin was fantastic too. The cheese compliments the natural sweetness of the cauliflower and the cauliflower itself wasn't mushy. \n\nFrom reading the other reviews, I couldn't resist and ordered the banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was heavenly. The banana were thinly sliced and a bit overpowering on the first bite, but the vanilla flavor really comes through after another few bites. The custard was smooth and not too sweet. It was certainly a great end to the evening. \n\nI love this place and hope to come back soon!! It's a true neighborhood gem and I hope it all the success :)", "author": "Alice W."}

Upon arrival, there was only about two parties seated, but when we left, they were pretty much a packed house. Parking is always hard in Nob Hill so be prepared. \n\nFor the night we started with the duck platter and a glass of the Old Bay sauvignon blanc. The duck platter was really good. Make sure you save your bread for this because the serving was quite generous with the pate. My favourite was the duck sausage, but my dining mate loved the pate the most. I loved adding a bit of arugula and the dijon mustard into the mix brings the flavours together so well.\n\nFor our main course I had the squid while my dining mate had the beef wellington. I had a bite of his beef wellington and omg, it was perfect. It came with a side of bone marrow, but it was definitely fine on its own. The crust was nice and flakey while the meat was nice and medium rare. I was definitely more jealous of his dish. The squid in the forbidden rice was definitely good. If you don't mix up the rice in the sauce though, the meal can get a bit on the salty side. We ordered a side of cauliflower gratin which was really yummy, but we were pretty full to actually finish it. I've been craving something au gratin and I am so very happy they had a cauliflower option and not just a potato option.\n\nI was hoping to find some foie gras on this menu but sadly not even the specials had any. Overall, a great experience and service!", "author": "Crystal V."}

He had reserved the little nook with curtains, which I thought was super adorable. We ordered:\n\n1) meat platter: we both like the pate the best. It actually went best with the complimentary bread rather than the walnut and raisin toast that it came with. Interestingly, the complimentary bread also came with very garlicky tapenade, which I also enjoyed and I am not a fan of olives. I think the garlic drew me in.\n2) Soup of the day: sunchokes with pumpkin seeds. It was pretty good and the pumpkin seeds added a nice crunch to it.\n3) Rotisserie chicken: the chicken was dry, and the skin was fairly salty. I actually wasn't a huge fan of any of the 3 sauces that came with the chicken, and we were glad we went with the half chicken instead of whole chicken entree. We chose the potato gratin with goat cheese as our cocotte to go with this dish, and this was definitely the best dish out of everything we got! It was creamy with a nice slightly burnt cheese to the top.\n4) Parpardelle: homemade for sure, and a fairly large dish but not very memorable otherwise.\n\nWe also got a glass of wine to share. Speaking of sharing, they encourage diners to share food with one another but made it very difficult to do so. Our waitress seemed to always be in a hurry and didn't make us feel welcome. We'd flag her down for an extra bowl and she'd leave before we could ask her for an extra spoon for the soup.\n\nMy boyfriend had read online that we could draw the curtains to have a truly private dining experience. When we tried to draw the curtains, we were told by the waitstaff that it wasn't allowed. Maybe it's against the fire code? Whatever the reason, we were pretty disappointed since it was so loud. Despite being in our own secluded corner/nook, the noise in the restaurant seemed unusually loud for the venue. \n\nThe service was overall the biggest turnoff to this place and the food was not enough to make up for it. We probably won't be back.", "author": "Kat Y."}

The service, food, and ambiance is impeccable for the reasonable price.  \n\nI arrived 30 minutes with a reservation for two, but they sat us without hesitation in a cozy nook in the back - perfect for a romantic dinner.  The server was a French gentleman who kept us entertained with his frank assessment of each dish.  \n\nWe tried the rabbit ragu, which was to die for - easily six stars (out of five).  We also had the hand cut beef tartar, which was delicious, though following the rabbit, didn't overwhelm.  For the main, we died the 1/2 chicken rotisserie with three sauces with a size of brussel sprouts and french fries.  The chicken was deliciously moist, and the sauces gave us each something to love. \n\nWe each had a glass of wine.  I wasn't too impressed with their wines-by-the-glass menu, but can't speak to the bottles.  \n\nAll together, I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  But then I got it - with dessert.

I was excited to dive into the menu after perusing all the reviews and photos. We had a 7:30 reservation on a Sunday night and when we got there the place was poppin'. It's cozy and intimate, the menu reads all kinds of deliciousness and the wine is mostly French, yay! Ultimately, the I find a fair value in this place, given that San Fran can be pricey. The food was nothing revolutionary and the service could use improvement, but all in all it was good. \n\nWe started with and order of mussels and smoked salmon. My only memory of the mussels is that they were unremarkable. There was nothing really notable about them. I expect more from the bay area. The smoked salmon on other hand was easily the highlight of the evening. Served with blood orange, creme fraiche and dill it- was buttery \nperfection. \n\nThree of ordered the roast chicken to share. It comes with three sauces - gremolata, romesco and mushroom - I enjoyed all of them . There was plenty of chicken for the three of us and for real, it every bite was juicy. Was it the most flavorful roasted chicken ever? No. But it was a solid roasted chicken none the less.\n\nWe also ordered spaghetti squash and goat cheese potato gratin for side. Both were tasty. I would've liked to taste more goat cheese on the gratin, but it wasn't a deal breaker. \n\nService was a bit disjointed. We were seated, the server took drink orders literally one at a time and brought them to the table one at a time. Perhaps because the bar was at arms length from out table? Still....awkward...and inefficient. He disappeared a lot throughout the night and really hurt his check average because I could've easily ordered more vino., but if ya snooze you lose.\n \nAll in all, Cocotte, is a nice, but in a city that offers so many culinary and service experiences, I won't necessarily be rushing back here on my next visit.

But luckily there were plenty of tables not because it was empty but we were just lucky I guess, because it got full quickly after we were seated.   And the host was nice enough to get us a table right away.  The place is pretty small but it was not cramped, they made it work, it was pretty cozy and intimate actually.  They have nice interior decor and the ambiance is both friendly and very comfortable, I really liked it.  So, the host was very nice, the barkeeper was also nice who was nice enough to recommend the Grimbergen dubbel, which I really liked. It was flavor and almost sweet.  It was really delicious.  The server was also nice, she was patient with me since I'm actually ignorant \n\nSo, on to the food:\nDuck platter:duck & sunchoke rillette, duck salami, house smoked duck breast, walnut muffin, red onion pickles, grain mustard.  This is very delicious, I like the rillette the most, it full of flavor yet light and not very rich, which is great in my opinion.  The duck salami is also very good but if I'm forced to choose one, I'll go with rillette.  Good thing it's a platter.  I don't know how they know but the grain mustard is the right condiment.  I took a piece of the walnut muffin and put on rillette, salami, duck breast, the red onion pickles and top if all off with the grain mustard and put them all in my mouth, it's not finesse but it's an explosion of flavors.  \n\nPotato gratin with goat cheese:  Very tasty.  Enough said.\n\nbeef filet wellington:wild mushroom, puff pastry, beef jus.  Never had beef wellington before so I was looking forward to tasting this and it was worth having it here for my first beef wellington.  The beef was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the pastry was crisp, light and airy, it was great.  It was so good that I finished it in record time, I did not time it but it was pretty fast, my friend was impressed.  \n\nBranzini sea bass: Anchovies crust, couscous, sweet'100 tomato, lemon yogurt & dill - my friend had this but she was forced to share it because I finished my food so fast, I think she felt that I must still be hungry?  So, she gave me a small portion of the dish.  From the amount, I had I can tell it was very good.  I'd have this dish when I return again or maybe I'll have the duck confit.  Oh well, I might have to go back twice.\n\nbanana creme brulee: Okay, well, if you see the pictures of the after we've inhaled this, you could probably guess it's good, it's not good, it's very good.  \n\nProfiterolles: vanilla ice cream, toasted almonds, chocolate sauce - All I can about this is it had ice cream placed inside a crispy, crunchy pastry with chocolate syrup.  The chocolate syrup was just a right amount so it was not drowning in syrup.  I know I said it on all the dishes - it's very good, but that's because it is!\n\nAnyway, I am in no way affiliated to this restaurant nor I know anyone who works here, but I was very impressed.  The place is very nice, clean, comfortable, small but layed out perfectly that it did not feel cramped.  The staff are phenomenal, I don't say this a lot because I think staff have to be friendly and nice because it's the nature of their job actually on other establishment they make you feel they're doing you a favor when they serve you, but not here, and I think the staff that were here that night (not sure if there are different staff on a given night) were genuinely nice.  And of course, the main character in this story of this establishment  are the food.  For the dishes we had, they were all delicious.  So, that's why it's a 5-star review.", "author": "Bob S."}

The restaurant is quite small, so the wait was understandable for a larger table.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Spanish red wine to start and later had a California cab.  They were both great, and the restaurant has a great selection of wines, particularly reds.\n\nTo start, I had the Gruyere Cheese and Thyme Churros (3/5).  These were served with a horseradish creme fraiche, which I really liked.  The churros themselves tasted similar to mozzarella sticks but were much more subtle and with a much softer, less stringy cheese.  Although I enjoyed the texture of this appetizer, I found the taste to be much too subtle and missing a \"punch\" that I expected.  My tablemates agreed.\n\nFor the main dish, I had the squid with forbidden rice, which was just amazing (4.5/5).  I love squid ink, and this dish did not disappoint.  The rice was cooked properly, the squid was soft and flavorful, and the beurre blanc was rich and a little tart.  The dish was wonderful, but definitely on the heavier side.  I was not able to finish this dish, but I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy friends had some other dishes, some of which I noticed that they loved.  A few of my dining mates shared the duck platter, which they actually devoured.  Another friend had the Beef Filet Wellington, which he really enjoyed.

We were seated immediately.  \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the house smoked trout rillette.  It was pretty tasty.  Definitely a nice smokey flavor.  It was served with toast and a small salad with arugula and fennel.  (4.5/5)\n\nFor mains we ordered a 1/2 rotisserie chicken with a side of fries and rabbit and mustard ragu.  The chicken comes with three sauces: gremolata, romesco, and porcini mushroom.  The chicken was good, but just a bit over done so it was not quite as moist as I hoped.  The sauces helped with the dryness and were all pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the fact that there were three very different sauces to mix up the flavors.  The house made french fries were quite tasty with the garlic aioli. (4/5)\n\nThe rabbit mustard ragu was quite tasty.  A really nice portion of house made fettucini with mustard seeds and parmigiano.  (4.5/5)\n\nThe service was friendly enough, but just felt a bit awkward.

On top of that we had asked for the music volume to be turned down and he flat out refused. He waited on us 2 out of the 3 times we dined there and his service is not even sub par. He focuses on his bar guests, waters were always empty, and he was slow to check in with us. He is the ONLY reason I am choosing not to dine here anymore. If you do come here request to not be seated in his section you'll have a better time that way. :(", "author": "Jon W."}

I finally settled on this place because while it is french, they did have things I thought my brother would eat on the set menu (beignets and beef wellington). I thought we were in trouble when he asked me what hors d'oeuvres meant. Seriously?! Are you sure you weren't switched at birth? When I explained it was a very common term for appetizer, and that many of the ingredients in the fancily-named dishes were things he liked he seemed to be more open to the experience, but I could tell he was reserving judgement till the food arrived. Luckily for me, the food was delicious and he actually ate most of his food until he couldn't eat anymore. Hallelujah! It's a Christmas miracle!\n\nThe waitress was really sweet and did not laugh at my brother's butchering of each dish's name (although I did). The service was excellent! Attentive and welcoming... just as it should be on Christmas Eve.\n\nAs for the food, I had the Dungeness Crab appetizer, Sea Bass entree, and the Banana Creme Brulee. My brother's roommate ordered the same appetizer and dessert but had the Lamb Shank instead of the Sea Bass. My brother had the Green Beans an Romaine Salad with Beignets, Beef Wellington, and the White Chocolate Napoleon. Even though I chose the lighter appetizer and entree, the three course meal was quite filling and befitting of a holiday meal. The creme brulee is banana creamy custardy heaven in a ramekin and torched by the gods (It is really that good and I've had a lot of creme brulee in my life... It's the dish that prompted me to study french and it's the first dessert I ever made when I was 16).\n\nEverything was delicious and plated beautifully, with one exception. The dungeness crab appetizer was awkwardly plated. While it was delicious, the plate it was on was really big and very brown. This resulted in the three elements on the plate being really far apart from each other with a big brown abyss between them. Also the brown didn't really complement the color of the sauce or the radishes. But that's a minor cosmetic flaw in an otherwise perfect meal. \n\nMerci beaucoup Cocotte!

The main course was served but it took them several minutes to bring the next two orders. The 4th person's dinner went AWOL and would never have shown up if we hadn't tracked down our largely absent waiter.

The inside has that distinctive, bustling atmosphere, that makes you feel like you're part of a pretty cool crowd. Props for that atmosphere!\n\nFor food, I ordered the duck platter as a main, and Chicken Livers Parfait as a starter. I wanted something light and shareable. Oh, and bottle of Oyster Bay Sauv Blanc. The food was fine, but I think I expected more from the duck platter. Duck is such a great meat to play around with, and could have gone with a bit more flavour. Duck salami just tastes like the salami you get from a store! The liver parfait had a lovely texture, and was decent size for sharing.\n\nOverall, service was attentive. I did notice that the year of the Oyster Bay that they listed on the menu was different from the one they served - my friend brought this to their attention, but was just wondering. Turns out they had a new shipment that morning and hadn't had time to update the menus yet. The server was very gracious in his explanation. \n\n3.5 out of 5!

We brought friends visiting internationally here.  We see them once a year, and had much to celebrate, (our engagement).   We brought 2 exceptional bottles of wine to share.  Our friends, who are restauranteurs, selected the first bottle from our cellar, and my fianc\u00e9 selected the second, as the first was not his preferred varietal. \n\nThe waitress informed us that she could only allow us to open one bottle, unless we got clearance from the manager.  The manager came to the table, and although it was clear he had the authority to allow us to pay corkage on the second bottle and open it, he refused to do so.  He was actually extremely rude, and said \"it's not my problem you brought a wine that he doesn't like\" pointing to my fianc\u00e9.  He indicated that he put a lot of time and effort into his wine list and we had to buy one of his wines,   We relented and ordered a bottle from the list, it was marginal at best.  \n\nThey were out of the mussels by 7:30.  The dish my fianc\u00e9 was most interested in.  We ended up having to pour our own wine all night. When we complained about not getting any wine service at the table, the manager brought my fianc\u00e9 a taste of some wine that he had made himself,  it was terrible.  And we still didn't get any service at the table.  \n\nThe chicken was dry and the waitress never explained that it came with different sauces.   My fianc\u00e9 never knew there were sauces (which had been placed next to our friend across the table who ordered the same dish) until he had finished eating his dry chicken. \n\nThe lobster salad, which used to have texture was drowning in beet mush, I can't even remember what I ordered as an entree it was unremarkable.  \n\nThe profiteroles were clearly frozen.  They tasted stale, our friend could not eat his.  The chocolate cake was dry and a hockey puck.  My fianc\u00e9, who loves chocolate could not eat it.  They still get 2 stars because their banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is still delicious and exceptional.  \n\nThe food used to be much better.  The service used to be much better.

Maybe she didn't like my straight forward, mono-man voice....BUT STILL! At least be a little more cheerful if you want more than that stupid mandatory 20% tip for table of 5 or more!\n\nThen the tall guy with medium length hair, 'stache and tattoos on the arm was so persistent on me ordering more food even when I said we're not that hungry.  I just wanted to share the dinky tacos and mussels(which was more than enough) with my manfriend. But no, this guy kept insisting me to get an entree too. So fine, I ordered the beef wellington. By the way, their entrees don't come with sides. I felt like I got tricked into getting a side by the way he asked, \"What would you like for your sides?\" instead of, \"Would you like a side with that?\"\nSo we ordered fries since we thought a side came with the entree. This is entirely our fault for believing that, but this guy is very sly with how he talks. Same goes for my friend, she ordered mussels and the waiter convinced her that fries would go really well with that, so she ordered fries too. We ended up ordering 3 orders of fries.  Now that I think about it, he should've said one order of fries was enough for all six of us to share.  I wish he had some integrity towards his customers. \n\nAND THEN, waitress #2 comes by and asks if we needed a box for the fries we barely even ate. HELLO?! Our entrees didn't even come out yet! Is that customary in America? Is it cuz we AZN? Ya'll wanted to kick us out cuz we the only AZNs here?! LOL\n\nNEEEEXT! They were really bad at refilling our water and picking up finished plates. The waiters saw the empty plates and bottles, but didn't bother to do anything about it. I felt that the busser had better service than the waiters--someone, PLEASE give him a raise.\n\nAnd FINALLY, the check. Just like Yelp reviewer, Jeff B., we had an issue with \"Scum staff\" regarding the bill. The waiter with the tattoo stated the printer was broken so he issued us a handwritten check.  When we got the check, it only had the total, 18% tip (we calculated this from the total that was given to us), and a grand total. We added up what we ordered (from the actual menu) and our total was different from their total.  We brought it up to the waiter and he was insisting he was right -- even though everyone in our party double checked our calculation.  The grand total seemed really off so we told the waitresses to give us an itemized check. We started to argue until the waiter told one of us to go up to the computer to look at the whole bill. Low and behold, if we had received an itemized check from the beginning, we would have realized there was an extra item added onto our bill and we would have been able to correct this mistake and avoided the whole argument!\n\nIn the end, he didn't bother to say sorry for all the inconveniences AND the embarrassment he caused. I wanted to confront him about that, but I was afraid \"scumbag staff\" would retaliate by overcharging my card. \n\nP.S.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-28", "description": "Since we only had time for one DAT choice this year, I finally chose Cocotte after poring over multiple restaurant menu choices.  We had reservations for 7 but still had to wait about 10-15 minutes since the place is small and was completely packed so reservations are definitely a must on a weekend if you have your heart set on this place.  Despite our intentions of just doing the DAT menu, I ended up reconsidering while going over the regular menu as we were waiting.  Everything looked so good that we wanted to literally try everything but settled for a sampling of 6 dishes.  \n\nFood:  Hubby ordered from the DAT menu while I ordered 2 apps and an entree from the regular menu.  \n\n1.  DAT App - Goat cheese spinach souffle which was a light, airy, and savory souffle that I wish was on their regular menu.  Hopefully the owner is reading this and will consider adding it on as it was that good!! \n\n2.  Chicken and liver parfait - Creamy and rich \"pate\" and so deliciously complimented with the red onion and marsala jam.   We could've used an additional piece of toast so you might want to save a small piece of your regular bread for what doesn't fit on your levain toast  \n\n3.  Farm Eggs \"meurette\" - One egg poached in Pinot that again could use more brioche to absorb all the delicious egg yolk that mingles so well with the bone marrow.  I literally did take one of the pieces of baguette from our bread basked and wiped up every morsel of flavor left on that plate \n\n4.  DAT Entree - Porc Shank Osso Bucco with potatos gratin and cauliflower - Although good, it wasn't as tender as I expected and not as flavorful as our other dishes and therefore the least memorable of all so for DAT entrees, you may want to go with one of the other two choices which the couple next to us raved about.\n\n5.  Coq Au Vin - I rarely order chicken when I go out since there's usually something else that catches my eye so I was pleasantly suprised at how much I enjoyed Cocotte's Coq Au Vin.  It was fall of the bone tender with a stew of carrots and mushroom that blended so well that sometimes you visually can't even tell if the piece you are spearing with your fork is mushroom or chicken so just let your taste buds talk to you.  \n    \n6. DAT Dessert - Banana cr\u00e8me brulee - Visually, this is a dessert for the eyes as much as the stomach, so much so that the couple next to us changed their order once they saw ours.  (BTW, if you were the couple next to us on Sat, would love to friend you on Yelp for more of your great recommendations).  Unlike most creme brulees, they had a thin layer of bananas on top before torching it so the bananas are still warm when you first bite into it and the rest of it still cool and creamy. \n\nParking:  Unless you have great parking karma, allocate yourself at least 30-40 minutes to find parking and expect to walk a good 5-10 blocks so wear comfy shoes or get dropped off at the restaurant.  \n\nService:  Although we had to wait a little bit even with reservations, they did periodically come by to give us updates which was nice and definitely make reservations.  \n\nAmbiance:  Because it is small, once it is packed, it is noisy and the spaces between the tables are small so may not be the best place for a quiet romantic evening out UNLESS you get the 2 person table in the alcove or maybe if you go right when they open.  But if you're there for the food and the energy, it's got both.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

I normally tip based on a decent bottle of wine and not the corkage fee. The waiter wouldn't budge on the one bottle rule. Needless to say I would not visit again. They actually lost cash by not a\nallowing a second bottle with corkage. First restaurant I have ever encountered with a one bottle limit. I have encountered the two bottle limit elsewhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-18", "description": "Cocotte's DAT menu looked pretty amazing, and they got pretty stellar reviews but unfortunately the food was overshadowed by the atrocious service. Cocotte - not worth it even during Dine about Town, unless you enjoy the bad after taste of poor service.\n\nTo begin, it took at least 20 minutes for the waiter to even stop by, and when he did he was visibly irritated and gave us attitude as he took down our order. Side note: food came out slow as molasses too.\n\n* Wine: The wine's are pretty affordably priced (~$40-50); a Yelper warned he was scolded by the waiter for trying to order wine before his entree, so I waited until after I placed my order but the waiter walked away without taking drink orders, and could not be flagged down for another 20 minutes! Great. More waiting.\n\n* Mussels: I was impressed by the hefty portion of (mostly) fresh mussels, simmered in a flavorful sauce that goes perfect with the complimentary bread. Don't judge, but I hate being wasteful so I asked to wrap up my leftovers (which I usually toss later anyway). My waiter responded with something like, \"Really?! Are you serious?? You know you will get sick, and if you do, don't even try to come back and complain to us because I told you so.\" That was the cliff notes version, tried to cut him off as he publicly dismissed me in front of everyone, but he talked over me. He might have been right, but it was so absolutely rude and unnecessary.\n\n* Flank Steak: I liked the sauce wasn't a thick puddle of gravy like at most French restaurants. There were 2 pieces on the plate, one was cooked perfectly and I have to say I enjoyed it, the other was overdone. The fries were fried in what tasted like 3-day old oil. My friend asked for her steak to be cooked longer, and instead of taking it back, he proceeded to school her on what medium rare is and how she didn't know what it is. After an awkward and tense exchange between the two, he took the plate back and returned with overcooked steak.\n\n* Salmon in Puff Pastry: What a unique and interesting concept, I loved the contrasting textures of the buttery pastry and the salmon. The flavors were good but the salmon was slightly overcooked. \n\n* Banana Creme Brulee: Way overrated. Needed more banana flavor and the texture was grainy, not smooth. \n\n* Apple Tatin: This wasn't so much a tatin, as it was a roasted whole glazed apple on a thin crust. Disappointing.\n\n* Chocolate Mousse: Meh.\n\nThe food might be pretty good, but you can find other restaurants that serve the same quality at an equal or lesser price point. Though I came in knowing the waiter might be a bit mean, I still got yelled at. Do not come to Cocotte.", "author": "Jess C."}

Not only does its popularity fill up the joint after about 7 PM, but its food keeps them staying.\n\nMy new friend Sara P. and I decided to try this place after it appeared on our \"New Places in San Francisco\" feed.  After I saw that they had Beef Wellington, I was instantly drawn in and wanted to try it so we thought we would try it together.  That's Yelp people for you.  Kind people that want to make friends and try good food.  My kind of people indeed.  You wanna make friends?  Join Yelp.\n\nIt wasn't an easy feat though, considering our schedules and the fact that the holidays are almost upon us but it was sure worth the trip!\n\nThe authentic French staff is so friendly and welcoming.  Get a drink at the bar first.  They have a great selection of wine and their specialty cocktail is a must try.  They don't have a cocktail list above and beyond this one drink, but this isn't really the place to sit and drink.  This is a place where you will be whisked away to South West France, where the food is good and the wine is plentiful.\n\nWe tried the ravioli appetizer which was a bit different from traditional ravioli.  Much thinner.  Almost like a wonton.  It had some type of beef in it, as well as mushrooms.  I felt that there was too much lemon in the broth, not the ravioli, but it was still delicious.  Especially for an appetizer.\n\nThe COQ AU VIN is a MUST try!  The sauce is so delectable and pairs really well with the Beef Wellington.  I recommend getting the Beef Wellington, eating half of it and mixing it with the COQ AU VIN sauce.  In fact, just request that they put the COQ AU VIN sauce with the Beef Wellington.  So delicious.  Back to the COQ AU VIN though, the meat was ok.  Dark meet that came with a few carrots and gratin potatoes.  Incredibly delectable.  I loved it.\n\nThe Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection.  A flaky pastry puff filled with beef.  I got mine medium, which I don't normally do but I think for this dish you really need to get it this way.  Only because the pastry is so delicate that you need to the beef to be softer.  Too tough and it throws off the balance of the dish.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some sauce stuff that wasn't really as good as the COQ AU VIN.  So really, request the COQ AU VIN sauce!\n\nDessert was good but I didn't want to eat too much so we got something light.  The GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLE TART TATIN was the perfect amount of dessert.  Basically just baked apples with a very thin crust/pastry at the bottom.  The perfect end to your meal.\n\nI really enjoyed this place.  I had great company, I really got to know my new friend, atmosphere and menu weren't too intimidating, staff was great and the food was just so delicious.\n\nI highly recommend to anyone in San Francisco.  Whether you are visiting, have people visiting or just want a delicious holiday meal.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nAmusez-vous! J'adore cet endroit.", "author": "Victoria C."}

No tables available (would recommend a reservation for dinner) but were able to snag a seat the bar which is also quite nice. Good wine list, fair number of french reds available of good quality. I had a Cote du Rhone and Bordeaux, both good. BF had the lilet apertif, sweet and yummy.\n\nCrusty bread with a pesto-type dip brought out which was delicious. For dinner, he had the New York Strip with french fries and I had the Duck Confit with cauliflower. Absolutely delicious, everything. Some of the best steak I've ever tasted. Cauliflower was cheesy and rich, fries superthin with parsley and well salted. Confit also delicious with arugula salad on the side. \n\nFor dessert we shared the molten cake and each had a glass of port.

First time ever at Cocotte and they really won us over. It's a fairly small restaurant, not what I was expecting at all but I loved the atmosphere. All of the staff was really friendly and cheerful. \n\nDinner that night was a set menu at $80/person. The appetizers consisted of foie gras, poached lobster and beet salad or a goat cheese panna cotta. We both opted for the lobster and beet salad. Loved it but I'm starting to think maybe I should have gotten the foie gras for variety. My girlfriend thought there were too many beets and not enough lobster but hey, that's just more beets for me!\n\nThe entree choices were beef Wellington with potato gratin and bone marrow, seared u10 scallops over butternut squash puree with braised endive and potato gnocchi. She had the beef welly and I had the scallops. That scallop dish may have been one of the best scallop dishes I've ever had. There was this vanilla oil drizzled around the bed of puree that really gave the whole dish a beautiful fragrance and elevated flavor. The scallops were cooked perfectly and I've never enjoyed butternut squash, pureed or otherwise, the way I did that night. My girl's beef Wellington was so tender and juicy and the duxelles were so delicious. The bone marrow had a light dressing of pesto that brightened up the fattiness. \n\nFor dessert, our choices were apple tarte tatin, white chocolate Napoleon and banana creme brulee. Napoleon for the lady and the creme brulee for myself. I personally enjoyed the creme brulee more but that's not to take anything away from the Napoleon. It's what you would expect from a creme brulee. Smooth custard, caramelized sugar topping it. Except there were banana slices set into the top of it with the caramelized sugar over the bananas. That gave the banana slices a nice, crisp crunch. I don't even have words to really do it justice. You'll have to try it for yourself!! We can't wait to come back here for their regular menu.

I made reservations for an early Thursday evening for my bfs Birthday. \n\nWe were seated right away and served water by a very nice young man. Then, after moving around the menu, trying to nicely suggest to our waiter, whom we hadn't met yet, that we were ready to order, he finally showed up. After taking our drink order, he arrived after another 5 minutes with one beautifully poured beer and another that was half foam. My boyfriend nicely asked for a different one, because why would you spend $6 on a half a glass of beer? He kindly showed him the glass and the waiter said it was from a bottle, so that's it. That told me that he didn't care, and it was his carelessness in pouring that caused the beer issue. \n\nOur food arrived quickly, and it was amazing! The Beef Wellington was everything my boyfriend had hoped for. I'm not sure we saw our waiter again until our table was clear. He asked if we'd like another beer (should've been on the house, considering the other one) but we declined without mentioning why. \n\nIn all, I felt judged. I felt like our waiter saw myself and my boyfriend as people who scrimped and saved to have a special birthday dinner, and we couldn't know or afford anything on the menu, so why bother. Well sir, that is not the case, and if it were, it shouldn't matter. Treat everyone with the same respect, and give the best service you can, regardless. Customer service is a skill, and one that you choose to only have when a table of two is going to order an entire bottle of wine. \n\nTip of my hat to the chef, but to our waiter, learn how to pour a beer and don't judge a book by it's cover.", "author": "Debra F."}

I noted in the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early and checked in w the hostess, who said our table wasn't quite ready yet and she would let us know. It's a small space and we were the only people waiting to be seated, so we stepped outside (mind you the front is a completely opened garage so we were still in view of the hostess, about 7 feet away).\n\nOver 10 minutes pass and another couple rolls up, checks in with the hostess and stands around for 5 mins, at which point they were seated...\n\nI immediately went up to the hostess and asked if they had a reservation, bc we did and had  now been waiting for over 15 minutes now.\n\nShe said oh, there was a cancellation (so, no they didn't have a reservation) and apologize because she didn't see us..\n\nOur soon-to-be-server (tall, dark-haired male) was now up at the hostess podium while she seated the other couple. I let him know we had been waiting, it was also a BIRTHDAY, had a res and this walk-in couple was somehow seated immediately, while we continued to wait. He claimed the other couple had a reservation and our table was yet again, \"almost ready.\" Well that's interesting, since the hostess said they were a walk-in bc of a cancellation, and now the server said they had a reservation, so someone is lying....methinks it was the waiter.\n\nA few minutes later, we are finally seated.\n\nWe asked the waiter, the one I spoke to before, for water immediately upon being seated. We also ordered drinks and salad, which he brings. Still waiting for the water, we patiently remind him about the water...\"Yup, still working on those waters!\" Not sure what that even means exactly?? but we played along and were still quite friendly with him.... A quick glance around, and everyone else has water, including the table he was waiting on who actually came in AFTER us.\n\nAfter the entrees were brough, our waiter was pretty much MIA.. the bus boy eventually  brought the water, after we asked him the first time. The waiter did pass by our table many times (it was hard not to, as the space was so small), but always seemed to be looking off in another direction as if he was purposely avoiding us.\n\nBy the end of the meal, our server still had not checked in with us since the ordering of the entrees, despite the restaurant now being less than half full! Meaning he only had FOUR other small tables to attend to. We wanted dessert, but contemplated bc I was pretty much over the service. The server did show up at our table once more and We did get the banana creams br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was also great. The server wouldn't know this though, because he never once checked in about how our food was.  I found this kind of strange, considering we were spending well over $100. Now, we have NEVER tipped below 20% when eating out, and we ended up being extremely generous with an 18% tip, though he didn't deserve it at all, but I would have probably felt bad had I gone any lower. I was sort of expecting a free drink or something, but of course not.  It's too bad the service was so shoddy or I would definitely return for another round of beef wellington.", "author": "S. V."}

If you're having dinner for two be prepared to hear the conversations from either side of you.\n\nWe decided to share some of their appetizers and entrees. Originally we were going to do Dine about Town but decided that we preferred their other dinner options over their DAT options.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nChicken liver parfait: If you have read my other reviews, you will discover that I LOVE chicken liver parfait. The chicken liver parfait at Cocotte is not bad, but definitely not the best I've ever had. It comes with a sweet jam (which is typical) and a couple pieces of bread. I would have preferred a little more fat content in the Chicken liver parfait, but it definitely satisfied my cravings after not having it for a while.\n\nFarm eggs meurette: Bone marrow with egg poached in pinot noir? Sounds intriguing. The bone marrow was tasty, but a little small for my liking. Not a huge fan of the wine-y egg, but it was definitely unique. My favorite part of this dish was scooping the marrow out of the bone with bread.\n\nEntree:\n\nDuck confit: Flavorful duck over a bed of lentils (?) and pork belly. Very little pork belly, but generous portion of duck. My only gripe is that the duck was a little dry. However, the skin was crispy and done well.\n\nOverall the meal came to be around $40 which I believe is a steal compared to the dishes we tried.

I made a reservation here for a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy at 7pm. The place was super small and dark but cozy with a nice ambiance. \n\nFood: They give you complimentary bread and tapenade and it was excellent! That spread was an amazing mix of olive oil, olives and capers. We ordered 3 entrees: the scallops with squid ink risotto ($24), a half chicken with fries ($15), and pork belly with potato and goat cheese gratin ($19). My absolute favorite was the scallop dish. I've had squid ink risotto before and this was out of this world! And it doesn't turn your teeth black. The rice was cooked perfectly and was rich and creamy and topped with basil foam. These were all flavors I had never had before. The scallops were succulent but a little on the salty side. The pork belly was my second favorite. Thick slices of pork were served on a bed of greens and caramelized onions and veal au jus. The broth was full of flavor and I liked how the pork belly was very lean. The gratin was decent but nothing spectacular. The half chicken was my least favorite. I thought the seasoning/spices on the skin were good but again, nothing special. The meat was also a little dry and the 3 sauces that it was served with did not stand out. The side of fries were tasty and I loved the aioli is was served with. \n\nPrices: Reasonable for french food. \n\nService: We were very pleased with the service. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.\n\nBathroom: The area outside the bathroom was an eyesore and smelled bad because the dish washing area is right in front of it.

The food was excellent but with service like this, I would absolutely skip this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-06", "description": "Food: If you are going to Cocotte for the first time then you have to order the Rotisserie Chicken! It is so flavorful and tasty!!! You can order a 1/2 chicken or full chicken. I will say my petite friend and I ordered a 1/2 chicken to share and we politely fought over the delicious meat and agreed that next time we'd order a whole chicken (it is just that good!). The chicken comes with sauces on the side which I don't think are necessary since the chicken is already so well seasoned for taste.\n\nYou get a side (or \"cocote\") when you order a chicken which turns out to be a pretty good deal. The Yukon Potato Gratin with Goat Cheese is incredible and one that I can never pass up! I also am a sucker for their French Fries and aoli sauce. \n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is very small. There is a bar where you can sit and enjoy a drink while you wait for your table. It is very odd because some nights it is packed (no reservations available and not a chance to get a table) and other nights you can get a table no problem. I highly recommend making reservations here. \n\nLocation: Cocotte is located on Hyde Street which is the same street the cable car runs on. If you are visiting and staying in downtown or Fisherman's Wharf you can easily take the Hyde Street Cable Car here for dinner (just make sure to leave enough time). It is a pretty great way to commute to dinner and you can get off right in front of the restaurant. As a heads up, finding parking around the restaurant is not easy.\n\nTake Out: Cocotte offers \"Rotisserie To Go\" which is there version of take out and it is awesome! You can call ahead and order a chicken and some sides for a great last minute family dinner. It is reasonably priced for a quality takeout dinner for two given how much food you can order for around $30. Heads up that parking is hard to come by in this area and double parking is a big no-no because it blocks the Cable Car tracks.  \n\nOverall: I give Cocotte a low 5 for the high quality food that is always well prepared and deliciously flavorful.", "author": "50 State By 30 T."}

Boy, how wrong were we...\n\nFirst, service was really terrible.  After our 1st pour of water and taking our orders,  the waiter never stopped by once until when we flagged him down to take our plates away and that we are ready for dessert course (all dishes were brought to us by a Hispanic man who works in the open kitchen...more on him in a sec).  For savories, we got the mussels which tasted just mediocre, the duck confit which wad decent (was tender, I'll say),  and the coq au vin which was also just ok (also tender).  For dessert,  we got the banana creme brulee which def was the best experience all night.  Oh, I will also give credit to the simple yet tasty tapenade that came with the bread basket. \n\nNow onto the Hispanic staff member.  While he was cleaning off the table next to us, he knocked the entirely full jar of tapenade right onto my right leg. Despite it being a small dipping bowl, it was full so all the content was on my jeans and shoe.  Without an apology, the guy looked over at me and went back to bussing the table.  Yes, I understand it's a busy night,  but you can still say sorry and offer to bring a wet towel right?  Nope...I had to ask him for one before he was abt to walk away and when he brought it over,  it was as if I was troubling him with a stupid side task.  Since oliver oil doesn't come out easy, I spent time putting baking soda at home on my jeans and shoe with the hope that the stains will come out (I'll be calling you Cocotte if it doesn't).  \n\nIn the end,  the wife didn't want to leave tip at all but we ended up putting down 15% anyway just bc I felt generous and assumed that the entire staff including the dishwashing crew have a small cut,  too. \n\nThanks Cocotte for the lovely tapenade.

We had an early dinner reservation due to a show, so the place pretty empty when we got there. The staff was engaging, and the chef talked to us quite a bit. It is clear that he loves cooking, and seeing the place fill up is \"showtime\" for him.\n\nWe started out with the Mussels Poulette. I lobbied for splitting them (the boyfriend wasn't too excited), but we ended up having to fight for every last morsel. The creamy buttery sauce begged for crusty bread to sop up every last bit. Little bits of pancetta and trumpet mushrooms complimented the cooked-to-perfection mussels. It's a must have.\n\nMy boyfriend had the Butcher's Cut (which was a tender juicy bone-in pork chop). Served with of wilted kale, and this incredible cheesy, creamy, almost pudding-like polenta. I had to beg him to at least leave the bone on the plate. \n\nI had the Pork Belly. Fat was nicely rendered, with a gorgeous crispy skin. A luscious soft cooked egg made for a nice \"sauce\" to mix into the bulgur.\n\nSince we had more wine (ha), we HAD to have dessert.  We had Cherries served with a soft Financier cake. Again, the boyfriend was not enthused about ordering (claimed he was full). And again I had to fight him for at least half. \n\nWine list is good, with generous pours.

Terrible Service \n \nWe anticipated a wonderful evening as we've heard good things about Cocotte.  If you've reviewed the menu and it looks good to you, you won't be disappointed with the food as everything was prepared beautifully.  I had the rotisserie chicken and my partner had the coq au vin.  Both were wonderful. \n\nThe thing that was an unhappy surprise for us was the inattentive service.  We were seated at the table closest to the entrance to the kitchen area, so there was lots of staff traffic right around us, but it often felt as though we had been forgotten.  The couple at the table next to us was seated about 10 minutes after us.  The waiter immediately approached their table offering drinks and advice about the menu - we got the sense that perhaps they were regular customers.  He got to us some time after that.  It took some time for our salads to arrive. Upon the completion of the salads it was probably about 30 minutes before our entrees arrived.  When we finished our entrees we sat staring at our chicken bones for quite some time before they were cleared and we were given the opportunity to order dessert.  Our apple tarte tartin took about 20 minutes to appear.  I noticed it sitting on the counter and almost grabbed it myself, but did end up flagging down the waiter and pointing out that I thought our dessert was perhaps ready.    We were never offered a second beverage.  \n\nOur disappointment wasn't  just that things were slow, we're ok with a leisurely meal.   It's as though we weren't there and things only happened when the waiter stumbled upon us.  The couple seated next to us had the same items we had ordered plus a few additional items and they left about 30 minutes before us.

Get ready...holiday corkage! That's right, you want to drink that special bottle you've been saving for just such an occasion on Valentine's Day with your loved one? That'll cost you $25 instead of the already steep $20. The hostess told us corkage was $25, it said $20 on the menu, and the bill explained it with that new catch phrase: holiday corkage! The prix fixe was already jacked up way beyond the normal menu prices (which I've come to expect on V-Day), the waiter was pretty smug (part of the job description at a French restaurant) but the food was fine (the most memorable things for me were the olive tapenade and the crispy farro, not exactly the pricey ingredients)-- so I wouldn't even be writing this except it still bothers me that they would have the gall to squeeze out another 5 bucks that way.

Everything from the ambiance, to the service to the food, was impeccable. The staff really knows what they are doing, are friendly and accommodating. Reasonably priced, every dish we had was delicious. We ordered the meat plate which was delicious, containing excellent pate, and prosciutto. We also had the Halibut and a side of snap peas and quinoa which was amazing. It is a great place for to have a romantic evening out, whether it is your third date or your 20th anniversary.

It's what I get to eat when I'm hungriest.\n- The ambiance. It's simple and warm, but romantic and chic. Not your corner French bistro.\n- The Valentine's prix fixe menu. Nothing too elaborate, but pretty delicious and with sizes worthy of a man...who's not too hungry. I actually couldn't finish the main, though it likely was because I ate so much of that bread. \n\nOK:\n- Service. Definitely more positive than negative. Didn't feel like we were being rushed. Also, in their defense, the place was absolutely packed. It must make it harder to be extra nice and attentive.\n- Personal space. Proximity is part of the warmth and vibe of the place, but it's definitely on the you-are-also-dining-with-your-neighbor side.\n\nNOT LOVED:\n- The famed banana creme brulee. Coming from a Caribbean person who loves banana in anything (with soup, next to steak, in omelettes), you have to trust me on this one: it's not for everyone. They had an orgasmic chocolate dessert, so, do yourselves a favor. \n\nOverall, wonderful place.

We had the duck platter appetizer that was just perfect and what we wanted. We then had the squid. I never order squid but the waiter told us it was special and it really was, an explosion of tastes and something different. HIGHLY recommended even though this place is known for their rotisserie chicken. We also had the rabbit with homemade pasta and I really loved it. Their desserts are excellent, we had the banana creme brulee whcih is not to be missed and the profiteroles (very good but not as amazing as the banana). The wines were good and so was the port. The only dish that was bland was the cauliflower cocotte. Anyone with French roots would be disappointed- I was really looking forward to it and it was not up to par.\n\nI really like that it is a small, intimate space, it has a lot of character and feels homey which is great because I don't like stuffy French places and sometimes you have to settle for that if you want good, authentic food. Also, great romantic atmosphere. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed ourselves and loved the location, very quaint neighborhood.

I totally did not realize that Cocotte used to be Hyde Street Bistro (which I had dined at during a previous DAT, and left unimpressed). \n\nAMBIANCE: Not much seems to have changed between the days of the space housing HSB and now Cocotte.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, space is tight-- I had difficulty getting into my seat (the couch side) without booty bumping the neighbors... even after shifting our table over.  Oops. \n\nSERVICE: Friendly... friendlier than when it was HSB for sure.  But also did not seem entirely genuine.  J & I ended up being seated in the somewhat romantical alcove thingy (the small, private space under the stairs?)  It felt at once more intimate, but it also meant that we often felt ignored/forgotten by the staff.\n\nFOOD: J ordered off the DAT menu while I chose an entree ala carte.\nFrom DAT ($36.95):\n- Seafood puff pastry thing: Like seafood pot pie-- decent, pretty rich, nothing amazing.\n- Pork osso buco: This was fine.  J was not impressed, but I felt that it was par.  It came with a few sprigs of broccolini as well as some polenta.\n- Banana creme brulee: Delicious, as it was when the restaurant used to be HSB.\n\nAla carte:\n- Scallop with risotto ($28): 3 scallops that were on the smaller side seemed like a marginally stingy portion for the price.  The risotto was alright-- slightly mushy, but that's ok with me.  Flavors were good, and I enjoyed this dish more than the pork.\n- Brussels Sprouts \"cocotte\": Eh.  Nothing special.  Portion size is small for $6.\n\nOVERALL: I left satisfied, but not impressed.

Quiet too at 6 pm. Not so quiet at 7:30 but that's OK. At first I was a little put off by the lack of space but our neighboring patron, who was eating alone and a regular, chimed in and we all became good friends! I went straight for the chicken. We ordered a whole one with two cocottes: the cauliflower gratin and the potatoes with the goat cheese!!! OMG!!! The chicken would have been great alone. It was juicy, full of great spices! But the sauces...The porcini mushroom sauce was amazing, buttery but not overly rich. I also liked the pesto sauce, which was more like a chimichurri. The Romesco was too quietly boring for me, so after tasting it, I skipped it. The cauliflower was light and beautiful. Creamy, cheesy potatoes. We ordered a bottle of Chateauneuf Du Pape.

The place itself hasn't changed much: very intimate, cozy, with the kitchen right there next to you. But the food Cocotte serves is absolutely superb! Traditional French food with some modern twists and none of the pretentiousness of the higher priced French restaurants.

It's a cute and cozy neighborhood bistro that has somehow remained under the radar and fits nicely into the Hyde Street restaurant scene. My girlfriend and I have been to the restaurant twice and have ordered their rotisserie chicken to go. We're generally quite picky with restaurant choices and have been looking for a 'go to' neighborhood spot for reasonably priced, high quality and delicious food with a laid back atmosphere. \n\nThe ambiance is understated, but warm and casual and the staff friendly. It's a french bistro through and through, so If you're looking for a more upscale and refined dinning experience, I'd recommend Frascati up the street. But for a more casual neighborhood experience with good food and reasonable prices, Cocotte fits the bill perfectly.\n\nThe menu is varied and everything we've tried has been well received. The highlight so far has been the Farm Eggs 'Meurette' - poached in Pinot Noir with bone marrow, brioche, frisee salad, raspberry vinaigrette - which should be a strong candidate for the 7x7 top 100 dishes in the city in my opinion. The endive salad with crab is a great start and we've found the chicken to be moist and nicely cooked with the trio of sauces a perfect complement. \n\nOh and if you live in Russian or Nob Hill and are tired of Lemongrass, Aux Delices or your standard Asian takeout option, they have an awesome rotisserie chicken meal to go. A chicken, with three different dipping sauces and 3 sides cost $35. For sides, the cauliflower or potato au gratin should definitely be in your order. Pick it up on your way home and you'll have enough left over for lunch the next day.", "author": "Alex F."}

The mussels were a great choice, though - very flavorful, and a generous portion as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the meal was downhill from there.  The steak was overcooked (I had ordered a medium and it was completely well done and stringy) with standard fries and an over-dressed side salad.  The tarte tatin was very sweet, with nothing to cut the sweetness - a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, perhaps?\n\nService was fine...when our waiter was able to get to us - he was running around frantically!

We went to Cocotte on Bastille Day after a friend had long extolled the charms of Cocotte. Bingo: we loved it. Small dining room with an instant cozy feeling. No froufrou French decor: the place is modern and dynamic. The garage door-type at the front that completely opens up on a good day? Perfect touch for a small space like that. (True, my Darling Girlfriend tends to get cold easily, so it was not the best set-up for her on Bastille day - summer evenings in SF are on the cool side- but, hey, I kept her warm on the banquette we shared near the kitchen wall. Cozy.)\n I have been told Cocotte means both \"cast iron pot\" and \"chicken\" in French, and I testify the Cocotte chef knows how to cook a chicken. And puff pastry. And duck and mussels too.

The food is above average and is very reasonably priced.\n\nThey are very well known for their rotisserie chicken, which is a great deal, but the other items on the menu are great as well. I had the Osso Buco special for the night and it was exactly what I wanted and expected. The other diners at my table all had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken each, with comes with 3 sauces and a side of your choice for just $15. I tried a piece of chicken with each of the sauces and it was cooked well and very juicy.\n\nThe wine list was also impressive because, while it did not have any bad bottles of wine there were plenty of affordable bottles along with the pricier ones, mostly from France and California. I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner and plan to be back myself.

When I walk in at 8:58pm, I expect to be seated within 5-10 minutes...because guess what? Thats why you make a reservation. When we walked in, we knew this wasn't going to happen. Three other couples with reservations were at the bar waiting for a table to open up, too. This was going to be a 30-40 minute wait...with..wait for it...a reservation...on Christmas evening. Not acceptable. So, after the pudgy bartender/waiter/hostess told us we better have a drink from the bar because the wait will be a while, we left. No apology, just a smart ass offer. If this were 1895 in a saloon, I would have grabbed his bowtie from across the bar and reminded him what the word \"reservation\" means through a Clint Eastwood-esque whispery tone. May I remind you, it's Christmas. Here are some tips for Cocotte:\n\n1) If you expect it to be crowded, make your reservation intervals longer than 15 min.\n2) Don't accept reservations. Be like a Chinese restaurant in Inner Sunset and use a white board as a waiting list.\n3) Apologize when you make people with reservations wait.

My girlfriend headed in first for a seat as I knew it would be a journey to find parking.  After about 15 minutes I walked into the nice, dim-lit restaurant to see that we had a pretty awesome table - a little nook behind some curtains with a candle on the table.\n\nWe glanced at the menu and already knew what we had to get - duck platter for starters, half chicken, pork belly, potatoes gratin, and the fries.\n\nThe bread is delicious here, but if you ordered what I ordered do watch your intake.  The duck platter sports a lot of delectables but what stood out the most was the duck breast - this was absolutely delicious with the accompaniment of pickled onions and whole-grain mustard.\n\nNow onto the generous serving of half a chicken.  I sliced this thing up and each piece looked like it was sweating - that's how juicy this chicken was.  I tried each of the sauces but really appreciated the original rotisserie flavor of the chicken - I ate most of the chicken without any of the sauces.  The potatoes gratin I got for a side dish were absolutely amazing - I never had gratins cut so thinly; it is delicious when it is this thin.\n\nThe pork belly is chalked full of flavor - it actually came off a bit too rich for our tastes but who can blame it the dang pork belly was cooked for 6 hours.  The fries ordered with this were probably some of the best french fries I have had at a sit-down restaurant. \n\nTopped with 2 glasses of wine and champagne, this was a great meal for a random date night in the nice area of Nob Hill.", "author": "Christopher L."}

With that said I will now join the throngs who need to have their voices heard in hopes that I can be part of a solution to this problem.\n\nMy wife and I have been trying to find a reasonably priced high quality place near our neighborhood (Tenderloin) with no luck. During a walk one day we stumbled across Cocotte, which granted isn't quite our neighbor, and surrounded by other establishments that I know are of good repute. Either way it was walking distance so we gave it a shot.\n\nDefinitely worth it. The place is a quaint (ten tables and and a small bar) French place known for its Rotisserie. When we walked in the host was very pleasant and sat us in a dining room that was a bit dated looking, but I think that was the intent. Ill take dark and minimalistic over obnoxiously modern anyday (pardon the overt subjectivity.)\n\nThe server took a little while to approach the table, but he was clearly busy. Now I understand that the server in me is making excuses for what is a poor decision in staffing, but I say this more to point out that he was working hard opposed to just being nonchalant or lax.\n\nThe server took our wine order and while I couldn't ascertain his level of knowledge for wine because he was rushing, the pleasant host/manager was happy to talk to us about the bottle. The wine was great though the glasses were a bit underwhelming. I don't mean to nit-pick but nice service vessels, of all sort, are a touch that really makes a different in the overall aesthetic appreciation of a restaurant. Cocotte really could use an upgrade here.\n\nMy wife and I are a bit gluttonous when we dine out so we ordered our standard three apps, two entrees and a side.\n\nApps: Cabernet poached egg on brioche with bone marrow, a sheeps milk ricotta salad with beets, and chicken liver mousse.) all three were very good, with the poached egg being the highlight, liver is hard to botch which makes its execution actually a bit scary but they nailed it. Park Tavern has the best but this was very good. The salad was tasty but nothing to really espouse about.\n\nEntrees: Beef Wellington, Rotisserie Chicken and a side of Cauliflower. The Wellington was very good, the meat was cooked properly and the pastry was perfectly textured, I would have liked the sauce to have a bit more vibrancy to offset a dish the is a bit muted by its nature, but once again just a preference not meant to really be a criticism. The chicken was great, it's not easy to ensure with chicken that it retains its flavor once you go sub-dermal. This chicken had flavor to the bone.  It came with three sauces: Bordelaise,creamy porcini, and roasted bell pepper. All three were tasted though the bell pepper seemed out of place. Cauliflower was salty but good. We skipped dessert. Opting to imbibe a bit more.\n\nAll together our experience was very good. The food was consistent, tasty and well-executed. The service was friendly though a bit rushed. Our bill was less than a $140.00 for everything. Well worth a visit.", "author": "Aaron B."}

The service is slow and French, so don't expect a peppy American waitress checking in on you every second. \n\nMy friend's co-worker recommended this place, so I met her here after she got off work in the financial district. I drove up from San Jose and, luckily, found a parking spot on Hyde. I made the reservation for two at 7pm on a Wednesday evening, and we had no trouble being seated. \n\nThe interior is cozy and clean. There is a small bar on the right when you enter, perfect for a quick drink after work. The seating area is modern yet tasteful: wooden tables, proper chairs, and just the right amount of light. This place would be great for a date. It's the perfect size, in my opinion -- really great layout. \n\nOur waiter was French, so it was hard to understand what he was saying most of the time, but we managed and smiled. I ordered the 1/2 chicken and butter beans, while my friend ordered the halibut. We are both picky eaters and we loved our meal. The fish and chicken were excellently prepared. She ordered another bean side dish that looked better than mine. I think the butter bean ragu was a little unimaginative, but fresh nonetheless. I didn't like its aftertaste. \n\nAfter only two small entrees and sides we were stuffed! Overall, the total came out to $50 with tip, which is not bad for this city! There was a sign that said it's now open for brunch, so we might head back and try it again. \n\nTip: We didn't drink, but the wine list looked tempting and extensive!

Spent an awesome Saturday night filling up on wine and beef fat :) Cocotte has taken on the modern, causal, hip atmosphere, but instead of struggling to find new permutations of brentwood corn, heirloom tomatoes, and little gem lettuces like every other new SF restaurant, this place is making tried and true french bistro food. And it was so refreshing to see!\n\nRECOMMEND: Farm Eggs \"Meurette\" is a beautiful thing.  Perfectly poached, wine-soaked egg to spread on brioche toast with some roasted bone marrow. I know bone marrow is having a moment in SF restaurants right now, and I think this might be the best version I've had. I know egg yolk and bone marrow sounds a little overkill, but they work together beautifully! \n\nTartar with quail egg: great! Flavorful, but not over-seasoned so you can still taste the meat. \n\nSteak Frites: perfectly medium rare, juicy rib-eye and deliciously crispy salty fries for dipping in all that green-peppercorn meat juice. Simple. Happy. \n\nApple Tarte Tatin: More like a soft apple cake than the flatter tart I was expecting, but it was delicious! Love the simple sauce of creme fraiche.  Paired it with white dessert wine (of a name I had never seen before and of course forgot).\n\nATMOSPHERE:  I really like the casual atmosphere. Have to walk through the kitchen to go to the restroom... which I like for some reason. It was a little noisy.  We ended up opting for seats at the bar since we were afraid we wouldn't be able to hear each other if there was a table between us. \n\n*Bar seating could be improved a great deal if there were coat hooks under the bar!  Purse and jacket just ended up in a pile on the floor.... :-/\n\nSERVICE: A little disorganized upon our arrival. Although we made a reservation, they table wasn't quite ready.  We opted to sit at the bar, so there's no telling how long the wait might have been.  Bartender was very enthusiastic and friendly, but I had I had to help him out a bit and request menus and a wine list on my own.

It was nice to be able to get some old-school country French food amidst the preponderance of uninspired California/Continental cuisine in Russian Hill.  \n\nThat said, we went to Cocotte last night for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the way they updated their concept without losing what made them unique in the neighborhood.  \n\nIt's the same staff, 90% of whom are right off the boat from France.  They do an authentic French rotisserie chicken, which sadly we did not sample but will certainly do the next time.  They also put a bar up front with a focus on generally inexpensive French wines and cocktails.\n\nWe tried the lamb ravioli appetizer, which was excellent. Truly differentiated and perfectly done.  For dinner, my wife got the sole special, which was prepared lightly breaded and pan sauteed.  Light and delicious.  It was like taking the classic sole meuniere and making it lighter for the California palate.  I ordered a duck breast with fig slices and some kind of pork belly crisps.  Obviously super rich and over the top, but as to be expected.  At $19 it was a steal.  \n\nWe got the Brussels sprouts side dish, which was a tad salty for out tastes.\n\nThe wine list looked interesting too, but I was getting over a cold and my wife is pregnant, so we did not get a chance to sample any.  It's mainly inexpensive bottles from the big-name regions and vintages, where it's always fun to look for value.  Bordeaux, Rhones, Sancerre, etc.  Looking forward to trying them all out on the next visit.\n\nGreat food - great prices - excellent service - minus one star for being a bit salty or it would be a five.", "author": "M G."}

This fell closer to the delicious side for me and the wine cemented its place further.\n\nThe wait staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about the dishes and wine list. Their menu was somewhat limited regarding entrees but the options they do offer are flavorful and filling.   Also when I go to a good French place, I expect that it could take the better part of 2 hours for a meal, because it's French culture.

In a word: delicious.\n\nThe bill at the end came out to an almost even 100$ for two people (which is less than it would have been for just about any other French place of note in SF).

We showed up on a rainy cold night and were literally the ONLY people in the place on a Saturday night. Although it started filling up by the time we left, it was still pretty empty. There were three of us, so we decided to just order an assortment and share. We got the sheep's milk ricotta salad ($8), ravioli ($12), rabbit ragu ($11) to start. The salad was so small that the three of us only got about 2 bites each, but it was delicious. The ravioli was more of a soupy mess with some pasta thrown on top of the small dish, not very good, but the presentation was enough to ruin it for me. The rabbit ragu, however, ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Not good or inspired and quiet expensive for the 3 bites we each got. Don't get me wrong, I know these are small plates, but it just felt over-priced for the quality.\n\nFor the main we shared a whole chicken ($25) which was very delicious with the 3 special sauces it came with. We got the side of fries with the chicken which came with garlic aioli, which was a hit at the table. We kept passing the aioli around the table :)\n\nThe service was ok, but being the only ones in the restaurant, it was very surprising when they forgot our rabbit ragu until the end of the meal and when everything came out at once instead of in the right order.

I hadn't had it for many years & few places (hardly any that I could fine) offered it.  That's how I came upon Cocotte!  In addition, Yelpers seem to like it too.\n\nI made reservations for the family.   We walked there as it is very close to where I live.   It's a very small & cute restaurant.   If you like lots of space between tables & like ample size tables while dining - this won't fit your comfort zone!  Tables are very small & not that well spaced apart between you & tables to your left or right.  \n\nFirst, our waiter was excellent!  Very attentive, but not over us every minute.  The wait staff was also great!  \n\nWe ordered a Endive salad & Mussels to start.  I loved the salad.  I'm not a Mussels fan so can't speak to it.  My son finished it all so he must have loved it!   We ordered my favor - Beef Wellington, the Chicken & Rib Eye.  All the Entrees were excellent, except for the Chicken.  It was good - but it wasn't out of this world.   The Beef Wellington did not disappoint me & my kids really enjoyed the Rib Eye & Wellington.  We traditionally share our meals so we can enjoy everything.  We had the carrots, cauliflower & sprouts as veggie sides.  We enjoyed them all except for the baby carrots.  It just was okay.\n\nCheese cake to finish off the meal.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed this little place.  Great food, great service!  What more can you expect?", "author": "Marie E."}

Same location as where Hyde Street Bistro was.\n\nAll the reviews here about this place are pretty much spot on.  Loved this little romantic spot.\n\nWe started off with some lapin \u00e0 la moutarde in kale, which was a surprising combination that worked well.  Quite tasty.\n\nI went with the Coq Au Vin, while she went for the scallops in ink risotto.\n\nWe also had a couple of glasses of the burgundy pinot.\n\nFinishing things off, we had the tarte tatin along another glass of red, but of the recommended Malbec.\n\nEVERYTHING was excellent.  Seasoning was optimal and everything came in hot (not lukewarm.)\n\nService was a definite highlight.  As in VERY GOOD.  Pleasant demeanor and not once were we rushed.  In a town that is all about turning over tables ... it was very refreshing to feel like ... back in France actually where you'll have the table for the evening if you want.\n\nAll in ... we came out ahead I'd say for around $115 + tip.  I gave a pretty good tip considering the unusually strong service.\n\nSo I actually highly recommend Cocotte, given the overall quality and experience.\n\nNo real negatives really.  If anything, maybe the decor is just ok, but I thought it was appropriate for a bistro like setting.", "author": "Patrick K."}

They sat the 2 of us underneath the stairwell, which they painted dark brown and boarded off on three sides. The table faces to the kitchen so we felt secluded and unable to see what else is going on or see any sunlight.  A bit strange since there were about 15 open tables.  We requested to be moved and they so graciously moved us one table over just out from underneath the stairwell, but still felt secluded.  (Their dining room did not fill up and they had about 7 open tables when we left so I doubt they had other reservations for the other tables that would prohibit them from seating us elsewhere).  Servers were friendly and attentive.\n\nThe food,  I loved the rabbit app.  My friend enjoyed his lobster salad.  For entree, I had the beef wellington with bone marrow..This was my first time having bone marrow.  It seemed to lack flavor and had a thick layer of salt on it.  The beef wellington did not have much flavor either, a bit bland.  The puff pastry was burned in places.  I asked for it medium rare but arrived more on the med well side.  \n\nI liked the area the restaurant was located but there is NO PARKING.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-11", "description": "I'll never understand a service business that doesn't do everything it can to make customers feel comfortable, welcome and valued.  Here's a tip for the management at Cocoette: pushing four 2-top tables together does NOT create a table for 10.  \n\nOur group of 10 made a reservation at Cocoette weeks in advance.  We arrived spot-on-time for our 7:30 reservation and stood outside waiting for our table until 7:50.  When we were finally seated, our table had been created by pushing together four little rectangular tables for two.  For the benefit of Cocoette manegement, I'll help with the math at this point.  4 x 2 = 8.  Had we been a group of 4 adults, 4 children and 2 pygmy marmosets, this arrangement would have been great.  We were, however, a group of 10, full-grown adults.\n\nI alerted the manager to the problem and he came up with a brilliant solution.  He had the waiter rotate each table 90-degrees.  This had several effects:\n\n1) The overall table length was improved by about 2 feet (again, adequate space for a pygmy marmoset, but we left ours at home and brought friends instead).\n2) All of the plates, glasses, silverware, etc were relocated as the tables were rotated.  No, no, don't bother moving things back to where they belong . . . we'll do that ourselves.\n3) The WIDTH of the table was now extra-skinny and there was no room between my wine glass and the one accross the table.\n4)  If you weren't one of the lucky 4 people sitting at the end of the table, you had the unparalelled pleasure of eating dinner with your plate sitting on the seam between two tables.\n\nIn short (too late for that I suppose), when I make a reservation for 10, I expect a table for 10.  Cocoette provided a table for 8, and it detracted from our comfort and thus our enjoyment of the meal.\n\nOh, and the food?  Adequate at best.  It wasn't bad; just unremarkable.  You have effectively unlimited choices on where to dine in San Francisco.  I recommend you choose elsewhere.", "author": "Glen L."}

The service was terrible and the food was mediocre.  We were the first customers to arrive when they opened for dinner, there were 4 of us and waiting on 1 more to arrive.  We got seated and offered something to drink while waiting for our other friend to arrive. The waiter kept approaching us to ask about what we wanted to drink after we said \"just water for now\". Then started pushing if we wanted to get some appetizer. We ordered the dine about town and an extra appetizer so he'll go away.  Soon after that our friend came and our meal started to come.  In the middle of dinner, they switched our plates for clean ones since we were all sharing the food.  Which was a nice gesture, all but one friend.  When she requested/asked why she didn't get a clean plate the waiter replied, \"because you got the scallops...\" Wait..what? You should have seen our faces in disbelief.  So she demanded for one and he brought one over. We weren't even done with our food when the waiter kept coming back to our table to ask if we were done with the dishes.  Ummmm... no!  We still have food in there!! So towards the end of our dinner we had some leftovers and we asked the waiter to put what was left in \"to go\" containers.  The waiter brings the food back in which seems to be a used or old plastic container.  When we asked the [manager/owner?] if we can get another container because 1. the top of the container didn't close all the way and 2. it looked like a used container.  He told us \"this is the only one we have\" then walked off.  I guess no one else for the rest of the evening is going to get a \"to go\" container because \"there's no other ones left\"?\n\nAnyway, this restaurant was a total joke for what we paid for.  And on top of everything we experienced the waiter had the ordeal to add 18% on top of our bill.  We did not have a party of 6...!  There were only the 5 of us.... maybe he needs to go back to school to learn how to count.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS people....!!!", "author": "Alice D."}

They recently re-opened after completing a charming renovation to their restaurant on Hyde St between Jackson & Pacific. I have been unable to dine in-house yet, but we recently had a fabulous take-out dinner of their new 'signature' rotisserie chicken dish- and it was fantastic.  A whole chicken roasted with delicious seasonings and accompanied with 3 flavorful sauces.  Additionally, they feature a number of side dishes for $5 each- most are various styles of potatoes, and vegetables.  The sides are small enough (and inexpensive enough) that you should order a sampling of at least 3-4 with a whole chicken (for a dinner for 2-3 people) so that you can experience a few different flavors.

My partner and I stopped in early as we had no reservation (and it is Saturday)....1st day open for Cocotte. The food was quite good. The marrow/egg appetizer was exceptional. GET THIS! I WILL DREAM ABOUT THAT MARROW.  Even the basic butter lettuce salad was good. Scallops on the squid ink were delicious. Coq a vin was tasty- only negative is that the potatoes were noticeably undercooked. Dessert was profiteroles, which were made with rum/raisin ice cream.....good modification. Would have liked more chocolate sauce on the profiteroles, but otherwise it was great. Lastly, 3 things- 1) Nice Big Pour on the drinks. MUCH APPRECIATED 2)Attentive A+ service  3)Get an espresso machine. We'll be back! Thank you for a great Saturday night. Congrats!", "author": "Pam D."}

I decided to give it a shot and incredibly glad that I did! Absolutely everything we ordered was fabulous- I had the rainbow trout with mussels, my party also had the lasagna, the chicken and the wellington. We could not get enough of each other and our own dishes so we ended up sharing everything. It was fabulous! I wish we had had room for dessert! It's small inside but very charming.

We made a reservation after reviewing Yelp reviews and watching Check Please. Unfortunately, the minute we walked in we were disappointed and should have left. We stood in the doorway for what seemed a very long time until someone approached us. He took us to a table right in the doorway of the kitchen. When I asked him if we could have another table, he said \"No. Do you want tap or bottled water?\" We could hardly hear each other since the Latin music (in a French restaurant?) was blasting and we left our coats on since it was so cold for most of the night. I think because of the attitude of the host and our waiter, it ruined our dining experience and we thought the food was unmemorable. We won't be returning.", "author": "Dolores G."}

Host seated us and spoke very good French and English. Turned out our host was also our waiter, who happened to be very respectful, polite, and very eager for our visit. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, and knew how to address any of our questions appropriately. I first ordered the house espresso and the miss ordered a glass of French wine, both were outrageously delicious. The miss ordered a Rabbit pasta, which I have to say was very very good; it did not have the 'gamey' texture. I had the beef wellington with a complementary seasoned marrow next to the wellington; both were off the charts. I ordered a goat cheese gratin on the side which was a perfect choice to pick on the side. It's somewhat of an open kitchen. The chef cooks/prepares his dishes in an orientation where he is able to see his restaurant and watch his customers's amazing reaction to his food that is just extraordinary. Expect a heavy bill, but don't let the numbers intimidate you! This is one of those places that you have to visit once in your life. I wish I could give 6 stars to this gem in the wall.\n\nThis place is called Cocotte, known for their side dishes. Please come here with any type of expectations. I assure you that they will be met, if not exceeded. I plan to come here again next year with my now fiancee, of whom I proposed to later that night in the restaurant after I took the bill. Cocotte, thank you for the exemplary service and authentic French cuisine, we will be back!", "author": "Ryan R."}

NOW, it has been remodeled (same great chef) with more of a rustic-modern feel, and the restaurant itself looks great.. The feeling you get when you walk in there is much more appealing than before.. \n\nAs for the food and service--this is where the 5 stars come in. I decided to try a lobster arugula salad they had as a special that night which was very tasty and not too pricy, and then I had the beef tartar. I had the beef tartar there once before and it wasn't that great, but I noticed that they had it with a quail's egg this time (instead of a regular egg) so I wanted to see if the makeover of Hyde street Bistro to Cocotte was also in the new recipes or just the restaurant itself too. The beef tartar was exquisite! It was already mixed with the spices that are normally served on the side, and I thought they did a perfect job on it. I hope that they don't change the beef tartar! It was really, really delicious. I also had a couple of glasses of wine, the white I think was a pinot blanc, which was pretty good, and the red, was perfect. It was a Syrah, I think, from Oregon. The red wine was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. Although, I did end up leaving there with two apps, two glasses of wine, and a dessert for about $50.00 (not including tip), so, it is definitely a splurge for me, not an every day thing (although if they had a slightly larger selection of cheaper wine I might be there every week!).\n\nNow, I know that the chef (and I think owner as well?) is the same, and he has shined with his exceptional taste and knowledge in french food, but I have to give credit where it is due to the wait staff as well. The cheery Host at the door with a helpful and kind demeanor greeted me with a big \"Bon soir\" and sat me at the (new and improved) bar. And my server/bartender Phillipe exceeded my expectations as a server. He was knowledgeable, patient, and extremely friendly but let me enjoy my meal as well, and made my dinner so pleasant! Really, he made the whole experience so much better! I have had him as my server once before when it was H.S.B. and he has always been absolutely perfect. I am so happy that they re-did the place and I can't wait to come back for the mussels, and to try one of their delicious looking main dishes as well! Good job to whoever designed the place! It was definitely a good move. Even the bathroom looks better!\n\n\nI will be back soon!\nBon Apetit!", "author": "Thea G."}

The following was our evening: 1- although informed when booking, the restaurant did not even say congratulations (much less offer anything), 2- food came we had not ordered. We had great trouble flagging down a waiter to have it removed and given to the right table before it got cold, 3- several dishes we did order were tepid and had to be rewarmed, 4- one of us was served the rotisserie chicken 15 minutes after everyone else was served and half way through their meals- no explanation, no apology,  5- the duck confit entree was so tough it was inedible, and finally, 6- we were never asked if we wanted something else, told that the problem was we did not have a sharp enough knife, and that we were the first customers to ever complain about the confit. To top it off- we were told we ate too much to not charge us.... (I promise on my father's grave, we had 2 bites, one for my husband to initially taste and one for me to confirm his problem!!!!!!  I still haven't figured out how we could decide it was poorly done with out trying it). I then shared my meal with my husband- both of us, of course, left hungry. The waiter  threatened to quit his job if the duck confit was removed from the bill!

There is one cool table in this little alcove area, we were sat right next to this one, and because of the design, their conversation was amplified, but still wasn't too distracting.\n\nService was a mixed bag -- the waiter was great, very friendly, French and initially it was off to a good start, but it was nearly impossible to get his attention throughout our meal and he never came back to check on our drinks. Even when he would come to grab something off the table when clearly, we could barely catch him to point out empty wine glasses and request another glass. Same thing with the water. We sat with empty glasses for a while before finally flagging him down and asking for another bottle. He just wasn't very attentive and they're probably missing out on additional drink orders.\n\nAs far as the food, we split the frisee salad with quail eggs and pork belly. This was delicious -- a lot of pork belly, though I would've prefered the eggs closer to poached than hard-boiled like they were. The bread they serve is really good. For the main, my husband got the rotisserie chicken with a side of poatoes and I got the duck confit with lentils and a side of cauliflower gratin. We both agreed that salad was the best thing we had, but our mains were solid. My confit could have had crispier skin, but the meat was still tender which doesn't always happen. The lentils were a nice compliment and the cauliflower was good, but probably wouldn't go for it again. My husband enjoyed his chicken.\n\nWe ordered the chocolate lava cake for dessert and while we finished the whole thing, I wouldn't exactly call it a lava cake -- even when you got to the center, nothing oozed out. I guess it was a little over-cooked. It wasn't bad, but not as indulgent as we were expecting and definitely didn't live up to the name.\n\nI think this is a nice choice, but they could improve upon their overall service of checking on you throughout your meal.", "author": "Lauren M."}

I was not expecting this at all and thought it was above and beyond what they needed to do. \n\nIn summary, I will be returning to cocotte and recommending it to my friends :)", "author": "Priscilla L."}

I do not recommend going here with a group, or really at all. We brought three bottles of wine to enjoy and they would only let us open one ($20 corkage fee). We were not planning on going home after dinner so we had to lug around bottles of wine all night. They completely neglected our table, knowing that they were just going to slap gratuity on our bill at the end. 2 stars because the food and the ambience were ok, but I will not go back to a restaurant that treated our group the way Cocotte treated us. Go to Seven Hills or Frascati down the street. There you will find top notch food, great ambience and wonderful service.", "author": "Alison S."}

To illustrate how much I love this dish: One time , My husband and I made dinner plans and Of course I planned to order the chicken because duh, it's my favorite. I was looking forward to it the whole afternoon. But then when we got there, they were all out!! I was so disappointed and just felt deflated and I just stared quietly at my plate for a couple of minutes. Seriously. Then I ordered my second favorite dish from this place, which is the sea bass. It's really good, but it can't take place of the chicken.  Sigh.", "author": "Paula U."}

I went there with a friend last weekend to celebrate a birthday.  Parking is a huge issue because it's in a neighborhood.  I called the restaurant to let them know that I couldn't find parking and the front desk gentleman was not friendly and reiterated that they were in a neighborhood (duh?) and said to go down to a wine shop and park for $10, which we did.  Very crowded and loud in a very small restaurant.  The wait staff were very accommodating and food was mixed review.  The mussels were fantastic and the Coq au Vin, however the duck confit was very greasy.  I would only recommend if you lived in the area or took public transportation.", "author": "Trudee H."}

If you see B.N.'s review, I don't need to say anymore- Everything was fantastic, including the service and the view into an open kitchen where the chef's were completely in tune, no fuss or problems with a totally packed restaurant.  Just beware, you are only allowed one bottle of wine per group, no matter if you have 2 people or 10.

The atmosphere fun and upbeat (yes, a little noisy) but it was all around a good meal and the service was far better than I expected. An attentive waiter and the \"cocotte\" dish of the evening, a squash, was spectacular. The roast chicken was very good, the lamb was just ok, but that means it still was good just nothing special. I highly recommend this place (I never give out 5 stars unless it is way over the top) and I so appreciate good cooking at reasonable prices.", "author": "Violet R."}

Then, we were informed that as an \"I'm sorry\" gesture we wouldn't be charged for the two meals that were never brought out to us. Truly despicable and shameful customer service.

The new menu has a few old favorites and some great new additions, including whole and half chicken that you can see slow roasting in kitchen.   You can see the French Chef hard at work in the kitchen from you table which makes things cosy and give the restaurant an artisanal feel.  The service was impeccable and the addition of a bar is awesome. Will definitely go back:)", "author": "Sean G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-19", "description": "My one-star rating doesn't have anything to do with the food at this place.  Unfortunately, we never made it that far.  Had a reservation yesterday for 9:00pm.  Showed up on time, and was told that there were no tables available, so there would be a \"short wait.\"  When asked how long, they told us about 15 minutes.  We waited.... and waited... and waited...   40 minutes later, the host/server/bartender  guy came out and told us there were still no tables.  And that he had no idea when anything would be opening up.  By this point in time, I'm starving and starting to get annoyed.  The host was pretty apologetic, and invited us to come have a seat at the bar.  He offered to pour us a couple of glasses of wine while we continued to wait.  So finally, 45 minutes after my reservation time, we went inside to discover there were two spots open at the bar -- but only ONE chair.  We stood there for a while, waiting for someone to take our drink orders, and no one ever did.  Finally, we flagged a passing server to ask for another bar stool, and she replied with a shrug, said they didn't have any more, and walked off.  That was the final straw.  We left.\n\nMaybe their food is good... and the ambiance seemed nice enough.  BUT COME ON!  They need to learn to manage their reservations better.  Any place with service this bad doesn't deserve my business.", "author": "Chrissy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-04", "description": "Came here with a small group of friends on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not crowded.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Food was delicious and nicely presented.  We ordered the chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 as our appetizer, sea bass, roasted quail and roasted duck breast as our entrees.  The chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 accompanied with toasty bread and red onions with marsala jam was a pretty good substitute for the foie gras that is now banned in CA.  The quail was served in a cute little cast iron pan which well preserved the heat of the meat and kept the skin of the quail crisp with a delicious and not too heavy chanterelles mushroom and grapes stuffings.  The sea bass was grilled to the right texture, slightly crisp on the outside, moist in the center.  The typical oily consistency of the sea bass was not presented, the flavor was excellent.  Didn't try the roasted duck myself but from my friends' comments, it was well prepared and tasteful.  We also ordered their profiterolles (rhums and raisins ice cream on puffy pastry...  yum yum!!) and chocolate cake fondant (moist and flavorful) to finish our meal with a sweet and satisfying touch.  Price was reasonable and will definitely come back to try out some more of their dishes.", "author": "Ceci L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-09-18", "description": "Second visit to this somewhat trendy neighborhood restaurant., confirming there are better choices in Nob Hill. The food was good, not great and pricey especially for a restaurant featuring and open kitchen with line cooks and no chef. The service is where Cocotte really falls down. The wait at an uncrowded bar was over 10 minutes without being offered a drink; that would have been a good cue to leave and go elsewhere. When the meal was served the appetizer took 20 minutes to come and was presented in a very hot dish without a word, resulting in a minor burn through accidental contact with an arm. The entree was so slow that the desert order was requested not by one but by three different people before the entree came. The entree was clearly forgotten because after 50 minutes when asked again it appeared 10 minutes later. The manager // owner seemed to be aware of the problems and offered a weak apology. The check totaled just under $60 pp with tip, including a glass of wine and appetizer and entree and no desert. There are many other great choices in Nob Hill such as the Nob Hill Cafe offer much better value and service.", "author": "Abe S."}

Some of the most authentic french food in the city- much better than all of the ones in the FiDi. We sat next to a group of about 10 French people last time if that's any indication. Everything I've had is delicious- $7 chicken liver parfait- I mean you can get bad spring rolls for that price. They let us stay well after closing time one night- even suggesting dessert  when i'm sure they all wanted to call it a night.", "author": "Maggie E."}

The Beef Wellington was great, as was the Coq a Vin, and the Rabbit with pasta.  The salads, including the lobster salad were wonderful.  The Banana Cr\u00e8me Brulee was to die for, and the Tart Tatin  was perfect, and the Profiteroles were great also.  The restaurant was small which made it a great atmosphere, and we loved the atmosphere of the neighborhood with the trees and the cable car line.  The service was very good--we had no complaints about the speed of the service, and our waiter was very very friendly.  We want to return to try the chicken, which looked and smelled wonderful.  The only complaints were that we had to ask for new wine glasses when we changed wines, and we were not given new silverware with each new course, but other than that LOVED the place, and can't wait to return.  We highly recommend it.  We are big fans of this new find.", "author": "David M."}

What a gem! The wine and food are well-priced (especially for the area) and yummy. I would recommend the coq au vin, the rotisserie chicken with potato and goat cheese gratin, and the apple tart for dessert.
