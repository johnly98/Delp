We both order our plates individually, we didn't have in mind a family style, but they served his dish and mine together on the same plate. \n2. Ethiopian places I've been to in the past usually served the main dish over the bread, and with with 1-2 side dishes included . The meat dish at $16 just came with bread. \n3. The food was cold, but the flavor was there. \n\nWill continue to walk the xtra half mile to a different place further down for my business that costs 4-6 dollars LESS and that provides a well rounded meal.

Both were a little greasy and spicy (#2 was spicier), but I liked #5 more. It seemed to have more chunks of meat while #2 was saucier and more single-noted in flavor. \n\nThe veg platter (choose for 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 people) had a sample of all 5 of their vegetarian dishes.

The mushrooms were okay in terms of flavor (spicy and a little acidic) but also pretty greasy. Chickpeas, one of the only non spicy dishes, was a good counter though otherwise nothing extraordinary.\n\nAll in all, the food was solid and pretty good.

I like that the food is spicy and you don't have to use those silly utensils called forks and knives to eat. Sometimes we have to recognize that they get in the way of really getting down and personal with your food. \n\nWe ordered a huge platter of 2 or 3 different kinds of meat entrees. The portions were very generous even to my out-of-control American portion expectations. My only problem is the flatbread that goes with the dishes. I think it's just a personal bias against sourdough. I would've much rather eat it with plain flour dough. Somehow I thought the sourdough was too overpowering and it disrupted the flavors from the entree, especially in the spongey form of that flatbread. \n\nThe service was pretty fast because we went around 5PM and not a lot of people were there yet. It's kind of a go up to the counter, then mind your business and eat style, not really the fancy restaurant that you're constantly waited upon. I kind of like the non-hovering service because it's more casual (you feel less guilty for eating food with your fingers), you pay a great price for the amount of food you get, and you can enjoy the time spent with great company without constantly going, \"yes yes food is great. thanks.\"", "author": "Jen Y."}

We were looking to try someplace where neither one of us had been, so this seemed perfect.\n\nWe walked into a fairly small, casual looking restaurant where our waiter greeted us right away and offered us menus.  We decided on the vegetarian platter for two that had five different options on it including chickpeas, lentils, mushrooms, potatoes with cabbage and salad.  We asked our waiter if we could also have a chicken dish, to which he replied, \"No.  We don't do that.\"  Um, okay.  \n\nWhen our food arrived, my friend asked for a spoon because he didn't want to eat so much of the the injera.  Our waiter's condescending response was, \"it's finger food,\" but reluctantly brought him a spoon anyway, stating, \"I hope this is okay, it's a tea spoon.\"  Again...um, okay.  \n\nThe platter was awfully small for $17, and we gobbled it up quickly.  But not before our waiter asked us about halfway through our meal if we \"knew what everything was,\" and did we \"know what we were eating.\"  Seriously?!?!  Now, I should mention that I don't think that he was being rude, condescending and disrespectful on purpose.  I think he was just a very \"young\" 18 year-old guy, who wasn't very worldly and didn't know any better.  But I digress...back to the food...\n\nSpeaking from experience, the same platter in NYC is nearly twice the size for the same price and much tastier.  The platter we had should have been an appetizer for half the price.  My friend made a comment that I thought was a good point...for that price and those food choices, it should have been \"all you can eat.\"  I could ALMOST dismiss those things had the food blown my socks off.  But, unfortunately, it didn't do much to my socks or my taste buds.  It wasn't bad, it was just... unforgettable.  \n\nSo, $17 (plus tip) later as we were walking out the door, my friend turned to me and asked, \"so, where do you want to go now for dinner?\"", "author": "Erin W."}

We got the vegetarian platter for two which I was really excited about, and it came with the two servings of Injera. \n\nNote on the veggie platter: it's a great deal. When they brought it out, I didn't think it would be enough food, especially because I have a big appetite plus I was with a dude, but it definitely was. NOTE: injera expands in your stomach. If you eat until you feel really full, you'll want to vomit about fifteen minutes later, guaranteed. Eat slowly here. :)\n\nThe food was good! The lentil and mushroom dishes were by FAR the best in my opinion. The spinach was my least favorite. The lentil and mushroom have a really nice spice, whereas the potato and chickpea dishes are a little blander. Good, but given the choice, I'd rather have double portions of my favorites.\n\nThe salad is tiny and nothing too exciting.\n\nOverall, good food.

Dress casual, and bring your appetite and a good attitude. If you've never eaten Ethiopian food before, be aware that it's served communally (everything on one large platter), and you will be eating with your hands by scooping up bite-fulls of saucy food with Injera, a spongy Ethiopian flat bread. Think the taste of sourdough and the texture of a very airy, spongy crepe.  \n\nWe had the Tibse lamb and the vegetarian sampler platter for two: Alicha , Alicha Atar, Hamli, Kintishara, and Tumtumo. The platter came with 2 servings of Injera, plus the server brought an extra dish of Injera (nice!). The lamb was slightly gamy, but it didn't detract from the flavor at all. Deliciously spiced. The five vegetarian items were all tasty...each had a different main ingredient: potatoes, chickpeas, spinach, mushrooms, and lentils, respectively. \n\nOther Yelpers mentioned the dishes were spicy. I thought items were nicely spiced, with a little bit of heat, but certainly not \"spicy.\" Of course, I order \"Thai spicy\" heat at the local Thai restaurant, so you can draw your own conclusions as to the degree of fireproofing on my tastebuds. \n\nSomeone described the beer as \"Ethiopian Budweiser.\" I think that's pretty accurate. \n\nWonderful meal.

Visited Lower Haight to check out another Ethiopian cafe which had sadly shutdown, so we were overjoyed to find out there was another one in Upper Haight with relatively decent Yelp reviews. Bah humbug I say, this lead me to believe the food was good (yes folks, another Yelp fairy died as a result of this finding). \n\nThe cafe was pretty busy - busy enough to keep the staff moving around. We ordered - vegetarian for me, meat for my two companions. Happily offered and served on two separate plates so no cross meat contamination. However, the food was lukewarm bordering on cold, and who likes cold injera? We hadn't waited super long, but the food clearly had seen better days. Spinach was over spicy and unpleasant, chickpea puree was decent but overall, the whole meal was absent on the enjoyment factor. The boys didn't enjoy their meat dishes either.

Sad because I don't think it's about the food but about the about service (the lack of). \n\nLet's start off with the food. I've never tried Ethiopian food, so it was time to explore! My friend tried the honey wine (Tej) and as implied, it was as sweet as honey. Too much of this stuff and it is guaranteed that you will be driving the porcelain truck. I had a light beer, Meta Beer Export Lager from Ethiopia, and we were excited to start gorging. It was downhill from here. \n\nBeing a neophyte at Eastern African cuisine, I naturally needed help. The waitress was a bit short on describing anything Ethiopian for us. OK, let this one go, maybe she was just having a bad night. \n\nWe went ahead and ordered the three veggie combo and a Tibsie lamb. The veggies and Tibsie lamb were served on a sour-doe like bread. In our case we'd ordered the alecha, hindi, kimitishira with our meat dish. \n\nNow, you eat with your fingers. Ethiopian food is spicy,this spiciness is offset by tearing a piece of the porous sour doe like bread (Injera or Ethiopian crepe, flat bread) with sponge-like texture and scooping up one of your entrees with your right hand; this is followed by a swig of your beer (that's us). Note the word \"porous\", it means you need to wash your hands after or you need plenty of Wet Ones to wipe down. At this point, I'm getting full from sponge-like absorption properties of the flat bread. I could feel every oz. of my Meta Beer being sucked up by this bread. The waitress does not come by to see how we are doing. \n\nWe're getting weird vibes at this point, not from the meal and but from the aloof, OK I'll say it, rude service. \n\nThe Tibsie lamb was a bit gamy for me. It was spicy, the meat was tender, and the \"handful\" combinations of peppers, garlic and other ingredients squished evenly in my mouth. The kimitishira is a mushroom dish that is so finely chopped that it almost looked Tumtumo or lentil-like texture. The alecha had lots of tasty chunkie potatoes, tomatoes and carrots. I liked the hindi, which is a semi-puree spinach veggie dish--yum. All in all, Ethiopian food is an acquired taste for me. \n\nI do not finish, and it's time to meet up with darth vader. \"We don't take credit cards\", and walks away. I'm sure the Yelpers who rated this place as 4 stars must have had someone else working. \n\nI would have given this place 2.5 stars, and I may have come back to get used to the cuisine, but because of the cold service (as cold as the January San Francisco temperature outside), I give it a *.", "author": "Reyz A."}

I was also excited because although I had seen Axum many times while walking by on Haight Street, I had forgotten or ignored the fact that it was Ethiopian.  Club Waziema is much closer to where I live, but there are times I don't want to eat in a bar, even if it's a bar/restaurant.\n\nAxum's food is good, definitely four stars.  But the service is so so, and I was disappointed by the atmosphere.  Now, I've been to many an Ethiopian place with a drop ceiling, and I've still enjoyed the atmosphere.  But we were here in the middle of the day, and besides the funny scenes on the lampshades, I really didn't like being in here.  Maybe it was the cases of Coke stacked up near our table, but I just felt like I was in someone's basement, and there wasn't even a pool table with ripped felt or an old collection of 45s in the corner.\n\nI'd definitely come back for the food, but then I'd rather do takeout, and since Waziema is less than a block from where I live, why would I walk all the way to the Lower Haight?", "author": "John S."}

The only way to go about eating here is to grab a vegetarian platter (to serve the number of people you're with) and to throw in a couple of meat dishes.\n\n\n The vegetarian platter is an incredibly tasty choice and consists of a number of different sauteed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, cabbage, jalapenos, spinach, tomatoes, garlic), fungi dips (mushrooms), and pureed beans (chickpeas, lentils). The different choices are all perfectly seasoned (with cumin, garlic, salt, pepper, chili, etc). It's all served on a huge plate and everyone is given a crepe-like bread. That and your hands are the only utensils you get.

In this corner of the ring we have Upper Haight's Massawa and in the other corner, we have Lower Haight's Axum Cafe. \n\n(insert theme music from Rocky here).\n\nFirst of all, I have to admit that Axum Cafe cured me of my dislike for Injera bread.  It turns out that Massawa's bread was just overly sour for my delicate taste buds.  However, I'd have to say that Massawa's dishes had a bit more complexity of flavor when compared to Axum.  My lamb dish at Massawa had carrots, potatoes, and bell peppers and the chicken there was oh-so savory.  The flavors of the chicken/lamb/vegetarian dishes at Axum were good but unfortunately they were a bit flat, as they lacked spices and pizazz (for lack of a better term).  \n\nOnce again, Ethiopian dining appeals to me because I think the fact that the food is served in a communal/ family style fashion is endearing and it also makes the restaurant a good option for group dinners.  The prices at Axum are relatively cheap, since dinner and \"honey\" wine for our party of 5 only came to $80 with tax. Also the servers were personable and even came to sit and talk with us during our dinner. \n\nSo.  If you're wondering who won the Ethiopian restaurant battle, I'd have to say it's a toss up between the two places.   If good Injera is important to you, go to Axum, but if you're looking for more savory dishes, I would go to Massawa.  Next stop for me:  Club Waziema", "author": "LaSha G."}

I'm a devoted meat eater (see Patio Filipino review http://www.yelp.com/biz/patio-filipino-san-bruno#hrid:6csWX5celvJZ9umxf54EJw) but I didn't miss the meat in the least.  How does a handful of garbanzos and lentils fill a person up so much?  They don't really but the skin-like bread sure did.  It started to expand before it reached my stomach and stayed there for days, like chewing gum stuck to the insides of your intestines.  \n\nThe only thing I didn't like about this meal was the lack of utensils.  I've never thought of myself as a princess before but if not wanting to eat with my fingers makes me a princess, then I am.  Yes, I'm slightly embarrassed of that fact but I'm a person not an animal.  I know others love pretending to be wild and forsaking all utensils but I could pass on that.  I've found other places than restaurants to be primitive.  *wink wink*  Next time I'm bringing at least a spork.", "author": "Shelley H."}

Ideal for a group is the combo allowing you to sample all five vegetarian entrees - including spicy mushrooms simmered with tomatoes, onions, and garlic, spinach and jalapenos, and chickpeas pureed with onions - for only $32.00.

Good food, perfectly aged injera, the driest Tej.  The first time the food was good but could've been more flavorful, so the second we asked for everything to be spicy, which brought out much richer flavors.\n\nBeware that the portions are huge, so skip lunch if you want to finish.  The Tej honey wine clears the palate without guzzling, so there's less liquid to absorb into the injera once they're all chatting in your gut.\n\nThe service can be perfunctory, but that's as much a part of Ethiopian restaurants as the inexpensive prices.\n\nSo, if you're willing to starve yourself to finish, enjoy high spice, limited hydration, and ignore service lapses, then it's a fabulous place.  It's expectation management, but it's no different than other Ethiopian places in the negative ways, and better than most for the food, so five stars.", "author": "Don T."}

The only sample I did not partake of was the lettuce - despite what certain arties alleged, I was not averse to eating it, I merely could not figure out how.

The restaurant is \"family style\" which is nice and while the decor was plain, it was acceptable given the prices on the menu.\n\nFood wise we ordered the vegetarian platter for six which had five different entrees and a salad.  Definitely plenty of food but of the five entrees, only two were really enjoyable: the chickpea and lentil purees.  The mushrooms were over spiced, making it difficult to eat, and the spinach and potato-cabbage entrees were tasteless and under seasoned.\n\nMinus one star for the stomach pains I've had since eating the meal.  While I laughed earlier at the reviews on Yelp mentioning \"the shits,\" it's unfortunately true.  This, however, may just be due to the unusual spices they use and shouldn't cloud your judgement.  But I am happy that I decided not to order meat...\n\nMinus another star for attempting to get us to order two, three person platters when we asked for one, six person platter.  The waitress suggested that it would be easier for us to handle but I'm sure it was only done to try and get us to buy two $25 platters instead of one $45 one.\n\nFinally, minus another star for a billing problem.  We decided to split the bill on two cards but checking our statements, there's a charge for half the meal (plus tip) as well as a full charge for the meal.  In all the hundreds of times I've gone out to eat, this is the first time I've had such a thing happen.\n\nI'd give the place a try if only for the unusual method of eating (with your hands) but definitely pay by cash and be sure to pack a roll of Tums with you.", "author": "A K."}

The Injera is pretty decent, though a little bland, portion sizes are generous, the price is right (though slightly less generous and slightly more expensive than comparable places in the East Bay, effing San Francisco!)  The spices are kind of bland, too, and it's all good but not wow or packed with flavor.\n\nIf you're not already close by and would need to make a trek to get here, you might as well hop on the BART to the East Bay and get some truly epic Ethiopian food over there.

I'll be back because it's close and when I'm craving Ethiopian it will at least hit the spot.   \n\nAll in all, good and satisfying but underwhelming if you really love Ethiopian food.\n\nOne thing I'll add is that in contrast to other people, I thought the service was fine.  They were packed on a Thursday night when I was there, but they were really accommodating.  I love friendly service and getting (figurative) hand jobs from servers at nice restaurants as much as the next guy, but I think friendly can also mean trying to make everything work for all your customers and they are definitely fine in that regard.

While it is not unpleasant, it did add another element to the meal which I did not enjoy. It was also thinner than what I had recall, but actually prefer a thinner injera.\n\nThe sampler came with a green salad, topped with traditional Ethiopian dressing that taste surprisingly like pesto, a mushroom dish, a chickpea dish, a lentil dish and a cabbage/potato dish.\n\nThe mushroom dish was by far my favorite. The mushrooms are meaty, and seasoned just right. The chickpea and lentil dishes are pureed and quite mild in taste and spices. I personally would prefer more agressive spicing on these 2 dishes. The cabbage/potato dish is also fairly mild, but the carrots are especially tasty after the simmering. I prefer my potatoes and carrots cooked a little longer, but that may not be the Ethiopian style.\n\nNone of the items had a distinctive taste that would strongly suggest the food is of Ethiopian origins.

I was already having trouble distinguishing the pureed food assortments when Jocie commented on the striking similarity of injera to that of wet, soggy ace bandages. After hearing that, I could no longer eat with my hands, scooping the food. When I asked for silverware, the waitress looked at me like a deer in headlights. \n\nFriday evening rolls around; that means dining club. It's Jen's turn to pick the place. Becky, Rebecca and I wait all day long in anticipation to figure out what we'll be having from that evenings' menu.  Finally, its decided we're going to Axum Cafe. My very first though, \"Ace Bandages\". Needless to say, anticipation turned to anguish.    When I first walked in, the set up reminded me of a few cafes/restaurants I've been to in the Abacos. The barred windows and door hanging on by probably some rope,  Axum is a seat yourself, chill kind of environment.  The food was better and they carry silverware; ok, maybe only forks.", "author": "Casie C."}

I think I could have spent hours eating their veggie combo platter. It was cheap and delicious, which made the slow service more than tolerable. However, my last three visits to Axum have proven a great disappointment to me. The food has been flavorless (and that's all veggie entrees), the lentils runny, and what used to be a lovely homemade basily-minty salad dressing has been replaced with something that can best be described as wishbone-wannabe.\n\nThe other thing is that it seems the entire staff has changed. For as long as I've been going to Axum (which is about 10 years -- I believe I first ate there in 1997!), the staff has been the same. This year (2007), I haven't seen those familiar faces, so I wonder if the \"good\" staff moved to the other location or just sold the business.", "author": "Carla B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-31", "description": "My main memory of Axum is the super speedy service: we walked in, were shown a table, given menus, ordered, got the drinks, got the food (veggie platter for 2), all in less than 5 minutes, max. I didn't exactly feel rushed, and the service was pleasant though not exactly friendly, but I dunno, I guess I like it if a restaurant at least pretends that it's preparing the food fresh for you by letting you wait a bit...I also would have liked if they'd given wipes or wet towels or something to wash your hands with before the meal like some places do, considering that you eat the food with your hands off of a communal plate. But, it's a cheap restaurant, so whatever. There's a bathroom, it's good enough.\n\nThe injera was quite nice, not too pungent (maybe it's toned down for a Western palate, but that's how I like it). The potato dish was fine as well, similar to an Indian curry. The other vegetable dishes were good and spiced nicely, but on a whole a bit too oily and wet for my taste--less of the oily sauce would be healthier, fresher tasting, and not leave me this weighed down, heavy, slightly sick of Ethiopian food feeling. The worst was the spinach dish: the spinach was canned, horribly overcooked, and had a bit of an off flavor. I've been to a few African restaurants recently, and they all seem to have a fresh-spinach-phobia, but Axum's spinach....damnnn...even popeye wouldn't eat that stuff. If you order the veggie platter, I'd recommend asking to substitute the spinach with something else (unless you want to have a greenish-black blob taking up valuable injera space).\n\nDespite those complaints, I did enjoy the experience and the food, and I'll be back. This would be a great place to take people who haven't had Ethiopian before; the flavors aren't as overpowering as at some Ethiopian places I've been to.", "author": "Sarah J."}

Ok, so maybe I should be thankful that someone was looking out for me and decided their meat was not fit for serving raw, and since I didn't spent any night wretching or curled up in pain, sweating, dizzy (hmmm, i'm having flaskbacks of Thailand), I can say I wanted that stuff raw.\n\nTo be fair, the food at Axum was good.  After finishing my injera, I proceeded to eat the piece that our dishes had been spread out on, that soaked up their spicey yummy dishes.  Unfortunately I've been spoiled.  I lived in DC for quite a while, and having the largest Ethopian population outside of Ethopia, they also have tons of great Ethopian food.  I've had so much that I've eaten until excruciating pain.

The greater the exoticism, the greater the adventure. Although one could argue that Ethiopian can no longer claim its rarity and mystique in pretentious San Francisco. Why, there's also another one just a few blocks up on the Upper Haight, and surely the Mission is replete with them. However, my much needed stop to Safeway assured my decision to dine at Axum Cafe.\n\nMy friend and I haven't had Ethiopian food and was most curious. I must admit, lacking prior knowledge, I was intimidated; ever nervous of any social function wherein I might, out of ignorance, commit a breach of manners. A self-consciousness most people (left-leaning, Liberal, wannabe-\"creative\"-types) daren't admit to, but I theorize to be a fundamental social truth. We are hierarchical animals. And although careless of its imposition on ourselves, expect a fair amount of etiquette on others -- for the sake of our appetite! Observing others' tables stealthily, I got a sense of how one lays the table where Ethiopian is served, and quite blindly, we ordered away!\n\nI was in for quite a delicious surprise! The food was fantastic! I had the Tibsie Fish, and it was absolutely scrumptious! With my indiscriminate and erudite taste-buds, I wouldn't say that the flavors were all that foreign, but that injera was just absolutely amazing.\n\nThe ambiance too made quite a modest impression. Of course one could expect motherland relics and decorations, even when it borders on the tacky, but the feel of the place was comfortable, casual and serene. People came as they are, and I've noticed, left exquisitely satiated. \n\nAxum Cafe definitely deserves several more visits to fully take in its concept. But what with my fantastic first impression, my exuberance cannot be held still. I will definitely frequent -- and highly recommend -- this place. And I am more than enthusiastic to sample other Ethiopian restaurants in the city.", "author": "Rho-p O."}

The chicken dish was good, but looking at the puddle of grease running into the center of the big communal dish was pretty disturbing.  The spinach just tasted like spinach.  Not much to it.  I don't like the pancake-type bread.  Too sour for me and doesn't compliment the food in my opinion.  I'm not sure if all Ethiopian bread tastes like that at all restaurants.  Either way, I would like to try Ethiopian again somewhere else.  I would pay a little more for better food.  I have a feeling I would really like it if I found the right spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-06", "description": "As far as I can tell, Axum represents the best of what's around for Ethiopian food in SF.  Personally I am a devotee of Merkato in LA and poor Axum can't hold a candle in terms of flavor, price or atmosphere... but it's still very good (BTW, my boyfriend maintains that I'm a huge Ethiopian food snob and Axum is great, no qualifiers).  Anyway, because I miss Merkato so much we've been on a quest to find good Ethiopian food in San Francisco and Axum is the top contender right now.  The restaurant is small but clean and friendly and the service is pleasant and competent (though sometimes be a bit slow due to being overwhelmed).  Our favorite dishes are the tsebi he derho (chicken drumsticks in sauce), which tastes a bit like what I've always associated with yedoro wat, but a little spicier and tomato-y and no eggs, and alicha ater (pureed chickpeas).  We really did not enjoy the collards or regular alicha (mostly cauliflower), but this is probably because we are little kids who won't eat our veggies at heart.  The injera is not as sour and spongy as it should be and I don't think it's made with tef (wrong color), but it's still quite good.  Sadly, they do not have Ethiopian tea, but they do have hot apple cider which makes a decent substitute.  The portions are generous and the prices are great for San Francisco.   Overall, a great place and we've become very fond of it.\n\nPS.  Axum can get a little cold (no carpet, lots of windows, jerks leave the door open) so bring a sweater!", "author": "Marie K."}

We took our good friend AFP (that's ass face patterson) to Axum with his lovely non-ass-face wife, and they denied his request for utensils...brilliant!  I saw the wave of concern run across his face, because with the AFP volume=quality equation, I think he was afraid that the hands would not prove to be sufficient shoveling tools.  It's the same logic he applies to chinese as he tosses aside the chopsticks and goes full-on fork.  It's embarrassing for all of us.  But I assure you, we all had plenty to eat (even AFP).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-13", "description": "We had dinner here on a weekend night.  A simple restaurant--they didn't have any of the woven basket type of tables (I keep forgetting to look up the word for these) at this place.\n\nWhen we first walked in, we weren't sure if it was seat yourself or what, because no one greeted us.  So, there was an empty table, which we headed toward, & someone came over with menus & wiped down the table.  So, I'm still not sure if it's seat yourself or not.  \nI had hot tea ('cuz I was kind of sick & thought it'd soothe my throat---no double dipping for me!).  One of my friends got the tej (honey wine).  I didn't try it because I didn't want to get anyone else sick, but they described it as like \"cough syrup.\"  That might have helped me!\n\nWe got tibsie lamb (select cuts of tender lamb sauted with onions, jalapeno peppers, garlic, tomatoes, and authentic Ethiopian spices)---yummy sauce, tsebi he derho (marinated chicken drumsticks simmered in tomatoes, garlic, onions and traditional spicy Ethiopian butter)---relatively easy to peel the meat off the drumstick, but not falling off the drumstick, and zighine (tender cuts of select beef sliced into cubes; marinated and simmered in tomatoes, onions, and traditional spicy Ethiopian butter).  We originally wanted the veggie combo & had picked out hamli (spinach and jalapeno peppers simmered in onions, garlic and authentic Ethiopian spices), kintishara (mushrooms diced and simmered in tomatoes, onions, garlic and authentic Ethiopian spices), & tumtumo (lentil beans pured and simmered in onions, garlic and authentic Ethiopian spices) as our 3 choices, but then I think we confused the server, because then we decided we wanted 2 veggie combos to be sure we'd have enough food.  Instead, when the food all came out on the humongous injera lined platter, we they had given us the veggie platter, which consisted of alicha (potatoes, carrots, cabbage, jalapeno peppers, garlic stewed in our authentic Ethiopian spices), alicha ater (chickpea pured with onions and authentic Ethiopian spices)---kind of bland, hamli, tumtumo, and salad.   Of course we didn't notice until we'd eaten half of it & someone exclaimed, \"where are the mushrooms?!\"  That's when we figured it out.  Oh well.  It's all good.  So, I still have yet to try mushrooms at an Ethiopian place.  We each got a big circular piece of injera folded into quarters, & they brought one extra piece for us to share, which I don't think we finished, so we didn't even have to ask for more.  The injera was not quite as spongy as others I've had, but was still just as filling.\n\nThere was one group there in the middle of the room that was quite loud.  OK, actually, I think it was mostly one guy in the group who was very loud, but maybe he was drunk.  Anyway, one of my friends made a very loud comment about it, & I was making little volume knob turning motions with my hands, so we were a little obnoxious/obvious about it (but I was not really in the mood for loud), so they actually apologized to us about being loud when they were on their way out---that was a nice gesture on their part (they didn't sound like they were being sarcastic, & they could've totally ignored us).  And it did get significantly quieter after they left.\n\nIt ended up costing us about $15 each, so not bad for a filling dinner.  We still had room for dessert, though, & had been discussing where we wanted to go towards the end of our meal.\n\nLocated on the northeast corner of Haight & Pierce.  Parking wasn't too bad, but I think we lucked out after circling around a couple times...we parked a little over a block away.", "author": "Linda T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-08", "description": "My favorites are the veggie platters and the spicy lamb dish.  Their injera is nice and tangy most of the time and compliments the spiced vegetable and meat flavors so well.   \n\nThis is really delicious comfort food at affordable prices in a BASIC and cosy environment.   With the vegetarian dishes, it might be better to go earlier than later:   All the time except once, i did takeout early in the evening.  My one foray going much later in the night had the veggie combo's usual smooth liquid consistancy to be a thick heavy paste instead, its moistness evaporated like it had sat in the pot for too long.  They need to cut their potatoes into smaller pieces to lessen the cooking time and prevent earlier orders (5:30-6:00pm) not to be undercooked and crunchy.  I find early orders to be the best quality overall so I just avoid the potato now.  This review might sound critical, but these are only minor things I'm pointing out to make the dining experience as wonderful as possible.  Axum is my staple and favorite ethiopian place for the monthly if not weekly Ethiopian cravings.  Certain meat dishes, like the lamb ones,  are always freshly cooked and piping hot per order.  \n\nParking can be really difficult at times, that's the main drawback.   \n\nFor people unfamiliar with ethiopian food:  it's to be eaten with your hands.  Unfortunately, I've seen super fastidious unadventureous diners, taken to other ethiopian restaurants (in more expensive settings)  being unable to get over the eat with the hands and no utensils concept.  \n\nIf you are familiar with Ethiopian food, then Axum won't disappoint you.  It may become one of your favorite places to eat for this cuisine.\n\n-------\n3/27/07\nNot happy.  Their portions have shrunk considerably.  To about half the amount of food they use to dish out.  These were the vegetarian items.  No idea if they did the same with the meat dishes.  No complaints about the flavor of the food.", "author": "Animal K."}

And no, I don't eat it all myself, but I do my best--elbowing Kelsey, gently nudging her away as I scoop up the last bits of delicious legumes, greens, and mushrooms.  In fact, pretty much every time Kelsey and I try to figure out where to eat, I say, \"Axum!\" and Kelsey says, \"not again!\"  But that's fine, because absence makes the heart grow fonder, or whatever.  \n\nAnyway, their veggie platter is delicious and very, very filling.  The staff is friendly when they recognize you, but they can be a little chilly toward newcomers or \"me, me, me\"-type customers--which is fine by me, as I'm always creeped out by super-friendly (usually forced) service.  I like my servers to keep it real.  And I like humble customers.  \n\nAxum also has Harar beer, which, when I feel like living it up (an entree AND a drink?  No way!), I order.  It's sweet, it's good, and it's a nice way to wash down your injera.  \n\nI deduct one star only because their spinach tasted a bit rotten once (out of roughly a million times, so the odds are slim; but still, if I'm paying for it, I want to be able to eat it without worrying about what will happen to me later).", "author": "Alyson Y."}

Ooh, you ate it with your fingers while your folks shelled out $13 for a vegetarian entree.    Then I moved to SF and was initially seduced by the inexpensive fare of Axum cafe: delightful, until, like Tina Turner after returning, black-eyed, again and again to Ike, I finally declared myself free of my relationship with Axum Cafe.  The final straw: an attempt to cater a party with veggie-friendly options while supporting local business, to which I met utter indifference from the staff/owner(?) waitron I spoke to on a slow afternoon.  A brief summary:\n\nI: \"I'd like to cater a small get-together, with food for about seven people.\"\n\nMiddle-aged waitron:  \"You can get the combo for five plus the combo for two, or the combo for four plus the combo for three.\"\n\nI:  \"Yes, but each combo becomes less expensive with the more people it serves.  What would it be for a combo for seven?\"\n\nMiddle-aged waitron: \"There's no combo for seven\"\n\nI:  \"Is there anyone else I can talk to?\"\n\nMiddle-aged waitron: \"Nobody else is here.\"\n\nAfter a couple years of hiatus, I finally return to Axum.  The table's order vanishes as the adjacent table is seated and served while my dinner companion and I wait for half an hour.  Finally, a staff member (the proprietor?) asks what we've been waiting for as middle-aged waitron serves other tables.  Finally our food arrives, and we pledge never again to bother with Axum.  There are plenty of other, tastier Ethiopean/Eritrean joints in this town, two of them just up Haight Street.  We'll be going there from now onl.", "author": "Eric K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-05", "description": "Good ethiopian food.  I had the lentils, lamb and one of the spicy grilled beefs.  All flavorful, especially the lentils.  Although I've had better lamb at an Ethiopian place before, this was still good.  The beef was quite flavorful and the bread was light.", "author": "Kristen T."}

Thats not a problem for me. But the food quality was definitely mediocre. We had the veggie platter, very ordinary compared to massawa/assab. Ambience isnt much to talk about. Its in the Haight, so parking isnt the easiest.. 2.5 stars", "author": "A A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-27", "description": "3.5 stars\nI've been to this place twice. The first time, we tried to order but we got it all wrong and the server (who is also one of the owners, I think), basically said \"Um, no\", and then he left for about half an hour. Apparently, you have to order in number of portions, and we tried to do too few since we weren't that hungry. When we finally got our food, it was really good. The injera is like a sour, spongy pancake that you use to scoop up all the different types of ....vegetable and meat dips/sauces/purees/stews. \nAnyway, I went again tonight, and this time we knew how to order! I felt so great about myself when he nodded approvingly after we ordered correctly.\nSo yeah, the service was much better this time, the woman who mostly served us was really nice and checked up on us a lot. The food is strongly spiced and very filling (order less than you think you'll need--if they let you!). It wasn't great (hence the 3.5 stars), but I'd definitely go back, especially since it was pretty cheap.", "author": "Vanessa L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-20", "description": "This place was adequate.  The food was fine, the people there were nice enough.   I love Ethiopian food and have had it a few times before and i would say this was the most mediocre of my experiences.  Except whatever #2 on the menu was was really good.  The rest sure was food.  It tasted okay enough.  One disappointment was the paucity of choices.  Perhaps i have been spoiled by being offered a fairly wide selection of items at other Ethiopian restaraunts.  There were only 5 vegetarian options and of the meat options, all but two were prepared the exact same way.  Also, the bread (i forgot the name) was cold.  The nice thing about Ethiopian food though is that it is fun to eat with friends and that makes up for a lot of shortcomings.  Despite the general feeling of \"meh\" this place created, i still enjoyed myself.   I would say if you are in the area and want Ethiopian, this place is fine, but if you are traveling to get to it, give a different place a shot.", "author": "courtney e."}

It's one of those cuisines that I crave often and can eat almost every day. The meat dishes are great and spicy and I always leave full and happy. Careful with the injera bread though - for all its thinness and lightness it does make you feel full right away. Pace yourself!", "author": "Lee P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-17", "description": "I've been to some of the best restaurants in the Bay Area (including the French Laundry, Kokkari, Town Hall, Salt House, Chaya Brasserie, Aqua, One Market) and I can attest to the fact that I'd still consider Axum one of the best restaurants in the Bay Area and for its kind. And I'm a very demanding customer, to start with.  I won't go back to a restaurant that fails to deliver (a recent example: COI that just got a one Michelin star and absolutely sucked in every way or UNICORN which is overrated in many ways or even SCOTT's Seafood in Jack London Square). I've been going to Axum for many, many years, I think close to, if not more than, 10 years. Some of the reviews to some of the Ethiopian restaurants contain exaggerations. Axum is awesome! And that's not an exaggeration.  Flavor, spices, service, atmosphere (casual neighborhood feeling with some ethnic aura away from the hectic rushed lifestyle) -- all perfect! Tipsie chicken is my favorite item and all the veggies rock! And the salad dressing is superb! I go there often and fight over the food with my friends.  And I love the family that owns the restaurant.  I remember for a while the mother was pregnant all the time (I think they have 4 or 5 kids).  This is a very warm restaurant with excellent food.  And the so-called \"bland\" bread that some reviewers have mentioned, it's ironic: this is the restaurant's introduction of whole wheat injera -- in obvious response to health conscious San Franciscans' lifestyle and demands.", "author": "Yanni G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-04", "description": "I have to admit, my first experience with Ethiopian-type cuisine was at Assab, so that may have spoiled me a little bit, but this place is definitely comparable.  The actual place is your standard San Francisco restaurant, nothing overly elegant or exotic but definitely comfortable and clean.  Service was limited to one waiter on this particular night (who I have a slight suspicion must be either the owner or somehow affiliated with the company financially, since he seemed pretty delighted when we mentioned that we found the place by looking online).  I ordered the fish entree and my friends had a 2 person platter of assorted vegetables.  Overall the food was pretty good, not quite as flavorful or plentiful as Assab, but definitely worth the price (about $12-13 a person).  The waiter seemed pretty friendly and even went out of his way to get us change (he ran all the way out to his car in the rain).  The building could benefit from some better lighting (it was pretty dark on an overcast day inside).  I would definitely recommend the place to anyone interested in trying out Ethiopian food in the area, but if you're looking for the best-of-the-best, I would recommend making a reservation at Assab and checking that place out first.  Definitely cannot complain about Axum though, overall a nice place to eat some good food.", "author": "Luis M."}
