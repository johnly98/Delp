Before moving to San Francisco a few weeks ago I had actually heard of this place while living in Alabama from one of those random videos on Facebook that tell you about cool places around the country. It wasn't from a mac'd sponsored ad. It mad such an impact though that even only seeing the video one time I knew I had to try this place at some point. Now I live just a few blocks from it and had to go the day I moved here. \n\nSo the service was ehh but the menu has a good number of options and not too many options. The Mac and cheese itself was quite good. It's like a fancy Mac and cheese not the creamy style that I am used to from the south. I still enjoyed it.", "author": "Alex J."}

Yummy, cheesy, and nice large piece of rib.\n- Goddess sauce (garlic) with pasta shells, bacon, peas, and topped with panko.\n- Basic sauce over cauliflower, with broccoli, bacon, and mushrooms, topped with Hot Cheetos!\n\nAll were delicious.

So once you come in, you go straight to the cashier to order your food. I got the original cheese dish with bacon, hot Cheetos, parmesan, and chicken in it. Toppings are unlimited unless otherwise noted (some toppings they charge). Process was quick and easy. You grab your own water, fork, and napkin. Sit anywhere you want and then wait for your food to be called. Mine took about a 10-12 min wait, which was super quick. On the table, they have 4-5 hot sauces that you can add to your dish - even sriracha! \n\nThe food was super super delicious. I've had hot Cheeto Mac n cheese at a place in Long Beach and this place really exceeded my expectations. It was cheesy, savory, a little Smokey, and crunchy because of the hot Cheetos! We even got the Brussels Sprouts with garlic. Oh man! I honestly hate Brussels sprouts but this one made me change my mind. Theirs was crunchy and roasted, came with a side of ranch and I was just blown away! \n\nDefinitely recommend everyone to come try this place. It was $12 for the dish and it was enough for lunch and dinner. Bang for your buck and great food? I'll be back", "author": "Sherluna V."}

The portion size I thought was initially very average, however the whole meal was incredibly dense. I like to think of myself as a big eater and even this had me at near full capacity. It was to the point that I didn't want to finish my fries and had to save it for later which is not often. \n\nThe place is pretty self serve, you go order at the cashier, then you grab all your own utensils and such and you wait for your name to be called to grab your order. \n\nWould definitely recommend for everyone to try.

This is a little gem hidden in the Marina and is rather easy to get to. I came on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have to wait at all (although there was a street festival going on a few streets down, so perhaps that's where the crowds went). We took a ride to the place but there did seem to be street parking available!\n\nAs soon as we entered the property you see the \"Stay Cheesin'\"neon sign on an art wall. To your right you can walk straight to the counter where you see a large menu on the wall that depicts the price ($11) where you can choose your sauce, pasta, mix-ins and toppings. I chose to go with the garlic sauce, shell pasta, bacon, corn, peas, panko and parmesan. Do note that although most mix-ins are included in the initial price, but some options (mostly the meat/seafood options) cost a few extra dollars. At the time I went they ran out of broccoli so the cashier informed me that they were allowing brussels sprouts as a substitute. \n\nWe waited no longer than ten minutes for our dishes to come out and when we got them they were literally perfection. The servings are also rather large -- I finished less than half before feeling fully satisfied. They have easy to grab to-go containers right next to the dish return area. If you have a general small appetite, I would say that simply eating the mac and cheese dish is sufficient. I initially wanted to order some fries on the side but I am glad I didn't because the serving size of the fries is huge (nearly as big as the bowl of mac and cheese) and I definitely wouldn't have finished it considering I couldn't even finish my main dish. \n\nOverall, I had a great experience at this place and the idea of building your own quality mac and cheese is just super awesome.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-29", "description": "We finally visited MAC'D yesterday. I feared that they would be closed (Memorial Day); but, we were pleased to find them open.\n\nCONCEPT: Simply put, Mac'd focuses on offering custom mac-n-cheese. Like a Chipotle, Pieology or Subway, you're the author of your dish. \n\n1.) Choose cheese sauce (from 5-6 options).\n2.) Choose pasta (from four options).\n3.) Choose unlimited mix-ins (including 15-16 meats, veggies, etc.).\n4.) Choose unlimited toppings (from 6-8 options).\n\nIt is all about the OPTIONS. Most of these options go very well together. I suppose that failure can be an option. However, it is a certainty if you never try. \n\nLOCATION: Mac'd is located in the beautiful Marina District (just off of Lombard) near the corner of Chestnut and Fillmore. There is plenty of free parking along Fillmore or one of the cross streets. \n\nIf you're a tourist biking to the Golden Gate Bridge, then this might be a perfect place to order something. You can take it to go and have a nice picnic next to the bay with scenic views of the bridge just a five blocks away. \n\nFOOD: I loved it. Not only was the mac-n-cheese fantastic, but the sides and appetizers were great too. We ordered some fried pickles. I noticed others ordering garlic parmesian truffle or cheese fries. Someone ordered one of their three varieties of hot wings. \n\nDRINKS: Standard bottles, cans and pitchers. No fountain sodas. Water is free.\n\nAMBIANCE: The location is nice. However, it was strangely quiet. There was a big television that wasn't turned on -- odd given the fact that Game 7 of the NBA Western Conference Finals was on (complete with the Golden State Warriors).  \n\nI would recommend that the store needs to achieve something a bit more memorable for ambiance. Either turn on the TV (with volume), play the radio or offer some sort of soft and \"inspired\" instrumental music (maybe jazz) that sets a mood for this particular location. Otherwise, the ambiance is the greatest weakness of the location. It is forgettable. \n\nOVERALL: This is worth a visit if you're in the area. It offers great food from an interesting concept near one of the most lovely areas of the city.", "author": "Chris M."}

While I love the concept of this restaurant and what it could be, it simply does not live up to the hype I excepted, considering how good of a job they do marketing this place. We walked in, and it is a small place, self seating, with one person up front to take your order. \n\nWe walked in, and waited, and waited, and waited. 10 minutes go by before the young lady taking orders came back to the register to take a few orders. Then we finally get up to the register and off she goes again for another 5 minutes to clear tables. \n\nWe finally get a chance to order our food. The woman had no recommendations, didn't seem to know the flavor profiles of the food and was just all around in a \"I hate being here\" mood. I went it order a beer and asked her what IPA style beers they had on hand. She pointed to a small selection of canned beer on the counter and I picked one out. Much to my surprise it was not even close to an IPA it was essentially bud light. \n\nAnyway, we get a table and take a seat waiting for our food. Watching the staff in this place was like people watching a Walmart. Three people working very hard in the kitchen, a tall Hispanic kid, a short Hispanic man and a shorter woman. The woman from the register seemed to have a massive amount of food in her mouth as you could see every bit of food in her mouth from across the room as she chewed. The guy handing peoples food out seemed to have no issue dishing out not only food but orders to the young woman up front as he merely stood there and shuffled some trays around. \n\nThe food came and it was rather disappointing. The cheese sauce initially has decent flavor, but it quickly does off and they skimp to the max on the mix ins that you select and. The place was very dingy and felt gross.

I was one of the victims.\n\nMy friend and I had plans to meet up for dinner here around 8pm and even at 8pm the line was out the door and it took a good while just to get a foot in the door and yet still be far away from the counter to order. Their menu isn't super extensive and you are given lots of time to figure out what you want to order which is cool, but the wait was just tiring. And the place isn't relatively big so while you're in line you should also probably keep your eye out on a table opening up. \n\nI was able to snag a table while my boyfriend and our friends waited in line and for my Mac & cheese I ordered the goddess, elbow macaroni, mushrooms, corn, chorizo, and added crab for an extra $3. Not only that, but I also got an order of their garlic parm truffle fries for $4 or $6. I can't remember correctly, but.... \n\nFries - not worth. With a name like \"garlic parm truffle\" you'd think those fries would be out of the world amazing but they literally tasted like nothing. Like plain ol' fries that you should just throw some salt on top because the cook forgot to do it. \n\nAnd my Mac? With crab added for an extra fee? Eh. I should've added some broccoli in first to give my meal some color and then the crab? Pass on that. For $3 extra it was like a journey trying to find the crab in my plate and flavor wise? I could not taste a dang thing. I'm not trying to be cruel, but honestly I feel like Mac and cheese from Popeyes (which I had gotten on Friday after work) was way more satisfying than the Mac and cheese I got here. And they're pricey, too, which added to the bummer.\n\nSo why 3 stars? Because it wasn't a completely bad meal. You get fresh Mac & cheese cooked to you and you're able to customize what you want inside which is nice. But the price hurts it. \n\nAs my boyfriend said after our meal, \"Babe, don't ever take me to a Mac and cheese place every again, please.\"", "author": "Venus L."}

I didn't get sick at least, but it was not good, and I didn't finish it. Thinking that maybe seafood wasn't their strong-suit, I tried this place again. It was so incredibly mediocre. \"Ok, well, looks like they will definitely go out of business like the last three places that were here.\" Mac and Cheese is SO good and easy, how do you f*** this up?\n\nThen, I noticed that they had large tour bus groups stop by and all of a sudden there were lines out the door.

Unfortunately, half of the wait time is used trying to find a seat.  Waited in line for 30 min and then waited another 10-15 min to nab a table.  I was also getting the feeling that the host was moving a bit slowly taking orders and then casually walking to the back to chat with the chefs and such before coming back out to take more orders- not sure if this was to pace the # of people coming in vs. leaving, but the overall effect was SUPER slow.  Also took a good 30 min to get our food.  \n\nFood: as expected, they serve only mac and cheese, but you can choose the different types of sauces, condiments, and other additions to your plate.  I ordered Elbows with Goddess Sauce (garlic), peas, ham, and panko for $10, which is decent given the HUGE portion they give you.  Pasta was slightly overcooked and I almost wish there was even more cheese (if there's such a thing) - I kinda expected it to be all gooey, cheesy and such but it was more just a bechamel sauce that was light in cheese flavor.  Could have used even more garlic in my goddess sauce since it was slightly light for my taste.

With so many items in the mix, none of the individual flavors stand out and it ends up as a pile of goopiness. \n\nLet's start with the shells themselves: These were a bit removed from al dente, though not terribly soft either. Large portion size, especially when combined with all the fixin's.\n\nSauce: There was a light garlic taste in goddess, which is their garlic sauce, but the cheese taste wasn't too strong. It was sort of goopy (maybe due to the truffle oil?)-- maybe I've grown accustomed to bougie mac though. 2.5/5.\n\nToppings: Even under the sauce, you could tell that they used quality toppings. Their ham was cut thick and had both fatty and non-fatty parts. The bacon was smoky anddd fatty. Hot dogs are hot dogs (I love hot dogs....), chicken was standard, shrimp was cooked really crunchy (this stood out-- this never happens except at fine dining or Asian establishments...), the crab actually existed and was real (and was a $3 only topping!?), etc. 4/5. The mushrooms were cut a bit too thin for mouth feel though.\n\nThe brussel sprouts were pretty standard, though a bit oily (with crisp outer leaves!), but could have benefited from more flavoring. 3.3/5.\n\nTakeout experience: They messed up my friend's order (she got cauliflower instead of noodles but they gave her noodles). The containers they used weren't the most suitable since their product is saucy but the containers don't fully seal (see photos of spillage). I actually enjoyed the dish more upon heating up takeout, making me think the issue I had with the food was more related to heat and presentation.\n\nIt's a 3.3 for me, but I could understand why this place is better in person!", "author": "Nicole H."}

Why wouldn't you want to build your own mac and cheese?? Pick your sauce, your pasta shape and your toppings?? SUCH a good idea.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed by everything.\n\n1) The pasta sauce was very bland. It needed to have more sharp cheese to give it more flavor. It was not flavorful at all\n2). The pasta had clearly been sitting there all day\n3) The broccoli and corn that I added in were clearly frozen from bags\n4) The toppings- The truffle oil was not good quality, I could tell it was really cheap. The panko bread crumbs were also too big and didn't mesh well with the mac and cheese\n\nAnother extremely disappointing factor was that there was only plastic silverware and dinnerware, even though . I was eating it there. I understand it's only a $10 meal, but I really dislike eating things with plastic unless i'm at a park because it's less enjoyable. A restaurant 100% should have regular bowls and utensils for customers who eat there. I'm not sure where these pictures are coming from with real bowls.\n\nLastly, none of the cooks were wearing hairnets which was kind of gross in my opinion.\n\noverall, i won't be coming here again unless something drastically changes in the quality of ingredients.

Parking is street only and we found a spot a couple blocks away. I think we came at peak dinner time because there was a line out the door. Didn't look like that many parties ahead of us - maybe 7-8 but it still took about 40 minutes or so to get up to the front to order. I'm sure the service isn't really slow - it's just that if everyone in the group gets a customizable mac and cheese dish, it can take a while to ramble off all the mix-ins and toppings you want. Also it's not stated on the big menu what the type of sauces are. It just has the name listed. So I'm sure people have questions or there is an 8.5 by 11\" laminated menu that you can peruse while you're up there. Thus people spend even more time up there. Yeah, there's probably things they can do to speed up the ordering process. I looked on yelp and their website and didn't see a way to call in or online order in advance or anything. My bf got the drunken pig, which is one of their few pre-determined combos. It looked like it was just elbow macaroni in the basic sauce and topped with pulled pork. I made my own creation - the goddess sauce with shells; mix-ins included bacon, chicken, broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes; topped with parmesan, panko and truffle oil. I really liked mine except for two minor things - I could barely taste the chicken and it was a little salty. I didn't notice it too badly at first but it definitely got saltier the more I ate it. The goddess sauce is super cheesy (three cheeses) and pretty garlicy too - I liked it. And there was a good amount of bacon in it. The other friend just got meat in hers because she thought if she got veggies, they'd put less meat in it but I still got some bacon with almost every bite in mine even though I got veggies in my dish. Food took about 20 minutes to come out. So yeah it was an hour before we could eat. Luckily, I wasn't starving or else I would've gotten hangry. It's about $11 for a big thing of mac n cheese, which is not too badly priced but prob a little expensive considering it's just mac n cheese.  I was definitely full about 2/3 of the wat through my plate but it was too little to bring home so I just powered through and finished it.  But they serve it to you in a foil to-go container so all you need is a paper lid, if you did want to take it to go. Seems a little wasteful to serve everything in togo containers but it's convenient. I would probably come back again if I didn't have to wait.", "author": "Alison W."}

Dropped by again on Easter Sunday and the place had no line at all so I finally decided to give it a try.\n\nMy friend and I split a hellapeno mac and cheese w/ chorizo, banana peppers, tomatoes topped w/ parmesan, truffle oil, and hot cheetos. Basically you pay $11 for a base, choose a pasta, choose mix-ins, and toppings. The base mac and cheese was pretty good. Decent amount of heat (noticeable but won't burn) and a good amount of cheese (sauce itself isn't too rich but they top w/ more cheese on top). It's an all around fine mac and cheese. The problem was with the mix ins. Every item came in a chunk and there weren't 2-4 chunks. We literally thought they forgot our chorizo til we each bit into a giant cove of it. Same w/ the peppers and the tomatoes. The toppings are fine but honestly don't add much besides a pop of color.\n\nBasically for $11 you're getting a semi-decent mac and cheese with the added bonus of feeling like you got something fancier.

Good flavor and consistency. However, this vegetarian was not a happy camper after finding many pieces of bacon in the mac and cheese. Super not cool. So after spitting out the first piece and eyeing more, I had to examine every shell and leave a decent portion of the mac and cheese behind.

My friends and I placed vastly different orders, but we were all very pleased with how they turned out. Pricing was very transparent and I liked how there was no limit to the number of toppings you can add and no extra charge for standard proteins like chicken and sausage. The restaurant is extremely accommodating to those with dietary restrictions- a vegan sauce and cauliflower \"pasta\" is available if classic mac and cheese isn't your thing.\n\nDownside is that they still have issues to iron out in their supply chain. I arrived 30 minutes before closing on a Sunday night, and they were out of whole wheat pasta and chicken, amongst several other ingredients.  The line to order took about 10 minutes, and the employee left twice to help finish other tasks in the kitchen. MAC'D is presented as a fast-casual restaurant, and perhaps opening weekend was much busier than usual, but it took 20 minutes for our food to come out- waaay longer than similar restaurants in this category.", "author": "Amy C."}

Boy am I glad I tried MAC'd! We visited during their soft opening (grand opening is today, July 14) and were able to try a few dishes. The idea behind MAC'D is a Chipotle-style customization for your mac n cheese dish. You first choose your cheese sauce and then you can add different kinds of toppings like lobster or tri-tip (for extra fees), veggies, sauce, etc. Keep in mind you just order at the register and decide there. It's not like you follow a worker down the line and choose what you want like Chipotle. The workers will call your name when your order is ready.\n\nWe got the Goddess (garlic sauce) and the Basic (chedder). We added toppings like chorizo, Hot Cheetos, bacon, chicken, peas, corn, etc. You can even choose different types of pasta like shells or elbows. We loved both dishes! We also got a side order of the fried brussel sprouts. They have a nice crisp and a sweet taste to them.\n\nThey have occupied a big space and there seems to be enough suitable tables for everyone. One great thing to note is that they are open late nights until 2am on Fridays and Saturdays. Perfect for people who are partying late and need a midnight snack (just don't be that annoying and disrespecting drunk person).\n\nI would suggest adding more lighter side orders on the menu to balance the heaviness of the creamy mac n cheese and fried food.", "author": "Michael T."}

I drove there and went in to share my experience with the manager and staff and they were also genuinely disturbed and surprised but had no explanation as to how that could've happened.

After a day of dress-shopping, we decided to treat ourselves to some mac n' cheese because if you put cheese on roasted cauliflower, that's healthy right?\n\nRating Breakdown:\n2/2 Stars for Taste --\nI chose Hellape\u00f1o sauce on shells with pretty much every mix-in and topped with panko and truffle oil. Delicious. The sauce was rich and not too spicy or oily. The mix-in's were pretty well distributed -- a few of my favorites included the broccoli and the chorizo. The crisp of the panko and the subtle fragrance of the truffle oil made the whole dish a slam dunk. My friend ordered the Goddess sauce on roasted cauliflower with all the toppings. I liked the garlic sauce...but I liked the kick of my jalapeno sauce even better. The roasted cauliflower was definitely interesting. You can never replace the satisfaction of gluten, but this was a nearly worthy substitute. \n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\n$11 for a skillet of mac n' cheese. This sounds like a lot, but the variety of the mix-ins you can choose from (4-5 types of meat alone! truffle oil! broccoli!) and the portion sizes (I ate myself sick and I still have half in the fridge.) give this dish a good bang for your buck. I love truffle mac n' cheese, and I have never seen it for less than $12...and that's without meat. Certain customizations cost extra -- roasted cauliflower, lobster, crab, fried chicken. The plate of truffle fries was $6 and the serving size looked HUGE. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nUnbeknownst to me, this place has quite the cult following after being featured in a Facebook video. The line was out the door! The owner came out to warn us that it would be 45 minutes to order then another 45 minutes until our food would be ready. This deterred quite a few people in front of us in line but the time estimate turned out to be pretty accurate. The small kitchen is definitely not equipped to handle such high volumes of customers (they need another oven or one of those long conveyer belt kinds like Quizno's or Costco pizza), but they're doing their best. I asked for no banana peppers but I also saw how busy they were and thought, \"oh well, i'll just eat it.\" I think they have a few kinks to iron out, but I wish them the best of luck because they've got quite a thing going on here.\n\nHalf a bonus star because I would come again if only for the food, but not unless I had 2-3 hours to kill (WHO HAS THAT KIND OF TIME.)\n\nTL;DR: $11 customized mac n' cheese.

However, right after we ordered, the line began snaking out the door. Even though we ordered before the crowd came, we still waited quite a while for the food. The cooks also made more than a few mistakes for other people while we were waiting; one guy had to wait five minutes for his food to be put into a to-go box, a girl was missing toppings, another girl didn't get her fries, and they also dropped one order and had to remake it.

Further it's open until 2AM.\n\nThere was a decent crowd inside, however, I felt the menu options weren't very varied. Their \"pre-made\" dishes were okay and nothing piqued my interest, so I made my own from the a-la-carte options available.\n\nNow, I went with a group of people and their food came out pretty quickly.....but mine was nowhere to be found. I went up to the kitchen counter area and asked if James has been called and they shrugged me away saying that James was called a little bit ago. Confused, I went around and asked the cashier what happened and he was unsure as well.\n\nAfter some standing around, they realized someone else took my order. The cashier then proceeded to punch in my order again.\n\nI finally received my food and wasn't overall impressed with it.

First off I am not a Mac and cheese person but the goddess sauce (I'm a garlic girl all the way) was amazing and hot Cheetos are my favorite chips, so win. I also just loved the way my first bite also exploded with truffle taste and lastly the brussels sprouts had a decent amount of bacon BUT I kept on stealing my friends truffle fries because it was crispy and flavorful. If you look closely you can also see that they have interesting Korean ingredients like kimchi and gochujang. I couldn't finish because they gave me a decent amount so I had an extra meal the next day. \n\nLocation: love that it's in the Marina, which is an adorable location with a lot of stores you can window shop and explore afterwards.\n\nParking: this is San Francisco and this area is one of the more difficult areas to find parking and I ended up using a meter and paying for 2.5 hours worth of time because...\n\nWait time: I would say I waited around 1.5 hours in the line and 15 minutes for the food to come out.

I also think of lines as a way to give me more time to catch up with my friends.

The other person was preparing the food onto dishes, and calling out ready orders.\n\nI think it's ridiculous, having to wait 2 hours for mac & cheese. It was our first time here, and in any other situation we would not have stayed to wait that long for Mac & cheese. We just wanted to try something new, which made us want to stay.\n\nWhen we finally got the food, our orders were right (sort, of), but I had my friend's food and she had our other friend's food, so we had to exchange dishes. I also ordered Hot Cheetos as a topping, but I didn't have any, hence our orders were *sort of* right. I don't know how that happened because our dishes were made at the same time. If I had to wait 2 hours for Mac & cheese, I'd like to at least receive MY order and have it made correctly. But yes, I do understand that there were a lot of people, and they have to be fast.\n\nI think they are less busy on weekdays, so if you don't want to stand in line for and hour and a half, don't go on the weekend.

I had the Frenchie and ordered bacon chicken ham broccoli mushrooms kimchi panko parmesan crisps truffle oil and gochujang..umm that's a lot, but I firmly believe they left out broccoli, panko, and gochujang..I was looking forward to my mac and cheese but when it when it came I was like \"ohh..hmm\" and yes I do believe they left out more than one ingredient that is on my receipt..I know because the receipt is still in my gmail. Just look at my mac pic--do you see broccoli or panko? I also ordered the fried brussels sprouts and those were pretty good and not overpriced at $5. I also got a Parrot coconut water and that was $3. All drinks are $3. So I paid just a little under $20 for all this. Well, the mac and cheese didn't totally satisfy me, but I ate all of it. I thought the ingredients were lacking something..maybe flavor. The Frenchie is French onion soup base, but I couldn't taste it. \n\nI have heard about Homeroom in Oakland that serves up mac and cheese..I believe that is quite different in experience and quality.

Who doesn't love macaroni and cheese? But what else could you get for $10? Hm..burrito, pho, some sushi, pizza, rice dish, fried chicken...Who knows? Maybe you will try out Mac'd in the Marina and like it more than I did. I hope so.

This place is definitely off to a great start! You have a pretty standard menu to choose sauce/cheese type, noodle type, and extras like meats or veggies and toppings. I went for the classic cheese on shells, with bacon and peas mixed in and no topping. My friend went for the classic noodles with the goddess sauce and it looked pretty good too! My boyfriend also did the classic cheese with shells, but added in jalape\u00f1os, and a bunch of crust toppings. The great thing about this place is that everyone can create something that they like. The time it takes to order your dish and get it to your table isn't too long.\n\nI would say two biggest issues were that the portions felt a bit small. I left still feeling hungry, and for $11 as your base for mac and cheese? You kinda want to leave feeling like it was worth your money. The second thing is while I demolished my dish, I left wishing the cheese was a bit creamier. All three of our dishes had the cheese melted, but it would bunch up once the dish was cooled. If they add a bit more cream to the sauces, it would be perfect.", "author": "Kristen T."}

Meats such as chicken, hot dog, ham, and bacon are unlimited at no extra cost. I chose bacon, lobster, mushrooms, and corn.

Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the cauliflower is ... crunchy. Not completely raw, but definitely not soft or warm, which would make it more pasta-like. That was a big disappointment. The vegan sauce was good, but a little low on flavor. I'd recommend getting something spicy to mix in if you're gluten intolerant and need to eat the vegan sauce (all of the other sauces supposedly contain gluten). Crab was $3 extra, but I didn't taste one single bit of crab in mine. I think they completely forgot to put it in. The corn was unremarkable (not fresh or particularly sweet or anything), and there were maybe 8 bits of tomato. \n\nI'm not sure I'll try this place again unless I hear that they upped their cauliflower game (I wonder if just a simple par-boil it before whatever else they do would help?), but if I did, I'd stay with the vegan sauce and add something spicy to the mix. \n\nThe concept is so great, but the execution is lacking.

Finally, the stars were aligning and things were going my way?\n\n-My close friend and I made the trip to the Marina district for their grand opening weekend. Wow, I was en route to a restaurant that had A1 lighting for the gram as well as savory mac and cheese. When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with an aesthetically pleasing neon sign that said, \"Stay Cheesin'\" The menu felt very personal and catered to customers, like we were the boss of what was going to be fed into our mouths. \n\n-When ordering, I debated between The #Basic, or The Goddess. After much time and thought was placed into my one order, I decided what extras to order with my Goddess. Next to the register, was a white board sign that had items not available to be ordered for customers. Since they were out of The Goddess, I I settled with The Frenchie (french onion soup flavored). I've never drunk french onion soup before, but of course I was expecting a very onion-y flavor to be left in my mouth.\n\n-The wait for my mac and cheese took approximately 15-20 minutes, which was pleasant. Not too long, not too short of a time. My friend and I were seated next to where the mac and cheese was prepped, so we were able to see the process. Right when I sat down to wait, I heard one of the co-founders of Mac'd say, \"2 Goddesses.\" What!? I thought they ran out of The Goddess? Were my ears fooling me? Just hearing that made me sad, but it's not like I was going to change my order right then and there. \n\n-After spending time taking photos of our creations, my friend and I dove into our macs. The peas were a pale green, not a cheery or healthy looking shade. The French Onion had a very faint onion taste. \n\n-My total was $10.80 because I checked in on Yelp and received $1 off the total. When I handed over a $20 bill, the cashier told me that she didn't have enough change. I was surprised since it wasn't like I handed her $100, but I obliged and instead used Apple Pay. \n\nThe whole concept of a do-it-yourself mac and cheese restaurant is pure genius.

The sauce with panko topping was great, but the cauliflower was not cooked soft so it tasted hard and raw-- totally not what I expected. If you like raw vegan it is still bad because they could have made it cauliflower rice. What I got was chucks of hard, almost raw combo broccoli and cauliflower drizzled with vegan sauce.... and they served it luke warm, not hot at all! can't believe I pad $17 ($3 extra for vegan, $3 extra for cauliflower) for this little disappointing, un-satisfying meal....\nThank you but with all the right ingredients they could have made it such a wonderful dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-17", "description": "Can I get an AMEN for this new slice of heaven? The options are pretty much endless; I was almost glad for the long opening weekend line, since it gave me time to decide what to eat. I ended up getting basic sauce on shells with jalape\u00f1os, longaniza, and bread crumbs, but I couldn't really have gone wrong with anything else. My friend got garlicky goddess sauce on elbows with jalape\u00f1os, mushrooms, bacon, and hot Cheetos, and it was also fannnntastic. I'm not a hot Cheetos fan in general - I've eaten them one time and pretty much wrote them off after that - but man, you put em on a mac and cheese and I am very much there.\n\nThe cheese sauces I had were both so, so satisfying. I find that mac and cheese as a side dish at a lot of places tends to be more focused on creamy texture than on a punch of flavor, but such is not the case at Mac'd. My tastebuds were all lit up the whole time. If you're worried that there won't quite be enough fireworks for you, though, never fear: Mac'd has a flavor station that is well-stocked with sriracha, Tabasco, Crystal, Frank's, and a few that are specially made for Mac'd. When we got there on opening day, these specially made ones were almost out, which is fair enough. Hopefully, that means there's enough demand that there will be more and more as time goes on!\n\nA side of honey sriracha brussels sprouts made even my brussels sprouts-hating friend eat a couple of them, and the prices were really, really low. For most combos, it's $11 a bowl, and you can easily get two meals out of that. I did, and I don't even have self-control. Some premium toppings are extra, but you can't exactly fault them for charging you extra for tri-tip. TRI-TIP. IN YOUR MAC AND CHEESE.\n\nThe space itself is nice and clean, very casual, which is fine. I got my mac to go because the place was too busy to sit and eat. Even on opening weekend, the wait time still wasn't bad, and the food was more than worth it. I don't usually go out of my way to visit the Marina, but for Mac'd, I'm gonna make an exception, and I'm gonna make it several times.", "author": "AJ P."}

If I tried it again, I would add more meat since it is complimentary to a point.\n\nOverall experienced better food on my visit to SF - at the same time, this was my friend's favorite spot we went to.

Customers in line had to wait for the cashier/bartender to finish making other peoples drinks before attending to them. This could have been a day where they were short a person?

The restaurant offers a choice of sauce, noodle type, add-ins and toppings. I ordered shell pasta, the garlicky 'Goddess Sauce\", tomatoes, broccoli, crab, truffle oil, panko, and shredded parmesan to top it off. I also ordered the bacon-ranch brussels sprouts. The food was good and looked & smelled amazing, however the Goddess Sauce was very liquidy and my mac barely had any crab--which costed extra to add in. I LOVED the brussels sprouts. The location was very clean and the staff was friendly. I am glad I tried MAC'D but I am not sure if I would spend this much on mediocre mac any time soon.", "author": "Leah G."}

In each situation, they've demonstrated that not only are they not friendly (I'm okay with neutral service), but they're down right patronizing and antagonistic (to the point that I think they want to lose business). \n\nSituation 1 (from a couple of months ago): tried to order one of their specials and asked if I could substitute the pasta with the cauliflower; got a 3 min ranting lecture explaining why they couldn't. I'm fine that they can't, but it's not written anywhere on their menu board, and a polite and curt \"sorry we can't\" would've sufficed. \n\nSituation 2 (from a few weeks ago): accidently asked for a \"side\" of the chicken (instead of a \"topping\" of the chicken) and was rudely greeted with \"can't you read?\"... Ugh. Would it have killed you to have just said, \"did you mean the topping?\" \n\nSituation 3 (today): walked in the door at 11:05 am (their advertised opening time is 11 am) and was promptly scolded out of the store with a \"we aren't open\", and then proceeded to hear the manager(?) scold a poor worker for \"accidently leaving the door open\". If you advertise a certain opening time but can't meet that expectation, please don't take that out on me. \n\nSeriously, not impressed by the customer service (the little things count), and yes, will think hard about coming back.", "author": "Richard L."}

Mac and cheese was always my favorite growing up so I was really excited to discover this place while walking around San Fran. I like the idea of choosing what pasta, cheese, and toppings to put in your dish. I wasn't feeling that adventurous when I went, so I just opted for the Basic cheese sauce, ham, bacon, and panko. There's lots of options for you to mix in like vegetables and seafood (although idk about the idea of corn being in mac and cheese..)\n\nMy friends and I all got different sauces so we could try it all. The Goddess had a really distinct garlicky taste that was apparent, but not overpowering. The bacon/beer sauce tasted good too, but it wasn't as cheesy as I'd thought it'd be.\n\nThe toppings are unlimited and they all cost $11, which is a little bit on the pricey side but I thought it was a good experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-03", "description": "Let me start off by saying this review is for the vegan cheese sauce only. Verdict? Not great. \n\nMac'd has a lot going for it. I love the concept of build-it-yourself mac and cheese and the huge selections of toppings you can add (for no extra cost, woo!) is great. And I can truly appreciate that they offer non-dairy and gluten free options because creamy pasta options for the lactose intolerant is hard to find. \n\nI got the elbow pasta with vegan cheese sauce and broccoli, mushrooms, crab, panko, and truffle oil. We watched them make our pasta and it took a good 10 minutes, which isn't a long time but seemed excessive given that the pasta they threw into the pan was already cooked. When I got my dish and the pasta was mushy - it was hard to separate the pasta from the sauce, which was super thick. On top that, the entire dish was really fishy. I understand I ordered crab, but it tasted like it was on the edge of being rancid. Not the most pleasant experience. \n\nBut what really turned me off to this place was the fact that they continuously use the same three pans to cook all the pasta orders. The work stations are out in the open so that patrons can watch their orders be assembled and cooked; After I got my order, I watched the cooks use the same pan (without being cleaned) for another order. There were still remnants of my vegan sauce. The new order was not vegan and had cheese, cream, and bacon. I can only assume that the pan used for my order was not cleaned as well. I'm dairy-free and pescatarian by choice, but there are people out there that are hardcore vegans and have actual intolerances. Knowing that they use the same pans and cross contaminate the vegan dishes with the non vegan ones is really disappointing. The establishment itself is new and the staff seems slightly inexperienced. I won't be back, but I hope that this is one of those early lessons they learn quickly and correct this as soon as possible.", "author": "Michelle Q."}

This place definitely comes through in terms of serving up a hot bowl of savory, gooey, cheesy goodness, although it has a couple of minor glitches. The mac itself is solid, choose your shape and sauce and add-ins, I kept it simple with bacon and peas but you can go absolutely crazy with stuff like Cheetos.\n\nAlthough the food is good, the restaurant itself leaves a bit to be desired. On an early weeknight they didn't have a big staff, so the food took a little while since only one woman was doing the cooking. The layout and presentation of things like silverware and condiments seemed scattershot, like they just dumped them wherever there was room. There were also quite a few flies buzzing around, not confidence inspiring, and the place is incredibly spartan, with almost no decoration, like a college dorm room the day you move in before you've hung anything on the walls or bought a comfy chair.\n\nFor a place that only serves one thing, it has potential since everyone loves mac and cheese and theirs is definitely tasty and comes in big portions.

In order to counter the actual progress I am making towards a healthy lifestyle, I decided to stop by here and try it out. Easy 2 hour street parking on Chestnut, most of the time. After a scenic 15 minute walk past quirky markets, gourmet restaurants, and houses I will never be able to afford, I arrived at the restaurant, entering through a whimsical white hallway with the ever-classy quote 'Stay Cheesin.' I stepped up and the guy working the cash register gave me a rundown on the sauces and told me I could add on anything for free unless stated differently. I went with their Goddess sauce (garlicky,) chicken, hot dog, peppers, hot cheetos, and splurged for crab (+$3.) I got my food and dipped out without checking the contents of the bowl. I got back to my car and got going. I opted to eat in the car, allowing me to get a head start on the crippling city traffic. I whipped the little tinfoil dish out and  dug up like an animal. So crispy, yet so creamy and rich. Could have done without the soggy, chewy hot cheetos.  But damnnnnnnn. Then I remembered about the crab I added on. I could clearly see the hot dog and chicken that I ordered, so where the hell was my heavily anticipated crab? I frantically started stabbing at everything that even resembled meat and ramming it in my mouth. No luck. I have a particularly eventful history regarding screwing up orders, for better or for worse. I tried to be angry but the mac was so creamy and mesmerizing and all the flavors blended so perfectly that it was impossible. After inhaling the whole portion, I decided to call MAC'D and tell them about the issue. It wasn't for the measly $3 (although you'd never walk by it if you saw it on the sidewalk,) it was now a matter of principle. Stuck in the stupid city traffic, I talked to the manager, Barbie, who apologized about the mishap. She offered me a free mac next time I swing by. I was gonna take it but then I realized I probably wouldn't back for a few months and I didn't know how reliable \"tell them Barbie said it's free\" was. Like what if I'm there in 6 months stacking my mac with lobster and such running up the tab, telling the cashier that \"Barbie said it's free.\" What if they're like \"who's Barbie lol that'll be $22.47.\" I told her to kindly refund whatever to the card they charged.

But that's just what happened today.\n\nThe cheese sauce and mac is mediocre at best. The toppings (outside of seafood) are \"free and unlimited\" but only because they literally give you minuscule amounts of each. For example, I ordered broccoli and literally had two ridiculously small pieces. Each piece was the size of approximately half a Cheerio. \n\nBUT, the biggest reason why this is one star is because of the service, specifically because of one particular worker. I ordered crab on mine and like the broccoli it was extremely small. It was so small that after 5 minutes of digging around the plate for the crab, I couldn't find it. So I asked the workers where it was. This particular worker took my plate, stuck a fork in it, stuck her nose in it, and was able to find a single piece of small crab. Seriously, the single piece of crab was the size of a pinky nail. Then, she proceeded to eat the piece of crab in front of me and joked about it. When I confronted her, she didn't replace the crab or say sorry. She just walked away. WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS? It completely ruined the mood and experience. \n\nThe workers all seem like they're no older than college freshman. The lack of maturity and professionalism towards me as a paying customer is unacceptable. Fix the service, hire new and better workers, and you'll have a much better restaurant.

It also seemed like it was more cheese itself than a cheese sauce.The portions are HUGE so you could probably share with someone. The service was a little slow and it seems overpriced at $12+ per bowl, but again the portions were huge.", "author": "Allie O."}

NO drinks. Why would you ever open a new restaurant with no drinks? It just makes no sense. And when I asked about water, I was told the water carafes would be \"refilled soon\" as they were all empty. After ordering, we were told to expect our food in 20 minutes - 20 MINUTES! For 2 bowls of macaroni and cheese at a place with 2 types of noodles and 4 sauces on the menu? There is absolutely no excuse for a 20 minute-wait time. I was also extremely turned off by the plastic forks. So I just spent $36 on 2 bowls of mac and cheese and you don't offer me a real fork? Cmon, you can do better. \n\nThe actual mac and cheese was meh - at best. There was no difference in taste from the basic and the tailgate cheeses and the tri tip was really poorly cooked. And while they did not skimp on the lobster, it was nothing special. \n\nWe left hungry. Spicy cheeto toppings will not keep this place open.", "author": "Spencer H."}

I am sure they are working out kinks, but if they take customer feedback they might literally be the only spot that has survived that location. We will go again to see how it goes because this has the potential to be the \"lazy cold rainy SF dinner spot\".\n\nThe interior needs a more \"permanent\" look. The interior design screams temporary. Which may be intentional until they see how it does, but still.\n\nThey ought to make the menu board a bit more...something. There were no descriptions of the sauces visible. I mean I THINK I know what \"Tailgate\" includes, but I have no clue what \"Goddess\" is. It would look better (and be cheap) on chalkboard vs the magnet-looking letters.\n\nLove that you can choose cauliflower instead of pasta.\n\nThe mix ins are great. Wouldn't add anything, wouldn't remove anything. Which leads me to:\n\nThere was almost no broccoli in mine. Yet, mine had some of my husband's jalape\u00f1os in it. Pretty sure they used the same spoon while\ncooking/serving. Very bad for anyone with allergies. Particularly since they serve shellfish. It just needs\nto be standardized. I'd pay a bit extra per mix-in if I actually got a good pasta:mix in ratio.\n\nThis could be because it's new, but very limited beverage options. If you want a sparkling water, a coke or ice in your 4 oz dixie cup, you are out of luck. But if you like coconut water or Snapple you're good.\n\nBrilliant idea. There is nothing else like it on Chestnut or Union and it shares a wall with a Marina bar. BRILLIANT.\n\nMake some tweaks and I think it'll be around awhile.", "author": "Brie P."}

Upon walking in, I can tell this place is very wide and open spaces bc of how high the ceilings were. There are many tables available when I walked in around lunch time & it was slow. They sort of have this build/choose the style you want your mac n cheese. The thing they could really improve on is having the price listed on the wall next to the options. I had no idea what the price would be the whole time I was ordering. I got a classic sauce, elbows, mixed in with chicken/mushroom/broccoli, & topped with panko bread crumbs. They also have hot cheeto dust as one of the options! I decided to sprinkle some of that on mine before digging in. The first anticipated bite was alright. The food literally came right off the pan but it isn't hot??? It was warm which was weird to me. The flavors are okay, they could've been more flavorful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-13", "description": "I went to their soft opening for dinner and was sold on the idea. Mac and cheese is one of those foods that I don't eat very often but when I crave it, I NEED to have it. At MAC'D, what I loved is that I could take something I consider basic comfort food and customize it to whatever I felt like eating that day! \n\nThey let you pick from 4 different cheese sauces--I picked the Frenchie (French onion soup flavored). Then, they even let you pick what type of pasta you want! For those that want mac and cheese but not the carbs, MAC'D even has a roasted cauliflower option. I picked the shell pasta. \n\nYou then choose your toppings, which is where it gets really fun. I had a hard time picking (there were so many good things to choose from!) and the guy at the counter was really helpful with his suggestions. I ended up with chicken, mushroom, banana peppers, and crab. \n\nFinally, you can choose from some other finishings such as Panko and Hot Cheetos. I didn't get any of them as I felt they wouldn't go well with the toppings I had chosen, but I'm looking forward to coming back again and trying Hot Cheetos with my mac and cheese. Everything I picked went well together and I actually finished the entire thing because it was so good. Usually, eating food like this makes me full after a few bites and I'm ready to take a nap afterwards. However, MAC'D manages to balance all the different ingredients super well and I ended up feeling extremely satisfied instead of extremely uncomfortable in a food coma. \n\nBeyond the food and great service, I love the way they have their restaurant set up! I especially like the \"Flavor Station\", where they have a section stocked full of a variety of different hot sauces. Again, really like the theme of letting you pick what you want and deciding what you want to eat in the moment. \n\nOverall, great experience and will definitely come back again soon!", "author": "Jessica C."}

Then when we finally get to the counter to order, we are told they have to wait to take orders so the kitchen can catch up.... our wait time to order was almost 2 hours. I finally ordered, the girl repeated the order so I know it's right. The order comes out wrong (and 30 minutes after I ordered).... I asked for bacon, chorizo, broccoli, and corn. No chorizo at all... a total of 3 pieces of corn. My friend has the goddess sauce with bacon, chicken, broccoli, and peas. No bacon, and a total of 5 pieces of the tiniest piece of chicken we've both ever seen. She said she liked the flavor of hers enough. Mine- didn't even eat half. \nWe also watched people behind us in line get their food, and a side of chicken which they were all confused by.

Yes please! \nI am sad to give this place such few stars but they really need to work out some kinks. \nFirst of all, I read the other yelp reviews that talked about the super long wait. Trying to not wait so long, we ordered online through their website and went to pick up our order. We placed our order at 11:15a to be picked up at 1:30p. We ended up not getting there till almost 2 because of traffic. Anyway, we go in and they tell us that there's no way we ordered because they have online ordering turned off. Thankfully I had the confirmation page on my phone (which showed we had already paid) and the manager put in our order and rushed it. We did end up getting our order in about 10 mins. \nWhile we were waiting to talk to the manager though, we had a front row seat to why the waiting is so incredibly long... \nthe manager is the one taking the orders (at least on this particular day). Super nice guy but he seemed too interested in talking to people and solving problems all over the restaurant than taking orders. He would take someone's order, then run down the line handing out menus, telling people how long the line is, running to get things from the kitchen, asking the bartender how to make a drink, etc. If they hired someone to take orders, the line would be cut at least in half, if not more. I also was concerned about some of the health things I saw in there. The woman working the bar had her long hair down and it kept going in the cups.

The manager was also running back and forth between the kitchen, cash register and menus without washing hands... talk about germs. \n\nPros: The food was so good!!

We started with the tailgate cheesy sauce, shells, bacon, hot dogs (yep!), and Parmesan on top. Then we asked for jalape\u00f1os and broccoli on the side. \n\nThis is where it got fucking weird for a second. Recv'd our order and looked into the box of sides in which the broccoli and jalape\u00f1os were mixed. No biggie and since my girl doesn't eat jalape\u00f1os, figure it was a score for me and I will get another side of broccoli. Asked the girl tossing up the mac n cheese for a new side of broccoli and she was cool about getting me a new side. Waiting at the spot I'm standing at and just watching how they do things, noticed one of the cooks raising up his arms  behind the counter, in the kitchen. Catches my attention and asks, \"everything okay?\" I said, all is good, just need a new side of broccoli, but all is good. So not sure if i misinterpreted the whole interaction, but seemed like I was getting a fucking attitude for asking for a non-mixed side of broccoli?Weird shit, but I'm here for the food, not to deal with stupid bullshit. \n\nSo after getting the broccoli and sitting down, I was able to enjoy the plate at hand. The amount given was enough to feed two people. The taste was great and everything was mixed well. Each bite guaranteed a mushroom, hot dog, or piece of bacon. Sometimes the trifecta. The plate was solid and the amount was plenty. Broccoli was def a must and prob better if added to the mac, rather it being on the side, but to each is their own. \n\nI enjoyed the combo that we had ordered, but next time I know what to do different and with the extras they offer, we already have a combo brewing. \n\nLike I said, we really enjoyed our mac n cheese. Not sure what the hell the issue was about reordering broccoli, but whatever dude. We will be back and ready to enjoy a whole new combo!

So you are coming here to pay $11 for mac and cheese that is average.  Why?  Find a place that serves good mac and cheese and has a broader menu (and maybe even cares about service).  Got a little kid?  Yeah, they love mac and cheese and don't even want it fancy.  $11 for a portion they won't finish, suckers.\n\nWe happened to have strolled in on St. Paddy's Day.  People were out in droves.  There was a line but that's a good thing for a business.  I've never seen a manager or employees spend so much time on their phones when there is a line out the door.  I've never seen so many unused tables when there is a line out the door.  The manager definitely wasn't going to push things through.  When a table did get up and didn't self bus, he'd make the girl behind the register bus it while the line waited.  He wasn't going to ring anyone up or clean anything up.  He clearly was only going to watch.  Order a beer?  Yeah, that got forgotten and I had to ask for it ten minute later (and then wait for more customers to be rung up first).\n\nI do love the fact that at the register they ask you what tip you want to include.  This is for a place that makes you stand in line when there is actually room, get your own flatware, walk up get your own food, ask for your drinks more than once, and asks you to bus your own table.

Good idea, poorly executed.\n1) it's not really build your own Mac'ncheese at all.\nthe same cheese sauce is on all the mac options, and it's a VERY thick sauce that was not smooth at all. It was coagulating on my plate within the first few minutes of being served.  The sauce is peppery and NOT a basic sauce. It had brown, black and red bits in the sauce-- have no idea what's in it, but they should have a cheese option that is just super basic! \n2) the place was DIRTY. I was surprised it was so dirty for such a new place. The floors, chairs, and tables were sticky and gross. The woman behind the counter just sat there and didn't even clean up. We were the only people in the place at 5pm so it wasn't so busy that she couldn't wipe the tables down. \n3) It would have been nice to have some vegetable sides as options. Nope. Just got some brussel sprout \"special\" that were drowned in hot sauce and honey. They could really be successful with a side salad or a side of broccoli since they offer that as a mix in. \n4) the food took a long time to make and we were the only ones there. \n5) I agree with the previous reviewer who said please have silverware instead of plastic for dine-in.

I have kids. Waited 40 minutes just to order. I saw no body with kids because of the stupid line. I'm sorry just make a regular Mac and cheese for like 7-8 guys put the damn thing in a container and put crust on top. Put 10 in every 15 min. Get the line going. Tell everyone it's 3.5 star Mac and cheese if they want 5 starts come back and order in the long line. The owner needs to stop being cheap hire a busser to clean tables and get peoples food out to people. Get drinks for everyone NOT u doing cashier, drinks, and sometimes clean maybe or have your customers clean. Really? Just give another person a job even if it cost u money. Hire them part time call it a day. \n\nBut take my advice please just start a simple Mac and cheese regular yellow orange sauce and elbow noodles and pop them out quick. Have someone come out every 15 minutes let everyone know there's a fast line just for the simple Mac and cheese. Put it all in a bucket and mix it and bake it. Pop it out. This place later on will be a turn off for a long line. No one wants to wait 2 hours for food guys. I'm glad your doing good. \n\nBut accommodating always win long term. Also if you see a line of 10 people open the door before opening. Let everyone know we usually don't open 10 minutes before opening hours but we did it today just for you or something. It's nice that way. Then the 5 stars come even if your food sucks that day.\n\nBut your food 100% good. Wait killed it. After waiting in line. After ordering took another 20-30 min.

I ordered with a variety of toppings including chicken, and when I got my meal, first off the bowl was barely filled. I could see the bottom at multiple places.

The cashier was really nice and explained the different cheeses in each Mac to us. I got a Tailgate Mac with hot cheetos, mushrooms, bacon, and broccoli as sides. My friend got the garlic Mac with crab, broccoli, and mushrooms as sides. Both our dishes came out within 10 minutes which was a plus. \n\nHowever to our surprise while eating our Mac dishes we noticed there didn't seem to be a lot of broccoli. Even worse my friend couldn't find one piece of crab in his dish. So we decided to talk to the servers about the lack of additions in our Mac. \n\nTurns out there actually were pieces of broccoli mixed into our Mac that we found after searching thorougly but not what you would expect. There were 2-3 pieces of broccoli that were the size of a person's fingertip. My friend received extremely unprofessional service from what appears to be one of the cooks in which she first sniffed his Mac for crab and then she took a fork and rummaged through his Mac looking for crab pieces.\n\nTo our amazement she found A crab piece (a small one mind you) and she had the nerve to hold it up in the light with her fork and then proceed to eat it right in front of us. She even smiled at us afterwards to appear even more rude to us. \n\nConsidering that my friend paid $3 for crab as a side and only had ONE piece of crab that the cook ate in front of us, this restaurant deserves a one star. I recommend avoiding this place because not only are the sides misproportioned, the Mac is mediocre, and most importantly, a place that hires staff who eat a customer's food directly in front of them speaks a lot about quality control. \n\nI hope this place gets better because there aren't that many Mac places in SF.

Let me start with the unsanitary food preparation.  The cooks handled nearly all the add-ins with their bare hands.  Now that would not be so bad except that they moved between the food prep to the front area where they handle multiple items touched by multiple people then return to the food prep to once again grab crab, onions, bacon bits, etc out of plastic containers with bare hands without washing their hands.  Next they do not wash the saute pans between orders, thus, mixing flavors and creating crusty bits from multiple uses that end up in your meal.  When I sent back my meal to have it prepared in asking that the cooks and sue-cooks (not Chefs by any stretch of the imagination) wear gloves, the sue-cook went to the storage area and came out wearing a pair of yellow cleaning gloves like you would wear to wash your dishes.\n\nI love Mac & Cheese and have been wanting to try this place since I moved to the neighborhood 6 mos ago...

The window had a very unpleasant odor of urine. It was quite unbearable and was strong enough to surround the whole front area of the restaurant. My friend and I chose to sit in the back to avoid the smell.\nThe food was ok, but after a little over an hour I began to feel nauseous and had a very bad stomach ache.

It is nice to have something in the neighborhood open until 2am other than pizza or Mels. The only ding for a star was the time it takes to make the mac n cheese. We were lucky to beat the crowd before the bars let out and still waited over 15 minutes. They should have a more assembly line style production for the late night take out.  The 20 people who came after us must have waited much longer because there are not enough cooks in the kitchen at that time.  Overall, the food was A+. Recommendation: The Goddess (garlic cheese), with bacon, crab, truffle oil, and panko crumbs on top. And don't forget the flavor bar for a splash of siracha.

There was one small piece of crab in it, which I paid an extra $3 for, and way more bacon then anything else I added. I wish the would balance the add ons in it. While eating it I wish there was for flavor to it, the cheese was pretty lacking too. There was barely any mushrooms, but there were loads of bacon.

Mac'd is an awesome new restaurant that bring a Chipotle-style approach to the tried and true favorite Mac and Cheese. I've had two different macs so far; the Goddess (Garlic Cheddar) and the Tailgate (Mushroom and Bacon fat). Both are awesome but the Goddess is definitely my favorite. Aside from the flavor, you can choose all the toppings you want, as many as you want. I personally added bacon, corn, mushrooms and crushed hot cheetos, which was flipping awesome, and the choices mean your flavor experience can be fully customized and changed for every visit. Add to that two friendly owners, staff, and a convenient location, you'll enjoy Mac'd food every time (although you might need to start your treadmills ;) )", "author": "Ben S."}

I've been following the Mac'd crew since they were aspiring restaurateurs with pop-up shops all around SF. Watching them grow has been very inspiring. It seems like every time I go back there's something new about the place which makes each new visit worth while. Even then, you can't go wrong with the tried-and-true classics! Lines are always out the door so plan accordingly, but I think it's worth it! At least there's a charming neon \"Stay Cheesin'\" sign you can snap a selfie with while you wait. Pretty sure I've tried all their sauces and so far my favorite is the pesto. I'd also highly recommend panko or hot cheetos (or both!!) to give your mac some added texture variety. They have an excellent hot sauce selection to spice up you dishes if that's your thing. Oh man, writing this review is making me crave their new fried chicken mac...brb...", "author": "Raymond K."}

They had a sign apologizing for the wait, they didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen, but our food was out in less than 10 mins, if that!

My wife had seen it on the internet and has been bugging me to come here for about a week, an hour of traffic there and back; thought it would be worth it. We were asked if it was our first time and we said yes, the girl at the front was really nice and helped us out and we were hella excited to try the hot Cheeto topping. Anyway, we ordered and sat down and oh we even ordered fries which were really tasty. I was half way with my Mac n cheese when my wife looked at my plate and pulled out this LONG ASS piece of hair!! It couldn't have been mine because I had my hair up AND it was baked into the Mac n cheese!! We were gonna order another plate to go so we brought it up to the girl that we found a hair and she responded with, \"yeah that happens sometimes\" and we gave her this like crazy look.. so she offered to take a couple bucks off of our to go order, well didn't I think that was appropriately because I was planning to take my other half to go so she gave us another free plate to go. I feel like it could've been handled better and this place is super hyped it doesn't even meet up to its expectations.. I suggest you lookout. \"They wear hair hats\" but clearly they're not careful enough to keep their hair out of our food.", "author": "Shaylia M."}

After I order hers, I am told that they don't have cauliflower mac'n cheese (which directly opposes their menu).  So, instead of eating there, I get takeout for my daughter and nothing for me (I don't like restaurants that place things on their menu, but don't really have them).\n\nMy daughter loved what she had, and gave it a 5.  She had the plain Mac 'n Cheese (they seem to have many options - of which many appear very tasty with the different additions you can add, I would have loved to have tried it).  So, her part of the rating is \"5\" and my disappointment for not having something advertised on the menu gets this place a \"1\".\n\nWe may come back as we live in the neighborhood, but with a low carb diet, I don't know if the menu fits my lifestyle without the cauliflower offering.", "author": "Paul D."}

I have no idea why it was so empty, this was some of the best mac and cheese I've had in years, and everyone in my party had a good experience. One of us has some pretty specific food allergies, and finding a new place for them to eat can be challenging, so the fact that they are able to make things dairy free/gluten free/garlic free/pepper free was huge. He ended up getting the roasted cauliflower with just olive oil instead of cheese, and there were actually several proteins and toppings he could have.

If you looked closely, there was even dust floating in the air and settling into the food. I had somewhat high expectations for the mac n' cheese but it turned out to be quite disappointing. The quality isn't worth the money you pay for. It wasn't anything special and I could have easily made it at home. I think I would have at least left with a better impression if the place was kept clean. I could tell it was a lazy day for the workers.

My excitement was met with a garlic sauce that was simply lacking garlic!  The amount of cheese was great except that we all independently commented that it was somehow gritty in texture which was overall only slightly unappealing considering just how cheesy the dish was. I discovered how amazing chorizo goes in Mac n Cheese so that was a definite plus. My biggest concern was simply the presentation. For $40+ dollars for three Mac n Cheese's without the extras, serving it in something more than tinfoil to-go dishes with a focus on presentation would have yielded a better response.
