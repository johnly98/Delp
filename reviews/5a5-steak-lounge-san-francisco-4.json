Nice decor and a very intimate setting with the dim lights. It was not super busy but because it is small, all the conversations made for the room to be a little loud. Noise level wasn't unbearable, one could still have a comfortable conversation.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and professional. He definitely knew his information when presenting the wagyu platter to us (what they claim to be most known for). The other gentleman who came to serve our sides were really kind as well, I appreciated the fact that they explained each plate.\n\nNow, the food. We ordered the Yakimono Shrimp as an appetizer, 20000/10 recommend! These were absolutely delicious!! A MUST HAVE!! We also had the bone-in ribeye & filet mignon with asparagus and mac n' cheese as sides. Ribeye was good, SUPER chewy and not much to it. Filet mignon was DELICIOUS. The pur\u00e9e just made it 1000x's better! And both the asparagus and mac n' cheese were \"eh\". Nothing mouthwatering.\n\nI had called to inform them that we were celebrating a birthday and after dinner, they brought out a little plate with a small brownie and strawberry jelly of some sort. A nice gesture to end our dinner date.\n\nAll in all, a really nice experience. Knocking down 1 star because I believe certain items (food) could have been a little better/flavorful for the price we paid.", "author": "Karina R."}

The food was excellent; started off with oysters per usual... And they were legit. \n\nAnd of course I went with the NY strip for the main which was delicious. I don't recall what I did for the sides, but I recall them being tasty. And then at one point the manager came out to check on us.

Upon arrival around 615pm, place was still pretty empty. We hung out and got drinks at the bar before heading into the private room. After seating, we were immediately serviced with drink requests. Our waiter came out with a platter of 4 cuts of wagyu and explained the difference between them: the marbling, fat content, what degrees they cook the meat at, etc. \n\nShort intro later, we were served platters of bread and a small dish of chef's complimentary tuna fish. We ordered appetizers: Shishito Peppers, Seafood Croquette, Poke, and Shigoku Oysters. All were super delicious but the highlight of the night was of course the WAGYU. The waiter bought us out a palate cleanser which is an orange gelee with white chocolate crema. \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the A5 Wagyu Filet 4oz. It came well presented and the first bite was the most heavenly, softest, buttery meat I have ever tasted! I had Kobe beef in Japan which was good but this tops it. I can not rave enough about the wagyu here! Because of this restaurant, my taste buds will never be the same. No steak I have ate after this will even top or compare! To make things interesting, I was also given a certificate of authenticity to show where my cow origins, it's birthday, age of harvest, etc. My moo moo's name is Hideakira.\n\nOther notable side dishes were the creamy spinach, truffled Mac & cheese and Brentwood corn. \n\nService was on par for the whole 2.5 hours. Drinks and water was never empty. As someone who doesn't drink alcohol, the waiter insisted the bar make me 2 non-alcoholic drinks. The transition between all the courses was smooth.

I would've only gotten the filet and ribeye if we come back.\n- Truffled Mac & Cheese: good\n- Shrooms: good\n\nWe ended up having to box the sides since we can't finish everything.

(I'm the type that'll go to a burger shop I've never been to and get the most generic burger on the menu because if they mess up a simple cheeseburger, then their other burgers are probably not worth ordering).\n\nMy wife and I decided to check this place out over a weekday for dinner (we figured parking would be easier since the restaurant didn't offer valet parking) and with our reservation in hand, were promptly seated immediately to our table. The vibe and mood of the restaurant was modern and like their names suggests, lounge-like. The interior was a bit too loud with moody, color lights bouncing off the walls and ceiling.\n\nWe ended up getting the ribeye and filet mignon. Honestly, they weren't that great, or even good. The ribeye was way too big. I'd rather pay that same amount for a much smaller chunk of ribeye. The flavors were quite honestly just all over the place. Can't pinpoint if it was trying to be a traditional steak, fusion, Japanese, or maybe the ingredients got swapped halfway through making it. It was same for the filet mignon as well. My wife and I have had both A5 steaks and regular steaks in Japan so we did have somewhat of a point of reference when tasting our foods.\n\nThe side dishes were also very underwhelming. The best item I did have that dinner was the mac and cheese with bacon. That was really delicious (if not a bit too greasy but hey, bacon).\n\nService was decent but the wait staff seemed a bit understaffed that night. Slower than what I was expecting from a dinner that costs a few hundred dollars with raving reviews.\n\nI had made reservations with a note that it was our wedding anniversary but they made no mention or effort into making the night special. I noticed the table next to us that had ordered the 5A5 Experience was getting multiple staff members waiting on them along with desserts, extras on the house. \n\nWith a pretty disappointing evening overall, I doubt I'd be back, even if I was craving A5 steaks. This definitely wasn't our style when it came to the way the steaks are made and the atmosphere of the place. But this is just my opinion.\n\nIf I could make a suggestion to the restaurant, I'd suggest getting rid of all the items that weren't A5 items (except sides, etc). If that's what they're known for and what they're trying to sell to their customers, then do a great job in making that experience and meal amazing. Don't half ass the orders that come in for something they obviously view as \"second class\".\n\nWait: Reservations recommended\nPrice: $100+ per person\nParking: Limited timed street or paid garage parking", "author": "Pourio L."}

The apps-scallops, wagyu sliders were good.

They aren't as hyped up as the other steakhouses in the city, and after my experience, I now understand why. \n\nFirst off, they had many open tables in the main dining room area, but the hostess wanted to seat us in a dimly lit section located in the back. My boyfriend requested a table in the main area and was told those were reserved for bigger parties (aka a party of 4, we had a party of 3). Since we weren't in a rush, we decided to wait for a table to clear. The hostess accommodated to our request and sat us in the main room within 10 minutes. During our meal, I noticed that those empty tables were never even filled. \n\nWe shared the hamachi appetizer, which came with a bunch of random sauces and purees. The flavors didn't really mix well, I felt like there was too much going on. I got the filet mignon for my main entree. I chose medium rare and it arrived more on the rare side, which is my preference anyways. The meat was juicy and tender! \n\nWe also got sides to share: \nthe truffle mac + lobster tail - very strong truffle taste \nmushrooms - my favorite side!\nasparagus - oily, nothing special \nsweet potato gnocchi - I thought this was too sweet, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it\n\nOverall, the food was good but nothing spectacular. The service was also just OK, which sucks because when you're paying a good amount of money, you expect good service.

Which is a problem because my wallet won't let me eat like this everyday! This is definitely a \"treat yourself\" type of place for me, but it was worth every penny.\n\nThe A5 Wagyu filet was sooo tender, it basically melted in my mouth. Apparently these cows get massages and listen to classical music all day? I can tell. They were very relaxed and tender. We also tried the Tajima (50% A5) filet which was also very delicious, although not quite as tender. \n\nThe foie gras was equally incredible. The crispy toast underneath it absorbed all the butter and fat, adding a slight crunchy texture. All the flavors were well balanced and succulent. \n\nFinally, the truffle mac and cheese was a must have. I appreciate that they gave us little palette-cleanser spoons along the way, which really helped when you're eating all these savory, fatty dishes. \n\nOur server was attentive and friendly. He even brought out the cuts of beef for us too look at before we ordered. I appreciate that this place doesn't have the busy/loud vibe of some of the other more popular steak houses in SF.

The grand dining area is open with high ceilings. Or as the lady up front called it \"it's our flying saucer\"\n\nWe were seated promptly and received service after a few minutes.

Cocktails $15, wine $14+. I ordered The McAllan 12 and then a Cab with dinner.  \n\nWe ordered the Lobster Tempura, 2 tails came with shiitake sauce. We liked it..juicy, flavorful, not fishy, and Delish.\n\nFor entree we shared the 32 oz Bone-in Ribeye with a side of Shrooms. The steak was more than enough for 2. The steak was cooked to our liking, it was more medium and borderline medium rare near the bone , and more cooked on the perimeter. Luckily I liked the medium so it worked out fine. We loved it.\n\nA third person appeared who I think was the manager, and helped out here and there. \n\nThere was a bit confusion on the flow of things.

I am always a big fan of Bordeaux wine.\nThe first sip amazed me when he opened the half bottle(shows it's a perfect time to drink as soon as it's opened, but which doesn't always mean it's a good thing), it fell apart after 15 mins, before my steak got here, super super sad! All the flavors of Margeaux is inside the wine: Chocolate, cedar, mineral, jam; but the structure/ the bone/the tannin is missing, the acid is stronger than the tannin, so it's unbalanced; all the flavor+lack of bone= floppy. I feel so sad to pay $105 for this wine, which does not worth the price at all.\n\nThe service was not good either, I tried to talk the Somm about the wine, but he never came back, n asked the server to grab him, we waited for 20 mins after we signed the check, he didn't come still. I really wanted to talk to the Somm before I leave :(\n\nThe crossbreed Steak here is pretty good, this one star is for the Steak. The bread is nothing impressive either.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

Their food has definitely changed for the better. \n\nService: the service was very  slow in the beginning. We literally had to wait 15 mins just to get our menus and we also had to ask another server to bring our waiter back to take our order down. So minus 1 star for that\n\nFood\n\nTruffle fries: 4/5 perfectly crisp and served with a side of a mild spice aioli. I just wished they put more truffle oil on this, because you can barely taste is. I would definitely order this if you're craving something starchy and crispy.\n\nHamachi sashimi: 5/5 omg this was delicious! They give you an option of either sashimi style or served on spoon. This dish is topped with uni with a hint of citrus ponzu. (Sashimi served with 6 for 24, spoon is 5 each)\n\nFoie gras: 4/5 duck liver toast is super good, and they perfectly seared the foie gras. The brioche bun to foie gras was a perfect combination. However, I did not like the sauce that they had served on the side with this dish, which is a minus 1.\n\nNY strip steak: 3/5 I liked this dish but it just didn't wow me.. I also wish that there was a little more sauce to the steak..\n\nSous vide salmon: 5/5 this was my favorite entree dish actually. Salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. This dish was served with carrots, and Brussels sprouts on a bed of spaghetti squash.\n\nCauliflower: 2/5 ehh.. this wasn't bad but it wasn't great..  I really don't think this is worth your money, save your money for something else on the menu.\n\nTruffle Mac and cheese: 4/5 *warning* EXTREMELY CHEESY which I love!!! This is a definite!\n\nMashed potatoes: 3/5 I like my mash more on the salty side, but this one was a little too sweet for my palette...\n\nAll in all I had a good time eating at 5A5, I just wish their service was a little faster.", "author": "Elsa W."}

Not worth the expense\n\nLobster tempura - really delicious and excellent preparation.  Hard to go wrong with fried lobster.  Good portion size.\n\nScallops - great basic dish.  Well executed.  \n\nIceberg salad - needs more blue cheese tang.  Otherwise it's a sad iceberg and ranch salad.  \n\nFilet mignon - delicious and prepared correctly.  \n\nSides - creamed spinach was the stand-out. \n\nDessert- sorbet, creme brulee and something else.

I made a reservation for 1, and requested to sit near light.  The host and hostess were wonderful and super helpful/attentive.  When the waiter placed two settings in front of me, the host came by and apologized and took the extra setting away.  \n\nI started with the Hamachi spoon (uni, pickled seaweed, strawberry - kimchi furikake, aji ceviche, and ponzu) and the Tuna spoon (meyer lemon puree, garlic-horseradish puree, soy poached daikon, fried ginger, and micro red shisho).  Both of these were good and only $5 -- definitely worth it.  The presentation on the curled metal spoons is really beautiful and unique.  I would recommend these.  For both of these you can either get the spoon or an actual plate which includes 5 bites.  \n\nI then ordered the \"Shigoku Oysters\" -YIKES.  I have never had oysters I hated until last night.  They have sauerkraut, seaweed, kohlrabi, horseradish lime mignonette, and crisp kale.  Honestly, I couldn't even eat it.  I had to force myself to give it a few more tries, until finally I gave up and just left it.  It was incredibly salty/sour to the point where I couldn't even control my reaction.  I would NOT recommend this dish.  Honestly, not good at all.  \n\nI then tried the Foie Gras, which was good.  This is served with brioche, candied kumquats, pernod reduction, fennel pollen, daikon sprouts, and aji-avocado sauce.  The presentation of this dish was beautiful and it was one of the better tasting items I had.  I wouldn't say I would come back for it -- but if you're here I'd recommend it.  \n\nLastly, I ordered the Lobster Bisque.  No.  No, no no.  I'm from New England, I know my lobster bisque -- and this was not good.  The color was bizarre, and the taste was just not right.  The bisque itself did not taste like lobster.  I didn't eat it and another waitress (not my own), noticed and took it off the bill for me -- which I really appreciated.  \n\nNow for the part that made me the most angry:  This place stays open till 10pm.  I got there at 8:15.  Around 9:00pm the waiter asks me \"if I'm going to order anything else.\"  Then like 5 minutes later came by again and said \"the kitchen is asking if you're going to order anything else because our last reservation of the night just sat down.\"  WTF?!  Yall are open for another hour and there's plenty of other people who literally just sat down.  So rude, and I felt singled out.  \n\nOverall, this place left such a bad taste in my mouth.  Food is not worth the trip.  My waiter made me feel like he wanted me to leave.  The decor is not as cool as the photos online -- it's way older and outdated in person.  I would NOT recommend.

I didn't have a lot of expectations for 5A5 but all I can say is that I was blown away by the creativity and quality of food. \n\nFor starters, we shared a Dungeness Crab Salad. I could definitely see the Asian influence and it was great.\n\nFor entrees, he decided to go all out: 15 ounce prime rib ($39), 32 ounce bone-in rib eye ($68), and 8 ounces of A5 wagyu rib cap ($280). I certainly don't want to sound unappreciative but I think we would've been fine with 4 ounces of wagyu ($140) and I would've happily spent the other $140 some other time.\n\nI love meat and out of the items we ordered, the rib eye was my favorite. It had a good ratio of fat and lean meat and the bone added extra flavor. The piece was huge!\n\nThe prime rib was also surprisingly good. The au jus certainly made the difference. The price difference between a 10 ounce cut and a 15 ounce cut is minimal so I advise you to pay the extra here.\n\nFor our wagyu steak, I thought the rib cap was the prettiest looking out of all of the cuts since it's presented like a flower. The meat was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth-soft. I do think that toward the end, it felt a bit rich for me. This was a much better cut than the Australian wagyu (I know, not a fair comparison) that I had at Alexander's Steakhouse recently. \n\nWe balanced the meats with a side of creamy spinach. Yum!

This was the first time I have ever tried authentic wagyu steak.  When I asked the server which steak he recommended he started out by saying he doesn't recommend getting the wagyu AND the normal steak.  Because once you try the wagyu the normal steaks just don't compare.  But of course I didn't take his word for it and ordered ribeye steak and the wagyu ribeye.  I first tried the regular ribeye and it was juicy, tender and cooked perfectly.  By the way this steak is huge and you can easily share it with two people.  Then I took a bite out of wagyu and drooooooooool.  The meat just melted in my mouth like butter.  I could literally chew it up with my tongue and roof of my mouth.  It was that tender.  The server was right, after eating both the normal ribeye started to become tasteless.  We also ordered a bunch of the side dishes and appetizers, all A+.\n\nRestaurant has an intimate setting with a modern look to it.  Reminds me of a lot of places in Vegas.  Great place to take a date and impress her but be prepared to drop some racks.", "author": "Ted Y."}

Came in with a reservation and was seated right away.   \n \nThe server went over the menu and showed off the Wagyu steaks.

I told them mango (to which I have a severe allergy - I'll come back to this at the end). \n\nFor an appetizer had the lobster.  Yum.  So good.  It's been on the menu since they started 9 years ago.  \n\nChose some Wagyu ribeye and T bone for comparison.   The 4 oz Wagyu was delicious.   So tender and so buttery.  T bone grilled to perfection as well.

From the atmosphere to the staff to the food everything was excellent. All of the dishes I ordered were just absolutely delicious. The edamame's here were the best I've tasted thus far with the mixture of sweet and spicy was a perfect match. They serve you a palate cleanser really, that's too fancy but I'm too fancy so it matched my fancy lol. But, on a serious note the prime rib was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right which is very impressive to me because most fancy steak restaurants the food and steak is bland but at 5A5 Steak Lounge nothing was bland every dish flavorful.

We made an easy reservation though opentable for a Saturday night dinner. We ended up ordering 2 glasses of prosecco, truffle fries, 2 hamachi spoons, a t-bone, 15oz prime rib, and truffle mac and cheese to share.\n\nOur waiter Chris brought out a complimentary bread basket with their bacon bread and sourdough, along with 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary--so nice! We couldn't get enough of the bacon bread. Next came an amuse bouche from the chef: seared ahi tuna with wasabi aioli and ponzu. Loved it, especially cause it was free, hehe! Next up came the hamachi spoons and truffle fries. We tried the hamachi spoons and these were small, but really tasty as well. I liked the combo of flavors paired with the hamachi. Not sure if it's worth the $5, but still very good. I could've ate a whole plate! The truffle fries came with a sriracha aioli in a large basket! We ended up finishing these and being prettty stuffed... They were really addicting with the aioli! I wish they came alongside the steak so I could pace myself eating, but that's no one's fault lol. We got another amuse bouche and it was black currant jelly/jam I believe? \n\nFinally, the steak!!!! The t-bone came with bacon jam and a sous vide egg. I lovee bacon jam so this was my favorite of the two. The t-bone was also cooked to a perfect medium rare! The prime rib was also really nice and juicy. I regret getting the 15oz cut because I was so full after the truffle fries, haha! The truffle mac and cheese was very creamy and had a strong truffle flavor, but the truffle sort of overpowered the cheese. Luckily, I love truffle haha!\n\nFor dessert, our waiter brought out a complimentary piece of chocolate cake for us. It was small, but the perfect ending to our meal because we were both stuffed!

The next course was the steak and I ordered the New York Strip 4 oz and the meat was fantastic and done perfectly to medium rare like I like it, but the sauce they put on it was overpowering and I had to scrap most of it off the steak.

Unfortunately, the stellar hospitality ended here.\n\nWe were seated at our table with no greeting for quite some time. Eventually, some guy who I assume was a beverage manager/sommelier type stopped by to ask if anyone had stopped by and if he could open our wine that we had brought along with us. What followed was awkward conversation about the varietal of wine and something about how he didn't know why he'd been seeing so much of it recently. The whole transaction was a little off, \"Just so you know, we charge $30 to pop that.\" maybe he'd been bitten in the butt by it before but my feeling is that people who know you can bring wine into a restaurant expect a corkage fee in line with what they might expect the bill to run.

He apologized that the server was \"busy\" with some other things but he made up for it on his part. Personally, if a manager saw a sever struggling to keep up with his tables and they personally jumped in themselves to help the customer out, 5/5 service hands down.

Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted and asked if we had a reservation. We were asked kindly to wait in the lounge portion of the restaurant as they prepared our table. We sat down and the waiter explained the menu to us. What's different is that they brought out a cutting board with the different cuts of meat to show you the size and marbling. \n\nFor the appetizer, I ordered the shigoku oysters and those were the highlight of the dish. Each bite held so much flavor and you could taste the different ingredients, it was amazing. We also ordered the lobster tempura and it was very delicious as well. The tempura was crisp, but the lobster meat was kept moist and was not dry. The dipping sauce was light and maintained the integrity of the flavors without being too overpowering. For the main entree, I had the 8 oz filet mignon and my guest had the bone in rib eye. The roasted garlic sauce and parsley on the filet was tasteful and really paired well with the steak. I did enjoy the peppercorn sauce on the rib eye more. The rib eye is 32 oz so don't be frightened when the dish comes out with a huge piece of meat on it. \n\nWhat I appreciated about this restaurant is that they provide palette cleansers between appetizer, entree, and complimentary dessert.

We weren't too hungry so we decided to do family style - we ordered the truffle fries, shigoku oysters, burrata salad, 3 hamachi spoons, the bone in rib eye, and a side of truffled mac n cheese. \n\nThe truffle fries were pretty normal, but then again truffle fries are pretty hard to mess up. The oysters were definitely not worth it. They should probably just stick with regular oysters with no toppings - all the toppings overpowered the flavor of the oysters. Oh, and also we were told there were 6 oysters to an order - we got 5. So not sure if we were misinformed or given one less oyster. The burrata salad was pretty normal, a lot of big pieces of tomato and a decent amount of burrata. The hamachi spoons weren't bad either - I'd recommend getting these.\n\nNow onto the \"steak\". We ordered medium rare and the steak was a mix of medium rare and medium. Granted it was a huge piece of steak, so understandable that it would be impossible to cook the whole piece evenly. The quality of the steak was  SO BAD though. It was such a thick piece and it was so dry, tasteless, tough, and impossible to chew. Between the 3 of us we didn't even want to finish the steak since it was so hard to cut. My fingers hurt so much from trying to cut into the steak - never have I had such a horrible piece of steak. Needless to say we left more than half the steak uneaten since it just wasn't worth it.\n\nLast but not least was the truffled mac n cheese. Nothing to write home about and was pretty decent.\n\nWe didn't order dessert because we were over it all after the steak.\n\nThen here's the kicker, not only can they not get their steaks right, but they also can't get their bills right. Between the 3 of us it was around $90 each, but when I checked my bank statement they charged me $200! I called my bank to dispute the charge, but come on - at least bill correctly. I would have given this place 3 stars if it wasn't for them charging me over double than what I have on my receipt.\n\nSave your time and money - just don't come here. But if you do, just order appetizers or something.", "author": "Megan K."}

While everything was good, I wasn't blown away by any particular thing I ordered, which included Wagyu sashimi, edamame, asparagus with quail eggs, mushrooms, and the prime rib. I also had a chance to taste the filet - my wife ordered it - which was very tasty, but again, wouldn't call it the best filet I've ever had. The best part was, hands down, the drinks. I forget what my drink was called (\"Smoke\" something), but it was great!\n\nI also wasn't blown away by the service. In fact, the service was quite poor. Maybe it's because it started out so great and then just went downhill from there. When we arrived, we sat at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender was extremely friendly! At just about the same time our drinks were ready, so was our table, so I asked him for the check. He refused and said both drinks were on him and he hopes we enjoy our experience. I've never had two expensive cocktails comped, especially when it was the only thing we ordered. Wow! That dude should get a raise! \n\nOnce we sat down, though, things changed. We sat there for a bit without anyone acknowledging us until finally someone - who I assume was a manager - came over, said hello, and told us he would get us some menus. Our server came over, sort of introduced himself, and handed us said menus. The same trend continued throughout the meal... he'd rarely come back to check on us... water glasses were empty more times than full... it was fine, but not the level of service I'd expect at a place like this, especially after the amazing service at the bar. The server did his job, but that was about it.\n\nIf you're still reading... I guess I recommend trying this place out. The food was good albeit expensive (which I knew going in).

After traveling through SoCal and the Bay for delectable hunks of meat, my girlfriend and I are now a bit spoiled. We've have amazing wagyu from CUT, perfectly seared ribeyes from ink., and fantastic aged jewels from Nick and Stef's. 5A5 will present you with a fine hunk of meat, without doubt, but the filet mignon will be slightly too tenderized, and the T-bone will be over-sauced, as many Yelpers have mentioned. If you can, order your steaks with the sauces on the side to enjoy the full taste of that delectable cut of beef. Otherwise, enjoy a fine meal. It's not like the bacon jam garnishes are too heavy, but a steak, when perfectly cooked, is excellent on its own. You don't need to try to improve an already beautiful thing, especially by putting a soft-boiled egg on top of it.\n\nSides that are a must include the truffle mac and cheese (holy Hannah, the truffle flavor pops) and hot scallops (technically an appetizer). The squid ink pasta that comes with these two perfectly seated pieces of seafood is complemented well with the pur\u00e9e at the bottom of everything. To finish, the banana bread is a moist, yet crisp chunk of heaven. Some people have mentioned that service is weak here, but we were carefully watched over the whole time and served beautifully.

Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal if it were a restaurant like Cheesecake Factory...but when you're paying 5A5 prices, you would expect much better service! When we left, there were two hostesses standing at the desk. Neither said \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\". \n\nFood: 4 stars\nThe food is what makes up for it. The Edamame and Truffle fries were the perfect appetizers to order! Edamame was delicious. We ordered the massive Bone-In Ribeye and it was huge!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-06", "description": "Five stars with the information in this Yelp review, four without it.\n\nWait, what?  There's information so valuable in this review that a $400 meal for two is 5 stars with that information and only 4 otherwise?  Read on.\n\nI'm one of those steak geeks obsessed with finding the richest, fattiest cuts.  I used to cook Wagyu myself, but as I'm now married to a pescatarian I mostly eat steak out.  (Which reminds me: if you're cooking beef yourself, hit Bryan's in Laurel Heights for imported Wagyu from Japan.)  I'd heard about 5A5's legendary wagyu beef imports but never tried them before largely due to cost.  But cost wasn't going to interfere this time because this was my birthday meal.\n\nBeing a taste test obsessed person I wanted to try as many things as I could without overeating.  Turns out, 5A5 has small portions (4 oz) of their wagyu selections, which were New York, tenderloin, ribeye, and ribeye cap.  The waiter brought out a \"presentation\" of these options in their uncooked form so we (okay, I) could have a look before deciding.  The NY and ribeye were visually indistinguishable, and the ribeye cap looked just as fatty but had to be \"formed\" into a steak shape since it is composed of the fairly thin ribbons that make up the outside edge of a ribeye.  To my surprise, the tenderloin did not appear much fattier than a USDA prime steak.  All four options cost within 5% of each other ($150-158) and the discount for ordering 8 oz instead of 4 oz was also only about 5%, which in my mind encourages sampling a few.   The menu had a large box right in the middle showing not one but two sets of steak offerings: the A5 wagyu cuts I just mentioned, and also F1 \"Tajima\" hyrbid wagyu/holstein cuts, which were NY and filet, and priced a bit less than half of the wagyu prices.  Note that, per ounce, this is still hundreds of percent more expensive their other steak options outside the menu \"box.\"  Since I wanted to see if the hybrid could compare with the wagyu, and the wagyu filet didn't look that special visually, process of elimination led to the Wagyu NY and the Tajima NY.  Which we ordered.\n\nLet me tell you.  That $150 4 oz of wagyu NY is the real f*cking deal.  It's as good as what I've had in Japan and what I've cooked myself from Bryan's, which means it's worth the trip here if you've never had wagyu and don't want to book a flight to try it.  The hybrid, on the other hand, was just a good NY steak, probably about USDA prime quality.  A good steak that was $65 for 4 oz meaning there is no rational reason to order it instead of the bone-in ribeye just a few inches higher on the menu, which is 8 times the size (yes really) for about the same price.\n\nA few notes on the steaks.  If you order appetizers (which you should because some of them are amazing) 4 oz of wagyu really is enough steak after that.  I know it sounds crazy, but it's insanely fatty like foie gras or the richest part of a ribeye and 4 oz of wagyu is like 4 oz of frosting.  Also note that each of the wagyu preparations offers different \"toppings\" on the steak - truffle cheese on the NY wagyu, truffle sauce and mushrooms on the ribeye wagyu, and tomatoes on the NY Tajima for example - and not all were successful.  The NY wagyu was so rich as it was that I wound up removing the cheese (fortunately this was possible) to avoid overkill.  The Montalena red wine recommended by our server Jake was all that steak needed as accompaniment.  I wound up wishing we'd ordered some potatoes or vegetables with the steak (rather than the mushrooms and mac n cheese which were genuinely great) because you really need something to pad a steak so fatty.  Here's a suggestion: the restaurant should just give you a dollop of perfect mashed potatoes whenever you order a $150 cut.  \n\nAnyway, about those sides and appetizers.  There were a couple amuses bouche.  The first was an odd twist on prosciutto plus melon, and the second, a cranberry jello based palette cleanser, was more successful.  The squid ink scallops appetizer was easily my second favorite dish - the savory squid ink and tons of butter ensured the success of that one - and my wife really liked the lobster bisque soup.  She praised it for being seafoody without that seafood funk, and for its intense richness.   I probably would've agreed had I not just filled my mouth with wagyu beef.  We ordered the truffle fries like Yelp says you should, but the portion was way too big for two people; we had to stop to avoid being too full for entrees but we sort of failed, and some of the fries were too dry.\n\nHad we ordered perfectly, (squid ink, wagyu, vegetables, half order of fries, and a glass of Montalena) I'd call it 5 stars no question.   All things considered, it's a good and expensive 4 with impeccable service.", "author": "Aaron M."}

Our reservation was at 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. \n\nWe ordered bone-in rib eye, prime rib, A5 rib cap wagyu, chicken, and the salmon -- sides: truffle fries, cream spinach, and shrooms. We simply wanted to try a bit of everything. To our surprise, it took an hour before our food came out because we ordered chicken. DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN. Our waitress informed us that it takes them an hour to slow roast the chicken. By the time our food did come out the table next to us nearly finished their dinner, paid and left before us. The odd thing is, they were seated and placed their food order after our table. \n\nMeanwhile, as our food finally arrived the rib eye was no longer hot (barely warm, but very chewy). The prime rib was mediocre, while the chicken and salmon was basic. However, I will have to say the A5 rib cap wagyu was delicious and so were the truffle fries! hands down the truffle fries were pretty good, best I've had. After we finished dinner, we were definitely ready for the check, since we spent too much time in that restaurant... We received a complimentary piece of brownie cake, it was tiny when you compare it to other fine dine restaurants that would give you a complimentary dessert (such as Gary Danko, who also send you home with complimentary treats on your birthday). \n\nAlthough, the wait to get our food was pretty long, our waitress was nice and friendly. \n\nWhat our table did appreciate was when a miscommunication occurred with the type of wagyu we ordered the restaurant took it back. The manager of course came to check on our table to see if we were satisfied due to the miscommunication. I wished the manager would have paid attention to the fact that we sat at the table empty handed for a pretty long time. Although it takes about 45 minutes for the restaurant to cook the bone in rib eye because that thing is huge, tables who sat down and ordered after us (ordering similar menu items) received their meals before us. At one point, our-waitress stopped making eye contact with our table each time she walked by because that's how long the food took. The fact that our food took a very long time coming out while other tables are receiving their meals made me feel unwelcome and undervalued as a customer. \n\nSadly, the ratings of this restaurant is not on par with the quality of food or services of the restaurant. I would not come back to this place and regrettably I would not recommending this place to anyone.", "author": "Kathy N."}

Unless youre going to get the wagu sampler plate ($600) then i would suggest another restaurant.\n\nI called ahead of time to make a reservation for my boyfriends birthday. I tried to switch the time from 6 to 7 because we had a massage before and 6 was just cutting it close. They said there was no way, but when we got there it was an EMPTY restaurant. Ugh. All of that rushing for nothing! And the food wasnt fantastic. We spent a decent amount of money, too.\n\nWe ordered the ahi tuna and a scallop dish foe appetizers. The Ahi just wasnt great. Scallop dish was tasty. We ordered two filets, creamed spinach, and the sweet potato gnocchi. Ive had much more flavorful and buttery filets, and was a little disappointed that this one didnt stand out. \n\nBUT THAT GNOCCI WAS UNREAL. Arguably the best part of the whole meal. I would come back just to order that and a glass of wine. If youre debating sides, defitnely give it a try!", "author": "jessica a."}

So much so that I recommended this place for another friend's wedding/dinner banquet. I went last Friday for my cousin's wedding dinner. They sectioned off a back area for us with about 6-7 tables. It was kind of a 5 course meal type of deal. There was appetizers (truffle fries, delicious peppers, awesome sashimi shots kind of, but on a spoon. Very flavorful), bread, a choice of salad or soup, the main course, and dessert. \n\nStaring with the appetizers: food was on point. Fish was fresh, each spoonful was a flavorful delight. Really good stuff--I dont even like uni and I ate it anyway. The truffle fries were cooked to perfection. Crispy, not hard, not cold. A little on the salty side but dude they are fries, what can you do. Then they had these delicious little peppers with benito flakes. So yummy, can honestly say Ive never had that before in my 26 years of living. \n\nSalad: Amazing. The caesar salad is true to form--sardines or anchovies or something blended in with the dressing. Delicious. I got the iceberg, that was SOOO good. Came with bacon and eggs and bleu cheese. I usually hate bleu cheese but I ate my entire salad. \n\nEntree: This part was where the three stars comes from. I loved my filet mignon---so moist, cooked to medium rare perfection. But my BF got the strip steak, as did 4 others at our table. All 5 people were not too happy with the strip steak. Each one was cooked a little too long and was more medium well-done than medium rare. It sucks that a place which is a STEAK LOUNGE made their strip steak so hard to eat, and kind of dry. But again, the filet mignon was fantastic.\n\nDessert was the chef's choice, some brownie dish. Not anything amazing or mind blowing but certainly moist and rich in flavor.\n\nAnd the service...AMAZING!!! The food arrived neatly plated, then was whisked away and replaced by new silverware and dishes. They even have a fancy table scraper thingamajigger that sweeps the crumbs off the tables. Every waiter  was polite, attentive, and professional. Makes up for the steaks being meh. \n\nThe end!! :)", "author": "Rose C."}

It was her first time at a steakhouse, so I wanted it to be perfect. I've been to many steakhouses before and this was among my least favorite. Let me tell you why:\n\nWe were greeted at the front door by a man who appeared to be the owner. I'm not completely sure if he was the owner, but he sure acted and dressed like it. Everyone was dressed in crisp black attire, but the man who brought us to out table was in jeans, a laid back top, and sneakers. He didn't care too much about smiling or welcoming us to the restaurant. \n\nWe were brought to our own private room with a door that was connected to the kitchen. One would assume that if we needed something extra, our requests would be met first, but nope! It took forever to get our unfilled water cups refilled, some extra sauce for our overcooked steak, and some lemons for our waters. Our waiter was no where to be found and we had to go flagging the busboys down. What they really need is one of those \"I'm ready\" buttons you see at a Korean AYCE. \n\nWe ordered a myriad of different cuts of steak: filet mignon, bone-in ribeye, New York strip steak, prime rib, and the T-bone. The T-bone came with bacon jam and an egg yolk and it was by far the star of the night. Both filet mignons came out overcooked. We asked for medium rare, we got well done. The 32 oz bone-in ribeye was a disappointment. We asked for medium but we got rare. The blood was still dripping red! The flavor was lacking in all the cuts I tried. For this price they charged, I would have easily been happy with steak from a Chinese restaurant.\n\nFor appetizers, we started off with truffle fries, shishito peppers and Korean beef lettuce wraps. The truffle fries tasted like frozen fries you put in the oven to heat up, garnished with a side of what seemed to be aioli mayo. The shishito peppers were light and airy--probably the best shishito peppers I have ever had. My sister's bf loved the Korean beef lettuce wraps. I didn't particularly have a liking for them because it tasted tangy and the meat was too chewy. For sides, we shared the mashed potatoes, asparagus, and cauliflower. If you have to go with a side, go with the cauliflower. The only nice thing about this dish is the vibrant colors. The flavor was lacking in both the mashed potatoes and the asparagus. I felt like they didn't mash their mashed potatoes enough because every bite I ate was like eating a glop of thick cheese. \n\nToo bad, the food and the service did not meet my expectations. At least eating and laughing over the food was a bonding moment for my family. I hope this review serves as a reminder to the restaurant to be in tip-top shape every day of the year because one bad experience means one unhappy customer/unhappy customers and a loss in future visits.", "author": "Amy T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-22", "description": "Anybody want to try steak for $600? Yep it's true. There is a steak tasting plate (12 oz altogether) of Wagyu, Waygu Filet, and Waygu ribcap! Well we weren't in the market for a $600 steak sampler so we stuck with the regular menu. Now note, the steaks are Japanese Miyazaki, and 50% Japanese Waygu-50% Holstein. For my money, I'd rather have an extra night at The For Seasons, than a steak, but that's just me! We enjoyed the slow roasted prime rib, a huge serving of juicy, tender meat and the filet mignon with green garlic sauce, roasted garlic demi glace, and micro parsley. The meat was outstanding. For sides we had the Iceberg lettuce with blue cheese, toybox tomatoes, smoked Applewood bacon, and hard-boiled egg, the creamy spinach, and the mashed potatoes.

I had heard of 5A5 through a friend who loves fine dining, and he recommended the A5 wagyu for our main course. For sides and appetizers, we had ordered truffle fries, shigoku oysters, aussie wagyu sashimi, mashed potatoes, and truffled mac and cheese. All of the appetizers were delicious and did not disappoint. The sides were also lovely and they are very rich so tread lightly. We got the A5 wagyu ribeye and I believe the bone in rib eye as well. The wagyu was so well cooked and it felt as if the meat just melted in your mouth, and you didn't even need to chew to swallow. Overall, we had an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all friends looking for a nice place to take a date or celebrate any occasion.

There's valet out front so that saves time with parking. We had reservations and got there a couple of minutes after our scheduled time, but they were very chill about it and we got seated to our table upon arriving. \n\nNone of us had ever eaten there so our server came out to display the different wagyu cuts and give a brief description of each, which was interesting to learn. We ordered the truffle fries and lobster tempura to start. Before our appetizers came out, they gave us this complimentary miso jelly dish. It came in these little dipping trays and had the consistency of soft tofu but tasted of miso. It was very good. \n\nThe truffle fries were good. I've never been able to figure out what's so great about truffle fries because all the places that I've tried it at didn't make it memorable or enjoyable. \n\nThe lobster tempura is a definite must. I've never been a really big fan of lobster, but this is definitely something you should try. The presentation is pretty but the flavor is what makes it stand out. It's moist and flavorful, not chewy or tough. And they cut for you so you don't have to struggle much to remove the meat from the shell.\n\nBefore our main dishes came out, they gave us these mango things on little spoons to help cleanse our palate. \n\nI ordered the filet mignon and my fiance ordered the dry aged T-Bone. One of my friends ordered the A5 Wagyu Filet so that we all could try what wagyu tasted like. My filet mignon was the perfect portion for me. It was super tender, moist, and juicy. Perfectly medium rare the way I like it. And the dry aged T-Bone was really good too. I got to try some of my friend's wagyu and it's so tender that it melts in your mouth. So worth it. Everyone's dish was extremely good and tasted different from one another so that you could differentiate the different meats.\n\nWe also ordered three sides: the asparagus, truffled mac & cheese, and the shrooms. I like the asparagus and shrooms the best. I didn't care too much for the truffled mac and cheese. And it was a bit heavy too. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the cr\u00e8me brule trio and the fruits and chocolate dish. The cr\u00e8me brule trio came with green tea, ginger, and black sesame. Their cr\u00e8me brule flavors were interesting and different. They weren't too sweet and the flavors shined. I actually liked the ginger one the best. The flavor was more distinct, yet it didn't hold such a strong ginger taste. I'm not a huge fan of green tea so that I thought it was just ok. And the black sesame was ok too.\n\nI liked the presentation of the fruits and berries. It was a combination of raspberries, with chocolate cookies, mousse, cake, and ice cream. \n\n5A5 is definitely one of the nicest steakhouses I've been to. It's only extremely expensive if you order the wagyu cuts, but I think it's worth it to order the wagyu for the experience. Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance and the food very much. The service was excellent. Everyone's extremely nice and kind to you. I would definitely recommend it for the experience.", "author": "Jeannie T."}

I've been to most of the steakhouses in SF, so I wanted to try a new place. (Well, at least for me.) I went to 5A5 about 6-7 years ago for happy hour, so I thought I'd finally try them for dinner. I made a reservation a week ahead for two on Thursday, July 14th at 6pm through OpenTable.\n\n*Hibiki Harmony ($19)\n*Redbreast 12 ($14)\n*Woodford Reserve ($11)\n\nWe started off with whiskey. I got the Hibiki. They have a Japanese whiskey flight, but I wanted to stick to what I know and like. Average price and a normal pour.\n\n*Hamachi: Uni, pickled seaweed, strawberry - kimchi furikake, aji ceviche, ponzu ($5 spoon)\n*Tuna: Avocado, jalapeno, ginger gel, rice pearls, nori chip, dashi-onion cream ($5 spoon)\n*Shigoku Oysters: Sauerkraut, seaweed, kohlrabi, horseradish lime mignonette, crisp kale ($21)\n\nI got the hamachi spoon and we shared the oysters. I remember liking their hamachi shooter back in the day, so I was excited to try this. Nothing like what I remember. Overly dressed and the fish lacked texture. It would have been better if they had a couple pieces of fish instead of chopping it up. They also gave us complimentary salmon spoons, but they were really salty. The oysters were okay. I think the sauerkraut overwhelmed the oyster though.\n\n*Filet Mignon 8oz: Chasseur sauce, roasted ramps, micro wasabi ($49), add Seared Foie Gras (+$23)\n*Dry Aged T-Bone 23oz: Bacon jam, sous vide \"perfect\" egg, demi glace ($52)\n*Asparagus: Pesto, snap pea, quail egg, prosciutto, hickory smoked goat cheese ($13)\n\nI loved the asparagus. Cooked perfectly and the prosciutto added a nice saltiness. And I adored the pesto sauce. My filet was just meh. I love the flavor of meat. There's nothing like a perfectly grilled steak with just salt and pepper. But my filet? Where was the beefy flavor? I know my cut was more delicate, but it just lacked taste. Felt the same way about the foie. It was missing that nice seared foie flavor. I was disappointed as seared foie is one of my favorite foods. I did have a bite of my friend's t-bone. His had much better flavor, but I thought the steak was overwhelmed by the bacon jam. He loved the steak though.\n\nWhat's dinner without wine? I asked our waiter what he would recommend within a certain price range and one of them was the Mad Hatter 2011: Napa Valley, CA ($92). I told him I like full bodied wines and this was was great! Paired very well with our dinner.\n\nI had told them it was my friend's birthday, so they were nice enough to bring out a small dessert. Very beautiful. He loves chocolate, so this was actually perfect!\n\nService was nice and attentive. Everyone at the restaurant was lovely and we had a great time. Maybe 5A5 is better for a wagyu centric dinner, but I found the food very lackluster. I'm all for spending money on dinner, but with tax, tip, etc, our total was a little more than $400. In the end, I just don't think it was worth it.", "author": "Elena N."}

Mind you, this has been the highest graded beef in the world for almost a decade (Ben told us that and then we googled it. Checks out) The whole menu has a Japanese flair to it. Lots of seafood, seaweed, soy-based sauces. The entire meal was fantastic. We had some A5, a couple Australian steaks, and one certified angus steak. All super good.

So happy we did come here! There's parking on the street right in front. We got a spot there. I'm not quite sure if there's a garage anywhere. But when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess. Super nice and very professional. We had to wait a minute for our table so she told us to wait in the lounge. To the left there a bar and a lounge area. Very nice area. The hostess approached us and told us our table was ready. \n\nWe get to our table. Very nice waiter. He took my napkin and said he was going to bring fresh ones. I was wearing black and the napkins were white so he wanted to get me a black napkin so I don't get lint on my dress. He hands us the menu. Then he comes over with a cutting board and shows us the different cuts of meat they offer. And what's on the meat you order. Very helpful and informative. I will add menu pictures. We order wine and the restaurant we originally were planning to go to, sent us complementary champagne for the troubles. \n\nOk food we ordered. I got the Filet Mignon. My boyfriend got the Tajima F1 Filet. Our side choices were sweet potato gnocchi and truffle Mac n cheese. We really wanted to try the mashed potatoes but they were out. Also, they were out of the Prime Rib. Which from other reviews I've seen, it's common. Food was amazing. Everything so good. Toppings on the meat were perfect. Oh man *drool* I can't wait to go back. Oh! Before we got our meals, we got a fruity something on a spoon. From the chef. Soooooo good! I don't even remember what it was called. Or what it was. But it was refreshing and amazing. (See pictures) For desert, we got a tropical fruit something. Can't remember the name exactly. But it was basically Mango juice with lemon grass ice cream and some crunch gronola type stuff in it. Also had Boba on the bottom of the glass. Sooo yummmmm!! (See picture) picture looks so bad but it was so yum! We paid about $220 for everything. We expected more. So we were very pleased\n\nI have this place 4 stars only because of our waiter. Yes he was super friendly and informative. Very helpful. But there was a moment when we were done eating and we were sitting there for maybe 30-45 mins waiting to be checked on. Then he came over and checked on the other two tables next to us. But not us. Then he finally came to us. From other reviews, customer service was a bit of an issue. And the wait was not very pleasant and felt like he just didn't want to serve us. Not saying that was the case. Was just a feeling. We will come back. And I definitely recommend this place.", "author": "Melissa V."}

Service was slow and some awkward moments like when they were clearing the table the guy tried to take a couple dishes with still food on it. SO's like \"um I'm still eating...\" Not like dinner was coming out anytime soon, cuz we waited a really long time for the steaks to come out. Like way too long. \n\nApps:\nlobster bisque: meh. Had so many better. \nSteak tartare: meat was cut well but so much raw onions! That's all I could taste!! Even if I picked them out I could taste them. And 1 quail egg for a long strip of beef? Come on now. So imbalanced. \n\nDinner:\nNot impressed with the Wagyu (I'm Japanese) so I wanted a regular American steak. \nFilet mignon: prob the worst I ever had. I didn't want to send it back and cause a scene in front of my friends. Cut wrong, overcooked (I asked for Med rare, I got Med well), chewy, Dry, barely could swallow it. I didn't even want to eat it. Worst ever.\nDry aged T-bone: cut was fine, cook was fine, but smothered in sauce. SO did not like this. He was disappointed with his steak, and it was his birthday. \nSweet potato gnocchi: it was good, but why such strong ginger flavor? Someone's tastebuds are off in the kitchen. \n\nDrinks:\nGot still water which is Fiji. No error there. \nJapanese whiskey sampler: not impressed.\nJameson. Well no error there either. \nAnd I brought my own bottle of sake. \n\nDessert:\nSome banana bread pudding and mango thing. Wow, horrible.

I came here with a friend a few months ago and this place place delivers a whole experience. Service was great. Wine and cocktail Menu on point. Decor was nice. Food was good . I really enjoyed how the server brings out uncooked steak so you can choose what you want . We went thinking we were getting the filet but with that awesome marketing strategy we decided to try a sampler of 3 different cuts of meat. The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because there is nothing beyond special for me . Nothing that only draws we to this restaurant. All in all it's a great place and expect to pay top dollar for an experience as a whole .", "author": "Jacqueline G."}

Took awhile, but hey, can't complain since we were the late ones initially. It was my birthday, so I decided to be an adult and ordered wine with my steak. On top of that, our waitress was so so nice. She gave us complimentary birthday champagne. Not only for me, but one glass for my bf too! Needless to say, we were really feeling it before our food even arrived. We shared the maple bacon mashed potatoes and bone-in ribeye, and it was way plenty for the both of us. Keep in mind that the steak takes roughly 40 minutes to cook. Our steaks were slightly more rare than we preferred, but they were nice enough to grill it some more for us. For dessert, they gave me a little birthday plate with two small pieces of chocolate cake, and OMG, best chocolate cake of life. Along with the chocolate cake and champagne, our waitress also gave us an appetizer and a free dessert at the end. What?! Although the steak wasn't spectacular, the service was, and I would come back for that.", "author": "Melinda T."}

I was ecstatic since I'm a huge fan of good piece of rare meat. Thankfully we got seated in the booth close to the elevator and had a nice view of the restaurant and kitchen. Decor is very nice and modern, the ceiling lights are beautiful.  Our waiter Scott was absolutely fantastic.  \n\nAppetizers:\n- Truffle fries: This was a disappointment.  Not sure how a nice restaurant like this can mess this up. They look and tasted like day old fries.  It was not appealing to look at nor were they very tasty.  \n- Hamachi: Fresh and delish. \n- Shishito Peppers: These were surprisingly good.  They have a little kick to it so if you can't handle spicy at all, then I would stay away.\n- Steak Tartare: I'm not a fan of steak tartare (even though I like my steak practically raw).  I tried some and it was really good.  \n- Tuna: Fresh and tasty.  One of my favorites.\n\nMain course:\n- Filet Mignon rare with foie gras:  Steak was cooked to perfection.  It was just the way I liked it, and the meat melted in my mouth.  Presentation was beautiful with roasted shiitake mushrooms. The foie gras unfortunately was not great.  Not sure if it wasn't cooked long enough but as soon as I cut a small piece, the entire thing just flattened and parts of it oozed out and tasted off.  \n- Truffled mac n cheese: a must if offered.  It was creamy and delicious. \n- Cauliflower: meh, not a big fan of it in the first place.  But I guess it was good?\n- Shrooms:  They looked cute when it came out, but I'm a picky eater and don't really eat mushrooms. \n\nService:\nOutstanding.

The hostess and waiters were pretty nice, although our waiter was pretty serious, but still friendly (didn't smile much). But he did offer to take pictures for us (even though I asked twice hehe). He would clear our dishes promptly, wipe any spills, and set up our utensils for us for the next course, which I thought was pretty fancy.\n\nNow let's get to the food, The appetizer we ordered was the lobster tempura which came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce which was amazing! The lobster was pretty heavy since it was fried but the sauce did a great job making it lighter. My bf ordered the dry aged tbone which had bacon jam and an egg on top. So delicious!! The flavors were so unique. Every bite just made you want more, so I highly recommend this one. I ordered the prime rib which came with horseradish and Au jus on the side. It was okay..not as flavorful as I had expected, but it was super tender! They cook this ahead of time so they sell it until it runs out! For the side, we ordered the truffle Mac n cheese which had amazing flavor! It was pretty heavy but so delicious. For dessert, we ordered a fruity one, I forgot what it was called, but basically it was a fruit (mango) smoothie with lemongrass froyo, they call \"soup\" with cookie crumbles and tapioca (boba). It was a light and sweet dessert and honestly I thought the tapioca was the perfect touch. Not too crazy about the fruit soup though. \n\nWhen I reserved with OpenTable, I wrote that we were celebrating our anniversary and I appreciate that the restaurant took note of that!

It was a bad year and the last dinner of the year wasn't any better. Since we live in SF sometimes it's fun to do tourist stuff on holidays, this NYE we decided to take the muni down to the Embarcadero and watch fire works after dinner. 5A5 had good reviews and we had never been. They even had reservations available. The bar staff was nice while we waited for our table, they were a bit overwhelmed. Drinks were good. Probably the best part of the experience at 5A5.\n\n\n1. Apps were miserable. Butternut squash ravioli no flavor   and TINY! Like a tasting menu. Beef tartar was chunky and sloppily put together also TINY 4 bites max.\n\n2. Out of the 4 salad/soup options they already ran out of choices. NO beet salad! The pear salad was wilted and dead, tasted like it had sit on a rack in the kitchen for hours and hours. NO flavor nada. The other choices weren't an option since one of us has a shell fish allergy.\n\n3. The dinner options were also TINY and not well prepared. Steak was chewy and cold. The egg was a runny mess, the whites were raw the yoke should be runny but the whites should be a little stable. Absolutely no sides! Again DON'T expect to feel satisfied. The meat was smothered in sauce which took away from whatever flavor it might have had. Seems they cooked it off early then reheated it. Cold meat. Cold.\n\n4. Out of the 2 desert options the waiter told us they sold out of one. \n\nThe restaurant seemed a little ragged carpets a mess and booth side of the table was very low and squishy. \n\nDO NOT COME HERE HUNGRY. \n\nThe bathroom WAS FILTHY! I've seen better in gas stations. \n\n2nd Best part of the night at 5A5 was the older gentleman that sat us.  \n\nLuckily we got out In time for fireworks! \nHere's to a better 2017!!", "author": "Nena L."}

Reservations were easy to make and the service was pretty good.\n\nWe got a bit carried away with all the steak... And we had a very protein filled night. \n\nA5 wagyu sashimi: 4/5: pretty tasty with the sauce. It was smooth and buttery tasting. The only bad part is that it looked like sashimi and using your fork does not help too much. Chopsticks definitely would have helped or I guess using our fingers. \n\nA5 wagyu ribeye: 5/5: there were so many things right with this steak. Hands down the best piece of steak I have ever had. It's extremely buttery, a tad salty and melts in your mouth delicious! It was also cooked to a beautiful medium rare. We ate this a bit slow to savor each bite. With such a huge price tag you don't wanna inhale it too quickly! Now that I've had it, we plan to come back to try the other cuts in the future! Or better yet go to Japan. \n\nBone in ribeye: 4/5: definitely a large slab of beef. It was juicy and tender but compared to the a5 it did not stand a chance. I would choose the a5 over a regular steak any day. It was just that good. This one had a good peppercorn sauce and they cooked it to medium rare. No real complaints but just comparing a regular ribeye to a5 just makes you sad with the huge difference in taste and quality. \n\nTruffled Mac and cheese: 3/5: it was standard for a Mac n cheese dish. It didn't wow me or make me want to order and extra one. They were heavy handed on the truffle oil and it was to the point where I barely tasted any cheese. Maybe a little less truffle oil and more cheese? Overall, it was decent but I'll definitely try other sides next time.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience here and we will definitely be back in the future to try more of their a5 cuts! If you come here, you have to try the A5 steak cuts, it's what this place is known for. You don't know what you are missing out on! The regular steaks are great but it's not a complete experience if you don't eat A5!\n\nTotal for 2 w/tip: $350", "author": "Stella J."}

The seating area is quite big and all the tables provide an intimate atmosphere in an open room - including transparency into the kitchen. As for the noise level - very quiet which makes for a personable experience - no screaming babies or obnoxious tables here!\n\nOur server greeted us and told us about the history of the restaurant and brought out their kitchen sampler to show us a few menu items. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of the Goldeneye Pinot Noir 2012 - and it was literally the smoothest wine besides Caymus that I've tried to date. We were served hot and fresh French bread of two styles - one plain and the other had bacon bits - Yummy!\n\nAs for the appetizers, we ordered the foie gras - and it was so delicious,it melted in our mouths. We also ordered the shishito peppers which were good but HOT and lastly we ordered two spoons of the Hamachi. I didn't enjoy the Hamachi - too fishy for me. \n\nNow for the entrees...\n\nI ordered the Waygu/Holstein hybrid NY cooked medium and it was super tender and juicy. The presentation was so beautiful, I had a hard time eating it. My partner got the filet mignon and it was seriously so tender - probably the most tender filet mignon I've tried. Both steaks were cooked medium but I will say mine wasn't as cooked as I like it but it was still delicious. \n\nWe ordered two sides to pair with our steak; truffle macaroni and cheese and the potato au gratin. The macaroni and cheese overwhelmingly smelled like truffle and it was awesome! The potato au gratin was very interesting, it was soft yet firm cut up potatoes with cheese and different veggies inside served in a small skillet. Both sides were delicious! \n\nFor dessert we ordered the trio of sorbet which includes a scoop of chocolate, cherry and mango. They make their sorbet in house and it shows - super fresh tasting!\n\nThey brought my partner a plate decorated with chocolate that said 'happy birthday' and it had complimentary brownies and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Ray (sp?), the young woman at the front desk, was amazing and had our little girl smiling ear-to-ear.  Well played young lady. The rest of the staff showed her the utmost respect as well.  That's important and not a guarantee at a place with this price point. Bartender gave me a quick history lesson on Japanese whiskey.  Let's eat. \n\nI  ordered the ole' 96er (really a 32oz bone in beast of a ribeye) like a disgusting slob. The rest of the table put in 2 orders of Prime Rib and the T-Bone.  All came perfectly cooked.  I'm glad I ordered the peppercorn sauce on the side.  Something about smothering a fat ribeye in sauce didn't sound right.  \n\nI can't quite put that steak at the top of the list, but it easily competed with some of the marquee names I listed above. It was a damn good steak.  My one gripe was their steak knives could've been sharper.  You don't get 2lb, rare ribeye without having to get a knife through a couple tendons. \n\nThe sides.  It was easily the best truffle Mac I've had. The creamed spinach was right in that conversation also... just a plate of delicious with the perfect amount of slightly toasted Parmesan for texture.  \n\nOur waiter, Ben, was on it. Just super friendly while remaining professional.  He gave us a great rundown on the Wagyu.  That was out of our price range for this family/friends meal but gabe me a semi just looking at that marbling. \n\nIt was pricey, but you knew that going in.  To wrap this novel up, we had a great experience, impeccable service and just a fantastic meal.  Well done guys.", "author": "Steve F."}

I got the 4oz NY steak (I'd guess it was closer to 6+oz) medium rare and it was excellent - for me it was the right amount of steak after enjoying the amazing lobster bisque and sharing truffle fries and Shishito peppers, both of which I would order again. My friends shared the 32oz bone in rib eye, which was also excellent and far more then two grown men could eat. Lobster Mac n Cheese is to die for, don't miss it. Asparagus and mushrooms were ok, but that Mac n cheese!!  Service was slow at times but overall ok. The atmosphere is LOUD when the place is packed, honestly very difficult to hear your own table between the music playing and the other people talking. Good vibes and a younger crowd for the most part. We didn't get the Wagyu - as we have all had it before and the prime steak looked (and tasted) amazing.", "author": "Matthew S."}

Was quick to refill our $8/ bottle sparkling water but did not care to refill our still water when switched. \nFood came out about 40-45 minutes after ordering luckily we had ordered truffle fries. Unfortunately, the fries were cold by the time it had reached our table and the truffle oil was too heavy. The filet mignon was cooked well but tasted bland even with the little sauce it had as garnish. The pomegranate chicken was okay, nothing too special either. The drinks were moderately priced and the truffle mac and cheese was cold within a few minutes making the cheese hard on top and the rest oily within. \n\nRestaurant/ server was not able to separate checks according to the parties, we were two couples: 4 people total but only needed two separate checks, and instead offered to split evenly between two cards. For such a fine dining establishment, one could assume they would have more power over their system.

The pear was slightly hard to pull off the fork, but it was nicely seasoned and chilled before serving.\n\nSteak (Filet Mignon): \n\n9.7/10 - So good!!

I arranged a large business dinner recently during a work conference and my entire party unanimously experienced a lot of attitude from the staff.\n\nWhen we didn't order the $500-$600 Wagyu beef options, there was a noticeable shift in temperament, like our $3K order wasn't good enough for them or something. Sorry for not blowing $10K with you, but are the 6+ bottles of expensive wine not good enough for you? And when is it EVER okay to express disinterest in a party of guests, even if we were ordering just water and appetizers? The service was extremely distasteful here, and many of the people at my table commented upon it. It's a good thing they embedded gratuity on that tab, because that was the most I would have given them and I typically give a MINIMUM of 20% on a tab. \n\nIn addition, the atmosphere here left a lot to be desired. Neon pink, sterile and devoid of any charm or ambiance, I felt like I was eating in the worst of commercial spaces. The tables, seating, music, and decor all worked against you, as a customer, feeling comfortable with your dining experience.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin seemed to occur the next day, when 4 people in our party reported getting drastically ill after dining here. I did not personally have that experience, so I do not believe it was something related to my particular entree (which was salmon), but something my companions ate set off their sensitive stomachs.

Two friends and I visited on Saturday night, and we were excited to try 5A5 given the yelp reviews.  Clearly, the owners have several family members reviewing this place, because no independent reviewer would give this even a passing grade.  \n\nThe meal started with slow service and a 30 minute wait for our reservation.  But, that was forgivable as the bar has a nice atmosphere.  Once we were seated, we started with appetizers of the Shisito peppers (actually very good, the highlight of the meal), and Wagyu sliders.  The sliders were a foreshadowing of what was to come...the meal slid downhill from there!  Despite being ordered medium rare, they were served almost raw.  Besides that, there was nothing \"special\" about these, and tasted like any slider you would get off the \"passed trays\" at any mid-level wedding.  They make a big deal out of their Wagyu here, and we all expected something more.\n\nSalads were next, the baked salad with an egg.  This dish was ok, but certainly nothing exciting.  Then the trouble really began.  The three of us ordered the $80 Ribeye steaks.  I only mention the price because for that, there is an expectation of a good piece of meat.  Again, not only were all three of our dishes WAY undercooked, the meat was tough, filled with gristle, and we were forced to send all of them back.  For those of you like me who say, \"how bad could a steak be?!!  Even a bad steak is pretty good!\", try this and you'll understand.  It was inedible.  Honestly, we spent the night listing places we had better steak than the one served, and it didn't take Morton's or Joe's to beat it.  We're talking Applebee's, Chili's and business class on United were FAR better.  And that isn't a joke, it really was awful.  The sides we ordered, the spinach, mushrooms, and cauliflower were serviceable, but again, nothing special.\n\nThe manager Matthew was the one bright spot.  He apologized profusely, and did what he could to salvage the experience.  But, after being there for hours, we weren't about to wait for another hour for a new steak.  Also, he didn't seem at all surprised by how poor the food was.  I'm guessing his main job is apologizing to customers for the awful food.  So, we left still a bit hungry, and definitely disappointed.\n\nI urge anyone reading that the bar and atmosphere here are nice, and having  drink and maybe an appetizer after work could be an option.  But for anyone who wants a steak dinner, AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!  It is truly terrible.", "author": "Ed D."}

I like the spaciousness of the contemporary interior, and I like that it's a steakhouse with an Asian twist. While I did like the food, I wasn't blown away by the steaks. And when a steakhouse is as talked about as 5A5, I want to be blown away.\n\nI treated my dad here for Father's Day because what kind of dad doesn't love steak? To start, we got the hamachi spoons because that's what everyone says to get. They were yummy, but also comparable to hamachi shooters at good Japanese restaurants. Aka, nothing spectacular. We did get a complimentary pork belly bite and I thought that was really good. For our entrees, I got the filet mignon and my dad got the ribeye. They were cooked perfectly, and I honestly wouldn't expect anything less. I also loved the presentation-- the perfect grill marks on the beautifully charred steaks contrasted nicely with the sauces on the plates. The steaks themselves were delicious, but not buttery melt in your mouth delicious if I had to compare to other steakhouses. That's where I docked off stars because I had really high expectations.\n\nAt least we also got a lot of sides to compensate-- the truffle fries, creamy spinach, mashed potatoes, and shrooms. The truffle fries were addicting to munch on, though I could've done without. Other than that, I was really impressed with the rest. Creamed spinach is always a must for me, so I devoured it. I also liked how the maple bacon on the mashed potatoes resembled more of a thick cut pancetta, and it really took the dish up a couple of notches. I also really liked the variety of sauteed Japanese mushrooms, which was a creative twist the the classic mushroom topper. I forgot the bottle of wine I selected, but red wine really complemented the richness of the meal so don't you dare skimp. To finish, I ordered the smores dessert. I loved the deconstructed presentation, and every bite tasted just as good as it looked. It was seriously REALLY good.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience here but I wasn't too impressed by the actual steaks. Next time I'll probably order from the Japanese Wagyu section and hopefully enjoy my meal more.", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

The inside seems like a hip lounge, but luckily it wasn't too crowded on a weekday night.

For drinks, we ordered some bottles of red wine, but I had also ordered the A5 Sazerac and thought it was perfectly smooth (probably one of my favorite cocktails this year).\n\nFor my entree, I went with the 8 oz filet mignon and it was definitely juicy. I kind of wish I went with one of the hybrid steaks (wagyu + holstein) to see how that would even taste, but thought the filet would be a safer choice. We decided to get a few orders of panna cotta for dessert and while I thought it was delicious, it could have been the couple of glasses of wine that masked my taste buds.

We got to the restaurant around 7:30 (quite a bit early but unsure about traffic coming from the East Bay). The bar/lounge was completely empty and totally underwhelming. We decided to belly up to the bar for a cocktail while waiting for our table. The bar area looked like it belonged to a sports bar, not a nice expensive steakhouse. Luckily the hostess grabbed us around 8 and seated us at our table. The table was so big that it really hindered our ability to have a conversation. I always felt like I had to yell for my dad to hear me across the table. However, our waiter was fantastic and so much fun! \n\nOn to the wine/food...\n- We received complimentary appetizers and prosecco...nice touch.\n- We ordered the edamame...a lot of sauce but tasty.\n- I ordered the hamachi and tuna spoons...only got one and had to remind the waiter for the other. A lot of sauce but tasty. I like to taste my raw fish.\n- My dad and husband ordered the dry aged t-bone...both loved it - said it was the deal of the night!\n- I made my own and ordered the Tajima F1 Filet and swapped out the toppings for JUST truffle butter. So glad I did because I think anything else would have been too much and drowned out the flavor.\n- We ordered the asparagus and sweet potato gnocchi for sides...nothing to write home about.\n- Dad got a complimentary birthday dessert which he devoured.\n- Husband and I got a chocolatey dessert. Good but nothing too special.\n- I had a glass of the Failla Pinot Noir and was really disappointed. My husband was disappointed with his wine as well.\n\nAtmosphere...\nThey really need to step up their game in the bar/lounge area. It takes up so much space and was basically empty the entire time we were there on a Saturday night.

However I wasn't completely disappointed. When my party of 7 arrived we were seated in the lounge area for about 20 minutes while the hostess apparently searched for us a section. After the nearly half an hour wait on a not so busy Monday evening, we were seated in a great spot against the wall. The ambiance is very nice and relaxing. The music was good and fit the vibe of the restaurant. The lighting was good, very even throughout the room. The drinks were excellent! I ordered a Thyme for a smile, and a greyhound (Vodka & grapefruit juice). Very strong and delicious. Then there was the service, which to my opinion was very very good. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and intuitive to our tastes. Management also came by and gave us some complementary samples to try of which the ribeye and polenta was my personal favorite. However when it came to the food I was disappointed. I ordered the New York strip which was honestly very tender and reasonably flavorful, no complaints there. But as far as the rest, not so much. I ordered the garlic and fennel soup which was very beautifully presented but tasted like a nursing home pur\u00e9e. For side dishes to compliment my New York strip I ordered the maple bacon Mac and cheese and the bacon and cheese mashed potatoes. Both dishes tasted like I was eating a bowl of maple syrup. The bacon itself tasted like a well roasted Christmas ham, but on top of another dish it was quite overwhelming. And then the mashed potatoes mixed with cheese was good minus the bacon, however the cheese changed the consistency as the dish cooled and it became like a thick skin across the top which was less than pleasant. Overall based on my experience I give this place 2 stars, one for the ambiance and service, and one for the drinks!", "author": "Anthony M."}

My friends and I went to 5A5 Steak Lounge during the holiday season a few days before Christmas. Nice and comfortable atmosphere. Food was overrated. I ordered the dry t-bone steak and the wagyu sliders. The sliders were not that much special. Don't expect it's real wagyu beef in the sliders. It's just beef.... Nothing too special. Fries were good. I guess I was pretty full after having the sliders and the complimentary appetizers from the chef, so the steak was not as good as I expected. At that time, I felt my mom makes better steak than them. The steak was huge. I think the steak is good for 2 people if you order the sliders. I couldn't finish all my food. Anyways, the steak tasted so good the next day or the day after when I heated up. It could be either I was hungry at the moment or I was really full at 5A5 Steak Lounge. Overall, I think I paid more than $80 for this. But this is because we got the giftcard from costco. Without the giftcard, it would cost over $100. So go get the giftcard and get some discounts. One last note, the bathroom stalls are extremely dark. The mirror is behind the door. There is no point to look at yourself in the mirror inside the bathroom stall because it is sooo dark. If you want to check on the mirror, be sure to bring a flashlight or your phone with you so you can see yourself in the mirror....", "author": "Kat K."}

The website pictures perfectly depict the actual restaurant\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided to share a steak and a couple of sides. We ordered the bone in rib-eye, truffle mac and cheese and the shrooms. Everything was delicious! First off, the steak is 30 ounces! That's plenty of meat for two people to share (see photo). We both were stuffed and even had a good portion left to take home...its that big. From the detailed description of the steak (grilled corn pico de gallo, tomatillo sauce and chipotle demi), I wasn't sure what taste to expect. Our choice of meat is always rib eye, so we just stuck with our default steak. Glad we did cause it was so tasty! The steak was so juicy and the flavor separated itself from traditional rib eyes that I've tried. At $55 for a 30 ounce delicious bone in rib eye at a nice fine dining establishment, that is a steal! \n\nNot sure if Costco still sells 5A5 gift cards, but we got a $100 gift card at Foster City Costco for $80.", "author": "Gail A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "description": "One word to describe our experience here: Heartache. \n\nWe really, really wanted to like this place, especially since its Yelp page is chock-full of glowing reviews. Not to mention, their menu was developed by the Executive Chef of Alexander's Steakhouse. I mean, with that sort of impressive backing, it's GOTTA be good, right? \n\nDISHES\nDuring our visit, we shared their: 25 oz bone-in rib eye (opted for its sauces on the side), pan seared sea bass, four shooters (hamachi and maguro), and mashed potatoes w/ white cheddar and maple bacon. The sole highlight of our evening had been the bottle of Recuerdo Malbec that we ordered. I believe that reveals a lot. \n\n+ The medium-rare bone-in rib eye was disagreeably chewy and it lacked the beefy and fatty robust flavor that it ought to have. Tenderness was absent and our steak was lacking in moisture. We generally opt for the rib-eye cut for the most flavor and juiciness, so you can imagine how bummed we were. \n\n+ Pan seared sea bass. Similar disappointment as the aforementioned dish. Though it didn't have a fishy taste and even though it was cooked with the crispy skin on, it wasn't astonishing. As tolerable as this dull fish dish was, it wouldn't prompt us to revisit. \n\n+ In regards to the shooters, we were expecting to taste the flavors of Hamachi and Maguro. Instead, the fish were completely overshadowed by the strong acidity and tanginess of the ponzu. The tasteless mashed potatoes we ordered as a side were noticeably slushy. Way too liquidy to be appetizing. My fianc\u00e9 actually even expressed that its texture and taste were similar to packaged instant mashed potatoes. If it weren't for the pieces of maple bacon, this side would be deemed as bland. \n\nSERVICE \nBesides the indistinctive dishes, what also irked us about our experience was our server. He presented himself as insincere, lazy, and seemed to be hurrying us out of the restaurant. He checked-in on us in the beginning to pour wine into our glasses, and the second time, he poured the remainder of our wine all the way to the top, close to the brim, so that he wouldn't have to come back to us. Call us critical, but we thought this was unprofessional. \n\nVENUE\nWith its posh furnishings, trendy bar area right next to the open dining area, and the vibrant lighting, this steak lounge is sexy AF. The only reason I would want to come back here is to just loiter around the stylish lounge area and impersonate some VIP. I fully appreciate the lively ambiance and the attractive d\u00e9cor. \n\nWith its seemingly outstanding reputation as a steakhouse, I don't think I had unrealistic expectations regarding the quality of their steaks.

Unfortunately I didn't realize until after I made the non-refundable-deposit reservation that I couldn't order from their regular menu on NYE. \n\nThe pre-fixe menu was $145/person. My friend also ordered the wine pairing with it for an additional $95/person.\n\nAppetizer: I order the Crustaceans which was a trio of a crab cake, fried 1/2 lobster tail, and grilled shrimp. The fried lobster tail was FANTASTIC. I'd eat that every week if I could. It was so perfectly fried in a light and crispy tempura batter. The crab cake was good. I've had just as good at other places so it didn't wow me, but I don't have any complaints. The shrimps were SO OVERCOOKED it was not even enjoyable. I was so surprised that such a restaurant would even let shrimps cooked like that leave the kitchen. The flavor was fine but the awful texture of the shrimp really took away from the dish.\n\nSoup: I ordered the quail soup which came with shiitake mushrooms, bok choy, and (I think?) vermicelli. By itself the soup was alright for me. A little too much of a strong taste and I'm not a huge fan of quail. What did make this soup fantastic though was the wine that was paired with it. I'm not much of an alcohol person so I had my doubts with how much a good wine could elevate a dish but this definitely made me believe! The wine with the broth was a perfect pair and definitely brought this soup from a 2 for me to a 4.\n\nMain Course: I ordered the filet mignon medium rare. It came atop another cut of beef that I don't remember but it had the taste of stew meat, which isn't a bad thing. This was pretty good, but honestly for $145 I was expecting to be blown away. Quite frankly, we were expecting more.  We probably could have had just as an enjoyable steak somewhere else for $65, had we started making reservations sooner. \n\nDessert: We ordered one of each of the desserts offered on the pre-fixe menu. My friend had the coffee themed one which had coffee ice cream and a coffee panna cotta. His dessert was really delicious. I loved everything that it came with and the homemade ice cream was very memorable. I don't remember much of my dessert. It was something like a fruit filling with a crumble on top and a sorbet. It was okay but I didn't like it nearly as much as his. \n\nService: Service was fine. I only had to ask for my water to be refilled once. We probably could have had better service if we dressed a little less casual, perhaps?\n\nOverall, our experience was more positive than negative. To me, it wasn't worth the price of $145. I might have enjoyed it more if I had the opportunity to order from their regular menu. I don't see myself coming back as there are so many options in San Francisco, but it is a place I would mention to friends if they were looking for steakhouses in the city.", "author": "Claire P."}

The retro-chic decor and swanky lounge are great for happy hour but the food is hit or miss. I'd recommend sticking to a few drinks and appetizers after work, but Uber over to Alexanders's, Lolita, or even Harris' for good steak dinner.\n\nMost other reviews are about experience, very personal and based on the expectations of the diner(s), the night of the week, the weather, or a number of other variables. My husband and I had a good experience. The staff were nice and maybe a little overly attentive.\n\nThe food, though, was all over the place:\n\nThe Good\n- The amuse bouche and palate cleanser were excellent, with well constructed flavor combinations.\n- The U-10 scallop appetizer was delicious. Perfectly seasoned and cooked scallops served with surprisingly good squid-ink spaghetti. The flavors worked together without overpowering the scallop.\n- The creamy spinach side tasted a bit like the green bean casserole recipe on the French's Onions box, but done well.\n- The filet mignon was the star, properly fired medium-rare. The green garlic sauce was chimichurri-esque and just the right amount.\n\nThe Boring\n- The New York Strip.\n\nThe Bad\n- The tuna tartare (plate) was a mess - overly spiced dry-rubbed, seared outside, and refrigerator-cold inside. SF knows good sashimi, where the tuna speaks for itself. There's no place for cumin on tuna unless you're trying to hide something.\n- The crab salad was poorly executed. Chicken-salad style crab was a good idea. But it was soaked in overly oniony mayo and served right out of the fridge. Plating was in little domes as if with an ice cream scoop, then topped with flavorless latices of lotus root. (Maybe the onion was so overwhelming that we couldn't taste the lotus root.) To add insult to a lousy dish, the cracked pepper served to order couldn't penetrate the little latices to give the cold mayo some hope of recovery; that's just bad engineering. \n\nThe Really Bad\n- Dessert. There were no good choices. The pastry chef seemed to think separating desserts into their ingredients before serving them would make them fancy - bad engineering again. \nWe got the banana bread with glaze, served with mango smoothie and plantain. None of the items were tolerable, making this the first time we've left dessert uneaten. (The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill, which we didn't expect, but appreciated.)\n\nIt's possible we just picked the worst items, but I think if a restaurant has 3 dollar signs ($$$) there should be no \"worsts\" on the menu. We will not go back, but if you are meeting friends, stick with the steak and scallops, and try the mac and cheese for us. Then wander next door to Kokkari for dessert.", "author": "T G D."}

It was our first time here, excited about the menu, had our meal planned out. We were greeted nicely by the hostess and sat in their lounge for a couple of minutes, admiring the interior, dim, oozing sexiness, charmed with ambient lighting. Someone came over and asked if we wanted drinks, which we didn't but we appreciated his attentiveness. We were seated promptly. So far so good. Our server comes over and here's the verbatim dialogue: Him: \"Have you been here before?\" Me: \"No it's our first time and super excited; it's such an unobtrusive entrance, we've passed it many times, and never knew it existed ... in fact, I was telling my husband I feel like I'm cheating on my wife, cuz we go to Kokkari hundreds of times.\" We laugh about this, and leaves us to look at the menus, which my husband and I read with our iphone light. We're loving the ambience: a dark, sexy place, oozing seduction. He returns and with a flourish, places a rectangular plate in front of us with 3 pieces of what looked to me in the dim light, like bread and what my husband assumed were appetizers. Our server starts explaining the menu and motions to the plate he'd set down, whips out a mini light and shines it on the plate. It was raw slabs of wagyu beef. I must admit: I recoiled, not appetizing to look at raw cow sitting in front of my face (the reason I never order steak tartare). As he's about to extol the virtues of the prized wagyu, about to trot out the rehearsed spiel about it, I decide I'll save him time, I say, \"Let me save you the bother of going into this, because we're not going to order from this section, we're going to order from the upper half.\" He looked surprised, so I say \"When I've had wagyu, I've hated it.\" Him: \"I'm curious, what don't you like about it?\" Me: \"The texture and marbling ... and it's off-putting to stare at this raw beef in front of me.\" Him: in a stiff and tightly controlled, rigid tone of voice gets defensive, says \"We're REQUIRED to present wagyu ... but let me get it out of your way,\" after which he yanks it off the table and stalks, face beet red, frozen in half fury and smirk. My husband and I look at each other in shock, both of us wondering if we're being overly sensitive, but unable to shrug off that we both feel insulted. My husband who is more easy going than I, would've left the situation alone, but I couldn't let it go. We sat there for over 5 minutes, me saying I felt hurt that the waiter was covertly pissed off. I knew I wouldn't be able to relax after this. We decide to leave, and as we're passing the lounge, he intercepts us and says, \"It didn't work out for you?\" My husband: \"We decided to go elsewhere.\" As we passed him, our backs to him, he calls out \"Good luck to you.\" This is one of those times where you had to be there, in the context, had to hear the tone of voice, the barely disguised hostility, this was not an example of sincere well-wishing. This is textbook passive aggressive. Not about to let him get away with this, I turn back toward him (as my husband is pulling my hand cuz he doesn't want a confrontation). But I insist and turn around to the waiter, saying \"I want to let you know the reason we're leaving is because of your defensive posture.\" He says, \"You thought I was defensive?\" Me: \"Yes, your attitude about the raw beef ... \" He says voice clipped and terse, face turning red again, \"That was not my intent, I wanted to guide you toward something else.\" Really? Why?? After I already told you we'd be ordering off the top section of meat and fish? I didn't say this last sentence but should've. Instead, I say, \"This was an unfortunate situation.\" He says nothing. Amidst curious stares from other servers, hostess, and staff, we walk out of the restaurant. I wish I'd gotten his name, because this poor man has a major chip on his shoulder and should not be in the service industry. I'd suggest he get more hospitality training, but I doubt it'll help. There are those who are born with gracious bones and are sublime in service. This waiter is not one of those people; he has no clue what genteel looks like. I hope management understands that a restaurant is many moving parts, a huge part service and no matter how fantastic the food, if treated shabbily, a customer will never return--just as we never will. And with just one negative experience, a customer will bad mouth them--just as I'm now doing.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

I understand its NYE, and it was packed but the meal took about 3+ hours... for 4 courses. We felt neglected as it took about 45 minutes for each course to come out and drinks took about 20-30 minutes. Also they got 3 out of the 4 courses wrong for my table - each time there was a wrong appetizer, wrong soup, and wrong dessert...\n\nAppetizers - Beef tartare, good but nothing extraordinary\n\nSalads/Soups - They ran out of the beet salad by 8 PM! Which means they had about 4 more hours of service and no beets... had to opt for the pear salad which was bleh, the pear had no flavor, the arugula did not look at its prime\n\nSteak - The filet was only the filet and no choice of adding any veggies a la carte style... it was cooked correctly, medium rare, but it was quite rubbery/chewy so makes me question the quality of the meat. Also for the NY strip, the chef had to switch out the bone marrow for this jam/egg thing  because he didn't like the quality of it .... \n\nDessert - Dry bread pudding with an over powering aroma of star anise \n\nAnd worst of all...bathroom was beyond filthy for a high-end steak place, so many stalls were trashed with no toilet paper. \n\nI'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because the waiters were nice and the environment was enjoyable but the kitchen were the ones who put out subpar food and bad management who only staffed 2 bartenders for a packed night and no facility worker! \n\nDefinitely not coming back", "author": "Diana N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-21", "description": "My lovely boyfriend turned 30 today! His two requests: comic book shopping and a steak. After Yelpin' the hell out of the Bay Area in search of a fabulous steakhouse, I came across 5A5 and made reservations quickly on their website. Best decision I've ever made!\n\nFirst things first-- parking is sort of difficult. We left early in order to find parking nearby while trying to avoid the $10 valet fee. We lucked out and found a metered spot down the way- after driving for 15+ minutes- and it was a short walk to the restaurant. \n\nThe maitre'd was kind and absolutely hilarious. Our server, Scott, was fantastic. He was attentive but not over the top-- he was there when we needed him and checked in on us just enough. \n\nWe started with the seared foie gras. Seared perfectly, on top of a thick slide of brioche, paired with candied cherries to complement the richness of the foie. It was easily one of the best preparations of foie that I've ever had. \n\nFor dinner, my bf had the 15 oz prime rib topped with seared foie gras. I had the massive bone in ribeye (32 freakin' ounces!) topped with- you guessed it- more foie gras! Both cuts of meat were cooked to a perfect medium rare. The rub on the prime rib was delicious, and the sauce on the ribeye was a perfect complement to the steak. We also ordered the truffled Mac and cheese (must try!) and the asparagus (huge portion, cooked perfectly). I could go on for hours on how great everything was but nothing I could say would do the food justice. It was THAT good.\n\nTo end our dinner, we ordered the strawberry shortcake dessert, and Scott surprised my bf with a piece of chocolate cake for his birthday. Presentations on both desserts were beautiful. The chocolate cake was rich and moist, topped with whipped cream and a fruit compote. The strawberry shortcake was delicious! Recommended to us by Scott, it was almost deconstructed, and every aspect of the dish came together to create a fabulous dessert. I also had a cappuccino, which was also delicious.\n\nIt's not often that normal folks like my boyfriend & I dine at restaurants like 5A5. It's pricey, yes. But absolutely worth it. The quality of food, service, and ambiance creates a perfect atmosphere for a perfect dinner to splurge or celebrate a special occasion. Scott was phenomenal and we can't thank him enough for providing us with excellent service to go along with an excellent meal. \n\nOne quirky thing- the \"universal\" bathrooms confused the hell outta me for a minute (don't laugh at me, lololol). I walked downstairs and thought I had entered the men's room, and searched for a few minutes for the women's restroom. But they're unisex! Also, super clean and very modern. (You know a restaurant is dope when their bathrooms are also impressive.)\n\nThank you, 5A5 and Scott, for a perfect evening!", "author": "Danielle D."}

The portion sizes can be very filling though, so do come with someone who can share with you (so you can try more things!)\n\nI tried the hamachi shooter, 22 oz dry aged t-bone (about $50), 4 oz dry aged NY strip steak (about $25), truffled mac&cheese with lobster ($26), and the chocolate fondant for dessert.\n\nThe t-bone was perfect medium rare as requested and had amazing flavor. The NY strip steak was leaner and tougher than the t-bone, so I personally didn't like it as much. The truffled mac & cheese had three types of cheese (gruyere, mozzarella and cheddar) and we added the lobster for an extra $14 - worth it! It's a very rich side dish though, you'll definitely want to share.\n\nSave room for dessert if possible!

I'm not sure, but it's progressive and I'm really digging it.\n\nOn to the food:\nI suspect it was the onions that made my aged NY Sttrip so sweet. While that was unusual, it wasn't entirely unwelcome. My boyfriend ordered an A1 Filet, and the difference in taste was remarkable. But the difference between the consistency of the two was game-changing. I knew that when I came here next, I would be the one with the wagyu dish.\n\nI also had a delicious Spiced Pear drink more that was tasty in all of its cinnamon-y goodness.\nAs expected, the truffle fries were amazing and withe the additional benefit of the siracha aoli, an unexpected plus\n\nWe ordered the S'mores dessert, which was not what we were expecting visually, but it did a nice vanishing act once we figured out what was going on.\n\nOn our second visit (my birthday), the palate cleansers were delightful and the service ninja-like and warm. I paid more attention to the patrons, which featured more children than I would have expected from a $$$-ranked establishment.\n\nI ordered a St. Germaine and soda while our Soup du Jour was on it's way. The creamy Tomato Bisque was delicious and we both lost our manners to the spoon when it stopped being able to scoop the bottom of the bowl. Slurrrrp!\n\nI ordered a very rich A5 Wagyu New York cut, served normally with truffle and cheese crown. I only had the four ounce, but I'm glad I did, as the pure richness hit me about 3/4 through, and I had to trade off for my boyfriend's Half and Half Tajima F1 Filet demi glace with mushroom. Maybe I'm losing my sense of taste with my well-established coffee habit, but I could have sworn that his Filet had some Cabernet in that sauce too...\n\nFor a side, we ordered the Potatoes Au Gratin, which is proportioned to feed four, but we did our best. It too was very rich, with several types of potatoes and thick cheesy \n\nAll's well that ends well. Dessert!

The truffle fries were sooo addicting! It went perfectly with the Siracha aioli sauce. The steak tartar was good, but I wouldn't order it again. My filet was a little over cooked, however, it was still delicious, so I didn't bother sending it back. My husbands T-bone steak was absolutely phenomenal! It was topped with some type of sauce and egg which made it that much better.\n\nUnfortunately, we were too full to order any dessert, however, our server brought us two complimentary desserts anyways, which was thoughtful. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I chose 5A5 Steak House to celebrate my husbands birthday. The t-bone was the best steak I've ever tasted so far! I will definitely be back :)", "author": "Esther C."}

The appetizers were two bite-sized spoons filled with a poke sort of thing. I enjoyed it a lot and I wished I could've had more! \n\nNext came the Caesar salad. I really liked the added lemon taste to the dressing. There were also so salted anchovies which complemented the salad nicely. \n\nIt took about an hour between the salad for my NY strip steak. That upset some of the people I came with. I ordered my steak medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The side of potatoes and string beans were also good. \n\nFor dessert, we had a hazelnut bar. I liked it a lot. The raspberry sorbet it came with was a little on the sweeter side. \n\nOverall, it was a positive experience except for the long wait between courses.

My experience there was nothing less than satisfying since everything--from the service to the ambience and food--was above and beyond my expectations. \n\nPrior to the main course, my gal pal and I ordered a bunch of appetizers to share. I can't remember them all now, but I believe there were mussels, truffle fries, truffle mac and cheese, and duck confit croquettes. Everything tasted awesome blossom, and I still had room for more food at the end.\n\nFor the main course, I decided to try the dry-aged steak since our waiter gave it an excellent recommendation. When I got the steak, however, I was a bit surprised by the fact that it was covered with some hollandaise-like sauce and a poached egg on top. After taking a bite into the mix of meat +sauce + egg, I decided that the taste was too strong for me. I like my cows naked in my mouth. When there's too much sauce and anything else to adulterate its el natural flavor, my tastebuds get too confused to fully enjoy it. To my surprise, our waiter graciously took the dish back upon learning about my dislike of the dish. I ordered a prime rib as a replacement, and within about 5-10 minutes, it was ready. In the meanwhile, we were given with a side dish on the house as well. I can't remember what the dish was now, but I do recall that it was good. The prime rib was oh so tender and I loved every bite of it. If anything needs to be fixed, it was that there wasn't enough jus. As I'm typing this review, I'm getting more and more tempted to make another reservation and try their other dishes soon. Real soon. And you know what? You should, too, because 5A5 is nothing less than awesome.", "author": "Joy H."}

Clearly service deserves an overall 5.  Our waiter was wonderful as well.  We checked in on Saturday night before restaurant was opened but they served us cocktails at the bar anyways.  the ambience was contemporary chic.  The lighting was beautiful.\n\nThe food is a solid 4 overall.  There were 6 of us and we shared 2 bone in rib eye steaks, 2 T-bone steaks, sides of foie gras, schrooms, lobster Mac & cheese, truffle fries and shishito peppers.  Can I say the best dish, bar none, was the Mac!  It was soooo good, it melts in your mouth!  This is a must side!  The truffle fries were slightly short of truffle oil but still very good.  The steaks were nice but nothing extra ordinary.  The other sides were all relatively good.  \n\nParking in the financial district is always a challenge so of course we ubered it.  The bathroom is gorgeous.  Nice calming color and a unisex long chic sink.  The bathroom entrance had beautiful flowers and was very welcoming.\n\nAs far as a steakhouse, this is a great restaurant.  Why the bill came it was about $700 plus.  We brought our own wine so this cost only included cocktails and one bottle of wine.  Average of $120 per head, a little steep but not too bad.\n\nOverall experience is 4.5.  Most of the .5 is for Sir George.

I made a reservation through open table and a couple days before we even went to 5A5 they were so kind to call me and not only confirm the reservation but inquire because I wrote a note about it being a birthday.\n\nOnce we arrived we had great service from start to finish for our meal. We got the wagyu sliders, truffle fries, filet mignon, prime rib and a trio of sorbet. They bring you sourdough and bacon bread with butter to begin with and let me tell you bacon bread is a thing and it needs to be more well known.\n\nTo start with ALWAYS get the truffle fries! If you are like me and you love fries especially when they are thin and have a great crispy crunch to it you will love it here. The wagyu sliders were heavenly and made me almost switch to the wagyu beef for my entree with how juicy it was and it was a huge slider that I did not expect. The sweet potato fries on the side of the sliders was delicious but I didn't care too much for the wasabi oil tossed on top of the fries.\n\nThe filet mignon came out and I was amazed by how beautiful it looked and I didn't want to eat it. It was delicious but I did ask for a medium-rare and it did come out a little more rare than I wanted. However, I was okay with it. The prime rib came out and it was a big ole slab of meat that definitely made my boyfriend happy. It came with the sauce on the side and he enjoyed it a lot.\n\nFor dessert we decided on a trio of sorbet which had cherry, passionfruit and pineapple. I love sorbet and it was amazing how fresh it tasted and if you like sour that definitely tastes sour! They also gave us a complimentary dessert for his birthday which they wrote beautifully and it was a pumpkin cake with fresh whip cream. \n\nThe ambience is great here and you feel very comfortable. The service is great they make sure you have water consistently and keep you happy with your food.

When I made partner at the firm, I rented out the room in the downstairs area of this not so fine establishment to throw a party with friends and family. To my dismay, my colleague's and I received the worst service I have ever received at any San Francisco establishment. The atrocities ranged from simple issues like not providing refills on drinks, waiting over 45 minutes to take our order, and taking another hour to serve our group. This made less sense considering we rented out an entire room to ourselves so our server should have had one group to tend to. Fortunately the food was amazing, but not good enough to take away the pure lack of respect we received from the wait staff. When I voiced the issue to manager Matthew Rhinehart, he told me to let him know ahead of time when I would come back so he could make it up to me. When I reached out to Rhinehart, he blatantly ignored me and made the decision not to respond to me which speaks volumes to how valuable his word is as a man.

It's more of a lounge setting than your typical steakhouse with dim lighting and a very nice atmosphere.\n\nTo make a reservation, you must give them a credit card. They do charge a fee for last minute cancellations and no shows. So make sure you cancel within 24 hours. They also call you to confirm your reservation as well which is nice if you forgot about it and do need to cancel.\n\nThey have a prix fixe menu but we decided to select our own appetizers and entrees.\nTo start, we ordered a bottle of wine based on our server's recommendation. On Sunday bottles of wine were 50% off. Pretty cool. They also start by telling you about the Wagyu beef.\n\nFor Appetizers we ordered:\n1. Hamachi shooters- I was doing my research before our reservation and this was highly recommended. I definitely agree! I would give this 5 stars. Very flavorful and the fish was fresh too. It came with a nice presentation on a spoon which made it easy to eat too. FYI, they have happy hour where these shooters are 2 for $5 instead of 1 for $5. Total deal in my opinion.\n\n2. Truffle Fries- 3.5 stars, I thought it was your average truffle fries. It didn't stand out from other truffle fries for me. Gave it an extra half star because the sriracha aoili was different. pretty tasty. I mean I love fries so I'll always want to order truffle fries anywhere I go.\n\n3. Tuna Tataki- 3.5 stars. It came with watermelon slices and seared tuna. It's a very unique dish and surprisingly the watermelon and tuna complimented each other, but it wasn't as flavorful as I expected from the nice presentation. The tuna needed a bit more seasoning.\n\n4. Wagyu Beef Sashimi- 5 stars. I thought the beef sashimi was really good and tasty. The beef was very tender. The topping complimented the beef and was packed full of flavors. A different take on your beef tataki.\n\nFor Entrees:\n\n1. Slow Roasted Prime Rib- 3 stars, average prime rib, cooked rare like I asked. plating was plain too. You can get better prime rib elsewhere.\n\n2. Filet Mignon- My mom enjoyed it very much. It was pretty good 4 stars.\n\n3. Dry-Aged bone in NY- 5 stars, my favorite steak of the night. It came with an egg on top that was cooked perfectly too and the bacon jam was very tasty. The steak was cooked to my liking, rare. Very juicy, lots of flavor, and everything complimented each other well.\n\n4. Bone in Ribeye- 4 stars. It was a big serving. It was tasty\n\nFor Sides:\n\n1. Mac and Cheese- Can't go wrong here 4 stars.\n\n2. Brussels Sprouts- pretty good and tasty, I love brussels sprouts so 4 stars.\n\n3. Mushrooms- meh. Won't be getting this next time, it was just sauteed mushrooms. 3 stars.\n\nOverall, dinner was very good and we were all stuffed afterwards. All our steaks were cooked to our liking. Service was impeccable. Price is as expected around a $50 steak, of course if varies with cut and size.\n\nI definitely want to return to try their A5 experience and of course for happy hour!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

We started with truffled fries with Sriracha aioli dipping sauce and it wasn't balanced right and with way to much season in the French fries. \n\nWas going to ignore that and just deal with it since I was hungry but then he brought out my steak and said the sauce with the poached egg \"Bacon jam, sous vide \"perfect\" egg, demi glace\" would even out the sweetness of the sauce. It just made the steak taste like egg. Not a fine \"aged\" cut nor was it cooked medium like I order.\n\nThe sides of truffled Mac and cheese was ok nothing crazy and the mashed potatoes was whipped to the point that it didn't deserve the name mashed potatoes, just call it whipped potatoes. \n\nNo one asked how it was nor did I put myself out there. How serious would you take someone if they showed up in jeans and T-shirt and said the food tasted bad, really bad. I paid the bill than rather bicker about my food being of low quality. I would have paid $30 for what they served me. \n\nExtremely disappointed.", "author": "Christopher C."}

I'm not that big on steaks but agreed since he's been wanting to try wagyu for awhile now. \n\nWe managed to get a reservation on OpenTable but at 6pm, it wasn't too crowded for dinner yet. I didn't care too much for the bacon bread or the sourdough but it was something different. We ended up ordering 100% wagyu 4 oz ribeye ($38/ounce), mac and cheese, wagyu sliders with garlic sweet potato fries ($17?), and a steak bone in rib eye ($48). Everything was ordered medium rare except the wagyu we ordered it bleu (extra rare). I have never ordered any meat rare but with such a high premium grade, I was pleased to find it melting in my mouth. The bone in steak was way too much for me to finish by myself and even with help, I still ended up taking almost half of it home! The garlic sweet potato fries that came with the sliders could have been less soggy and more garlic-y but that didn't matter too much since the sliders were AMAZING. Great appetizer to start our meal with.\n\nService is superior. Waiters are easy to find and even when you get up to go tot he restroom and leave your napkin on your chair, they take time in folding your napkin and placing it on the table next to your plate. In between courses, they clean off your table of all crumbs. I wasn't dressed as fancy as some people were and never felt like we were treated any differently than other customers like some high end restaurants would do). Bf was wearing a vneck, northface fleece, and jeans and I wasn't dressed much better.\n\nHe also had purchased beforehand 5A5 giftcards at Costco ($80 for $100 worth). He probably should have bought 3 giftcards but had only purchased 2.\n\nFun fact: The reason why it's called 5A5 is the first 5 stands for the 5 senses and A5 is the grade of meat. You use all 5 senses in your dining experience!", "author": "Lauren K."}

The server was attentive and informative. The dishes are well decorated and delicious. \nFor appetizers, since my friend can't eat seafood, I had hamachi ceviche on the spoon. It is thoughtful of the chef to come up with the spoon size option for the appetizer since I wanted to taste the hamachi without devouring the entire portion by myself. In one spoon, there were multiple seasoning that all complement each other well!\nThe highlight of the night was the filet of 50% A5 wagyu and 50% Holstein. The filet was tender, juicy and well-marbled! My friend ordered the prime rib, although it was delicious as well, but you will taste a noticeably different between the filet and the prime rib. \nFor dessert, my friend had the citrus panna cotta. The plate was beautifully decorated with edible flower petals, but the panna cotta is a bit too creamy and heavy. I had the sorbet trio of blueberry, blood orange and avocado with mango, and it was absolutely delightful!", "author": "Jennifer F."}

For some reason I expected the place to be a lot bigger but it was nice and modern inside. \n\nOur server was nice enough to explain the menu and bring out different cuts of the wagyu to see for ourselves. Ended up starting off with truffle fries which were really good. We were also brought out a small sample of a date wrapped in bacon and it was tiny but flavorful and delicious. Next we were given sorbet to cleanse the palette before we were served our NY trip steak. The steak was a little tough for a medium but still good. The presentation was nice as well. For our side we choose mashed potatoes. It was really good, especially with the bits of thick bacon in it. Overall a nice birthday dinner. The server was attentive and the other workers were prompt with always refilling your drink. For dessert we were stuffed but I got a complimentary dessert for my birthday. I was really surprised when they brought out the plate and it had my name on it. I thought it was a really special touch. We were also brought out mini blueberry madelines and macadamia nut cookies. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed this place. I liked how attentive they are and all the mini samples sent to the table inbetween each course. I also liked that the prices (with the exception of the wagyu) weren't too expensive.

The restaurant has a cool round shape so the atmosphere is pretty much like a lounge with dim lighting and of course a section for the bar. \n\nThe waiter was nice and informative about the menu which we enjoyed because all 5 of us had ordered something different. We had 2 types of bread which were delicious (bacon bread & sourdough). They also brought out a mini salmon tartar that I didn't really enjoy because it tasted like salmon fat/oil on a cucumber but its complimentary. For the appetizer we ordered the truffle fries and they were delicious.\n\nThe entrees took a while because of my Bone In Rib Eye Steak which was 32 oz. It was hugeeee and I could not finish it so it was worth the wait but my friends were not too happy. It was cooked perfectly to how I liked The flavor was good but subtle to me. We had the Mac & Cheese and we added Lobster for the side. It was okay but not as what I expected.\n\nOverall, I would like to give this place 4 stars for the atmosphere and customer service.

He parked the car on the left side of the street.\n\nA couple of hours later upon finishing dinner it was probably around 10pm. I walk around the car (mind you it's dark), I didn't see anything obvious so I tipped the valet guy another $10 for doing a good job(so I thought). The valet guy was reluctant to take my tip, and I didn't think much of it. Maybe he felt tipping him twice was too much? Who knows. At this time, the car was parked on the right side of the street directly in front of the restaurant. It was cold and windy as San Francisco generally is, I didn't waste any time being outside trying to inspect the car. \n\nThe next morning I'm heading towards the car to go to work, I realize that there is a fresh curb mark on the tire and the wheel. I then realize why the valet guy was so hesitant to take the extra tip. I give 5A5 a call and tell them what happened, and they took my info and nothing has happened since then.

We came in about 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and was told that our table would be ready at the time we made our reservation. After being seated, we were served drinks -- either regular tap water or sparkling water. My boyfriend is someone who eats a lot, so we kind of over ordered. We ordered two appetizers, the lobster tempera and the truffle fries. Dude, the lobster temper was soooooo good. Highly recommend! Saw some yelp reviews and our server told us that it's quite popular. The truffle fries were also awesome. I didn't really understand why truffles were so hyped until i actually tried some. They're very fragrant -- as we also ordered the truffles mac and cheese (thumbs up)!! We ordered an order of the A5 Wagyu Ribeye, A5 Wagyu Filet, and their Dry Aged T-Bone steak. AND BOYYYYY, it is soooooo goooood. both of the A5 Wagyu were so soft and literally melts in your mouth!! The Dry Aged T-Bone also gets a thumbs up! The bacon jam and the poached egg they put on it is sooo delicious. I wasn't too big of a fan of the bacon mashed potatoes, but my boyfriend loved it. We definitely over ordered, we didn't realize that the food would be quite heavy until we actually ate it. We took everything for togo, and our server packed our food and placed it into a paper bag.

To start our evening we waited approximately 10 minutes before our drink order was taken then it took about 15 minutes for our server to come back to the table to take our appetizer order. We made sure to order appetizers and our main courses all at once because we didn't know when he'd back. The appetizers were the best part of the meal. I recommend the lobster tempura and the hamachi spoon, they were really good and the best part of the evening. The main course was unspectacular. The steaks were cooked to temperature but lacking in taste and the sides were mediocre at best. \n\nOur server was knowledgeable, unfortunately he was inattentive and when I told him my wedge salad was never brought out he apologized profusely.

Since it was my sisters birthday, she decided to order a cocktail.

The way he said it was more of a rude remark than a flattering one. Uh, okay? This guy had a serious f*cking attitude.\n\nWe started off with the hamachi shots. Weird how it was served on a plate without any spoons or a shot glass. I think that defeats the purpose of it being called hamachi SHOTS.

That is a hallmark of excellent service.  \n\nWe started with soup as an appetizer which was a lobster bisque for myself and a truffle mac and cheese for my friend. My issue with most lobster bisques is that they are lacking lobster flavor. Their lobster bisque definitely packed a flavor punch. In the timeless words of Guy Fieri,,, we were in flavortown! Although, I am not a fan of adding a fancy ingredient to a basic food (truffle mac n cheese) and quadrupling the price. \n\nNext our entree came. We all ordered the filet mignon. It was the most tender piece of meat I have ever had. We ordered sides of wild mushroom and portobello mushroom caps. The portobello's were far more gastronomically satisfying than the wild mushrooms. I found the wild mushrooms to be a little tough and possibly overcooked. Typically, the fibrous parts of the mushroom are expected to be cut out. \n\nOverall, the food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and I would definitely come back again if I was in the area and was looking for upscale dining.", "author": "Wesley S."}

Sat at the bar for cocktails and Happyhour bar eats before being escorted to our table. The hostess was so sweet and referred to my name from the minute I walked in to the minute I exited. Give her a raise!!!! \"Hello jane welcome to 5a5 steak lounge\" and two hours later as I exit \"have a good evening jane\". She remembered my name!! Plus points.\n\nHEFER STATS. \n\nROASTED MOCHI ($5) - happy hour price. Meh. Sounds interesting but it's not. It's a \"filler\" few bites of these will get you full. You don't want that if your eating dinner here. \n\nOYSTER ($5) - happy hour price, four pieces. Be good to know when asking bar staff what kind of oysters instead of \"I don't know maybe Pacific\" to actually know the oyster of the night. Oysters from WA seem to be less creamy and more \"sea\" tasting. By the taste, I believe they were from the north Pacific. \n\nFILET MIGNON ($29/6oz) - medium. I love the filet Mignon cut because it's the most tender piece. Also, I judge a place by their preparation of this widely known steak. 6oz when cooked shrinks to appearing like 4oz but I felt like this was the smallest 6oz of cooked meat I ever received as it looked like 2oz. It was dressed with floral pedals and baby arugula and sauce. It was tasty, tender but not the most tender I've ever had, and maybe I should have went medium-rare. You come to a steak place for the quality and taste of meat, the extra stuff was a nice addition BUT sometimes the sauce kind of masked the meat. \n\nRIB EYE ($31) - medium. Brandy peppercorn sauce shiitake mushrooms. This was a larger cut and tasty. You have a heavier meat with some marbleization and fat and the taste is much meatier. Again, the extras on top like the sauce is a little too much when you come to a steak place and you pay for the meat. Perhaps, little drizzle on top and served the rest on the side. \n\nCRIMINI ($13) - leeks and port wine sauce. Honestly, I didn't see leeks. The leek flavor was in the port wine sauce nuked all over the mushrooms. \n\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS ($10) - I forgot the long name of this side but it was yummy Brussels sprouts with lemon flavor and other seasoning. They were over roasted and had good charred ends!!! \n\nPANNA COTTA ($13) - everytime I see panna cotta I cannot refuse dessert. I got a very soft spot for it. It was very soft and silky, dressed with this orange sauce swirled all over the plate. Panna cotta by itself is amazing and sauces can emphasize flavor or kill it. The sauce was so tangy and when eaten with the panna cotta it tasted like fruit loops but not. \n\nWill I be back? Hmmm sure. Alexander's is still my favorite.\n\nUntil the next review.", "author": "Jane A."}

Our experience was excellent from the moment we walked into the door.  The hostess was friendly and welcoming.  We were seated promptly for our 6:15 reservation on a Friday.  Our waiter was awesome!  Very attentive, friendly, down to earth.  The service overall was impeccable.  Napkins folded every time we went to the bathroom, water glasses filled without asking.  \n\nThe food was amazing.  We ordered the truffle fries and steak tartare to start.  Both were delicious and the portions were great for an upscale restaurant.  The house bread consisted of bacon bread and a sourdough bread.  Both were yummy, esp the bacon bread!  Just the right amount of bacon and first time we've seen this served at a restaurant as their house bread.  Can't go wrong there lol.  My gf had the A5 wagyu filet 4 oz.  It was on the pricey side, but soooooo worth it.  The flavor was decadent and it melted in your mouth.  It was served with the perfect amount of complementing truffle risotto on top.  We appreciate that 5A5 serves whole steaks of A5 wagyu--it's hard to find in bay area.  I had the 10 oz prime rib--it was cooked perfectly, nice thick cut, and can rival just about any prime rib in SF.   We had their mashed potatoes (super creamy) and creamed spinach for our sides--again super delish.  My only critique was for their mashed potatoes--the bites of maple bacon made it a bit sweet for my taste.  For dessert they brought out a very nice complimentary house dessert with Happy Birthday writing on the plate.  The dessert had real edible flowers on it and the brownie/cake was light and tasty.  We also ordered the tropical fruit dessert.  This dessert was by far one of the best we've ever had!  It didn't look too appetizing at first, but oh man--the flavors were amazing!  And it had the best boba balls I've ever had lol.  The presentation was super cool--it came in a stemless wine glass placed on it's side sitting on rocks of sugar.  For cocktails we had Japanese whiskey--Nikka malt and grain per our waiter's recommendation.  Not as smooth as we hoped for, but they were made table side which was awesome!  He used this copper device to mold our large ice sphere for our drinks.  So cool!  We also had the A5 Sazerac--Akashi White Oak Japanese Whisky, A5-Infused Cabernet Reduction, Truffle Oil.  This cocktails was so yummy!  Great blend of flavors.  We also received complementary bites in between our dishes--ceviche, some fruit dessert, and madeline cookies :)\n\nAmazing experience.

The bone- less rib eye was perfect for me, I was able to finish the whole thing but it took some time as it was very filling. Both ribs were really tasty and cooked perfectly to our preference of medium well. As for the lobster mac I thought it was ok but really pricey. \n\nService was great!

He couldn't get over how mouth watering that picture looked so we decided to come here for our anniversary. \n\nWhat We Ordered:\n\n- Complimentary Bread! Plain bread and Bacon bread. The Bacon Bread was really unique and it was quite tasty. It was a bit salty for my tasting but it was really worth a try!\n\n- 28 Ounce Bone In Rib-Eye Steak. ($48) This piece of meat looked monstrous and it was definitely enough to share with two people. Beautiful presentation with delicious homemade Pico De Gayo on top. The meat was well marinated and had an explosion of flavor once you took the first bite. I can't imagine a piece of steak getting better than that!\n\n- 10 Ounce Prime Rib. ($28). When I first tried ordering the Prime Rib, the waitress warned me that there was a possible chance they were sold out. Apparently they only cook one roast per night.  LUCKILY there was 2 slices left when we arrived! The Prime Rib was amazing and loved the Rosemary Au Jus that complimented the meat. I just want more!\n\n- Truffle Oil Mac and Cheese with Lobster Tail. ($24) THE STAR DISH OF THE NIGHT. The Lobster definitely gave the Mac and Cheese an amazing touch. The lobster was cooked to perfection and it was really worth the $24! Pricey for a side dish I must say but it was really worth it. The chef did a wonderful job choosing the right cheeses and seasoning the lobster. I definitely need to come back and order more! \n\n- Creamed of Spinach ($10). The Creamed of Spinach was a bit dry for me and not as moist as I would have expected compared to House of Prime. It was a still good side dish and went well with the Prime Rib.\n\nA+ for our waitress being a sweetheart and explaining everything on the menu for us. \nShe knew about everything on the menu from how all the food was made/cooked to how much food would be enough for the boyfriend and I. She definitely helped make our experience at 5A5 a good one. Our waitress also gave us free dessert for our anniversary which I thought was really sweet of her!  Who doesn't love free dessert?!\n\nAlso rumors were spreading saying that the quality of Alexander's Steakhouse has gone downhill because the Executive Chef has left to come to 5A5 Steak Lounge. I can now verify that the rumors are true. Chef Allen Chen is a brilliant man.", "author": "MyTien P."}

I received a gift card to this restaurant and Ken L. and I decided to give it a try a month ago for dinner on a Sunday. We made reservations ahead of time although it didn't seem like we needed it when we walked it. There were only a couple of tables occupied and we were given the option to eat in the main room or in a darker, more intimate area in the back. We opted for the main room since there was more lighting. \n\nThe service was great here. Everyone was very nice and attentive. We ordered the prime rib (10 oz) and boneless rib-eye. If you want sides for your meat, you need to order them separately. Since we weren't too hungry, Ken L. and I opted to just split the truffled mac and cheese. While we waited for our food, we were brought warm yummy bacon and sourdough bread. In addition, the chef also sent a complementary sample of their salmon mousse.\n\nWhile I'm not the biggest meat eater, I loved the prime rib. It was nicely flavored, not over-cooked, and I actually finished the whole 10 oz. by myself. Ken L.'s rib-eye was pretty good too. The truffled mac and cheese was rich and cheesy and splitting it was just enough for me without feeling overwhelmed by cheese. \n\nFor dessert, we chose the mint ice cream creme brulee. It was okay but definitely my least favorite of our entire meal. \n\nOverall, the ambiance, food, and service at 5A5 was wonderful. I would definitely love to come back again.", "author": "Steph F."}

We booked our reservation not really knowing what were getting into and were very out of our element when looking at the menu for a few reasons. It is a thorough menu having both warm and cold starters, entrees and then what I would call super entrees that are steaks on a whole new level of quality and cut, we did not try these super steaks because they were also on a whole new price level! We each ordered the filet which was more than tasty and just wow. We split a side order of mashed potatoes which were like no potatoes we had ever had before! Our server Graham went above and beyond to make sure we had plenty of gluten free options and we felt good about what we ate. Great drinks, a knowledgeable, friendly and professional staff made our night! The sorbet trio was interesting, I loved it but the flavors weren't so much to my SO's liking, I think I'll try the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e next time. Huge shout out to Graham for walking us through the menu and making 5A5 possible for us! Great atmosphere and noise level, lighting was low and perfect, I highly recommend!", "author": "Aj L."}

My out of town friend suggested steak and I obliged, probably too hastily. It was raining, quite heavily, in San Francisco on Thu night. And it showed when we got to the restaurant - Between 7 pm and 10 pm, the restaurant was never more than 25% full and being the quiet and slow night, I expected service to be prompt and with no mistakes and, that it was. \n\nThe Food\nI myself, don't care much for steak, but the marbled Wagyu meat cuts looked amazing. I chose Salmon, as is typical for me now, especially since I am trying to commit to getting leaner. The salmon I chose and that was served to me was tasty - the portions were not generous, so I felt I could have eaten more. My friend chose a cut of meat, I can't remember which and his response when I asked him how he found it was, that it was good as well. So I start the review at 3 stars.\n\nThe Ambiance\nThe decor is modern and inviting, with a balance between the lighting contrasting the furniture, with red, yellow and orange accents that made the experience inviting. Because of that, I add 1/2 star. Now, we're up to 3 and 1/2. \n\nService\nYou know how the waiter, as well as anyone else whose job it is to check on your beverages, water, and other side elements, as well as the Maitre D' come over to check in on you and say hello - well, it just felt contrived. The ensemble of characters, including our waiter who would come to check on us, were nice and polite. However, it didn't get me emotionally connected to the place. So +1/2 stars for this one, bringing the score total to 4 stars so far.\n\nExceptional Note\nOne exceptional moment we had was at the reception table, where Ray, a young black woman from Detroit, who greeted us, beamed with character so authentic, gentle and real, it made me wish she was all at once the Maitre D', our waiter and someone who could come over and sit at our table, even for a little bit. Not enough to convert the experience to 5 stars, since our interaction was limited to less than 30 seconds. If there's hope, it's for the people at the restaurant to figure out how to diffuse her character into the ambiance pervasively enough, without overpowering their seemingly strong desire to maintain a sort of posh and what I perceive to be too cold a sophistication.", "author": "Fadi A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-03", "description": "Went here today for my birthday with my family and I must say the quality of beef here was truly amazing. The main course I ordered was the F1 Tajima NY steak which was the half (Holstein and Wagyu) and for the appetizer I ordered the Aussie Wagyu Sashimi. My father ordered the T-bone and my sister and Mom shared the Ribeye. For sides and appetizers we all shared the Truffle Fries, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. All these dishes were quite amazing and left your tongue on a flavor trip.\n \n-I'll now break down each of these dishes-\n\nStarting off with the Aussie Wagyu Sashimi this dish was one of those things where your palate was just sitting in confusion wondering what the heck did I just eat?! The whole time I kept on thinking that I was eating fish because of how the meat literally MELTED in your mouth!! The Wagyu was on a small bed of mushrooms and jicama. This Combination of beef and vegetables was very nice because the vegetables were coated in the melty Wagyu  as you chewed which then just added another depth of flavor as if the vegetables have been cooked with the beef!  So for this dish I would most definitely recommend to try the flavors were truly amazing it was a nice way to expose my palate to the pure flavor of the beef since it was raw.\n\nNow for the shared Truffle Fries these were like the most hyped things I saw as an appetizer prior to coming.  I must say these were actually pretty good the combination of the fries and the rich creamy siracha aioli kinda just married the 2 flavors together perfectly. There's not much to say about fries lol but like the only comment I would have which is kinda small but they are a bit to salty but that's just preference.\n\n-I'll start with my dish first the others I just sampled so there's not as much to say..-\n\nSo as said before I had the F1 Tajima NY steak for dinner the 4oz version. This dish was truly divine the quality and expertise of cooking was amazing. The Tajima was served with a really nice and savory brown sauce as well as a nice light herbal green sauce intertwined with each other and 3 slightly cooked tomatoes to top it off. So the first bite of the steak the flavors were just bursting out of it gushing with flavor. This was one of the boldest and tender steaks I've ever had. With this steak you really tell the flavors the chefs were trying to show off which was the pure essence of beef. I ordered the steak rare and you would think with the normal steak it would still be a bit tough but since the marbling in this steak was so high even for being just half Wagyu it still melted in your mouth immediately. I don't think there was a single tough part of the meat. This dish was definitely a great eye opener to the greater steak world because up to this point I've only had a 90 day dry aged NY. Although next time I would like to creep up on to the pure Wagyu meats I would most definitely reccomend the Tajima NY steaks.\n\nThis is going to be really short for the the Ribeye and T-bone but let's just say if you love the salty and sweet play of beef the T-bone is perfect for you. While as the Ribeye was the style I like the most which is the salty and pepper play which is just a nice salt and pepper seasoning prior to cooking well at least that's what I got from it. Each steak was very good but they're just in a different tier than the Wagyu and Tajima.\n\nFor desert we had the chocolate oreo pie and the complimentary chocolate cake for my birthday. Both of them were quite good but I would like to give props to our waiter who reccomended the oreo pie! This pie was a great play on the classic oreo because it was 2 layers of chocolate with a rich vanilla bean filling. It was topped with carmel and toasted marshmallow. The flavors of all these flavors together were amazing it wasn't to heavy but it was just light enough to end the night happy!", "author": "Andrew U."}

The steaks were top notch, the same quality as Roka Akor. \n\nThis time, we felt we ate at Outback. (I haven't been to an Outback since college. Outback possibly serves better steaks.) \n\nThe hamachi shots, the salads, the entrees taste cheaply made with inferior ingredients.\n\nThe heirloom burrata salad had very little burrata. It's just a pile of tomatoes without any flavor.no efforts were put into this dish. \n\nThe free bites were overly seasoned, so sweet and overpowering. It was gross.\n\nThe lobster tempura  was the only acceptable dish.\n\nThe New York steak looked so sad. It looked like the meat had sat in the kitchen for a week. It tastes chewy.  We couldn't finish it.\n\nThe sweet potato gnocchi was very salty and heavy. It's not SF cooking. It's more of \"fancy\" Midwest cooking.  \n\nThis was a very disappointing experience.  We rarely visit the same restaurant more than once a year because there are so many cool new ones to try.  This return trip was horrifying.

The decor is in my lounge of future zone and metallics and a fun, playful way.  It was the kind of place that you didn't feel badly if you bothered to dress up a bit.  But who cares? It's really all about the steak.  My personal proclivities when it comes to the matter may be considered odd or d\u00e9class\u00e9, however I have tried many different types of steak.  I have never been wowed by Wagyu or Kobe, and since this was a first date I wanted to keep my order in the slightly less than astronomical price range.  As such, I ordered the basic filet.  And WOW.  I'm very happy that I did.  It was absolutely delicious.  It was everything that I wanted and more.  Also, the server brought out a small bite of some sort of tuna with sesame seeds and it was utterly fantastic.\n\nI am something of a steak addict and have gone to many steak houses and both New York City and around the country.

Managed to get a reservation (thanks JC!). Arrived and was greeted with a round of drinks on the house. Awesome way to start the evening. \n\nWe started off with Wagyu Sliders. Buns tasted fresh, meat was tender, overall flavor was well-balanced. What I really enjoyed were the truffle fries and aioli dipping sauce. \n\nAlso, chef provided a amuse-bouche of a seared tuna, I believe. Tasted fresh and flavorful\n\nAt this point, we popped open a bottle of Auteur Pinot Noir. I think it was a 2013. I asked Ali, our server, for a recommendation of a smooth finishing pinot to go with all the meat we were about to consume. Pretty good recommendation. \n\nMain courses included an 8 oz A5 Ribeye, a few Filet Mignons, and a few of the monstrous 32 oz Bone-In Ribeye. I don't think anyone finished the 32 ouncer. I didn't get to try it, but one person thought there was too much tendon and lacked tenderness. I can say the A5 Ribeye was definitely a worthwhile experience. Cooked exactly as I asked. Had not had the pleasure of an A5 cut of meat before. The marbleization was so even all the way through. Funny thing is that even if money were no object, I'm not sure that I would want to eat it often. The amount of fat on the meat made it tender to the point that it was almost too tender. Is there such a thing? \n\nIn addition to the meat, we added cauliflower, asparagus, creamy spinach, truffle mac and cheese, and sweet potato gnocchi. I didn't get to the cauliflower. Asparagus was nice and thin and tender. Creamy spinach was standard fare. Mac & cheese seemed to have different cheese varieties, which made it tasty, though could have used more of a crust. Gnocchi was not a huge hit, but tasted decent enough. \n\nThe 32 oz ribeye with tendon and lacked tenderness was mentioned and they gave us a credit for a few of the sides. Surprising move given the level of the restaurant. Expected a comp, especially since the diner didn't even finish half the steak and gave up. To be fair they offered another ribeye. \n\nThis leads me to the service, where everything came out in a very timely manner and all our needs were more than met. Plates were cleared regularly. Definitely worth the money in this category. \n\nWould I recommend this restaurant? Definitely. If nothing else, you have to try the A5 Ribeye, truffle fries with aioli, sliders, and the fantastic service.", "author": "drew c."}

I had wanted to try something on the level of Alexander's or Bobo's. It was quite easy to secure a reservation on a Saturday night. \n\nThe steaks are quite alright! TBH the prime rib was the best out of all of our dishes, but still not as delicious as HOPR. I would classify 5A5 as your typical steakhouse with typical steakhouses prices but nothing memorable. I do like the general ambience of the restaurant and the roundabout seating. The GM on duty during our dining session was especially friendly but service was pretty slow. We wanted to get a dessert, but by the time the server came back with our dessert menus, our moods were dampened and we just wanted to get out of there. It then took another 15 minutes to come back with our bill. \n\nOverall, the steaks are cooked well but nothing special.

It's quite smaller than how I imagined it, very dim intimate lighting. Our waitress was extremely nice! Probably one of the best service I've ever gotten, not only from our waitress but from the other servers as well. They were all attentive and helpful with choosing what sides to order or what kind of meat to get. My boyfriend went to the restroom and he left his napkin on the seat and a server came and folded it up and placed back on table, just an example for how attentive they were! The food was delicious!!! I highly recommend the oysters they were amazing. Who would've thought apples on oysters would taste so good? For our sides we ordered the truffle mac & cheese w lobster (amazing-totally worth it), asparagus (ehh we didn't really touch it), and the schrooms (this was delicious! I love mushrooms so if you do also then order this!) the steaks we ordered were delicious! I got the dry aged t bone and my bf got the bone in ribeye. The t bone was amazing but it had this jam sauce type of thing that I wasn't a huge fan of but the steak was cooked perfectly and overall it was amazing. The bone in ribeye was perfection. Taking one bite of bfs steak, I was like shoot I should have ordered this! \nUpon making the reservation, I requested to have a cake with \"Happy birthday baby!!!\" On it. When our waitress brought out the cake he was so shocked! It was a little chocolate brownie with edible flowers and cream. My bf hates chocolate but he enjoyed this dessert because the chocolate wasn't too sweet and the cream added that perfect balance of sweetness. \nIf you're looking to splurge to celebrate an anniversary, birthday or if you just want some steak then I highly recommend this place!!! I know it's pricey (the bill with 2 steaks, 2 appetizers, 3 sides and a couple of drinks came out to be $300) it was worth it but definitely not budget friendly lol", "author": "Stefhanie D."}

Is it appropriate to say it was like a party in my mouth?\n\nAussie wagyu sashimi - this dish finally settled my curiousity for wagyu. The dish was very well balanced, but I'm not sure if I am that crazy about wagyu. \n\nBoneless ribeye - the sauce was to die for! My steak turned our very tender and juicy.\n\nMashed potato - If you enjoy the softer texture of mashed potatoes then I would highly recommend this. The candied bacon and melted cheese was the bomb dot com.\n\nCheesecake - nice and fluffy, it was really good with the guava sorbet.\n\nOverall, this was a very memorable experience.

By the time he brought our waters we ended up ordering fast Bcuz who knew when he was going to be back. Not to mention our waiter was impatient, very short and kind rude! Then when we got our food we were NOT impressed at all! We didn't say anything but asked for the check and left ASAP.

I will say that this place and Alexander's are the only places in the city that I know of where one can get Wagyu beef. Alexander's also has American Kobe which I did not see on the menu here - although they did have 50% Wagyu and 50% Holstein.\n\nLong story short, we got the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye and also the Hybrid Wagyu/Holstein NY. I enjoy tasting hybrids first to experience a pretty good texture and then go for the kill in the wagyu - such soft creamy smoothness. And of course, prepared rare.\n\nGot a beet salad with fries as well which wasn't bad.\n\nOverall I don't mind this place at all - it was actually pretty good. I would say it is somewhat more casual (a little louder and not as formal) than Alexander's but it's a lounge, so I didn't expect any different. I would prefer Alexander's though over this.", "author": "Julia P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-14", "description": "+/- THE FOOD\nWe ordered a variety of appetizers, including the truffle fries, hamachi plate, Shigoku oysters, and A5 wagyu tartare. Our favorite was definitely the truffle fries because it was so perfectly crispy and the Sriracha aioli dipping was delicious. Either the hamachi plate or Shigoku oysters came in second. Both were a bit too flavored so it covered up the natural taste of the seafood, but everything was still fresh and interesting.  We didn't love the wagyu beef plate as much because it was a bit flavorless. For the main course, I had the dry aged bone in New York steak, and I absolutely loved it! There was so much flavor and the steak was so juicy when cooked medium rare. The bacon jam on top was delicious because it was slightly sweet and contrasted the savory steak. I tried small pieces of the other steaks (T-bone and ribeye), and those were too overpowered by other flavors. \n\n+ THE SERVICE\nExcellent service here. All the servers are extremely welcoming and check up on your table a good amount. Upon hearing that it was our first time here, they gave us a brief explanation of the menu. Once in a while, they would bring small dishes out from the kitchen for us to try. When you leave your seat to use the restroom, they'll even fold your cloth napkins nicely! \n\n+ THE ENVIRONMENT\nLovely place with tasteful decor. Nice leather couches and comfortable seats. Dim lighting and candles make the meal very intimate feeling. The bathroom is located downstairs and is more of like alternating men and women stalls- kinda interesting because it's technically just one bathroom.", "author": "Cindy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-30", "description": "Is lukewarm the new black? More frequently as of late, I find myself at an upscale restaurant that serves something pricey and carnivorous, and what arrives is barely above room temperature. Did somebody famous decide this was the new culinary trend, an offshoot of the raw food movement perhaps? Maybe because I'm a suburban Sizzler type of guy, I expect flame-broiled and piping hot on my plate, not fashionably cool with a coral shade of pink inside. Yes, I've belabored the point, but this is the type of steakhouse 5A5 is. In fact, it's not a steakhouse but a \"steak lounge\", you plebeian cannibal.\n\nI came here with Jamie W. to celebrate his best buddy Ed's big 40th birthday.. There were five of us seated in one of their large semicircular booths. The decor is the direct opposite of an old-school steakhouse like Alfred's. The all-white upholstery banquettes feel very sleek and chic with the centerpiece the retro-looking spaceship light fixture in the middle of the ceiling, the one with the pink and orange polka-dots (photo: http://bit.ly/ZZCpNt). I didn't waste any time in ordering one of their cocktails, the $13 Bourbon Baked Apple, an obscenely good concoction of Makers Mark 46, apple juice, bitters, lemon juice, spiced syrup, and ginger beer (photo: http://bit.ly/13InKJt).\n\nStarting with the complimentary house-baked bread (photo: http://bit.ly/13InV7E), the appetizers were all quite tasty, and we ordered a good variety. The $7 Shishito Peppers turned out to be an abundant plate with the shaved bonito flakes still dancing from the heat and the kabayaki sauce a nice Asian touch as it's mainly used in unagi sushi (photo: http://bit.ly/ZP9osc). The $9 Iceberg Lettuce Salad was classic steakhouse but presented in a fusion manner with the lettuce presented as opening blossoms with the smoked bacon bits, hard-boiled egg and julienned Fuji apple blended into the lighter-than-norm Russian dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/10R2FA1).\n\nA designated victor among our party were the $17 Bacon Wrapped Scallops, just four of them to be shared among five hungry people, but still nicely accessorized with maple kabocha and cocoa vinaigrette along with a smear of aioli (photo: http://bit.ly/ZTfqH0). However, my personal favorite was the $11 Tako Salad, which was a rather hefty plate of sliced octopus, daikon, cucumber, tomato, and wakame (sea food), all of it marinated in a kimchi vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/18iVRIT). Up to this point, the dinner was on its way to a solid four stars and then some given some of the generous quantities served. The steaks somehow managed to disappoint in the margins, a bit of a bummer given the pre-visit hype.\n\nAfter the waiter pitched us with the supposedly orgasmic joys of A5 Wagyu presented in their raw, marbled state on a wooden plank,  we all settled on our comparatively cheaper meat selections. Two people ordered the $29 six-ounce Filet Mignon with the demi glace and tarragon beurre fondue, and both were taken aback at the lukewarm state of the meat. Neither felt compelled to send the steak back, flavorful as the steaks were, lest they be informed that the lower temperature was intentional. Jamie surprised me by ordering the $25 ten-ounce Slow Roasted Prime Rib, intensely pink with a garlic-mustard rub (photo: http://bit.ly/ZiqJVS). Not bad but clearly not a specialty of the house.\n\nI ordered the $31 Boneless Ribeye Steak medium-rare with green peppercorn sauce and shiitake mushroom. Lacking real distinction, it was underwhelming with its business-class flight presentation (photo: http://bit.ly/156wL3N). As a consequence, the sides were not doing it for me either even though they were all reasonably good. The $9 Haricot Vert had a nice Asian snap with ginger, shallot, and fish sauce mixed in with crispy won ton strips lending good if predictable contrast (photo: http://bit.ly/11yMaUe). The $9 Saut\u00e9ed Swiss Chard (photo: http://bit.ly/11U7R1l) and the $10 Mashed Potato with Japanese curry gravy (photo: http://bit.ly/ZirfDi) were both decent if lacking the creative flair of the appetizers.\n\nThe most satisfying side dish was the $10 Truffled Mac & Cheese baked with gruyere, mozzarella, and cheddar (photo: http://bit.ly/YaGm4i). You would think desserts would be off the table but no. Not only did Ed receive his free birthday cake, but we shared the $8 Pineapple Upside-Down Cake with scoops of lime-coconut and toasted coconut ice cream and a pineapple-vanilla confit (photo: http://bit.ly/100ARSc). A couple of amuse bouches finished off the meal - spoonfuls of Kumquat Marmalade (photo: http://bit.ly/Zxh8Ou) and a plate of small Madeleines with guava jelly cubes (photo: http://bit.ly/12O4E52).\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a strong start but the meal took a turn with a lackluster ribeye\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...sleek and clubby...not your dad's ye olde steakhouse\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very attentive and conscientious\nTOTAL - 3 stars...fashionably swanky steak lounge needs to rediscover its inner steakhouse", "author": "Ed U."}

After proposing to my now fiance, we went to 5A5 for dinner. From the welcome to the door to the on-point and knowledgeable staff to the delicious food, everything was perfect. A few days earlier I called the restaurant to let them know about our special occasion where they informed me that everything would be taken care of including a special spot \"under the dome\" in the center of the restaurant and a special treat. \n\nThe manager and wait-staff followed through with their promise with an incredible spot at the center of the restaurant. We began our meal with a wonderful bottle of champagne, lobster ragoons, and multiple random appetizers from the restaurant. For our main course we had the large rib-eye with the macaroni and cauliflower sides. Everything was unique, flavorful, warm, perfectly cooked, and beautifully displayed.\n\nAt the end of our meal, both of us were full and didn't want dessert. However, the manager went ahead and brought us not one but TWO complimentary desserts for the special occasion. These were unnecessary but equally impressive as the rest of the meal. Needless to say, we both stuffed down the desserts!\n\nAs a final note, I want everyone to know that this restaurant now has a customer for life. I've been lucky enough to try many of the best steakhouses in the USA including Manny's in Minnesota. However, this has pushed itself up to my #1 spot.

So we tell one of the guys at the host desk that we had reservations at 5:30 and they told us if we wanted we could sit at the bar.  So I order a rum and coke and the wife gets a cosmo.  So 5:40 rolls by and still sitting at the bar...luckily the bartender was really nice and offered to go check with the hostess about getting us seated.  \n\nSo we eventually get seated and our waiter brings out a board with the different meats they offer, which was cool.  The waiter takes our order and here's where I wish they would have asked if we wanted certain things at different points during the meal.  So they did bring out a small dish of something fancy, which was really good and then we got our truffle fries followed by the pallet cleanser 5 minutes later and our steaks and mac and cheese about 5 minutes after that.  Seemed a little bit out of order since I would have preferred the fries with dinner.  Not a big deal but for a fancy place you'd expect it.\n\nThe wife ordered Prime Rib, which was not cooked the way she wanted.  The prime rib was supposed to be medium and was actually cooled well done.  Center had absolutely no red in the middle.  I ordered Tajima F1 Fillet and NY which were both good but I found the NY cut a lot better than the Fillet.  One other thing that was kind of off was that the truffle oil in the mac and cheese was way to overpowering and made eating it a little hard.\n\nI really had high hopes for this place.  The menu looked really good but it was sort of a let down.  From being forgotten by the hostess to the poor execution of some of the food will make me pass on this place in the future.

Besides the company of fabulous friends, the ambiance was modern, yet warm and profoundly sophisticated.  Surrounded by beautiful piano music emanating from the center of the lounge, I couldn't resist the pleasant thoughts of the exciting weekend ahead of us, in gorgeous San Francisco!\n\nBefore being escorted to our table, our coats were nicely received and hung out of sight.  The pleasant and friendly waitstaff, all the more, made for a wonderful evening.\n\nBoth Tony and his good friend are avid wine conneseurs.  They treated their lovely wives to two bottles from home:  1998 Dominus & 2006 Jana Cathedral Red, each having a $25 corkage fee.  It was worth every drop of service charge, as their aged wine was divine!\n\nWe started the evening off with an amuse bouche of skewered Filet Mignon.

The lobster was lightly coated and fried to a perfectly crispy seafood \"crunchiness\".  The Shishito peppers grilled with kabayaki (sweet soy sauce based) sauce, and bonito flakes.  Note:  the larger peppers, with the mature seeds can be a bit spicy.  Stick with the small pepper pieces if you prefer it mild.  My ribeye steak was so juicy, perfectly prepared to a medium rare.  Topped with a miso mustard demi glaze, shishito pesto and pickled ginger made this ribeye unique and not your typically prepared steak.  It was a good 12 oz. size, leaving my husband the pleasure of finishing off the remaining few bites.

Look at the digestifs: the cheapest is Grand Marnier for 10$. It's not even good and the bottle is 20$. Remy Martin XO 60$?? Yes this is upper class stuff but I can get the entire bottle for 120$. It's just unreasonable. In the end they even messed up the bill and put on tons of stuff we didn't order. When paying 200$(!!) per person I expect first class service and first class experience. Definitely not coming back and definitely not recommending", "author": "N H."}

The food and service was great but I don't expect to come across any RODENTS running around from table to table through the dining room floor. The service by Scott R was good up until my friend pointed out the mouse underneath one of the dining room tables as we were leaving. He then addressed it to his manager and disappeared to the back. Who knows if the place is infested with more mice as we only saw one. It made my stomach turn upside down as soon as I saw it. You would think the manager would come to us and feel apologetic about the situation but instead he just told us it probably came from the housing units above the restaurant. I expected more from a manager of this type of establishment to handle the situation much better. He just tried to brush off the situation as though nothing was wrong.", "author": "Rasheed B."}

At the corner of Jackson & Front there's valet for $15 as well as surrounding parking lots for the same price. As soon as we enter 5A5 we're greeted by a friendly host.  They have a coat rack, but didn't offer to take our coats. No biggie, there's plenty of space at our table. \n\nAs we are seated waters are served to us & shortly after our drink orders are taken.  It is not until we place our order that they give us bread. I wish it came sooner because their bacon bread is absolutely delicious. Our waiter, I forgot his name, is well versed in the meat they serve. He brings out a meat board of the different wagyu they offer & goes into detail about the variations. He sells me on the rib cap wagyu the moment he says \"melts in your mouth\". It's pricey, but definitely worth every cent!  \n\nWe start off with the truffle fries; they're fried to perfection. My boyfriend & I literally cleaned the basket out before our entr\u00e9es arrived. Everything about it was perfect: the cut, seasoning, crunchiness - everything!  Before my rib cap wagyu arrives I am handed a card containing information regarding my meat. It literally tells me the name as well as the names of the parents, a little weird but interesting none the less. \n\nMy boyfriend orders the NY strip steak medium-well. I get my rib cap medium-rare. Both are exceptionally juicy & tender. However, the wagyu is definitely better. Each bite is like butter; it feels like it melts as you bite into the meat.  The flavor is bursting through out my mouth. I am beyond satisfied with my order. The cream of spinach is the side we decided on & that too came out perfectly. \n\nIn between dishes they serve pallet cleansers. All are portioned properly & our waiter checked to see if either of us had any allergies. A plus in my book because I am one of those who suffers from food allergies. \n\nAll of the staff is very attentive; as soon as a plate is finished it is taken away & the table is cleared of any crumbs. If my water ran low it was quickly filled below the rim. \n\nOverall a very nice restaurant that pays close attention to details. Their food & service are exceptional. The restaurant & bathroom are well kept. There's nothing I can think of that is negative. I will definitely be returning to 5A5 to experience more of their menu.", "author": "Kathleen Y."}

That's why we chose 5A5 Steak Lounge for the quality, originality and experience. \n\nWe just so happened upon Dine About Town, which I have had here before. The deal is simply worth the cost of the steak alone and for the other courses, the meal is a must. \n\nThe chef starts you with an amuse bouche to entice you, ours was a mini meatball in a spoon. Our friend was allergic to gluten, so the kitchen accomadated that by providing an alternate amuse bouche of charred chile peppers. A nice twist. \n\nWe order an assortment of appetizer spoons. I have only had the hamachi spoons, so adding the lobster ceviche and the waygu tartare to try new bites were fun. All were unique and delicious, one perfect small taste in a spoon. \n\nAs our starter, my guy and I both ordered the iceburg salad. It was a beautiful mix of flavors and a great primer for the steaks we had coming. Our friend ordered the carrot ginger soup, which looked really creamy and good.  \n\nBetween courses, the kitchen continues to serve amuse bouches between courses like little surprises.The palate cleanser of a butternut squash passionfruit jelly in a spoon. Inventive combination of flavors, very smooth, slightly tart and refreshing. \n\nWe ordered the filet mignon and the NY strip steak as our main. I always opt for medium rare because they know how to cook a great steak and you really shouldn't ruin a great cut of meat by over cooking it. The flavor profile of the steak sauce is amazing, topped with edible flowers - freaking adorable. Yes, I'm in love....\n\nI ordered a Manhattan with my dessert, the Tapioca Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I'm a fan of the creme brulee and enjoyed the twist. Luckily our friend ordered the trio of sorbets, so I could try them. The apple was so crisp, the creme freiche was so creamy yet not sweet, the passionfruit was tropical and tangy. \n\nThe entire meal was incredible, the food was cooked to perfection, service was excellent, all with the best company.

Truffle Mac n cheese, mushrooms, and potato gratin. All were delicious.\n\n*Prime Rib- advertised as \"limited\" so I thought it was a must get. It came out cold and presentation was awful.

They closed the entire restaurant for the party which included passed hors d'oeuvres and drinks.  I was impressed with both the level of service and the quality of the food.  Even for passed appetizers, they were all plated beautifully and carefully.  Typically, I feel like there are never enough appetizers, but the servers were very attentive and made sure that they offered food to everyone, whether at the bar, sitting, or standing at the entrance to the kitchen waiting to pounce (because, let's be real, there was a whole group of ravenous people on the hunt for food).  They kept the appetizers going throughout the night and brought out some larger plates to set on tables so that people could come pick up food.  Very well orchestrated.\n\nMy favorites of the night:\n- Hamachi spoons - Wow.  This was absolutely delicious.  Uni, pickled seaweed, strawberry-kimchi furikake, aji ceviche, and ponzu.  Definitely my absolute favorite of the night.\n- Truffled Mac & Cheese mini bottles - deliciously creamy delights with a nice hint of truffle (without being too overpowering).  Loved the adorable glass bottles that they were served in.\n- Steak Bites - delightfully cooked medium-rare.  Tender, moist, and delicious.\n- Truffle Fries - 'nuff said.\n- Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp - These shrimp were ginormous.  Seriously, way larger than any appetizer shrimp I've ever seen plus they were wrapped in bacon!  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and were super delicious.\n- Ahi Tuna with Watermelon (and basil or mint, I think) Skewers - Great combination of flavors.  \n- Coffee eclairs - I think they had some sprinkles of pistachios on top too but they were filled with a light coffee cream inside and they were so delicious.  I literally snagged another one on the way out even though I was stuffed.\n\nI was also super impressed with the service.  There was a beer/wine table and also a cocktail bar.  I was standing and drinking white wine and as my glass was nearing its end, one of the servers walked over to me and offered more white wine.  Also, towards the end of service, the servers kept on trying to convince us to eat more.

My 4 year old nephew understands that. \n\nMy girlfriend and I ate here New Year's Eve.  I've eaten at a lot of different places over the years; from the very high end to lower end. This will go down as one of the worst experiences I've had...food wise.  I can't remember the last time I rushed through a meal because I just wanted to get it over with.  \n\nThe New York steak was chewy and cold.  The tangy sauce that they added over powered the meat.  The bone marrow, which I was really looking forward to, was horrendous.  It's like they cooked it hours before, let it sit on the counter and then through it in the microwave!  So easy to get that right, I couldn't believe it.\n\nThe lobster bisque was half way decent but very watered down.  \n\nThe squash ravioli was undercooked.\n\nThe fish was so undercooked and uneven my girlfriend couldn't finish but half of it.  \n\nThe only Pinot available by the glass, was good...but they didn't prepare it of course. Funny thing is the waiter was verbally explaining the wine, but given the noise in the place, I could hear him well. I had the wine menu in front of me the whole time. He could have easily grabbed the menu and pointed to it.\n\nSo, we hoped that the final course of the night, the bread pudding, would at least leave us with a smile as we walked out. Nope! It was terrible.\n\nWhen I got the bill, I damn near fell over. Of course, it was a prix fixe menu and I knew the cost beforehand. But that included high expectations! When we got our coats, I asked the older gentleman working the front desk how long the place had been opened. When he said 8 years, I nearly said out loud, but definitely thought \"seriously\"?  \n\nNonetheless, what a disaster. Felt bad for the waiter as it's not his fault the food was bad.

I have ate Wagyu at many other restaurants, and still it is the best here.  \n\nI have gone here with my boyfriend and we usually get 2 cuts of meat, and share.  One is the regular steak and the other is the Wagyu, and have them bring out one steak at a time.   If you decide to do this, we have found out (the hard way), you should go with the regular steak first and then follow up with the Wagyu.   The regular steaks are Amazing (again better then most restaurants out there).  It is hard to start out with one of the best steak you will ever eat (the Wagyu), and then go back to the regular.   \n\nIf your feeling adventurous, and hungry, get the A5 Experience.  It is four 4-oz. Wagyu Steaks on 1 plate.  So Good, and a great way to try different cuts of Wagyu.  This dish has to be my all time favorite dish ever!\n\nYou can get truffles shaved right on to your steak here too (yes real shaved truffles and not that truffle oil).  Makes your amazing steak even more amazing. \n\nAs for sides, the truffle Mac and Cheese with lobster is amazing.  I mean how can you go wrong with Mac and Cheese, and then you add in truffles and lobster... OMG!!!!  As well as the brussels sprouts are amazing too!\n\nAfter your meal is complete, you have to try one of their scotch!  They have all the most popular scotchs, as well as some Japanese whiskeys.  And make sure you get it over ice, because they come to your table with a cart that has all their scotchs and this machine that makes a sphere of ice!!!  They take this huge cube of ice and place it in the machine and then 1 minute later this perfect sphere of ice (that just barely fits into the glass) appears.  It is a great experience!\n\nThis place is also good for Happy Hour.  It's a great way to have a fancy Happy Hour!  It's from 5:00-7:00 Monday-Friday, and has $11 cocktails, $7 glasses of wine, $5 on select appetizers.   From the appetizers, I love the Truffle Fries with sriracha aioli here.  If your feeling hungry get the Wagyu sliders (it's not on the Happy Hour menu, but are so amazing).\n\nOne perk is that they do a free coat check as you enter into the restaurant so you don't have to hold onto your coat/have it on your chair during the meal!", "author": "Rose Z."}

They are open about 30 minutes prior to dinner (which starts at about 05:30pm) for people who would like to enjoy the bar or are waiting for dinner hours to begin. \n\nWe were enjoying some wine and bar bites when our table was ready. Since we were still munching, they told us to take our time and that our table is ready for us whenever we'd like to move there. They said they could move our tab from the bar/lounge to our table, so we picked up our glasses of wine and changed our location. It was a very nice change of lighting - dark bar/lounge area to a nicely lit dining area. \n\nA couple of random things: I noticed that this place is not-all-couple atmosphere. Yes, they put couples (at least for us) where we could talk and not be surrounded by others who were there with friends or family, but still maintained this nice not-too-intimate atmosphere. There is also a very talented pianist playing around the bar/lounge area during dinner hours - he plays classics, piano version of popular songs, etc. The music definitely added to the experience and I was glad that it was not just classical music being played. Oh, and there was always someone there to fold your napkin if you walked away to the restroom (which are downstairs) - I found it unnecessary since it was going to be unfolded again. \n\nANYWAY, our friendly server gave us our water option (sparkling or stilled) and was willing to explain anything on the menu (even pointed out some FYI's for us since it was our first time there). After our orders were placed, we were served food quite quickly, but it wasn't a hurry-up-and-leave quickly. The food (bar bites and dinner options) here were all very good - some better than others, but still full of flavor. I believe between the two of us, we tried a skewer that was on the house (forgot the name of it, but it was good), Malay Filet Skewers (happy hour menu), tuna tataki (small plate), hamachi and oyster (dinner menu bites), tajima f1 ny and tajima f1 fillet (both 4oz), creamy spinach (side), their breads (sourdough and bacon bread), 4 glasses of wine (1 from happy hour), 1 flight of dessert wine, panna cotta, and a chocolate dessert that was on the house. \n\nI was very surprised with the chocolate dessert. When I made the reservations on OpenTable, they have a spot for notes (like celebrations) which I was not expecting them to read since most places do not (but they did). They noted that it was my boyfriend and my anniversary, and elegantly piped chocolate around a small chocolate cake for us. It was really sweet and topped of the night quite nicely. \n\nIt was definitely a very expensive dinner (after tip was included), but we don't do these sort of dinners often and they gave us such a lovely experience. I think they have earned their spot as my new favorite steakhouse!! v^-^v", "author": "Christina L."}

We had called ahead and talked to a manager months beforehand and it was as if that conversation never happened. We had 11 people and we went on Nov.13 around 7:30pm. We got our drinks and everything was relaxed and under control. Everyone was laughing and sipping on our extremely overpriced drinks just unaware of the dumb***kery that was about to take place. We had a waiter that, at the time, seemed nice but I was wrong. We had a person in our party that was vegan which basically means that she eats veggies. Not a hard accommodation right?  Wrong. The waiter were so set on the preset menu which would have been fine except that this was part of the call head we had with the manager. The manager was like no problem. Then we get there, oh no jk. Seriously, wtf, we talked to a manger and we got everything back on track. We order our apps, entrees, blah blah blah. The drinks kept coming at a semi steady manner. Then our food comes out after a some what long wait. The appetizers come out, then the entrees blah blah blah. Everything was good. My friends brought a bottle of wine and bought a bottle of wine. The corking fee over that phone was allegedly $25. (on the bill it became $50, a nice shady bait and switch tactic) They sang a birthday song to the birthday boy. We were feeling good. Then the bill comes. The waiter just drops it off and it is all together. One of my friends laid her card down and realized it wasn't a separated check. She coherently told the waiter she wanted separate checks. He takes her card and runs it for the full $1600 bill. Then runs off. We saw his error and waited for the waiter. He never shows up again. We have to go looking for him. When we finally get him we get upset and tell him to split the bill up and void payment on the card that was charged $1600. He basically got the manager and had him deal with it. The manager brought the unseparated check back and told us to number each other off and mark off the items we had. LITERALLY *UCKING DOING THEIR JOB FOR THEM. Like why even bother tipping these people. The manager made a joke about how my friend was paying for everyone. All of us just gave him the look of death because he clearly doesn't know how to read a room. We finally finished paying out and the overall experience was just miserable. The food itself was pretty but mediocre. I have been to places with better tasting food, better quality, and frankly worth the money. The fish I got was over cooked and the other things I bought was forgettable. My friends that bought steaks never finished them which to me was a very bad sign.

For dinner, we shared the NY Wagyu beef. It melted in your mouth like butter and was cooked perfectly! We had the Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts to go with it.

In true fashionista form, I'd like to think we were the best dressed couple in the joint. Suit and cocktail dress a blaze, we felt right at home in this plush restaurant James Bond would be proud of.  That being said, in true SF form, if ya got the money, wear whatever the hell you want.  Though I think the guys in baseball caps and jeans looked visibly uncomfortable as their dates jabbered on.\n\nThe service was AMAZING. Our waitress was perfectly attentive and informative without being overbearing.  Due to a booking error, the manager asked us to move tables right before dessert.  He was very apologetic and offered to comp us 2 drinks and dessert.  Well since you asked so nicely....that will be 1 port, 1 madeira and a chocolate lava cake equivalent.  \n\nSorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.  Before the fantastic dessert we were given a bite to \"awaken your palette\".  Mine was a delectable creamy lobster soup.  Because of the man's allergies, they gave him a little container of shishito peppers. Mmmmm.\n\nNext we split the iceberg wedge with egg, bacon, fried shallots and Russian dressing. This was crisp fresh and generously sized  (even when split).\n\nOur main courses were modest given the $400 wagu tasting (4 or so different 4oz wagu cuts)  that was listed on the menu.  We got the skirt steak with house kimchee bean sprouts and the 12oz ribeye with green pepper corn sauce and shitake mushroom.  As a ribeye fan, I was really pleased with the marbling, flavor combination, and overall perfectly cooked steak.  The kimchee was an excellent touch on the also perfectly cooked skirt steak.   We split a truffeled mac n cheese that pretty much had me wanting to lick the cast iron bowl...\n\nOverall it was a beautiful dinner.", "author": "Susan C."}

The check was presented without me asking for it. \n\nThe trimmings and sides are good. However you go to a steakhouse for the steak and their steaks are never right.

For those bored, you can read my past reviews about San Francisco restaurants or I can sum it up here as over priced but good food and terrible service delivered by angry hipsters.  5A5 only meets one of those criteria so I'll give it a 5 star review and mostly that's because of the \"non hipster\" professional service.  Because frankly, there's a ton of places to get a great steak in this city.  \n\nI've probably been here 5 times or more and the last two times our server has been Ryan.  Even though my last visit was over a year ago, Ryan recognized us from our last trip in.  He even remembered what we ordered, where we sat and who we ate with.  Menus in SF have gotten pretty fancy in the past few years and by fancy I mean I don't know what half the ingredients are.  We put our faith in the service and Ryan told us all about the menu, made tons of recommendations and pretty much choose the entire meal for us.  From tons of past bad experiences all over the city with HORRIBLE service, it's a real pleasure to actually be waited on by a true professional.  Everything went perfectly and it was a fantastic meal and experience.  We are spoiled in SF because there are so many good food options.  However, most restaurants are over crowded, loud, tiny and worst of all with horrible service.  \n\nThe down side has to be the price.  I think they've raised their prices somewhat recently because dinner for 3 was $500 with taxes and tip.  In the past I think dinner was more in the $200 range so I was pretty shocked by the check.", "author": "Chris F."}

You don't need marinade or sauce with a perfectly grilled medium rare filet. \n\n5A5 was on my list to try as some friends raved about it and yelp reviews were solid 4 stars. \n\nThe waiter was super attentive and introduced us to their Australian Japanese wagyu selections. Fantastic marbling indeed. Just like the ones you find in Japan. Having tried Kobe beef and top notch wagyu in Japan, I personally am not a huge fan of fatty meat. But if you love marbled meat and never tried good wagyu, I think it's definitely worth a try, but be prepared to pay the price. \n\nOrdered hamachi appetizers served on a spoon: Okay. They also gave out some more complimentary spoon appetizers to cleanse your palate for the steak. Iceberg wedges came out next. Did not like the oily tempura crumbs they sprinkled over. Bad idea. The mashed potato was way too guey and almost like a soup so we had to return it and replace it with truffle Mac and Cheese. Yeah, that was okay.. But I'm not too fussed over starters or sides. Just serve me my steak please. \n\nThe steak came out a little late. Must have been a busy Friday night. \n\nWe ordered a filet mignon and a bone in rib eye. All American Angus, medium rare. Filet came out cooked to perfection but rib eye was a little too rare.. We had to ask for it to cook for a little more. Getting the grilling to your likings at restaurants are quite often hit a miss. Almost like a unpredictable bad hair day. Some do it better some don't and that makes a difference. \n\nOverall quality of the meat: was okay but not that great. I finished my filet but didn't have my omg moment. \n\nLoved their ambience and live piano playing in the background made it feel like a nice date night but I left with feeling somewhat... I don't know what to say other than I'm convinced as to why they'd have Costco gift card offers. (Think it was $75 for $100 deal)", "author": "Bomin K."}

In this case though I was glad the steaks came with these accoutrements because they weren't that great.  The menu doesn't indicate that the steaks were USDA Prime, which I usually take it to mean they are probably USDA Choice.  They certainly didn't taste like USDA Prime (not much flavor and a bit on the tough side).  \n\nThey do have a good selection of Japanese A5 Wagyu and even some F1 crossbred Wagyu.

I ordered the filet mignon cooked to medium rare plus and a lychee martini, while my boyfriend got the bacon wrapped scallops and the bone in ribeye.\n\nThe bacon wrapped scallops were pretty good, but my only qualm was that the scallops seemed a bit rubbery.

The lychee martini however was the highlight of my evening, it was very refreshing, sweet and light, and it didn't taste at all like it had alcohol in it though it did.

I definitely want to come back for dinner (the cousin says the prime ribs gives house of prime rib a big run for its money). \n\nAnyways, it's a $5 menu for some wonderful appetizers. We had the wings (very good and crunchy), they love the prime rib sammich, had hamachi bites, duck spring rolls (my least fave of what we ate, had no flavor without the dipping sauce), skewers and I can't remember what else. We had to eat and run, so was only in there for 20mins. \n\nAgain, service was great, food and presentation was great and atmosphere very sophisticated but not pretentious. The only odd thing to me about this place is the communal mixed sex bathroom. Where where's men's and woman's stalls all in the same room and we all share a communal sink, right in the middle.

Needless to say, the best part of the experience was the filet, which was expertly cooked, and the mashed potatoes, which had an excellent sweet bacon mixed in.\n\nThere were two things that kept it from being 5 stars:\n\n1.  The noise level in the restaurant was overpowering - my date and I literally had to yell like we were at a dive bar in order to hear each other.  Not the restaurants' fault necessarily, but it happened.\n\n2.  My date and I were looking for a couple of fruity drinks to share, and we requested as such from the waiter.  However, both of the waiters' recommendations were awful.  The first was a whiskey drink that was supposed to have a banana taste to it, and it did not - it was whiskey, which was not much to cry wolf about.  However, the second drink was abysmal - neither of us are fans of spicy, and the drink was described to us as having a note of habanero.  The FIRST SIP was absolutely not a NOTE of habanero, but rather a 5-alarm fire set off in our mouths that completely turned us off.  I couldn't take another sip of it and sent it back.\n\nOverall, if you manage the drink selection appropriate to your tastes, the food is excellent.  I wasn't thrilled about spending well over $200 (not being from SF and thus not used to the \"it's SF\" prices) on the meal because of the drinks, but it is certainly something I'll do again on future trips - the food is that good.", "author": "John D."}

My boyfriend took me here for our 2 year anniversary. The atmosphere was so fancy. The decor and look of the place was super modern. As soon as we walked on we were taken to our table that my boyfriend has reserved. Our host was a very friendly guy, who took a good amount of time in telling us about the rare meats that they served at this restaurant. He brought us little crackers filled with seafood that came on the house and I can't even begin to say how delicious this were.\n\nFor starters we ordered the Lobster tempura, which was huge. There were two pieces but they were most definitely jumbo. We also got the edamame in kimchi butter. Literally the best edamamae I have ever tasted in my life. It was warm and the little edamame just came out so easily and right into your mouth. \n\nFor the main course I got myself the Bone-in Ribeye, which came with Grilled corn\u200d pico de gallo, tomatillo sauce,  and chipotle demi. This combination was to die for. The meat just slipped off the bone. It was not only the juiciest thing ever but the flavor that the meat had was indescribable. My boyfriend got himself the Colorado Lamb Duo, which came with Onion puree, huckleberry sauce, torpedo onion, and grainy mustard. He was very impressed as well. We both shared our main courses and had no complaints whatsoever. His meat was also cooked to perfection and the sauce that it came had the most unique taste I have ever tried with any meat. \n\nI can't forget one of the sides that we ordered. This was the truffle mac and cheese. OMG.... That is all I can say. This was just something. I love mac and cheese, but this was just insane. The flavor was so strong that it took time to eat this mac and cheese. If your used to eating a bowl of mac and cheese just like that it is pretty impossible to do it with this one because of all that creaminess and flavor that its got to it. \n\nI had the most amazing 2 year anniversary any girl could ask for. I got to spend it with the person I love and at a restaurant that wowed all my expectations. The ending was just perfect to our dinner. We were served with a big plate that had Happy 2nd Anniversary written on it with a couple little puff pastry things.

There's a nice bar along with a lounge area. 5a5 Steak Lounge gives off the look of an upscale steak house with a lounge type of vibe. \n\nFood:\n\nMy girlfriend and I started out with the Ribs & Chips (honey - lavender glaze, red pearl onion, lotus chips.) The Ribs were pretty good. My girlfriend and l liked the flavor of the glaze and sauce. They weren't fall off the bone ribs. The texture of the ribs were a bit more chewy. My girlfriend and I prefer more tender and fall of the bone ribs. \n\nI ordered the bone-in ribeye (grilled corn pico de gallo, tomatillo sauce, chipotle demi.) The ribeye was pretty big (25 oz). The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The texture of the ribeye was spot on! It was very flavorful, juicy and so so tender! It had the perfect meat to fat ratio. I didn't really care for the grilled corn pico de gallo, tomatillo sauce and chipotle demi. It just didn't do it for me. I think the steak would have been better with a regular demi glace. Overall the steak was delicious even though I didn't like the sauce. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon (10 oz) (demi glace, tarragon beurre fondue, herb salad.) She thought the flavor of her filet was good but the steak was a little overcooked so the texture was not to her liking. She said her steak wasn't juicy, it was more on the dry side. \n\nWe also shared the mashed potato (smoked white cheddar, maple bacon) and truffled mac & cheese (gruyere, mozzarella, cheddar.) We absolutely loved both of these side dishes! The mashed potatoes tastes really good! The smoked white cheddar went perfectly with the maple bacon! You can never go wrong with bacon added to anything! They were definitely one of the best potato dishes we've ever eaten. The truffled mac & cheese is just as good if not better! It's the perfect mac & cheese. The flavors of the mac & cheese were very intense but not overpowering in any way. The mac & cheese was delectable. Anyone who eats here should definitely order both of these side dishes! \n\nService:\n\nOur waitress Leila was very nice. She checked up on us throughout our dinner. She always had a smile on her face. Our waters were always topped off. \n\nOverall:\n\n5a5 Steak Lounge is a really nice steak house. It's definitely a place for a date night, anniversary, birthday or to celebrate a special occasion. The food is very high end and high quality. The menu offers a variety of steaks and cuts. If you feel like splurging try one of their A5 Kobe Wagyu steaks. A5 is the highest grade of wagyu beef. The service at 5a5 is always great. 5a5 Steak Lounge is one of the best steak houses I've been to. I've been to literally every single steak house in the bay area and the only two steak houses that stand out to me are 5a5 Steak Lounge and Alexander's Steakhouse. If you haven't eaten at 5a5 Steak Lounge it's a definite must!", "author": "David R."}

It literally melted in my mouth. My fav was the rib eye! The portion was a good size, more than enough for 3 people to share. The sauces were amazing! Please try it so u know what m raving abt.\nThe service was pretty amazing, knowledgeable/confident. Manager was super nice and came to our table n made sure we were well taken care of.

The ambiance was very mellow right around 6-7 and the place was fairly crowded. The classical music added to the very romantic and calming atmosphere.\n\nThe food is just amazing! First with the beef teriyaki quinoa salad and then the bacon and sourdough bread. We both ordered the filet mignon and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten! Quality and taste substantially surpasses that of LB Steak. I love how it comes with various sauces already on the plate. In addition to the steak we got the mashed potatoes which had nice bacon chunks and a very pleasantly surprising sweet taste. The shroom medley was also very tasty. It had a sweet garlic sauce which I absolutely loved. They even surprised me at the end by presenting me with a strawberry shortcake in honor of my birthday. DELICIOUS! \n\nThe service was phenomenal and I wish more restaurants took after 5A5. Our server Al was very attentive and kind. He gave us the perfect amount of space while still checking on us periodically. Our water glasses never even reached half empty and that was just amazing how attentive every staff member is! \n\n100% recommend!

For my first experience, it was me and a bunch of girls celebrating a 30th bday for one of them and the entire experience was very memorable even after getting pretty tipsy with all the drinks, which by the way were refreshing with no strong alcohol taste but with a strong alcohol affect.  This night was surprisingly covered by a friend's friend, so we had the liberty to order whatever we wanted which allowed us to taste much more than we expected when first walking through the door. \n\nBefore I get to the food, let's talk about the restaurant itself - Very classy and trendy at the same time, with a separate bar area to start off with cocktails or wait for the rest of your party as I did. You can either order at the bar or sit and a be waited on for you libations, if you go either route and are eating in the main dining room they simply transfer the charges to your dinner bill upon request. In the bar area there is a piano which was played the entire time. The wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and very attentive. So attentive, we were waiting a while to get our waitress attention as she was explaining meats to the diners next to us, but that didn't detour us from enjoying the night. \n\n\nWe started off with apps \nShooters\nOyster: Chili - garlic salsa, plum & yuzu vinaigrette, julienne radish\nHamachi: Avocado, ginger, yuzu tobiko, scallion, micro wasabi, ponzu\nThey were great, fresh and flavorful . Presentation on point, being served on spoons\n\nU-10 scallops 2 ways: Shimichurri sauce, salsa cruda, oi sobagi, truffle trout roe\n1 way was seared and the 2nd way raw. This was good as well, however enjoyed the raw bite more\n\nWagyu beef sashimi: Shimeji, jicama, truffled daikon ponzu\nThis was good, maybe could have done without though \n\nBoneless ribeye steak: Shishito pesto, pickled mustard seeds, miso mustard, demi glace\nSo melt in the mouth, with great marbling of the fat. Best ribeye I think I have ever had\n\nFilet mignon: Demi glace, tarragon beurre fondue, herb salad \nUnfortunately didn't try, was too busy with the ribeye\n\nSides\nShrooms: maitake, Golden enokitake, eryngii, honshimeji, sherry wine, garlic\nThis was really good, very earthy flavors not masked by the seasoning\nMashed potato: Smoked white cheddar, maple bacon\nSo creamy and the touch of sweetness from the maple bacon made it that much better\nTruffled mac & cheese: Gruyere, mozzarella, cheddar\nThis was good too, will def add the lobster next time", "author": "Candice B."}

Took my girlfriend here for our two year anniversary over memorial weekend on a pretty slow night. Cool decor and layout but that's about the highlight of the night. Our server was pretty personable also.  We ordered a bottle of seltzer water and they asked if they wanted it left on ice which we said yes. We didn't see that bottle of seltzer water again till the end. They actually filled our half filled seltzer waters with regular water.  I also should have checked before I drank out of my glass but it had some gunky lipstick left from a previous customer. I know I should always check but if you're a restaurant that is selling itself as a high end place, the cup should be checked before it gets to our table.  This kinda ruined my experience. \nWe ordered the hamachi shooters which were good and also the truffle French fries which were good also. My girlfriend ordered the filet mignon which was cooked a perfect medium rare and I ordered the 32oz dry aged rib eye medium rare. Unfortunately my rib eye came out more medium well which made it tough to eat. I didn't want to send it back because we had a movie to get to and didn't have time to wait. I figure if you're gonna order steak here, get something smaller so that they can make it to your order. Think the 32 oz was too large and the chef maybe a little inexperienced with cooking large steaks.  Btw, they really do overpower their steak with the sauces. Sadly the sauces did make the overcooked steak easier to go down. I did inform the server it was over cooked and said I'll just take it home to make a sandwich out of it. We also ordered the truffle Mac and cheese which was drowned in oil and overpowered by the truffle oil. The mushrooms were great and the gnocchi was good too. I'd definitely look elsewhere if you're looking for steaks. I think I've had better experience and tastier food at an Outback Steakhouse.  Thank god we had a gift card cause if I paid the full price I would've been a bit more irritated.  Look elsewhere.  \n\nOh btw, to the owner of the restaurant, if you're going to have the servers wipe down our tables between dishes, please use something other than that moist rag. It's disgusting to see you wipe our table, still have condensation from the rag on our table, and then put our utensils directly on the table.", "author": "S Y."}

There were 5 of us, and we ordered the tartare, truffle fries, and wagyu rib cap 4 oz for appetizers. I must say, even though the wagyu is a huge splurge (it's around $32 an oz) it was worth every dollar. The meat is almost buttery and melts in your mouth. I'm glad I split it with 4 other people though because it's so rich. The truffle fries are addictive, you have to get them. The actual main dishes aren't super good after having the wagyu, but still enjoyable. I had the filet mignon, with the truffle mac and cheese and mushroom sides.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-13", "description": "I have had this book marked for some time. I had been building it up like the anticipation in a Hitchcock Classic. I have had chances to go here but wanted it to be special. I wanted it to be memorable. The moment finally came. I was able to go here with great friends, yelpers, and an Elite brethren who is a super yelper and was able to crank out his review while I was babbling over my wine glass. How'd he do that?\n\nSo let me begin... (Imagine strumming violin music while you read. I'm reaching for drama here). We came as a large party and were slated to have a private room with a pre fixe menu. The place is on the outskirts of the FIDI and parking here can be problematic. You will need to do valet, which they have but be prepared as these guys charge up front. It's a small thing but rather off putting considering this is a pretty high caliber steak house. (Customary to pay at pick up)\n\nUpon entering, our party was already at the lounge area and me and the lady were the last ones in. After salutations and greetings we were led to the elevator to a floor below. When the elevator doors opened there was a stench reminiscent of club/rave bathrooms. We walked into a room with a huge table and sat down wondering if we were where we were supposed to be. A couple minutes later, the ma\u00eetre d came down, apologized, and asked us to follow him back up to the right room. The room was simple. It was small but big enough for our party. \n\nOur pre fixe menu was set as placemats for us. On paper, it's an awesome menu. I couldn't wait to start grubbing. Our server, also named Ryan was very courteous, attentive, and knowledgable about their menu. The ma\u00eetre d came back in and asked us for our beverage orders and gave us recommendations for wine and cocktails. Right after this Ryan offered an explanation of the menu so we would know what to expect. He then started taking our orders. After taking our orders he came back with some grubbin' bacon bread, while we waited for our courses.\n\nThe first course was a taste course consisting of two spoons. These were delicious and just enough to wake up the palate. For the second course I opted for the oyster and leek soup because I was intrigued. This turned out to be my favorite item on the menu. It was subtle, delicate, but yet gave me just enough oyster and leek to know what i was eating. My wife had the scallops and these were good but not anything to crave. Still they were cooked perfectly with a good pan char. \n\nThe main course gave us a choice of sea bass, bone-in rib-eye and a filet mignon. I went for the rib eye because I was hungry . My steak was prepared perfectly medium. But it was drenched with a sauce that just took away from the flavor of the meat. It also came with haricovert beans and potatoes as well as stuffed peppers. The steak failed for me. It wasn't seasoned on its own and the sauce just drowned out its natural flavors. \n\nThe last course was a chocolate ganache cake with raspberry sorbet. That was delicious, I should have started with dessert. \n\nSo here is my rating:\n\nFood: (being this is a steakhouse they should know to always make their steaks awesome and balanced. Yet they gave me a tasteless steak. The starters ( spoon course and soup) were delicious. I would go back for these. The dessert was ridiculously good. But overall rating here is a 3.5. It's a 3.5 because you pay literally an arm and a leg to eat here. When you pay this much you expect a lot. I feel I have the right to expect a lot.\n\nService: this was excellent. No complaints here. Ratings go up here tremendously.\n\nPrice: way to pricy for what we got in terms of taste. The steak was a great cut and not an outback steak. But flavorless due to the sauce.\n\nAmbiance: nice feel to this place. It's modern chic, classy. Bathrooms need work and the stench needs to be fixed immediately.\n\nWould I come back: yes I would and will order from the regular menu to give the place a fair shake. In the end I would give it a 3.5 based on this experience. I do feel this place should be at least a 4-5. Sadly, on this night my intentional build up was nothing close to a money shot and I do like money shots!", "author": "Ryan C."}

Honestly, we were like in love with each other all over again and we hadn't even gotten to our mains yet. \n\nWe made the mistake of getting two sides with our steaks when just one would have sufficed. I had high hopes for the brussel sprouts, but I think my dude makes them better :(   On the plus side, the potatoes and our steaks were good. We were pretty much not talking to each other at that point. Just blissfully chewing - except for the part where he was like, \"Can you believe how big my meat is?\"... and he was referring to the steak on his plate. It was pretty massive. \n\nHow we managed to leave room for dessert was beyond me but we did, somehow, which was convenient because it was my lumberjack's birthday. He was surprised to see his name written in chocolate and grinned for a bit like a little schoolboy. It was precious. Desserts are a win.\n\nOne thing that I didn't really dig was the meager selection of wines by the glass. While we are totally capable of polishing off a bottle of something between us, we do appreciate being able to change wines during a nice multi-course meal.

I'm fond of dining in booths. I'm distracted easily and booths allow me to focus solely on my dining companions and converse with them more. I still occasionally sneak a peak over my shoulder to see what other tables are ordering though :) My steak was average in my opinion. Cooked well but not as memorable as i hoped. If anything, i remember their mac n cheese much more vividly!! Decent meal overall.", "author": "Samantha L."}

The server was friendly and helpful with recommendations of the new items on their menu. The crab salad was not really as good as I've expected, it was too heavy in cream and I was expecting something more refreshing as a salad, but I've insisted to give it a try since it was one of the new dishes on the menu. We also ordered 2 bone in rib eye steak, however both of the steak tastes different, so it's not very consistent with their flavors.

I was excited to try out 5a5 , as we have been hitting up some of the other well known steakhouses in SF, Alexanders, Boboquivaris... He called in to make reservations, and requested to be seated away from the kitchen and hallways (my pet peeve). We were promptly escorted to a table, RIGHT next to the kitchen. We then requested to be moved to the other side of the dining dome.\n\nOur server quickly came over to show us the various types of Waygu served, recommended the lobster tempura and gave us our menus. We decided on the Hamachi bites, lobster tempura, truffle fries, truffle mac and cheese, \nTajima F1 Filet (cross breed )for me since waygu is too rich and fatty for me, and the dry aged T-bone for him. We also ordered a bottle of the Bedrock Pinot.\n\nThe Hamachi bites came out quickly. I was excited to take this bite, but as the flavors settled in my mouth, I was jarred by the ginger, and disappointment set in. This knock off hamachi bite was an insult to the wonderful creation from Alexander's Steakhouse. \n\nNext , came the lobster tempura. Lovely presentation ! After a few pics, we eagerly split the lobster tail and dipped into the sauce. WOAH. (insert Lemon sour face reaction ) VINEGAR. VINEGAR. VINEGAR. It was not sweet or sour, shiitake flavor, It was just vinegary! After choking down my bite, I ate the rest of the tail plain.\n\nTruffle fries are my favorite dish to order everywhere they are served, From local burger joints, to higher end dining, I want to try them all. However, 5a5 was able to mangle this simple dish. As the meal started to unfold this was becoming expected.. We were served bottom of the barrel french fry bits, charred and over fried. They carried the crisp of a lay's potato chip , and we were greeted with an oily burst as each bite crumbled in our mouths. The sauce which was described as Siracha aoli , but it carried NO taste or hint of siracha. The fries, no taste of truffle. Needless to say, we had to send this back, and no, please do not bring out another one, but yes tell the \"chef\" because he needs to know.\n\nThe entrees arrive and I begin cutting into my F1 filet. I had to look down because I thought maybe my knife was upside down because I could not cut through my meat! An order of waygu crossbreed should be tender, easy to slice when cooked at medium rare, but again, 5a5 would prove me wrong. My plate was scorching hot, no warning from the server, indication that my meat had been sitting under the hot lights waiting for my BF's T-bone to finish. The flavors? They were nice, but the meat was tough and rubbery, I've had steaks at Denny's more chewable than this. $88 fior this? :(\n\nI try to wash down the steak with a bite of truffle mac and cheese, and I knew now, the kitchen must have it out for us after the truffle fry incident. Now this was ALL truffle oil, HEAVY on the unsalted butter and no salt. Is this come kind of joke?\n\nTo use the restroom, I walked around the dome to the staircase, walked slowly down the stairs in my 5 inch heels, walked past a rowdy private party and found myself in the communal restroom. I walk into the first door on the right and found, no toilet seat covers, toilet seat up, a present in the toilet bowl , and the nozzle of the soap broken off and laying on the sink. *sigh* \n\nIs this supposed to be a high end restaurant? We never had our wine glasses filled for us, our server never came to check on how we were doing . My water went empty once. Only the manager came to apologize for the food, and the restroom. The server at the table next to us was rolling her eyes waiting for the table to make their final selections. This restaurant is not classy, This restaurant was not romantic, They are overpriced for the quality of food and ambiance. If we spend $300 on a meal, we go for the ambiance and quality food. \n\nFusion Dishes. Why are you serving this when you don't know how? I see that there was a Chinese Executive Chef according to the menu but he was NOWHERE to be seen in your kitchen which we still had an open view of? Are you even checking to see if the dishes that leave YOUR kitchen are edible!? \n\nI give credit to ONE person at that restaurant who tried to offer some compensation for our experience and terrible food. The manager of the night is who I gave 5 stars to, giving this restaurant a 2 star review. She was busy running around apologizing to the table next to me as well as putting out other fires I'm sure.\n\nHad I come here for happy hour for some bites, and drinks, perhaps it would have been acceptable, but for a place we chose especially for my birthday dinner, This was the most disappointed I have ever been.

After enjoying one of my favorite Yelp events, I came back for the Dine About San Francisco deal several years ago, but forgot to Yelp about it.  With some friends visiting from SoCal and staying in Nob Hill, this was my choice of restaurants for a leisure Sunday night dinner.  The restaurant was packed as it was the first Sunday of the Dine About Town promotion, giving it a lively atmosphere.  I followed the Dine About menu and ordered additional appetizers and sides for my friends to try.  The meal was so good that I came here with a group of local friends the following Saturday.  Here's what I/we had:\n\nAppetizers:\n1) Hamachi shooters - Nice  nonalcoholic way to toast the beginning of a good meal.  A perfect mix of hamachi cubes, ginger, avocado, and tobiko in a ponzu sauce.\n\n2) Daikon Soup with crab meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=CL-XoG9ZG4_RlfKeHsg9tw) - A surprisingly rich tasting soup with a hearty spoonful of crab meat; no, not the imitation variety.\n\n3) Duo of Tataki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=I7BgutadCLvrI6AbffQC7g) - Think of two parallel worlds, made up of two different types of raw fish (ahi tuna and escolar), seasoned with contrasting flavored sauces.\n\nAmuse Bouche\n4) Chwan Mushi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=m123O0rjDDeHm42G3Ib4Eg) - A small ceramic bowl filled with a light egg custard and seasoned with some crab meat and shiitake mushroom.\n\nEntree\n5) Rib Eye Steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=4eaSRMK-qPV1WHHhYS6WWg) - Cooked perfectly medium rare, this was a hearty meal (12 oz. boneless..  It was flavorful and seasoned with a brandy peppercorn sauce, shiitake mushroom slices, and olive oil.\n\nSide Dishes\n6) Swiss chard (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=569nOE_gnQ-RvE6KClWBAA) -  A lighter side with bold flavors and cooked to a crispy and crunchy texture along with red onions, garlic, white wine, and lemon.  My favorite side dish.\n\n7) Shrooms (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=jPzskAtUj-J64FjDnuCbAg) - A generous portion of assorted Asian and wild mushrooms.  Pretty good, but liked Alexander's version a little more.  Not enough \"wow\" factor.\n\n8) Creamed Spinach - My personal bar for this is the HOPR (House of Prime Rib) version which is a bit more runny.  Flavor is comparable.\n\n9) Truffled Mac 'N Cheese - Think rich (three different cheeses) and filling as the Mac 'N Cheese was generously seasoned with truffle oil.\n\nDessert\n10) Pistachio Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=uXtbPGR-0kGd-KhCx0UFuA) -  Shaped like a small muffin and served warm, this was a nice ending to a delicious meal.\n\nBetween courses, the kitchen also presented an icy refresher to cleanse the palate.  Remembering the old days of Frisson, 5A5 did not nice job of rejuvenating this location.  Make sure to check out their interesting restroom arrangement which often leaves the diner with a question mark on his or her face.  Hope to be able to try their Wagyu steak on a future trip, but I better get a big tax refund before that'll happen.", "author": "Mike C."}

I've heard great things and it was a debate between 5A5 and Bobo's.\nWell, I think I should have checked out Bobo's. Don't get me wrong, the service is SO GREAT. They pay attention to your special occasion and make you feel spoiled.\nThe serving sizes are typical for a 5-7 course meal. We ordered a filet mignon from the menu and of course, had to get a ribeye after being told how the cow is cared for etc.\nI felt that my filet tasted better than the ribeye. It didn't taste any different than other steakhouses I've been. which was so disappointing. We had the chicken skewers as apps and they were actually so much more flavorful than the steak.

Very modern d\u00e9cor.  Pretty loud in the dining area because of the bar right next door during happy hour.  \n\nService was fabulous.  Complementary appetizer and palate cleansing bites between courses a classy treat.  Shrimp and the beef slider appetizers were OK.  Not a fan of shrimp with shell and the sliders were good, but tiny.  The roast beef entr\u00e9e was excellent, not necessarily worth the price, but a good deal considering the wagyu steaks started at $140 and skyrocketed upwards after that.  I enjoyed the mac and cheese with truffle sauce, but the brussel sprouts were a disappointment.  \n\nPretty darned expensive place.  So why is everyone so casually dressed?  Spend hundreds of dollars on dinner and wear torn jeans and sneakers?\n\nThe highlight of this place must be the Japanese wagyu steaks.  The marbling makes it tender and delicious.  Unfortunately, marbling means ribbons of fat, so don't bother spending hundreds of dollars on your steaks and then trim off the fat.  No such thing as excess fat.  Fat is what makes it special when it's all over your steak.  Better save up your pennies.", "author": "Doctor G."}

The creative dishes and the knowledgeable servers and flawless service was just the perfect experience for my birthday and anniversary with my honey. \n\nThe introduction from the server started with a board with four different wagyu raw steaks. He described them and explained each cut. He also explained that A-5 is the best rating for a wagyu steak. Each price for the steak is by the oz. which was pretty pricey for me. \n\nOn to the meal:\nWe started with sourdough and bacon bread. Already a great start. The bacon bread was delicious.\n\nThe server brought out Escobar Ceviche. Yum. This was a nice delightwr. \n\nWe ordered the Lobster Tempura with the shiitake mushroom sweet and sour sauce. This is a definite must try for the experience. The Lobster Tempura tastes great without the sauce and amazing with the sauce. \n\nNext we ordered the Wagyu Beef sliders with the pickled red onions and Swiss/cheddar cheese. We had on with Swiss cheese. One with cheddar cheese. When this comes out, let it sit for a bit while you eat the sweet potato fries that come with it. The sweet potato fries weren't anything special but while you let the sliders sit, the bottom will collect all the juices for the steak. Each bite of the slider was just fabulous. I liked this better than the Lobster Tempura and that was already hard to beat. \n\nJust before the entrees, the server brought out a small pallet cleanser: strawberry jelly with coconut foam and hazelnut powder.\n\nWe were already stuffed before we got to the entrees.\n\nI ordered the Bone In Rib Eye steak. Make sure to order a tempurature less than you want. This rib eye was huge. I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium. Delicious with corn Pico de Gallo and tomatillo.\n\nMy honey ordered the Bone In New York steak. He ordered this medium rare and it came out perfectly. It was so good and sweet. \n\nLastly we looked over the dessert menu. We couldn't fit anything else so we opted out of dessert. It was a surprise when they brought out a place with a candle for my birthday and anniversary both written on the plate with chocolate. In the middle was an almond cake with whip cream and strawberries. Yum. Just the perfect ending to this dining experience. \n\nSo I say... Yes go to this place and just be wowed with the service, food, ambience, and experience", "author": "Chelsey O."}

It's kind of making my mouth water thinking about them right now. I could take down as many shooters and peppers as they'll give me. As for the mains, if you are lucky enough to get there early when they still have the prime rib, get it!!  They run out at about 8pm.  The filet mignon and bone in ribeye are also really nice.  Now, if you want the best, go for the A5 japanese wagyu that will just melt in your mouth - you can also split one among the table.  If you're wondering about the crossbred wagyu, I actually do like it, and do prefer it over the regular cuts for a fraction more and still significantly less than the true A5 wagyu.  \n\nTo end the night, I rarely have room for dessert, but I do make room for their whiskey cart.

Tasty, definitely could have had more of these.\n**Rib Eye Steak:Ordered medium rare, and it came out more medium.  It was good and tasty, just like a rib eye should be.

I went with a 4 because I think other people would like this place more than me, but honestly, I may not come back.  It really is a 3.6 rounded up in my book.\n\nService: 3 - I expect high end steakhouses to have top-notch service.  In this case, there are a lot of waitstaff, but service was either spotty or amazing.  When I first sat down, I sat in my chair empty handed (no menu or drink) while a dozen people stood around the restaurant twiddling their thumbs.  At other times, those people were amazingly efficient, whisking away plates or refilling drinks within seconds.  However, when my steak was undercooked (more on that below), no one came to check on how my food was and my primary waiter ran by my table multiple times while I had my hand in the air trying to wave him down.\n\nAmbience: 5 - This could be a love or hate for some people.  If you want the typical old school, wooden steakhouse feel, this is not it.  I think there are enough steakhouses like that, so I like the more hip, modern feel of this place.\n\nFood: 3.5\n- Truffle Mac & Cheese: 4\n- Hamachi app - 5\n- Tuna app - 5\n- \"compliments of the Chef\" in between courses - taste 3 or 4, but it's free, so I give it a 5\n- Steak (heaviest weighting by far) - 3:  I like steaks medium (nice juicy pink throughout w/o being chewy).  I know most people like medium rare.  Also, my favorite cut is a well-marbled ribeye, usually without any toppings/sauce.  First of all, this restaurant puts toppings/sauce on every steak.  I was able to ask for it on the side (against the waiter's recommendation), and i'm glad I did.  The sauce/toppings just overwhelm the flavor of the steak.  I asked for a medium ribeye, and the waiter said that they couldn't reliably do that.  He claimed the ribeye was 2\" and too thick to cook to medium.  He said it was the steak most often sent back for being cooked improperly.  I've had plenty of great medium, thick steaks, but not wanting to take a chance, I got a NY strip.  It was seasoned perfectly, and was a thin cut.  The very edges were perfect but the majority of the steak was medium rare.  This is something ANY steakhouse should have been able to get right with such a thin piece of meat.  After a waiter acknowledged it was medium rare, they took it back to recook it.  When they brought it back, they simply burned more of the edges, making the sear a thicker coating of well done, and the middle was exactly the same.  I've had other top restaurants (in the very rare case that it's undercooked) be able to correct it by cooking it evenly.\n\nSo, lots of good things about this place, but they aren't consistent about the 2 most important things for a high-end steakhouse: 1) steak and 2) service.", "author": "Buddha B."}

Immediately I liked that they did not have a snooty attitude as some higher end restaurants do. \n\nWe had 2 cocktails each that were fairly tasty for the $5 price tag (note: its only the well drink and a juice mixer for this special!) and we shared the shishito peppers, truffle fries and had oyster and hamachi shooters. Everything was super tasty and the environment was enjoyable and cozy. \n\nWe were seated promptly for our reservation and our server was helpful in explaining the waygu beef and recommendations (though its a bit out of our price range now, it'd be fun to do the waygu experience one day!). I had the 10 oz filet mignon, medium and we all shared sides of the mushrooms, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. I thought my filet mignon was a tad tough, but probably my bad for getting it medium and not medium rare. I did enjoy the bits of candied bacon on it.  I had a bite of my bf's bone-in ribeye that was tasty and well cooked.  My favorite side was the mushroom medley that had a delicate but savoury taste. \n\nFor myself, the bill including HH and tax/ tip came out to about $90, so it's probably not something I'd do again in a hurry.

Add your apps, a la carte accompaniments and drinks and while I vacay with that grand .... You enjoy that grand experience! \n\nIf money is no object, come here and drop it because your palate will be praising the chefs. \n\nI'm sure the chef wouldn't love this recommendation but you can do any mix of their sauce toppings on any cut of the American meats.  You're paying for it, so take chef recommendation or have it your way.\n\nHave had the filet mignon before and it's perfect but I wanted to try the boneless ribeye with bacon jam and an egg.  Wow. And under $40, amazing.\n\nFinally we ordered what didn't seem like too much food for the 2 of us but quality food is very rich and you don't need to eat tons. Though truth be told, we wouldn't have omitted anything.  If anything, would have added a veggie because I think the creamed spinach was yelling my name from the menu -  if only the Mr would eat his greens and share.\n\nWe didn't save room for dessert but they did bring a complimentary \"happy anniversary\" written chocolate sauce with a couple bites of chocolate cake, strawberries and a rich whipped cream. Very classy touch.\n\nExcellence in service, presentation, quality, decor  and missing absolutely nothing.  No way anyone can say this place is \"decent\" or give it low stars -lest they be crazy! \nFull stars and may they be blinking stars for emphasis!!  \n\nIf you read my hundreds of yelp reviews over the years, I do not state that so freely.", "author": "Athena S."}

The citric flavor could be too bold for some but refreshing for others.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was from the prime rib. First, it was served lukewarm. Probably sat in the kitchen a little too long while the other steak was being prepared. The doneness was correct.

I was very excited about this place, I had chosen it over many others to celebrate my boyfriends 30th birthday and on top of that the itinerary I had created was a surprise. \nWe arrived early and were seated in a less than desirable area of the restaurant. My boyfriend mentioned to the hostess that we would prefer to sit in a more central location to be able to enjoy the full ambiance of the restaurant (after all it was his 30th birthday and it should be a unique and special experience). This was the first fault of many that we endured while trying to dine here.. Which is very disappointing since I booked through open table and I usually have a great experience when I do at other restaurants. Then we ordered our drinks, which came after waiting a short while. For appetizers we ordered the kale salad and the truffle fries, for main entrees we ordered the salmon and Wagyu ribeye plus a side of asparagus. This is where things went awry, we waited and waited and waited... Nothing... People around us got their food and we only had bread.. Finally we spoke to the manager who offered to comp our drinks but we declined, I wasn't going to wait any longer and pay that type of bill for such a terrible experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone, not even people I dislike.. I feel that this may have been a fluke but is it really worth risking your special event and feeling the way I felt when I left? I highly doubt it.. Just a warning.", "author": "Samantha D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-27", "description": "Meh.\n\nI've been to a lot (a LOT) of steakhouses, and when you're charging $49 a la cart for a filet and $64 for a bone-in ribeye and your cheapest glass of red wine is $15, its got to be worth it. Honestly, I don't mind spending a lot of money on really good food, and usually when a meal is $370 (includes 20% tip) for 3 people, I expect it to be talked about after you leave the restaurant and brought up again in future conversations dreaming about having the food again. Didn't happen. The food was good, but not $370 good. And we didn't even order a ton. We had the shishito peppers (most memorable thing I ate, honestly - $9), then 2 barrata salads ($14/ea - just tomatoes, oil, and burrata, nothing else) and a wedge ($12); 2 filets ($49/e) and the bone in ribeye ($64) - my filet was average, slightly undercooked but didn't want to run the risk of it being overcooked by sending it back, the ribeye was prob the best steak but who needs 32oz; ordered mac and cheese (good) and mashed potatoes (super runny but good) - both $13; we didn't have dessert, I had 2 glasses of average $15 zinfandel and then my bf ordered a whiskey sprite and my dad had 2 diet cokes. Oh, and the table sitting behind us were from out of town and got a $20 gift card for some reason at the end of their meal and gave it to us and we used it, so the meal was actually $390. \n\nMeh.\n\nThe food was eclipsed by several things (although not entirely difficult to do):\n \n1. The lighting - it was SO bright in there, like we took a picture and my bfs face is half out of focus from the orb of radiating light coming from the lamp right near our table. The FIRST step to achieving a great ambiance is the appropriate lighting level... nobody wants to be on a dinner date with 8000 watts on them.\n\n2. The volume - it was SO loud on top of being SO bright. My dad is a little hard of hearing and he was having trouble hearing me and my bf and later my bf commented that he felt like he was shouting the whole time at dinner, and we are not necessarily quiet people to begin with. \n\n3. The seating - the circular booth set up is great in theory but you're at odd angles with the tables around you to the point where it sort of feels like you're all sitting at the same table. Part of my night was a little uncomfortable bc the dude at the next table was staring at me and bc of the way the tables were arranged, any time I looked straight ahead I had to make awkward eye contact with this guy. \n\n4. The bathrooms - mens and womens stalls next to each other with a communal trough sink, ew. This isn't a shitty club, get two bathrooms. When we were leaving we all went to the bathroom (before knowing the bathroom situation) and there is nothing more awk than walking into a bathroom stall in between your dad and your bf (well I'm sure there are many things more awk, but I mean) and how am I supposed to adequately make sure that I look okay and don't have shit in my teeth when I have to share the bathroom with dudes. Oh you also have to take an elevator to get to the bathroom. Passssss. \n\n5. The valet - I valeted my car, and was early (for ONCE) and when my bf showed up he said that my lights were on on my car, and I was like \"I valeted, I'm sure they haven't parked it yet\" and he said that it was parked and I was like well I am sure that they will notice since they are valeting other cars (assuming that when you pay to valet that they have some sort of lot and it would be obvious after a couple minutes that my car's lights were on). Well not until we were waiting an extremely long time for the car to come back did my bf clarify that when he saw my car with the lights on it was parked at the meters on the street around the corner. So then it became obvious that nobody had noticed the lights being left on and the valet attendant was probably over there trying fruitlessly to start my car. (Also, if you pay for valet, and then you just go park the car on the street, I think there should be some sort of disclaimer that says \"we're not actually watching your car,\" bc clearly they weren't - and sometimes I leave things in my car when I valet assuming that it won't be left on the street for people to break into.)\n\nBack to the point - the attendant comes back and says my car won't start and then I informed him that my bf saw that the lights had been left on and that was why the car didn't start and then he told me that he noticed that the lights were on and turned them off--which was a complete lie, bc the lights were on when I went back to the car--and that he was sorry. So my bf said he had jumper cables in his car and we walked to my car and proceeded to hook up the jumper cables and get my car started. Not sure what would have happened if he wouldn't have drove bc the valet didn't have jumper cables. But it probably should if it's going to leave people's lights on and kill their batteries. \n\nAll in all, was a good night because I had great company.\n\nI'll pass on coming back here.", "author": "Nikki D."}

Water was served and we ordered 4 appetizers. We were served a little cheese spinach stick as a compliment from the chef prior to our dinner and it was adorable and pretty good. \nOysters: So delicious! It was so fresh, a little bit of a sour aftertaste but I couldn't stop eating them!\nHamachi: My favorite appetizer by far! The fish was sooooo fresh and the sauce complimented it so well. I can't even describe how good it was. I definitely recommend you get this one!\nLobster tempura: I am not a fan of fried food but this was still pretty good. The flavor of the lobster was kept well even though it was fried. Only complaint is that the tail shell was hard to separate from the fleshy parts.\nFoie Gras: It was my first time having this so I don't really have anything to compare it to! The plating was very nice and minimalistic. I simply do not have a taste for liver, so it didn't really speak to me.\nWe got a little palette cleanser which was a blueberry jam kind of thing with lemon foam before our entree and I really enjoyed it.\nWe ordered two different entrees. We both wanted steaks, I wanted the dry aged tbone and my family member got another steak but I can't remember the name. I wanted mine medium rare and she wanted hers well done but we were informed it would take an hour and she was starving! We ended up switching the cooking times so hers would be medium rare and mine well done.\nThe portions were HUGE. The steaks came out and we were so surprised. We could not even finish them. But the parts we did eat were so delicious! I would definitely recommend mine as it came with a sous vide egg on it which was really cool.\nOverall, love this place! It's a little bit pricey but definitely worth it!", "author": "Alexi G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-20", "description": "Came here last night for my birthday dinner with le boyfriend (: velly velly good!\n\nThe decor of the restaurant was very modern with dim lighting. There was also a pianist playing some wonderful music! One thing that I disliked, however, was that my seat sunk lower than I expected so the table was a little bit too high for my body. (I hope it's not because I gained weight or anything lol) \n\nJust a heads up, I realized that the price of the wagyu changes every now and then most likely because of the market price, so mine might be slightly different from yours. Also, the Prime Rib has limited availability, so think of a back up plan just in case! The waiter/waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable. They will definitely give you some recommendations so no worries! \n\n-Boneless Ribeye Steak ($33): \"shishito pesto, pickled ginger, miso mustard, demi glace 12 oz\". The one awesome thing that I have to point out is that 5A5 cooks the beef very precisely, just like how you want it. I asked for rare, and my steak came out perfectly rare. The demi glace sauce with the ribeye was perfect in my opinion. The shishito pesto was also pretty nice to have, but I didn't really care for the pickled ginger. Ribeyes are ribeyes, so there were a lot of connective tissue which were impossible to chew. Other than that, this was a pretty decent steak. \n\n-100% Japanese Miyazaki A5 Wagyu NY ($32/oz):\"truffle cheese, truffle bubbles, demi glace\". My boyfriend got the 4oz, which came out to be around $128. I would recommend the 4oz instead of the 8oz because I personally think that ordering their side dishes are well worth it :P My first bite of this was so so so good. SO GOOD. I must say that I should've finished my ribeye before eating this because it made my steak less delicious. The wagyu was extremely mouthwatering!\n\n-Truffled Mac & Cheese ($12): \"gruyere, mozzarella cheddar\". OH MY GOD. THIS IS A MUST GET. 5STARS. 5STARS ALL THE WAY. I was expecting mac n cheese with just a hint of truffle, but I was so wrong. THIS IS TRUFFLE EXPLOSION IN YOUR MOUTH. It was extremely delicious. My boyfriend and I literally said \"oh my god\" when we took our first bite. I am going to order this every time I come here now. ONE FOR ME. ONE FOR EVERYONE ELSE.\n\n-Potato au Gratin ($11): \"japanese sweet potato, peruvian purple potato, idaho yukon gold\". This is another amazing side! Not too rich and creamy, which I really liked. The taste was mild and soft, unlike the truffled mac n cheese so it won't overpower your steak. The use of 3 different kinds of potatoes was brilliant. A very nice mixture! \n\n-Creamed Spinach: I don't know because this side dish never arrived. It surprisingly got counted in our total when we got our check, but our waitress took it off right away. She was very nice and cool about it.\n\n-Creme Brulee: ($12): My dessert came free because it was my birthday (: The pianist also played Happy Birthday on the piano when this dessert came out. So nice of them! This is a very nice dessert, very smooth and delicious! There are fruits and dried plums (I think), so the sweetness balances out perfectly if you eat it with them. \n\n-Purple Moon Cheese (1 for 7): Came with 2 slices cheese, some crackers, and some fruits. It has a nice red wine aroma to it, I must say. Not my favorite cheese, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it!\n\nWhich jumps in to the service. 5 Stars for the waitress that I got. Very friendly, always smiling. Never rude. She made sure that my boyfriend and I were enjoying our food without being annoying. She also gave us really good recommendations!", "author": "Jackie T."}

I finally got to dine here so it's about time I wrote a review. \n\nAs far as restaurants go 5A5 is beautifully laid out.  The circular main dining room is stunning. The lounge is nice but looks really worn down in certain areas. Couches have holes and leather is worn away in noticeable spots. If you'e trying to impress visually stick with the dining room.\n\nOur server was on point but he wasn't the most charming. Mind you this is my personal preference but I'd rather have my server screw up once but have them charming as hell rather than precise and on point with no personality. That's just me.  He was good but in all honesty bland. My friend and I ordered the prime rib and the 30oz bone in rib eye.  We also had a couple glasses of wine as well. Prices seemed fair enough for a SF steakhouse but as far as quality goes it wasn't up to either of our standards. \n\nSince we shared both plates I'll just say this.  If you want steak I'd tell you to go to Alexander's or Harris. If you want prime rib then go to House of Prime rib. Neither of the plates wowed us. In fact we were slightly disappointed. The meat was cooked well visually but the flavor lacked a lot and the texture of both dishes was tougher than we expected. Though I did like the crust on the prime rib the \"meat\" of the dish couldn't keep my attention. The rib eye crust lacked salt and tasted closer to Korean ribs. Which in our minds we could have gotten better elsewhere for far less. We also shared some mashed potatoes and the mushrooms.  The potatoes were pretty plain even with the bacon cubes. The mushrooms however were probably the best thing we ate that night. \n\nIn the end we probably won't dine here again as there is simply better elsewhere. I still do like the lounge specifically the bar. It's especially a great spot to grab a drink if you're waiting to go to Kokkari next door. I might note that they do meat very well there even though it's not a steakhouse. At least better than their neighbors in my opinion.", "author": "Joco F."}

We called a few days ahead to make reservations at 830.  The night of our reservations we called at 7pm to let them know we were running late and if 930 would be ok. They were happy to push back our reservation for 5 guest back. We of course arrived at 950pm and the host seated us immediately not looking upset since this place closes at 1030. The five of us were seated in a cozy and spacious circular booth. The dining area still had plenty of patrons, a few parties were in large groups. \nThe ambiance and decor was nice, appeared smaller in pics than in actuality. But I like that it was a trendy and clean looking restaurant. \nOur server, Rolando was excellent. We ordered to share everything since we were going to a club after dinner. We had for starters a green iceberg salad, the hamachi sashimi that was topped with uni and Hokkaido scallop two ways (pan seared and sashimi topped with a lemon like ceviche) \nEverything was good, my GF just didn't like that they didn't offer ranch with the salad dressing. My favorite started was the spoon of hamachi and uni, incredible flavor mixed together in one phenomenal bite. \nFor dinner we ordered the lamb chops, prime rib and bone in rib eye with the side of lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach and grilled brussel sprouts. Everything was amazinggggg. My favorite was the bone in rib eye, that was topped with a truffle butter. This has to be one of my favorite steaks. Living in so cal we have plenty of steak restaurants and this has to be tied with my favorite Mastro's. \nI forgot to mention after the starters and before the entrees Rolando brought us complimentary palate cleansers. I have never heard of this before, I don't remember what he said it was...something along the lines of pancotta cheese and mango raspberry something. It was amazing, it really cleaned our palates for the amazing meal we were about to indulge in. \nAfter dinner we decided to skip dessert, but Rolando brought another complimentary slice of cake that was personalized to say happy  Birthday Kristine. \nThe service was 100% Rolando and his runner were quick to refill our drinks and set up our dinner plates since we were sharing everything. \nDinner was also cheaper than expected, but that maybe cause we didn't order any alcohol.

We both agreed that it looks different in day light..we both have been at night for a birthday party when it became a lounge and for networking events.  Still very nice ambiance though I don't see the hype in the bathroom.\n\nI got the Caesar salad, but asked the waitress if I can substitute the Casear dressing since I don't eat Caesar salads, she said the kitchen could substitute it for an orange shallot vinaigrette.  I greatly appreciated it and it was a nice refreshing dressing to balance out the salad.  I enjoyed the complimentary bacon bread that they gave as well.  It was soft and had a nice hint of bacon taste.  He opted for the clam chowder instead of one of the salads, he said it was pretty standard and a little on the thin side.  We both got the boneless ribeye with miso sauce, shishito pesto, and mustard seeds.  It was a nice portion of juicy beef cooked medium rare per requested.  It wasn't too fatty either.  I think the steak could have been done without all those mustard seeds.  The shishito pesto gave the steak a little kick and the miso was subtle.  We shared the marble potatoes ($10) as a side.  It was little potatoes with bacon, cheddar, sour cream.  These were pretty good, but bf thought they could be cooked a little longer.  For dessert we had a trio of honey fondant, butterscotch tapioca, and passionfruit chocolate mousse.  Our favorite was the light butterscotch tapioca with the fresh berries..this isn't the tapioca served for dessert at Chinese restaurants.  The chocolate mousse and the fondant were fine, but not extraordinary.  \n\n5a5 is a nice place to enjoy a good steak.  I wouldn't say it can replace our favorite Alexander's or Harris' but you won't be disappointed if you have a meal here.  Their happy hour menu looks enticing too, I may have to come back for that as well.  3.5 stars.", "author": "Cat C."}

I also loved one of my friend's wagyu as well (but mine was still better...). Our waitress was really warm and friendly and gave us some sample bites to help us decide what to get. The place itself is also quite large. We came on a weekday and had made reservations. Hence, were seated right away. Not sure of the wait times on a weekend but I would certainly make reservations again to assure quick seating.\n\nI also had the \"First Glance\" and \"Beast of Burden\" which were both good, not superb, but good (somewhat watered down).

Plenty of small bites and appetizers for $5. I would say the Truffle Fries with Sriracha Aioli was the best fries I've ever eaten in my life. I've eaten truffle fries at Gordan Ramseys, and that just doesn't even compare to this place. Their fries are a golden brown and crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside. It's absolutely perfect. You can taste the salt and the truffle oil on the outside. I'm already drooling thinking about it.\n\nFilet Mignon - one of the best filet mignons I've ever eaten. Very soft. I got it Rare Plus, which was in between rare and medium rare. It's still red in the middle, but there wasn't much blood/juice flowing out of it. The meat is a la carte, so do order the sides or else this won't fill you up!\n\nPrime Rib - not as good as House of Prime Rib, but still pretty good. I suggest you go for the bone-in steaks or the filet mignon. I'd pass on this next time. Also a la carte, so ordering sides or appetizers is a good idea.\n\nTruffle Mac and Cheese- Absolutely bomb! 3 different kinds of cheeses and perfect for sharing as a side. I don't think anyone would want to eat the whole thing by themselves as it is kind of heavy. Not large portions, but pretty dense. \n\nService - their service was amazing. Bathrooms is interesting. I suggest you go check it out.  As we got our menu, they took out the platter of raw wagyu, telling us the difference between all the cuts.. but hey, it's not like we can afford that 150 dollar piece of meat, but it's nice learning about the cuts. We got a buffalo croquette courtesy of the chef and for dessert, we got a tiny madeleine cookie also courtesy of the chef. Tiny little bites on tiny plates.

Its marvelous, delicious, mouth watering - basically any word that can describe tastey! If I could, I would give rate this place a million help stars!!!\n\nAnyways, my boyfriend and I came here to celebrate Valentine's - the week after the real Valentine's day. I called to make a reservation and glad I did. Although there were some empty tables, they filled up quite quickly. The customer service here is great. We changed our original reservation from 6PM to 5PM and they were very accommodating. After our arrival, we were greeted by the host and seated immediately. The atmosphere of this place was great! It was very contemporary modern - from the ceiling to the tables to the art on the wall. \n\nOur server was extremely attentive and friendly. When we told him we were interested in ordering wagyu, he brought us a plate of all of the wagyu the place offers. He also gave us recommendations and they were great recommendations. You could see the marble clearly in all of the wagyu cuts. My boyfriend ended up ordering the filet mignon wagyu and I ordered the rib eye wagyu. The wagyu steak was so tender. It was cooked perfectly. The chef here is great! Yea, the wagyu steak was a good grade and cut, but if it were not for the chef, the wagyu steak would not have turned out so delicious! Right when you put the wagyu steak in your mouth, it melts completely on your tongue and in your mouth. I can still taste it as I am describing it! The best steak I've ever had in my life. I would advise everyone to order just the 4oz because the marble will become overwhelming if it is any bigger. Before I forget, prior to our wagyu steak was brought to us, our waiter brought us the chef special which consisted of small portions of soup and an acidic dessert. The chef's special was delicious as well. \n\nWe also ordered the truffle mac and cheese. It was good, but it is not any where comparable to the wagyu steak. I wish I had eaten the Mac n cheese prior to eating my wagyu. Maybe they could bring our the appetizer prior to the entree? We ended the day with ordering the snores dessert. It was pretty good.

I normally come to 5A5 to party on the weekends, but this was my first time dining here. Link to my lounge review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/5a5-lounge-san-francisco-2#hrid:7KmhMkAeZADz4O92SXKIpw \n\nWe arrived at 8:30 PM for our 8:15 PM reservations because we got held up at HH (I did inform the hostess we were running late). Upon arrival, we were seated immediately.\n\nF O O D:\n*HAMACHI SHOOTER w/ Avocado, Ginger, Yuzu, Tobiko, Ponzu ($4)\n*OYSTER SHOOTER w/ Compressed Watermelon, Thai Sauce ($4)\n*SALMON SHOOTER w/ Shiitake, Green Onion, Kabayaki, Red Radish ($4) \n\nRather than go into detail for each one, I found ONE common theme among the shooters, the bold citrus/acidic flavors from the accoutrements (e.g. ginger, watermelon, radish) and sauces overpowered the delicate flavor of the fish/oyster so much so, that the natural taste of the sea got completely lost in it. \n\n*TRUFFLE FRIES w/ Sriracha Aioli ($9): ADDICTING! \n\nOf all the dishes we ordered, the truffle fries were my absolute fav! The taste and texture of the fries resembled one that had been double fried. It had an ultra crispy flakey cracker-like crispiness throughout w/ a soft center. It was perfectly seasoned w/ a robust earthy and woodiness from the truffle oil. The sriracha aioli perfectly complemented the fries adding a kick of heat w/ a touch of citrus to help balance some of the richness. \n\n*6 OZ. FILET MIGNON w/ Foie Gras, Boursin Cheese Fondue & Demi Glaze ($26 + $20 for Foie Gras): MEH!\n\nMy filet was overcooked to a medium (requested medium rare), over salted and lacked tenderness. I love foie gras and thought adding it to the filet would provide that extra layer of fatty decadence which would take it over the top. Sadly, it didn't. Although the foie gras was rich and fatty (to be expected), it had an overpowering salty and muskiness to it which hindered the beefy flavor of the filet. The cheese fondue added a touch of creamy savoryness, but it also added yet another layer of salt. I think someone failed to take into account the natural saltiness in cheese when seasoning the filet. :X\n\nI just don't seem to have luck w/ finding a good steak in SF as all the good steaks I've eaten have been at LV restaurants. \n\n*TRUFFLE MAC 'N CHEESE w/ Gruyere, Mozzarella & Cheddar ($9): SALT LICK!\n\nUnfortunately, the mac 'n cheese was just wrong on all levels. The elbow noodles were overcooked and borderline mushy. The trio of cheeses was overpowered by the topping of cheddar which was very sharp and pungent. There was distinct amount of woodiness from the overuse of truffle oil and that coupled w/ the cheeses created a very unappetizing saltiness and pungency. It also lacked a burnt cheese/bread crumb crust to give a crisp texture contrast. \n\n*SAUTEED SPINACH w/ Crispy Kataifi ($8): GOOD!\n\nThe spinach was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It maintained a vibrant green color and still had a bite to it. Crispy kataifi (shredded phyllo dough) crowned the spinach adding a delicate crunchiness.  \n\n*FRIED CHEESECAKE w/ Pineapple Sauce ($9): YUMMY!\n\nI was full but needed some sweetness to wash out the lingering saltiness in my mouth. Our waiter recommended this and we thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nThe dollops of cheesecake filling was batter dipped and fried to a honey golden brown. The fried cheesecake was light and crunchy on the outside and fluffy and velvety smooth in the inside. The sour cream in the filling along w/ the sweet pineapples created the perfect balance of sweet, savory and tartness. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was friendly, attentive and unpretentious. He went over the menu, offered suggestions, promptly took our orders and check on us frequently w/o being intrusive.  Our apps came out w/in 5 minutes and our entrees/sides came out mins after our apps were taken away. We ordered, ate, and got the bill w/in an hour which is quick considering 5A5 was packed. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nClassy retro sheek is the best way to describe 5A5 especially w/ the red orangey yellow ambient lighting, plushy ivory booths w/ contrasting dark furnishings in the bar/lounge area (from my 5A5 lounge review).\n\n5A5 gets loud especially on Fri and Sat nights so I HIGHLY recommend you dining there early (5 PM - 7 PM), otherwise people who come for the lounge will be lingering around your table and you'll have music thumping in your ears.  \n\nP A R K I N G:\nEasy street parking on weekdays before 6 PM. Difficult street parking on weekends. Valet is $8. \n\nPerhaps the kitchen was having an \"off\" day or maybe I have unrealistic expectations after being spoiled by the steaks at LV. Whatever the reasons, properly seasoning your food and properly cooking your steak (if you're a steakhouse) are BASICS that unfortunately 5A5 failed on.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

They were cooked to perfection and can I say a punch of flavor??? I have never experienced my steak with that much flavor that had my taste buds doing a lil dance at every bite! \n\nmy BF got the bone in ribeye and that thing was HUGE! so tender and juicy, he was googly eyed at the sight of it. \n\nI got the 4oz dry aged NY strip steak and can I say WOW!!! It comes with tabasco beurre blanc, red onion jam, crisp onion and those flavor combos were orgasmic to say the least! the spice of the tabasco mixed in with the sweetness of the red onion jam just married so well that you just couldnt get enough of it. I can say that this is one of my favorite steak's out of all the ruth chris, morton's, and the likes that ive tried in the past. \n\nWe also got the shrooms and brussels sprouts for our apps and while I loved the shrooms, I've had better brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were a bit too tough/under cooked for my liking and I just didnt like the spices they used. It could fancy other's but i did not like it at all. \n\nI loved the ambiance as well. My BF and I were on our short vacay to SF and this couldnt have been a more nicer spot to have our dinner at together. \n\nService A+, Food A+, Ambiance A+, go check it out! \n\nLK", "author": "Lorie K."}

This place is pricy for sure but the service and quality is evident.\n\nFor starters I tried their Hamachi Bite - yummy for sure with a bit of a kick - though the spicy kick takes a bit away from tasting the actual fish it was A-OK. Next time I would have tried the Wagyu - steak tartare in a single bite, though I just didn't know how I felt about spending 12 dollars for just a bite. Truffle fries were great! I wish the actual fries had more potato and didn't look like the bottom of the bunch but the truffle seeped through and was great. Tako Salad - tako worked really well with the kimchi flavor of the salad - sliced very thin it was a nice light touch.\n\nThe winner of my night was the Dry Aged Bone-In NY. BACON JAM? Sound yummy, well it is, it comes smothered in this goodness. The steak itself was a little bit uneven but the inside was just the medium rare that I enjoy. Not only that, this treasure is topped with a SOUS VIDE \"PERFECT\" EGG, just complements the bacon jam and steak so well. \n\nThe sides were just OK - creamy spinach and truffled mac & cheese added substance to the meal but was not anything too special. If you're feeling for deserts I would try not to miss out - both their s'more and caramel apple deserts were deconstructed greatness :) good way to top off the meal.\n\nDecor is reminiscent of a Vegas buffet almost. :) Worth the try if you're willing to spend.", "author": "Tracy Joy K."}

We showed up a little early for our reservation, we were coming for the dine about town menu. We went to the bar and had a drink while we waited. The bartender was nice enough but there were some people next to us who wanted to know what was cracking around the area trying to get wasted, real bros so I was like uhh this is the wrong place for that. Anyway we get seated and we start our experience.\n\nAmbiance: the place has a real modern feel with a little class built in. The bathrooms were really clean and pretty unique which I liked. The sink was real progressive and the stalls each had a private door. The restaurant has a pretty good view into the kitchen so you can watch the chefs work which was neat. Pretty dressy but not suit dressy just nice shirt and maybe a tie.\n\nService: the server was really nice and very attentive to us which we liked. Always bringing us water and asking if we need anything whatever have you, they were there to help us.\n\nFood: the food was ridiculous. We had the Wagyu sliders and it may have ruined all other burgers for me. We were too broke for Wagyu steak so the sliders are the cheaper option for my ballers on a budget. Still tasty as hell. In between apptizers and entrees and dessert the chef would bring out little bits for us to nibble on the house, I really liked that. He's a cool dude. We ended up getting steak because it's a steak house and it was really juicy and tender. Not the most amazing steak ever but it was up there. For dessert we had chocolate mousse and an orange cake of sorts and they both were good but the chocolate was my favorite. \n\nOverall a great date night for me. Everything was really great.

The place wasn't that busy for a Saturday night but somehow they messed up on our order pretty badly.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive but they initially brought out the wrong appetizer which they corrected quickly but then brought out the wrong steak entirely.  It took them a solid 15+ minutes to bring out the correct steak for my friend at which point the rest of us were 3/4 done with our entrees.  We know this kind of thing happens at restaurants and, to me, it's more about how you address the mistake versus the mistake itself.  Ultimately, they apologized for the delay and mistake but did nothing to rectify the issue, which I think is unacceptable.  We could see them analyzing us and determining whether or not they should do anything, they decided to do nothing which was a mistake on their part, for that reason we'll never go back and I'll steer my friends to Bourbon Steak or even Harris'.\n\nThat all being said: the steak was very good and the other dishes were quite good, the truffle mac n' cheese and foie gras were excellent.

Can we get some food and service to live up to the price point?\n\nOkay, I admit the storm is far from epic, but people are panicking and seriously... shouldn't they up their game on a night like this when people aren't going out... especially on a Thursday?!!\n\nFirst, the service was horrendous. \n- Our waiter was beyond disinterested.

I had to get out of my seat to request a new fork. He finally came when I was on the last bite of my appetizer. I ate scallops and wagyu sashimi with a knife...\n- We weren't offered a dessert menu\n- Bill was dropped off before we were done\n- ZERO apologies for all the major service faux pas\n\nFood was dry and overcooked.\n- Medium rare should never cooked all the way through\n- Medium rare should never be dry\n- Why would you take an amazing cut of bone-in ribeye and cook the life out of it?? It looked like it would be AMAZING... a huuuge ribeye about 3-4 inches thick... HOW DO YOU OVERCOOK THAT?? What a waste. Same goes for the lamb.\n- $100+ worth of meat that tastes the same as something you can get at Outback (or worse) is not acceptable\n\nLet me note that we were not high maintenance diners.

Service was really slow and the place had become jam packed by the time we ordered. The appetizers were delicious but they took forever to come out. My husband ordered lobster bisque for his next course and it came out cold; he sent it back and it came out even more cold the second time, so they gave up and offered us drinks instead. They were also out of bone marrow, so he had a steak without any accompaniments. Overall, it was a nice place, but they weren't prepared for the capacity on NYE.

First course was hamachi and maguro shooters.  Both were okay... lots of fixings and I remember one of them being too tart.  Second course, I tried the daikon soup and the bacon wrapped scallops.  Daikon soup was refreshing.  It had a baby food consistency with thin slices of apples.  Baked wrapped scallops was very typical and uninteresting to eat.  \n\nNow onto my main dish: the T-bone.  I requested it to be cooked medium rare and it was ever so slightly over that which made it more tough.  It was covered with bone marrow based sauce and it gave a milky sheen over it.  I wasn't a big fan because it just tasted like fat over it but it didn't enhance the steak at all.  Many were debating between the 22 oz. T-bone and the 10oz. filet.  The server will tell you that with a T-bone, you get both a New York strip AND the filet but realistically, the filet is much smaller on the T-bone.  \n\nFor dessert, I had the bread pudding which was a bit dry throughout.  I didn't even finish it and I normally love bread pudding!  As for drinks, I would highly recommend the lychee martini.  It is light and tastes like juice.  Dangerous stuff.\n\nIf you're planning a private party, the \"mezzanine\" is actually still pretty much in the main room, just two steps (literally) above.

But I will attempt to provide an unbiased review at any rate.\n\nLast night my family celebrated the holidays with dinner at 5A5.  I booked the Chef's Room which is an enclosed private room seating up to 14 people.  It's located on the main floor in back adjacent to the kitchen. We looked over four group menus prior and decided on the four course pre fixed $85.00 menu and paid $500 advance deposit over a month ago. Also must spend minimum $1k which is easy to accomplish with the total number of folks.\n\nWe waited in the bar while the room was being set up.  Ordered from the bar cocktail menu. Happy hour is between 5p-7p M-F.  Later we ordered more drinks but the Happy Hour prices not applicable outside the bar perimeter.\n\nOur server came in and took our drink orders.  Both warm sourdough and bacon sliced bread with butter on the side brought to the table.\n\nFrom the time our orders were taken, the food pacing was sporadic at best.  Course 1 and 2 were evenly paced, then it was a long lull until we got course 3. Then course 4 (dessert) was a longer lull, and we had to request coffee.  By the time coffee came, we were done with our warm lava cake which was so so. \n\nIt was a very leisurely dining experience, and not rushed. But verged on the edge of being inattentive as the evening wore on. \n\nMemorable - the daikon soup; the hamachi and maguro bites; and my filet mignon.\n\nFood - 4.0\nService 3.0", "author": "Shirley N."}

I emailed about a reservation 2 days in advance for 7pm to which they replied they had nothing at that time and to call in. I called in and they said they had something for 745, so I was like yeah, that totally works.\n\nGet there at 745 and they were like oh, your reservation was yesterday and we marked you as a no-show. Uhh.. definitely some mis-communication issues there. Luckily they had a table open and we still got seated right away. (otherwise I would have been hhhhangry --hungry/angry)\n\nThey were out of the prime rib so I had a filet mignon instead. Can't say that I regretted that. The carpaccio was amaaazing. I thought it would be steak, considering they are a steak house but low and behold, it was fish! Still equally delicious though. The truffle fries were great as well.

The filet mignon was so tender and juicy! \n\nSomething about me that people may not know - I am an incompetent knucklehead that sucks at planning and executing any type of dates, and therefore I was pretty stressed. Anyways, I took a friend here as a congratulatory gift for a promotion at work. Go figure, my reservation did not go through upon arrival (stress level at it's peak). Luckily, they were able to accommodate us last min. WHEW! +1 star. \n\nSince I've been here twice, I pretty much tried all the bites/starters and desserts. I'll have to say my favorites are the himachi, oysters, and the ever so delicious mac & and cheese. I'm not a M&C kinda girl, but this completely transformed me. It's a must. \n\nAs mentioned previously, I got the filet mignon, a small chunk of meat but mouthwatering and fulfilling to say the least. I liked it so much I got it again the second time. Yes, I'm not much of an experimenter when it comes to something I know I already liked. The thing is, I don't think most people will enjoy the filet as much as I did. People usually gear towards the more fatty and juicy ribeye looking type of steak. But who's to blame them. It's pretty darn good too. To each their own I guess. \n\nI have nothing to review about desserts. I had a piece here and there for each of them but nothing stood out enough for me to remember. I guess not remembering says a lot too? It's a steak house, not a bakery. + or - zero stars.\n\nOverall, if you take into account my additional +1 for my lack of competency to make reservations... I actually rated this place 4 stars. Misleading, but I do think this place is really good and highly recommended.  \n\nPLUS - Stephen Curry came here and took a picture with the owner so it must be good.

A nice amuse bouche, pleasant hamachi bite, and competent wait staff saved it from a worse rating.  But I went for the steak.\n\nMy steak, a dry aged t-bone, was surprisingly a bit tough.  Not overcooked, just not a great cut of meat.  And what I expected to be a light bell pepper coulis that complimented the steak, was in fact slathered over the whole thing and completely dominated the flavor.  So I had a tough red bell pepper-flavored steak for $48. My glass of red wine was passable, but not what one would expect of a restaurant with a capable sommelier.\n\nWhen you go to a steak house, you expect a great steak.  This wasn't even close.  I even felt that I had to mention the fact that the bell pepper coulis ruined what might have been an ok steak.  I rarely ever make such comments.  \n\nBottom line - if you're going to \"treat yo'self\" like I wanted to, go somewhere else.", "author": "William N."}

We went for a birthday dinner, made reservations, everything went smoothly. \n\nFood: We ordered a ton of different things...\nAppetizers: lobster tempura, yakimono shrimp, ribs & chips, and the truffle fries. The lobster tempura and the shrimp were amazing, the sauces were also great. The ribs & chips were ok- nothing too spectacular (the rib meat was super tough and so difficult to get off). The truffle fries (& whatever sauce it came w/) was delicious. I would definitely recommend the truffle fries, lobster tempura, and the shrimp. \nEntrees: veggie plate, two filet mignons, boneless rib eye, and the chicken. I had the boneless ribeye and it was pretty great. Comes with this pesto sauce on top, it's a little spicy and I didn't like the flavoring of the pesto too much (seeped into my steak a little too much). \nSides: mac n cheese, potatoes (mashed + gratin). sides were all absolutely amazing. The mac n cheese was soooo good and the mashed potatoes were the perfect kind of creamy. \n\nService: great!!!! Our waitress was so sweet. They have this cool trick they do, which I will not reveal- go find out for yourself! They also brought out sample one-bite appetizers and a little sample dessert place. And a birthday treat for the birthday boy, great artwork! \n\nThe only real downside to this place- it's SO loud.

I ordered the Bone in rib-eye with Pico de gallo and had it cooked medium which turned out to be well-done on one side (super sad face). Also, I did not like the pico de gallo or tomato salad they put on top of the steak, the combination was not very appetizing -- very tex-mex which I am not a fan of. The bill came out and was comparable to Alexander's steakhouse, however, we would much rather pay the same price for Alexander's than 5A5 Steak.\n\nOverall, the ambiance was very nice and intimate.

We didn't have a res so we sat at the bar. The bar could be a little cooler, but it didn't matter.  \n\nLindsey, our server/bartender got us started and we looked at the menu knowing that we only wanted first class steaks. We opened the menu to see a section listed as A5 Wagyu. We perused to see that an 8oz filet was $280!! We all chuckled and talked, picking out apps and so forth until we realized that we were here JUST for this reason. So we said, screw it, lets do it!  \n\nWe had two filets, and a ribeye- all certified A5 Wagyu beef direct from Japan.  \nYou ask, wtf does a $280 steak taste like? It can't be worth it! Ladies and Gents, it was hands down one of the best single bites let alone whole meals that I have ever tasted. It is an experience that, yes, not everyday we get to do these things, but we had special cause to really splurge, and splurge we did.  I want to talk about the amazing service, the fun amuse-bouche and thoughtful intermezzo's and wonderful apps and cool take on a wedge but this steak was unlike anything I have ever tasted.  The menu has a Japanese foundation to it, which adds to the complexity of the meal without stealing any spotlight whatsoever from the god-worthy piece meat that is real japanese Wagyu- you get a certificate of authenticity- of your steak!! \n\nHeres the kicker- the whole staff, was so amazing.  Our bartender was smart, fun and really rounded out our experience by being so knowledgeable and patient with us.  We are 3 guys who are old close friends so we were having a good ol' time.

Wasn't a fan our other app selections scallops 2 ways, not holding that again the restaurant that was our bad. Now to the steaks....I had the bone-in ribeye and she had the filet. Ordered medium rare and both came out rare and when I say rare it might have moo'd at us. Better undercooked than overlooked I guess. Also, steaks were very bland.

Good start.\n\nThe food and apps were pretty mixed. I ordered the ribeye and my girlfriend ordered the filet, medium rare for both. Both came out pretty medium. Some of the apps were great (hamachi spoons, shishito peppers, mashed potatoes come to mind) while others were not (steak tartare trying too hard with the wasabi flavor that overpowered and arguably ruined it, gnocchi that was pretty meh, etc). \n\nThe food here was good, but not amazing. The sticker shock is what I suppose left the most bitter taste in our mouths.

The waiter was very educated about the product and was comfortable making reocmmendations.\n-Waters refilled consistently.\n-Hip, modern, luxurious ambiance.\n\nCons:\n-Service could be slow at times.\n-Steak is just so-so.  For a steakhouse (er...steak lounge), I would expect their steaks to be really tasty, but I thought that they were just okay.  I guess I just didn't really care for the sauces they used.  I suppose I'm more of a steak purist (?), who just enjoys a simpler steak.  With that being said, the other people in my group really enjoyed their steaks, so it's just personal preference.  (I tried both the filet mignon and new york strip from the dine-about-town menu).\n\nOverall, the experience was solid.  I think Dine-about-town was a great opportunity to try out this restaurant.  The food, as a whole, is above-average, the service is friendly, and the place feels sort of fancy.

I had the A-1 steak which I think is a good steak to try- it's half wagyu and half australian- not as costly as the A5 but very tender and still melt in your mouth good.

They prepared the steaks medium for both of us and they were perfect.  We brought a bottle of wine and they charged a $25.00 corkage fee.   Lastly, the wait staff was beyond helpful.  Their service was amazing and made our dining experience wonderful!!\n\nAll-in-all the dinner was magnificent and I would recommend to anyone but be ready to drop at least $150 per person for a meal like this.

Went here for a surprise anniversary dinner and first impression about the place was wow, very classy and romantic. Keep in mind, there's no private parking, but there is valet and street parking. Valet was around $10, which isn't too bad; could pay cash upfront or add it to the tab inside the restaurant, just let the valet person know. Had reservation because it was on a weekend, better to be safe than sorry. The seating can be a little weird too because the furniture is very modern and contemporary. Overall, great service and great experience. Since it was a first time here, the server explained everything on the menu and what A5A actually stood for. Thought it was very interesting and clever. But for appetizers, ordered a spoon of hamachi, tuna, and salmon, to try a little bit of everything. The tuna had that fish taste, salmon was ok, but the hamachi was a favorite, it was very flavorful! Also ordered the chef's soup, which varies each day and which chef is cooking. As for the entrees, ordered ribeye bone in and ribeye boneless, let's just say, they know how to cook their steaks! Both were flavorful and cooked perfectly to how it was ordered. Even though no sides were ordered, the appetizers and entrees were both fulfilling. Being it was an anniversary dinner, they also gave a complimentary dessert. Yes this place is expensive, but the experience was great. FYI, instead of ordering a glass of wine, bring a bottle! Didn't know that option was available, but it is. Try this place out, every dollar is worth it.", "author": "Rochelle G."}

Meat was tender and looked filing to me needed a lil more seasoning\n\nanother friend had the dry aged T-bone- his steak was better presented and taste was much better in every way, melt in your mouth type steak. didn't need seasoning just rite they way they made it\n\nI had the bone-in ribeye my steak was also like butter when chomping down, flavor was good, portion was good, when getting to the middle of the steak it lacked the full taste that you would get when biting down on the outer sections of the beef, still this was a decent steak\n\nfood here was pretty good, definitely would come back with more friends, family or the wifey for a second taste.\n\nthere was a plate I was thinking of getting when I saw the menu until i saw one of the other patrons had ordered it and decided on the ribeye. The World Wide Wagyu is a plate that offers 3 different steaks one is chilean wagyu, second was an aussie wagyu, and last an american wagyu the cost of this plate was $145 held back from ordering this plate simply because the portion of each steak looked to be less then 4oz also because the meat seem to look like ground hamburger meat instead of an actual steak. I see it as this if your paying anywhere over the $100 mark the portion better well over what I can consume and on top of that the steak should look like a steak not ground hamburger meat haha\n\nfood ****\nservice ****\nprice $$$ steak wise if u stay away from the Wagyu you will spend between $20-$48 the Wagyu they charge by ounce between $9/oz to $20/oz\nambiance ***** good spot to meet friends for drinks if not a very decent meal", "author": "Clarence A."}

Although the food was very good, we were disappointed with our waitress, a young Asian lady. To start off, she was not very attentive. When we were ready to order she made a not so nice comment about us studying the menu prior to coming. First of all, the menu was not that complex so it didn't take us long to decide. Not sure why she said that, perhaps because we look young although we're in our late twenties. Well when we got our check, we put cash down and were waiting for her to bring us change. And she didn't bring us change assuming we are giving her the rest in tip and just walked by and said thank you. Are you serious?? It was a big amount left and either way we were planning to leave her a good tip (even though she did not deserve it), but to not at least come and ask us if we needed change or not?? To just pocket 20 percent to herself? It's not the amount that matters, it's the principle! So rude! She did not come back and was no where to be found. \nWhen we pay $200 for a damn meal we expect to get good customer service! Advise to manager - I hope your waitresses don't do this to other customers and just decide to pocket the change. \nWe were very excited to try this restaurant but felt the birthday was ruined. We would not recommend this restaurant unless management will train its staff how to accommodate their guests, especially if they try to be a 5 star restaurant.", "author": "mika l."}

We had an 8:00pm reservation for a party of 4. We arrived a little early so we were seated at their lounge area near the entrance while a table cleared.  We were in no rush and had a couple drinks. There was a group of load girls wearing short dresses with their ass cheeks out having drinks at the bar. I thought this place was classier.  I'd expect that if I'm about to drop at least $500 on dinner that the crowd would be dressed better but whatever, at least they wouldn't be sitting at my table. \n\nAt about 8:45 we were seated.  After about 10 minutes our waiter came to introduce himself and we told him we needed just a few more minutes to decide.  At about 9:30 he comes back to take orders and tell us the meat takes 45 minutes to cook.  Really?!?  This would have been nice to know upon seating us so that we could have ordered sooner.  Also, would have been nice if we'd gotten seated at the right time.  We ordered a few appetizers since we knew we had to wait 45 minutes for our meat to arrive.  Finally at almost 10:30 our food arrives.  food presentation was good, I was excited to dig in and then my boyfriend notices that his meat has been overcooked, he likes his meat rare, let me also mention that my boyfriend has never sent a dish back in the years that I've known him.  We call the waiter and he shows him that the meat is overcooked.  He sends the meat back and by this time I have lost my appetite.  The manager comes over and apologizes and tells us she will not charge us for our sides.  (Very nice of her) but that does still not compensate for it now being almost 11:00pm when we had an 8:00pm reservation.  \n\nI asked to have my food packed up to go.  My boyfriend ate some of his meat but our experience felt so long and draining that we all agreed it was time to call it a night.  It was now almost midnight.  We all felt exhausted.  Only good thing we took from the dinner was spending time with our friends and catching up.  \n\nOur bill was still over $500 and the service was terrible.  I don't plan on returning.  The food was good but not as good at other steakhouses in the city.  I'd much rather spend my time and money at Alexander's, Bobo's, House or Prime Rib, or Harris'.

We arrived about 40 minutes early for our Friday night reservation and they were able to get us seated almost immediately. \nWe started off with what my wife says was the best fried shrimp she has ever had, ever. I had the popcorn chicken. Little chunks of breast meat, crispy fried with a hint of sweet. It was excellent. \nFor dinner we each had the boneless rib eye, which was cooked and seasoned just right. They offer \"medium plus\" (somewhere between medium and medium well) which was perfect for me. My wife had hers medium and she says the chef nailed it. My favorite, even above the steak was the mac and cheese with giant chunks of candied bacon. this was amazing, and highly recommended. The place was well staffed and we were well taken care of with above excellent service. Every employee we came in contact with was nice, helpful and appeared to be genuinely happy which tells me that it's also a good place to work. We will be back on our next trip to san fran, and we will recommend this place to friends and family.", "author": "Adam M."}

We went for a birthday dinner and they treated us like VIPs. We even had one person come later after we had ordered steaks and they got her order in late and out to the table at almost the same time as our original meals. I would definitely go back.\n\nThe bathrooms were smelly which seemed weird. Might have just been an off night but it was sewage like and everyone commented on it.", "author": "Colin FX G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-08", "description": "5 second review: Yada Yada Yada, \"Sauced Steaks\"... Need I say more?\n\nNitty-Gritty Details:\n\nPulled up to Valet & upon receiving my ticket was asked immediately for payment. Whahh? Not sure if this is a common practice now, though took me aback as I've never before been asked to pay up-front. Maybe it was just me? Nope... Everyone in our group who valet parked said exactly the same thing & were just as puzzled as I... Whatever, not too big a deal..., just seemed a bit unusual...\n\nWalked through the doors & met our party in the lounge area as we awaited our table. Had a decent party size & a reserved room/table to celebrate a double birthday celebration. First server escorted us down the stairs to an isolated & desolate (almost Goodfellas like, sans the plastic/tarp lined carpeting & chairs) seating area, which looked more appropriate for a corporate event with the projectors, etc... The WORST part however was this particular area had a very distinct & impossible to dismiss smell of vomit. Others compared the smell to sitting in a restroom, which was exactly where the \"unisex\" restrooms happened to reside as well... Minutes later, another host came downstairs to apologize that we were mistakenly taken to the wrong area (THANK GOD) & escorted us back to the main floor to a private room towards the back of the restaurant...\n\nAs far as ambiance, no complaints... Decent layout & the private room was very nice, though with a \"Boardroom\" type feel... Server as well was very attentive & did an excellent job to assure everything was to everyone's liking. Food however? Well, that's another story...\n\nConsidering we had requested a private room, we were given an option for the 4 Course Prix-Fixe menu (which on paper, appeared pretty decent). Started out with Hamachi Bites (avocado, ginger, yuzi toiko, scallion & ponzu) as well as the Magura Bites (jalapeno, basil, cilantro, citrus fish sauce, shiitake), though both were pretty standard. Out of the two options however, I'd give the edge to the Maguro Bites as it had a tartness to it as well as a slight bite from the jalapeno...\n\nNext up were the U-10 Scallops (chimichurri sauce, salsa cruda, oi sobagi & trout roe) as well as the Soup du jour (Oyster & Leek Bisque). Once again, no real standout options or anyone proclaiming out loud, \"OMG, did you try the...\" (no, didn't happen...) Scallops were seemingly fresh, cooked well, with a nice density to them though aren't notorious (in general) for melding well with other flavors/sauces. The leek bisque was extremely light & you could barely make out the faint hint of oyster...\n\nOnto the main course... I opted for the Dry Aged T-Bone (22oz, stuffed gypsy pepper, bell pepper coulis), medium-rare. Very well presented & cooked perfectly. Flavor-wise however? Yes, though the steak was very juicy/decent marbling, I'm not a big fan (not a fan at all actually) of sauced steaks... A dab or brush of butter at times is appropriate, though relying on slathered sauce to flavor the steak basically means the meat itself is more than likely bland underneath... If I'm visiting a legit steakhouse, you will never hear the famous alphanumeric characters \"A1\" ever come out of my mouth. If you do, something is horribly wrong... That being said, why pay a premium when I could get an average \"sauced\" experience going to Denny's & ordering the NY with a big ass bottle of A1 to assist with flavor enhancement & meat lubrication (giggidy?)... You'll never get the true flavors of the meat as the sauce will mask or enhance whatever it touches... If the cut is of high quality, then a preparation of salt & pepper alone are typically enough to do your steak justice... Regardless, 5A5's cut was definitely NOT Denny's quality (nowhere near the same ballpark)... This was a very good cut of meat with it's flavors/potential, hidden beneath the sauce coating... Still decent, though not my cup of tea...\n\nLastly, out came the dessert... Simple chocolate dessert; Multi-layer, chocolate/mousse sliver of cake with a wafer-crisp crust & a dab of a citrus sorbet on the side. Very simple, though quite good... Honestly, I'd say the highlight of the meal...\n\nIn summary, we came here for one thing & one thing alone..., to have a good time & for that, they definitely succeeded... Service was Excellent, there was a decent drink selection (though they need to step-up their game & get the appropriate chalice/goblet if they're going to serve Chimay), etc... We laughed, we toasted, we ate... Bottom line was, they were very good hosts & we all had a blast, despite the inflated pricing on an above average dining experience... Will I be back? Take a look at the pic of the bill... I could easily think of a 100 other places within the general vicinity where my $$$$ could be stretched a lot further, with the entrees themselves resulting in a \"food-gasm\" after every bite... Still an overall enjoyable experience, though as stated prior, not my cup of tea... 3-1/2 Stars...", "author": "Bryan R."}

To think that my sis dropped $500 on this crap... never again.\n\nWe missed our reservation... so we ended up eating at their \"lounge\" area. Great.

What's the deal there? \n\nUnfortunately, I don't remember what my sis ordered but here's what I remembered eating:\n\n- truffle fries = this was actually good... fries were crispy... it's one of those very addicting appetizer.\n\n- 10 oz slow roasted prime rib = this came really juicy... but the fat content was another story. I ended up cutting through the fat... it made me cringe cutting them off.\n\n- sous vide baby carrots = right portion and good enough to share with the group.\n\n- truffled mac & cheese = loved this... though it got a bit too overwhelming during dinner.\n\nOur server was nice... we can't complain about her. She was there checking up on us and was friendly and prompt. \n\nWhat killed the experience was the management and its patron that surrounded us during dinner.

I came here for Dine About Town, so I can only judge by that. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, and I found it to be quite expensive for something that tasted watered down. ): Our server was really nice though, and recommended a good wine that was not going to break our wallets.\n\nFood-wise, I had the following:\n+ Daikon soup: this had blue crab meat and fuji apple, with some seaweed. I find it to be quite delicious for something that seemed a bit odd to me. It had a good, consistent texture with flavors that were not too overwhelming with the other ingredients.\n- Ribeye steak: this had peppercorn sauce and shiitake mushrooms. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed because I love my steaks rare. It seems that only Europeans only know how to cook steaks rare, properly. My steak must have been medium-rare, at best, so I did not enjoy it. ): The sauce was tasty though, and the portion was generous, but I am going to dock my rating down because this place is a STEAK lounge and I was not satisfied.\n+ Triple chocolate mousse cake: I was glad that I was able to get this without the nuts. It was quite yummy without being overly sweet. The complementing ice cream also went well with it.\n\nOverall, for Dine About Town, I did not think it was entirely worth it, but it is the experience that counts.

The decor, the lighting and most importantly, the pianist were absolutely fantastic (does he have a CD?).  I could have sat there all night and not eat....\n\nI had to really think about this review before I decided at two stars (one for the ambience, one for the pianist).  I am by NO means an expert in meat.  I eat it and know what I like and that's where it ends.  I don't like meat drenched in sauces because I'm a big fan of taste and flavor of the actual cut--especially filet.  So my experience is what it is and so be it.   SOOOOOOO......In a nutshell, my american cut 6 oz filet (as opposed to japanese wagyu cut) was not served warm.  It was served (with sauce on it) and two bites in, I realized that although cooked to medium like I requested, it was room temperature/borderline cold.  So I send it back and request for a new piece of meat since \"throwing it back on the grill\" when it has sauce on it seems weird to me.  Out of our party of four, two of us sent the meat back because it wasn't warm.  I asked for the sauce to be held this time.  My new piece of meat came and was warm, but as I live and breathe, had an odd flavor and odor to it.  Now again, I'm no expert, but that was not a fresh piece of meat.  It STUNK.  Don't tell me it was pre-cooked or from last night and just warmed up on the grill?  (Which would explain why it was borderline cold???)  I don't know and don't care.  It was old and starting to turn and not edible.  Maybe this was just an off night?  Maybe I should've drenched it in sauce so I didn't notice?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-05", "description": "From the food to the attentive service to the pricing, this place is fantastic. In fact, last night's meal at 5A5 for my wife's birthday sparked a lively debate about what a restaurant would have to do to deserve 5 stars. While you could safely state that French Laundry deserves 5 stars for their food/service, how would you separate a 4-star from a 5-star one in restaurant dense SF? Here was the argument I put forth to my friends justifying this rating based on my wife and friends meal last night.\n\nFood: We had a nice mix at our table and I'm glad that we could see the breadth of their capabilities. \n\n\n* We knew the meal was going to be good when we found the Suzuki starter to be both delicious AND decently proportioned. It's nice to see a restaurant that charges $15 for appetizer actually bother to return value to the diner. It was nice to have more than one bite per diner and the mix of flavors and textures was well executed.\n\nAt this price point, you expect steakhouses in SF to offer quality meats (including dry aged cuts) and cook them properly. What sets this place apart was the chef's \"extra preparations\" that really made each bite worth savoring. If you just want a big chunk of quality beef, I'd suggest Harris or HPR. If you want something different, try 5A5.\n\n* I had the Boneless Ribeye steak. This one was prepared with a two sauces: a shishito pesto and some lightly pickled bits o' stuff. While I'm always hesitant to order ribeyes at steakhouses as I find them a bit fatty, the flavors promised on the menu were worth trying. I was not wrong and this steak was delightful for every bite.\n\n* One of my friends had the Dry Aged Bone in NY Steak. With the bacon jam and sous vide egg, it had an amazingly rich, almost barbecue sauce flavor added on top of the meat. We won the prize for best steak at this meal\n\n* My other friend had the prime rib. It was a quality cut of prime rib, the crust had great flavor from the dry rub but it was only a tad bit better than HPR. I'm sure she'll order something else on her next visit.\n\n* My wife had a traditional filet. It was cooked properly and had good flavor (for a filet) but to be honest, I would have expected nothing less. I'd also like to note that they are quite up front about the size. Nothing pisses me off more to order a steak for $33 and find that they've just served me 4 bites of food (here's looking at you Baker & Banker and your tiny, mediocre flat iron steak).\n\n* The desserts: while I'm not a smoker, the sazerac w/ a tobacco ice cream float was tempting enough to try. The tobacco was a bit tingly which my friends tell me is exactly how cigarettes taste. I thought it was quite good and definitely worth sampling (the dessert, not the cancer sticks). They also brought out a nice dessert (san alcohol) for my wife which was a nice touch.\n\n* \"The Extras\": I'm not sure if these items were delivered because it was my wife's birthday but all the little extras made this meal quite special. From the amuse-bouche to the palette cleanser to the last small cookies at the end of the meal, I must say that these little touches DO make the meal great.\n\nThe Service: From the minute the hostess wished my wife a happy birthday, everyone was quite friendly and welcoming for our entire party. I cannot speak highly enough about the friendly waitstaff.\n\nDecor: While this is at the very bottom of my list of things to care about when it comes to dining (I love Shalimar even with its formica walls and flourescent lighting), it's refreshing to see a steakhouse decorated in some other fashion than your classic smokey \"good old boys\" club. The upside was that the seating was still comfy despite its modern look (my 8mo pregnant wife didn't have to sit on some futuristic yet awful chair for our meal).\n\nThe Price/Value: While this restaurant is by no means cheap and the conspicuous consumers can certainly blow their money on multi-hundred dollar chunks of meat, I've had far worse meals in SF for a good deal more money. Just like Kokkari next door, I appreciated the quality and portions of the meal for the price charged.\n\nWe'll definitely be back.\n-g", "author": "Gunn S."}

Sadly, I had misjudged (or just wasn't paying attention), and booked it on the wrong night. So when we, a group of four hungry people just out of work, came to 5A5, we didn't have a reservation and it was packed to the gills in their dining area. \n\nThe hostess was very accommodating however and said she would fit us in as best she could and gave us a rough estimate of 35-50 minutes. Which I thought was fair. She promptly seated us in the lounge and a waitress was already ready to take our cocktail orders. We had some good conversation, some A5 waygu sashimi, and when it finally came time, the hostess let us know politely there were still a few people enjoying their meals. She gave us another rough estimate. We were willing to wait. \n\nAfter about an hour we were seated. Which I thought was good timing. We tried all of the cuts of the A5 waygu steak. The A5 waygu ribcap was by far our favourite. It melted in your mouth like butter. While I will say the price point for the A5 steak cuts is rather steep, I will say it's worth it. I will also tell you, you need to get two 4 oz of two cuts you prefer and not just one single 8 oz. \n\nIn the end with plenty of cocktails ( 2-3 each ), appetizers, wine ( full bottle ), A5 waygu steaks ( six 4 oz A5 cuts, and one F1 cut ), split amongst 4 people, our bill only ended up being ~$1300, which honestly. I felt was not as bad as it could have been considering the quality of the meat. \n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Sara M."}

Maybe to get a good cut of meat you have to get the wagyu. The apps were good. I enjoyed the lobster tempura and the wagyu sliders but the rest of the meal was SUBPAR. Their meat isn't even grass fed. How do you tout yourself as an upscale steak house when your steaks are the same quality of Black Angus?! I had the rib eye and my boyfriend had the filet mignon. We both had left overs and he gave his filet to his pit bull. Wise chose as it wasn't suitable for human consumption. We had the truffle mac and cheese and it was doused in truffle oil. It smelled like it was going to erupt in flames with all the oil used it in. No shaved truffles on top- just doused in truffle oil. We ate two bites and left it. Who doesn't finish Mac and Cheese?! That's how bad it was. But the bigger question is how do you f up Mac and Cheese? We also had the Brussels sprouts. They should be called lemon greens. They were horrible. If I wanted lemonade I'd order lemonade.\nAnother miss. . . They don't have champagne coolers for the table. Every time I wanted to refill my glass I had to wait for the waiter to notice since I couldn't access my bottle of Vueve. One highlight? The bacon bread. That was incredible.

There is a main floor and a level below, accessed by an elevator, once the elevator opens, you can walk straight forward for the toilets. There are no doors, it's quite interesting, you'll see the faucets, and there are individual stalls. I also believe these are where the more private dining areas are for larger groups. \n\nService: Awesome, knowledgeable and personable. Came by at the right time and made sure we felt comfortable. She said she worked there for 5 years, which gave her enough time to sample everything on the menu if we needed any recommendations. \n\nFood: We did the A5 Experience. Melt in your mouth. If you have the means, definitely go for this. I'm pretty sure it's ruined all other types of meat for my boyfriend. Presented nicely, each 4 oz. piece was cooked perfectly. Our server said for the last piece, which had the most marbling, could be cut with a fork. It did. And I couldn't resist, I love potato au gratin, so I ordered one to accompany the dinner, it was very creamy and were made with different types of potatoes. (And still good the next day, could not finish, had to take home) For dessert I got the sorbet because everything we had for dinner was so rich. So many different flavors, I loved the passion fruit the orange was such a kick in the mouth.

For those of you who don't know where the 5A5 comes from and what it's meant to represent.\n\n5A5 is one of the best rating in a Meat Grading System standard used in Japan.  \nHere 5A5 Steak Lounge refers to the 5 senses and the A5 Experience.\n\nIn Japan meat is rated by:\n\nBeef Marbling (BMS)\nColor and Brightness (BCS)\nFirmness and Texture of the meat\nQuality of Fat (BFS)\nThe overall meat quality score is graded down to the lowest grade of the 4 ratings.\n\nThere is also another rating for the stamping of meat quality score.\n\nThe highest rating a  meat can have is a  \"A5\" rating.  Standing for one of the best meats.\nSome of the best meat are produced as what we call Wagyu (Literally Japanese Cow).  Not all Wagyu are rated \"A5\" class.\n\nExecutive Chef Allen Chen (Alexander's Steakhouse) has developed an outstanding menu which both complements and explores the boundaries of the traditional 'steak & potatoes' fare.\nSo with this said and done....one must experience the 5A5 Steak Lounge.\n\nTo start of our meal we began with a few appetizers.\n\nTruffle Fries - Fried in Truffle Oil and served with Sriracha Aioli.  Tasty and excellent dipping sauce (Sriracha Aioli).  \nRating - 4 Star\n\nYakimono Shrimp - Garlic Lemon Marinade served with soy dipping sauce.  This dish I think the shrimp was over cooked.  It was dry and difficult to remove from it's shell.  \nRating - 2 Star.\n\nFor our main we had ordered the:\n\nSlow Roasted Prime Rib - Garlic, mustard rub served with aq jus.  15 oz.  They had offered to serve me 3 thin slices or one thick slice.  I chose the thin slice but should have chosen the thick slice.  I found the thin slice was a little difficult to cut because the knife was not very sharp and the Prime Rib was very tender.  The Prime Rib was absolutely fabulous.  \nRating 4.5 star.\n\nJasmine Tea Smoked Chicken - served with Asparagus puree, grilled white asparagus and papaya salad.  This dish was ok....a good dish for people who are non-meat eaters.\nRating 3.5 star.\n\nWe had 2 sides to accompany our main dishes.\n\nPotato Au Gratin - This was a very nice well prepared dish.  Thinly sliced potatoes.\nRating 4 star\n\nMac and Cheese - This comes with three different types of cheese.  Gruyere, Mozzarella and Cheddar.  Very tasty.\nRating 4 star\n\nFor our desert we had the following:\n\nLychee, Hot Chocolate and Cookies.  Both these items were excellent.\nRating 4 Star\n\nThe ambiance at 5A5 is very nice and kozy.  If you are there on a date or with a significant other....do not sit facing a larger table with 5 girls celebrating a special occasion.  I quote a small piece of conversation:  \"Umm...Alan....do you want to sit at the other table!?\"....(Me)...\"Ummm.....no....I don't know any of them\"....\n\nOk...enough said.\n\nI loved this place.  I didn't get to try the Wagyu which I plan to on my next visit.  With the exception of the Yakimono Shrimp I'd recommend all the other dishes I had.  \nPeople here are very nice.

Plentiful crab meat and the fuji apple added a nice touch.\n\nEntrees-\nRibeye Steak w/peppercorn sauce, shiitake- Cooked perfectly medium rare, the meat was nice and fatty, but the sauce was a bit too peppery for my liking. Shiitakes were a nice touch and was a nice break from only eating beef.\nNew York Strip w/kalbi marinade, kim chee, pickled sprouts- I added foie gras (addt. $20- before it gets banned!!) which was a good sized piece. However, since part of the foie was thicker, one half was a bit overcooked. The NY was cooked a perfect medium rare, but I'm still undecided on how well the kalbi marinade w/kim chee worked, despite this being my server's favorite dish. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nDessert- \nTriple Chocolate Mousse w/strawberries, irish cream, hazelnut- GET THIS DESSERT, it was sooooo good. Way better than the pistachio cake, unless you don't like chocolate. \nPistachio Cake w/thai tea, coconut, honey tuile- A bit drier than I would have liked, the honey tuile was probably my favorite component on this dish.\n\nSince we were early for the reservation, we actually started off the bar, where they still have happy hour specials on the weekends! We ordered a $5 glass of red wine and 2 hamachi shooters for $5- even though we were seated almost right after we ordered, the bar staff was nice enough to bring our items to the table, and they only charged us for the HH prices. \n\nOverall, I would say 5A5 is a place to go if you feel like spurlging a bit for a nice steak dinner. The service and atmosphere are way better than the normal steak joints like Ruth's Chris and Harris', for the same prices. I will definitely be back for another HH, and to try the wagyu one day!", "author": "Amy D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-17", "description": "MMmm Wagyu...\n\nI have a deep embarrassing secret to get off my chest.  With all my yelping and all my constant food consumption, you would think I would have somewhat of a refined palate.  Well, I Jacquelynne, am a foodie impostor.  I am not a fan of: caviar, foie gras, liver in general, and lamb (lamb due a traumatic childhood experience that I'll get into some other day).  Regardless, my palate refuses me to indulge in the finer, more lavishing splendors in life.  I am merely just a yellow belt in gluttony.  I barely started ordering \"medium\" this past year because I was so freaked out by bloody meat growing up.  Maybe one day I'll have the courage to finish a medium-rare steak.  Baby steps...\n\nWith that being said, I JUST discovered Wagyu (26 year LATE, I know).  Boy was it a swell discovery of mine.  I guess it's better late than never.\n\nMoving on, here's my lovely night in a nutshell:\n\nShooters:\nHamachi Shooter (avocado, ginger, yuzu tobiko, ponzu) $4\nOyster Shooter (compressed watermelon, thai sauce) $4\n\nAgain on my rant of my lack of refined dining.  I started appreciating oysters 5 months ago.  I tried oysters twice as a kid and I threw up both times because of the taste and smell, since then I stayed away from it.  However, I gained the confidence to try it 15 years later and since my rediscovery, I've been all about it.  I can tell that they use the freshest seafood for it doesn't have a stale-like taste.  I actually enjoyed the hamachi the most.  \n\nStarters:\nBacon wrapped scallops.  $16\n\nFunny thing, it's not on the online menu and it wasn't on my date's menu.  However, it was in my menu and our waitress actually recommended it because we couldn't decide.  I was a bit hesitant at first because I thought it would be too heavy of a starter, but it actually was just right.  It was perfectly seasoned and it had a soft center with a slight crunch to it because of the bacon.\n\nMain:\nBone-in ribeye (roasted red onion, aged balsamic demi glace 25oz) $44\nWagyu -- Cabassi & rea ribeye (sweet garlic puree 4 oz) $76\n\nLet's start with the ribeye, it was so huge I wasn't able to finish it.  We managed to wrap half of it to go.  The aged balsamic dressing blended perfectly with meat.   It was by far one of the best steak dishes I've had thus far, super juicy and the sauce...oh the sauce.  *Disclaimer: it's the slowest cooked dish in the menu, even the waiter will warn you that it is a 35 minute wait.\n\nNow the wagyu, my first bite of heaven.  My date originally wanted me to order this with him but I felt really guilty spending so much money on the meal.  I saw the prices of the wagyu and all of them ranged from $19-$22 per ounce.  Keep in mind you have a choice between 4-12 ounces.  I feel uncomfortable when people pay for my meal at pricey restaurants.  Unless, it was my boyfriend and it was our anniversary or something special.   Rather than raking up his bill, I decided to just stick to my cheaper dish and just take a bite or two from his plate.  BIG MISTAKE, that wagyu just melted in my mouth.  Talk about popping my steak cherry.  I've never had such amazing piece of meat.  Even with it being medium-rare (something I wouldn't order myself), I was in love with the taste and especially the texture.  \n\nSide:\nMac and cheese (Gruyere, mozzarella, cheddar) $9\n\nI can't really complain about mac and cheese especially when there's gruyere in it.  It went perfect with our steaks.  Also, unlike some reviews I've read, I didn't find our batch salty at all.\n\nDessert:\nCookies and Hot Chocolate $5\nCreme Brulee $9\n\nBoth were good, props to the pastry chef.  I prefer the cookies and hot chocolate for the creme brulee was a little too rich for me.  However, my date loved the creme brulee.  To each their own.\n\n\nService:\nOur waitress was perfect.  Very attentive, very informative and not super annoying to the point where she would ask to fill our water glasses every 10 minutes.   I also noticed that when we went, most of the waiters were super attractive.  I felt like I was in a diner in LA where all the reject-aspiring models/actors worked at.  \n\nAmbiance: \nWOW.  The entire place was beautiful.  The chairs and tables were very chic.  The ceiling and light fixtures made our dinner extra special.  Also, unlike a lot of steak restaurants, I like how they didn't bring out those ugly serrated steak knives (even places like Ruth Chris' had that).  The dishes and silverware were all very modern and went well with sleek look of the restaurant. \n\n+4.5, it's definitely not your typical dark, depressingly decorated steakhouse.  The food is exceptional and the service is on point.  Personally I wouldn't spend this much money on dinner but feel free to take me here if it's on you...just don't expect anything back except a wink and a smile", "author": "Jacquelynne S."}

The service and most of the food was absolutely fantastic.  Definitely no complaints there.  Things took a turn for the worse when the steak came.\n\nI ordered a 10oz filet mignon, medium rare.  It was slightly overcooked (not that big of a deal for me), but the big sin was that it was completely dry, the outside was rubbery, and it had almost zero taste.  Really unfortunate. \n\nI also had a side of brussel sprouts, which I also didn't care for, but that may just be a taste preference.  I typically love brussel sprouts, but these had an almost overpowering lemon flavor to them that I didn't care for at all. \n\nMy partner who, bless her, doesn't eat beef but took me to a steakhouse for my birthday anyway, got the chicken.  Hers was dry and unseasoned as well and she didn't bother to finish it. \n\nI'm not sure what to think honestly.  The service was fantastic, and the small bites tasty, but how do you mess up so terribly on the meat?  My only thought is that, because they offer much higher quality (and more expensive) options, that they don't spend as much time or care on the \"lesser\" meats.  \n\nAll that's to say that, while certainly not the worst steak I've ever had, it was likely the worst filet mignon I've ever had.  Completely inexcusable from a steakhouse,  no matter the quality service.", "author": "Kevin M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-14", "description": "Another complete and total wow. 5A5 definitely gives you the five star experience, no doubt about it. Is it pricey? Yes it is. Is it worth it? Worth every single penny spent!\n\nLast Tuesday I was the vegetarian at the steakhouse as I had promised (to myself) that I would take le boyfriend to a steakhouse. He loves steak, I love him, so that's how stuff works. Anyway, being the vegetarian at a steakhouse definitely has it's benefits for your wallet and with flavour and luxury you're not missing out on anything at 5A5.\n\nIt started off with a complimentary tasting of the day's soup (carrot-ginger) and our chosen starter, the truffle fries with srirracha a\u00efoli. Now, we usually hate ginger, but this soup was delicious! The ginger did not overpower the flavour but enhanced it, the way ginger should, but for us so rarely does. The chips and a\u00efoli were okay for me, but le boyfriend loved how crunchy they were without being very dark in colour. They were indeed a nice golden yellow and crunchy, but these chips were cut thick enough that they should have a fluffy centre which they didn't have. For me, that's what I look for in anything that's cut thicker than French or shoestring. As for the a\u00efoli, le boyfriend could detect the heat from the srirracha, I couldn't. So if it's spicy you're expecting, lower your expectations. But if it's tasty that your looking for, keep your expectations right where they are and the food (all the food) at 5A5 will live up to them.\n\nNext came a palate cleanser between the starter and the main, it was slightly sweet and other than that had no flavour. Definitely an appropriate palate cleanser!\n\nNow the main. I had ordered the heirloom tomato salad that comes with burrata, balsamic, crispy shallots and a champagne vinaigrette. Le boyfriend had the tajima f1 filet (wagyu/holstein crossbreed) with shimeji mushrooms and a demi glace. As a side we shared the truffle mac&cheese. Like I said before, as a vegetarian you do not miss out on the flavour or experience at 5A5. The heirloom tomato salad was fresh and delicious but in my opinion doesn't need the crispy shallots. The mac&cheese was nice and comforting, though for me the flavour of truffle is something that takes my palate a bite or two to adjust to. Once adjusted, definitely delicious, but who really can resist warm and cheesy pasta??\nNow, for the main event: the steak! Le boyfriend ordered it rare and it was cooked to perfection. Good thing, because le boyfriend has high standards when it comes to the rarity of his meat. Especially since one of my vegetarian talents is that I cook the perfect steak. (My other two vegetarian talents are cooking fish to perfection and being able to fillet said fish.) Anyway, back to 5A5's steak. Le boyfriend said it was hands down the best piece of meat he has ever tasted. He couldn't quite explain the texture to my vegetarian brain, but apparently it is awesomely melt-in-your-mouth soft. Also, something about angels pooping on tongues, but that seemed like a less accurate description.\n\nThen for dessert I had the winter cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and le boyfriend had the warm chocolate fondant cake. The winter cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was an arrangement of mint cr\u00e8me on a chocolate (brownie?) base, with a chocolate tuille as the \"crunch\", a mint ice cream that had crunchy chocolate balls as the chips, a brownie bit and chocolate-rum ice cream. The mint tasted like natural mint, not gum or toothpaste, the brownie bit was deliciously fudgy and I loved the texture of the crunchy chocolate balls in the mint ice cream. The chocolate tuille did not add that signature br\u00fbl\u00e9e crunch for me, but it went well with the dish which in no means was to be taken literally as a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. As for the chocolate-rum ice cream, I could have sworn it was Ardbeg (a smoky type of Scotch Whisky) but le boyfriend mentioned that the menu spoke of rum. As it tasted like Ardbeg to me, I'm not a fan, but I see the appeal in having the smoky flavour there. As for the warm fondant, it was warm&gooey in the centre and the toffee glass and coffee ice cream that came with it were delicious! Definitely a great dessert.\n\nNow for the kicker. Throughout the night we had chatted with our server, Ryan, who had asked why we had come out to San Francisco this time. We had answered that we had come to celebrate Christmas and our seven year anniversary two weeks prior. What did Ryan do? He had a special plate come out with \"Happy anniversary\" piped out in chocolate and two lovely little palmiers and two pieces of g\u00e2teau op\u00e9ra. Now I assume that the person who piped it does that on a regular basis but still, that's a lot of effort put into a complimentary gift!\n\nThe night ended with a Turkish delight & Madeleine with our bill and me wanting to hug Ryan for the lovely gesture of the anniversary plate. With the flavour of everything, the attentive service and all the complimentary food you definitely get your money's worth when eating at 5A5!", "author": "Bekkah R."}

A friend suggested I try 5A5, and not only was I glad that I did, but so was my entire group.\n\nI worked with James Healy to secure the space at the restaurant. We were able to get a private room for our group, and I pre-selected our wines, and a fixed menu.  \n\nWhen I got to the restaurant, I was pleased with the bar/lounge area, dining area, and the private room.  The restrooms are downstairs just outside of the private room.   It's a common area with private mini bathrooms for privacy, but there are both mens and womens mini rooms with an island of sinks separating each side. It's a very unique and interesting setup.  \n\nFor $75 per person, our fixed menu was incredibly delicious, and we had a wonderful team of attentive servers.\n\n1st Course was the Hamachi shooter, and the Maguro Shooter.  I've never had, or heard of either one, but I can tell you that they were both good.  Im a total avocado junkie, so I thought I might like the Hamachi better, but my taste buds were treated to a much pleasant surprise with the Maguro Shooter. It just had a bit more flavor with a slight zip to it. \n\n2nd course was either soup or Salad. Of course, I chose the Caesar salad\n\n3rd Course was a choice of either Filet Mignon, Strip Steak, Chicken, or Seabass.  I don't think anyone ordered the chicken. I ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare.  It had a tarragon beurre fondue on it (sorry, I don't know what that really is, but I can tell you that it was flavorful). The steak was cooked nicely, and I just didn't want dinner to end.  Each meal was served with green beans and a creamy mashed potato. \n\nSeabass was cooked just right and the outside had a thin golden crisp .\nStrip Steak seemed to also be a favorite, as I heard others raving about how good it tasted.\n\nWe finished the final course with a wonderful dessert.\n\nI'd love to go back for another group event. The only thing that I could see changing is that our servers continued to serve wine throughout the meal. The wine was good, and the servers were great.  However, I can see someone not realizing they are getting a constant refill on the wine, and drinking more than they should.  This wouldn't be good if you plan on driving home.   This is just something that I will know to bring attention to next time.  I'll ask the servers to check with the guest before refilling a glass.  Otherwise, I really couldn't ask for anything more.

Truffle fries were ok, lots of small pieces and it was pretty crispy... we told our server that we think we over ordered and if he can cancel the Mac and cheese and he said he will try, so he didn't. I watched him for the next 5-10 mins to see if he would talk to the kitchen or manager and he simply chose to let the Mac and cheese come out and had the nerve to say oh looks like it came out. Overall mashed potatoes were good and the bone in ribeye is enough to share with another person which he also failed to mention knowing we ordered all that for two. Will I go here again?

The food is great - they make their steaks impeccably, and the sides are also sumptuous and fairly-sized. Their whiskey selection is also good, including Taketsuru 21-year-old, which is not an easy thing to find these days.\n\nThe one thing I will hate upon is the fact that they force you to look at their rack of Wagyu beef EVERY SINGLE TIME and force it in your face, and talk about it for 5 minutes straight. Dude, if I wanted the wagyu I'd ask for the wagyu. They also obfuscate the pricing a lot on it - ie, it's priced per ounce, then they only sell 4 to 8 ounces. This may be standard for the industry, but it is somewhat a tricky way to get a drunk/faux-baller type to spend more than they intend to. \n\nThe 'normal' steaks are also fantastic and so is the service. I just have to dock a point for over-sale.\n\nIf you're just getting drinks in the bar too, it's actually a really pleasant place to get them. Again, great service.", "author": "Ed Z."}

They knew we were celebrating so everyone greeted us with a \"happy birthday!\"  They sure know how to make a girl feel special lol!  The service was on point. I don't know who our server was but she did a spectacular job.  She was attentive but gave us enough space enjoy our dinner.\n\nNow lets get to the real stuff - the food.  The sides were amazing. I really enjoyed the oyster bites.  The oyster bites were tender and had a well balanced flavor that made you go WOW when you ate it.  The wagyu bite wasn't as enjoyable.  I thought it lacked flavor and the texture was eh.  I'm used to tartare being completely raw and it seemed partially cooked. Definitely not worth the $12 to be completely honest.  We also absolutely loved the champagne leek and potato soup. Holy shiza it was good! Get it!  There's caviar and lightly fries oysters in it (unique take on the soup); who wouldn't want that?  When it came to the steak, I was less impressed.  I got the dry aged bone in ny steak which came with a bacon jam and poached egg.  The bacon jam was a complete overkill and I ended up scraping that whole thing off.  My steak was also super dry when I asked for it medium rare. Oh well.  Desserts were beautiful and tasted delicious.  I would recommend it, but definitely want to try a different kind of meat next time (maybe the lamb).", "author": "Kenitha Y."}

We have been here a couple of times and alway had such wonderful experiences!   From the get go, i worked with James Healy to set up dinner in a private room.  James was very accommodating and responded quickly to my emails.  On the night of dinner, the service was great and the food was delicious! Our server Ashley was very nice, attentive and provided a seamless and enjoyable experience for all!  With a big group, we had to choose the 4 course preset menu.  I had originally wanted to order off the regular menu but this was easier for the chef.   Started off with the Hamachi & Maguro Bites.  Everyone loved the Hamachi over the Maguro bites.  Our 2nd course was a Caesar Salad or Oyster Bisque.  My bisque had one oyster but the B-day boy lucked out with 4 oysters in his soup!  Lucky him!  The Bisque was very flavorful which i liked.  For our entree, he had the Seabass which was very flaky and I had Strip Steak- tender and good.  I don't remember much about dessert but they did bring out a B-day dessert.

The pink lychee martini was nice and strong, although light on the lychee.  (As noted in my first review, the bar was half-closed for a private event, so we bounced to grab Happy Hour drinks elsewhere - sadness, no oyster/hamachi shooters and champagne!)\n\nThe bacon bread to start off was pretty good.  The appetizers were just salads - obviously not what we came here for.  My romaine hearts salad was drenched in Caesar's dressing, although the small anchovies were a nice touch.  We also added a pair of sides, and truffled mac-and-cheese and marble potatoes almost stole the show - both were delicious and served hot in cute mini iron skillets.  The entree choices were an 8oz NY or 12 oz ribeye.  My ribeye was very tender and juicey and seasoned well.  The server honored my prissy request to have the chef cut the steak up for me (Lunar New Year - no knives allowed.  Yes, I'm a FOB.)  The pistachio sponge cake dessert lacked a strong pistachio flavor, so it was merely a sponge cake to me.  The triple chocolate cake would be great for a chocolate lover - just too much for me.\n\nOverall, my recommendation would be to skip limited Prix-fixe meal and just order the steaks, sides, and whatever else you'd like instead (oyster/hamachi shooters - get them).", "author": "Kevin W."}

Meat and presentation is top-notch but some of its appetizers and desserts weren't quite as marvelous. \n\nHamachi shooter was great but a bit sour and acidic; too bad the deliciousness dissipates in ten seconds. Kobe sliders were good, if you want some meat but don't want to lay down fourty or fifty bucks on the table, this is perfect and it comes with fries (not to be mistaken with the truffle fries). Had the mushrooms, spinach, and gruyere mac and cheese. The mushrooms and spinach was in no way extraordinary; just needed some veggies to counter the fat-laden dinner. The mac and cheese was great, small portion and looks like the ones you can microwave except it tastes roughly eight times better (more or less). Oh man and then there was the truffle fries.. let me bask in the moment... ... ... \nIt. Was. Delicious. Definitely a must, the sriracha aioli was so good! \n\nAs for the main dishes, they were pretty colossal. The 10oz prime rib looked more like 14oz, but I'm not complaining, I'm just stating my observations. A bit on the saltier side but nothing that will ruin your dinner. The seabass, although not stated, is actually chilean. Was not nearly as delicious as the steaks but it was a good alternative. The boneless short ribs were embarrassingly small. If I had to guess, it was about 5oz. In contrast to the 10oz prime rib and 25oz ribeye, it was just plain sad. Don't get me wrong, it was tender beyond anything but I came to have dinner, not a 2 minute snack. The ribeye was my favorite of all, it was huge and it was marinated throughout and thoroughly pleasing. \n\nNothing on the dessert menu excited me. I liked the earl grey panna cotta because it was light in sweetness; found it bizarre that it was cut in strips... reminded me very much of a firm tofu. The fried cheesecake was basically a dessert version of a mozzarella stick, no thanks. The carrot cake was tasty and moist. For me, my favorite part of a carrot cake is the super sweet icing on the top but this place replaced it with something much less sweet. Why would you do that!!!  Oh well.\n\nThe bottom line: it's a steakhouse, if it isn't immediately obvious, get the steak... and truffle fries. :)", "author": "Ryan L."}

When I'm paying $55 for a bone in rib eye steak (actually $75 when you add in tax, tip, and city health tax) I expect a little better quality then the reject steaks from Sizzler (my apologies to Sizzler)!  However when the Assistant Manager came over to ask us how everything was I showed her how gristly my steak was and  when I even demonstrated to her how impossible it was to cut she was SO VERY helpful.....she gave me another steak knife to try!!!!  I'm not kidding!  A chainsaw would have been more useful.\n\nAnd the service also sucked.  We had ordered a soup and a salad.  After the other members of our party had already gotten theirs we patently waited for ours to show up.  However it wasn't until our fellow diners were finishing up their first courses that we finally reminded the waiter that we hadn't received ours yet .  Opps!  I guess someone screwed up (he blamed the kitchen).  This definitely is not up to the standard that a steak house of this supposed caliber should be exhibiting.

The temperature was perfect. However, I thought it was a little salty for my taste.\n* Filet mignon: 5/5- This was my boyfriend's dish. I tried a bit of it and it melted in my mouth!\n* WAYGU: 100/5!!! SERIOUSLY. I got it in 4 oz. Although it was $108, it was definitely worth every penny. The butter they put on top of the waygu went with the meat. The meat was so soft that you don't even need a knife to cut it. The butter and meat also melts in your mouth! Definitely a MUST TRY if this is your first time here.\n* Truffle fries: 5/5- You can taste the truffle oil and it was so mouthwatering.\n* Marble potatoes: 5/5- I thought it was cute how these potatoes were the mini ones. It came with bacon bits and sour cream\n* Chocolate fondant (dessert): 5/5- This was the waitress recommendation. The chocolate was very smooth and it had a taste of banana in there. I normally don't like the taste of banana.. but this was an absolute perfection!\n\nThe sweet waitress gave my boyfriend and I Hamachi shooters on the house because the steaks were taking a while for it to come out. She kept on apologizing and I thought that was very considerate of her. I felt bad even though it was definitely not her fault the cooks are taking their time with our steak. She also knew this was my boyfriend's birthday and gave him a complimentary dessert on the house!\n\nEven though I paid arm and leg for dinner service, I would come back in a heartbeat to try other things on the menu.

Happy hour covers $5 wines, cocktails, beers and appetizers which is a pretty good deal. Drinks and conversations are often accompanied by truffle fries, oysters, and hamachi shooters for us. \n\nBut back to dinner. At $12 an ounce, my Wagyu was pricey for the few bites I had but wow did it just melt like butter in my mouth. I've never had steak quite like that before. Paired with some truffled mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and sauteed Swiss chard, it was a decadent meal paired with great wine. Other dishes are pretty decent too. I've had a sashimi starter and the fillet mignon here and while good, both pale in comparison to the Wagyu. \n\n5A5 is still rough around the edges though. While service is friendly and attentive, it can be slow. There was a night when we came in a fairly large group. Some of us ordered shooters as starters, others ordered from the bites, and others salad. The food came out staggered versus all at once as starters which was awkward when at any one time, only 2-3 people on the table had food and the rest looking on. Dinner that night was long! \n\nStill 5A5 is a decent dining spot. For a contemporary steakhouse, it holds it's ground against legendary San Francisco steakhouse luminaries.", "author": "Jon L."}

Steak and prime-rib are almost always good to me, and I didn't leave this place unsatisfied.  Overall, I would say the food is not great, but good.\n\nIt was obviously crowded for DAT.  As for the lounge at night, sometimes the place is packed (and stuffy) and other times it is dead.\n\nIt wasn't dead the night we met last March. No one wanted to dance with me when they played my jam, 2012's best song, \"Talk That Talk\".  I walked outside to be interrogated and bombarded with questions that perhaps only an HR employee could ask. She says I have the big nose but she was the one being nosey that night. \n\nAfter being shocked at my never having been in a relationship before, and insisting that I had little interest in one, she curiously asked \"if the right girl came along, would you?\". I said I didn't know.\n\nOn June 29th, that question was answered with a yes. \n\nAnd exactly 11 months later, here I am, doing what I thought I'd never do. Yelp.\n\nShe has gotten me to Yelp and go to restaurants I would never have imagined going.\n\nNow if only I could get her to go zip-lining with me.", "author": "Eric W."}

I live in the area so talked to a few people who said this was the place to have the dinner for 12. My friend called the manager several times to set up this surprise dinner.  He mentioned that we had a vegan in the group and wanted to know what the options were. He was given a pretty extensive list and we were satisfied that we had made the right choice.  We were told the corkage fee was $25 and that was fine.  Several of us brought nice bottles of wine to celebrate.\n    Everyone arrived and we were seated in our private dining room.  We were all having a good time, but we kept waiting for our server who took forever to appear.  Suddenly, the menu that had been discussed before hand for the vegan was no longer available.  The corkage fee had also risen to $50, which we did not find out till we recieved the bill.  We asked for the manager over the vegan menu and he did come and apologize but the evening seemed to go down hill from there.   The waiter was mostly absent.  The vegan options were very downsized from what had been promised.  The food was mediocre at best, not worth the prices.  The waiter made a mistake with the bill , when they were specifically asked for separate checks for 6 couples and when we tried to get them to fix it, he would not come back, we had to look for him and finally get the manager.  At that point, I was too tired to argue over the corkage fee that I had been lied to over the phone about.  We were really just glad to get out of there.  The problem is when you plan ahead, months at a time, and when you get there, nothing was as planned, it makes you very upset.  I dont care how good the other reviews are, we wont be back and am really sorry we chose this place to celebrate a special occasion.", "author": "Cassy H."}

He brought out their show case of meats but never explain any of it to us. Overall, he wasn't around much, and we waited so long for just a soda. Our main entree took a VERY long time, meanwhile I see a table across from me already eating their main course having arrived way after us. When our dinner did arrived, my husband's steak was COLD! That was so ridiculous. I told my husband to send it back but we were so hungry and have had to wait so long already, his stomach couldn't afford to wait any longer. Plus, we just hate being those annoying patrons that \"complains.\" I just felt so bad for my husband having such an experience on his bday, especially when our waiter continued to be M.I.A. knowing that we came to celebrate a birthday. I just had to say something to someone. The manager was nice enough to come by our table and expressed his apology to my husband, which was very comforting, we appreciated that.

It was brown on the inside, which is pretty off the mark. I sent it back, and got my next steak, which was rare. :/  Cold on the inside, but I ate it anyway because the person I was with had almost finished their dish. The very kind management offered me a free dessert to compensate, which was nice because I didn't ask for anything.\n\nThe pluses: Relaxed and casual environment with high-end food. Steak and sushi, so something for everyone. Range of food, from 30 dollar dishes - 400 dollar steaks. Wagyu beef is something like $160/ 4 ounces. It looks amazing -- super marbled. I enjoyed the cocktails. $11 for a range of cocktails, which I think is very fair for a nice steakhouse. There is an extensive wine list, as well. The heirloom tomato salad I had before the steak was very light and flavorful. The homemade cheese was amazing.\n\nThe minuses: Steak is a la carte- not unusual for a steakhouse, but it would be nice to have at least a small salad. The 8oz filet was around $50, but that is the a la carte price. The mac n cheese that they push, is very very cheesy and heavy. Might not be the best side if you want to keep it light. \n\nJust a note, the food arrived about an hour after we sat down. This is at 6:00pm, when the restaurant was not busy. So, give yourself some time if planning on eating here. \n\nOverall, I would love to come back and eat here again. I am not dying to come back and try anything in particular like I would be at some other restaurants.", "author": "Aeri S."}

There seemed to be a lot of people dining there with the same promo. \n\nThe dishes ordered:\n\nAPPETIZERS:\nHamachi Shots - flavorful but didn't overpower the hamachi taste. The shot considered of what seems to be the typical flavors of green onion, ponzu and avocado.\nOyster Shots - I liked the hamachi shots much better. You get the Oyster taste and texture but it was nothing special.\nTruffle fries - thick cut fries that weren't too greasy. The top portion of fries had the  strong truffle oil taste but once you get through the top fries, it started taste like plain fries. The dipping sauce was good.\n\n\nMAIN:\nFilet Mignon cooked Medium Rare - this was not cooked medium rare. It was overcooked and some bites were way too chewy. Some of the edges of my meat were even charred! The sauces were good but if the meat isn't cooked properly...it is ruined. \nBone-in Ribeye - HUGE piece of meat. Similarly to my Filet Mignon, it wasn't cooked properly and parts of the meat were charred. By the time my boyfriend was full, there was still plenty of meat on the plate but it wasn't worth taking it home with the meat already dry.\n\nSIDES: \nBaked Mac n Cheese - this side and the dessert is what made this dining experience enjoyable. The Mac n Cheese was cooked perfectly and served in a cute pan. You can really smell and taste the different cheeses. \n\nDESSERT: \n7 Degrees of Chocolate - a must for chocolate lovers. 7 types of chocolates served  together on a plate. I can't recall each exact chocolate but the green tea was my favorite. The plating was nicely done (see photo). \n\nOverall the dining experience did not meet my expectations for the price.

Somehow, fate maybe, my schedule paved room for us to confirm the 8th reservation and following through with the plan. \n\nI had carefully read through the reviews and studied the menu. Looked through their wine list and decided that it was better to bring our own bottle and pay for the corkage fee. Jimmy had purchased a beautiful Malbec and he's been dying to try it. \n\nOur waitress was very nice to carefully go through the menu with us and recommending a dish from each section (shooters, appetizers, soup/salad, entree, waygu, sides and desserts) after we told her that it was our first time at 5A5. \n\nFor shooters: \n-Hamachi: avocado, ginger, yuzu tobiko, ponzu \n\nOur waitress had recommended this shooter and we decided to try it. Very refreshing and it opened up our appetite for the dishes to come. \n\nFor appetizer: \n-Truffle fries \n-Tuna tartare \n\nAs recommended by many yelpers, we ordered the truffle fries. I'm disappointed to say, I didn't like the fries very much. The slices were too big of a cut for me, and although the skin was crispy and well seasoned I prefer my fries to be thin so that it's less starchy to taste. The tuna tartare was (to me) below mediocre. Not only was it and very bland, they mixed chunks of tuna with carrots or beets so I felt cheated with the dish. The dish may look decent in size but what percent of it is actually tuna? Yo no s\u00e9. \n\nFor wagyu: \n-Cabassi & rea ribcap \n\nHow could you NOT order wagyu at a restaurant that serves it, right? For $19 per oz, we shared the 4 oz ribcap ($76). The chef recommends we get it medium so medium was what we ordered. The best dish I had for the evening. Although we had it cooked medium, its texture tastes as if it was rare. It was so soft, so tender and so juicy that I could cut  into the meat without using a knife. \n\nFor entree: \n-Dry aged t-bone (added a seared foie gras for an additional $20) \n-Dry aged bone-in ny \n\nThe dry aged bone-in ny was very concentrated in flavor. I was very happy that I had chose it as my entree. I loved every single bite of it and was in bliss with every sip of wine to pair. Had it cooked rare and it came out exactly how I like my steak. Jimmy's t-bone was tasty as well but his foie gras was dull and lacked flavor.  The only complaint about our steaks is that it was a little bit too salty. \n\nFor dessert: \n-7 degree of chocolate \n\nA very rich and heavenly dessert. 7 drops of chocolate infused with flavors such as green tea, hazelnut and other sweet indulgence. Everyone around us had ordered it and out waitress strongly recommended it. It was a delightful ending to our dinner. \n\nIf we had skipped out on the appetizers then I would have given 4-stars, other than that, the waygu and steaks were delicious!", "author": "Jenny K."}

Then we moved on to the mizuna salad, which is served in this long rectangular plate (nice touch), but is not just about the presentation. Delicate greens, truffle oil, orange/tangerines and oddly enough, rice krispies w/nori.

The food is always consistently delicious, the staff is courteous and professional, and the atmosphere is always classy and lively at the same time. Whether you're here for a date for two, or a big party of 50, 5A5 has it set for you. \n\nSome of my favorite dishes (aside from the steak: prime rib, filet mignon, wagyu) include the hamachi shooters (delish!!), mizuna salad, truffle fries (yes, even the fries can taste like bomb), and ALL of the desserts. Oh, and shall I add that you MUST get the mac n cheese as a side dish? Super delicious! \n\nLounge wise, 5A5 is usually pretty poppin' and busy on weekend nights. Really nice to go to by default because there's no cover charge, but there is a guest list, which is easy to figure out how to get on. The drinks are always good (lychee matini, my favorite!), as well as the music. Most of the time, you'll run into someone you know to catch up with, or great to meet new friends as well. And may I mention that it's great for hosting birthday parties (dinner AND after-hours) as well? The staff is very accomodating to finding something that'll fit your needs and budget, and you're bound to have a great time! \nParking may be hard to find at times, but I've always been able to find something on the streets nearby =)", "author": "Louisa L."}

It was a Saturday night so they were busy and we didn't make a reservation but the wonderful host got us a table anyways! His birthday was the day before mine! (haha)\n\nThe wine list here is amazing! So many to choose from! \n\nWe had the wagyo shooters for an appetizer which were amazing! They are served on a spoon with a quail egg on top. My friend was a little nervous about eating the raw quail egg but it mixed all together really wonderfully in your mouth! The lobster tempura is to die for! \n\nOur waiter was extremely informative and very sweet. They bring out the cuts of wagyu to show you the different marbling in each one and he explains what wagyu is and how it's much different from your regular beef. He also explains how the other cuts of meat(the non-wagyu) are aged and such.\n\nHe told us what the most ordered and best dishes were. \n\nWe ordered ribeye wagyu 8oz, I wish I would of ordered the 4 oz because it's so delicious but it's a very RICH piece of meat. We had saut\u00e9ed swiss chard, potatoes, truffle mac & cheese, and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms for our side dishes. My favorite was the mac & cheese which you can add lobster to for an additional cost. \n\nFor dessert we had the southern decadence. It was like a sundae with rye on the bottom and the ice cream was tobacco ice cream! It was really good and pretty crazy tasting!\n\nSince the host knew it was my birthday he sent me a strawberry shortcake with a candle on top. I was asking my friends if they asked for it to be sent and they all said no. So we all realized it was the host!! HOW SWEET! \n\nThis is a fancy place but I have been in it dressed in jeans and a tee shirt as well as been dressed very fancy and the staff doesn't treat you any differently! They are extremely wonderful and nice people and very knowledgable and attentive.\n\nI highly recommend to try this restaurant at least once when you're in San Francisco!", "author": "Katrina M."}

We arrived and were seated by the bar and piano until our table was ready. We sat near the kitchen, in which I got to take a glimpse. Our server did his job, but service wasn't exceptional like I expected since it was a pretty well-known high-end place. I do want to return to try the waygu beef sampler which costs $525 .. when I'm ballin' lol. We started off with complimentary egg soup, which was served in with the cutest wooden spoon! It was very tasty, but a may be a little too salty. We then ordered the hamachi shooters which were good and their soup of the day, which was this bean soup - and I must say, don't order it if it's that bean soup! It tasted like a bunch of beans mashed up that you put into a taco, too heavy and just not worth it here. We also had the iceberg salad, which we replaced the goat cheese with parmesan. The lettuce was served without being cut, which was very different from how I eat salad, but was interesting. All I could think about was how they washed it so clean when it was not broken apart lol. We then got served a raspberry palette cleaner, which was a small spoonful, and it cleaned our tastebuds to ready us for our main course. I had the prime rib and my boyfriend had the steak, and I definitely liked the prime rib better - so much flavor :D ! One of my favorite dishes was the brussel sprouts dish, which was pretty vinegary, but I liked it a lot! I was given a chocolate cake for my birthday dessert which was too sweet for me. We also had a complimentary smores dessert from a friend of mine that works there and it was also a bit sweet, BUT the torched marshmallows were such good touches to eating the cake in one bite with the marshmallows.

We all ordered steaks and shared sides. I had the bone in aged NY steak. It came topped with a jelly relish and cooked egg. I liked the size of the cut. The first bite was bristle. The second bite...more bristle, not good. I expected tender..not even close and not worth the price paid for \"prime\" in a SF steak house venue. I was very disappointed with the relish topping and egg...but that's on me as it was described on the menu. I just didn't get what it was trying to accomplish. Server said break the yoke and spread it. What flavor the NY may have had was taken out of the equation by this odd combination of topping and egg. That aside, the bottom line for me was the poor quality of meat. Two others had the same steak and were also disappointed and left guessing as to what the relish and egg brought to the party. \nMoving on...another guest ordered the boneless rib eye. What he received was a glob of meat with a bone sticking straight up. It was a bizarre presentation. Like the NY..all show and no go as the quality of the meat was far less than what was advertised as a \"prime\" grade cut. \nThe sides were unimpressive. I took only a couple bites of the brussel sprouts. An odd flavor..not sure what was going on. The potato gratin was runny and lacked flavor. \nIn summary, a lot of money for poor quality meat trying to dress up with bizarre toppings and presentation.  \nAnd lastly...maybe salt in the wound, but for my preference the piano sound level was too loud for me. Not to take away from the guy's talent...very skilled.", "author": "Randall C."}

But I can't rate things on Yelp above a 5, so need to do the man justice here.\n\nI've been dying to go here since Yelp did the Elite event 2 years ago (back when I was an Elite and tooo slow to catch the email and got wait listed). That may have just motivated Wes a bit to be even more attentive, but the man didn't need to try! He nailed it, 150% with service. We had drinks, bread, appetizers and steak in such perfect succession and execution - no wait. He was smart enough to mention in advance it could take 20 minutes or so to cook the steak, because they sear it, then warm bake it to hold in the juices, then re-sear before they bring back out. But we didn't even notice if there was a wait...and well I ordered my steak so rare it probably really wouldn't have taken that long anyway.\n\nHad the French 75, followed by a dirty gin with extra olives. Boytoy stuck to vodka dirty with olives. Perfectly made, perfectly strong. We had a iceberg wedge salad to start, despite all the amazing temptations Wes conveyed to us, we were focused on not filling our stomachs too much to enjoy the meat portion.  I had the Bone-in ribeye, Zach had the dry cured Bone-in NY. Both were fantastic. I asked for mine as rare as you can get it and got it blue cool center. Perfection.\n\nPolished off with fried cheesecake bits and pineapple chutney (yum!). And while we Wes was settling our check, he called us a cab. It was like kissing your fingers at the end amazing, it was that smooth. \n\nHonestly, it felt like the stuff of dreams, like I was celebrating an anniversary or on my honeymoon. You just don't get this type of quality service and real finesse in waiting together often. And the place has a great atmosphere and flawless execution on cooking. I can see where some people would get into issues with the meat temperature and cooking, though, they really do get it rare when you ask for it.

I hesitated to take my boyfriend to Alexander's for his birthday despite the great steak reviews because some people had really bad experiences with snooty service.

I experienced that at a moderately high-end LA restaurant once! But here, I called a bit early to let them know I'd be late, and they held the table. Waiters don't judge you for how much or what you order (we opted for less than most people order I think) and they helpfully show you the 4 cuts of Wagyu meat.

We ate here tonight and its just now another overpriced eatery.  \n\nMany aspects of the 5A5 'experience' were gone tonight. The host did not ask to take our coats or make sure that our napkins matched our clothing.   There was no 'presentation' of the wagyu meats. There were no amuse bouche.  There were no palate cleansing surprises in the meal.  The wait staff was generally cold and unwelcoming.  There was nothing that made this restaurant special.  \n\nI actually asked if there was an owner or management change.   We also asked what happened to the meat presentation.  We were told that the chef asked that the meat briefing be replaced last night with a truffles shaving briefing which we also didn't get. \n\nI was hoping for a great holiday meal with special friends but I spent most of the night apologizing to them.  On top of it all, 3 out of 4 meat entrees weren't cooked correctly.  2 under cooked and 1 over cooked.  I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to spend more time in the restaurant.\n\nSome may point out that lower level of service is expected on 'B' nights like a Sunday.  I say that a restaurant shouldn't be open if it can't maintain every hour that they are open.\n\nI am going to leave my previous 5 Start review here to show how great this place used to be.\n\n===========================================\n\nThis is place is amazing. This is now my favorite restaurant.   \n\nTo start, this is a dining experience.  \n\nThe place is beautiful.  The dome covered main dining room with the 'lounge' feel makes you feel you are eating in a grand home.  Very comfortable and elegant with a modern feel.\n\nThe service is superb.  Every person from the host to the busboys has been expertly trained and shows that they care about their business and their customers.  You feel it as soon as you walk in.  \n\nWe started to go to 5A5 this August 2013 for our 8th anniversary.  I've been eyeing the menu for some time but felt that it was a tad overpriced.  I don't mind expensive as long as you are getting your money's worth.  With the recent SF restaurant prices increases partly fueled by the America's Cup and the second tech boom, the prices at 5A5 are now spot on for the experience.\n\nIn the nutshell, everything on the menu is wonderful.  There is a slight Asian fusion going on with the appetizers (which is a good thing) but their core competency is steak.  Phenomenal selection of items in varying price ranges.  We've tried almost everything not including (yet) the top kobe steaks.   I'll wait fo my retirement party in a few years.\n\nThe service is impeccable.  Friendly and very professional and consistent with each and every waiter.   What I find fascinating that anyone that brought something to the table was always well versed in explaining what was being served.  I almost would bet that the night janitors have to know the menu as well.   Its uncanny.\n\nThe meal is full of nice touches and surprises.  Won't spoil it for you.   Once... and just once... there was a problem with one of our steaks.   I am still shocked at how professionally and wonderfully the situation was handled.  \n\nI give it 5 stars.  I highly recommend.  We will go back again an again.", "author": "Victor P."}

I'm not a big fan of oysters, but I had no problems slurpin' these babies up. Truffle fries were the winner of the evening.

I live near New York City, so when it comes to steakhouses, I'm spoiled (Peter Luger, Spark's, Wolfgang's, Keens, etc., etc.); so my expectation level wasn't particularly high.  But the steaks are large, well prepared, and of high quality. Sides are traditional but with little creative twists, and also well prepared. Service is attentive.  No complaints at all.  Incidentally, if you want to get your host fired, they have Wagyu cuts, imported from Japan; a 12-ounce Wagyu ribeye will set you back a mere $545 (not a typo).

They are known for their steaks 5A5 grade which is supposed to be the highest grade for steaks (hence their restaurant name '5A5'). Our server was wonderful. Walked us through the different cuts of meat and explained how each one was marbleized, even brought out an example platter to really show us how it looked before we really chose. He even gave us a card of authenticity of the meat after we finished ordering. He suggested for us to try one of each grade of meat to really compare them. So that's what we did. We got a 4oz of the American NY steak, a 4oz of the F1 Australian NY steak, and a 4oz of the A5 Japanese NY steak. It doesn't sound like much especially with us sharing everything but the A5 steak is so fatty that it just makes you full after several bites! The American NY steak was underwhelming as expected and the F1 was better then finally the A5 was amazing. (But you can only eat so much before feeling sick since it's so fatty). We also got some appetizers, the waygu beef and the lobster tail tempura. The lobster tail tempura was great, it's actually a whole lobster tail that they lightly battered and fried. Really good. We kinda did a surf n turf with the lobster tail and steaks. Hahah. It's kind of on the expensive side but definitely worth the experience at least once.", "author": "Leslie Y."}

The haricot vert was very good, with a nice sauce & the salty feta paired with the crunch of pine nuts. I also liked the bacon mashed potatoes but appreciated the warning from another Yelper that they are sweet. I'll also agree with another Yelper who said that they have too much stuff on the steak.

The ambience was very romantic and the service was excellent. We were greeted and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated since they were packed. We waited at the bar. There was a pianist who played instrumental versions of current and old songs. We got seated and promptly greeted by our waitress. The table was filled with rose petals and candles. It was a nice touch! \n\nAs for the food, we went with their $110 per person. It comes with an appetizer, salad or soup, entree, and dessert. \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\n- Scallops with uni: This was one of my favorite dish of the night. It was delicious and fresh! \n\n-Hamachi carpaccio: They were thinly slices of hamachi with baby shrimp and various vegetables. It was okay. For the price we were paying, I would think the shrimp would be a little bigger but I guess it paired well with the sizes of everything else on the plate. \n\n-\"Ramen\" soup: The noodles were made with cuttlefish. It was good and simple.\n\n-Palette cleanser: compliments of the chef: it was a passionfruit light mousse. so good! \n\n- Filet Mignon: We both ordered it medium rare. It was perfectly cooked and tender. It was not over seasoned so you could really taste the quality of the meat. This was my second favorite dish of the night. \n\n- Dessert: Chocolate mousse with ice cream: It was delicious! I don't love chocolate but the richness was nicely paired with the freshness of the ice cream. I think it was some kind of passion fruit or lychee. \n\n- Drinks: I ordered a moscow mule and one of their house drinks. The moscow mule was okay. The cocktail was delicious! Wish I could remember what it was though. \n\nWhen we got our check, the waitress gave us a box of cookies to take home from the pastry chef and a single long stem rose!

We ordered 2 glasses of champagne ($5), 2 hamachi shooters ($5), beef skewers ($2), and truffle fries ($5). It seems like a lot of food but the only thing that was filling was the truffle fries. The hamachi shooters were delicious and fresh. I'd definitely order them again next time. The beef skewer was plain and not worth it even for $2. The truffle fries were delicious with its siracha aoili dipping sauce. They came out hot and perfectly fried: crispy on the outside, hot and fluffy on the inside. The truffle flavor was just right - not too overpowering but still there. I didn't taste the siracha in the sauce but it was still good. I'd highly recommend the fries because it's a HUGE portion - enough to feed 3 - 4 people! They did, however, get really salty after a while. \n\nWe were able to move our food to our dining table, which was nice. However, when we initially entered the restaurant earlier, they tried to sit us right next to the kitchen. Seriously, probably the worst table in the house. We decided to wait at the lounge until the \"other side\" opened up. The hostess assured us she would let us know when the tables opened up but, of course, she didn't and we had to approach her on our own. When she tried to sit us down at another table, we pointed out the table that we wanted to sit at and she kind of sighed and slowly moved the menus over. Not the best service - minus one stars for my overall review for this place. \n\nBut I digress. We decided to order the tuna tartare, an Australian F1 8oz, and the dry-aged bone-in ribeye with truffle butter and demiglaze. I've had better tuna tartare. It was served with chips but I prefered the dish without their accompaniment. The bone-in ribeye, as a warning, takes about 30-40 minutes to make. Since we already had a lot of food, it was nice to just relax and wait for our dishes to come. The bread they serve is interesting but not delicious in my opinion. The have a sweat bread and a bread with bacon chunks in it. I didn't like them much and kept munching on our fries instead. =)\n\nThe Australian F1 was a nice middle-man of filet and wagyu (more on the filet side). It had a nice, beefy taste to it while still maintaining a tender texture. The bone-in ribeye was MONSTROUS! I guess I didn't realize how full I was until it came out. I had about 3-4 bites and gave the rest to my friend. It was, however, extremely tender and delicious. If I hadn't eaten all those appetizers I would've definitely finished it. Both our steaks were cooked to a perfect medium rare, which was great because too many places mess up. I also like how they cut the steak so that when it's served to you, you can see that it's cooked perfectly to your request. \n\nFor dessert (yes, we're fatties and ordered dessert), we shared the 7 Degrees of Chocolate. It's supposed to showcase 7 different kinds of chocolate dessert but it's really only 5 major ones (the other 2 are \"chocolate dust\" and \"chocolate glass\" - basically chocolate powder and carmalized sugar). The mousse samples are very small but I thought it was the perfect amount... my favorite was the hazelnut mousse. My favorite part of the dish was the chocolate torte. It had a nice hard crust on the outside but when you opened it up, rich chocolate \"pudding\" oozed out. \n\nOur waiter was extremeley helpful, friendly, and funny. However, he was really busy throughout the night and rarely came over to check up on us. Our champagne glasses were empty for quite some time before he approached us to see if we wanted anything else. Overall, it wasn't him, it was just a busy night I suppose.\n\nThe restaurant itself is an interesting mix of lounge and steakhouse. The dining room is very small and the kitchen is right next to it. It was kind of creepy when the waiters would just peak out of the wall, staring at us customers. The bathroom is co-ed, which I don't really like. I also found it hard to figure out how to use the sink. Haha. \n\nIn the end, I'd definitely recommend this place for some good steak. I wouldn't say it's really pricey - pretty much the normal price for a steak (except for their wagyu). Too bad Japan banned the export of their Wagyu.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

When you walk into 5A5, it certainly feels more like a lounge than a restaurant. It's a very modern restaurant, with lots of rounded things and abstract shapes. It's fitting for the Financial district so no complaints here. \n\nMuch like many of you reading this review, we went searching on yelp for good appetizers, starters, and other suggestions that might steer us in the direction of the good noms. What we decided on sharing was the Truffle fries (Yes. If you don't like this, I will give you a check for $1 right now) and the Bacon wrapped scallops (Yes. Who questions bacon wrapped scallops???). \n\nBefore we jump into the Dine About Town menu, I just want to say, bacon bread. I will marry the first person I meet who knows how to make this. Woman, man, or machine. \n\nAnyways, so for my appetizer I had the Ceaser Romaine Hearts salad. Light, crispy with a nice dressing and sprinkled with chunks of bacon. Wait a second this was the third dish I had with Bacon in it...I think I have a problem. \n\nThe Filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare. I felt like it was a little under-seasoned, but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. I also stole a piece of NY Strip steak from a friend at the table. I felt that since this was a \"lesser\" cut of beef, there was a little more done here to help the steak along. I actually enjoyed this piece a little more than my Filet Mignon (*gasp*)! \n\nFinally, for dessert I ordered the Chocolate cremeux. For those of you wondering what a chocolate cremeux is, it's basically just the most french way to say creamy chocolate. Very rich, yet light and a great way to end the dinner. \n\nOverall, the waitstaff was fantastic, incredibly attentive, friendly and gave some good suggestions. They did forget to put something in that we ordered, but honestly it was a blessing in disguise as our enjoyment of the dinner would have likely turned into lament. This is a great place to bring a date and I would definitely plan on doing so in the future.

They served mini bites such as truffle fries and specialty happy your drinks.\n\nEventually, we were seated to our table which was located in the back next to an empty fish tank. \n\n*i wished we were seated in the middle where it was lit with beautiful lighting but i guess it was too busy. Also, they should fill that fish tank so that it can match the ambiance or something because sitting next to it made it feel like we were seated at the left over tables.\n\nAnyways, lets talk about the food.\n\nPalate:\nJapanese Custard - it wasn't custard but it had the texture as if it was custard. It had mushroom in it and i thought it was a bit salty.\n\nBread:\nBacon bread and sourdough bread. The bacon bread was really good.\n\nAppetizers:\n1. Daikon soup - it was pretty good. It was a tad bit salty but manageable. It felt like i need to compliment it by eating bread.\n2. Romaine Caesar Salad - it had anchovies. I'm not a big fan of anchovies but my bf loved it.\n\nPalate cleanser:\nlime shots was good and help cleanse the appetizers.\n\nEntrees:\n1.NY Steak strip marinaded with Kalbi, kimchee, and bean sprouts. It was ok. it was different but i wouldn't order it again.\n2. Ribeye steak: deserved majority of the stars! I loved how the steak was cooked to perfection and was really flavorful! Not just that, it was huge! It was drenched in peppercorn sauce and topped with shitake soft mushrooms. Beats Ruth Chris Steakhouse!\n\nSides:\n1.Truffled Mac & Cheese: eh, it was ok. It tasted like any other mac & cheese.\n2.Creamed Spinach: this was actually good. I'm not a fan of creamed spinach but this was really good. It wasn't watery or smushy. It had the right texture.\n\nDessert:\n1.Pistacio cake - i've never had any pistachio desserts other than ice cream..but this cake took it all! it was so good that i tasted the sweet pistachios! Love'd how the color complimented the nut! \n2. Triple Mousse cake - yum! it tasted good with the added condiments to the dessert. It was blended well.\n\nOverall, love the presentation, waitress who had a sense of humor, the ribeye, and desserts. \n\n\nnow the question is,\" would i come back?\"---yes.", "author": "Sarah F."}

But still, nice ambiance and environment. Typical financial area SF scene...hipsters, yuppies, and d-bags. But don't let that deter you. \n\nService was good, very attentive staff, polite, professional, etc.\n\nNow onto the food, (what really matters).\n\nStarted off with a few appetizers, the tako salad, kanpachi carpaccio, and lobster tempura. Each one was very good, however the lobster tempura was insanely good! I could have easily eaten two or three more orders by myself. Fantastic.\n\nFor the main course decided on the A5 Kobe Wagyu Ribeye. Wanted the Ribcap, but they were out. Oh well, next time. However the Ribeye did not disappoint on any level. Absolutely the best piece of beef I have ever eaten in my life, hands down! Worth EVERY cent of the $225 I paid for it!  One of the few things in life that lived up to all the hype I had heard and was truly mind blowing. It has ruined beef for me from now on, as nothing will ever compare.\n\nThe meal was a definite hit and I will absolutely be back again.

I am a harsh critic when it comes to steakhouses (lived in LA and have tried all of them near and far), but I have to admit, this one was one of the better ones I've ever been to. Their ambiance is trendy and modern, like I stepped out of a Crate and Barrel 2. We were seated promptly and quickly offered water...literally when my butt hit the seat--prompt service, I dig it. In regards to the menu, we ordered the following:\n\nTruffle fries: O.M.G. I am a potato lover, but but these fries with the Sriracha (my hometown is the location of Sriracha sauce!) aoili sauce is to die for, I could have used that sauce for friggin' anything. To balance all the saltiness, I had a Lychee Martini there. You know you've got a good drink going when the drink itself does not taste a bit of alcohol. \n\nPrime Rib: You know, I am not a fan of Prime Rib, but I have to admit, the basic garlic and butter sauce of their Prime Rib just made it melt in my mouth. 10 oz is no joke here...the portion was massive! My fiance looked over at my plate, comparing his child-size 8 oz NY steak (smothered with blue cheese, ick!). His steak was ok... my Prime Rib was amazing! I polished it off like nothing! \n\nMac & Cheese: Not the best I've eaten, but it was ooey and gooey, the way m&c should be.\n\nSauteed Spinach: There was something tart and off for this dish. I would not recommend. \n\nDessert: Triple threat plate. Need I say more? Even our neighboring table was oohing and ahhing when the dessert arrive. Was yummy, but too damn small of a portion. Could have had 3 more servings even with all the food we ate. \n\nOverall, good ambience, great service and tasty tasty food.

My dining partner ordered tap water with no ice. I asked for \"the same thing, please.\"  Mr. Waiterguy rolled his eyes and disappeared into the kitchen.  \n  \n7:40: a water delivery specialist (not our waiter) arrived with two glasses of water. Mine had ice. \n  \n7:45: Mr. Waiterguy reappeared and explained the menu to us.  He clearly knew the menu very well because he explained in the excruciating detail that even Rainman could appreciate. Then, without taking our food orders, he asked if he could take our drink orders. My dining partner ordered a cocktail and I asked what they had on tap. Waiterguy, seemingly annoyed that I would order a beer, explained to me that they don't have beer on tap. But, he did name some bottled beers.  I ordered an Amstel. He went away without taking our food order. \n  \n7:55: Mr. Waiterguy returned to explain that the bar was getting our drinks ready. How much work is it to pop a cap off a beer bottle? \n  \n8:05: No drinks and no sign of Waiterguy.  30+ minutes is too long to wait to put a food order in. So, we decided to leave.   \n\nThey weren't very packed; so, I assume that there must be some other reason why we weren't served.  Maybe Waiterguy wasn't an actual employee there? \n\nPros: \n   * The cryptic name, 5A5, gives it the kind of cred it needs to be dimly lit and staffed by snooty waiters.   Incidentally 5A5 as a hex number is 1,445 in base 10.  \n   * The tap water at 5A5 is pretty good. \n   * The decor is really nice. \n   * Based on the other reviews I've seen, the food must be pretty tasty.

I made a reservation for 8:45 pm. My family and I arrived at 8:30 pm and the hostess told me that our table was not yet ready, but that the group of diners had just paid their check. The hostess said that we would be seated in 15-20 mins.  I didn't mind since my family and I had arrived early.\n\nThirty minutes passed and still we were not seated. The hostess came up to me and told me that the table was winding up their conversation and that we would be seated shortly. At this point, I was getting irritated because I've been to other \"fine\" dining restaurants in LA, DC, and NYC with minimal capacity, and when you have a reservation the hostess usually kindly informs the party at your table to wind up their conversation and clear the table for the next party.\n\nAn hour passes and we are finally seated.  The manager apologized for the delay and sat us at our table. My mother muttered something under her breath, and the manager realized that we had waited over an hour to be seated when we had a reservation. He apologized and said that there was nothing that he could do. I appreciated his apology; however, he totally could have done something to get us a table sooner. For the poor customer service I give 5A5 3 stars.\n\nAs for the food, it was amazing.  I ordered the NY strip steak. It was very tender and cooked to perfection., My sister ordered the filet mignon and my parents ordered the prime rib. Both dishes were fantastic.

For sides we had the potato au gratin, very good. And last for dessert, we had the Smores, it was good & not too sweet. Excellent service. Overall, we really enjoyed it!", "author": "Jingle A."}

I got there early, so I was prompted to check out the bar. I thought they had a nice bar area which was rather large comparatively to other restaurants, hence the lounge in its name. It's nice to have that lounge area great way to wait for your friends if the bar is too crowded. After my friends arrived we were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation. Not quite sure why, but it didn't bother me too much since we didn't have plans after that. To apologize for the wait they gave us their famed truffle fries on the house which was very gracious of them to do so. \n\nOur server was very nice and I loved that she went over the menu with us. I thought it was a pretty straight forward menu, but it wasn't until after she explained that some small bites are only amuse bouche type starters vs the small plates etc. I like that she also had a display of the different cuts of wagyu meat. I definitely liked getting a little lesson. Everything on the menu looked delicious and it was difficult for me to decide just what to get. I ordered the scallop two ways and my friends shared the heirloom tomato starter. \n\nThe sashimi scallop was heavenly!!! The flavors and textures were spot on with no hint of fishiness at all. The tomatoes didn't wow me all too much, but I did like that it came with what I thought was burrata, although it had some other flavor mixed in possible a little bit of cream cheese. I only got the filet, which was much much cheaper comparatively to even the hybrid wagyu. Delicious flavors all around and they keep the accoutrement to a minimum on the steak to showcase the beef better. You can also get some sides in addition, which are shared family style. I highly highly recommend the creamed spinach. There is nothing ordinary about it although it does sound ordinary. \n\nThe rest of the night went great. The only thing that was a con was the noise level. At first it was nice and lively, but as the night went on it got a bit loud, especially the table next to us, who decided to yell across the way to us to compliment my dimple. All in all great lively Friday night dinner with great food and it didn't break the bank as much as I thought it would after splitting the bill three ways.", "author": "Kathy B."}

I reserved a table for two using yelp and under \"special requests\" I mentioned it was my husband Mike's birthday. As soon as we were seated we were given two glasses of champagne and my husband was wished a happy birthday. I believe the complimentary champagne is fairly common at this restaurant but still-a nice touch. Our meals were wonderful. I had the filet which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My husband had the T-Bone. He was also VERY pleased. We're both suckers for truffle so we couldn't not order the mac n cheese. No regrets there. It was the perfect amount of cheesy and truffle-y (new word) and we weren't disappointed by our servers recommendation to have candied bacon added. Genius. We chose the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert and in addition the server brought a small piece of chocolate cake with one candle. And he told my husband it came from me. Sweet.

All she said was that she would try her \"best to hold on to the table\" and that \"it gets pretty busy so no guarantees\".  Upon arriving, the restaurant was probably half full at most. Okay well besides that. They have valet which is I believe $8...which is convenient because I believe it is SF street parking otherwise. Very cool contemporary (almost outerspace like) atmosphere.\n\nBreaking down our meal:\n\nDrinks -- lychee martinis were to die for! Not very strong, but very good. I had two.\n\nAppetizer -- truffle fries with sriracha aioli were ridiculously delicious, and addicting.\n\nMain course -- I had the bone in dry aged ny strip with truffle butter. The portion was a little small..I'd say it was about 5 oz of meat. I had to eat some of Nat's hugeee 22 oz bone in rib eye. Overall, my steak tasted alright, and the truffle butter was honestly nothing special (the truffle flavor was more aromatic in the fries). Nat's rib eye definitely had more flavor, but I have to say I've better steaks elsewhere.\n\nDessert -- 7 degrees of Chocolate. A perfectly light and deliciously sweet way to end a dinner course without pushing you into the depths of food coma.\n\nFour stars for their food, and three for their service. If I could, I'd give this place 3 and a 1/2 stars.", "author": "Elisa C."}

I have to add, she is a very selective diner, so we were pleasantly surprised. The star attraction here is the beef. Of course right?  Steak Lounge. Each of the 5 of usl ordered a cut of the Japanese Waygu and some sides to share, along with a bottle of Chateaux Margot (BIG HINT - great wine list).  The Waygu (4 ounces for $150) was amazing.  Buttery, melt in your mouth goodness. So rich, I could only eat 2 ounces of it. Meanwhile... 11 year old ate her entire piece. Most of the sides were mediocre I'd say... Ordered hamachi spoons, ahi spoons, lobster tempura, cauliflower.  Mashed potatoes were gluey but had good flavor and the truffled mac and cheese good!

Originally, our reservations were for 7:15pm, but he couldn't get off work early enough to make it. I called the day of, and their only time for reschedule was at 9pm (which, on a Friday, is pretty normal). We arrived a little after 9pm, and the place was still pretty packed and noisy. The atmosphere of the restaurant is typical of an upper-scale steakhouse - very dim and open. Our host sat us quickly, cozily squished to the table right next to us. We ordered drinks - I had the Garden Party and he had a glass of red wine (I forget which one) - and our waiter was very gracious to us throughout our whole experience. We ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese as an appetizer, which is AMAZING! I could have had 3 orders. For our entrees, we had the Filet Mignon and the Wagyu Ribeye, which is what they are known for; both of the two were cooked to perfection. With our steaks, we had an order of their crimini mushrooms which came out to be mediocre and too heavy on the sauce. \n\nMy overall experience was great - I'd come back just for the Truffle Mac & Cheese and Wagyu. The service they give with an order of Wagyu is spectacular (because you are after all spending a minimum of $150 on a 4oz order of steak)! \n\nI think they could improve on the ambiance of their restaurant a bit more, but no complaints on food or service!", "author": "Jenna L."}

I splurged and went for the A5 wagyu beef, 4 oz of each (New York and Ribeye), and I felt like it was my birthday! This is truly the best steak money can buy.

Was crunchy yet just  the right tender texture inside. Beautiful presentation with the shells. Only gripe is it's misnamed: it's batter and fried bit but not true tempura style with an airy light colored batter. \n- Sunday half off bottles of wine: amazing deal since they have a solid list and it applies to any bottle up to $250. Only dilemma is whether to go big and order something that's typically out of your range or stay conservative and get a steal.\n- Burrata heirloom tomato salad: artistic plating with the tomatoes all in a row and a pile of burrata to one side. I especially enjoyed the cool small green tomatoes. \n- Cabernet soaked white cheddar: loved this cheese\n- Scotch cart: I've seen champagne and cheese carts, but this one was new to me. We didn't partake, but I thought of many of my friends who would love it. \n- Cocktails: my hub enjoyed his manhattan relative features on the menu \n- Busboy service: he was on top of everything and took great care of us which I appreciated (and told him on my way out)\n\nMidlights:\n- Mac and cheese: I'm not the biggest truffle person but I was excited about the trio of cheese used, but it was just ok\n- Filet: well cooked but I didn't care for the flowery herb salad on top. Seems like they were trying to be hard to be stylish and I didn't enjoy the flavor combination.\n- Prime rib: not enough flavor for my prime rib connoisseur hub\n- Boneless rib eye sauce: they used to offer it with green peppercorn which I would have liked but instead they went with mustard which I'm not a fan of so I didn't order it\n- Atmosphere: bit oddly designed and weird vibe. A circular alien ship atmosphere felt a little Reno to me. The bar area was more modern and inviting but the fire of the screen in the back seemed out of place.\n\nLowlights:\n- Waiter service: our waiter seemed nice enough, but when it got busier, things slowed down and was hard to get any service\n- Swiss chard: was way too salty--even for my salt loving hub\n\nWouldn't say I left a fan, but I'd return for lobster tempura and potentially return to try out their famous happy hour.", "author": "Eve K."}

Our waitress was very sweet and caring. She was very knowledgeble of the menu, and constantly made sure we were good on food and drinks. \n\nTruffled fries, wedge salad, jasmine tea smoked chicken, crimini mushrooms, marguro, hamachi shooters, dry aged bone-in new york steak, bacon-wrapped scallops, and creamed spinanch were all the savory items that I got to try. All were excellent in taste and presentation. \n\nI was going to skip the dessert, but our wonderful waitress suprised me by treating me to the L'opera cake (so thoughtful of her) just because my order had come out later than the rest of the group.  She also gave me complementary crimini mushrooms too because she felt bad about missing my order. So I ended up having so much food, but it was nice. :)\n\nOther pluses - the atmosphere/layout of the restaurant and its location is in walking distance to Pier 1.

It is very inviting, beautiful, and modern without being pretentious. \n\nRecently, 5A5 did an excellent job at hosting my birthday event here. They set us up with a table at 11PM and were very accommodating of every request. They even surprised me with a birthday dessert!\n\nThe up side is that they also clear the lounging area during the late evening and turn it into a dance floor.\n\nI would highly recommend this place, very comfortable environment but still maintaining that luxurious, modern feel.", "author": "Veronica S."}

I was a little apprehensive when a friend turned me onto this place during a recent trip to the bay.  A good steak in San Fran?  No friggin way!  I went o 5A5 with no expectations.  After all, how can a steakhouse in SF top the ones in Chicago.  \n\nDecor: \n\nThe decor was very impressive.  The front of house featured a full bar with a small dance floor like space.  Lighting was reminiscent of a high end lounge.  In essence, it made every look pretty, even me.\n\nService:\n\nWe sat and was promptly greeted by a waitress, whom, remained very professional throughout our dinner service.  You can tell that she takes her job seriously and has truly mastered her craft.\n\nFood:\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers.  My personal favorites were the hamachi shooter and the grilled shishito peppers.  Our table also ordered a myriad of steaks. I ordered the 8 oz F1 filet.  I must say that i have never consumed a steak that is fork tender and literally melts in your mouth.  Bite after bite and the consistency remained the same throughout.  I was very impressed by the quality of the meat.\n\nAll in all, 5A5 will me my go to steak house in SF.  I would have never found this place on my own had it not been for my friend's recommendation.

We love going out to eat following a rigorous day of shopping and sightseeing.   Because this was a holiday weekend, we had trouble getting reservations at a prime rib house we wanted to try, so settled here.  We were troubled right away upon entering the establishment.  Just after being seated, we were asked if we had frequented before.  When we said no, we were asked if we would like to take a tour of the menu.  I said yes, and the waiter just disappeared on us.  He just left - I thought he was going to go over the menu.  I asked my wife did I just order the tasting menu?  When I saw him pass by, I tried to get his attention when he raised his hand at me to wait.  After five minutes, another waitress came by with an unimpressive display of wagyu cuts.  This was a terribly veiled attempt to sell tourists or the poor bloke on a date into buying overpriced meat.  When I told her she needn't waste her time, as I already know what I wanted, her facial expression couldn't mask her sentiment of dissatisfaction. \n\nAnyway, here is our order:\n\nWe wanted to start with the octopus salad, but of course they were out of that.\n\nWe opted to start with the seared foie gras.  This was excellently prepared with a generous cut.  Perfectly seared albeit a bit overly sweet with the fruit reduction it was served with.  However, would still recommend it as it was enjoyable.\n\nFollowing was a simple arugula salad with goat cheese and golden beets.  This was uninspiring as it tasted like any other arugula salad with goat cheese that can be got at your family Italian restaurant around any corner.  The beets were too soft and tasted boiled and not roasted.\n\nWe shared the t-bone steak which was a generous cut - I believe 20 oz.  The meat was well cooked and the quality was good.  It tasted aged as was described.  This is where less is more, but unfortunately we got more.  I didn't know the meat would be served with a glaze.  So, unfortunately, this beautiful piece of meat was ruined with a glaze that was on the salty and sweet side, better suited for an asian fusion restaurant over sirloin skewers at happy hour.\n\nAdditionally, I ordered two glasses of wine that were overpriced for their label and the pours were bordering on theft.  Looking at the price of their alcohol, the cheap plastic attempt at modernism on the walls, and service, clearly a poor attempt to mask this establishment as something it is not.\n\nNeedless to say, we skipped the dessert and were pleased our Uber was only minutes away.", "author": "Johnny R."}

But hear me out....\n\nThe bf and I wanted to go somewhere nice before going to see Wicked at the Orpheum. I just so happened to have gotten a new job recently (Yay, me!) so this dinner was going to double as a celebration dinner. I wanted to go somewhere nice, not like Boboviquari's, and somewhere I hadn't been before (otherwise we would have gone to Bob's Chophouse). BF made the executive decision and decided on 5A5, after first picking Harris, and  Bix. So our little adventure here was definitely a labor of love. The fact that I was so pleased and impressed with the food and service earned 5A5 the extra star.\n\nReservations were at 5:30, but the bar opened at 5. We each had a drink - I had a Tokyo tea, which was strong....the way I like it. We were seated and our server - Erika - introduced herself and took our order of the truffle fries with sriracha aioli (Please order this....you will NOT be disappointed).\n\nErika was great, she was super attentive yet not all conversational. I love nice and friendly servers, but that night, I wanted it to me intimate and just about me and him. She was on point with her service game. Plus I watched her serve other tables and pour their wine, etc. Someone should give her kudos for being professional and attentive to the guests. Seriously, The food could have been great but mediocre service would have cost a star and the likelihood of us returning. So big ups to Erika!\n\nHere is what we had:\n\n- Bacon bread and regular bread with butter (free): F'n tasty! The bread was a great way to get our appetites going\n- Carrot soup with creme fraiche (amuse bouche, free): Earthy and yummy\n- Truffle fries with sriracha aioli: See above paragraph\n- Wagyu tartare: Our favorite thing that we had all night. The tartare is one spoonful, so for two people you need to order two. It was SO worth it. There was a cool complexity of flavors happening. It was like a party in my mouth (ba dum bump, pshhh)\n- Butternut squash (amuse bouche, free): tasted like the peach section from a fruit cocktail\n- Truffle Mac n cheese: Creamy and oh so delicious\n- Sauteed swiss chard with parmesan: Really good. Loved the acidity...good balance with the parmesan\n- New York steak: BF said it was tasty\n- Rib Eye with balsamic demi glace: Would definitely order this again, unless somehow I decided to splurge and get the Wagyu, lol\n- Bone marrow sauce: Left much to be desired\n- Madeline cookies (amuse bouche, free): Meh. \n\nYou can mix and match any of the sauces to any of the steaks. I asked for the marrow sauce on the side because I couldn't decide on whether I wanted that or the demi glace. Demi glace was PERFECT. We ate EVERYTHING and had no room for dessert. *sad face* I would have loved to have tried the apple dessert (forgot what it is now) but I was just too full. \n\nI was thoroughly happy that bf chose this place - we had a great time! Erika was great and the other servers/food runners were super nice as well.  Food was wonderful - all of that, including tip came out to about $200. That included my Tokyo tea and his scotch, so not too bad. Worth it, in my book for the great food and experience.\n\n5 5A5 STARS!", "author": "Leilani A."}

All together, you have a perfect setting, with only the food to be palatable. Well, that would be an understatement - it is of the highest quality, in presentation, creativity and taste. Even the sweet potato fries were executed perfectly, sitting in a metal container to keep them warm. (Made me wish I had tried the truffle fries)\n\nWagyu sliders are the way to go if you don't want to (or can't splurge for the 3-4 varieties of the special Japanese beef that is otherwise at $29 / ounce. Our waitress, a very professional and gracious young woman, explained the menu without too much fuss, and blanched not one bit when we stayed light with our order. \n\nShrooms (yes, that's how they are listed) are a wonderful side order, as I can imagine would be the others - if the restaurant takes their small servings to such a high level, you can be confident their big plate specials will come in satisfyingly.\n\nLocated in the historic Jackson Square area, right next to another fab place (Kokkari), 5A5 Steak Lounge delivers in all the ways that count.

Apple/Pear Tart with ice cream-this was awesome! Would love to have this again.\n\nAfterwards, having drinks is always fun.

Will NEVER go again.\n\nAtmosphere: At first glance, the restaurant had a great vibe-- very energetic, intimate lighting, and chic decor. I thought it was going to be a great night for me and 3 friends who wanted to enjoy the amazing steak everyone raves about! I was actually looking forward to it all day, but I was seriously disappointed.\n\nService: My friends and I had an 8:30 reservation. We arrived at 8:30 pm tonight, checked in with the hostess, and waited 15 minutes before asking again about our table. I was a little upset because I didn't see the point of making a reservation if we were going to have to wait anyway. \n\nI waited another 10 minutes, and finally got a table. When I asked to speak with the manager about how the restaurant could prevent similar situations like this from happening again by spacing out reservations more, he approached me and accused me and my friends of arriving late to my reservation... in fact, he said \"You guys were 10 minutes late anyway.\" When I told him after confirming with my friends that we did, in fact, arrive at 8:30, he said it's not their fault and spoke very offensively towards us, again in an accusatory tone. \n\nIf that service wasn't bad enough, he never apologized for his attitude or the lack of professionalism in the hospitality industry. As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I graduated from Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration and have learned the ins and outs of hospitality-- whether that be hotels, restaurants, or airlines, I have learned and experienced them all. I know how valued guests should be treated, and I did not feel that this establishment met any of the basic criteria you would expect.\n\nAftermath: I was so offended by the manager's attitude that I left the restaurant. I don't think I can ever say this enough, but I will not support any business that treats their guests this way.\n\nI would love to hear what 5A5's upper management has to say about this, especially their owner. Until then, I will only dine at Alexander's Steakhouse for great steaks and fine wine. Alexander's obviously offers more superior service.\n\nBest,\nS.C.", "author": "Shannon C."}

The drinks, fries, and hamachi shooters were so delicious! After being seated for dinner, our server was so nice about explaining the entire menu to us and all of my ridiculous questions (I am so picky!). I told her that I loved when meat has a crust on the outside and is tender/juicy on the inside, so I took whatever recommendation she had for me. It took us a long time for our party to arrive and for us to finally order, but when the time came for us to take ALL of our orders, she asked me if I would like for her to note that I wanted it to be cooked w/the extra char crust on the outside! That was so thoughtful!\n\nWe ordered a bunch of sides for all of us to share and all were wonderful! The meat was cooked perfectly on our main dishes and being the greedy little piggies that we are, we devoured plates and plates and plates of the BACON BREAD! Yes, BACON BREAD! They need to sell this by the loaf because this bread was absolutely delicious! At one point, we had a few pieces left and a staff member mistakeningly thought we were done w/it and cleaned our table along with the bread. When the server realized this, she brought another plate! \n\nTo make a great night even better, when I made the reservation, I noted that this was a going away party for a friend moving to Asia. After we were done eating and just having a few drinks and a chat, the owner came by to ask who was moving to Asia and came to wish her well!

The fact that it was a company dinner didn't hurt - lots of free food on my boss? Woot! We also scratched our heads wondering whether a fellow friend was playing a trick on us or not, but we also got several appetizers \"complimentary\" of the owner - whether it was truly from the owner or a trick one of my boss's friends played on him, it doesn't matter, the thing is, the food is good!\n\nhere's a list of what I remembered eating:\noyster shooter\nmy coworkers had the hamachi shooters\nyakimono shrimp\ntruffle fries\nkona kampachi carpaccio- yum\nbacon wrapped scallops\nI got the boneless ribeye steak which was well portioned for a small person - still had leftovers.

For starters, we shared truffle fries and a caesar salad. The caesar salad was pretty standard, but the truffle fries were delicious... they were flavorful enough on their own, but they came with a sriracha aioli dipping sauce that was so good we had to ask for more. The fries come in a huge basket, so we were munching on them even after we got our entrees.\n\nWe both ordered the 6 oz filet, which came out cooked to our satisfaction, and mac n cheese and \"shrooms\" (assorted wild mushrooms) on the side. Everything was fabulous, and I would order again except for probably the shrooms... there was just nothing too special about them and they tasted rather plain.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the fried cheesecake. As we both love cheesecake, we had high hopes for this dessert... but it really didn't taste like cheesecake at all! It was kind of a disappointing end to our meal, but now I know not to order it next time.\n\nOn a side note: they have co-ed bathrooms, so don't be surprised if someone of the opposite gender emerges from the stall beside yours.. you're not in the wrong bathroom!", "author": "Kavita S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-16", "description": "Recently came back twice in the same week for dinner and was happy to have tried so many different things from the menu.  The place was packed on both nights and the service was great.  Once we walked through the door we were greeted by the hostess who gave us the option to grab a drink at the bar or sit down at the table.  We opted to grab a drink from the bar since we were waiting other people in our party to arrive.\n\nLounge/Bar - Cool lighting and decor.  I like how they have lounge seating and little tables as well as seats at the bar for those who just want to hang out with a drink and snack on appetizers.  They have happy hour specials as well.\n\nDinner Service - This place can get busy and a little loud, but the service and the food make up for it.  The wait staff are helpful, attentive and know their food (very important!).  The restaurant name says it all:  5A5 Steak LOUNGE.  This is a place to go to enjoy a nice meal with friends while sipping on some wine or something.  The time between appetizers and entrees didn't bother me as much this time around because I knew what to expect and the time passed by with the right company/conversation.\n\nOn to the food...here we go...** signify the items I will definitely have again...\n\n- hamachi shooter and **maguro shooter:  the ingredients are so simple, but when you put them together it creates a winning combination.  The hamachi shooter is great, I don't prefer ginger so I liked the maguro shooter more.  The fish was fresh and cut to just the right size.\n\n- **shishito peppers:  I didn't think I would like these peppers so much, but I do.  The kabayaki sauce goes very well with the natural taste of the peppers.  Most of them are not spicy, but I was told that once in awhile you get lucky and it's spicy.  I wasn't that lucky.\n\n- **lobster tempura:  this is a dish that everyone needs to try at least once (if you like lobster).  Large, juicy, and tender lobster cooked to perfection.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  A little of the sweet & sour shiitake dipping sauce goes a long way.\n\n- seared foie gras:  had to get my foie gras fix in before it gets banned in July.  I liked this dish.  I prefer eating this on some toast or something so I used the bread that they provided at the beginning of our dinner.  So buttery...so good.\n\n- romaine heart salad:  they do Caesar salad the way it's supposed to be done - with anchovies.\n\n- beet salad:  tasty.  I liked the combination of the different beets with the goat cheese and pistachio nuts.  Flavor and texture wise, this dish was great.  I was expecting some sort of greens mixed with the beets, but no.  It was all beets.  Shared this with 3 other people and we had more than our share of beets for the night.\n\n- **prime rib:  SO MUCH FLAVOR.  The garlic - mustard rub created the perfect crust and my medium rare was perfect.  Surprisingly, I liked this more than most of the steaks that I tried from other people.\n\n- the tomahawk:  32 oz steak.  Bigger than my head.  Enough said.\n\n- **dry aged bone in filet:  this was a great piece of meat.  i especially liked the section right next to the bone.  This would be my go-to entree if the prime rib was sold out.\n\n- colorado lamb duo:  cooked perfectly, not too gamey.  I also enjoyed the spring rolls that came with it.\n\n- **truffled mac & cheese:  DELICIOUS.\n\n- marble potatoes:  think baked potato with all the fixings, but substitute a whole potato with a variety of mini potatoes.  Super filling.\n\n- shrooms:  can't go wrong with these.  I loved the taste from the sherry wine and garlic.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday nights the lounge kicks into overdrive.  The music starts as the restaurant goers are finishing up their meals in the dining area.  I had my birthday here on a Saturday night last year and had a amazing time.  Love the fact that they don't charge a cover so I didn't have to worry about having friends pay extra to party with me on my birthday.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

We finished off the meal with the cholocate fondant, and the ice cream trio.\n\n1. Appetizers, Himachi shots & Lobster tempura\n\n1.1 Himachi shooter\nDelicious. \n\n1.2 Lobster tempura\nThe lobster tempura has been different every time I have ordered it here, and my favorite one was the first one. The first version was on Dec 31st, 2010, ringing in the new year. This lobster tempura was flaky, soft, and served with a butter sauce.  They served it side by side with a crab leg, that was great too. \n\nThe second one wasn't memorable, and this 3rd one wasn't either. I remember it, but only because it just happened a few hours ago. I probably won't remember it tomorrow. The lobster was a bit tough, and the shells layered on top flaked into the tempura itself, wheras the other servings had the lobster tempura nestled inside the shell for a much easier removal. The sauce they served it with today had too much of what tasted like vinegar, but I can't put my finger on it.\n\n2. Meat. Sides.\n\n2.1 Filet Mignon w/bone marrow sauce and bone marrow croquette\nI was surprised that after being here twice I discovered that their menu allows interchangeable fix ins with the steaks. I sat there debating the t-bone only to try the bone marrow croquettes (labeled as \"fried bone marrow\" on the menu). I think they should call them croquettes so that people have a better visual in their mind of what it might look like. Fried bone marrow sounds like it could have been minced and fried for all we know, but moving on...\n\nThe filet mignon was delicious, perfect, and a 5-star preparation. It was tender, juicy, full of flavor. The only thing I would have liked is more sauce, of any sort. Butter sauce, bone marrow sauce, just more.\n\nThe filet mignon was so tender and perfect, I felt like I could flake it apart with my fork. It was truly one of the best preparations of a filet mignon I've had to date. My compliments to the chef.\n\nThe bone marrow croquettes were wonderful, and much better than I had expected. I will definitely come back and order this again, I highly recommend it.\n\n2.2 Truffled mac and cheese\nCreamy, delicious, a winner for the whole table. We all kept going in for more. \n\n3. Desert.\n\n3.1 Chocolate fondant\nThe chocolate fondant was as should be expected, full of hot melted chocolate in a warm flaky cake. \n\n3.2 Ice cream trio\nPopcorn, green tea, espresso. All great, but the green tea was my favorite. The popcorn didn't really taste like popcorn but it was ok nonetheless. The espresso was not as impressive.\n\n3.3 Coffee\nPretty good, could stand to be a bit more bold, it was very mild and just a touch of creamer really ran it down.", "author": "Roxy G."}

Oh yeah. See: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4500505494_f70ee5fcc4_b.jpg\n\nThe bread was warm and had the slight hint of bacon. As the server said: we take our bacon seriously. Yes, yes they do. The bread was warm and delicious. \n\nLet me interrupt the food part of this by saying that our server Wes was phenomenal. I eat at a lot of restaurants and have been to several steakhouses and Wes was awesome. He started off by explaining the layout of the menu and what the favorites were which I definitely appreciated. Whenever I had stupid questions about the food like \"where do you get your bacon?\" and \"what is that other party in the other room?\" he went out of his way to find out and make conversation with us. Service-wise they were on top of it with water and bread refills.  Wes was very cognizant of the fact that we had an 8pm show to make in Oakland and needed to be out quickly. He in no way rushed us and humored us in conversation. \n\nBack to the food - the star of the night was the bone in rib eye steak. Look at this picture and drool: \n\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4499850637_b47a304d69_b.jpg\n\nIt is worth noting that 5A5 is one of the few places in the US that has Wagyu/Kobe quality beef. It is pricey and we didn't have it but what we did have was amazingly tasty so I can only dream of what the Wagyu would be like. That may have to be a special celebration type meal. \n\nI love that 5A5 does Opentable points as well. \n\nWe ordered the truffle fries and Mac and cheese with truffle so if you're at truffle person like my always lovely date Sofia H, you'll love this place. \n\nPicture of mac and cheese: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2694/4499871457_5a0d786560_b.jpg\n\nThe Mac and cheese was ok. Good but not amazing. \n\nWhat I did REALLY like was the iceberg lettuce salad we ordered. \n\nSee: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4499870983_7987177c8a_b.jpg\n\nThe bacon that came with it was AWESOME. If you see the picture above you'll see the thick chunks of amazingness that came with it. This salad was fantastic. The blue cheese dressing that came with it was out of this world good. \n\nI think this is a great place for a date that likes to eat a quality steak. It's got a Vegas lounge sort of look that I think emits a Frank Sinatra type vibe. \n\nI was VERY impressed with 5A5. I had been there before for a Yelp Elite event and waited until I actually had dinner there to review it. It was worth the wait. I have a feeling I'll be a regular there for special occasions and when people are in from out of town. \n\nIf you are curious about prices, see: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.5a5stk.com/dinner.pdf&pli=1", "author": "Carlos A."}

When I'm a billionaire, I'll return and drop some serious cash on the wagyu. \n\nIn summary they really know how to give the VIP service. We made a reservation but called to let them know we would be a little late, and they were so nice as to reserve our table until we arrived (and they don't give attitude! So nice). Their reservations were a bit difficult to get but maybe it's because I came on Mother's Day. For any future 5A5 goers, I'd recommend you try to make a reservation ASAP. Anyway, their service is attentive and friendly without being overbearing, drinks are strong but delicious, steaks are cooked to perfection. I was surprised at how good the food here is because most Asian fusion places I've been to have been a giant fail. I loved the pacing, meaning the appetizers, drinks, main course, dessert, etc. arrived in perfect time. There were several compliments from the chef, which the waiter said changes very frequently (meaning no 2 5A5 experiences will be the same). Even though it is 3 dollar signs on Yelp, you have to admit that you walk away extremely full and satisfied so in the end, the price to quality to quantity ratios are perfecto (but hey, I'll take a free meal from here if the opportunity ever arises).\n\n5A5, you make my tummy so warm and fuzzy that I'm about to explode into rainbows and unicorns.", "author": "Jolene L."}

I guess a can deal with the \"lounge\" part of the name...\n\nI've seen the various iterations of 5A5 as it started as A5 and had a awkwardly long soft opening period. But after they scored the former sous chef of Alexander's Cupertino, Allen Chen, as their new chef sometime in 2010 things changed for the better quickly. It is more of an upscale experience, but the steak is still king whether you have a standard steak or opt for the wagyu. And for the recent concern over \"fake\" wagyu that is raised in the states, 5A5 serves the true Australian F1 Wagyu. In other words, it's the only \"real stuff\" that exists until Japanese Wagyu returns.\n\nAnd as the FOIE GRAS countdown starts to wind down, we were told of an interesting dessert made by the pastry chef, another Alexander's Cupertino alum. The FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM served over a Maple Pecan Bread is off menu and a must try before the July 1 doomsday date arrives. The ice cream may be rather aggressive(ly foie) for some, but balances well with the cake. You'll love this dessert if you love Foie Gras. \n\nAs a final note, while you want to be known solely for who you are now I still have to say 5A5 is a lot of what Alexander's Cupertino used to be.

We had reservations at 630 but we were early so we decide to have happy hour. Totally weird bc u can't have happy hour at your table. You can only have happy hour food and drinks in the lounge. Ok I guess thats fine. We sat in lounge area ... 6 people cramped up with two small circular bar tables. We ordered truffle fries... So delicious.. Oysters.. Not so much! There were sand in our oysters and we ordered two dozen :( but the shooters were awesome. We had the hamachi n oyster shooters. Yummy. Drinks were pretty cheap as well. The cocktails were a hit or miss. I liked a few but disliked a few as well.\n\n\nAtmosphere and ambiance was awesome. I love the decor of restaurants chairs n tables. However, Downstairs unisex bathroom is a bit weird. Its so dark u can't even see urself in the mirror. I guess that's why they put mirrors right inside ur bathroom stall????

I've seen reviews on how horrible the service was but on the night I went, service was great.\n\nBut the food sucks. We did dine about town and literally nothing good to say about it. Daikon soup was weird. Salad was not cut and small. Nothing special for a \"fancy\" restaurant. Everyone in my party didn't like their steak. For god sakes... I feel so bad bc I made them go. And I feel so bad for myself bc my steak came cold. it was horrible. I ordered medium rare... It came cold and overcooked. How is that even possible? I complain to the waitress and she said its probably the cold bean sprouts in top. No honey, the meat was cold all around. And she took it back .. Had it warmed up and gave me the exact same piece of steak.... Arrrrghhh... It's super cheap for them to get and yet they sell for much more money. And they want to give me the exact same steak I had? They couldn't even cook me a new one after I complained after one bite????

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-18", "description": "I really, really wanted to give this a 5-star rating.  Soooo not happy about several things, but I had a good time celebrating my birthday.  If I go back here, there will be things I change.  I will order the Fajima with no sauce, request a table in the center (surely the good servers are here), make a reservation for earlier in the evening, and send back anything that is overcooked.\n\nLet's start at the beginning - I chose this place because of the neat ambiance.  I picked it over Anderson's and the other high end steak houses in San Francisco specifically because of the white booths, funky ceilings, piano player, more lively atmosphere.  They seated my husband and me in the farthest back corner of the restaurant.  (We were well dressed and had made reservations a couple weeks in advance so it wasn't a rush job and we didn't walk in looking like bums.)  The vibe doesn't carry over to the back area of the place.  It is dark and brown in the back.  There's bad lighting and no table cloths.  There's booths on one side and two chairs on the other, so seating was just really weird.  There were flaps on the table to make it smaller so it could be adjusted for seating for two, but they didn't adjust the table or remove a chair.  To me, that's a rookie mistake.  \n\nThe server came over and took our drink orders and explained the menu.  He was pleasant enough.  He wasn't anything like what others have been raving about.  He did tell us that they were low on prime rib and when we ordered creamed spinach for a side he said they were out of that as well, so maybe an 8:15 reservation is too late if you want to be able to have your choice of dinner options.\n\nThe starters were ok.  We got the oyster bite and it was great.  The Lobster Tempura (server recommended item) was not fantastic.  I don't recommend it.  \n\nWe ordered the regular filet 6 oz ($29) and the Tajima F1 Filet 8 oz med rare ($120).  The regular filet was served with some sprigs of something on top and smothered with sauce of some sort that was not good.  I couldn't taste the meat.  I figured a steak house would want to showcase the quality of their meat and their chef's ability to cook a steak properly.  However, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nThe Tajima filet is served with mushrooms on top and drenched with some kind of sauce as well.  My husband requested it to be prepared without the mushrooms.  It was delivered to the table covered in mushrooms.  When he pointed out the error, the server took the dish back and returned within one minute and it didn't have mushrooms on it.  Luckily, my husband doesn't have a severe mushroom allergy or that could have been bad because they clearly wiped off the top of the steak and put more sauce on it.  Then when he cut into the steak, it was more medium well than medium rare.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of it to share with you guys so you could see it.  He isn't a complainer and he told me to let it go, but I was horrified that a place that is supposed to be a very high-end steak house would serve a $120 steak wrong twice!!!  I did try a bite of his and I will admit even though it was terribly overcooked, it was absolutely wonderful.  I regretted instantly not having ordered this cut of meat.  This is the only reason I gave this place two stars.\n\nFor the sides - we ordered mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and creamed spinach.  For two people, two sides are plenty, but I love creamed spinach and wanted to try theirs.  However, they were out, so no go on that.  But our server either didn't hear me order the mashed potatoes or forgot I ordered them because we didn't get them with our food.  After he fixed the mess up of my husband's steak, I asked him about the potatoes and he said \"Oh I must have missed that part of your order.\"  \n\nTo his credit, I asked him to pick a cabernet to go with the meal and he picked a very good one, but other than that, he seemed to flounder a bit.  \n\nThe dessert was decent.  We had caramel apple and smored.  It was my birthday and they gave me a little plate with happy birthday on it.", "author": "Yvonne M."}

The scallops were perfect- we were given raw and grilled scallops and the pesto that accompanied them was very complimentary. We were then given chicken liver pate crustinnis as a compliment from the chef and they were surprisingly delicious. For the main course I had the filet mignon & babe had the new york steak. My vocabulary isnt advanced enough to describe how good both were, but they were terrific. We also ordered the creamy spinach & truffle mac&cheese.

Ceasar Salad, Ribeye steak and ginger creme brulee on the plate. YUM! And on top of that we ordered a side of truffle oil fries. My favorite was definitely the ceasar salad and ribeye steak.

I avoided the anchovies, well because anchovies aren't my thing. \nThe ribeye steak was made the way I like, medium rare.

When I heard I'd be eating at 5A5 with some coworkers I worried that the food would be too heavy or too greasy.\n\nI ordered a really lovely salad with some of the best bacon ever. Thick cut strips... (maybe the cheek?) and really fresh veggies. The bread on the table even had little classy sprinkles of real piece of bacon in the dough. I know I said I didn't want greasy or heavy but bacon doesn't count! The Steak I ordered as an entree was great too. A smaller portion, nice and pink in the middle and super tender. \n\nFor dessert I had bread pudding. One of my all time favorite desserts. I can be pretty picky when it comes to this dish and they really impressed me. The top of the dessert had a creme brulee type of topping.

After looking at the restaurant online, viewing their menu, even viewing pictures, I figured this would be the perfect place!\n\n Once we arrived, we were immediately seated (great!) Unfortunately, while being seated towards the back of the restaurant, the recessed lights were shining brightly in my eyes, and I felt as though I was in an interrogation room! We laughed at it, hey, a lights weren't going to effect our date.\n\nOur waitress was kind and noted that since it was our first time, we were in for a real treat because they have \"the best steaks in town\". She told us that she had been with the restaurant since its' opening and helped us decide what to order. So with the knowledgeable waitress, my Fianc\u00e8 ordered the Prime Steak and I chose the Filet Mignon--both medium well. The drinks took a little longer than anticipated to come out, but they were fresh. \n\nThe two of us were laughing and talking, really enjoying our time, and then I realized I was hungry!! My fianc\u00e8 pointed out that we had been waiting 45 minutes and we had not seen our waitress in the time that had passed. I flagged the waitress down who ensured our food would be coming out very shortly....and she was right. 5 minutes later accommodated with \"It's definitely worth the wait\"...I just thought \"I hope so\". \n\nAs my Fianc\u00e9 cuts into her steak, it looks great! Juicy, well dressed, she loved it. Eagerly cutting into mine, it's brown on the inside as well. As I'm taking a bite, I am immediately dehydrated from eating my well done Filet Mignon. I thought 'this can't be....I waited 45 minutes for a dried steak?!' I cut another piece hoping it was medium well further into the steak and not to my surprise....still brown and dry. My Fianc\u00e8 was disappointed for me as well and had to give me some of her juice so mine wasn't dry!! I was so angry, I had lost my appetite. The waitress had no concerns on why I basically had a whole steak on my plate but was more than excited to offer another beverage.\n\nFor a steak lounge place this shouldn't be something anyone experiences.

But sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Take one for the team. Basically, I was going to eat me a steak. \n\nThe first thing I loved about this place was the bread...fluffy and chewy and one kind had bacon in it!

A deal that we didn't want to pass up on since the bf has been jonesing for steak lately.\n\n5A5 doesn't have the ambiance of a traditional steakhouse.  It's trendy, modern and hot. I love the circular lighting in the main dining area, the plush cream/chocolate leather seating, the fireplace situated right at the entrance that makes you go \"wow, that's cool\"\n\nIt didn't take us long to make our choices and our server, Daniel, was right there ready to answer all of our questions and offered recommendations. (hey, wine lovers, bottles are 50% off on Monday nights!) \n\nFor starters, the caesar salad with spanish white anchovies. The romaine lettuce is served with whole leaves.  Why is that? I don't like cutting up my own salad, however it had a nice tangy dressing and I like anchovies. \n\nOff the regular menu, the poke and hamachi shooters come at $4 each.  You get a shot glass filled with sashimi-grade fish mixed with other ingredients like avocado, soy dressing, ginger,etc. You're supposed to finish it in one shot, but I had to bust out the fork. Interesting concept though.\n\nNot too long after, our entrees came. The 10 oz. filet mignon was absolutely tender, accompanied with shiimeji, capers, prosciutto and sage.  (the filet mignon is not offered on the DAT menu)  My 6 oz. NY strip steak came with a shishito pesto and pickled ginger. I requested mine medium which came out juicy and had a nice char at the top. Since the entrees don't come with any sides, we ordered the roasted fingerling potatoes with meyer lemon gremolata. A wonderful choice as the potatoes were appropriately seasoned. (there are no S&P at the table) \n\nDessert was such a joy to eat. I'm not usually drawn to bread pudding but their sticky toffee bread pudding with vanilla ice cream had me licking my dessert spoon to the last bite! The ice cream had a salted caramel topping which was delightful. Definitely a sweet ending to our date.\n\nAn extra thank you to our server and the rest of the crew for the excellent service.

Also, how about getting some of this magical bacon bread for turkey sandwiches somewhere? Hit me up if you know somewhere that does this please.\n\nNext I moved on to an iceberg lettuce salad, which sounds boring, but again had a shining star in the bacon. It was really thick cut strips that tasted so good. Then came the salmon, which was also accompanied by bacon. (Are you seeing a trend yet?!?) The bacon this time was mixed with potato cabbage wrap concoction. Not sure exactly what it was, but I am sure it was tasty.\n\nLastly we had the option of bread pudding or banana tart.

Where that went wrong was when the runner dude gave me the regular amuse bouche and gave my friend the shishito pepper alternative. At this point we didn't know that the amuse bouche had scallops in it, so I was ready to dive in (and it was miso soup or something that didn't scream scallops). Luckily my friend asked why he'd been given something different, and the mystery was solved.

It was dry, no flavor, sauce didn't complement at all. Service was fine. \n\nSecond time, I decided to try the fish they had on the Dine About Town menu (online, it was Chilean sea bass, but when we got there, it was Norwegian salmon). Salmon was overcooked and came with a side of cabbage-wrapped bacon bits. Not a fan. Service was fine. \n\nThird time, came for the bar/after dinner dance party, though no one was dancing. There were three bday parties going on. It took me half an hour to get a drink at the bar.\n\n Want to know why? Because the male Asian bartender kept serving his friends first, even if they walked up after I did. I made eye contact with him several times, and he STILL served other people first! \n\nFinally, frustrated and angry, I blurted, \"EXCUSE ME, I've been waiting for a while.\" \n\nHe ignored me (surprise, surprise).

We chose 5A5 but unfortunately didn't make a reservation. The dining room was semi full but still had tables but we were told there was no seating but the full menu was available in the lounge area. We don't know the area so decided to stay instead of heading somewhere else. There was live piano music which really livened up the atmosphere. We were the only ones in the lounge for a while and kinda made us feel like we were sitting at the kids table. A few 2 person tables stayed completely open during our dinner and only had people seated right as we were about to leave. I assume they just had to leave them open just in case we weren't done and a reservation came in. Just hard to stare at a table while you are uncomfortably on a lounge and a table that can't fit your plates. Our server though was AWESOME. She was so friendly and made sure that we didn't feel like we were being forgotten, which can happen when you aren't in a main dining room. She was knowledgable on all of the menu items and the wine list. \nThe food: The food totally made up for anything that was going on with the table. We each had a glass of wine that was really good. We started with the truffle fries which were so good. The texture of the fry was perfect, like a gourmet in n out fry. I had the filet mignon while my fianc\u00e9 had the dry-aged bone in NY. Both were delicious! Mine was a smaller size and I wish there had been more! We ordered the potatoes au gratin and mac and cheese to go with. I have never had au gratin with sweet potatoes before and I am so in love. The mac and cheese was also really good. We didn't end up getting desert as we were full and there wasn't a good variety.

Last night a group of coworkers invited me to join them, so I went for the company.\n\nMost steak houses don't provide much more than a salad for vegetarians, which I don't have a problem with because... duh - steak house. In this case, 5a5 actually did have an entree I could eat and enjoy. It was a simple plate of organic vegetables with mushrooms and lentils. It was presented very well, with a runway of beet sauce through the middle. It wasn't a very imaginative dish, and not very flavorful, but it was more satisfying than a salad.\n\nI also got a side of truffle fries, which were amazing. Everyone else at the table couldn't keep their hands out of them.\n\nI was dressed casually in jeans and a button down shirt, but most of the other patrons (including my group) were a little dressier, in suits and dresses or skirts. The hostess smiled as I walked in and didn't seem to have an issue with my casualness.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we enjoyed ourselves. She also was easy to smile and laugh, which is a nice change from some nicer restaurants where they take themselves too seriously.\n\nThe sommelier helped us choose a wine, which was fantastic (2008 Sausal Private Reserve Zinfandel). One of my coworkers ordered an Old Fashioned cocktail and didn't want to finish it. He offered it to me, and I took a couple sips. I wasn't impressed. Very rarely do bartenders make a true Old Fashioned and this one was better than some but still not great.\n\nIt does get a bit noisy, so fair warning to couples looking for a quiet, romantic place.\n\nI keep reading about the unisex bathrooms, but it was not a big deal at all. They're not truly unisex, they're just individual private restrooms with a lock. I don't get the issue there.\n\nI probably wouldn't return if I got to choose the restaurant, but if I found myself with a group again, at least I know I would enjoy myself at 5a5.", "author": "D.J.

The steaks and the service was what won me over.\n\nOur table shared 3 steaks:\n- 6oz Filet Mignon ($23) with shitake mushroom sauce. \n- 9oz Bone-in Filet ($29) with tarragon\n- 25oz Bone-in Ribeye ($42)\n\nWe ordered the filet because that is the true test of a good steak house - how well they can grill a lean piece of meat to your specification. I have to say 5A5 did a superb job of delivering a medium rare, pink center, nicely browned on the edges filet mignon. Super tender, great flavor.\n\nBone-in filet was also cooked to perfection. Again medium rare, this cut  had more fat and flavor because of the bone and it was delicious. TP would have preferred it neat, without sauce so you could enjoy the pure flavor. I have to agree, that sauce on the side should be standard.\n\nMy favorite though was the Rib Eye. Mmm mmm mmm. This was succulent, juicy, slightly glistening, beautiful tenderness. I couldn't get enough of this one. They did warn us that it typically takes 40 minutes to cook to order this was first.\n\nWe did order some sides and apps to complement the meal, but they weren't nearly as good as the steaks, except maybe the fries.\n- Truffle Fries ($8), served hot, nice noticeable truffle flavor, smaller than a steak cut fry with skin, but bigger than a skinny cut fry.\n- Hamachi Shooter ($4), loved the presentation in the shot glass but totally disappointed by the taste. Mine and RL's were both over salted. Ick.\n- Mac n Cheese ($9), way too runny for my tastes\n- Sauteed Spinach ($8), it was cleansing compared to the other artery hardening items. But my tablemates were unimpressed.\n\nService - I wanted to give props to the guy who kept filling our water glasses. They never dipped below an inch below the rim. I lost count of his innumerable visits to fill our glasses. Not to mention how our waiter took care to describe the menu in detail but make eye contact with each person as if he were really talking to you (vs. my experience at Betelnut). \n\nOther Random Notables\n- Mango Mojito - I have to say this was a delicious drink.\n- Bathroom - Unisex, ultra sleek with great smelling candles. Cool central sink thing but don't lean too close cuz the water will splash unusually.\n- Noticed a private dining area in the downstairs level good for group dining.\n\nOk that's it.

I came here about a year ago and had the armadillo- a wonderful concoction of ginger beer, pepper infused liquor, simple syrup all topped with a cayenne sugar rim. When my parents took me here again I was so excited to re live that spicy moment. They didn't have the drink on their menu, like all good restaurants they have to switch it up, but I explained to our server the drink and a few moments later I was told they could make it. What great service and a fab o memory. The drink was just as I remembered it. The menu was amazing. This restaurant knows flavor pairings and isn't scared of bold notes. I had the oyster. Which was presented on a spoon in an amazing broth and a few flavorful touches. Then continued on this culinary journey with the Taco salad- nicely balanced, and I loved the heat and sour flavor from the pickled veggies. I then had the filet which was good, however, my only complaint was I wish it were more moist. The brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly, that lovely char and lemon zest added a punch. The mashed potatoes were soooo good, with the bacon maple infusion. But I felt the potato was over mashed.. more like a puree rather then a mashed potato. Which wasn't a good consistency but the flavor was spot on. To finish the dinner I ordered the cheesecake. This dessert was lovely, not too sweet, loved the poached pears, the home made ice cream was killer. All and All a lovely experience, this place never disappoints.

We were the first ones in for a 5:30pm reservation, besides a large party that had congregated at the bar, waiting for their table as well. The wait was like 5 minutes, if that. Very prompt! As we had gotten there early. I cannot begin to describe how awesome this experience was. So I will just get into it. The explanation of the menu was very thorough and very warm. Our waiter was awesome! The service we received was top notch. Including the guys bussing the table. We had a great view of the kitchen and it looked so calm in there. It was very reassuring! We ordered oysters, prime rib, boneless rib eye, beet salad with whipped goat cheese, truffle mac and cheese w/ lobster and creamy spinach. Everything was delightful. The oysters were the starter and it was a plethora of flavors in our mouths. They had a chili sauce on there with caviar. It was the first time I tried caviar and I was impressed. The whipped goat cheese on the beet salad was exquisite, as well as the reductions. The meat was beyond perfection. I like my meat rare and that's what I got. My boyfriend Mike felt like his medium rare was borderline medium. But the greatest medium ever. And that's what he actually wanted. He wants medium rare a bit more towards medium. The mac and cheese had chunks of lobster and may be the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. And the creamy spinach was surprising, with the crispies in it. It was a delicious contrast with the cream. A nice touch was the little extras that got sent out, compliments of the chef. There was a gnocchi with creamy truffle sauce. And warm sourdough bread, soft inside and crusty on the outside. And bacon bread as well. He sent out a palette cleanser before our main courses. We were taken care of!

Of course I can't judge a steakhouse by their steaks alone, especially in this case.\n\nWe came here for our anniversary weekend away.  When you walk in, you immediately feel.. James Bond-ish.  The bar was very trendy with the \"flame\" on the screen.  Lots of \"lounge\" room and the ceiling and decor was very modern and slick.  \n\nOur server was very sweet - I'm just bummed I forgot her name!  She helped explain the different beefs and menu selections, and some suggestions. Here's the breakdown (our eyes were more hungry than our stomachs!)\n\n- Truffle Fries - Yummy! Nice and crunchy with just a hint of truffle flavor.  The dipping sauce was great too.\n- Cesar salad for me - pretty tasty. They had the spears on the plate that I had to cut, which I was a little \"ehh\" about.  I just don't like to butcher salads at the table.  \n- Taku (?) salad for hubs - Wow that was amazingly good.  So refreshing and tasty, in the words of my husband \"I don't' want this salad to end\".  The octopus wasn't rubbery at all, and the hint of seaweed and crunch was sooo tasty. It could have been a meal.\n- Truffled Mac and Cheese - The parts that didn't have too much truffle oil was DELISH! Perfect blend of cheeses.  But unfortunately, some parts were doused in truffle oil, which was a little over powering. \n\n- Filet mignon special (6oz i think) - Here's where it cost them a star.  We both asked for \"medium plus\" which is in-between medium and medium well.  Well, mine was pretty much well done.  Hardly any pink.  I kept cutting into it thinking it would get more and more pink closer to the center. Nope.  I didn't want to send it back cause hell I was hungry and didn't want to wait.  It wasn't dry (thankfully) and the demi glace was good. \n- Wagyu Filet mignon for hubs (4oz) - So his \"medium plus\" was pretty raw.  It was definitely a medium rare.  But since i didn't send mine back, he didn't want to send his back either.  His was absolutely tasty, and melted in your mouth.\nWe both got a side of seared Foie Gras with our steaks.  That was YUM.\n\nDessert we ordered the Mango ice cream.  Wow that was good! They also surprised us with an anniversary cake (poppyseed cake with berries) and a happy anniversary message in chocolate.  Nice that they remembered at the end of our meal, but annoying that they (the wine guy and manager I think) were kissing ass to the couple next to us, since it was their anniversary too, but they didn't' say jack to us (no star for this either)\n\nOverall, I loved the food (the sides especially) and ambiance.

I am not sure I really like the decorations, they remind me of a somewhat modernized 70's style, which never really appealed me.\nService was generally good, but I was disappointed when I ordered a boneless rib-eye, the waitress came after few minutes asking if I wanted a boneless or a bone-in, I confirmed the former, and I finally got a bone-in rib-eye.

We decided to go to 5A5 for dinner on Saturday (8/10/13) and it AMAAAAZZINNGG...Service was over the top from the time we walked in until we left the restaurant.  Although I don't remember the names of the starter plates that we ate (because my wife ordered it) all of everything that came out was delicious.  Food came out looking good and most importantly tasted good.  I ordered the 10oz. Prime Rib and it was one of the best prime rib I have ever ate, it came out perfectly cooked (med rare) and super flavorful.  My wife ordered a rib eye and usually eats well cooked but decided to have it cooked med and she lovedddd it as well.\n\nI highly recommend 5A5 to anyone who loves steak and to those who don't eat steak because the fish dish was super yummy too (our starter plates had fish).  The lounge area is a great idea too if you just want to kick back with friends and have drinks and appetizers.  My wife and I will definitely be back soon!", "author": "K T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-21", "description": "Having already been to Alexander's Steakhouse, I was excited to try what alumnus and now executive chef Allen Chen and 5A5 Steakhouse had to offer. After cocktails upstairs, we were seated downstairs at a private room, which was beautifully decorated. A small bar sat between the private dining room and the interestingly-designed unisex restroom stalls with a giant trough-style communal sink in the middle (see pictures). We had a four course prix fixe menu, which gave us options for the second and third courses, but most of the items on the menu came right off their usual dinner menu.\n\nThe first course was a trio of seafood shooters consisting of the hamachi, salmon, and oyster shooters. Out of the three, I loved the oyster and hamachi. Who knew that watermelon would go so well with oyster? The hamachi was clean and both shooters had just the perfect amount of acid to open up the palate. The salmon shooter was a bit disappointing and I didn't care too much for the flavor combinations. \n\nFor my second course, I had the cauliflower soup and the dayboat scallops. The cauliflower soup was creamy and a great way to lead into some steak, but I was disappointed by the sweetbreads. Now as I understand it, sweetbreads are usually crisply fried and they have an almost nutty taste. I loved the flavor and addition of the sweetbreads, but I think they sat out a bit too long because all three pieces were completely soggy by the time they reached my mouth. I also absolutely hated the grand marnier raisins. Each bite was a burst of alcoholic flavor, which had no business mixing with a rich and creamy cauliflower soup. The scallops were even more disappointing as the bacon portion of the BLT was soggy and fatty without any crispiness. I thought the concept of a BLT with a lettuce puree and a tomato jam was interesting, but it didn't really come together for me. The scallops were lackluster and tasted a bit rubbery.\n\nFor the third course, I went for the 10 oz. filet mignon. The steak was a perfectly cooked medium-rare. The boursin cheese fondue on top had great flavor, but otherwise there was no steak flavor whatsoever. I tried some of the dry aged NY strip and that had some great flavor, but people around me were complaining about the overwhelming flavor of the crumbled blue cheese. I loved the mixed mushrooms as a side dish with the steak, but the haricot vert were terribly undercooked and the mashed potatoes were mediocre. \n\nI didn't really expect much for a dessert course at a steakhouse and the chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse certainly lived up to my expectations. The cake was dry and dense and the top should have been a ganache rather than a piece of chocolate. The whole thing tasted like an underperforming piece of a giant Reese's cup. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed by the presentation and execution of some of the dishes, but service was great and I really enjoyed the bacon bread that they serve up.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

We regularly come for happy hour on Fridays too but the place gets super packed and it gets almost impossible to get a table if you're not there by 5pm.

They're not served in the shot glass anymore, they are now served on giant spoons. Still delicious but it seems like the portion size has gone down. \n\nWe also ordered the malay skewers and the chicken wings but I didn't get to try it.

Here's the pecking order:\n* Amuse Bouche - small seafood pastry bite. Nice surprise & start to our evening! \n* Lobster tempura - 2 small perfectly cooked lobster tails! Great!\n* Bone-in Ribeye (25 oz) - asked them to put the pico de gallo demi glac\u00e9 on side. So glad I did. Cooked perfectly medium rare and melted in mouth like butter! I think they should just honor this high quality meat with simple salt, pepper, and some melted butter and get rid of the demi glac\u00e9 option! Great! \n* Prime Rib 15 oz - cooked perfectly medium rare. Got end piece. Flavorful au jus. Think it was very good but probably would have been more tender if it was middle cut. Next time will ask for that specifically. Very good! \n* Side Dishes - flash fried Brussels sprouts (great!), truffle mac & cheese (very good), and 3 kinds of mushrooms (very good).\n* Desserts - bacon bits creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (they were nice enough to write \"Congratulations\" in chocolate on plate for my daughter. Loved the salty sweet contrast from bacon bits. Great!). Poached peaches with tea (good). Strawberry Shortcake (super nice gesture in giving this complimentary with \"Happy Father's Day\" in chocolate. Good!).\n* Petite Candies to end dinner (gesture by chef! Nice touch again)! \n\nService - outstanding! Friendly, informative, aware, attentive but never overbearing! Plates cleared at right times! Water always filled before glass was 1/2 empty!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-05", "description": "Finally tried 5A5 from Dine About Town 2012 and it was a great experience overall. I would definitely recommend this restuarant for a date night or even to impress someone special. Stepping right into the restaurant, you get a sense of class and fanciness. The decor is very modern and dark. They offer a full bar as you wait for your seating and the drinks the bartenders make are delicious.\n\nFOOD\nRomaine Heart Salad ($10)- basically a fancy caesar salad. I'm a big fan of caesar salads so this was a perfect start. Keep in mind that this isn't your typical caesar, it is essentially long pieces of romaine lettuce tossed with dressing, parmesan cheese, croutons, and tiny bits of real anchovy. \nBoneless Ribeye Steak ($31)- 12 oz ribeye with a tasty peppercorn glaze/sauce. With the pieces shiitake mushrooms on top, it makes the dish even better/tastier. The meat is really tender and perfectly cooked. Have it medium rare, you won't regret it. \n\nSERVICE\nI think the service is wonderful and I forgot to mention that they offered free Hors D'oeuvres to try throughout the night as well. That was quite a nice surprise. The waiter was very attentive and asked if we need service every 10-15 minutes. \n\nAlthough the price of the entrees here are a bit steep, the quality of the food does make up for it. Another great steak place in SF.", "author": "Derek L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-13", "description": "In short, excellent service but the steaks are too saucy for me.\n\nOverly detailed review below.\n\nTo start, the SERVICE was excellent and I'm usually indifferent to service, good or bad. Maybe it's because our server began by saying she wanted to provide us with service that was neither cloying nor dismissive.  She hit the perfect middle ground.  I wished I can remember her name, but I don't (I do wish I had told the manager that night).\n\nSince it was our first time here, she went over the menu with us. She was an excellent salesperson. I ended up ordering a Hamachi Shooter ($4) based on her description. If you go, note how your server describes the menu. The use of \"my\" such as \"My hamachi shooter is made with...\" amused me. This personalized descriptions of the menu is no doubt calculated.\n\nWhen I ordered the 4 oz dry aged NY strip steak ($19) medium done (hey I have evolved from well done), she repeated back cheerfully, \"NY strip steak, medium done which is a nice pink throughout\" which I appreciated. My recollection of the description may be wrong but it doesn't matter because they will tell you when you order. The redness should be standard, but there's European doneness, American doneness and then there's truck stop with A1 sauce (which I never liked).\n\nI loved the service, but I didn't feel as positive about the FOOD.\n\nWe all loved the amuse bouche. I missed its presentation so I can only say it was a broth with mushrooms and tasty. I liked the hamachi shooter. My friends ordered the truffle french fries to share; it is a large portion and is overrated. The truffle taste is random depending on which fry you eat. I think this trait is typical of all truffle french fries. Some celebrchef said truffle flavors are gimmicky; I agree even though I love truffle (flavor). The palate cleanser was delicious.\n\nSteak: two of my friends shared the special that night. I do not remember the specifics but I remember it was huge. They couldn't finish it. My 4 oz steak was ok but I disliked that it was drenched with sauce. The menu stated chimichurri sauce which I thought meant light, green, and parsley. The sauce was heavy and brown. As there was nothing wrong with the food, I didn't complain. It's my personal preference. The steaks are ok but keep in mind they will be covered in sauce. Caveats: I like my salads naked (i.e. no dressing), I have weak taste buds so I need strong unobscured flavors, and I rarely eat large portions of meat for a meal. Also, this places serves wagyu steak which none of us tried. \n\nSides: My friends and I shared.  I found the same sauce problem with the brussels sprouts ($8). They were drenched in soy sauce. I took home the leftovers but composted rather than eating them (if you know me, this is significant as I eat all leftovers).  The mashed potatoes ($9) were very cheesy and creamy. It's topped with candied bacon which turned out to be pork belly and is very candied, i.e. very saucy. So don't be sad if you don't see the bacon you're used to.  I loved the mac & cheese ($9) because they used a heavy hand with the truffle oil. The menu did not state truffle oil and maybe it did not have any but we all tasted it.\n\nDECOR: Nice. My friends stared at the walls a lot because they are that nice. Open space. The bathroom downstairs is unisex and has a definite style. One of the weirder nice bathrooms I've been to.\n\nIn summary, I wouldn't go here for the food alone, but I would go for the fact 5A5 has great ambiance and service that allows you to leisurely eat your food. The last can be a rarity in this city, even at expensive restaurants.", "author": "Yan E."}

The ambiance was romantic and perfect and the ceiling was stunning and admirable. I really fell in love with the stunning interior, but I wish our food had lived up to the beautiful environment.\n\nWe arrived fifteen minutes early for our 5:30PM reservations. The hostess ushered us to the lounger/bar area for some drinks before escorting us to our table. We each ordered a drink. I went with the lychee martini (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=orqpuclvVK6bqB0jIUTygQ) and I forgot the name of his drink, but it was some sort of mojito with spicy pepper. The lychee martini was very smooth, but really a tease in terms of alcohol content. The mojito wasn't my cup of tea, it was way too spicy and it did not taste good at all. \n\nOur waitress warned us that our steaks would take some time to cook and she suggested that we go with two appetizers--which was what we did. We went with the Kobe sliders (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=WIKW3UXpBxYmD6MfrAU0KA) and the hamachi shooters (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=v_HSIfUkq6NM0H8dC8DrTA). The Kobe sliders were cute and actually more fulfilling than they looked. The beef was medium rare and had a nice bite. The hamachi shooters were a little disappointing. I've had incredible hamachi shooters before and this one wouldn't \"shoot\" at all. We were instructed to mix the contents with our fork and to \"shoot\" it, but we failed miserably. There wasn't enough liquids for the hamachi to slide down the glass, instead it was stuck at the bottom. We used our forks to pick at the contents. The textures were great, but the flavor was a little too vinegary for my liking.\n\nShortly after finishing our appetizers, our main course came out. I went with the bone-in rib eye (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=HHNhxWyWCoj-VwnziS88AA) and he went with the dry aged bone-in New York (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=5vaXjNpgj1VDyRp5dNq05g). For sides, we went with the brussel sprouts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=MidKoeOiJOmo2XRWTNjzUA) and potato au gratin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Q8cYhJGa9pwlu63f-KMV-A?select=5IMklI4AYSMXlgLTzoGDZg). The waitress totally lied to us! It did not take too long for the steaks to come out at all! Had we known, we would not have ordered two appetizers. Oh well...\n\nThe bone-in rib eye was nicely presented; however, it wasn't the best that I have had. The natural flavors of the rib eye were overpowered by the aged balsamic demi glace. I don't think the steak was cooked properly either, because it was very difficult to cut into the fatty parts of the steak. It was average, at best. He had requested for medium rare for his dry aged bone-in New York, but it came out medium. The tenkasu bits were a unique touch, but the meat was charred. Usually when meat is dry aged, it should be served very simply in order to appreciate the condensed flavors of the meat. The steak just had too much going on. \n\nOur waitress was wonderful and attentive. She did everything she could to make our evening pleasant as can be. She refilled our waters and checked up on us very often. Again, 5A5 Steak Lounge is really nice to look at, but their steaks are average.", "author": "Lien T."}

Both times we started with a hamachi shooter, which is great because the hamachi & ginger taste blends really well. I also get to try their wagyu shooter, which I think it's nothing special. We also got the truffle fries because those are awesomely good. The truffle fries portion might look small, but there's actually A LOT. My girlfriends and I are not able to finish the fries on both occasion. My first time there, I got the boneless ribeye steak in medium rare. I think it's fine until I tried my friends' dish (prime rib & bone-in filet mignon), and theirs taste soooo much better than my dish. Then my second time there, I got the prime rib (because it taste so good last time) and as expected, amazing!\n\nThe overall is a good experience because the service is good. They give us little bites when we were there and something to cleanse our pallet. They refill our water every so often that you don't even need to ask them for it. The last time I was there, the kitchen actually threw our leftovers away (when we want to take it to-go), so my waitress offer to remake a whole new batch of that order, and of course we take it :D Would I go back, yes, but probably not in a while because it is NOT cheap eating there.", "author": "May K."}

Unfortunately, you have to eat it somewhere, and that was the only downside.\nBut first - the food.\n\nThe steak (I got the dry-aged T-bone) was delicious. Cooked perfectly medium-rare, great texture, wonderful rich meaty flavor. The red pepper coulis sauce was tasty and went well with the steak, though I spread it pretty thin so it wouldn't overpower. The stuffed peppers on top were also good, but need to be eaten separately - they don't seem made to actually go directly with the steak.\nThe lobster tempura and shishito peppers were both great. The tandoori tuna tataki with watermelon was a bit odd, and the flavors didn't really seem to work well together. They also overpowered the tuna.\nThe sides were all excellent - chard, mashed potatoes, and particularly the creamy spinach, which had a miraculous smokey flavor I couldn't stop eating.\nDessert was also delicious, though the creme brulee wasn't brulee'd, which was a bit odd.\nThe wine list is on the more expensive side, but some very good bottles can be found for less than $75, and the somm. can make some excellent recommendations.\n\nNow the downsides -\nThe booths are rather poorly designed. The seats are a bit too low, and a bit far from the table, and don't breathe at all, so you're likely to end up with a sweaty butt by the end of the night. And then there's the bathroom, which is downstairs, and shared, and the entire thing smelled like someone had done some enthusiastic vomiting in there earlier. I trust that this is an unusual circumstance, but it was distinctly unfortunate.\nFinally, service was a bit confused. We ordered a round of hamachi bites which never appeared (they also didn't appear on the check, so that was good). One dessert order also got lost, and had to be re-ordered. Our server also had to reconfirm some of our steak orders, which was good, since she'd noted them incorrectly the first time.\n\nSo - lots of promise, and really great steak (I liked it better than Harris), but certainly a few rough spots.", "author": "Don H."}

Obviously it's a steakhouse so I know the prices are going to be higher than normal but saw that it was still a little on the steep side. they did offer a couple complementary items courtesy of the chef. I debated between going with the ribeye or the prime rib. The server recommended the prime rib but I wish I would've gone with the ribeye.

Our waitress (Ashley M.) was very attentive to our needs and very knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered many items for sharing (recommendations from our waitress), you can view in my collage upload. :) Can't remember the appetizer names bc of the weird Japanese words lol but for our dinner we ordered boneless ribeye and lamb chops which we ordered to be cooked medium (pink center) only. Our lamb chops came out perfect but unfortunately our ribeye came out undercooked (raw) like it was just grilled long enough to brown the outsides but inside was not cooked at all so we were unable to eat it at all. I told my waitress about our undercooked ribeye and she was very apologetic and understanding about it. I did not have her take it back to re-cook bc it was already passed their closing time (9pm) and it was already 10:15pm or so when we finished our entire meal minus the ribeye. I didn't want to wait another 15min since we were one of the last guests in the restaurant so I told her that it was ok I'm fine with it. To my surprise our waitress came back and offered to buy us our choice of desserts for me being so kind/sincere about my undercooked ribeye.

Only the front lounge area is for happy hour, so small space = limited # of tables = get there EARLY! My friend and I got there at 5pm SHARP and we were able to snag half of the seating area that was available since they closed off half of the lounge area for a private party.

I'd say definitely try the shooters (all of them! 2 for $5), truffle fries with siracha aioli (extremely addictive), and the lychee martini (which isn't at a special price, but it's soooo tasty!). If you're looking for something filling, other notable dishes are the chicken yakitori skewers and kobe beef sliders (they will only offer cheddar or blue cheese, but ask for gruyere - you won't regret it!). \n\nThey were also promoting a new tequila by having complimentary tastings, but we didn't indulge.

Reservations for Thursday for three at 7 pm. I thought the looped fire image above the bar was a little tacky, but loved the decor otherwise. It was decently busy -- full of business men and a handful of hot gals. The noise level was a little obnoxious and it was hard for the three of us to hear each other. \n\nThey brought over their bacon cheddar bread which was delish at first bite, and then the boyfriend spit out a piece of metal. Seriously. There was half a washer in his piece of bread. He really didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but seriously... METAL IN THE BREAD?!\n\nWe started off with the truffle fries (decently good fries, but the Sriracha aioli was disappointing -- tasted like mayonnaise with a hint of the hot sauce) and the tempura lobster (expensive. the batter was a little too thick and greasy, the sauce that came with it was odd and not to my liking). \n\nThe boyfriend had the iceberg salad which he reported as good. I had the Tako salad which had an amazing presentation but tasted bland and the octopus was slimy. \n\nI'm happy to report that things got significantly better at that point. The Swanson merlot we had perfectly matched with our steaks. I had the 6 oz filet mignon with a shittake sauce. Cooked perfectly, with a fantastic sauce. We also ordered the Australian kobe which was buttery and DREAMY. The buffalo filet was good, served with croquettes so yummy that my boyfriend temporarily invoked the Scrooge spirit and was hellsa stingy. The mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful and made a delightful side dish. \n\nWe ordered \"Citrus\" for dessert (refreshing, presentation was gorgeous) . ALL of their desserts sounded amazing and if I could handle waiting 20 minutes, I would've ordered the red velvet souffle.\n\nThe bill was $240. A bit pricey for mixed feelings. I still felt pretty good about the second half of the meal until we left and saw a BMW parked in front with a smashed rear windshield. The owner or manager of 5A5 was freaking out and yelling at the valet guy to give him the name and number of his supervisor. I felt sorry for the valet guy who has no control over the crazies wandering in the streets or lots or whatever, and I thought it was ridiculous that the owner/manager didn't know the main person in charge of the valet company.

Happy hour lasts until 7:30 pm, so we had the hamachi shooters (try it!) and wine by the glass at the bar - which is 1/2 cheaper than ordering from the table menu.  \n\nThe meat: We passed on the wagyu, although I was curious. The reviews just don't seem to justify the price. We had the dry aged T bone ($44), bone in rib eye ($43), and filet ($39).  My favorite was the filet.  I thought the T-bone itself was good, but it was too peppercorny for me.  The rib eye was very good. Overall, meat was yummy, well prepared, and cooked at a true medium rare... but not melt in your mouth good.\n\nThe sides: Keep in mind everything is a la carte - as for sides we ordered the mushroom (good), mac and cheese (very good) and the brussel sprouts (not bad). Get the mac and cheese.\n\nThe wine: Wine list seemed extensive.

Score 1 for people watching.\n\nBut on to the food:\nmediocre.  it's definitely not the best steak in town, and the sides are \"ok\" but overpriced.  If you're in the mood for a good steak and want the vibe of a darkened steakhouse, go to Hillstone (formerly Houstons), or just trek over to Florio in Pac Heights and get their steak frites.  so much better.\n\nDessert was a deep fried cheesecake bite, which tasted like a doughnut for the most part (who doesn't like a doughnut, so that was ok).  \n\nAll in all, bring your ultra-judgy pair of glasses if you're going to come here, have some wine, and enjoy the prada parade.  But, stick, to the bar.  the food isn't worth the $.", "author": "Tobin S."}

The restaurant was not busy and yet we were practically seated in the laps of another couple of diners and right next to the kitchen... the restaurant did not fill up wile we were eating so I can not understand the plan in smushing us in uncomfortably. One star deducted was mentally deducted leaving 4 up for grabs.\n\nThe meal was good. We dropped about $200 for the two of us and had the following:\nAsparagus soup with Manila clams. 4/5 stars\nBLT Scallops (they were good but the bacon was overwhelming) 3/5\nShrooms side dish (it was plentiful but lacking in flavor) 3/5\nPotato Gratin (3 types of potatoes, creamy, amazing) 5/5\n10 oz buffalo steak (great flavors, perfectly cooked, tender) 5/5\nShort ribs - too fatty, the sauce seemed like it was thickened with corn starch which gave the impression of lard... not so good 1/5\nMy husband had a beer and an old fashioned. He liked the beer but was not impressed with the old fashioned 3/5\nCoffee 3/5\n\nSo if I was feeling generous I could give them 3 stars for the food quality (aside from the seating issue) but there were two additional issues that forced me to deduct another star. \n\nFirstly they did not have any ice cream or gelato since their freezer was broken... I'm sorry but you charge $100 for a steak so I imagine you can get someone to find a fucking freezer on short notice. I really wanted to try an ice cream sandwich dessert on the menu and that was extremely disappointing to me. Secondly, the bathrooms are dark, unisex dungeons, with no mirrors... and they were grossly dirty. Unflushed toilets, papers on the ground. GROSS. I expected more from a pretentious, bourgeois establishment. \n\nSo another star was mentally deducted leaving two stars... and honestly that's being nice.", "author": "April K."}

The experience felt a little more laid-back than the first time. Our waitress was friendly and we didn't have to wait as long between dishes as the first time. They've also changed the menu a little bit.\n\n-- I love tuna, but didn't like the maguro shooter (hamachi was still good).\n-- Truffled mac and cheese wasn't as decadent as it was back in November. Glad I decided to hold back and just get one order!\n-- No more potato au gratin, but the marbled potatoes were pretty good. They were basically loaded fingerling potatoes. Good, but also very easy to do it yourself. \n--  Frozen liquid sable dessert is weird. I know sable = sand, but it was... TOO sandy. The ice cream and yuzu anglais was great, though.\n\nPrices of the F1 wagyu's ranged from $10-$12/oz. A sampler of all four 4-oz steaks is $175. I feel like they changed the menu to be a bit more affordable - appropriate move in this economy, I think.\n\nThey kept our water glasses full and explained every dish that came out; kudos for that.\n\nNot a bad place at all, but I probably wouldn't go back.

I've had a good number of lamb chops in my life, but never had I seen such a small rack of lamb. Yeah, I get the whole upscale thing, but this lamb chop duo was literally like, four bites.\n\nNot to mention, the most important thing for me was the cook on the meat. Even with medium rare, I have to say the lamb was a little bit on the drier side for me. It wasn't as juicy as it should have been. The shitaki mushroom spring rolls that paired the dish were good though, but I'm not too big a fan of fried stuff.\n\nThe prime rib was decent, probably better cooked than the lamb chop. Still just good, not great. Also got the hamachi and oyster shooters, Alaskan king crab legs with an egg glaze. Those were less disappointing, but still not enough to leave me wanting to come back. I will say their service was excellent, but I mean, for a place like this, they better have top-notch service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-01", "description": "This review is based on my dine about town dinner from last night.\n\nDine about town went by me in a blink of an eye, and by the time I remembered to do anything at all, it was already the day before its end.  After a brief research on locations and menus, 5A5 came out to be the best deal.  They did not skim any portion of their steak entree, packing the original $31 12oz ribeye into the 34.95 meal deal--- and I was sold.\n\nI made a reservation for 2 the day before, but had to change it to 3 within minutes as I got one more confirmation.  Not being able to change it on opentable.com, I decided that we could just stash the one extra by adding a chair...  right?  A little ghetto but totally doable, so I assumed.  And this is where I ran into my minus one star, the ingenues hostess who flat out told me that the entire restaurant was booked, and there was no way to add one more person to our party of two.  She suggested that we could sit at the lounge area or bar, or cross our fingers that people would cancel.  At my insistence to find an alternative solution, she went to check with her manager.   She returned with a message within minutes: \"Just let me know when your party is here.\"\n\nOur total tab ended up being $75/per person, and our table was this very roomy booth where one chair was added to an extended table.  So this hostess was about to deny extra revenue when a chair was simply added to solve the problem?  Humph.\n\nOur waitress, however, was friendly and helpful, and the food redeemed every notion I had previously conceived against this Asian hookup mecca.  The daikon soup was just delicious.  I wish I could have the recipe for it.  The heart of romaine was good.  The steak was exactly medium rare and the chocolate mousse concluded the meal perfectly.  We also had the wine pairing, which went with the meal nicely, for extra $20.  In addition to the DAT pre fixe, we tried the hamachi shots and side of mushrooms.  I have to say...  the hamachi shoot was not as good as Alexander's, but still delicious.  The side of mushrooms made the steak even tastier (and the entire meal a little healthier).\n\nOverall, couldn't be more satisfied as a DAT deal.  With the swanky decor and reasonable price tag, 5A5 exemplifies what DAT is really about.  A chance for us mere mortals to eat like the rich kids, at least once a year.", "author": "Jiajia C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-18", "description": "We came here last night to celebrate Brian's birthday.  For some reason, anyone and everyone we talked to had no idea where this restaurant was or if it was good or not.  I'm definitely glad we took a chance because we had a phenomenal time!\n\n5A5 prides itself as a steak lounge, but quite surprising, I would also call it a bacon lounge because anything and everything had bacon in it.  There is even an alcoholic drink with bacon in it as well!  All I can say is that I just died and went to food heaven.\n\nSince there were three of us, we decided to each order our own steak but share appetizers and sides.  With our waiter recommendation we started with the truffle fries, edamame and bacon wrapped scallops.  The truffle fries were legit.  Not too think yet not too thin.  The truffle oil and the side sauce that accompanied the fries were amazing.  The edamame was ok...it was typical of what you would get anywhere else.  The scallops...let me just go into a bit more detail about these scallops.  Not only were the wrapped in bacon, but topped with sweet potato AND another piece of bacon!  Plus the scallaps were cooked with cocoa and it had a nice sweetness to it.  The creme and aoili that surrounded the dish rounded out the flavors exceptionally well.\n\nFor our steaks we all ended up with the filet...which was topped with roasted garlic, maple bacon and tomato jam.  I mean, what could go wrong with any of those flavors?  It was probably one of the best steaks I've had in a long time.  Cooked to perfection, we could have ordered a 10 oz and skip the sides.  For sides, we got the three cheese mac and cheese and the spinach.  I favored the mac and cheese because it too was dressed in truffle oil.  \n\nSince it was a birthday dinner, we could not help but grab a few desserts.  We got the 7 degrees of chocolate as well as the hot chocolate and fresh baked cookies.  I take it that the cookies were good...actually I didn't really know since Jeanne had inhaled her cookie and could possibly have eaten ours in the process.  I like the hot chocolate but it did pack some spice and heat to it.  The 7 degrees of chocolate was a beautiful presentation with 7 different types of chocolate.  Our favorite was the chocolate dome and the cake that surrounded the dome.  None of us were excited about the mousse but I think its because they were flavored with green tea and lavender which were flavors that we don't particularly enjoy...even though its chocolate.\n\nOverall we had a great experience and major shout out to our waiter, Daniel, for an awesome time.  Highly recommend him and he was excellent in giving us food and wine recommendations.  Actually everything he recommended was spot on, so yes...definitely request him.  \n\nPerfect place for birthday dinners, business dinner or a good date.  Can't go wrong and looking forward to coming back here again.", "author": "Joel C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-23", "description": "High Points and Low Points...thats the theme of this review.  I really want to give 2.5-2.75 here.  \nI was directed to this spot by my hotel's concierge. From the exterior, it looked beautiful. We walked into the lounge, and were given a table for dinner rather easily on a saturday night without having a reservation. I felt that the service was excellent! We happily sat down to our table and started noshing on the delicious bread! So far, points for service and bread! the dining room was really cool looking, booths are laid out in \"pods\" in the center of the room, and tables ring the outside. We were seated in the middle. I felt a wind blowing. This was strange, I was indoors. Our server came over and kindly got our drink order and brought us a delicious amuse bouche of crab chawanmushi. It was definately on point. At this point we are happy, but we havent quite been able to remove our jackets due to the wind....\nThen I venture downstairs to the rest room.  Lord in heaven, WHY!  The bathroom is unisex. It reminds me of going to a gay bar. Men and women both walk into the room, ringed by bathroom stalls. In the center sits a large trough where we can all wash our hands together. Listen, restaurant designers: when we ladies get dressed up to go to dinner and we are going to drop some coin, we do not want to share the bathroom with boys. No thanks. No pee on the seat for me. The trick to navigating this bathroom is to to the family/ADA stalls, they have their own sink inside and are relatively private. But listen. I dont want to go out and adjust my pantyhouse or redo my make up in a co-ed bathroom. Period. This was like a two point deduction for me, minimum, and my mood had started to sour. As I walked back up to the dining room I noticed that my dinner companions hair was literally blowing in the wind. At this point, we asked our server to first take note of the wind tunnel, and then to help us find a way to get out of it. Turns out that because this place turns into a lounge, they jack up the AC at about 9pm in preparation for the crowd to come. Again, the service was on point. Not only did they turn off the AC for us, they did it quickly, came to check on us several times, and sent us a free appitizer. This app was fabulous, a citrus shrimp dish. We truly enjoyed it.  We ordered some (iceberg and spicy octopus, both great!) salads for apps that were also delish.  Our drinks were great.  So we've gained some points back at this point...Lets say we are at a 4 or so.  My final gripe is this, which I just didnt have the heart to bring to our kind servers attention...I accidentally ordered the bone in rib eye, which is an unreasonable 28 ounce steak.  With the wind and the unisex br and all, I didnt read beyond  \"bone in ribeye\" to find out the size or the fact that they take what should be a decent cut of meat and then slather it with balsamic glaze. If you have a good steak, why the need to coat it in sauce? The bohemoth came out of the kitchen towards me gleaming and steaming. My first bite was a giant piece of gristle, thanks for trimming it for me fellas. I promptly spit that into my napkin. It took several saws to get a human sized bite off of this slab...second bite was stringy and flavorless under the sickly sweet glaze. Oh I get it, you dont age your beef so you have to cover it in sugar?  It was really disappointing. My companions made it about 1/4 way through their petite filets, also slathered in sauce. Please, put the sauce on the plate, not on the steak, people!!!!  Our sides were very good, brussels sprouts were firm and colorful, cheesy potatoes, and mac n cheese both rich and good. \n\nStarting with no points:  Plus 3 for service, free apps, amuse and bread. Minus 2 for the bathoom.  Plus one for sides.  Minus one for my unreasonble enormous and saucy steak. \nThats how I feel about it, Im sure there are other things on the menu that are much better...and at least the service is good. I might go back here just for apps and drinks. In conclusion, its now very clear to me that I am a steak purist, and cant abide fusion.  I want meat, straight up, no chaser. should have had the overpriced wagyu....", "author": "Angelina M."}

I shrugged it off, and thought that I will enjoy what should be an amazing piece of meat...\n\nI was wrong. I have had better steak at Outback and Lone Star. I ordered the 6oz filet I was definitely disappointed in what I got for the what I paid. I also ordered a side of potatoes, which also disappointed me. I was told that sides are family style. They have weird standards of family style. No sharing of the side was needed. And the flavor of the potatoes was not anything better than something I could have come up with at home.

It was still happy hour so I ordered some stuff to munch on. The hamachi shooters were and still are the best thing on the menu, and at 2 for $5 (compared to the regular menu price of $4 each), you have to get it if you ever drop in for happy hour. It's hard to mess up truffle fries, because truffle oil just makes everything taste better, but I found the fries to be way under cooked. They give you a generous portion, but after the first couple of fries, the rest were one big mushy mess.\n\nThe custard-like take on miso soup that was our amuse bouche was \"interesting.\" It wasn't bad tasting, but the warm flan-ish texture is probably not how I'd choose to serve miso soup.\n\nOn the recommendation of a patron next to us, my friends got the bone-in ribeye while I opted for the bone-in filet mignon with seared foie gras. The rib-eye portions were generous, had a good flavor, but were also very very fatty. My bone-in filet was a little more cooked than I asked for (medium rare), but that might have been attributable to the longer cook time for the ribeyes. The demiglaze and bernaise sauces that accompanied my steak weren't memorable, which is how I can describe my steak overall. I think we did mac & cheese and potatoes to share but they nearly went untouched. Overall the meal was average, but I can comfortably put 5A5 on the lower end of San Francisco steakhouses. It definitely doesn't warrant the $50+ per steak plus sides al la carte when you can get a five-star meal with sides at HOPR for less than $50.\n\nI was a little concerned by all the reviews about over-salted steaks, but I didn't find that to be the case. \n\nThe service started out spotty. After being seated, our server said she'd be right back and we were left for 15 minutes. But after taking our orders, the service was fine.\n\nI'd come back for the bar menu but I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon for the steak.", "author": "Cristofer P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-04", "description": "I give this place 4 stars because of location.  San Francisco doesn't have a real steak house (House of Prime Rib doesn't count!), so this is about the best non-chainy place around.  In a steak town (NYC, Chicago, Dallas), it would get 3 stars and be thrown in with the eclectic group of restaurants because of the Asianish flavors sprinkled throughout and the odd side dishes, which seem better suited to a fusion-style place. The lounge atmosphere adds to the oddity of the place (it kept some space-age decorations from the prior restaurant at the same location - the Frisson Lounge, closed 2008).  However, in the end, it works well enough to be called a \"steak house,\" with quotation marks a necessity.  When push comes to shove, the place does a good enough job of cooking your meat. \n\n5A5 can get pricey; 5 entrees with 3 appetizers, 2 desserts, 1 glass of wine, and 2 coffees: $354 including tip.  This isn't outrageous for  5 meals, but don't expect any bargains.  If two of our party weren't water drinkers, we would have ended up paying closer to $425.  And, we stayed away from the ridiculously expensive Wagyu (Japanese) beef, except for one dish.  How expensive?  Angus rib eye (12 oz.) is $33; Wagyu (8oz.) version is $264. To be frank, I thought the cheaper American Angus beef items were better, or at least just as good.  The Angus NY and Rib Eye were great, the gingery ribs less so.  The place does steak competently, everything else is debatable although the slider appetizers were tasty. \n\nThe seating is super comfortable, especially the booths, which are ample and can easily accommodate 5 adults, 6 in a pinch.  We went on a Sunday night when there was no valet service and street parking easy to find.  \n\nThe service was excellent. The server initially brought out some samples of raw Wagyu beef to show us the marbling.  This was unsolicited and felt a bit like upselling, but it was harmless, as we resisted buying into the (expensive) hype. I found out later that not all Wagyu is the same, and 5A5 does not give out the Japanese rating/specs on its Wagyu beef, so perhaps it isn't the \"best\" available.  In the end, the staff was very attentive throughout and executed perfectly.  \n\nBottom line: comfortable seating, stick with American steaks, get the fries and maybe the sliders.  Other stuff is fine if you are into fusionish food or like Asian flavors with your dead cow.  Still waiting for a real steakhouse to open in SF.", "author": "Miles N."}

But when it comes to the steaks, it's all business.   They serve highest quality steaks from around the world: Angus Beef from the Midwest,  Australian F1, and their namesake, the A5 Wagyu imported from Japan which is apparently the highest grade of beef in the world. \n\nLearning this much about steak was humbling, I thought I knew a good steak when I ate one but that was kind of just like stumbling on one by accident.  There are no accidents at 5A5, you pay more (up to $20/oz) and you get a better cut of steak, period.  I was there with Todd, Alan, and Cynthia and none of us were disappointed, every bite I tried of their selections were just amazing. \n\nThe guy serving us was kind of a douche but a friendly one for the most part, he couldn't really help it.

The place was a tad bit hard to spot at first because they had no sign up yet, but luckily I had been to the old Frisson, so I knew the general vicinity.  They layout is pretty much the same as Frisson, but they touched it up a bit( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/kwng2bDfWxkVljmORRm3MA/l ).\n\nWe started off happy hour with some truffle fries( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/8NdOTQPh-69LOKaBfqDUBw/l ) and the hamachi, poke and oyster shooters( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/pvIsXLYvWY02ed9TCdD0Aw/l ).  The fries were delicious, but a bit much for two people.  I'd recommend sharing with 3 or more people if you're ordering other food...its quite filling.  The shooters were 2 for $5.  The best one was the hamachi, and we ended ordering 2 more rounds of those.  \n\nAfter we let round one of food settle, we moved into the dining area for dinner.  We started out with the beef carpaccio roll( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/9rtWkD1QaJZCz8OKWA5BTg/l ).  This was a different but very yummy version of carpaccio.  The avocado gave it a nice creamy texture, and the jicama gave it a nice crunch.  Since we were slightly filled up from the happy hour food, we decided to split the 22oz dry aged t-bone steak( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/v57P5TR9hrYDVJrxIImMvw/l ) and the mac & cheese( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/0fKyIw1JX_6z6xKWG3M_rg/l ).

The decor alone is very unique. I would have to say that this place is probably one of the top steak places I have been to next to Alexanders and Harris' but newly my favorite.\nCutting to the chase, we ordered a ton of food but only because they just had so much to choose from we couldnt resist!\n\nLet me just get it out now, but they have the BEST lychee martini I have ever tried! The menu states that its made with rum, orange and pineapple juice but it came out as somewhat of a pink color with only one piece of lychee in it. When you drink it, the lychee taste is so strong but we couldnt figure out how they got it mixed in!\n\nOyster Shooters - very different from the typical oyster shooters that we normally get at other restaurants. These had the oysters with compressed watermelon! How strange, but the taste was very appealing. The watermelon's sweetness went so well with the saltiness of the oyster.\n\nTruffle Fries - we heard good reviews about these bites so we had to try it. They were...very truffle-y. We were trying to figure out if the chefs tossed the fries in the truffle oil or if they just drizzled it over because the consistency of the truffle oil on the fries was not all too consistent. Some fries had more truffle than others. But the portion of this was way more than the two of us could finish.\n\nRibs & Chips - The ribs reminded us of something we would get at a Vietnamese Fusion restaurant. However, the meat on the ribs slid right off the bone!! It was sooo tender and the flavor of the sauce was hella good! If only we had some rice and it would be a perfect meal. The chips ended up being some kind of lotus chips which were interesting but still good nonetheless.\n\nBone In Ribeye - My boyfriend's entree, he got the sauce on the side so that i could try some of it still. He claims it was delicious with the sauce though, which it did look like it, but it was HUGE (yeah yeah thats what she said) which he ended up taking most of it to go since we were kind of full from the appetizers and starters.\n\nFilet Mignon - I got the 6oz which was perfect size because like i said, i was pretty full from the apps and starters yet i was still able to finish the whole thing and feel comfortable. I got it without the cheese which still tasted good. It was very tender but a little on the salty side.\n\nSauteed Spinach - The side of my choice, reminded me of my grandma's cooking back in the day. It was sauteed with some kind of oil and garlic, think Chinese food style. I still enjoyed it though since i havent had it cooked like that in so long.\n\nMac & Cheese - My boyfriend's choice for a side. No comment for this really, except it looked very cheesy.\n\nSorbet - Dessert!! One of the reasons to love San Francisco, almost all the restaurants have sorbet on the dessert menu!! yay for me! lol. Our was some kind of passion fruit with \"balsamic air\" on top which looked like foam. The sorbet alone was very sweet but when you ate it with some of the balsamic foam it kind of balanced it out and made it less sweet and very delicious. I tried the balsamic air by itself and surprisingly, it tasted like straight up balsamic like what you would put on a salad. It was nasty by itself yet somehow went so well with the sorbet. The fresh fruit they put surrounding the sorbet were all very ripe and sweet.\n\nWow, looking at everything we ordered, I feel like a fatass now haha, but this place is definitely one of those MUST TRIES that everyone needs to put on their To Go list for dinner choices.

The ambience is kinda nice - except for the really noisy kitchen. And guess what? We were made to sit right there, under these flashy spotlights ..not my idea of a date night. We changed tables to a quieter corner.\n\nI headed straight for the Daikon Soup - unfortunately they were out of it and suggested I order the iceberg salad. Worst salad presentation ever. Imagine, a giant iceberg lettuce chopped in half, dressing on top and that's it! How the hell was I supposed to eat this without having lettuce leaves flying off my plate? \n\nAnyway, what saved the appetizers was the Truffle Fries. Really yummy and oily in a good way :) I had my fill but had to make room for the big steak! \n\nOn to the main course - New York Strip and the Rib Eye for the man. His was okay - a bit overdone. I asked for mine medium-rare but it was a bit more on the rare side. How can a steakhouse not get this right? Im not sure why they served it with kimchi.. it formed a neat pile on the side of my plate. I wish I could say it was lip-smacking good, but it wasn't. Portion sizes were decent though.\n\nOur waitress coaxed us into ordering a side - which was really not necessary since the main course was so filling. We ordered marbled potatoes.. a really rich dish topped with cheese (ugh!) - we had two bites and requested a doggy bag.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Flan and the Chocolate Mousse. Both looked really delectable till we tasted it. Sweet as hell! I mean, come on this is not what fine dining is about.\n\nService was meh. I requested for sparkling water and the waitress doesn't even leave the bottle that cost me $10 on the table!\n\nFor a bill that was upwards of $150, I rather go to Jardinere or Agricolo, have a blast with 2 rounds of cocktails and some good ol' food prepared right. 5A5 is a place that has to many frills and this shows up on the plate too.

What drops it another star is the overhype and the general all -around disappointment of our expectations.\n\nWe had the private room downstairs for a dinner event and as a result, had a set menu (with some options).\n\nTo kick off the night, neither the hamachi nor the maguro shooters were really all that impressive.  Both were overseasoned (with either ginger and ponzu or cilantro) such that the taste of the fish got lost.\n\nNext, I went with the daikon soup for a starter (as at least that dish sounded interesting compared to either the romaine heart or iceberg salads).  The soup was the best thing I had, with satisfying chunks of hearty blue crab meat.  It even had an unexpected spicy kick that added complexity.\n\nFor entrees, I chose the 6 oz filet medium rare.  It came out medium well.  I could understand if my dish was perhaps the only one that was overcooked ... but seemingly everyone at our large table who ordered steak had theirs overcooked.  Most egregious was a rare order that came out at least medium.  \n\nIn all honesty, the steak tasted good despite the cooking mistep.  But seriously, for a restaurant that prides itself on the highest cuts of steak (even naming itself based on the highest steak grade) and a chef who is touted on its website as being one of the most knowledgeable on quality beef, how can you not be sorely disappointed by the results?  It's one thing to be off on the side of mashed potatoes but if you are shooting for the moon and claiming that you are among the best steakhouses in the city, shouldn't you at least cook them to order?\n\nInitially, I thought of cutting them some slack because it was a large private event and perhaps the meat was overcooked while waiting for the other dishes so they could all go out at once.  But then I thought they have a special private dining room for these events so they should have perfected their service.\n\nAnd then the kicker - our dessert (warm chocolate fondant with blackberry fruit and sorbet - we didn't get a selection) was incredibly dry and overcooked (is there a theme here?).  Taste like sawdust in your mouth.  Half of us didn't even bother eating ours. \n\nAnd to top it all off, it was a pricey meal (over $100 for the set menu, not taking into account drinks, which at $13 a pop, were decidedly underwhelming as well).  One positive was the service, as the friendly servers were consistently on point with filling water glasses, obtaining drink orders, clearing dishes.\n\nTo me, 5A5 seems out of place in the SF restaurant scene, which prides itself on high quality and well-executed products.  The focus in the Bay Area is on the food and the food only.  5A5 seems almost better suited for the LA scene, where people flock to see and be seen in a beautifully decorated interior and mingle among the masses.  Even at the expense of mediocre yet overpriced food.  I just don't think that is going to fly here.", "author": "F. P."}

It was kind of hard to hear the waitress, so that was a bit annoying...\n\nI came in with my family on a Saturday evening - we were promptly seated and service was good. \n\nWhat I had:\n- TRUFFLE FRIES were pretty tasty - soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. The seasoning is just right - not too salty, with a touch of garlic and parsley. You gotta dip the fries into the sauce/cream that comes with it! I'm not much of a French fries person, but it was pretty good!\n- SHROOMS had a wonderful natural aroma & taste to them. Don't get it if you don't like mushrooms/shroom taste (as many people don't), but I love mushrooms so this was fine by me.\n- TRUFFLED MAC & CHEESE was actually the only dish that I didn't quite like... The cheese was way too overpowering, and it had a certain aroma/stench to it that I can't quite describe.  I didn't quite like the texture either. For the price and portion that they give you, let's just say you're better off trying other things from the menu. I'm sure you can get better mac & cheese somewhere else.\n- FILET MIGNON (10oz, medium rare) was awesome! The meat was quite tender, and it was cooked just right.

We arrived about 20 minutes early for our 7pm reservation (having one IS necessary), and took the opportunity to have a cocktail at the bar before being seated.  The bar staff was friendly and accommodating, drinks were expertly mixed, and a few jokes told.  Perfect way to start the evening.  I even asked to try one of the port's I wasn't familiar with, and she poured a half glass without charging. Fabulous!\n\nLet me take a moment to relate on the general atmosphere of the place.  The name definitely fits.  There's a certain lounge-y feel to the place - a large single room with a slight separation between the bar tables and the dining area, but it still feels like a single space.  The dining area is very open, yet secluded enough that you don't feel like you're sharing tables.  Open enough that you can see what other people are eating, but you're not close enough to be overwhelmed by competing conversations.  The overall lighting was tasteful and dim, but the tables were well lit - no need for sunglasses or squinting to make out shapes.\n\nOur server was Shawna.  I will start with saying that after listening to her recommendations, my menu decisions were reduced to a very simple \"Yes!\"  She was incredibly descriptive and knowledgeable about the menu, and her recommendations were spot on.  At every point of the evening, she and the rest of the staff were on point keeping waters filled, wine glasses topped, and even wiping crumbs from the table. \n\nWe started off (as recommended) with the Hamachi shooters, followed by the lobster tempura and the truffle fries.  Everything you've heard about the truffle fries is true - they are crack.  The aioli that accompanies them even has a trace of truffle oil in it, making it finger-licking good!  If you try to put ketchup on them, I will hunt you down myself. The lobster was delicate and exquisite, and the shooters (basically sushi in a shot glass minus the rice - Amazing!) were a terrific palate cleanser. \n\nThe steaks were phenom.  We went with the buffalo ribeye and the bone-in filet, with sides of mixed mushrooms (chanterelle, etc) and their mac 'n cheese.  My wife is currently eating the leftover mac 'n cheese for breakfast.  Yeah, it was that good.  We also ordered the 4oz Wagyu ribeye, which was equally amazing.  Not only were all three steaks cooked to perfection (true medium rare), but the accompanying sauces were lick-your-plate good.  Let it be said that I have never tasted a better steak, anywhere.\n\nI could go on and on, but in reality you need to try it for yourselves.  The wine list is extensive and well rounded, and the entire experience makes for an absolutely wonderful evening.", "author": "Rob O."}

Nothing was overly salty (I feel that a lot of nicer restaurants have a huuuge problem with overloading on the salt), everything was cooked to perfection and wonderfully, beautifully flavorful. Absolutely freakin' heavenly.\n\nService is great - staff is super friendly and attentive, our water glasses never got a chance to get anywhere near half empty,and even the manager/owner stopped by our table to say hi and make sure we were enjoying his delicious food and beautiful restaurant (we were =) ).

The place will be nice and quiet and won't be crowded yet.  This way you can concentrate on your meal rather than the hipster-dufus crowd that will stroll in later.\n\nWe tried all the shooters and I actually liked the oyster shooter best.  We got the truffle fries out of sheer obligation but they didn't disappoint. I grabbed an order of edamame to nosh on while everyone else at the table talked over in great detail what starters we were going to order.  This was all washed down with some very well made cocktails.\n\nStarters chosen:\n\nScallops BLT - I loved it because the scallops were cooked so well\nLobster Tempura - Everyone at the table gushed over these.\nSeared foie gras - I'm a foie gras fanatic, so this never disappoints.\nribs & chips - Yummy yummy yummy\n\nIf you read any of my reviews, there's likely to be discussion of wine...and for the main course selections to be made, a wine pairing must be done first.\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you will jump for a big Cab at a steakhouse because that's \"what the book tells you to do\".  But in this case, everyone was ordering wagyu -- it's why you're here in the first place, right?  I didn't want anything to overpower the beef.  I wanted everyone to be able to taste the subtle flavor differences of wagyu.\n\nThe place has a pretty darn good list of wines available and I'm sure the hipster-dufus crowd that dines there later in the evening all jump to the only expensive wines they've ever heard of like the Opus One or the Joseph Phelps Insignia (neither of which is worth the money in my book).  But I chose the Gary Farrell Pinot.  It's a good price performer and the sweet notes in the wine (being a Russian River Pinot) would compliment the fat in the wagyu.  As far as my friends at the table were concerned, it was a great choice.  I thought so too.  (They have Justin Isosceles on the menu too, I almost chose that).\n\nWe each only ordered a 4oz wagyu cut because we had already had shooters, bites and starters.  For sides we had the mac & cheese, potato au gratin, shrooms and haricot vert.  The standout here was the potato au gratin -- wow!\n\nThis was more than enough food for us and it was all great.  I had the wagyu ribcap and I have to say of the four cuts, it was my favorite (we all tried each others).\n\nI've had real kobe beef cooked on a hot stone in Tokyo and can still say that this wagyu was very well prepared and cooked.  We all ordered medium rare, but the NY cut that my friend ordered was slightly towards the medium side, so you may want to order the wagyu NY a little rarer than usual.\n\nOverall a great meal and I'd go back again.\n\nAs we were leaving, the bar area was starting to fill up with hipsters (and I must say a few hotties) and getting louder.  So I can see how some reviews bitch about the noise here if their reservation was for the 2nd half of the evening.\n\nIn short: Go early to enjoy the food and just bite the bullet & try the wagyu.", "author": "Phil K."}

I chose 5A5 based on location, price, and reviews. We were seated promptly but had to wait a little bit for our server to show up once seated. When he did, he seemed put off by my husband asking for his steak to be prepared without certain sauces/additions on it.  It's not like he asked for ketchup or A1!  Our server actually made a visible face when my husband described what he wanted.\n\nMy appetizer was very good.  My filet was good, but not great.

I won't need to try this again (only because of how much it costs) but I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. It was overcooked but even when overcooked, was still soft and melt-in-your-mouth delectable. \nTruffled mac n cheese - delicious. I tried it with the lobster tail because it came recommended but I don't think the lobster tail added to it for me. I would have enjoyed the mac and cheese by itself. \n\nI tried the desserts and would skip them when I eat here again.", "author": "Jenn O."}

We recently moved to the Bay area and although we love to dine out regularly, we have been very disappointed with many of our dining experiences in San Francisco. While we appreciate good food, we tend to appreciate good service even more. And as a whole, good service seems to be few and far between in SF. \n\nOn Oct. 8th, Ali was our server. From the moment we walked in Ali made us feel comfortable and attended to our every need without ever being asked. We never waited for our order to be taken or for our drinks to be replenished (yay!). Ali was knowledgeable about the menu (as he should be, since the steak options are unique) and offered helpful and sometimes comedic suggestions. With the raise of a brow I knew he was skeptical about my white wine choice with my filet! But, I love my white wine and appreciated his underlying concern, but even more I appreciated that he was not stuffy with his attitude and felt comfortable enough to show us his humorous side. So many times, knowledgeable waitstaff seem distant and unapproachable. \n\nWithout going into too much detail, the food was incredible! We started with scallops and a salad, I had the regular filet, my husband the special beef filet and we ended with carrot cake and pumpkin bread pudding (wow!). There is nothing to complain about in regards to our meal. It was perfect beginning to end. The menu is priced as it should be for the quality and preparation. \n\nIn short, our dinner was fabulous, but it was even more fabulous because Ali was our server! We will return. \n\nAlso, thank you to Erik, one of the Managers on staff that night. He took the time to stop over to our table and share some insight about the restaurant and their dedication to providing excellent food and service. I hope other restaurants will take note.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

The heat from the jalapeno kicked in as a nice aftertaste.\nthe oyster however, was not good. I don't remember what type of oyster it was, because the seaweed salad on in it overpowered the oyster. also, there was supposedly some sort of champagne ice on top of it but it just tasted like water. other than that, the hamachi shot was perfect.\nnext was a salad of mixed greens, cheese, pears, and walnuts. the waiter forgot to offer freshly cracked black pepper, we had to ask. \ni'm sure this was just opening jitters and they'll work that out.\nother than that, not much can be said about a salad.\n30 day aged dry rub rib eye w/ parsnip puree and lobster tail - the ribeye was ehh okay. tender, but not quite juicy enough for me. the lobster tail was succulent though. perfect. the meat was not tough nor chewy, and the spinach was wilted perfectly.\nintermezzo - it was some shot of a fruit slushy thing that had bits of thyme in it. very refreshing.\nflourless chocolate cake w/ raspberries - MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MEAL! highly impressed w/ the pastry chef. I was told by the kitchen chef that the woman who made the pastries that night was trained at the CIA, and is getting her own kitchen at Google. NICE. She's currently training the staff at A5, so i will be expecting excellent desserts from them in the future. This is what a flourless chocolate cake is supposed to taste like. Not like that thick brick concoction at Ruth's Chris *barf*\n\nafter the dinner, we were so lucky to be able to also have SEA BASS!\nit was quite delicious and not too fatty tasting\n\n i guess you could say we really had a 6 course meal?\n\nAnd how could I forget the complimentary cupcakes! Red cupcakes w/ cream cheese frosting. They were so good but I was too full to eat one entire cupcake to myself so i split it. They were the perfect size and not topped with heaping amounts of frosting. cupcake perfection at its finest, i salute you.\n\nThey're not fully open to the public yet, so I know they're working things out.

The decor of the restaurant reminds of the ones in Vegas.  Its a great place to come for a date or to hang out.\n\nTo start off, I had the Hamachi and Maguro Shooters during the happy hour price at 2 for $5. They are bite sized teases that are very beautifully arranged in a shot glass.  With the number of items in each shot, there's a lot going on in the shooters that will mask hamachi and maguro taste.  At happy hour prices, these are very reasonable to get and fun to eat, however at regular price, I have to think carefully before ordering one.\n\nThe Truffle Fries are so delicious.  The truffle essence and the pairing of the aioli sauce works great together.  Its a must get, just be careful not to spoil your appetite as you can easily eat quite a lot unsuspectingly. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered a medium rare, Dry Aged T-Bone steak. The portions is huge! If you like bone marrow, this is the steak to get. The steak is topped off with fried bone marrow, which the physical appearance reminds me of tater tots.  Try not to eat the whole thing at once as it is super heavy, instead pair a bit of it with each bite of the steak.  If you want something that is very rich in flavor and have a serious appetite, this is the steak to get. \n\nBottom line, this is a great place to come for drinks and food.  It falls on the pricier side and you will run up a tab if you start ordering several appetizers and drinks, but the ambiance and presentation of food will surely impress.", "author": "Kinman H."}

I ordered the following\n\nHamachi Shooter - avocado and ginger... this was kind of mild. Surprisingly the avocado really creamed over the ginger so it didn't have as much kick as I would like it to have. The hamachi was a good quality\n\nTuna Shooter - soy, cilantro, and basil panko. In other words... amazing. As you can tell by my previous posts, I hate cilantro. However, the soy and basil panko added a salty/crunch flavor. I swear there was sesame oil in this too, because after shooting this, I declared it the winner. It was a blend of refreshing and zesty flavors that really open up your palate.\n\nBacon Wrapped Scallops - Bacon, scallops, and fried squash with a cocoa sauce and aioli. The bacon was surprisingly saltier  than it should have been, which sometimes tended to take me by surprise. The scallops were a perfect medium rare and were HUGE, though this did not off set the bacon by much. The smokiness from the cocoa and starchiness of the squash added a great contrast to a delicate/savory dish. I would get this again, despite it being slightly salty.\n\n22oz Dry Aged Bone In New York - a dry aged steak coated lightly in mushroom sauce and tenkasu, which is like fried tempura batter with onion flavoring. I could not believe this was a New York steak... amazing marbling... almost rib eye-ish but still a bit leaner. Still, compared to other new york steaks, this is the best one I've ever had. The steak had a nice crisp crust and was obviously grilled/fried in butter, which really seared in the flavor. The mushroom sauce was slight, and complimented the dish nicely, while the tenkasu added a nice onion crispy flavor, without taking away from the crunchiness of the dry aged meat. My only gripe... I ordered it blue rare... it came out medium rare/medium... I haz a sad for great steak being over cooked.\n\nKombucha Bread Pudding -  amazing. I wish the dessert was all kombucha bread pudding. Super custardy, with a good amount of vanilla flavoring, though not enough to overwhelm the kombucha squash flavor. The coarse chops of bread also added a nice sweet crunch. Note that the bread was more of a sweet bread, so this dish was a pure dessert instead of one of those savory/sweet ones people have been experimenting with. Wow this was good. Best Bread Pudding 2011\n\nJapanese donut - it almost was like a cake donut with a texture of fried tapioca. Kinda cold when it came out. Coated in a dark chocolate sauce.\n\nOverall a great experience. My only gripes: overcooked my steak (blue rare is the way to go, not medium... gah still sad about that), and they took forever to get our cars. But overall... great food, with decent service. I definitely will come here again in a smaller group and get something off of the regular menu", "author": "Marc T."}

The valet is quick n efficient and works hard. \n\nDidn't make reservations but I didn't think I needed to but I was wrong. Supposedly they were all booked so we sat at the bar area at a small table.

A guy, I didn't get his name but he was a very handsome white manager type guy was able to squeeze us in. But honestly, we stayed til it turned into a club and didn't see all the tables filled so not sure if they just had lots of cancellations. I brought my own special bottle of wine and they do charge $20 cork fee, which is ok. Normally most restaurants charge $15 but since it's upscale, I guess they have a right to charge more. \n\nMy friend ordered the peppers n I gotta say it wasn't my type of dish. But it's her fav n I noticed other ppl got it so I guess it's good to others. I forgot what else we ordered, but the mac and cheese n truffle oil was excellent. However, the waitress asked me as if it was supposed to be a side for my main dish, I didn't realize it was a separate dish. Same thing with my friend, the waitress asked, \"Would you like any mac and cheese or ______ with that?\" And my friend ordered a side and it was $10 for each side so an extra $20. Would have been nice if she had been more clear. Not that it mattered cause we weren't paying, but just FYI in future for other customers as that can add up.

B/c it's a lounge, it's not your typical high end steakhouse feel. Depending on where you sit, you can actually see some of the staff in the back prepare some of your food. It's kind of cool.\n\nIt's very spacious and I was lucky enough to get a big table. I didn't venture to the bar but it looked pretty nice. Not huge but nice and elegant.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it was very good. I ordered the 10 oz filet minon. I'm more of a \"NY steak\" type guy but that steak had some Asian sauces on it and I didn't feel like being too adventurous with it so I opted for a more traditional cut of meat without the extra bells and whistles. My g/f ordered the prime rib.\n\nMy steak had a maple glaze encased at the bottom with some bacon bits on top, making for an exceptional meal. I felt like if the steak had just a little more salt, it would have been killer. Nonetheless, it was a very good cut of meat.\n\nMy fiancee had no qualms about her prime rib. I'm not the biggest prime rib guy but did have a taste and it was good.\n\nAs far as sides goes, it's family style so we ordered the mushrooms and I believe Kale (sorry, my memory is slightly hazy). The mushrooms were big and had a lot of flavor. The Kale was equally tasty.\n\nThis place gets 5 stars for service. Our waitress/server was Lelia (I hope I spelled that correctly). She was very professional and was very knowledgeable about the menu. She gave us her opinions on what she liked and my water was refilled multiple times by other staff members.\n\nOh before I forget. The chef sent us two complimentary items, which always rocks. One was a palate cleanser and the other was like a gelatinous miso soup. Sounds weird but it was good. We also got some bread as well (1/2 regular and the other half with bacon bits inside). \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience.

Sometimes it's hard for us to just go out, since we both work in the industry for JB nominated/top 100 restaurants, but we really try not to be overly critical. We happened to be out in the city on our day off and realized we were getting close to missing an opportunity for dinner. So we were deciding between House of Prime Rib and 5A5. HOPR was closing soon so our decision was made for us. \n\nI get wanting to break away from the standard steakhouse format where everything is ala carte but the set on almost every steak seemed to have a million flavors going on. It was overwhelming for someone who'd been hoping for a nice ribeye seasoned with a little s&p and maybe some chimichurri or even a good b\u00e9arnaise on the side (looking for a simpler/ brighter flavor profile). The option for the boneless ribeye had pickled ginger (not necessarily a bad thing from a menu composition standpoint, but personally one of my least favorite things to eat), so I opted for the bone in. With a much heavier looking set (bacon jam and a perfect egg), I figured it'd be plated with a light hand, so everything would be balanced (maybe I'm just an idiot, idk). Felt guilty about ordering a $50 steak so I went with the cesar salad instead of a pricier app. \n\nApps were fine. Cesar was kind of bland but not terrible. Amuse bouche was bizarre. Trust me, I understand food cost but no one's forcing you, so if you're gonna do one then make it something interesting. A raw sugar snap pea, cut in half & doused in ponzu and sprinkled with sesame just feels cheap as hell. The cost on that has gotta be what, like ten cents? I don't know, it just felt weird and half-assed, instead of making us feel like there was an added value to our meal. \n\nOur steaks were where I felt the most disappointment. A massive ribeye slathered in (seriously) half a cup of bacon jam with a sous vide perfect egg. The jam was overpowering. In a really gross way. Like dumping BBQ sauce, a bottle of liquid smoke, and some bacon in a robo coupe and calling it a day. I've made bacon jam before and it was great and nuanced and delicious and I'd take like a TABLESPOON of it and spread it across a steak and it was great. In this quantity, I had three bites and was starting to feel ill. And maybe it's just me, but I wished the egg has been a hair more cooked. Not because egg yolk grosses me out or anything, but I just wish there'd been a touch more viscosity to it so I could just dip my steak in that once I'd scraped off all the bacon jam and banished it to a corner of my plate. On top of that, a rare ribeye should be pretty freakin tender but I felt like it was chewy and tough. \n\nIn all fairness, my boyfriend said his med rare boneless was great and the bite I tried was a pleasant texture so maybe I just had a weird piece. But I was so disappointed with everything else that I'd given up at that point. \n\nThe sides weren't really anything special either. The gratin had a great later of crispy cheese on top but the actual potatoes were not uniformly cut (and therefore undercooked) and either there was a purple potato variety in there or they'd been sitting in the cast iron for too long but everything was weird and grey. \n\nMy FOH issue was that if you're going to make the decision to have beige upholstery then you also need to shell out to have it cleaned regularly. Everything was grey or black on the corners and looked dingy. If I have to show up with a clean white shirt and apron, why shouldn't the restaurant also be accountable for its own appearance? \n\nI feel like a prick for leaving such an awful review (cause I know some bad Yelps can be unwarranted and getting one always sucks), but I was honestly so disappointed with spending $200 on a meal that I didn't even feel was \"good.\" Clearly the chef either isn't in the kitchen most nights and things aren't being executed correctly, or there needs to be a serious menu audit. Or maybe not. Plenty of other people seem to have enjoyed this place. Maybe my expectations were just too high. Although that bacon jam is still unforgivable.", "author": "Chloe L."}

Perhaps it's a girly drink, but I'll admit to ordering the pear spice martini and loved it.  The truffle fries weren't anything special (and seemed overcooked).

But we waited in the lounge and they served us drinks, so no biggie. The pricing is a little bit sleazy IMHO. Almost everything we ordered cost at least 10% more than on the online menu.  This is probably negligence in failing to update the web site rather than intentional bait-and-switch, but I'd still expect a nice restaurant to do better.

I said, I'm game, bring it on.\n\nWith my first bite I thought that it couldn't compare with the flavors from Japan and the one or two great cuts I have had in the US (out of dozens of supposed waygu).  After the third or fourth bite, I was like, hmmm, wait a minute.  By the time I was done I fully apprciated the texture and earthiness that the traditional beef brought to the rich and creamy waygu.  Much to my surprise, I admitted to the server that it was indeed the best steak I had ever eaten.\n\nThe F1 at 5A5 is not even in the same stratosphere as the F1 at Alexanders.\n\nMaybe they had a special cut that day, which is why the Alexander's servers were pushing it so hard.  Regardless, gotta call em as I see em.\n\nAs long as I am here, on to the rest of the review...\n\nI hear enough industry buzz that 5A5 is not really high on my list.  But, yes, I had a dreaded Bloomspot, so thought I would check it out when I was in the area one afternoon.  Went early enough that they had some pretty good happy hour food specials.  But alas, I couldn't get them in the dining room.  The server told us the computer systems were different.  A laughably lame excuse, but it allowed her to save face and us to pretend we understood.  I totally respect their decision not to serve discounted apps in the dining room, but that doesn't mean that it earns them any goodwill, especially at 6pm when the dining room is fairly empty.  And given the rest of the experience, they should be bending over backward to get goodwill from their customers.\n\nThe server, who was clearly trained to push REALLY hard to get the ticket for two north of the $400 mark, recommended the lobster tempura as the signature appetizer.   It wasn't that special at all.  It was a bit dry, and the dipping sauce was way too acidic.  On the plus side, if you do like the taste, it's quite a bargain as you get an entire lobster tail for $25.\n\nThe ceasar salad was embarassing.  Dressing was watery, and I would swear that the croutons were from a box from the Safeway across the street.  The only thing dissauding me from that notion was that every fifth one was like biting into a cube of salt.\n\nDuo of Tataki's was pretty good, but nothing special.  The fish was overpowered by the relishes.  Got a couple of sides: the shrooms were OK, I didn't really like them but my GF did, and the creamed corn was pretty good, although nothing special.\n\nThe Chawanmushi amuse bouche was the largest amuse bouche I have ever had, and it was quite tasty.  The palate cleansing grapefruit juice was amazing.  It didn't taste sweet, but however they treated it totally toned down the tarness of the grapefruit perfectly.  That was a work of art.\n\nIt is a beautiful restaurant, even if much is unchanged from the Frission days, and they have a wine list that, while it may be a bit sub-par by steakhouse sandards, was pretty decent overall .", "author": "craig F."}

Spent the boyfriend's birthday here and we were extremely pleased with our experience. The ambiance is very chic yet doesn't seem as though it's trying too hard. \n\nWe had a reservation at 7:30 and were seated instantly. Other steak houses (ahem, Ruth's Chris) make you wait 10 or so minutes even though you have a reservation so I was definitely surprised! Our waiter was more than accommodating and after telling him it was our first visit, he explained the menu thoroughly. Overall, the service was great throughout the visit and our water glasses were rarely half-full. \n\nOnto what we ate! We started with the Kobe sliders..mmm mmm. These were delicious and the beef was tender and so flavorful. We also HAD to order the truffle fries that everyone is raving about! These did not disappoint! And coming from someone who's had Belgian frites in Belgium, these were top notch fries! You could definitely taste the truffle oil but not in an overpowering way. \n\nFor our main courses, I had a 9 oz. bone in filet mignon (was not on the menu and was a special or something) and my boyfriend had a 25 oz. ribeye!! WOW. I had a bite of his but I preferred mine. Hands down, the best filet mignon I have ever had! Perfect texture, flavor, size, everything! \n\nOverall, this has been my favorite steakhouse and I'd choose it over Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, or Izzie's! I'll be back for sure!", "author": "Empee P."}

I wasnt too disapointed given that the website did mention menus were subject to change. As, a result we ordered off the Dine About Town menu.  \n\nI indeed got the fillet mignon cooked rare and it was made perfectly.  A side dish is suggested since it only comes a la carte. The beef carpaccio roll was recommended by our waiter and it was delicious.\n\nI dont typically order pea soup but this one  had dungeness crab in it which was quite enticing so I ordered it. My mistake! A huge bowl  came with a blob of something in the middle and then in was immediately filled with some mint green liquid pouring out from a tea pot. That was our pea soup with the crab in the middle. It didnt look too appetizing and the taste was \"different\". Definately wouldnt recommend anyone getting this. \n\nFor dessert,  I ordered the last pear tarte with was just awesome! Overall, the food was good but it could be better for the price we pay.

The flavor was very good, but the breading was a little to heavy for my taste.\n\nOur waiter greeted us a few moments after we were seated and explained that due to the natural disasters in Japan last year they are not able to import Wagyu A5 beef at this time.  In it's place they were offering F1 grade beef (1st generation cross of Wagyu and Australian Holstein).  These animals receive the same treatment as traditional Wagyu (sake, daily massages, etc).  Slightly more affordable than Wagyu beef but still $10-15/oz.\n\nWe opted for one of the specials, a dry-aged, bone-in Angus Filet Migon.  This was delicious and easily one of the top five steaks I've ever had.  Sides are large enough to share and the mashed potatoes were fantastic, although I wasn't a huge fan of the japanese curry gravy.\n\nFor dessert we had a chocolate mouse dessert, and they also brought out a special dessert for my wife's birthday (with a nicely scripted \"Happy  Birthday\" drizzled in chocolate on the plate).\n\nBy the time we left (around 8).  it was much busier and had more of the lounge/club feel that the decor suggested (especially near the bar in the front).

It wasn't even the best (tender/juicy/melt-in-my-mouth) steak I had ever had....though it certainly was the priciest!\n\nThat being said, the rest of the meal made me want to come back...and just avoid the wagyu.\n\nI started off with the oft-recommended hamachi shooter, and Yelp did not steer me wrong!  It's a wonderful mix of smooth avocado, slick hamachi, crunchy...something, and a bit of a bite from I think jalapeno.  Delish!\n\nI also ordered the truffle fries because I can never say no to fries.  They came in a larger quantity than I expected, so definitely plan to split the fries between 3 or more people, unless you plan on having fries for dinner! (Hey don't knock it til you've tried it)\n\nWe also got a side of mashed potatoes with melted cheddar and GLORIOUS candied bacon.  Seriously, that bacon was so damn good.  I just ate chunks of it by itself.  You really can't take me anywhere.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the \"slice\" of heaven dessert - tiramisu with coffee ice cream.  He loved it, but was \"upset\" that it was not a slice of tiramisu, as the name would lead you to believe, but instead a round piece.  Ever the comedian.  I just had a tiny teapot of white tea for $8, which seemed ridiculous to me.  That was practically the same price as the glass of wine I had!  And it wasn't even as good as my Lipton (white mango peach) at home.\n\nA word on the ambiance and service - we were greeted by two hostesses who looked like they were in high school, wearing long sweaters/cardigans over leggings.  Strange.  It was super loud (8:30pm on a Friday), with large groups and I think a bar area in the back.  Wait service was satisfactory but not impressive.  I guess I was expecting the $100/meal level service and was provided the $50/meal (if I didn't get the wagyu it probably would have been about $50) level service.", "author": "Cathy Y."}

It was like butter.  Was this even shrimp? It must have been rubbing up with the steak because it was also to die for.\n***Ordered the tataki duo. Not my kinda thing but my co-worker commented \"she almost bit her tongue\" with how good it was.\n***All 4 Wagyu. Shoot me in the eye right now with a bb gun!!! This was the best piece of meat that ever went down my throat.  And I'm not exaggerating! Wagyu beef is like eating your most prize possessed poodle.  Japan practically worships this cattle.  They get massages, eat the best foods and probably get pedicures. For pete's sake they feed them SAKI!!!!!!! As the table ate the 4 way in the particular order the waiter suggested, it was pure silence.  All you heard was mmms and nodding of the head.\n***Bone filet - OMG...is this how filet is supposed to taste???? The filet I've ordered at other places must have been the chef's belt because it was nothing like this!!!!!\n***Mac & Cheese - Excuse me is my grandmother from my father's side who is from Charleston, SC in that kitchen because this mac & cheese couldn't have been prepared by anyone other than some one who knew their sh*t!!!!!!!\n***Swiss chard - You mean to tell me I don't have to chew my swiss chard for 10 mins???\n\nAll I have to say is I was majorly impressed.

On my most recent dining visit I had the buffalo filet cooked medium rare and it was perfectly tender, lean yet very flavorful, and not gamey.  Also had some of the A5 wagyu ribeye which was excellently cooked, full of immense flavors and was one of the best steaks I've tasted.  A5 wagyu may be pricey, but worth it -- where else in the city can you get the highest grade of beef in the world (Japanese A5) imported directly from Japan.  On a previous visit I ordered the Australian F1 which I remember being excellent as well.\nThe apps and sides aren't to be completely outdone by the steaks though.  Most notably the mac n' cheese, hamachi shooters, wagyu shooters, and truffle fries.  The mac n' cheese dish with its blend of great melted cheeses and a subtle yet distinct flavor of truffle oil is simply heavenly!  One of the best mac n' cheese dishes ever!  You also have to save some room for dessert as well because they serve up some delectable treats here.\n\nThe service:  Servers are friendly and attentive.  The proprietor is very friendly and courteous as well and genuinely wants to ensure that everyone is having a good time and enjoying their meals.\n\nThe social scene:  It's an upbeat, trendy, swanky happy hour and nightlife spot.\n\nMisc.: Most weekday evening dining times are +1000 points on Open Table.

I threw my daughter a surprise engagement party on Saturday, Jan. 31, 2015.  Everything was going well until after the party was over, there were so much food left so I asked the waiter if he can pack all the food, mind you I was standing by the table so I know how much food we had leftover.  This so called waiter brought the bag over and I'm thinking he packed everything, NO he only packed the sliders.  He didn't pack the truffle mac & cheese, the salad, the shrimp tempura, bacon wrapped shrimp and steaks.  I called the next day and complained and the person who organized the party said she would look into it, then she emailed me back and said the waiter said he packed everything, then she said they believe the waiter over me.  I was so shocked to hear that.  And to think I gave that idiot waiter an extra tip, I would have taken that tip back.  He knows damn well he lied just to cover his behind.  Then the manager calls me and offers me a $50 gift card, the leftover food was more than that.....that just covers the happy hour food.  I would like to get my extra tip back.\n\nYou would think a high end steak place like 5A5 would have handled this in a more professional manner.  They know that waiter was lying they were just too lazy to look more into it and send me away with a lousy gift card.\n\nIf anyone is planning a party here make sure you check everything.  Make sure the waiter is doing his job.  And number one DON'T GIVE THEM AN EXTRA TIP!!! THAT'S ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE FINAL BILL.  I WOULD NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.\n\nIf I have a party there again I would make sure I don't have that same waiter, and would make sure when I say to pack everything that everything is in the box.

However, there were some high notes of the night. First of all, my friends and I originally came here for the Dine About Town menu, but it turned out to be Dive in Menu. You know how that starts... they just will you in. Being that there was a hand full of us, we decided to go family style. I might add, the venue was very nice and cozy. It wasn't too big, just the right size and very modern. I just have to complain that we had a 8:30pm reservation and ended up being seated almost 30 minutes later or so. Ridiculous!!! We ended up ordering drinks and appetizers from the bar, great lounge area. It was pretty good size. Okay down to business.\n\nDine About Town Menu\n\nYou can choose from the following:\nCaesar Salad: so delicious, the dressing had a zest of lemon in it \nIceberg Lettuce: didn't try, or\nButternut Squash Soup: wow, this was really good. It reminded me of lobster bisque which I love.. yum yum\n\nFilet Mignon cooked medium rare plus: It was cook to perfection and I love the glaze. Although, I have to say it wasn't the best I've tasted. The meat was tender but wasn't succulent. 3 stars\nNew York Strip: didn't try, or\nSalmon: didn't try\n\nChocolate: Yum Yum because I love dessert, basically it's mousse with a hint of hazel nut. 3 stars, or\nStrawberries: the description didn't sound too amusing, but I had to try it. This dessert was very light, can't really tell the distinguish any flavor. Tasted like strawberry shortcake but on cloud 9. Although the champagne droplets were good. No thanks 1 star\n\nCocktail\nIt was called something like fresh 5A5, I might be off, but it tasted more like a mimosa to me than anything else. It's basically champagne with chambord and vodka. Drinks here average around $12.\n\nBites\nKobe Sliders: The only thing remotely memorable was the fries, it was really good. The  meat was seasoned well, but the buns were just off. 2 stars\n\nStarters\nBeef Tataki: it also came with unagi glazed with terriyaki sauce. The unagi was good but the beef was on the dried side. 2 stars.\n\nLobster Tempura: I love lobster, a must!!! This was a great dish, can't go wrong with fried stuff. But I might add that the lobster tasted fresh. 4 stars\n\nMain\nDry Aged NY Strip Steak cooked medium rare plus: we ordered this based upon recommendation from the waiter (he was great by the way), but it was all bad... It was cook to perfection (not to rare but just the right redness), but the meat was so chewy. I didn't enjoy it at all.. 2 stars\n\nWagyu - the good stuff .. supposedly\nWorld Wide Wagyu, which came with \n-Chilean Wagyu ny: This was really good, although it doesn't melt in your mouth but had a great flavor to it. 4 stars\n- Assuie Wagyu ny: I didn't like it as much, a little bit on the dry side. 2 stars\n- American Wagyu ny: I actually like this one the best. It was more marbleized and had great texture. 4.5 stars. \n\nAustralian f1 ny: This one was really good too, very smooth. 4 stars\n\nCabassi & Rea Ribeye: At first when you bite into it, it was really soft. However, towards the end it leaves a very dry taste. 4 stars\n\nSides\nBrussel Sprouts: Way too much soy sauce, very salty: 1 star\nSauteed Spinach: Man I love spinach, it was nicely sauteed. Recommend 4 stars\nMac & Cheese: Yelpers were right, it was really good. Good choice of cheeses. 4.5 stars\nPotato Au Gratin: I'll pass, it's basically baked potato with sweet potato. 1 star.\nMushroom: very well seasoned, 3.5 stars\n\nBoy too much meat and food for me, but it was a great experience.

We instead opted for Le Colonial, a place we felt would deliver a fancier experience in all respects. How wrong we were. So unimpressed by dinner at Le Colonial, we actually told our server, \"No thanks [on dessert], we're actually gonna go somewhere else and get some more dinner,\" and ended up going to 5A5.\n\nAt 5A5, we got a cut of slow roasted prime rib and a filet of wagyu to share between the four of us (it was our second dinner, after all). Those steaks were *amazing* -- no hyperbole here -- we were blown away, raving and exchanging stupefied expressions from surprise and bliss as the delicious morsels of steak melted in our mouths. I don't like chunks of fat in my steak, so I had been turned off of the idea of the intensely-marbled wagyu; but it's a totally different type of fatty steak. Mostly melted away, what fat remained left the super tender steak juicy with a delicious flavor. So totally awesome.\n\nThen they brought us some complimentary frozen chocolate dessert -- also totally awesome! It sent us into a stupor again in the short time it lasted (seriously, probably less than 45 seconds). We immediately ordered another, and had not I fought off others' forks, it would have disappeared in 30 seconds and one of our friends that went to the restroom would have not had any of that second one.\n\nFood: 5/5\nPrice: $$$$\nAmbience: 5/5 - Trendy.

The tables and seating are set low and the lighting is also darkened like you're going to a club. Walls are lined with what looks like crocodile and python leather to give it a dark manly vibe. Our server was helpful in giving us the recommendations of what folks usually do which was just perfect for us portion-wise. \n\nI had the French A5 - I'm a sucker for any girly cocktail that has St. Germain elderflower liquer in it. I enjoyed it. My man had his Man-hattan, heehee. He thought it was good and strong. \n\nThe steak lounge did not forget about the usual rituals of fine dining... an amuse bouche did come out which was up my alley - a chawan mushi with mushroom and dashi flavor. An intermezzo palate cleanser came out later on but I think was a bit unnecessary - like a yuzu liquid drink like lemonade. It confused me a bit. \n\nFor starters, he tried the hamachi shooter and I had to try their oyster shooter. They come in small semi-ovalesque shooter glasses but was more food than a single mouthful can hold. I may have had actually almost raw oysters in mine. His hamachi was fresh, refreshing, with just enough citrus but their was a thin slice of red pepper which may have been a tad bit too overpowering and left him with a lingering heat. The oysters were small, fresh, with a gazpacho type relish with small chopped up veggies. \n\nThen we shared the beet salad with 3 different goat cheese balls covered in pepper, herbs and togarashi type powder. That was quite tasty and would be enjoyed I think by vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. \n\nAh...now for the main course. I am a big fan of ribeye so I had to order ribeye. For some reason, I had forgotten portion size in terms of what I usually grill at home but decided go boneless. It was cooked perfectly (I like it med-rare) and flavorful with peppercorn sauce with shiitake mushrooms. \n\nMy honey had the NY strip and it was very juicy and tender I had to do a double take since I'm used to NY strip being more firm. The kimchi topping went well with the meat. We had to order the house specialty for the side - truffle mac and cheese, which I thought was tasty and not overcooked pasta-wise. I had no room for dessert! \n\nBe sure to ask about the 5A5 name... reminds you how competitive the restaurant business can be! \n\nIt was a wonderful time and I'd be happy to return for a repeat \"lounge\" experience.

My party was greeted by a pleasant host and Kevin, the general manager. Both were friendly but Kevin was quite the gentleman. Although weird as it may sound, he treated us with respect and like royalty. It was weird being treated with such elegance since I definitely am not royalty.

Here's our order:\nWagyu Ribeye - amazing. flavorful and so tender. \nWagyu Ribcap - my absolute personal favorite. This was an amazing piece of meat. It came with truffle butter and it was the best steak I've ever had. Really.\nWagyu New York - Very tender and flavorful. \n\nAlthough the Wagyu ribcap was just incredible, the other two Wagyu steaks beat all the other steakhouses I've tried. \n\nWe also ordered:\nUSDA prime fillet - very, very yummy. Better than other places. \nTruffle fries - oh my goodness, so, so good.\nMushrooms - yummy!\nHamachi - smooth and yummy.\nEdamame - fresh with a slight crunch. Yummy.\nAlaskan crab - very fresh, very good.\nRomaine salad - crisp and fresh.\n\nThe food was so exceptional but the service was way over the top. Kevin checked on my party frequently and brought us \"special\" plates from the chef. I was impressed. I can't remember the names of the dishes he brought but it was very good. He also brought the chef out to talk about his dishes. Who does that for regular people? We invited Kevin to sit down with us because he really made us feel quite special. So he did and the conversation was pleasant. \nAlthough all that food stuffed us so pleasantly, Kevin brought out an amazing assortment of desserts for my birthday- even with a candle! \n\nMy next two visits were just as amazing, Kevin was there for both other times and he remembered me. He is probably the best host/manager I've ever met.\nAlthough I'd give 5A5 a 5 star review just for the food, I wish I could give the service and Kevin another 5 stars. My dining experience was more than amazing and I would definitely recommend 5A5 to everyone. I'd really like to say \"Thank You!\" to Kevin and his exceptional staff.

This steakhouse also becomes a lounge after dinner.  My first experience here was just for the lounge and had a really good time.  \n\nThen tried their food during \"Dine about Town\".  Their most memorable item?  The truffle fries with sriracha aoli.  \n\nThen Open Table had a 50% off sale so I took advantage of the deal.  Since I had been pigging out at a bbq, I hardly had room for anything.  \n\nI ended up just ordering small bites and wine.  \n\nThe Kobe sliders were so juicy!  It came with a small side of truffle fries.  But we also ordered some fries for the table.\n\nMy new most memorable dish:  The hamachi shots.\n\nThere was so many flavors in the hamachi shots.

I was excited to eat here as I have heard a lot of good things about it from my foodie friends.  The bacon bread was super yummy and got me even more excited for the rest of the meal.  The lobster tempura and the hamachi shooters were complete hits, it was a palate booster.  I like that they show you the raw wagyu and explain what is all about, I learned so much about this type of beef, also learned that A5 is the highest quality Wagyu available outside Japan.  The wagyu was everything I was hoping it would be, it was melt-in-your mouth goodness!!! The flavor was so good!  Oh and the truffle fries is also my favorite.  The wine pairing they suggested was very fitting to the flavor of the meat.  The truffle mac n cheese was rich and yummy!  For my boyfriend's Mom was not a wagyu fan but they have Holstein beef as well that is less marbled and more lean.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it a 5-star, because it was kind of loud (from bar area), a little separation would benefit the dining area. Also, the restroom could have been cool but it needs updating an a bit of separation as well.\n\nI would goback again whenever in SF.", "author": "Jhoiey R."}

It was not really what I expected for a traditional steakhouse.  Nonetheless, it was unique, modern and romantic all at the same time.  Not pretentious at all.\n\nFood - I had the Filet Mignon and my gf had the Ribeye bone-in.  My filet was cooked medium and was good but a taste of the ribeye with all the marbling was second to none.  Ribeye FTW!  With all the other high end steakhouses, the sides were priced separate from the steaks.  The sauteed mushrooms and grilled asparagus we ordered complemented the steaks well.\n\nService - The first time I came here (been here twice), the service was on point.  The server was very attentive yet not so much that our conversation at the table would be constantly interrupted.  We brought in our own bottle of wine and as our glasses needed refills while conversating, our server was always there to pour more for us.  Always a nice touch for a higher end restaurant where you want to enjoy the full experience.  The second time I came here, we had to call the server on more than one occassion to get a refill on our waters.  Like some restaurants, sometimes the service is touch and go.\n\nOverall, 5a5 is a nice modern steakhouse with good food and attentive service.

Unfortunately, I failed to see that $30 doesn't get me very far here.  Sure, you get what you pay for, but their prices seem a little atrocious...but let me go back to the beginning.\n\nA friend of mine recently broke up with her boyfriend.  Being the good friend I am, I vowed to take her out to have a good time.  Being the bad friend I am, I still am not good at sensing when people need to be taken out.  Seriously, I'm just clueless.  In any case, since I had a coupon for 5A5, I suggested we come here and made reservations accordingly.\n\nAnd then it went downhill.\n\nStrike one- coupon could only be used in the lounge area, which we were told after we were sat.  YES, I should have read the fine print, but those tables in the lounge area are not meant to eat a meal at.  Why wouldn't you honor the coupon in the restaurant?  Won't people spend more money overall if they know they are saving some?  \nStrike 2- They started moving the tables in the lounge area around (to make a dance floor or something), leaving my friend and I at our lonely little table in the middle of the floor before they finally moved us.  That moving of tables was really distracting.\nStrike 3- They needed a printout of my coupon.  Would not honor the coupon without it, even though I redeemed it through my iPhone and showed them I redeemed it.  Eventually they honored it, but I swear I had already digested my food by the time that I was able to get that sorted out.  It shouldn't be that difficult.  Not everyone owns a printer.  I know you don't want me to use the coupon twice, but making such a big deal out of it is NOT going to make me want to come back.\n\nFood- eh.  It was okay.  A little too heavy on the onions overall.\nWine- eh.  It was okay.\nFriend- Awesome.\n\nCustomer service goes a long way, and should not be the responsibility of the customer.

Actually, this is the letter I wrote to the Event Planner:\n\nI just wanted to let you know that our holiday dinner party at 5A5 last Saturday Dec. 4th was absolutely fantastic, and we couldn't be happier with our experience. Lynn provided outstanding service throughout and was wonderful to work with. She was very personable and totally relaxed under pressure, yet extremely professional and hardworking, too. All of the waiters did an excellent job keeping our glasses and plates full while remaining polite and considerate, especially considering the tight space they had to work with, and the plating was well-executed and beautiful, while at the same time very practical. You should be very proud of your staff, they really did an exceptional job. \n\nI think everyone's favorite part of the experience was the amazing food. I know that sounds obvious, but in the past that has not always been the case at other restaurants. I personally must say the T-bone was the best steak I have ever had (even compared to other steaks priced 3x as much), the shooters were a winner, the wine suggestions were spot on, the sides were all simple but well-executed, and the filet mignon and sea bass were also both extraordinary. Amazingly, the one vegetarian in our group who usually feels neglected at steakhouses was very satisfied with the meal and didn't feel left out of the experience, which is a nearly impossible feat! Even the dessert did not disappoint, though I must admit that most of us were stuffed by the time it was served. \n\nI would certainly recommend 5A5 to anyone planning a private party, and was very impressed with the food, service, and ambiance. Our company had some really memorable times together and this was exactly what we were looking for in our \"Holiday Experience\". Your restaurant will be the first to consider when we book next year's holiday party, thank you so much for your help in making this event possible, and feel free to pass this message along to Lynn and the rest of the staff at 5A5.", "author": "Chris j."}

However, at 5A5, I totally felt as though all my hard earned dollars was well spent. HANDS DOWN BEST STEAKS WE HAVE EVER TASTED.

Loved the wine pairing too- the pours were so large, we ended up a little tipsy by the end of dinner, and we were ok with that :)\n\nFantastic service as well- our server was very knowledgeable, and although this is irrelevant, he had a super deep and smooth voice that made his explanations very enjoyable to listen to!", "author": "Katie M."}

Loved the atmosphere and thought their cocktail was pretty impressing. \n\nI felt their shooters were quite unique; personally, my favorite was the Lobster shot. As for the starters, the Kobe Beef Sashimi should NOT BE MISSED !! (it was so yummy but sucks that since it was weighted instead of the count in pieces,  we only had 5 piece while it was 6 of us...) \n\nHowever, thought their main courses was just a okay... The Boneless Rib-eye Steak, was too salty; which when its compared to the T-Bone, the T-Bone is somewhat better. Yet, although I felt that their New York Steak was very yummy, but it's just way too unhealthy (and oily). Also, we ordered too much of the sliders... although Mac & Cheese was strongly recommended, but still, thought it was too salty and unhealthy as well; and it tasted just like their Truff Fries. In addition, my friends seems to all enjoyed their Mash Potato which came with the Curry (which I didn't try it because I was too full) while I enjoyed the Mushrooms the most (but it doesn't taste good at all once it's cold)\n\nAnyways, I think this place may just be good for some light drinks along with their shooters and starters, but not so great for the main courses.", "author": "Wei H."}

First, I should mention that the space is wonderful. The dining area is round, with an open kitchen, and makes up about half the restaurant, while the other half is dedicated to the bar area. When I walked in, I was definitely feeling the space, and hoping the food would match. \n\nAfter looking over the menu, we settled on a few shooters, and a side to accompany the Dine About Town menu. The shooters were beautifully presented, but didn't feel complete. There was something definitely missing, maybe citrus, we just knew they weren't perfect. This trend continued throughout the meal, with each course. Each one lacked something to take it to the next level. \n\nOverall, a disappointing experience in the food category because I expected so much from a place. I should mention that our cocktails were masterfully put together. If I do return to 5A5 in the future, I will stay away from the dining room, enjoy a few cocktails, and half priced appetizers in the bar area.", "author": "David M."}

I came here for lunch today and I was impressed with the quality of food that came out. My last visit here was dismal but that was for dinner and there was probably some opening day jitters. \n\nI think they finally got it down.........for lunch at least. \n\nCame here with a party of 8 for their new lunch menu. Yes, they are opened for lunch now. \n\nCeasar salad \nIt was good. I think the portion can be a tad bit bigger but it was good. You could have this with chicken, flank steak, crab, etc. for an additional charge. I think if you were just to order this as your lunch then you would definitely need to add a protein. \n\nKobe burger \nThe first time I had it here was sub par but this time it was different. It was seasoned well, had some texture to it, think they have a new onion bun now, and you can add accompaniments to it. My friend had the Italian cheese with truffle oil and my gawd, it was fantastic \n\nmac and cheese \nTasted more like an Italian pasta dish with white sauce with American cheese vs. the southern style mac and cheese. The flavor and essence was all there but I like my mac and cheese in the broiler where it gives you that layer of crust on the top. I had a friend that loved it and I had a friend that didn't like it. Preference I guess. \n\nbacon and cheese mashed potatoes \nYou really can't go wrong with bacon. The mash was silky smooth and the cheese and bacon on top was awesome. I really loved this side dish. \n\nchicken sandwich \nMy friends had this dish and didn't get to try it but they said it was juicy and good. \n\nHalibut \nAll I remember that my friend said about this dish was that it was too small. He finished his dish in probably less than 5 minutes and wanted to order another dish. \n\nOverall, it's a great place to come to once in a while.

I feel that this place, in accordance with my experience tonight, is worthy of at least 4 stars. I give it 5 for my night. \n\nWe arrived and were promptly greeted by the hostess who sat us down right away. After being seated, our kind and very easy on the eye server gave us some water, went over the menu, opened our wine, and brought us bread. \n\nTaking into consideration the server's recommendations, along with what caught our eye we ordered the following: \n\nOyster shooter \nHamachi shooter \nDay Boat Scallops \nFilet Mignon \nPrime Rib \nBok Choy with Bacon & Macadamia nuts \nMashed Potatoes \n\nThe shooters were to die for!!!! I had the oyster shooter with compressed watermelon and shiso. Heaven in one mouthful. Giancarlo had the hamachi shooter, which he described to be as equally amazing. \n\nThe day boat scallops were prepared perfectly. I loved the addition of the fennel seeds along with the cooked fennel...never knew they were such a great compliment to scallops -will try at home! However, I would say that although the crispy prosciutto that came on top sounded scrumptious, it was overly crisped, a little sweet, and upon eating my second scallop, seemingly unnecessary. The rest of the flavors were so spot on that I didn't really mind. \n\nAfter the perfect amount of time had passed after finishing the scallops, the entrees arrived and they were gorgeous. Everything looked beautiful and tasted even better. My filet mignon was cooked to my personal perfection of medium as well as my boyfriend's prime rib. The sides were also lovely...the bok choy was flavorful and the bacon and nuts added great texture. The mashed potatoes were wonderfully light and creamy...HOW do most great steakhouses get them like this!!!!??? Can someone please share this secret with me. We normally would order dessert but we were very, very full and still finishing our bottle of Cabernet (fyi the corkage fee is $20). \n\nI think that this place is fabulous. The food, most importantly was outstanding. Everything tasted great and I love love love the menu...creative, trendy and delicious. The service was great... prompt and just the right amount of attentiveness. The atmosphere is unique, hence the \"steak lounge\" title...it kind of makes me feel like I'm in New York; it has a club like feel, trendy but still high end, with consistently cool beats playing in the background and lounge/club-like decor. \n\nI really really enjoyed 5A5...I hope that their Yelp rating improves!!!

Very nice. \n\nLoved the ambiance of the place and the food. Only cons was a little bit of a wait time for the food to come out and the fact that the steaks just came out as steaks on a plate with nothing else unless you ordered a side. I guess I'm just used to steak places that come with a least a little bit mixed greens on the side or some kind of a garnish.. herbs? Veggies?

We were able to find parking about a block away! Since we arrived earlier than our reservation time, happy hour was still going on in the lounge. For happy hour, we order Oysters on the Half Shell. I felt like I've had better oysters elsewhere. After happy hour, the hostess escorted us to our table. We were given some complimentary bread - regular and bacon bread. The bacon bread was pretty good. For appetizers, we ordered the Romaine Heart Salad and the Clam Chowder. Nothing too fancy about the appetizers. In between our appetizers and main entrees, we were provided with some sort of pulled pork dish to try. It was really yummy, soft, and chewy. We had also ordered Wagyu Sliders as an additional item to try, which was not part of the Dine About Town menu. The sliders had a side of sweet potato fries. It was so tasty and you can really taste the quality. For our main entrees, we had the Boneless Ribeye and New York Strip. I loved the Boneless Ribeye, which I asked for it to be cooked medium-rare. The ribeye was very tender and cooked perfectly. It basically melted in my mouth! After our entrees, we were given lychee flavored palette cleanser. This was quite interesting and yummy. For our desserts, we had the dessert trio, plus we were given more complimentary small dessert bites. For the price we paid, it was definitely worth it!

I checked open table to see if I could book a slot, but they were all filled. I decided to take my chances anyways. We got there, and the place was about half full, but they were able to find us a table!\n\nSeated right next to the kitchen, we were welcomed to 5a5 by our server who ran us though the menu. The menu itself was simple, and short. She gave us a few of her personal favorites and gave us some time... and more time, to decide on our dishes (apparently I'm indecisive).\n\nFor starters we decided on the hamachi and salmon shooters. The hamachi was good. Fresh and smooth and worked well with the avocado, ginger, yuzu tobiko, and ponzu. The salmon shooter was different, it had some zing to it. It was accompanied by shiitake, green onion, kabayaki, and red radish. This was very refreshing.\n\nNext I we had the truffle fries with sriracha aioli and truffle oil. The fries were great. Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. My friend couldn't stop eating them! the sriracha aioli was a great addition - subtle, but nice.\n\nOur main dishes consisted of:\nAustralian f1 \"kobe\" steak (8oz). My friend ordered this, but it was originally the dish I wanted. She ordered this medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I had several bites of this dish and it melted it my mouth - very tender and juicy. I would order this for myself next time! My friend did mention that there was too much \"sauce\" for her liking (which overwhelmed the flavor of the meat a bit).\nDry aged bone-in filet (9oz with bone, 7oz without). Another great piece of meat. I ordered this medium rare and it was cooked fairly well. Slightly over done on a small portion, but was negligible. Tender and juicy for the most part.\n\nFor dessert we shared a red velvet cake with cheesecake ice cream. Moist and dense were the first two things that came to mind. Came with a spread of chocolate and a dab of mint syrup. Nice dish to finish off a salt driven meal, but nothing epic about this dessert.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this place very much. It had a relax mood/atmosphere due to the lounge/bar area near the front. I can see why people would want to come here after work for happy hour.

But, the meat was cooked the way I ordered it and the cut of meat was very good, but I feel like the meat itself was under seasoned. Maybe because it came with a bone marrow sauce (but it wasn't impressive). It also came with 3 little pieces of marrow croquettes which is best eaten in little bites with the steak. The dish overall was good.\n\n            Dry aged NY strip Steak: Ordered medium rare, it was tender and juicy and seasoned well.

So basically, we don't know if that was the bottle we ordered.  Secondly, since she took the bottle with her somewhere, we can't see the cork as well.  If the cork is broken when she tried to open the wine that means there's a possibility the cork has an unsightly or even moldy cork.  And lastly, if the cork was broken during the time the wine was open the wine should be on the house.  Well, this restaurant definitely don't have enough experience in the wine area.  \n\nThen comes the starter the hamachi shooter which I thought was a bit too sour that over powered the hamachi itself so I couldn't really taste if the hamachi was fresh or not.  The truffle fries was over cooked/fried to a point I couldn't taste the potato as it was too crunchy.  The seabass had a bitter taste to it.  Everyone on the table tried the seabass and agreed.  The A5 experience was not my forte.  The marble on the A5 Wagyu was too fatty for me.  The only A5 Wagyu I liked was the filet, the leanest part of the A5 Wagyu.  The filet was like a piece of meat that melts in your mouth even better than filet mignon.  Everything else is like eating fat with no beef flavor.  Many people might enjoy it more than I do, maybe just me as everyone has their own preference.  The portions on the sides and the desserts are extremely small for the price.\n\nAll in all, we came here to try the A5 Wagyu experience so can't really complain.  just know to order only the A5 Wagyu Filet next time.  The service was professional except for the wine part.", "author": "C W."}

The staff is quick and friendly. \n\nOrdered\n \nSTARTER:  \n-Lobster Tempura w/ sweet & sour shiitake dipping sauce: You get a tempura lobster tail. Tasty but not special enough for the price ($23).  \n\nENTREE: \n-Colorado Lamb Duo: Includes lamb chops & loin, cranberry gastrique, shiitake spring rolls. Sadly the loin was over done. I ordered it med rare and it came out med well. The lamb chop was done prefectly . The cranberry gastrique was with the meat. The shiitake spring rolls seemed to be missing something. It literally is bits of shiitake in a roll. If there was something else in the roll, I couldn't taste it because it was so salty. \n\n-Slow Roasted Prime Rib: Delicious, juicy and larger serving then most of the other entrees. It had garlic & mustard rub with au jus. \n\nSIDES: \n-Mac & Cheese: The simple comfort food made with gruyere, mozzarella, and cheddar. Soooo yummy. \n\n-Shrooms: A mushroom side dish of maitake, golden enokitake, eryngii, honshimeji, sherry wine and garlic. \n\nDESSERT\n-Fried Cheesecake: It was crispy but the cheesecake flavor I felt like it was a hint too salty.\n\n-7degrees of Chocolate: I wasn't expecting much, but it really blew me away.

I was dressed in jeans and felt a little awkward. there isn't a required dress code, but it is a dressier environment.\n\nI was kind of disappointed after looking at the menu, not much on it really grabbed me. We ended up ordering : Lobster tempura for appetizer, Kobe Sliders, Filet Mignon, and Mashed potatoes.\n\nLobster tempura was so good! It was 23 dollars,but worth it- it was tasty. Kobe sliders were fine, but nothing special. My husband said his steak was decent, but nothing special either. Mashed potatoes were kinda gross , they were watered down and bland. We wanted dessert but were afraid we would be disappointed with that too, so didn't order anything.\n\nOverall it's a very fancy looking place, that lacks in fancy food. Our bill was about 100 dollars, and we agreed we would rather have gone to a Chain steak restaurant than here! Such a bummer. We won't be back.", "author": "Kar K."}

They also have a great bar area and looks to be a great happy hour spot. \n\nWe came for dinner however, and were eager to try the special wagyu beef. This is not a place to go if you are pinching pennies. At about 20 bucks an ounce you are hoping that this will be a quality and cut of meat better than you have experienced. \n\nHubby and I ordered the much-raved-about truffle fries with sriracha aioli. They were delicious, although I found the truffle oil to be slightly overwhelming towards the bottom of the bowl. \n\nWe ordered two sides to share with our meal. The haricot vert-or string beans-with prosciutto and feta were yummy, although the server who brought it out said it was pancetta. Typo on the menu or did they run out of prosciutto? The mushroom side was good but a little plain for my husband's taste. It did pair very well with the meats which let's get down to it!\n\nI ordered a 4 oz. Wagyu filet and hubby had 8 oz Wagyu ribeye. Both were outstanding. My filet had a thin tasty garlic sauce which was requested because it was the only gluten free sauce. I found it good but salty.  And I'm usually one who likes to pile on the salt! My husband wondered why they would doctor up such wonderful cuts of meat. Wouldn't you want to keep it simple so as to taste the flavor of the Wagyu meat better? Good point. \n\nEnjoyed the meal but probably will not come back for dinner. It was pricey but more than that, the wagyu beef was prepared with sauces which masked its true flavor. I would probably come back for happy hour though.", "author": "Rosie S."}

I had a wonderful caeser salad with anchovies (if you've read my reviews lately, you know I'm a fan of these little fishies) and even ate them off my friend's plate too. The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and pretty small but maybe that just keeps you from super overindulging? For dessert, I ordered the banana cream tart.

The first thing you notice is the great ambience of the restaurant.  There is a classy feel with a nice warm touch.  I ordered the Caesar salad as an appetizer, the filet mignon with mac and cheese as a side.  \n\nOne word to describe each dish . . . delicious!  The salad was perfect as it refreshed the palate and stimulated my taste buds to prepare for the entr\u00e9e.  The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and it was extremely tender.  The mac and cheese was not bad either!  I definitely left the restaurant satisfied and full!  \n\nIf you're wondering how their happy hour is . . . it's GREAAAAT (as Tony the Tiger would put it).

Seeing the rest of my party by the bar, we started there and then found a table in the lounge area before the plac started filling up. If you're thinking of going here for happy hour, I would recommend arriving by 5:45pm or else seating may be limited. \n\nFood Ordered:\n- Hamachi Shooters- Ok, but Alexander's is still the best- 2 for $5\n- Poke Shooter- I actually liked these better than the hamachi- 2 for $5\n- Truffle Fries- I prefer them skinny rather than the fat fries they served here and the truffle oil on them was almost non existent but the dipping sauce was great- $5\n- Beef carpacio roll topped with avocado with jicama inside- definitely interesting, I loved the different textures but in terms of flavor it was just ok for me- $5\n- Chicken Yakitori Skewers- Dark meat chicken on skewers in a sweet sauce topped with green onion- very flavorful!- $5\n- Diver Sea Scallops topped with pancetta- 4 for $14- delicious but if you know me I'm a huge fan of seafood so seafood+pancetta, I'm all for it!\n\nDepending on the day you go, they have some different specials, yesterday was $1 Oysters, with a minimum of 6. Unfortunately we were way too full to order any but the table next to us ordered some and they looked delicious so I'll have to try them next time I'm there.

A lot. It was pricey for $45 but it was a 25oz steak, so hubby and I shared one and still had a chunk to take home with leftover mac n'cheese which hubby says was the best mac n' cheese, $8,  he's ever had in his life. \nThe steak was wonderfully seasoned with a demi-glace' and our waitress offered more sauce for it, but we declined.  It was tender and cooked med rare.  Jr. Yelper's bone in NY steak $45, was much leaner and didn't have as much flavor & because it was also 25oz, 1/2 of it had to be taken home too. \n\nI shared a Caesar salad which was really nice with 2 curls of anchovies!  Long stems of the lettuce placed on the plate with ample Parmesan cheese.  The hamachi shooter came as 2 small chunks of hamachi at the bottom of a shot glass filled partly with a fluid and had a soy-sauce flavor.  It was expensive for $4.  Hubby wouldn't order it again but I would.  He sampled a pineapple/pear cocktail which was OK.  \n\nThe truffle fries were spectacular and just  as good if not better than the fries at Frjtz.  The truffle oil was infused into the fries which were wonderfully crispy and came in a big bowl with dipping sauce.  \n\nBut, after eating the truffle fries and heavy truffle flavored mac n' cheese, I felt rather \"truffled out\".  We did force ourselves to have dessert.  I tried the coconut leche cake, $8, was a moist white cake with very lightly sweetened whip cream, sprinkled with coconut, \n and granita bits  with a scoop of ice cream that tasted like soap.  I kid you not.  I made hubby & Jr. Yelper eat have a taste and they confirmed it tasted like soap.  Hate to say it but Safeway makes a Tres Leche cake and sells a square for much less and it tastes better.  \n\nJr. Yelper tried the Oolong tea donuts.  A light, sugar coated dish \nwith 3 donuts and one donut hole and ice cream.  It was good but you could do just as well at Krispy Kreme.  Hubby had the citrus dessert.  A sm shot glass of citrus soda, a 2 inch mousse and 1 inch citrus cake.  The portion was so small that a toddler would've consumed that and still ask, \"Where's the dessert?\"  It was so tart that I puckered with each taste.   A very nice touch was when they brought Jr. Yelper's donut dessert dish with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the edge with a lit candle next to the writing. \n\nThe lounge is very hip with ultra modern decor.  A bar is in the front of the restaurant.  We had a booth table which was comfy but oddly, the tables were much higher than the seats and we found ourselves dining awkwardly.  It was not ergonomically correct. I felt like a kid who needed a booster chair.   You could tell the wait staff had a hard time collecting our dishes, placing our utensils between courses and filling our water glasses.  The tables were large squares making the reach for everyone difficult.  \n\nThe menu has a section of high priced meats and you can get a sampling of different Kobe type meats (Japanese, American, Australian) for $120.  I over heard the customer behind us remarking that the Japanese Kobe (the most expensive cut) was much richer tasting.   I've had Japanese Kobe at Yoshi's before and didn't find it was any richer than American Kobe.  It's all in the palate.  \n\nUnlike other Yelpers, we didn't experience bad service.  There was a longer wait from the salad/appetizer course to our entree but our server forwarned us that it would take a bit longer to cook the meats.  Overall a nice dining experience.  I'd come for the meat, fries, hamachi shooters, mac n' cheese and skip the dessert.  \n\n'", "author": "Ry T."}

Since we had such a large party, they seated us in a private room, which was nice and quiet.  Our waitress attentive throughout our whole dining experience - notified us of the specials, explained the menu options, and checked on us at appropriate times.\n\nMUST TRY!!!\n- Lobster Tempura -  this was one of my favorite dishes!  The tempura batter was light, crisp, and had tons of flavor.  \n- Boneless Ribeye (Medium) - cooked to perfection!  I shouldn't have lathered the green peppercorn sauce (which I thought looked like wasabi) that was plopped onto my steak though.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.  Nonetheless, I wiped most of the green gunk off and everything was A-OK! :D\n\nSHOULD TRY: \n- Truffle Fries - one of the better appetizers of the night.  Although it is not the best I have ever had, I would recommend ordering these if you're a french fry or truffle fanatic.\n- Mac & Cheese with Truffle Oil - similar to the truffle fries, this dish was good, but nothing spectacular.   The reason why I placed this dish in the should try is because I love truffle and the truffle oil adds a nice touch to the dish.\n\nCOULD TRY:\n- Chicken Yakitori - unless you love sushi ginger, I would steer clear of this dish.  While the chicken was moist and tender, the ginger dominated the dish (literally).\n- Crimini - nothing special, shouldve opted for the Shrooms.\n- Mashed Potato with Japanese Curry - My bf and I were so excited to see mashed potatoes with Japanese curry on the menu.  We love potatoes and Japanese curry, so we had to try this.  Not a big disappointment, but we definitely could've gone without this dish.

The side of potato au gratin was good, but the choice of mushrooms or the seasoning seemed out of place.  To be fair, our server recommended different sides.  Maybe we should have taken his advice!  \n\nDesert was \"breakfast after dark\" and \"liquid chocolate\".  Both fun and delicious.

Traveling as a cripple is indeed no way to travel, but when you're effortlessly being wheeled around in your taxi-chair, life at crotch level isn't so bad.\n\nJust as I had feared, our long voyage from the hotel to the restaurant was ridden with stairs, steep inclines, uneven pavement, and other handicap enemies (San Francisco might be the least friendly cripple city), but what I wasn't prepared for was face planting into the pavement.\n\nAnyway, despite all the fun I had on the way over, dinner at 5A5 was a welcome respite from the surly streets. \n\nFor those who care about handicapped access at 5A5, I assure you, they're handi-ready. An elevator leads to their unisex bathroom downstairs, a ramp curls around the side of their dining room leading to the back dining room, and the staff quickly accommodates to your disabled needs.\n\nThe iceberg wedge, NY strip, and banana tart was a bona fide trio.

My seabass was ok but a lot of complaints by the others.

My boyfriend and I chose to go here for his birthday dinner and it was one of the best birthday dinners I've ever had. \n\nWe made a reservation, showed up on time and were seated promptly after we arrived. The decor was very chic and appealing, in addition to the many tempting items on the menu. He chose to order the Blood & Sand cocktail, which started us on the right foot. I hate scotch and the drink tasted wonderful. \n\nThe server (who had been with the place since it opened - mega bonus) recommended we order a few of the smaller \"bites\" alongside their specialty, steaks, and sides. Before our appetizer arrived, a busser brought by an amuse bouche of gazpacho, which I usually don't favor. However, it was nicely flavored and the crunch of the veggies inside definitely amused my bouche. \n\nMy Maguro shooter came alongside our Chicken Yakitori, which both were prepared and presented perfectly. They only left me hungrier for our actual meal, a 6oz. Filet and 9oz. Filet Special with bernaise sauce. Both were cooked the way we had asked and seasoned just right. I was previously vegetarian for three years and I ate the entire steak.... and then some of my boyfriend's. The mac n' cheese and creamed spinach sides were the icing on the cake.

Only a couple tables available for bar seating otherwise standing room only. Unfortunately HH specials are not available once you're seated for dinner, probably because the dining room is relatively small, but total bummer.\n\nWe were a party of 5 and had a reservation so seating was quick and our server was great. They take a lot of time to explain the menu and make suggestions which is helpful. Luckily we were a group, so I could try a little of everything. FAVES: lobster tempura, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes (could live with less bacon), potato au gratin. I also tried a cheese-stuffed chicken dish and the filet mignon for main courses, both were great, but I'm a sides person, so those were my favorites and they were yummy!

A good chef and turn costco rib eye into awesomeness and not have to spend a gold mine to enjoy it. That said, the lounge has got more of a chill feel to it. The only negative to this place is the narrow ass hallway between the bar and the circular lounge. This is part of the lounge is spilled drink on dress central.

Our server offered great suggestions.\n\nWe got our waters in a timely fashion along with their bacon bread (bacon makes everything better, but this time it was OK).  It was a bit dense (I like my bread fluffy/porous).\n\nWe ordered:\n\nEdamame-tasted like it was sauteed with some garlic and was covered with a yummy sauce.\n\nTruffle fries w/ sriracha aioli-truffle oil, sriracha.....that won brownie points already.  The fries were prepared nicely where they were not soggy or overly fried.\n\nBuffalo steak 6oz.-nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Not the usual buttery buffalo steak that I'm use to at Ruth Chris, but delicious in it's own way.  It was accompanied with mouth watering creamy goodness (croquettes), but I wish there were more!  \n\nFilet mignon-tender, and melted in my mouth.\n\nF1 Kobe (style)-not actually from Kobe, so we already knew it was not comparable to our experience in Kobe, but it was still pretty good.  Not as buttery as we'd like, but the meat was tender and nicely seasoned. \n\nSides:\n\nMac n Cheese-creamy goodness that was not overly thick and didn't give me a heavy feeling after eating it.  It had the right texture and the mac was cooked perfectly.\n\nMash with applewood bacon-I drooled when the dish arrived.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the big chunks of applewood bacon that topped the mash.  The mash was creamy, light and topped with a layer of cheese.  The bacon was sweet and savory.\n\nSauteed mushrooms topped with saffron-not our favorite.  It had a bitter bite at the end and a little salty for our palates.\n\nWine: 2006 Dierberg Pinot-light floral bouquet, elegant and well developed body.  It was the perfect pairing where it didn't overpower the food, and went well with everything we ordered. \n\nCocktails:\nPear & Pineapple-nice balance of flavors.  You can taste and smell the pineapple and pear and it wasn't too sweet.\n\nCool cucumber-just the way it sounds.  Cool, and refreshing cucumber flavor.  \n\nSweets:\n\nRed Velvet Souffle-I loved the fact that the server popped the souffle and then slowly poured the cream cheese sauce over it.  It was light and decadent.\n\nVanilla toffee bread pudding-we were skeptical at first when the server mentioned that it was topped with vanilla salt, but it was pure bliss!  and of course the malt vanilla ice cream just topped it off.\n\nAfter dinner we stayed for a few more shots.  The bartenders were friendly and quick.  The music was ok, I was surprised to hear some of the \"older\" songs.  It had a nice crowd, but still enough room to walk around and lounge in their comfy booths.  It was a very well ventilated lounge (unlike some other lounges I've been to).  The restroom was a bit odd at first because the doors look just like the wall, but the staff was very polite and opened the doors for everyone.

I walked in and did say \"the bar is beautiful\" and then I realized it is the dinning area.  It is a very unique dining experience (in the positive sense).\n\nThe food was well plated and extremely warm (not hot as great food should never be served hot so you can really experience the flavor).  \n\nHe did say there have been some new wait staff so they are getting them up to speed -- which does take time so I take my strike back on server.\n\nIn fact, there should be no real \"strikes\" against this place - I really did like it quite a bit.  I was just hoping for a little more intimacy with my date.

Ok - don't go here if you don't have the cash and don't go here expecting to have cheap Wagyu beef.  There's no such thing unless you want a fake.  This was the real deal baby.

I had originally made reservations in December 2010 to have dinner here before watching Beach Blanket Babylon in February 2011 as a special Valentine's Day date night. However, two weeks before the event, the restaurant canceled my Wednesday night reservations without a reason. I called the restaurant and received no call back. I attempted to make another reservation, but decided to eat elsewhere for the show...\n\nSo fast forwarding to March 8, Mardi Gras. What a perfect place to eat up all the meat you can before giving it up! We made a new reservation and finally stuck with it. \n\nThe restaurant got full redemption of the reservation ordeal when server paid attention to my reservation notes and offered a Beef Tataki appetizer to make up for the mishap. It was refreshing to see that they had paid attention, and went out of their way to correct the situation at the moment.\n\nWe started off with oyster shooters with compressed waternelon. Though the watermelon was nice and refreshing, it made it hard to put everything in the shooter to slide out into my mouth. The flavor was good, and I may have tasted more of the watermelon than the oyster.\n\nWe ordered the Australian Wagyu cut with toybox tomatoes, and added the seared foie gras, the 10oz. prime rib and a side of the sauteed spinach. We are familiar with Wagyu beef, having eaten at the Meat & Wine Company in Australia. And that beef just melts in your mouth. The Wagyu cut we had here was no different. The prime rib was served in two slices in the au jus, and the horseradish on the side. The edges were nicely crusted in spices and salt. We paired the meal with the P\u00e9ju Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nWe finished the meal off with the their mini apple pie. The apple pie was a mini personal pie, butterscotch foam, candied walnuts and lemon gel\u00e9e.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-07", "description": "Took advantage of the Dine About Town deal that was going on here and glad I did.  I was a bit skeptical about an Asian-fusion steakhouse because I am one of those people who wants to enjoy the quality of the steak (i.e. eat it plain with just some salt), rather than have it all dressed up with toppings and what not.  Onto the review...\n\nThe menu here is just like any other steakhouse you might visit with all the entrees being a la carte, family style sides, and prices that make your wallet a few ounces lighter upon finishing.  I already knew I was going to do the dine about town, but I always like to see what else they offer just in case I am extremely amazed and would come back here without the deal.  \n\nFor my dinner that night, I had the daikon soup, rib eye steak, and the chocolate mousse.  The daikon soup was preceded by an amuse bouche, which was something with shitake mushroom (it was 2 weeks ago and now I have forgotten what it actually was).  Whatever it was that I ate was very good.  I could have had a whole cup of that stuff.  Not to be outdone, the daikon soup I tried is now on my list of best things I have ever eaten. Big chunks of blue crap, creamy texture for the broth, it was delicious!  \n\nNext, we got a palate cleanser, which was a citrus sorbet.  Just a tablespoon, not much, but just enough to do the job.  And now time for the main course.  As far as the cooking and done-ness of my steak, 5A5 did an excellent job.  I always test steakhouses by ordering my steak rare.  Some places get it right and some places give you a piece of beef that tastes like it just came from wherever they store the meat.  5A5 got it right.  My ribeye was rare, seared well on the grill (oh yeah, 5A5 grills their steak as opposed to the broiler used at Ruth's Chris, Alexanders, etc.), and had great flavor.  I ended up scraping the peppercorn mushroom sauce off the top and ate it as a side order because I felt like the mushrooms were a bit overpowering for the steak.  I was also able to sample the new york strip which was marinaded in kalbi sauce and covered in kim chee and pickled cabbage (?).  This steak was a bit disappointing.  I am assuming that 5A5 uses high quality beef, but after marinating it in the kalbi sauce, the steak did not taste too different from regular steak you could buy at the store.  Sure it was aged well, since it was also prepared rare, and did not bleed, but the flavor of the sauce was just too much for the steak.  \n\nOur sides were the truffle fries and \"shrooms.\"  Skip the shrooms unless you really love mushrooms and order a double portion of the fries.  The fries are among the best I have ever tried.  They taste double fried, which is crucial if you want crisply fries for the entire basket.  The siracha aioli it comes with is also very good.\n\nFor dessert, I tried the pistachio cake and the chocoalte mousse (we shared).  They were both good, but nothing spectacular.  The hazelnut cream you get with the chocolate mouse is delicious.\n\nOverall, I would probably not come back here again unless I had another deal similar to what I had.  If I am going to pay top dollar for steak, I'd rather go somewhere where the steak's flavor isn't masked by a sauce or topping.  That being said, the food was very good and the service was even better.  It's just not my type when it comes to steakhouses.", "author": "JP T."}

As long as it's cooked well and the beef is high quality (even vampires don't like e. coli), it usually doesn't matter if I'm in the old-fashioned steakhouse with the wood panels, dimly-lit rooms, blue blazers and bartenders / wait staff with moustaches stretched to their ears.  Back in high school, I remember the Sizzler days when we would enjoyed our steak that would probably bounce off the floor, complemented by numerous salad bar trips when only one person actually had salad bar privileges.\n\nI used to come here when the space was occupied by Frisson.  The food was good, but I always liked the lounge area more than the fare.  The lounge and dining areas remain trendy, with lots of modern fixtures, furniture and UFO-type lighting.  The ceiling lights in particular remind me of a UFO underside, almost like a heat lamp searing into my wallet.  \n\nIt's worth it to come here for the headliner - the A5 Japanese Wagyu beef, which is supposed to be among the best in the world - but it does not come cheap.  The sampler was a winner.  This was the World Wide Wagyu, which included 4oz Japanese A5, 4oz Australian and 4oz American \"kobe.\" There definitely is something to be said for the taste of beef from cows that are treated well - this means no cramped conditions, and cows that are grass fed and not overloaded with hormones.  I'm not sure if it's an urban legend that these cows are even massaged.

We came on a Monday and they were offering 50% off most wines, so we had a bottle of Fogdog.  For appetizer, I had the hamachi shooter which was delicious, I loved the mix of textures and flavor in this simple yet creative dish.  \n\nAfter that my bf and I shared the beef tataki with unagi which was also an interesting dish since I never had them together.  The combination was surprisingly tasty and I was enjoying each bite of it.  The tataki was extremely tender and flavorful, it was probably one of the best quality beef tataki I've ever had.  So far so good, we continued our meal with a third appetizer which was the scallop blt.  The scallops were fresh and cooked perfectly, another well executed and flavorful dish.  By then I was really looking forward to my seared foie gras, however, this dish ended up being a disappointment.  The foie gras was unfortunately overcooked.  I wanted to send it back but my bf said forget it since we both already took a huge bite out of it.  So that dish kind of ended our \"mmm and nom nom noms\"...until our aussie wagyu came out.  The steak was delicious!  It was cooked perfectly, topped with a delicious sauce and some sweet toybox tomatoes.  I'm so glad that my bf and I decided on sharing the steak and skipping the sides because those 4 appetizers' portions were surprisingly big and I was already full.  All in all, I had a great time dining here, definitely go check out their coed bathroom too hehe.", "author": "Karen C."}

Especially on a Friday night!\n\nDefinitely the best place to go to if you want really good wagyu beef! Restaurant is kind of loud, but should be expected since there's a lounge right next to where people eat. It is definitely a bit on the pricier side, but what do you expect? It's Wagyu beef! We walked into the restaurant and we were seated earlier than our reservation time. We were seated by the kitchen, where we could see Chef Allen Chen from time to time. Our waiter was Wes and he was definitely honest with what we were ordering. He would tell us if we're ordering too much since some of the dishes were quite filling!\n\nThis is what we ordered:\nOyster Shooters: When I think of shooters, I think of something that I can swallow in one gulp. Not the case here. The watermelon and the other flavor (vinagrette?) definitely complemented the oysters. It was very delicious, and somewhat memorable. \nSalmon Shooters: Highly recommended! Flavors are perfectly balanced!\nSeared Fois Gras: Fois GRAS portion is decent and the pears were delicious! The only thing I didn't eat on that plate was the rolled up thing (Don't know what's it called). It tasted kinda weird. \nTruffle Fries: Addicting and delicious but the texture was weird. It wasn't crunchy and crisp like other fries. Then again, props to them for making truffle fries since I hear it's defintely not easy!\nWorld Wagyu Beef: comes in American, Australian and Chilean. Australian is my favorite because it's very juicy and melts in my mouth. American one was also very delicious. Chilean one was good but in my opinion not as good as the other two. If you really just want a delicious wagyu beef, just order the Australian one. \nOld Aged New York Steak: I am not really a fan of New York steak because most of the ones I had tasted delicious but dry. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste that dry and I can actually taste the flavorfulness of that steak. \n7 Degrees of Chocolate: Very pretty plating and very delicious chocolate (comes in 7 small different flavors like hazelnut, chocolate sprinkles, green tea flavored, etc). I will admit though the lavender flavor tasted kinda weird as a chocolate. \nGrapefruit sorbet: I am a huge fan of sorbet.Ggrapefruit, if you eat it by itself, will have a sharp acidic bite. I was pleasantly surprised that the grapefruit sorbet was delicious. It really did taste like grapefruit but it was definitely more mellow so you can't really taste the sharpness. \n\nOverall, if you really want good beef for dinner and you have a high budget allocation for dinner, you should definitely come here!", "author": "Selina T."}

I had the buffalo filet with seared foie gras. Absolutely heaven!  Tender, flavorful and simply fantastic.  Hubby had the bone in NY... ehhhh. It was a huge piece of meat but left no impression on either of us.  Service was fantastic and the decor was beautiful and comfortable.

In a San Francisco where there's a club that is always full without being crowded, is open until 4am, only plays exactly the music that I like, has plenty of parking nearby, always has a line of cabs outside and is within walking distance of my favorite restaurants, a place like 5a5 would be maybe 2 star at best.* \n\nIn the real San Francisco, where the most important thing about going out is having fun with your friends, 5a5 has always managed to deliver a good going out experience, including saving Sarah Y.'s birthday when Harlot completely fucked things up. \n\nOrder your drinks downstairs and you won't have to wait too long.

Above & beyond I must say. \n\nWe made reservations for 7:45 on a Saturday night. We arrived about 5 minutes late but we were sat right away no problem. We sat in a corner table which I liked because we were excluded. The two tops aren't super close together, so you still have your privacy and are comfortable unlike many restaurants where you're crammed next to total strangers and have to whisper because it's so awkward & close. \n\nThe ambiance is wonderful. Great decor & lighting although they could have turned up the music a tad bit. The restaurant appeared to be clean & organized. \n\nWhen we were sat we were greeted by our server within minutes. He started us off with waters and didn't rush us at all. About 5 minutes later he came by with his \"elevator pitch\" so to say. He went through the menu with suggestions on apps, starters, soups & salads, entrees, and desserts. He showed knowledge without shoving it down our throats.\n\nWe started with the Truffle Fries because we heard crazy good reviews. They weren't OMG like everyone had said, but they were definitely good. They're just basic fries with aoili dipping sauce. I would try something different for a starter next time. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both went with the 10 oz Prime Rib and OMG my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The portion was perfect in size and every bite melted in my mouth. I'm a small girl and usually only finish half of my dinners, but this was too good to box up. This was hands down the best steak both of us have ever had.\n\nI also got a side of shrooms. I liked the variety but they were pretty bland. I just put them on top of my prime rib tho because it came with lots of juicy sauce and it was a great combo.\n\nFor drinks I started off with the Lychee martini. I had never had a martini so delicious. It was so good I guzzled it down within minute. They have an impressive wine list too. We both got a few glasses of the ZD red wine and yummmmm! It paired perfectly with our food.\n\nWe were there for about 2 hours and never rushed to leave or felt forced to order any more or less. \n\nWe were pretty full for dessert but because the server knew my boyfriend had just gotten a promotion he brought out a delicious piece of chocolate cake with the word \"Congratulations\" on the plate COMPLIMENTARY. 10 minutes later he brought out COMPLIMENTARY raspberry truffles as well.\n\nAs we were finishing up he asked if we'd like for him to call our car from valet or call us a taxi. We were shocked he asked. What great service!\n\nOur total came to $145. Pricey but well worth it for 2 steaks, an app, a side, a cocktial, 5 classes of wine and 2 complimentary deserts. \n\nAmazing food.\nAmazing customer service.\nAmazing ambiance.\nJust purely a great experience.\n\nI HIGHLY SUGGEST 5A5!!", "author": "Kristen R."}

Really upbeat, club/lounge type of stuff. What sucked though was how the DJ kept making the music louder and louder! 5A5 is a lounge, not a dance club. People go there to hang out with friends, meet new people etc, not really for dancing... so it would be nice if I could hold a brief conversation with the person next to me without leaning in and screaming in their face.

Just thinking about it is making my drool. I came here with my date on Valentines day and they have a simple menu of a 4 course meal. There was a set price for the meal but if you wanted to upgrade your meat, you could of course and thats what I did :). \nThe one thing I would like to say is that our reservation was at 10 and they didnt seat us until 10;15 when there was obvious tables open and the host had a bit of an attitude. She didnt greet us when we walked in and just stared at us until I had to walk myself up to her and told her that we had reservations at 10 and instead of being happy she just said, \"uhhh...okay??\" and turned around and continue her conversation with one of the bust boy. \n\nAppetizer: I had the Hamachi Tartar. Dear GOD, I have never tasted fish fresher and richer that i had here. I dont know what they did but it was AMAZING. It was the definition of food poor. Im a sushi fanatic and no where have I ever been to that had the fish this fresh before. \nMy date had the Kumamoto Oysters. He was extremely happy with the freshness of the oysters. They were extremely cute ( not that it matters) and the presentation was nice. I mean you cant go wrong with oysters. So not much to complain or say. \nSoup: Lobster Bisque. It was very delightful. Creamy and very thick. The lobster taste was very strong. They also included the claw meat inside that I found extremely sweet and juicy.\nMy date had the French Onion Soup which is my favorite type of soup. I was glad that they didn't throw in a lump of bread which most places do. Don't get me wrong a lot of people love that but for me it's a bit to heavy. Instead they have a freshly toasted crouton with shreds of mozzarella on it. The only thing I would complain about it is that it was a bit salty for my taste. \nEntree: I Had the Japanese Wagyu rare. It was cooked to perfection and the meat just literally melted in my mouth. It was topped with a garlic butter sauteed mushroom, now let me say i LOATHED mushroom with a passion like nothing else. But I don't know what they did but I could eat that as a entree itself. I was so surprised how delicious it tasted. Thank god I didn't throw it aside like I always do. \nMy date had the prime rib rare was cook to perfection also. It sadly didnt have the sauteed mushroom, but was the most juiciest prime rib i had. The cut of the piece and marbling was almost like a rib-eye. \nDessert: I had the triple chocolate cake. My oh my was that sweet. The savoriness of it was a little overwhelming and after eating that whole meal I couldnt get myself to eat more than two bites. \nMy date had the strawberry souffle. When it was brought out the server made a hole through the middle and drizzled some orange syrup into it. I never had a souffle before so my interpretation of it was a strawberry omelette so i wasn't a fan of it but to each their own. He told it was was very delicious. \noverall I was extremely happy with my meal  and i will defiantly come back again!!! ( hopefully they have a new host by then)", "author": "Linda L."}

The interior design and use of lighting made the restaurant feel comfortable. I was freezing because I may have sitting under a vent so I won't hold it against 5A5. \n\nWe were promptly seated despite there being caught in traffic near the Caldecot Tunnel which made us about half an hour late (some idiots decided to play bumper cars right were the lanes merge from 5 to 2 in order to enter the tunnel - only one bore was open going west). \n\nOur drinks were quickly taken and we decided to look at the regular menu and the Dine-About-Town menu which offered a 3 course meal for a discounted price. \n\nI tried out the Derby Cocktail (Maple Syrup, Bourbon and something else), it was pretty good except that it came in a very festive glass. Then I decided to be a rebel and order from the main menu (my wallet cried) and the other friends I was with ordered from the DAT menu. \n\nMy menu selection comprised of a Cesar salad, the new york strip (8oz cut) and a banana creme tart. Someone ordered the fillet. For sides our table split two which was more than enough, the potatoes and mushrooms. \n\nMy meal the salad was excellent, very fresh the dressing was mixed in perfectly. I especially am fond of the anchovies decorating the plate, I love my fish. Someone else enjoyed picking at the non-fishy parts in the salad and seemed to like the taste also. \n\nMy New York Strip came out perfectly cut and seasoned, I ordered it cooked Medium and that's exactly what I got. The sauce on the plate was mouth watering. \n\nOne of the only downsides of the meal was the Fillet we got as it appeared to be a bit overcooked and actually I couldn't finish it. I decided not let such a choice cut go to waste so I gobbled it up, it was definitely a bit over cooked still soft but had a texture more like cow tongue steak (which I used to eat all the time growing up in a Russian household). \n\nThe sides to the main course were excellent and were definitely something new, the potatoes were the size of grapes and the mushrooms were skinny, not quite what I had expected but pleasant nonetheless. \n\nThe desert was absolutely excellent, it was a very good tart the caramelized bananas on the side added to the beauty and wonderful sweetness of the dish. \n\nOverall a very excellent restaurant, but beware it is very expensive so get ready to shell out if you come here. They offer a 5A5 special steaks and dishes sold by the ounce (like $20/ounce) which is way out of most people's budgets. I'd definitely think of taking a business client here as some point for dinner if cost was of no object.", "author": "Mark K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-28", "description": "The steak serverd to us at 5a5 was prepared in a manner that we found to be mediocre. The meat was very high quality and potentially delicious but the preparation was lacking in some fundamental way that made it a meh overall. \nOur theory is that they cook the steaks very slowly resulting in an extremely even level of doneness throughout the thick, expensive steaks. This strategy fails to sufficiently caramelize the surface of the meat or to render any fat, and the steaks arrived relatively cool and juiceless at the table. I kept imagining the potential deliciousness that was obviously present in the meat but at the same time absent because of the 5A5 kitchen's obsessive perfectionism. Its as if the chef was too intent on preparing the perfect medium-rare steak and sold the meat's soul along the way. \n\nOtherwise the food was good, the truffle fries were tasty, and the service was excellent.

The ambiance of the restaurant was dim (a little too dim) and had a very modern feel to it. The service was amazing! Servers were very detailed with the menu and attentive to serving us. Either the chef in the back was informed it was my birthday or they are just very generous because they kept serving us complimentary dishes! \n\nFor shooters, we tried the hamachi and maguro. Both of them were quite tasty but I preferred the hamachi over the other. You take these down as if it were a shot of alcohol, which was interesting to do. On their Bites menu, we had the truffle fries which were undoubtedly delicious! Nothing can go wrong with crisp shoestring fries sprinkled with truffle oil! As starters, we tried the Kobe beef sashimi which had amazing flavor and the ponzu sauce pairing with the sashimi was lip-smackingly good! We also tried the Tako salad which I didn't care too much for. It didn't taste as great as it sounded on the menu. I was expecting more of an acidic flavor to it, but it leaned more towards the bland side. As our main courses, I had the misoyaki seabass dish and my BF had the bone-in rib-eye dish. Trust me, this may be known as a steak lounge, but as a huge seafood fan, this seabass did not disappoint. It was cooked and seared to perfection that with each bite of the fish, it melted in your mouth like butter. The broth that it was accompanied with didn't do much to compliment the seabass, but on its own, the seabass was already delicious! The rib-eye from the looks of it just looked mouth-watering good. I had a bite of it and it was cooked just right and packed in great flavor with its aged-balsamic sauce. We did have dessert to end the dinner (on top of their own complimentary dessert), which I can't really remember what it was as I was too full to eat much of it. I believe it had some crispy wafer like texture to the chocolate cake. Also, if you like white wine, I would recommend trying the Dr. Loosen Riesling! It is a sweet white wine and was super yummy that paired well with our meal. Great meal, great experience!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-09-29", "description": "Let me start by saying that I like to consider myself a fair guy and I've had my fair share of so so service, so I welcome any input on whether or not I'm being too harsh with my following review.\n\nI recently came here with a group of friends for a good buddy's birthday party and the experience we had was unexpected of a place of this \"caliber\". \n\nI'll start with the good.  The food was pretty decent.  I did enjoy the oyster and poke shooters.  I'd rather have a poke salad over a shooter, but I'll give them kudos for being creative.  The filet mignon was cooked to my liking and was satisfying.  The main course did come with mac & cheese and asparagus, which was amusing (in a good way).  \n\nYou've probably noticed that my food review is pretty short.  That's because the food simply did not give me a good enough lasting impression over the service we had to deal with. \n\nNow to the nitty gritty.  My buddy's girlfriend spent 2 days visiting 5A5 beforehand to taste the wine and menu and to confirm the back room for our group.  She wanted his birthday to be a special occasion, so it was a complete surprise when, on the day of the event, the hostess told us that the back room was unavailable to us.  Evidently, they forgot to keep our reservation.  They tried to make up some lame excuse about not having a contract signed, but they should have brought that up when my friend took the time the previous 2 days to sample the wine/menu and reserve the room.  Someone at the restaurant obviously dropped the ball on the reservation front.  Nothing irks me more than people who don't own up to their own mistakes.\n\nTo make up for the mistake, after trying to place blame on us, they comped us some drinks.  That was ok, for the moment, and it looked like everything was going to work out.\n\nWe were told the room would be available after the current party was finished.  The party using the room had already finished their meal and were jibber-jabbering far past any decent excusable timeframe on a busy night.  We asked the manager to do his job and ask the party to please finish, but since he lacked a pair, all he did was sheepishly ask the party to finish to which the response from the party was to piss off.  Now at this point, if I was the manager, I would have mentioned that there was a party waiting on their reservation and that they could move their conversation to the lounge area, which had plenty of room, but did he do that?...uh, no.  Instead he let them have their way with his establishment and had us wait for over an hour.  One word comes to mind when describing the manager...(fill in the blank here, rhymes with wussy)...\n\nWe were eventually seated at two separate tables, causing our group to be split.  You can imagine the awkwardness of this.  To add insult to injury only the prix fix menu was available after all that waiting.\n\nEventually, another friend of ours personally went to the back room and politely asked the party to either finish their conversation or please move to the lounge area.  They were at first belligerent, but someone came to their senses and realized they were being incredibly rude by taking up the space for an overextended period of time, so they left.  Now, this is the first time at any eating establishment that I've seen such a weak display from the management in client control.  I have never had to witness a friend of mine having to ensure our own reservation in this way.  It was completely and utterly unacceptable.  We would have left the establishment but stayed out of respect for the birthday boy and his girlfriend.\n\nAfter finally being seated in the room.  We were hastily served our food.  One of the waiters actually gave one of our party a sneer (which he didn't think anyone noticed), as if we were bothering him by making him serve us...in other words, do his job.  Unbelievable!  Now, in my mind, if you've had a group experience the service we had encountered, could you blame us for being visibly irritated?  And wouldn't you do your best to accomodate for your establishments failings?  This concept seems to be lost to the management at 5A5.\n\nAs respectful patrons, we actually left a decent tip.  \n\nI usually give places a 2nd chance, but not in this case.  For me, no matter how great your food is or could be, if the service is not on par then the only taste left is a bitter aftertaste. \n\n5A5, you taste like feet.", "author": "Ehb T."}

The gazpacho was served with a few slices of avocado, which earns them brownie points in my book, and it was the perfect summer soup - light, tangy, and refreshing.  The \"Philet\" sandwich was a pretty good size, served with your choice of fries, onion rings, or mixed greens, or you could upgrade to truffle fries.  The truffle fries had a very distinct flavor, and one that I can't say I'm particularly fond of.  The sandwich, however, was very tasty and filling.  The filet was well-seasoned and tender, and there was enough cheese on top to make my day.  They definitely didn't skimp on either the portion size or the service despite my friend and I ordering off the DAT menu, the way other reastaurants have been known to do.

I love the croc print on the chairs and menus, and the python print on the walls.  I'm just into that right now .  The place was pretty empty when my hubby and I arrived, yet, instead of being seated in the larger open space in the middle of the restaurant (what you see in some of the pictures), we were kind of tucked into the upper level in the back - right by the stairs to the bathrooms.  ???  Even by the end of our meal, the main dining area was not full - so I don't know why we were seated away from everything.\n\nWe shared the iceberg lettuce salad to start.  YUMMY!  A little too much dressing, but the dressing itself was amazing.  So bleu cheesy, creamy and good.  The large chunks of smoked bacon and Fuji apples really provided a good mix of salty and sweet.\n\nFor dinner, hubby ordered the bone in rib-eye, and I ordered a bone in filet mignon.  Sides included mac and cheese, asparagus with Parmesan, and corn with edemame.\n\nThe sides were fabulous.  The mac and cheese had a really nice bite with the stronger Gruyere cheese in it (a must try).  The corn with edamame was delicious - but really needs to be served in a bowl - or at least a plate with a ridge/rim (or whatever you call it).  Could not spoon any corn without it getting on the table.  The plate had no sides.  It was completely flat.  Not practical for corn.  The asparagus was good - really nice with the Parmesan on it.\n\nNotice that I've gone on and on about the sides... not the steaks.  Why?  Because it was disappointing - and this is a Steak Lounge!  Both hubby and I ordered our steaks medium.  His came out red.  It wasn't rare inside - it was more raw.  His was sent back to cook more - took another 10 minutes (that's how raw it was).  My steak was thin (a filet is small around, but it's usually thick), and it was also rare/raw!  Mine leaned slightly more towards the rare side, so I was able to eat it (I don't mind) but still - it's not what I ordered.  Hubby was full from eating the sides by the time his steak came back to the table.\n\nThat aside, our waiter did all he could to make it up to us.  Offered us free wine (which we didn't take), wanted to cover our valet parking (but we didn't need it), and also gave us free dessert (delicious green tea donuts - OMG -sounds weird, but trust me - order them).  \n\nOn the whole, we were very disappointed with the steaks - considering where we were, and the fact that there were only three other tables in the place.  Three!  What were the chefs doing?  It's one thing to under cook one steak, but both from the same order?\n\nSo, really 3.5 stars - pushed up because of really good service from our waiter, the amazing side dishes, and the restaurant decor itself.", "author": "Denise M."}

As I waited for my date to come (though supposedly I should pick her up, things always have their complexities), the hostess redirected me to the lounge/bar area while I snacked upon the edamame with a brew of green tea. Edamame may seem overpriced (6 dollars) for an appetizer, it's actually not too bad since they apply an ample amount of oil and garlic as well as a considerable amount of edamame to munch on. \n\nMy reservation was scheduled at 6:15 pm but my date got there at 6:30 pm, we ended up going to our table around 6:47 with a choice of which tables we wanted (though we did come on a Sunday).\n\nAs soon as we were seated (Seats are not as comfortable as they look by the way), we ordered the bone in rib eye and the Australian f1 wagyu steaks with sides of mushrooms and Mac and cheese. Both  very delicious and tender steaks. Truffle fries are a must for potato lovers. Though their soups are delicious,( we had clam chowder) they are optional when coming to a steak lounge ( you go to a steak house since they specialize in steaks, not seafood or soup...)\n\nOverall, though their steaks and they're appetizers are phenomenal, I have to give them just 4 stars, since the waiting staff does not know when they are interrupting conversation, but I would definitely come back for a celebratory festivity, just not for dates.", "author": "Alvin L."}

Even the bar/lounge area is spacious and segregated enough from the eating area. i came here for an evening with the girls and we started off with beef tataki with delicious daikon and fries. For my entree, I chose the filet mignon, and the nice thing about this place was they have 2 portion sizes, so you do not have to order anything too large. The filets come in 6 or 10 oz, and the Australian wagyu ( 2 of my friends ordered that) came in the smallest portion at 4 oz. The seabass was also delicious, light and flaky. My filet was cooked medium rare, and prepared very well although a tad bit salty but still very good. It had these bits of ham on the side. \n\nWe then tried the A5 sampler which included the rib cap, new york, filet and rib eye. WOW, all I can say was extremely delicious, melt in your mouth like butter meat. We could not waste a single bite of it.\nFor sides, we chose mac and cheese, asparagus and mushrooms. \nAnd for dessert, we tried green tea donuts (we were told this was usually the crowd favorite). Its different and has a raspberry dipping sauce. My favorite was the banana pie, it had a delicious crust. Maybe I'm biased because I just love banana pie.

I am used to the old school wood panels, red velvet and lots of old white people. This is refreshing Japanese fusion steak lounge. \n\nThe lounge is nice and the fire features are sexy. The dining area decor is very nice, cozy booths and tables. The kitchen is visible but not audible. The ceiling lighting however, I am not a fan of the punch out light is it LED? Is it cells? I couldn't stop looking up to try and figure it out. \n\nFirst of all BACON BREAD. Seriously? So tasty and a good teaser as to what to expect. \n\nHamachi shooters add an interesting touch to a steak house experience. I am not a sushi gal, but I tried the ginger and some of the juice and the flavor was quite nice. \n\nIceberg wedge salad was very good. Not too much dressing as others have commented. Sugar cube sized bacon chunks, not crispy but really flavor full. \n\nThe 5A5 steak prices were too high for me on this visit. Someone else was paying so I felt I needed to be more reasonable with my order. I ordered the Australian Kobe 4 oz. Since the sides come separately it did look small and lonely on my plate, but the sides came soon after. The flavor was incredibly rich and it was cooked perfectly medium as I asked for. \n\nThe sides we ordered were the corn, the mushrooms and the mac and cheese. The corn had Kafir lime leaves in it and I loved that subtle flavor. The mushrooms were really well cooked and had the perfect texture. The mac was of course decadent and rich. It overwhelmed the other more delicate dishes in richness. \n\nDesert, yes the green tea doughnuts. They tasted like regular sugar dusted doughnuts to me with a slight green tea flavor. Yes very good, but the caramel crisp was decadently good. They serve mighty leaf tea which is one of my favorite teas available. \n\nOur Waiter was great. He is a sommelier as well so he was great with the wine selection. He and the other servers and bus boys were perfectly attentive. We were all gabbing away and he was very polite when approaching mid conversation. \n\nThe downstairs are is a bit weird. Dark unisex bathrooms. A communal hand washing sink.

What helped me find it was their valet stand on the street.  The area can get very very cold since it's right near the pier so be sure to bring a coat, even if it's warm when you're first arriving.\n\nWhen I first walked into the restaurant the first thing that caught my eye was the life fire to the right, very classy 5A5, i love it.  Then as we walked in we were greeted by the hostess who brought us over to our table.  The entire restaurant is booth-style and is set up like a lounge.  Pretty stylish, sleek, and actually makes me feel like I'm in some sort of Vegas nightclub.\n\nSo many choices on their menu looked delicious but we decided to go with the: truffle fries, NY bone-in steak, buffalo fillet, macaroni and cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, and green tea doughnuts for dessert.  It all sounded so great then, but little did we realize that we seriously ordered way to much food.\n\nRegardless of that, the food was absolutely delicious.  The NY bone-in steak was huge, but very very tasty -- and the only steak I can eat without having to dip it in anything.  It tasted amazing by itself.  The sides were fantastic, esp the macaroni and cheese ... the best I have ever EVER had in my life.  Lastly the green tea doughnuts were perfect.  It was an amazing way to end the dinner.  Also we had Chimay Red beers with our food which was great as well.\n\nOur server, Danel, was amazing the entire time and always had us smiling.  He made some great suggestions and we never felt like we were looking for him.\n\nAfter we ate what we could of our food we found ourselves with half of each side and 75% of the NY steak left.  So as my best friend went to the restroom I was approached by one of their many bussers and was asked if he could remove the plates from my table.  I replied with, \"Sure.  Thank you.  Could I get a box to bring it home or do you pack it up?\"  And the employee says, \"Sure.  I can do it.\"  So he continues to take away my plates and the server returns to grab my plate which had the steak on it.  I then informed my friend that they were packing up our left overs and I went to their downstairs area to use the restrooms.  The restroom area is really nice and very sheik.  It has a perfect dark mood lighting, a center area for washing hands, and little 'mini rooms' for the toilets.  The little toilet room I went into was decorated very modern and very cute.  There was also a sink inside of it already.\n\nAfter using the restroom I made my way back to the table and our server comes by to drop off our left overs, from there we noticed that there was only one box and saw that it was only the steak.  We asked our server about the other left overs, and although no one said a thing ... it seemed as though the busser/side server that picked it up accidentally threw it all away.  But it looked like they recooked our sides, but never told us what really happened ... in the end that doesn't matter cuz we got our sides to bring home with the steak.\n\nThe dessert was AMAZING and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I definitely recommend the green tea doughnuts to anyone that visits this place!\n\nMy Advice??:  Try to get Daniel as a server, can't speak for the other servers, but I know that he was absolutely fantastic.  If you're a party of 2 ask for a corner booth table so you get a kind of a more private area.  Next, if you order too much food like me and are trying to take it home ... don't let the any of the side-servers/bussers take it; only let your server box it up for you.  And lastly, try the doughnuts!  =)\n\nI would LOVE to come back here again, and try their other menu choices.  I am also planning on coming back here to check it out as a Lounge.  I was told that it becomes a lounge after hours ... so we'll see.  =)\n\nAlso, the total of our bill was $185 including tax and tip.  ;)", "author": "Pia V."}

The food wasn't four stars, it's three.\n\nENVIRONMENT: 5A5 has a nice happy hour atmosphere.  There's a little fire behind glass when you walk through the door, and a large bar area that's cozy and welcoming.  The lighting aims for fashionable and young.  The patrons are around their twenties to mid-thirties, more casual (imagine nice designer jeans with dress top, but you can get away with slacks).  The happy hour are cute (small portions), tasted DECENT at best, and a bit pricey.  \n\nFOOD: 5A5's menu tries to be heavily Japanese influenced (ie.hamachi shooter, wagyu beef, etc) It's sort of wannabe classy, but failed.  The restaurant is very americanized with dishes like truffle fries (average for $8), and kobe beef sliders.  \n\nIf one prefers their beef to be spectacular, then 5A5 is not your place. For example, the dry aged filet is okay, but Harris' dry aged is way better, and it's around the same price.  The filet was good, but doesn't compare to Bobo's. I don't know how good the Wagyu is, so I can't comment.  It has a hefty price tag, and if I'm going to pay more than $100 for wagyu, I'm going to take my wallet somwehere nicer. \n\nBUT...get the green tea donut!!! mmm...that was special\n\nWINE: Meh....nothing special.\n\nSo overall, if you're aiming to wind down, don't care too much for the beef, and want some place more relaxing, then I recommend 5A5.  But if you're aiming for blow your mind beef, then head to Bobo's, Morton's, Harris', Bob's Steak and Chophouse, or the many many steak houses that San Francisco has to offer.", "author": "Carrie-C N."}

It's a beautiful restaurant with a classy vibe and a cool little patio in the back for that cigar aficionado. Heat lamps are a plus.  The bathrooms downstairs are something else.  I'm not usually alarmed by small, dark places, but once I closed the door to the bathroom, it was very hard to see, but I get it.  Atmosphere.  \n\nWe chose the 2nd seating which featured 6 courses and included admission to the NYE party.  \n\nWe arrived just a bit before 8pm and were greeted and seated pretty quickly.\n\nOur drink orders where taken and I found a nice buzz inducing cocktail made from Effen black cherry vodka, Cointreau & lime.  I made the right chose as I'm a vodka gal.\n\nWe were starving and waited a bit for the first course which were a Duo of Shooters: hamachi, avocado, ginger and ponzu which was good.  I cannot remember what the other shooter was as they lost me at the mention of quail eggs.  Thanks, I'm cool.\n\nSecond course was Seared Scallops and Foie Gras.  When the dish was put in front of my girlfriend, she asked if the Foie Gras was a burnt mushroom.  No one commented and we only told after she had ate it that it was duck liver.  I loved the look on her face!  \n\nAhh, the third course, I believe we waited over 40 minutes for...Caesar salad.  Your basic salad with bits of applewood smoked bacon on the side and a surprise of Dungeness crab underneath the romaine.\n\nOne of my friends did request if they could possibly bring the courses out a bit quicker as we wanted to go somewhere else for the countdown as it was approaching 10:30.\n\nSea Bass & Escargot were next.  I did like the pineapple & vanilla chutney that came on the Sea Bass.  Next!\n\nFinally, the Kobe Filet Mignon & Griddle Prawn.  Needless to say the table got quiet and we devoured the Filet Mignon.  I probably enjoyed this course the most.\n\nDessert came up pretty quickly as well it should as it now was after 11p.m.  It was some chocolate concoction with vanilla ice cream and another nondescript dessert with pomegranate.\n\nThe bill came at 11:40 pm and there was a mess up with the gratuity.

Added insult to steak-injury!\n\nNone of our group of 5 diners was blown away by this place, which is really expensive for a lunch (8 oz NY strip steak was $29).  For that price I expect some high quality.  Everything else we ordered (mashed potatoes with cheddar, mac and cheese, sauteed spinach) was  forgettable.

We had their truffle fries as an appetizer, which have completely ruined me for any fries, past, present, and future.  Hubby ordered 10 oz. prime rib, and I had the 6 oz. filet with foie gras option.  We also split the potato gratin side.  \n\nHe loved his prime rib, but my filet was was AMAZING.  Perfectly cooked, and incredibly tender.  We had the foie gras torchon at La Folie a month ago, and it was an introduction to foie for the both of us.  The experience was \"meh\", but the seared foie here was on point.  He was pleasantly surprised about it, since he was less impressed than I was with our earlier experience.  The potato gratin was alright, I heard our server recommend the macaroni and cheese at another table, but it was nothing special.  Almost took away a star for the side, but the meat more than made up for it.  We also had the triple chocolate dessert, which was really good too.  \n\nOh, he also had a fantastic Japanese red beer here.

A \"fancy\" steakhouse that overcooks your wagyu crossbred steak?   I guess they did offer to re-fire another steak but everything leading up to this point really didn't seem to make this worth while.  Also, my waiter \"accidentally\" ordered the 8oz steak that effectively would double the cost of my meal?  They fixed this problem and only charged me for the 4oz ordered.  I think they wanted me to be more excited about getting a \"free\" 4 oz of expensive overcooked meat.  I wasn't.  Not sure if it was because the meat was overcooked or because the waygu crossbred wasn't as tender as described to us.  Either way, I didn't enjoy my expensive piece of steak.  It was a fail.  \n2. My husband got a barely edible NY steak that was full of gristle.  Double fail.\n3. Poor customer service.  First,  the hostess forgets us at the bar and we had to remind the bartender that we had reservations 15 minutes after our reservation time.  Then instead of coming to get us, he sends the bartender back to tell us we can go to them whenever we are ready.  Um...we are ready and that is why you went to ask about our reservation.  Ok. Hostess/manager person, this is how it should have went down.  We come in 45 minutes early for our reservation.  We check in with the hostess to say we will grab a drink before our table is ready.  At 9:30, the hostess will come over to us and checkin to let us know our table is ready and we can be seated whenever we are ready.  That is a free customer service 101 lesson.  You are welcome!  \n4. Maybe it was because we had a later seating but please don't rush our dining experience!  I have come out to have a nice meal and don't want to feel like you want me to come and go ASAP.  This is not some cheap diner which counts on turnover.  So when we finally do order, we ask for himachi bites, salad, steak with various sides. They bring out the amuse bouche, bread, himachi bite and salad all at one.   How did they know I wanted to eat everything all at once and didn't want to savor the salty himachi bite without the boring flavorless salad?!?!  It would have been perfect if they brought out out the steak with all the starters but alas I feel like our small 2 seater couldn't handle it.  Otherwise, I am sure they would have.  But alas the real disappointment was the steak...the real reason we all go out to a \"nice\" steakhouse\n\nMaybe I expect too much when I go out and end up $300 for a meal?  But the extremely poor execution of the meat isn't the only reason I would never recommend this place to anyone!   I think we had the B-team on staff which added to the poor experience.  I will write this evening off as an expense comedy of errors.  But please, if you like a good steak, don't come here!  Do yourself a favor and go to Alexander's or Harris'!", "author": "Tammy S."}

When we were done with that, we ventured over to the bar and hung out while the DJs spun. \n\nThe best thing about this place is definitely the decor and ambiance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-14", "description": "I used to basically live at this place when it was Frisson.  I host many happy hours, and 2/3 of the time, I would opt for Frisson's lounge area.  \n\nSo it was a sad day for me when I found out they had died.\n\nSome time later, I noticed all of the birthday parties and events I was being invited to were being held at some place called \"A5\"... or sometimes \"5A5\" - and without a sign on the  front door, I still have no idea which is the real name but I have been here 3 times now.  New party venue?  \n\nThe first two times, it was for parties, and I was impressed in that the lounge area was just as inviting as it used to be when it was Frisson. The problem w/ Frisson, though, was the food.  I ate there often but the food was mediocre - but when you call yourself a \"steakhouse\" - I'm enough of a fool to try it once before ripping on it.\n\nLet's be clear - I am extremely picky about my steak.  I am the diva of meats.  I will take down any kind of meat and give it a shot.  I will take a chunk out of a newly slaughtered animal if someone says it tastes  good.  Be it grass or corn-fed, be it in Australia or Argentina - I have eaten there, and I know my meat - and more importantly, I love and respect meat.\n\nMeat is my friend.\n\nWell, folks - A5 does NOT disappoint.\n\nThe decor here is, thankfully, not as orange as Frisson was, but light neutral colors and absolutely romantic and intimate with a lot of booth seating.  It has a patio out back, and a back section reserved for large groups.  You have a partial view into the large kitchen.  The lighting, the layout and the general aura of A5 is stunning.\n\nBefore getting into the food, let's just touch on service.  The owners/managers were very courteous.  The few servers we encountered over the course of the evening were outstanding.  Some tried a bit too hard - and it seemed like a fake smile was glued to their face - but I'm not one to dock for trying.  Keep trying... and hopefully one day it will be more natural.  I never lacked for wine or water in my glass, and people came by just enough to make sure the dining experience exceeded our expectations.\n\nMy friend JH and I were at dinner - and Archie R. joined us later.  We all had hamachi shooters at $4 a pop, and it's a nice start to a meal.  You can definitely taste the hamachi, soy sauce, and caviar put into this little concoction - it's delightful.  They offered us complimentary glasses of champagne on the house, and that was quite nice.  JH and I also ordered two glasses of Riesling to drink with the shooters and the shrimp cocktail appetizer that we shared.  The shrimp, I would skip next time.  While good, it wasn't special.\n\nMy friend had the filet mignon - I was ecstatic to find the buffalo steak on the menu and opted for that - though we shared a bite of each other's for Yelp's sake.  The filet mignon was seasoned beautifully - not an ounce of salt or pepper needed on that type of perfection.  My buffalo steak, however, stole the show.  At $47 for a 10 oz. cut - I never saw a more gorgeous sight in my whole life as I cut into this chunk of meat - - perfectly cooked to a nice, medium-rare, and juicy to the last bite.  My friend Archie showed up mid-dinner and though the steak was cold, even he confirmed that this was one fine steak.\n\nBuffalo Steak... \nJust when I thought it couldn't get better, I took a bite of the potato-croquette type of concoction that accompanied my steak - and was immediately taken to another realm.  I do not know exactly what was in this - but between the cheesiness and crispness on the outside, gooey goodness on the inside - with a mouthful of buffalo - - the only thing that made it better was the sip of wine I took to wash it down.\n\nSpeaking of wine - I brought a bottle of my own Turnbull wine that I had been saving in my cellar to dinner.  Corkage fee at the restaurant was $20, which is in my opinion, the fair cost for a meal of this caliber.  I can't stand it when restaurants gouge you on corkage - some of us have nice wines at home that we are willing to pay extra to drink there, but charging more than $20 to provide us w/ glasses during a meal we are opting to have at your establishment is not just ridiculous -  but rude.   A5's corkage is fair, and they provided good service to go along with it.  I should also note that their wine list is superb - in my opinion, since they seem to have many of the wines that I enjoy the most!\n\nAfter dinner, there was an event going on at the lounge, and we opted to stay on in the dining section, enjoying the house music while having more wine, dessert and coffee.  The dinner portion, bearing in mind I brought my own wine, was $146, not including tip.  The after-portion, not including tip was $56 for coffee, a bottle of wine, and one outstanding cheesecake that was tart, slightly sweet, creamy but not heavy at all.  \n\nI will be back to A5 time and again, not only for their events but dinner.  \n\nIt borders on perfection.", "author": "Grace K."}

You take an elevator or stairs down to a lobby below the restaurant where there is an open bathroom with a large sink in the middle, stalls around the room cloaked in a dim mood lighting. Kind of weird at first but you get used to it.

You would be daft to not realize that these guys are trained to do the Alexander's menu very well, and they're more or less doing it at a new location now.     5A5 doesn't seem to have anything to truly set it apart and make it more unique than Alexander's, but they're producing very good food here, so really, I am not complaining.\n\nGood things.   Unexpected bacon abounds.  In the bread and the salad, you guessed it, delicious, savory bacon.    The starters were very good - although their hamachi shots are not as refined as the one's at Alexander's - although it's close - it's not quite there yet.   Mac and cheese was surprisingly light, although didn't stand out as particularly amazing. Good, though.\n\nSteaks.  Went for the Australian F1 which was $65 for 10oz.  Kind of a mid-range between a standard filet and a Kobe steak.   Had a lot of similar traits to Kobe, but wasn't excessively rich and overwhelming like Kobe can be some times.  Beyond the steak, the plate was pretty much barren and looked kind of sad.  It was a tasty steak, but their aesthetics could use a kick in the pants.   All in all, an excellent piece of meat, cooked very nicely, which is what most people come here for.  Well done.\n\nDessert.   Opted to share a batch of the waiter's favorite matcha (green tea) donuts.  Fresh, hot donuts are always delicious, so it's kind of hard to go wrong, and since I love green tea, it's a slam dunk.   Sadly, there was very little green tea flavor in them, they just tasted like great, fresh donuts.   The oolong tea ice cream which it was paired with was excellent. \n\nFor a shot of the green tea donuts, check out my Flickr stream (http://www.flickr.com/photos/swnktstic/3840814889/)\n\n5A5 is a neat little spot, overall.  I hope they survive, thrive, and find something to truly set them apart and make them unique.   Alexander's is still a better route to take in my opinion, but given how far away they are from each other, it's not a decision which most will have to make.", "author": "chris c."}

Well prepared quinoa and a dazzling blend of spices. I haven't had sous vide chicken before but I'm a total convert now; the meat was so tender and delicious.\n-Skip the red velvet souffle; it's sort of good, but you're better off getting a more distinctive dessert (a.k.a. bread pudding) and just getting your red velvet fix at a boutique cupcakerie.\n\nThe bathrooms are confusing but really quirky.

All of his recommendations were very good. I would not really worry about the prices of these items since you already decided to come here to eat. The A5 wagyu shooter ($9) is really good. If you're not into spending $28 per ounce, then this is a good substitute. We also had the hamachi ($4) shooter and the day boat scallops ($12, I think). I have not had scallops prepared this well possibly ever. We also had the corn soup ($13) which was just added (for the lobster bisque). This corn soup, again, nothing like we've ever had so I would also recommend it. \n\nFor my main course, I had the australia F1 \"kobe\" 8oz ($65). It was really tender and really good. The flavour is not your typical taste due to its hybrid nature. Again, if you don't want to spend $28 per ounce, this might be a good substitute as well. I also got to try the dry aged bone in filet ($29) and the bone in flavour makes this also really good. \n\nFor sides, we had the baby bok choy with bacon and nuts ($8) and the mashed potatoes with the candied bacon ($9). The smoky bacon was amazing. Could have had a whole plate of it and the mashed potatoes were so creamy. \n\nToo full for dessert as you might imagine. \n\nParking is valet $8, but if you live in the east bay, it's an easy BART ride to embarcadero.", "author": "Andrew Y."}

From the pictures of this place online, it looked modern and chic. I unfortunately, did not look at the reviews so we were coming to this restaurant pretty open-minded.\nWe arrived on time and were seated on one of the booths near the entrance to the kitchen. I didn't mind and my b.f. didn't either. The lighting on the wall was very nice. The place was packed that night (Saturday maybe)..it had a lot of people just having a good time, eating, drinking, talking, and laughing. The place looked beautiful at night actually. The gorgeous huge circular lighting in the middle of the ceiling and the low lighting of the lamps on everyone's table made the whole place come together beautifully! \nAfter looking over the appetizers, we settled on a Shishito peppers. It came promptly, but we were also surprised to have gotten someone else's appetizer by mistake. It was the  Kobe beef Sashimi. We tried it anyway...hey its not our fault the waiter gave us someone else's food. The app we ordered wasn't as good as the mistake app that was given to us because after the waiter realized his mistake he apologized to us and quickly took away our almost finished dish. I didn't like the Kabayaki sauce or the Bonito flakes that were on the peppers. The Shiitake, leek, pickled ginger, and truffled ponzu was just a tasty combination!  We were disappointed that we didn't get to finish the delicious Swahili app but we were happy that we got to try them for free...the app we ordered wasn't even eaten after that. After 25 minutes or so we finally got our main dish. My b.f. ordered the Buffalo fillet mignon (a special substitute that night due to the fact that they ran out of the slow roasted prime rib) and I got a chicken dish with spinach. My chicken was good but wasn't memorable..it was actually forgettable. But my b.f.'s meal was very tasty. He filled up on some red wine and so couldn't finish his meal but he said his steak was fall off the bone delicious! If we were to come back we would get the Kobe beef sashimi starter this time and try some main dish that is recommended by the waiter. Hopefully they'll make a special.

The difference is that Alexanders doesnt disappoint in the main and 5A5 disappoints - big time. \n\nIn a Group of 5:\n\nStarters:\nHamachi Shots \nA5 Wagyu \nTruffle Fries\nIce Berg Salad\n\nMain:\nFilet Mignon\nBuffola Filet\nAustralian f1 Kobe NY\n\nSides:\nMac and Cheese\nMushrooms\nFingerling Potatoes\n\nI thought everything except for the main was delicious. I was disappointed that the starters and sides tasted exactly the same at Alexanders. I was expecting something different with some flair. \n\nThe main was very disappointing. For some reason, the chefs cooked the beef upon order, left it waiting to cool down. By the time the beefs arrived to our table, it was cold. The buffalo tasted charred with a charcoal ending. The f1 wasnt cooked the way I ordered and etc. \n\nService needs a lot of improvement such as following instructions and serving drinks/apps without reminding them.  But this review isnt about service, just food. \n\nI'm afraid that this place will only be well known as the party spot than a great steakhouse establishment. Little space or not, you dont see too many or ANY top rated/michelin establishments known for their after hours right? \"Hey, lets go to Gary Dankos. I heard they serve a great bomb martini and the bartender is hot!\" Catch my drift? \n\nIf you havent been to Alexanders, try this place first then Alexanders. You'll notice that there's a wide gap between the two establishments in A LOT OF THINGS. And 5A5 has a long way to go especially which identity they want to be known as: the great steakhouse or the cool bar/lounge hang out spot that makes bomb martinis and a hot bartender?", "author": "Ken C."}

The hamachi shooters were decent, but the fish wasn't the freshest.  The best part of our meal was the mac n cheese though.

We got there around 10:30 and it was interesting because people were still eating dinner so it hadn't yet turned into that late night scene. It transitioned a little after 11 or somewhere around there and the lights got darker, the DJ started playing top 40 type of music instead of just techno, and our bottle service started. \n\nThis place requires that guys wear a collar, or at least that is what it says online, but there were tons of guys who came in with jackets over tshirts and were let in and walked around all night in too tight tshirts! If you are going to have a dress code for some, it should be for all! \n\nThe other thing I really didn't like about this place as a \"going out spot\" is that it is very cliquey. It isn't the type of atmosphere that promotes mingling. It is mostly different groups of cliques come in and hang out in a circle or at their table and only speak to each other. I like to go out and meet new people, talk, dance, etc. This is the kind of place that you need to bring a big group of people - and you better enjoy them!  \n\nAs far as I know, there is no cover ever, but I am not positive.\nStreet parking is minimal, but they do have valet for 10 dollars.  Catching a cab after is also quite hard so I would suggest having someone call and have a cab sent  around 1 or 1:15 because they kick you out of the lounge right around 1:30 (I thought bars closed at 2) and it clears out quickly.\n\nOverall, I would probably go back here again if it was for a birthday or something because it is free to get in, but it really isn't my ideal crowd.

It wasn't at all crowded on that Wednesday night.\n\nWhen Larry and I were here for dinner a two weeks ago our dinner got off to a bumpy start when I made a reservation OpenTable but then had to push back our seating time by an hour because Larry was stuck with a client at work (sales is a bitch). I called a few times to reach the hostess but only got the voicemail, so I left a message. Once I got to a computer, I went to OpenTable to modify my reservation online in which I was successful and I got a confirmation email right away. We didn't worry about it at all after but when we arrived they said their phone was unplugged because the ringer is too loud. Uh, what? I mean, we made it in time, so why did they care to tell us that detail? Funny and a bit unprofessional. Moving on...\n\nThe menu is well-rounded with several cuts of meat in varying sizes prepared different ways and it's hard not to pay attention to the high grade A5 wagyu beef. We started the meal with the hamachi shooters, a recently revised version of the original of which I saw pictures of on Bonnie L.'s blog. At $4 a piece, you actually get a comparable size of fish to that of a serving of two pieces or nigiri, so it's not a bad deal. The ginger foam, soy vinegar, tobiko and green onions offer the the perfect compliment to the buttery smooth hamachi. Just swirl (without splashing), and shoot! Larry ordered the better steak of the two with the NY strip prepared with a brown, savory sauce relative to my filet mignon with a tart green reduced, Asian influenced sauce (I forgot exactly what it was). My cut was prepared more medium well rather than medium rare but Larry's was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I only discovered my meat was a little overcooked underneath the sauce when I was already 3/4 done with it, so I didn't care to complain because it wasn't really bad, just not that great. On the side we had a order of truffle fries and aoili, but I can't remember which of the two varieties it was since the appetizer truffle fries are different. We capped the meal off with a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was nice and shallow with plenty of glazed top surface area and a few tart raspberries as garnish. Everything was served in good time and the staff was open for feedback every step along the way as they gave us two comment cards and pencils to jot any of our suggestions down on. With a $40 bottle of pinot noir, our mid-week spontaneous splurge ran $120.\n\nSteve, the manager but also one of the owners, came by our table to check in on us (in fact, he visited every single table from what we observed) and ask us what we thought of everything so far. He let us know briefly about some of the upcoming plans for the place and was curious as to know about how we found our way over here (I told him it was Tony from Zappos). He was very professional and down to earth, and he even offered to help me get into the Yelp Elite Party at 5A5 since I was on the waitlist at that time.\n\nAll in all, wagyu beef seems the best way to go here if you're looking for meat, and hamachi shooters should be a certain started. 5A5, hurry and get your menu posted online, we're waiting!\n\n4 dazzling stars!", "author": "Chelsea P."}

We got the $450 wagyu sampler which was great but two of the meats tasted like regular steak.  The wagyu rib eye tasted delicious, like no other steak. Rib cap number 2.  we also got regular filet mignon and rib eyes as backup steaks since the sampler portions are small. however their regular rib eye was gamey, I think we got a piece that was aged so much it had that musty rotten taste , I don't care for that.  On another visit I tried their prime rib and thought it was the best restaurant prime rib I've ever had , even better than House of Prime Rib.  Also the scallop appetizer was excellent .

They got the bar area right with the dark cherrywood and mood/ accent lighting.  When you walk into the circular dining area, the lights are on full blast, and the decor feels over done and very, well, Vegas-y. I felt like we were at Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace all over again.  The food is done well.  Our steaks were cooked with precision, but if you ask me, that's expected from a STEAKHOUSE.  My bone-in filet was tender, juicy and the sauce went well.  It is a definite journey from your classic steak preparation; I call it contemporary steak.  I much prefer a steak in it's own juices with some salt and pepper.  For the level of quality beef they are serving, it kind of puzzles me why they would mask the natural flavor of a great steak.\n\nOur server was not great.  It took 15 minutes after we ordered dinner and sides to get our wine order in, it took a tap on the arm to order a second glass for the Mrs. and I had to suggest ordering the red velvet souffl\u00e9 halfway through our entrees. At Roys, we would always offer the souffle when the diner was orderig entrees as they take 20 minutes to prepare.

The food is crazy! and the amount of pain on your wallet is F'n crazy!\n\nBut, true to its word this is maybe the only place outside of Japantown that serves GRADE 5 beef (Kobe Beef that is).\n\nI have to say the main draw is that this restaurant takes a lot of artistic and tasting palette chances, arranging different tastes together like an Iron Chef. But, I don't think that the portions are very much worth it. For a steak house you expect the steak that you get to be substantial and this is not. I do feel like I was ripped off a bit, even after ordering what I thought would be a sizable steak cut 14oz, but that was with a bone.\n\nI think if you had to come here on a company dinner meeting this place would be reasonable, otherwise I think you can do a little better.

In the morning, I told the cute building management guy from across the hall that I thought the construction going on (that makes horrendously shrill noises and shakes the entire office) sounded like velociraptors romping around, and that I wished it were true, 'cause obviously dinosaurs are awesome. He politely laughed, and then hightailed it out of there. Can't really blame him.\n\nThen in the afternoon, a wise-cracking coworker started making nicknames for everyone in my office. He challenged me to coin a new moniker for  him- but considering \"Berwanger\" is his last name, I just stammered and turned a nice crimson color. FML.\n\nNeedless to say, I was a little nervous to go to drinks with my friends at the new happy hour spot in the FiDi- especially when one of them warned me of the co-ed bathrooms...cause I was clearly battin' a thousand with members of the opposite sex.\n\nUpon walking in and perusing the menu, I realized that I could actually get behind this place- I mean, \"Steak Lounge\" is pretty awkward sounding, so that's a star right there for relating to me. The service and food was also gold-star worthy. Our waitress was personable (and bangin'), and brought a free round of champagne for the four of us upon learning I'd just celebrated a birthday- finally, I'd been singled out for something NOT humiliating! The owner, a friendly chap by the name of Steven, also came by to greet us, bringing with him four complimentary hamachi shooters. Two delicious freebies for the table? Hot damn, more stars for you!\n\nThe food was delectable (I tried the truffle oil fries and a burger served on a sweet roll) and we were all content with our wine selections. However, I'm leaving room for improvement here, because it's still in the \"soft opening\" phase, and they haven't set up a happy hour menu yet. While $8 for a mediocre glass of wine is standard for regular hours, I think they'd be wise to cut that price and add some discounted bites for the 5:00 crowd- at least that would be key to my continued patronage. \n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with my experience, and damn proud that I didn't have another \"OMFG\" moment... because those happen a lot.", "author": "Anna K."}

We came for a friend's birthday celebration on a Friday night.\n\nThe place itself is really nice, very sexy lighting. The wall panels are beautiful, love the way they layered the squares to give a very modern feel. The seats are comfy and nicely arranged. The bathroom is downstairs, shared male/female, clean. There is also a downstairs party/dinner area. The dance floor/bar is pretty small, got really crowded really fast, clean, not sticky. The drink prices were decent, I think about $7 for well drinks? Nice and strong, good value for the money. Bartenders are nice too, fast service.\n\nWe got here around 1030 and it was deserted. Then at 1130 it was like a wave of young financial district professionals just poured in. The crowd was a bit too formal for me, I couldn't really let loose. But not snobbish or anything, just not as relaxed as I like. \nThe DJ was ok, he played a pretty random mix of hip hop, rap, r&b, pop, 80s, classic rock. The transitions were choppy and we were left confused a few times, he also played Usher's \"oh my God\" twice... that's pretty much a no-no, right? Not that I have anything against the song, Usher's my man, ATL holla!!!! But seriously, don't play the same song twice.\nAll in all, we had a good time for my friend's birthday, he got mighty drunk and danced like a maniac, I don't think he even noticed how choppy the DJ was.", "author": "Mimi Z."}

The reservation was booked a month in advanced through Open Table for a 7:45 reservation. Since we run on Asian time Betty W. told us the reservation was at 7:30 so we would arrive early or on time--- We arrived on time. \n\nThere were two hostess when we walked in. One was wearing a extremely short mini dress, like she was about to go clubbing in Vegas and the other had crazy mangled lioness hair. Tim B. walked up to them to announce our arrival, the mini dress girl was just leaning against the wall the whole time not really giving a rat's a$$, the other was very unhelpful, first telling us we didn't have a reservation and then double checked and confirmed. Since we were waiting for one more for our party we were ushered to the bar area. We quickly browsed the drink menu and decided on a bottle of wine. We sat around waiting for our last guest and upon her arrival we informed the mangled lioness hair hostess that our whole party was here. She then led us to our table. We were seated in a decently size booth for our party of 5. We informed our hostess that we will need another glass for the wine. She gave us A DISGUSTED LOOK and walked away. REALLY!?! \n\nOur waitress soon came over and she was very nice! She went over the menu with us and described everything on the menu and answered all our questions. After careful consideration we decided to order the Hamachi Shooters, a Maguro Shooter, Truffle Fries (2), the Filet Mignon (3) and the Bone-in Ribeye (2), For sides we ordered the Sauteed Spinach, Mac & Cheese, and the Shrooms \n\nThe Shooters came out first and they were beautifully presented on grains of sugar and nicely presented in little shot glasses. You couldn't really shoot them like shots of vodka, utensils required. The shooters were all very delicious and had a lot of textures and heat. A great start.\n\nNext came the Truffle Fries....BOMB AMAZING! and the Sriracha aioili, GENIUS. \n\nNext came the rest of our entrees, the MEAT. All of the dishes were nicely presented. I had the filet mignon (med. rare) it came out a little too cooked, Amy L. requested hers medium but it was more bloody than mine. There wasn't a lot of \"sauce\" on the dish for dipping the meat and it was at some point a little too bloody for my liking. Our waitress came back a few times and checked on us to which we informed her that Amy L. wanted her steak a little more done. They had no problem taking it back and fixing it. When they brought it back it was re-garnished. YAY! \n\nThe birthday folk had the Bone-in Ribeye. That was 25oz. EACH! The amount of food was a little overbearing on the plate. I got to try a piece of the Ribeye and boy was it delicious! It was perfectly cooked! I would definitely get this next time.\n\nThe sides were decent, noting spectacular. \n\nWe informed our waitress that we were celebrating the Tim B. and Betty W.'s birthday so they brought out a beautiful plate full of chocolate writing and a piece of cake. \n\nAfter stuffing our faces and a couple glasses of wine we had to visit the facilities. The facilities were located downstairs...we were appalled by the conditions of the facilities. The dinning room was nice and clean but the facilities were dirty! It was dark and definitely neglected. \n\nStreet parking in the area may be hit or miss but there is valet and parking lots nearby. \n\nOverall, I would give 5A5 2 stars. -1 for the hostess and attitude we received, -1 for the food, -1 for the facilities.", "author": "Myron J."}

I get the whole steak lounge thing they are trying to make work here, the thing is, it doesn't work.  The place seems desperately trying to be New York hip, down to the little line things and bouncer at the front door - but it comes off being lame.  If they focused on one or the other, restaurant or lounge, it would probably be huge, but trying to be both a meat place and a meat market lacks the needed saltiness.\n\nThe front people should be fired.  They are aloof to the point of being rude.  My party of 4 was on time, and after letting them know, and being told we would be seated, part one of the male female team proceeds to seat 2 other parties while we stood there like morons.  I approached part 2 of the team, who immediately got defensive, telling me how he had not spoken to me, and they were busing as fast as they could, excuse excuse excuse., blah blah blah.\n\nWe went back to the bar.  Luckily the bartender was lovely; she made some great drinks and was very kind.  So we chit chatted, and after seating a few other parties, and about 20 minutes later, part 1 rolls by with a huffy sorry and leads us to our seats.  Our waitress did a quick pass by and immediately disappeared - she gets props for being cute, but not much else for her.  To her credit, the music was so loud, and her voice so soft, it was next to impossible to hear her.  Maybe I was put off by the rudeness of the front of the house, I am not sure as I was annoyed and not in a forgiving mood.\n\nThe shooters are fine, tasty. But fish shooters in a  steak house?  We also had some weird beef/avocado/jicama thing/take on a sushi roll - bad.  \n\nThe steaks are very expensive, and really not all that impressive.  $40 for just a steak is imho a crappy value.  You get a plate. some  ok sauce, and some meat.  Maybe a few onions if your lucky.  That is it.  All sides extra, and they are just ok.\n\nAnd though they claim the cuts are dry aged, I do not think they age them for too long, they seemed pretty fresh to me.\n\nListen, the bar scene seemed banging, plenty of pretty girls, and really badly dressed guys, and the drinks were decent.  But of you want a steak joint, you should go elsewhere.  Heck, Kokkari is right next door.  Eat some decent Greek food there, and just come her for the bar and club vibe.", "author": "Helmut S."}

It was a bit empty when we first arrived, but picked up a lot for the dinner crowd.  The drinks were nice - had a Kumquat and Pomegranate Fizz.  As well as a couple lime Kaffir Lime vodka shots which were surprisingly good.  To eat, we had poke shooters, truffle fries, mushrooms, and kobe sliders.  I had problems \"drinking\" the poke shooter and had to resort to a fork.  My favorite bite was the kobe sliders.  You don't even need the extra condiments they provide - tasty enough on its own.  Overall, it's a cool place to chill for a drink and small bites.  I'd like to try out a full dinner and get the A5 steak.  Heard a lot of raves about it.   \n\nOh - and for all you vain people (i.e. moi) the unisex bathroom has a mirror inside each bathroom stall.

Not wanting to club although not wanting to go to a bar we are in a dilemma. So lucky for me I have awesome friends like Tina to tell me that A5 is the latest and the greatest for exactly what we are looking for. Since we are celebrating Nancy's new job and its just a must.\n\nArriving about 11 we get there and head on in. Lots a peeps and a good looking crowd. We are instantly feeling good. We head to the bar order a round for us and a couple of former friends/coworkers. Service was prompt and didn't stand round long to get served. We decide what we would like a table but are informed that they are still clearing up after the dinner crowd but we could sit in the back. So we take a seat back there and however we didn't get much attention as in the way of a server we where soon relocated to a table on the main floor. Once this was done our sever was always around to make sure we had plenty of attention. Didn't get her name (cute blond haha) but she was great. We then drank the rest of the night and where in a drunk bliss. \n\nOverall this was a nice spot for what we where looking for. So if your in that transition stage where you don't want a club environment but still what a lively place to drink this is the spot. The music was great and the crowd was popping. Pricing for alki was as expected club pricing ($10 for  premium alki) Had a chance to look at the menu and it looked great so its on my list of future steak joints to try.

I just thought when you put sea bass next to wagyu beef, you'd expect the fish to be some prime chilean goodness. Nope.\n\nThe steak is solid but really, why is it precut? There's something sexy about methodically cutting your own steak. I usually like to carve around my steak until it forms the shape of California. Then I'll eat socal first because I'm not down with them. Yeah, can't do that here.\n\nThe Hamachi Shooter is quite good. Probably one of there best done dishes.\n\nThe deserts are also quite good, especially the apple ice cream tart thing (I can't remember, but the medley of warm apple tart with some kind of light ice cream on top was real tasty). The creme brulee was not as good.\n\nThe wine menu was quite good however my cocktail was quite a disappointment.

The hamachi shooters were delish, and it was hard to stop at just one - I seriously could have downed a half-dozen more!  Just perfect...and managed to make me even more hungry than I already was.  The entrees were well paced and arrived just in time.  My fish was just gorgeous, flaky, white, and moist, with a great mix of flavors.  I tasted my partner's steak and it was perfectly cooked and so tender - I am not usually a huge red meat fan but this dish could convert me.  We did not partake of the sides (around $7 each) but they looked good as well and included truffle fries and mashed potatoes.  Yum.\n\nOne of the owners came by to say hello which was a nice touch.  He told us about some of the new things they have in the works for the official opening, including a fireplace and smoking garden.  (I like the idea of a garden but if people are smoking, I'm not going anywhere near that.

The ribeye was nicely seared and wasn't burnt tasting at all. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms in sherry wine, it was a perfect pairing to our steak.

We told her that we were waiting for some people & she asked if we wanted to sit at our table; we opted to get a drink in the lounge area instead. We walked up to the bar & asked the bartender what drinks were on the menu & he stated that they had only created one drink so far the \"Pink Diamond.\" I ordered the \"Pink Diamond\" and my friend ordered a Whisky drink. The bartender had to go downstairs to get an orange to put in the Whisky drink...pretty sure he could have driven to an orchard and picked an orange in the amount of time it took. The other two in our party arrived and they ordered drinks, 10 minutes later we all had drinks in hand.\n\nThe atmosphere seems 70s inspired...the dining area has this huge ceiling that kind of looks like the back of a blow dryer; it was all lit up with pink lights. The booths were covered with fake crocodile leather & the chairs had white upholstered backs. There was a DJ booth in the front of the restaurant & they were playing music that was a little too loud. The front lounge was pretty cool, but I did not like the fact that the front window did not have curtains over it & that you could see Togo's across the street...not cool! I also think the big white thing over the bar needs some kind of pattern on it. The bathrooms downstairs are unisex, with ceiling to floor doors & a cool sink in the middle, definitely liked the bathroom!\n\nThe service...our server recommended things on the menu, but the wording was a little off \"if you want something on the healthier side....\" \"if you want something on the not healthy side...\" Ummmm...I guess I'm not going to order those fatty fries anymore, thanks server! The service seemed a little amateurish, kind of like they were new to the restaurant business...maybe they were. The bus people tried to take our plates away before we were finished & were not very discrete about walking by a lot. Our server definitely tried really hard, I think she was just nervous. Also the food was brought out in a weird order, the timing was definitely off...crab salad first, then shooters, then spinach side dish, then steak, then asparagus. Need to get the timing right.\n\nThe food:\n\nCrab salad: I do not like crab & I liked this dish more than anyone else at the table. Maybe it was due to the fact that you couldn't taste the crab! The citrus dressing & avocado covered up the crab taste. I actually kind of liked this dish.\n\nHamachi shooters: cool idea, but executed poorly. It was impossible to actually \"shoot\" the shooters, it was more like a bit that you had to chew for a few seconds before swallowing. They were not bad, but also not great. They could have used a little less soy sauce. I actually liked these even though they were small.\n\nNew York Strip Steak: was served on a plate in tiny slices that looked like tuna tartar. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) & was served with two good sauces, I enjoyed this dish the most out of all the things we ordered. It was a small dish though.\n\nSpinach: I liked the spinach, was not over/under cooked & had a good flavor.\n\nAsparagus: was cooked the right amount, not amazing, but I liked it.\n\nDesserts: the desserts were disappointing. Out of the 3 choices, there was nothing with chocolate!! The mixed berries were good, but very plain & did not have as much grand Marnier as I would had liked. The other dessert kind of tasted like toothpaste, with a balsamic meringue type thing & strawberries...it was kinda weird.\n\nIt was $45 each for not that much food & only 2 drinks each (and that was with \"discounted\" pre grand opening prices). I know that it is pre grand opening, but they said they are opening in a week & I can't imagine it will dramatically improve in only a week. The menu was also kind of all over the place...they had fried chicken, steak, fish, shooters, stick with one thing and own it! A5 definitely has potential...since they are still in their Pre Grand Opening phase, hopefully they can still make some changes for the better. I will probably come back for happy hour (hopefully they will have a good one!), but most likely not dinner.", "author": "Elaine S."}

The one was very good and marbled, the other had no marbles at all and was like a different Steak and almost tasteless.

Then the waitress pushed deserts on us that where ok as well.

It's already been stated in some of the other reviews that this location used to be the old Frisson restaurant, which I never got a chance to experience.  \n\nIt's not your typical steakhouse, but more of a steakhouse/lounge.  Think slightly smaller dining area and slightly bigger bar area up at the front.  It's a perfect area for coming in for a few drinks and maybe a hamachi shooter or two.  If you opt for a more traditional sit down dining experience, there are a bunch of tables set up in the central area, with a variety of comfy booths and white suede chairs.\n\nThe food sampling was limited on this trip, but we got to try the truffle oil drizzled fries and some NY steak.  The fries were great and I can see this becoming a hit.  The steak was very tender, but maybe could have used a bit more seasoning.  It's still the soft opening phase, so I am sure they are working on it.\n\nThe restrooms are a bit different than any that I've been to before.  It's a co-ed restroom.  Think of a large room, with private stalls all along the outside.  In the middle, a long sink for everyone to use.  I had no problem with it, but it might make you do a double take the first time you're in there.\n\nI am anxious to go back in mid-March when they are totally open for business.  I do love a good steak, so I am crossing my fingers that this place will deliver.", "author": "Wade Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-08", "description": "Based on the reviews, my expectations were high on this joint. The actuality is that my experience fell way below the bar of my expectations. \n\nI did not really enjoy this place, for many reasons. \n\nThe occasion was for my Gf's birthday. I wanted a romantic dinner at an upper end restaurant which boasted their reputation on the notion that they were a contemporary take on the steak house. \n\nThe ambiance: \nThe interior design of the place is appealing to the eye, however the noise level hurt my ears. To note, as we were trying to have a romantic dinner, we were seated next to a family that consisted of two parents, two young children (2-5 yrs old) and a nagging mother in law. Because the noise level was already loud, the family specifically the wife felt the need to yell at the top of her lungs when speaking to her family. Her children were out of control and were yelling in unison with the mother. It completely killed the vibe of the dinner. \n\nThe food: The reviews were right on with the Truffle fries. They were the best part of the dinner. Very addictive and rich in flavor. If I did come back here, I would just go the bar for an order of fries and a beer. I would not waste my time on their main courses which were lack luster. I'm a steak man who believes in the simplicity on how a steak is prepared and cooked. The flavor of the steak rests on the grade and brand of meat combined with very basic seasonings (salt, pepper, herbs). I ordered the bone in NY steak, medium rare. It was a disgrace to the STEAK. It was drenched in a mushroom sauce that by itself had flavor but completely overpower the flavor of the steak itself. How could you do that to a STEAK? Pitiful. On top of that, they cooked my steak a bloody rare rather than medium. I initially attempted to eat the steak RARE, but it got to the point that my plate was covered in blood and I could see the deep purple of the meat. I eventually sent it back and they returned the same steak supposedly cooked medium rare. IT WASN'T. STILL RARE. My GF ordered the expensive Wagyu beef that was double digits by the ounce. Same compliant, for a piece of beef that expensive and rich in flavor by itself, why the need to cover it in sauce. The Wagyu beef was buttery and had tremendous flavor, however, the price was not worth it. NO GO on the FOOD. \n\nLastly, as this was my GF's birthday, I called for reservations and indicated the occasion. They told me that they would accommodate the occasion and even would provide a complimentary birthday dessert. The day of the dinner, I called to confirm the reservation and the occasion. They once again indicated that they would accommodate her birthday and provide a dessert. When the end of dinner came along, no dessert was provided nor an indication from the staff or waiter of my Gf's birthday. Since I was already disappointed with the food and the restaurant, I did not bother to complain. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: If your looking for a place to take your significant other for a romantic dinner or for a bday, DONT GO HERE. If your looking to enjoy a good high end priced steak and flavorful and rich food, DONT GO HERE. If you do go here, go to the bar and order a beer and their truffle fries. Your check will be less and you will not at least be disappointed. \n\n5A5 Steak lounge, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. \n\nI'll get off my soap box now.", "author": "T.S. K."}

Also, the food is very over-priced as well. If you want a good steak with good sides, go to Ruth Chris steak house instead or go to Izzy's steak house on Lombard/Steiner up near pacific heights.

I heard they changed their chef so this review may not apply as much.  Just a simple disclaimer!\n\nIf you're going to name your steakhouse '5A5' - you better have DA BOMB red meat.  High expectations for the food - but was heavily disappointed.  Meat was overcooked, tasted a bit too seared and the sides were just ok.  \n\nI like the ambiance..although the whole dining and watching people drink @ the bar is a little different.  I feel like they could have separated that a bit better.  \n\nI like the music there and if you get the right bartender drinks are quite stiff.  Yay!  \n\nI did have an issue once where a buddy of mine couldn't get in with his chuck taylors.  The door guy was a real jerk about it.  I understand, but a few weeks back they allowed people to wear whatever shoes they wanted.  I suppose there was a change in policy to uphold the branding/imaging/type of crowd they wanted in there and to keep riff-raffs out.  Nonetheless, it was annoying to still see some folks in there with tennis shoes while my buddy was stuck outside while I said happy bday to the birthday girl.", "author": "Yup S."}

The owners and even the main cook was checkin up on us and asking how everything was so that was really nice. \nYou have to try the Hamachi shooters. if they were $3 a pop in the beginning that's great but as of the last time i was there, they're now $4 a pop. but worth a try still. Prices weren't as high as i thought they were goin to be. but if you want a side with your main dish like spinach or mushrooms that'll be another $8 or $9. Get the mac & cheese! Sea bass was really good too. I'm definitely goin back to try their steak and hopefully they'll have their service on track.", "author": "Lester A."}

They have a separate dining area positioned in a circular sectioned off area in the middle of the venue, and a lounge area right next to the bar and DJ booth.  The back bar design is a moving hologram of an open fire pit that ties in with what I'm almost certain is an actual line of an open flame at entrance.  \n\nBar is well-staffed (especially considering I don't think it ever gets that busy, nights with events aside).  \n\nIt's obvious that its target group is a swankier set of folks.

Sometimes service for large parties can be poor since they know they are getting an automatic 18% but this wasn't the case at all!  \n\nThis location was the old Frisson and they didn't make any changes , but none were realy necessary truthfully as this place is ultra chic.  The large cirlce booths, the fire in the lounge, the circular ceilings make it feel very Manhattan Chic.  \n\n  The food was fantastic.  We all ordered steaks.  I liked that they had different portion sizes so I could try what I wanted, but didn't feel gluttoness about ordering a huge piece of meat I really didn't like.  We  all started with salads.  Both the Ceasar and the wedge were awesome!  We ordered sides of the truffle fries which are to die for with a spicy Aoli, corn that was so light and sweet that I could have had 3 plates, the mac and cheese which was an enormous portion.  The fingerling potatoes were the only thing that I thought were just ok.  I  would definitely love to come back and try the Wagyu!\n\nThe restaruant was very accomodating.  We were running a bit behind, and called ahead to let them know.  They were very pleasant over the phone, unlike many restaurants could be.  This was a great find and we had an amazing time.  My only complaint is that we brought in 2 magnums of wine and were charged corkage fee for 4 bottles.  I thought this was a bit petty.

Otherwise, HH food is limited to: shooters, truffle fries, chicken yakitori, and whatever is the special of the day. We went on Wednesday so we got $1 oysters. Not bad! The 2 for $5 hamachi shooters were presented quite nicely but ultimately I don't think it's a must-try. The best food in our HH selection was definitely the truffle fries with sriracha aioli. I normally think truffle oil is a little too rich and especially on fries is really intense, but these were on point! They are plump fries and can be delicious with or without the dipping sauce. I love aioli and I love the contrast of the creamy cold sauce with the hot greasy fry. Mmm. We got 2 orders among 4 people and demolished both baskets.  If you are not trying to shave a few years off of your life, then just share one basket.\n\nThe drinks are $5 (drink of the day, champagne, house wine). J and I ended up both ordering one cocktail (orange vodka with orange raspberry juice? IDEK) which we decided was VERY strong and delicious. Then we moved onto 2 glasses of champagne each. The champagne was pretty tasty and made us very happy. \n\nWe then moved from the lounge to the dining area. The bread selection was good. Well, there were only 2 types: bacon bread and some sort of rustic bread. Of course I dug into the bacon bread, which turned out to be disappointingly bland and soft and just plain odd. I did not care for this one very much. The seemingly boring bread was marvelous, though. This goes to show that first impressions are not always accurate. \n\nJ and I shared the 15oz Prime Rib, which was cut in three 5oz slices. It was so good that several times I neglected my true love, the horseradish. I feel guilty confessing this.\n\nSo why only 3 stars. WELL. Their mushrooms were salty as F. It was like they marinated the mushrooms in salt, cooked it in salted butter, then when it was hot, decided to throw all the mushrooms around in a salt bath before serving it. Maybe the chef was crying and his salty tears also went into the dish? Maybe our server was having a bad day and sobbed into our mushrooms? Maybe the people who harvested the mushrooms were also crying tears of salt? Wow. I have never had anything so salty in my life and I hope to never have it again. $12 to force mushrooms down my gullet...just no. Tried rolling it around in my steak-blood-sauce to mask the saltiness to no avail. Ugh just thinking about these mushrooms makes me want to detract another star.\n\nAnyway 5A5 is a decent steakhouse but why wouldn't you just go to Alexander's? \n\nAVOID THE MUSHROOMS AT ALL COSTS.

Well this place offers french bread with bacon bits.  Yes, meat in the bread.  Winning...\nAppetizer was a raw meat, sashimi-style, steak tartare skewers.  Very good.\nAfter discussing the cuts with waitress, I chose small cuts of the filet and the ribcap.\nBoth were as tender as meat gets but the ribcap...the ribcap was unlike any meat cut I've ever tasted.  Literally, soggy bread soft and juicy.  Very, very deliciously unique and worth the visit.  The sides were a blur compared to the meat but still tasty.

While the ambiance is great and service shined, there were a few hicups that put a damper on the experience.  I was seated in a chair at our table. Some tables have a half booth and two chair setup and they are at an angle. My seat was constantly being bumped by the waitress and the other staff who were serving the table next to us.  I told my waitress who informed the other waitress - who then apologized.  That was appreciated except there are a total of 4-6 people who \"work\" your table and others continued to bump. Next issue was that my brother tried to order the Prime Rib and they were already out of it at 7pm.  I though this odd as they are a steakhouse.  But what really broke up the flow of the dinner was my steak.  I asked for my filet to be butterflied and well done.  It arrived pink.  So while my steak had to be sent back to be brought up to well, the rest of my party enjoyed their meal.  I got my steak when they were finishing.  The steak was good with a lot of great flavors, but I've had better in San Francisco.

Miracles really can happen if you close your eyes and wish upon a star.\n\nOk, so this place was filled with ugly dudes.  I think Colonel Sanders was there, but isn't he dead?  So yeah, this place attracts ugly dudes, nerds and a dead man who cooked up some fried chicken.\n\nAll the happy hour drinks and fare are $5.  The truffle fries are amazing.

It still looks like the former Frisson, but less \"red\" and a bit brighter -- maybe too bright. The layout is a bit off putting, maybe that's why Frisson tanked eventually. Bad decor and so-so food is not a promising combination. The service was great, but unfortunately that cannot carry a restaurant to success, especially in SF when there are so many great places. \n\nFood: OK, nothing spectacular. It reminded me too much of the dinners I would have on a business trip at the hotel. \nAtmosphere: Felt like a hotel lounge/restaurant. The bar back drop is an enormous lighted wall, that seemed to light up the entire place. It felt like someone turned on the house lights after the partying or performance was over. \nService: Very attentive, maybe too much. There were so many different servers coming up to our table that I felt like the mafia. It was too overwhelming. \n\nOddly enough, no one really reviews some of the other things about a restaurant, like place setting, cutlery, stem/glassware. I had the fillet and yet they gave me the dullest steak knife ever. I believe it could have very well been a butter knife. It was very strange for a steakhouse to have such poor and inadequate cutlery. I was looking around to see whether it was just our table, but it appeared that everyone else had the same knife. One should never have to saw into their fillet. \n\nThe entire place was odd. It lacked energy and I suppose you can describe the food as being equally flat and uninspiring. It wasn't horrible, it was just too much like eating at a hotel. I am not sure if I would come back. They also need to do something about the DJ booth. It really doesn't help the already suffering aesthetics of the place. The bathroom is a dark dank cavernous dungeon -- a unisex one at that. It's somewhere you would lure someone down into if you wanted mug or assault them. I was hoping post Frisson...they would have significantly try to improve the restroom as priority! \n\nIn summary, I left there a bit confused, as I wasn't sure if it wanted to be a nightclub, a restaurant, a lounge, or a hotel restaurant. It seems like its all those things mashed into one. I probably would consider giving it another star or 1/2 star at best, if the food was outstanding but even that failed to impress. So, 3 stars is a generous rating.", "author": "Tonia D."}

I picked the Ribeye for the entre...it was actually a giant piece of steak. I was pretty surprised at how big the chunk of meat was. The waitress suggested that we order a side dish since the entre is pretty much just a slab of meat. We got the truffle mac and cheese and this was AMAZING!!!! i LOOOVE truffle and the mac had gruyere (another one of my favorite cheeses).

Those traditional kind of places make me feel somewhat out of place, like I  need to be part of a rich old white man club to be dining there  (no offense to those who are). I'm anything but.  5A5 brings a whole lot of class and sophistication - steaks done trendy and of course deliciously. \n\nThe restaurant has two distinct  rooms. One is for dining, which we sat under this circular mass of lights. I couldn't help up but look up at the ceiling from time to time to admire the decor. The room was also  lined with white couch like seats. It has great ambiance and really sets the mood for an intimate dinner.  The other room is dimly lit with candles for the bar/lounge area.  Don't know what it is about that lounge, but I'd have to describe it sexy-cool. \n\n*Hamachi Shooters:  You can taste the freshness of the hamachi and bold Asian taste\n\n*4oz Australian F1 \"kobe\" steak: I had stopped eating land meat for 8 months before. And after eating this melt in your mouth steak... don't think I could ever do that again. It was an AMAZING steak, the best I've ever had! \n\n*10oz Buffalo fillet:  Just a tad bit over cooked for a medium rare, but it was still tasty. The Australian was the winner steak of the 2.\n\n*Mushroom medley:  I'm a mushroom lover, so it was all delicious to me!  But, I thought it was a tad bit over priced. \n\n*Mac & Cheese: It was creamy and very very rich. I loved the use of  different cheeses rather than just the standard American.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get to try their dessert (I was eying on the chocolate toffee bread pudding) because we had to catch our Wicked showing. Our server and hostess had called for a taxi cab to show up at the restaurant at 7:30 so we could get to the Orpheum on time.  Cab showed up promptly.  It was a great dining experience from start to finish. \n\nRecommendations:\n- FYI - If you plan on getting a Ribeye, it takes 30 minutes to cook \n- Perfect place for special occasions (about $100/person to dine)\n- Go for happy hour at the lounge, and then sit down for dinner after - save a bit on drinks and experience both lounge and dining area\n- Steaks done medium rare is the way to go", "author": "Kathy D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-12", "description": "I would have to agree that the Hamachi Shooters and the Crab salad were really good but for a steakhouse and considering that it's A5 grade meat the steak was a huge disappointment.  \n\nSTEAK:  First of all someone had not properly trimmed the steak.  New York should have an entire side with fat but mine was sporadic and not all the skin was removed making it very tough.  (Cooks will understand what I mean.)  The meat was really chewy cooked medium rare and with very little natural flavours.  This is A5 grade Wagyu beef or that's what we were told.  It should cut like butter and only need small amount of seasoning to enhance it's perfect blend of meat and fat.  None of that was present.  It was like a steak you would pick up at a local grocery store.  I'm a bit harsh but this is a steakhouse that serves the highest grade of Japanese beef available in the US.  \n\nSEA BASS:  My girlfriend had the bass and it was perfectly cooked.  Very fresh, light and flaky it was delicious.  \n\nIt's a good thing they don't open for another 3 weeks to work out the kinks.  I'd go back but probably be in the bar sticking to the appetizers and fish.  Definitely order the Hamachi Shooters.  Oh yeah, service was pretty good and they didn't change a lot from the hip Fission decor.", "author": "Suz L."}

Let me start with the happy hour...  We had some of the shooters... great way to start off our meal.  We also had their specialty cocktail that day for $5...  don't remember what it was since my friend ordered it for me, but it was delish!  Then I checked in for our 7pm reservation for 3 ppl... to our surprise, we weren't listed in their system even though I distinctly remembered calling in.  But they are really good at working with glitches, because even tho they couldn't find my reservations, they went ahead and seated me right away, even though the restaurant was packed!!  I was impressed!  Then we ordered off their DAT menu... I had the spare ribs and my hubby had the new york strip.  Both were excellent, altho I preferred his more than mine!  The soup was very very good.  Chef also gave us this small soup starter which was tasty... as well as these small limey shots that were also delish.  We ordered a side of grilled veggies which really hit the spot... there just was no \"miss\" in our dinner.  I would say the only thing to know is that if you order the ribs or steak, ask for bread or order more sides because your plate comes with JUST the steak.  There are no potatoes, no veggies, no sides whatever to accompany your meal.  Some ppl like that I suppose, but I'm a carb addict, so I had to ask for bread, which they promptly brought.  Dessert was pistachio cake and choc mousse, both were excellent but I thought the pistachio was better... [i can have choc mousse anywhere].  \n\nAll in all, I would def rec to others... and will prob be back myself.  Cheers!", "author": "T C."}

The only they got going for them is location and nice decor. \n\nFirst off, the bouncer wouldn't let my boyfriend in because there was a \"dress code\" and he had on sneakers. I think it's just straight discrimination because my bf is this tall black man and the rest of the Asian/White-crowd with their sneakers on came on in with no problem. \n\nSecond,  I had a TWELVE dollars Cherry Crush that barely had any alcohol in it. I just expected a more original, classy, or at least delicious drink for something that cost more than 10 bucks, but nope, just something with a hint of cherry and a little too sweet for my taste. \n\nLast, and the most important, the music (spinning Top 40 I think) was only alright. I'm the kind of person who likes to be at a place where people actually dance and look like they are enjoying their time. Most of the crowd just look on and waited for the party to start.

I ordered a Tito's on rocks and was lack luster due to one shot along with a square ice cube in a glass.  Due to way they cut their ice cubes they said they could not fit more cubes so if you drink something on the rocks, beware.  I ordered the Caesar salad and free range chicken since I was not in mood for red meat even though the beef selections looked good.  The Caesar was well prepared and presented and the dressing excellent as it goes for Caesar however the Caesar did not receive a five star due to the croutons.  They were average and if they present a homemade thicker garlic crouton, this salad would have been awesome.  Sorry, I am quite the Caesar critic.  The chicken was good but nothing spectacular.

It was definitely a spare no expense overhaul of the building's design. The bar/lounge area is immediately inside the front door and is very nice and very spacious. The dining room is curved with an interesting round fixture in the ceiling that strangely reminded me of a planetarium. The tables and furniture had an interesting art deco look.\n\nThe service was very good, and the chef came out to give us complimentary hamachi shooters (could this be due to the special menu and event??). The shooters were really good. When we asked our server what the restaurant's name represented, he called over a colleague to explain thoroughly about A5 being the highest grade of beef in the world. Which brings me to the food.\n\nI started with the beet salad with caciotta al tartufo (black truffle infused cow's milk cheese), which was really, really good. We all had the filet mignon (would you really consider getting chicken or fish at a steakhouse?). It was done in a sage sauce with shiimeji mushrooms, prosciutto, and capers. The prosciutto made the sauce a bit too salty for my taste, but it was still amazing. We shared a bunch of side dishes, including truffle oil, 3-cheese mac and cheese, which was so incredible I'm going to try to replicated it (I love me some truffle oil!). We also had asparagus in a parmesan sauce and corn with edemame. \n\nNow, my loyal readers know that I am all about the dessert. What point is there in eating if the dessert isn't going to be great? I must say that I was a bit disappointed with the lack of creativity of the dessert selection we had, although I'm sure there are more on the regular menu. We had a chocolate torte with orange sorbet and a citrus cheesecake with candied something or other on top. Both were OK, but I wasn't wowed. \n\nThe restaurant's menu is very impressive with several cuts of dry aged beef and Kobe style beef from Japan and Australia. Of course, to try a sampling of Kobe from Japan, Australia, and the US will set you back $125. The prices seem reasonable for the quality of the food and the location of the restaurant. I can't speak for the wine list since we had bottomless champagne with our event (and by the time we ate--about 10pm--I would have fallen asleep in my chocolate torte if I had any wine. I'm so old.).\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back if I wanted to splurge a bit on a great dinner with nice ambiance.", "author": "Amy B."}

Started with shooters which were ok, the Hamachi was better than Maguro. Caesar salad was drenched in dressing and lettuce was huge, not a nice presentation. We also ordered the kobe beef sashimi and it was extremely chewy and not good with the mushrooms they wrap it with. Main course I chose was prime rib. Being a 'steakhouse' you would expect awesome meat, well, not here. First of all, 6 of us ordered prime rib and they only had 4 left to make 2 people switch without any other type of courtesy. Usually they will extend their apologies, not here. If you are a steakhouse and run out of meat, theres a problem. Second, I could barely taste the meat itself from the overkill of peppercorn they surrounded it with. Third, it stated with horseradish on the menu, that never came with anyones plate. Fourth, the meat was full of fat. Lastly, the sides were so bland, you would only eat them if you were starving. The green beans had no flavor, just steamed and not crunchy; soggy. The mashed potato had no garlic or any butter flavor, tasted like boxed mashed, however, ive had better box tasting mash. The friend who changed to the NY strip said our prime rib tasted better than his steak, which was cold. I can only imagine how bad his steak was if mine was already not up to par. Dessert: was plain, chocolate cake with some marshmallow tasting cream on top. Let me just say no one at my table of 10 finished it and it was only a 2x2 cube. \n\nThey get one star because you can't give 0. Noise level in here was extremely high and we could barely hear our waiter cuz he would just talk normal. If the noise level is that high and you don't want to scream at us, you should talk to each side of the table. \n\nMind you that they required us to have a $1000 MINIMUM to even make a reservation, which is ridiculous for the food we had. You would think for that much your food and presentation better be damn good. Well, not here. You can go to ANY other steakhouse and have better service, food and still have money in your pocket. \n\nWe also stayed for the \"lounge\" they have afterwards, go somewhere else. Place is tiny with only 30-40 yr old men hovering over the dance area 'lounging'. I should also mention their unisex bathroom downstairs which seems like they're too small or too cheap to make 2 separate ones. I'm sorry, but I'd like to 'freshen up' without a man washing his hands behind me staring at my a** while I do it. There's a reason women like their privacy. \n\nObviously, I would never come here again. I suggest one no come either. Go to House of Prime Rib, Harris, or Mortons for good steak or prime rib. These new restaurants think they can charge up the a** just because of decor and stuck up customers, I can't wait for these places to close down due to their lack of food preparation and presentation skills.", "author": "S L."}

I know it was a \"soft\" opening... but if you're going to open to the public, expect to be able to service them. \n\nThe food was OK... nothing to write home about though I did like the hamachi shooters. That was a nice bite (or three). During a soft opening, the kitchen should be getting it's timing down and minor guffaws are to be expected. \n\nService, however, should not be a question, especially at the bar. And especially not at a long bar where bartenders should have easily visibility to their patrons. I was glad to get my drink (eventually) and I saw clusters of people waiting WAY to long to get theirs. And really not people you'd expect to wait that long (cute girls, non-douchey-looking guys). They either need to train their bar staff better, or move to four bartenders. \n\nWhen this place was called Frisson... it was really quite good. Dinners were good and the space was relatively unique. I don't know what they expect to accomplish in the next week... but about the only thing I observed that was different was the fake-croc upholstery on the booths. The rest of the color scheme seemed the same.  For those who have been to South Beach, the color scheme and look is kind of like Sushi Samba on Lincoln Mall... minus the hustle-bustle restaurant part.\n\nThe bathroom... whoa! They need some work down there... since it's a coed bathroom with shared stalls, they probably need to allot more time to maintenance or there are going to be some severely grossed out female patrons. Yes I realize many girls do the \"hover\"... but as the old service industry saying goes, \"we aim to please, so you aim too, please\"... well that was not happening. And given bottle service and drunken crowds, I can't imagine the situation getting better over the course of a busy weekend night. \n\nThe crowd overall was NOT too enticing. It was very homogeneous... a few Latino guys, but a predominantly young, Asian crowd. The music wasn't all too creative and I really hope they do better over time or I doubt they'll last. These crowds are fickle. \n\nYes, yes... I know it was a soft opening, and I've been to others.

Hands down the best ever.  The Wagyu filet was one of those things I just had to try once in my life and the key word there is \"once\".  For $20/ounce, it was unbelievably tender, but I have had almost as tender filets in other top end steakhouses in the country at 1/4 of the cost and 4X the size.  So that alone makes me rate this 3 stars.  Bottom line was the beef was really good, but not that good ($80 for 4oz)?!  Anyway, if you are in to that kind of thing then you'll love it.  I guess being from the Midwest, and having high end beef/steakhouses everywhere, I wasn't impressed.  I would have much preferred spending my $180 on some kickass sushi.", "author": "Bryan H."}

Spacious, ample seating, but relatively empty on a Thursday night which was conducive to our girl's night out. We were on a mission, taking no prisoners. Perfect for loud, squealing chatter and good libations sans audience or persistent douchebaggy men.\n\nHH prices are $5 for well-drinks, champagne, and house wines. Cocktails average $10 / pop. I had the Pineapple & Pear Martini which is Grey Goose-based, fruity concoction with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Strangely delicious, yet on the smaller side - it was maybe 75% the size of your full-sized martini glass. However, it had the kick I was looking for and it wasn't watered down. If you're a lightweight like me, then you are good.\n\nThursday nights are the best night to go - $1 oysters!!! It comes with a droplet of cocktail sauce, served organically on a bed of rock salt. YES!!!\n\nI also ordered the Kobe Sliders. One order gets you 2 tiny little burgers (think baby burgers from BKing). However, to their credit, they were delicious! Juicy, comes with fries, served on an onion roll with your choice of Gruyere or Cheddar. \n\nThe grilled pepper things are good too - they were sort of like Anaheim Chile peppers (which are not spicy at all) that were grilled and covered in rock salt. Very good too, and a good divergence from edamame which has oversaturated most bar menus as of late.\n\nRestrooms are co-ed. I'm sure some immature guys and girls may have some fun with that. Risque.

I went to 5A5 six months back on a business dinner and liked it very much.  I think the atmosphere and bar are great, and the \"lounge-y\" vibe is neat for San Francisco which does not have a lot of places like this. I decided to go again when my husband and I had friends in town. Suffice to say if I had reviewed based on my first visit, this would be far more positive feedback.  The first time we had great waiter, good food and overall good if not hugely memorable visit. The second time was beyond a disaster.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and steaks all around.  One appetizer (waygu shooters, very good) showed but no others. Suddenly the steaks were on the table! We sent them back, 15 minutes later got the appetizers - no explanation but also all very good.  Steaks were then brought back and get this, WILDLY undercooked.  I like a very pink/red medium rare and this thing was jelly like and beet red on the plate.  My husband had same problem. Huh? They had two shots at getting this right and totally missed the mark.   The waiter was all over the place and while pleasant and apologetic did nothing to head off issues.  The steaks came back again after another 20 minutes and manager came over and STOOD OVER US as we tasted the second firing to make sure it was ok - this might be seen as good service by some but we thought it was annoying; perhaps it was just his demeanor while he did it that was so off.  Anyway, no discount applied at all.\n\nAnyway, I do agree with other reviews,  everything is good here BUT FOR the steak, which makes no sense at all.  Will not be going back. At least not for steak...\n\nPS The Monday wine special is a great deal - second bottle is 1/2 off on ANY bottle on the menu, so if you have a special occasion, want lots of good appetizers, give it a shot on a Monday.", "author": "Kirsten M."}

I specifically went here for dinner and did feel slightly overdressed in my dress as I watched a party of 3 saunter pass my table in jeans, sneakers and hoodies. But gladly, the ratio of dressy to casual was probably the whole restaurant to 3 so that wasn't so much of a big deal.\n\nI absolutely loved 5A5 Steak Lounge, from their food, to their decor/atmosphere and even their co-ed bathrooms. Initially I wanted to celebrate my birthday here, but unfortunately his birthday precedes two weeks before mine, which meant the idea of eating at 5A5 Steak Lounge was still a definite possibility, but that the check would be breaking my pockets instead. Wah.\n\nActually I'd like to take that \"wah\" back because 5A5 was definitely amazing and worth every penny that came out of my pocket that night. This restaurant was definitely just my type. I didn't necessarily want to go to a fancy steakHOUSE, rather somewhere more modern and sexy like a lounge that serves steak... and wouldn't you know it, 5A5 happens to fulfill that requirement. As a matter of fact, I think 5A5 is the first restaurant to coin the term steakLOUNGE because I've never heard of such a thing. I mean who really besides a hardcore carnivore like myself wants to lounge around with steak?\n\nAnyway, I didn't try the hamachi shooters like everyone else, but I did taste those truffle fries. I didn't really taste the \"sriracha\" in the aioli, however the aioli was still delicious. I actually used it to dip just about everything in-- my fries, my bread (oh! That bacon infused bread was amaze), my steak, my fingers, etc. I'm surprised I didn't even finish my fries. For my main course, I had the 6 oz. filet mignon. I actually thought I wasn't going to get full because 6 oz. sounds so tiny and even looked tiny, but much to my surprise I didn't even finish it! I had 3 more bites left on that bad boy, but the fries, bread and my side dish of mashed potatoes (which I must say was tasty, except for those candied bacon chunks. Our server called them bacon bits, but they were actually jumbo sized bits, hence bacon chunks) made me unbelievably full. Perhaps the only disappointment from 5A5 was how their food quickly made me so full. I was hoping to have a serious feast, but that idea was cut short halfway through my main course.\n\nOur server was great. He gave us helpful recommendations for drinks and attended to us promptly. However, I don't recall him introducing himself to us when he first graced our table. We didn't really know what to call him, so we decided he looked like a Greg and referred to him as Greg our server the whole night.

Don't get me wrong, we had a great night, but the consensus amongst a few of us was that we were confused as to what this place was trying to be.  Yes I get that it's a lounge but the set up for it to turn into a more club/bar-ish atmosphere as it gets later into the night is a bit hard to work with, starting with the fact that it feels kind of weird to have a whole bunch of people standing around drinking and talking while some people less than 2 feet away are trying to get their groove on.  So what is it?  A dance floor?  A lounge where we're all standing and drinking?  Secondly, I got a lemon drop (hey, it's supposed to be a lounge right?  I can order girly drinks here without being teased) but it was terrible.  I couldn't finish it.  It honestly tasted like lemon scented cleaning fluid in a martini glass.  Ended up being a waste of money as I couldn't even get other people to drink it.

For some reason the our soup was a tad bit on the cold side when it was served. The truffle fries were okay (I had better), my 2 year old daughter seemed to like them a lot, but then again she likes all kinds of fries. Then came the steaks; the dry aged t-bone was a bit dry cooked at medium rare but the flavor was good even though it  was a tad under seasoned in my opinion. The wagyu was pretty moist and buttery but not worth $19/ ounce. I've had wagyu way more buttery than this for cheaper elsewhere. The sauce they served it with kind of masks the flavor of the wagyu as well.  The cream corn we ordered as a side dish was bland and tasteless, needless to say we didn't enjoy it.\n\nThe Decor:\n  The decor is really nice, it looks like a upscale modern club joint. The type of joint one finds in Vegas. Half open kitchen set behind a round dining area, very chic. Too bad the food doesn't match up to the beauty of this place.\n\nThe Service:\n  The service here was excellent. Our server greeted us right away with a big smile. She explained the menu from top to bottom and let us know right away which items were out. Our ice teas and waters were always refilled promptly. Food was served pretty quickly as well. I think the service was so speedy because they didn't have many customers at the time, I peered into the kitchen and some of the staff were standing around playing on their phones.\n\nThe Summary:\n  Like Alexander's this place was just okay for me. Many flavors seemed too familiar to me since I've dined at Alexanders a few times. The execution in some dishes were bad and other dishes were done correctly but not great. I definitely recommend a steak lover to try it but best steakhouse in SF? I don't think so. From now on, I've told myself I'm just going to buy wagyu online and cook it myself at home.", "author": "Stanley C."}

I met up with friends for a birthday dinner around 8:30 on a Friday. When we got there, the bar area was packed with people who looked like they came from work and others who were really dressed up. Seems like a great happy hour hangout. Dinner was pretty good, but not worth the high price. I tried the Australian Kobe, which was tender and the perfect size for my appetite. The rib eye was chewy. Truffle fries tasted like plain old french fries. Save your money for something else, like the mac n cheese. The music was a bit too loud during dinner where I almost had to yell to talk to the person next to me.\n\nThe lounge: I had heard great things, but that night was a total disappointment. I had specifically asked the person taking my reservations what kind of music the dj was going to be spinning that night, and she had informed me it would be top 40, hip hop, and techno. I like lounging/dancing to hip hop & top 40, and is the reason why I chose this place. But she obviously didn't know what she was talking about and all they played was techno. We headed over to the bar area after dinner, it was after 11:30 and the whole area was dead. No one sitting on the couches, just two girls dancing.\n\nThe interior design was definitely nice, but I noticed that the flame near the entrance was never turned on that night.", "author": "Starla L."}

We decided to choose cuts that we don't regularly choose, with the hopes that 5A5 would open our eyes with cuts that we're not as familiar with. We were very pleasantly surprised. We went with Wagyu Shooters to start, and that in itself was heavenly. You could feel the delicate texture of the Wagyu, as well as taste the freshness of the meat, and the way it was dressed was divine. I went with the New York Strip, and my wife chose the Filet Mignon. The New York Strip surprised me, since I was used to Strips being tough, and extremely chewy. 5A5's NY Strip however, was AMAZING! It was so tender and juicy, by the time I had finished devouring it, I was hungry for more... just the way a proper steak house/lounge should be. My wife isn't a Filet fan either, but couldn't stop talking about how awesome her filet was. She had described it as tender, juicy, flavorful... and not at all dry in any way. We were both surprised that they didn't have to resort to using a strip of bacon to keep the filet moist. In addition to all of that, the waitress was exceptionally helpful, and made sure we were well taken care of.\n\nI'd recommend 5A5 to everyone... even vegetarians, vegans, and fruitarians :)\n\nFood: Spectacular.

I make all my friends go as well and everybody I've taken there has LOVED IT.  Bone in rib-eye is so tasty, lobster tempura is delightful, and the shooters are so sooo good. The wine list is great!

The drinks are damn strong (granted, I am pretty weaksauce) and the music is good too; props to the DJs! Other points are that the crowd is 95% asian mid 20 to 30 year olds.

Everyone chills in the small area/dancefloor by the bar. This area is simply too small for dancing AND standing around conversing. I wish more people would move towards the huge sitting area in the middle of the lounge and chat there to leave room for others who are actually trying to move around. If there were a bar on the other side of the lounge or in the middle of the seating area, people would probably be more willing to walk around.

The restaurant turns into a lounge/bar with music after hours on Fridays and Saturdays.  He approached me here two years ago and I basically told him to drop dead.  Here we are having his 31st birthday dinner! Oh how strange are the rules of attraction, right?\n\nAnyway, on to the review...\n\n5A5 Steakhouse is an excellent place for a special occasion dinner.  It's got a very modern and vibrant feel and attracts the early 30's and 40's and established crowed.  I wouldn't say it wasn't a child friendly establishment but it's certainly not the family restaurant...\nThe menu will make you want to try EVERYTHING!  We had a simple dinner though; 4 blue moons and a champagne drink that he ordered for me... ugh, brain fart! But it was delicious.  We split the iceberg salad; cute that they split it for us.  They brought out bread and butter; the bacon cheese bread was quite the favorite at our table (he LOVES bacon). He of course ordered the dry aged t bone steak; 22oz. of pure yummy goodness. BUT please consume the fried bone marrow in portion with caution!  It's quite rich in flavor.   While I ordered the 6oz. filet mignon (medium plus) which was amazing and was just the right size.  We had the mashed potatoes that were excellent!  After dinner they brought out a complimentary birthday dessert for him which was quite the piece of artwork along with another complimentary deep fried cheesecake dessert.  Our server, Dave was quite the host.  \n\nThe only thing that I flagged was the fact that he was starving and the steak took about 30 minutes.  In short, don't come starving! Then again, it's an upscale steakhouse so we should've known it would take a bit longer than the usual.  \n\nIt was an overall very pleasant evening.  5A5 was a great selection for his 31st birthday dinner location. I will be back for our anniversary or something.  I mean, I did tell him to drop dead here, right?", "author": "Patricia G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-10", "description": "The atmosphere is nice like a lounge setting.  It makes for a more casual feel, avoiding the traditional \"stuffy\" expensive steakhouse experience.  The bar has a nice feel to it, although, the drinks seemed rather small.  I had a couple of Martini's and the glass look really small.  I am used to a nice large martini glass when I go to a nice restaurant like this.\n\nOverall the food was good.  The only think that blew me away were the shooters -- highly recommend these.  \n\nThe Caesar Salad was nothing to brag about -- the usual SF type caesar salad you are used to.  I really don't understand why all the restaurants around SF have a \"creamy/mayonnaise\" based caesar dressing.  It is just supposed to be olive oil, anchovies, egg yolk, garlic, dried mustard, etc.\n\nAnyway, on to the steak.  So, I never understood restaurants calling themselves \"Steak\" restaurants when they don't offer up the traditional steak fare.  Every steak there is covered with a steak reduction sauce.  When you pay for a nice cut of Rib Eye at $45, the last thing that should be on it is a sauce.  This masks the flavor of the meat.  Good Prime Cut meats should be cooked with salt and pepper, period.  Then offer sauces on the side as options.\n\nWe had macaroni and cheese, mushrooms, and corn as our sides.  I do recommend the mac and cheese, the other ones weren't really rememberable. \n\nNow, onto the dessert.  So, I have never been to an upscale restaurant whom did not have cappuccinos or espresso.  A5 only has regular coffee.  So, after a big steak dinner and getting ready for dessert, sucking down their coffee, which tasted like Farmer Bros., finished up my experience on a bad note.\n\nI had the flour-less chocolate cake which tasted like it came out of a freezer.\n\nSo in summary, if you are not particular with your food when you probably spend about $75/person, then you'll enjoy it.  Probably a good spot to take a first date to since it is a relaxing environment.\n\nBut, for me, I have certain expectations for restaurants who call them selves \"Steak Houses\" or claim to be experts in steak.  If you too have these expectations, you'll be disappointed.  Be prepared to have your steak drenched in sauce and can't even have a nice espresso to break down that heavy sauce taste in your mouth.", "author": "Robert F."}

My brother, a friend, and I decided to come here on a whim and we made a reservation on OpenTable on Good Friday at 6:30pm and was seated right away once we all checked in.  The service was really good from the beginning to end.  Our glasses were always full and our server was always checking up on us to see how things were and if everything was cooked correctly.  The best thing our server did was suggest we order all of our food up front and that he would course it out based on our progress and he did a really good job at having plates arrive in time.\n\nFor starters, we had the \"Kobe\" sashimi.  Note that the Kobe is in quotes as it is not real Kobe beef, it is American Kobe.  We verified that with the server and he also joked about the quotes being used to signify that it is not authentic Japanese Kobe.  We decided to try it anyway and were not disappointed.  The American Kobe was not as fatty but it was very flavorful, creamy, and released a lot of flavor as you chewed it.\n\nNow, on to the main course...  I ordered the 4oz Wagyu rib cap with a side of 15oz  of prime rib, hey, I'm a big eater and 4oz would not be enough.  On the rib cap, I asked our server if he would have the kitchen top it with the garlic puree that normally comes with the rib-eye and he was very accommodating of the request.  Yes, the 4oz of Wagyu was $76 but well worth it.  Everything was ordered medium rare and with the rib cap, it's tricky, since the outer layers cook more, it starts out medium well but as you move to the center and get medium rare meat, any signs of disappointment instantly go away.  The meat was very creamy and tasty with wonderful beef fat spilling all over your tongue as you bite into and chew it.  Oh yeah, the prime rib was good too, it was cooked to the medium rare specifications as suggested by our server.  However, they cut the prime rib into three slices but I would have preferred one thick slice.  My brother also had prime rib and he was also satisfied with how it was cooked and presented.\n\nThe other item ordered by our friend was the special - 9oz bone-in filet mignon ($31).  The filet looked excellent as well and was also cooked a perfect medium rare.  Also, it looked like it was 10 or 11oz versus the 9oz we were told which is a good thing.  As for sides, we had the truffle fries with sriracha ailoli and the potatoes au gratin.  Both were great but the truffle fries kick ass!!  Toward the bottom of the truffle fries, you definitely get more truffle oil and the taste becomes stronger as you finish up the fries, yummy!\n\nOverall, this place beat my expectations.  I thought it would be one of those places that tries to offer Wagyu beef to make the place seem upscale while justifying higher prices but I was wrong.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends and will come back soon.  Enjoy!", "author": "Paul C."}

We walked here from our Union Square hotel because it was a mile away in the Financial District. On the weekends, the Financial District is a ghost town so it's a bit creepy walking through there at twilight because you don't see a lot of people around and everything is closed. \n    We arrived early for our early evening reservation and were seated immediately. Once you walk in, you get the feel that the place is a bit on the hipster side. It's got a modern feel with warm tones, white low banquettes, and that amazing overhead light array. But the staff is very welcoming and sat us at a nice intimate table. Our server, Robert, came over to make sure we were comfortable,  made sure we had water before taking our drinks order and giving us the low down on the menu. He told us that we order just the meat but sides are extra and our best bet would be to order an app and a side to share with our main. They also serve wagyu beef (which is like Kobe beef) which is by the ounce in price (starting at $9 an ounce). \n    But I had the special which was a 9 ounce bone in fliet mignon which my husband had a 4 ounce filet. For starters, we had the truffled fries and the seared fois gras. Our sides were the truffled mac and cheese and the haricot vert with goat cheese and pancetta. \n    The truffled fries come with a Rooster sauce mayo which is subtle and gives a nice little heat. They are thick cut fries, hot, lightly salted in a basket. The fois gras comes with a ricotta cannoli and poached pears. We liked the truffled fries a lot which I used later to eat the cheese sauce from the mac and cheese. The seared fois gras was creamy good but the pears were too sweet to compliment the fois gras correctly. I get where the chef was going with pairing the fois gras with the pears and the cannoli but it didn't quite work for us.\n    Our mains were terrific. The filet my husband had was plump and well seasoned but he felt the sauce overwhelmed the flavour of the beef. My filet mignon had a tarragon bearnaise sauce which gave it a fresh grassy sweetness. They had a good crust and maintained the plump medium rare consistency.\n    The truffled mac and cheese was stupendous. I mean, crazy good addictive. Like I said earlier, I used the fries to scrape up the cheese after we finished off the pasta. The haricot vert were tender crisp and the goat cheese with the sharp saltiness of the chunky pancetta was good. \n    For dessert, my hubs opted for the ice wine while I got the 7 degrees of chocolate which had milk chocolate ball of mousse, dark chocolate ball of mousse with 'chocolate glass' and a rubble of flourless chocolate cake, a green tea white chocolate mousse plus a dome of chocolate covered in dark chocolate shell. The milk chocolate was nice but what was a surprise was the dark chocolate mousse which was like fois gras. There was something about it that was like the consistency and there was a ghost of fois gras flavour about it. It was much better tasting than I am making it sound. \n    The staff kindly also gave me a plate with a peanut butter and chocolate mousse cake that was super tasty with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate. \n     Now, I had a couple of mixed drinks (The Prohibition Sunrise is the bomb) which made me a bit tipsy so finding the bathroom was sobering. The stairs down to the unisex bathroom is over behind the bar. You go down the stairs to the bathroom which is on the left (there are stalls against the wall and in the middle is a trough) while a private dining area is on the right. The sink has faucets that are recessed and the levers to turn it on are hidden underneath. You sort of have to toggle with it a bit before they turn on. \n    I would definitely say that I would come back here again. It's a great place for a date or business meal. It's quite pricey ($250 for two including drinks and dessert plus tip) so this is a definite special occasion place.", "author": "Kim S."}

DH and I went for a special dinner to the much-hyped 5A5 STEAK Lounge. I emphasize \"steak\" for reasons that will soon become apparent. The space has a lounge-like, \"underground\" feel, as the name implies. The service was spot-on. Seated before our reservation, waitress cheery and helpful. Began with cocktails- one with bourbon, one with Dewars (names escape me). Both delicious. I applaud the bacon and cheese bread. Rich, smoky and soft. The bourbon cocktail was well-balanced and not too sweet, the Dewars cocktail was sweet but not overly so. Then began with smoked salmon pastrami ( cubes of smoked salmon with a peppery coating served with creme fraiche and rye toast. Great combo of smoky and peppery, highly recommend). Also began with truffled fries. Portion was ENORMOUS. Deep, earthy truffle flavor was abundant. Natural cut as well. Now we were very excited for the main event.... however....\nwe lingered over wine for quite some time (not timing, but estimate perhaps 15 - 20 mins after completion of salmon and abandonment of the fries due to their richness and quantity). Finally, my 6 oz fillet and DH's prime rib arrived. The fillet was drowning in sauce which I rarely look favorably upon, since I like to taste the meat. I sliced into it and found that my \"medium rare\" fillet was very, very cold and sinewy inside. Even the edges were cool. DH got the saddest portion of prime rib ever. Two measly slices, no wider than a 1/4 inch, 1/2 of which was a grey colored layer of fat and the rest of which was cool to the touch and chewy. At over $25/entree with no sides included totally uncool. The side of hoisin sauce marinated brussel sprouts were the hi-light. Phenomenally sweet and sour. \n\nNow, I will agree that we weren't being proactive this particular evening and neither of us sent our steaks back. We should have, we could have, but nevertheless, a steakhouse can and should do better than this. One mis-fired piece of meat... ok, get it. Two? No dice, sugar pie. Go for apps, cocktails and veggies. Skip the steak.", "author": "Jenni D."}

The ambiance is POSH & GORGEOUS-- definitely a place to impress the ladies. Very modern decor, the white leather turned  me on. Michael, our server, was a sweety. \n\nStarted off with the cocktail shrimp, very nice, light, and fresh with a little seaweed salad garnish to compliment our drinks (I think I got the Orange Fizz ma bobber and the Guy got the Raspberry Lemon ma bobber... pretty good mixes).\n\nThen onto the Austrailian F1 Kobe NY with a side of truffle fries and mushrooms. I like my beef BLOODY so I ordered it med rare (should of said RARE though!). The fries came with this creamy siracha aioli and I wanted to eat it all.....there were at least three different types of mushrooms, all succulent, lightly soaked with sherry YUM.... the steak was pretty yum given that I am usually not a big red meat eater. Moist, soft, juicy. I am one with my carnivore side. \n\nMy Guy thought the steak was de-Lish but my personal preference was his Seabass - TO DIE FOR! I think it was seared with brown sugar / maple ness because the outside was lightly crispy and sweet and extremely moist and plump on the inside. It was decorated with little chunks of ham and green peas. His side dish was the Mac & Cheese (which Michael recommended) and that is some serious gourmet comfort food for the soul. \n\nSeveral dishes later.........STUFFED. Sorry, no more room for desert.\n\nAlthough the menu seems quite eclectic, it actually compliments itself very well regardless of whatever combo you get. Next time I'll come back to try the A5! (with truffle fries, of course.)", "author": "Geneva X."}

Got seated and it took our waitress a while to take our orders. Of course appetizers first and we ordered some fries. 20 minutes later we saw the fries going to a different table. Waitress comes and said the chef got the orders mixed up and it will be right out. 30 minutes later our entree and fries came all together. \n\nI ordered the fillet Mignon and it was delicious. Too bad I was too full to finish the rest. I ordered a lychee martini and it was not that good. I've tasted way better ones before.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place a 3 star is because of the workers who pours water into our cups. Whoever they are need to realize they have horrible body odor. My friends and I did not enjoy eating our nice meal and smelling BO. What made it  worse was the air conditioning being on. The AC fanned the BO smell so it lingered for a few seconds. We had to hold our breath every time we saw them coming.\n\nAfter dinner we had a table there. Management was very nice  and reserved the table where all the action was. At least that's what he said. I don't remember his name but he was nice and talkative. We drank and danced the night away and the place was pretty packed. Mixed guys and gals. Only thing weird to me was the bathroom. Never been to a place where the bathroom is coed and it sucks the bathroom is downstairs. Why would they put the restroom downstairs when girls with high heels on might fall? No I did not fall but almost did. Luckily one  of the girls was holding my arms. \n\nOverall nice place just need the water guys to put on some deodorant.", "author": "Helen S."}

Most nice steakhouses can serve a good filet...you buy a quality cut of meat and get someone experienced to cook it and you have a delicious meal. What really set this one apart was the sauce. Ohh, the sauce. I got the 6 oz. filet, medium, with the demi glaze and cheese fondue sauce on top. My fiance, who doesn't really prefer that cut of meat, couldn't deny the deliciousness.\n\nWe also got the BLT scallops, lettuce wedge, haricot vert and mac and cheese. All of them were really tasty, but not mind-blowing. The mac and cheese was definitely as good as Epic makes. The sides are actually the only reason I'm not giving 5A5 5 stars.\n\nThe service was outstanding. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive and not at all pushy and the wine selection was perfect for us. Affordable but still good enough. And if you prefer to bring your own, the corkage fee is $20.\n\nWe ended up with a bill for $175 for the scallops, lettuce wedge, 2 glasses of wine, a martini, a filet, a ribeye, the mac, the haricot vert and the American pie dessert. I would consider that a steal! We will most certainly be back!", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

My wife brought me for my birthday and I was absolutely disappointed. The food was bad and mediocre at absolute best. Even the \"shrooms\" (mushrooms dish) was lackluster compared to just frying some Safeway mushrooms with butter. The t-bone was terrible and the fillet was just... Well not good. Service was like a dive bar and we recently had better at the Lagunitas brewery (seriously a beer brewery with panini's as the food special had better food service). Not to mention we witnessed a waiter open a bottle of wine then proceed to drop it, bottle and all, on a customer. It was embarrassing to even be close too. Overall just save the money. Maybe go to Alexander's which was stupid expensive but great in all regards. This place is not worth it... And if your wondering why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 it's because our waitress was sweet. She had no product knowledge or ability to properly explain a menu that contained $400 cuts of meat, but she came across as a sweet girl.", "author": "Thomi V."}

I must apologize that I didn't eat my crab legs to the satisfaction of the busboy. I'm terribly sorry I didn't measure up to 5A5's high standards. I can only hope to aspire to be better, to some day approach the level of importance of only the best clientele in the city. Given a day or two to digest my experience, and the overall pretentiousness of the wait staff, I'm going down to one star. This is further informed by the fact that I emailed them feedbak and they didn't respond. Great sauce for the steak, though at the price the cut of beef really wasn't quite that great.

I guess is is supposed to be a fireplace or something; I hope that they have something warmer for the freezing sf winters. \n\nThree shooters. ummm... Oyster water melon shooter; it was very flavorful. Hamachi avacado ginger shooter; this was my favorite one. Wagyu something shot....try again, shot!....and again.....shot!!! It wouldn't come out. haha. I had to use a fork to dig it out. The chef is awesome, but it is a bit dry. I recognized the rib eyesteak immediately because it looks exactly like the one I had over in Alexander's in SJ. It was good. If anyone watches the food channel then you should expect the top shef looking food, not the iron chef stuff. The items are made very very well....just not WOW!! type deal (haven't tried the whole menu, so there might be something that is wow).\n\nFood is extremely subjective so you would have to show up to see for yourself. The decor is excellent. If you are not into the hip-modern look, then this is not for you. \n\nThen to service...\nService depends on that one server, on one night and on their mood, so DO NOT wrap the restaurant as one. They should train their servers well, but some bi-polar waiters will slip by and piss off the table. I say this because all the 1 and 2 stars given are because of service and personnel issues.

The 6-piece sashimi was delicious, but I would have liked more.  The truffle fries were good, but I think the sriracha aioli dipping sauce stole the spotlight.  The sauce was different, but not overwhelming and worked well with the fries.  Caesar salad was whole leaf, which I like, but there was a ton of dressing - almost too much dressing.  Dessert was a strawberry shortcake, and while it wasn't anything special, it still wrapped up the meal rather nicely.  The restaurant was a bit noisy, but they were sufficiently accommodating.

We found free parking couple blocks away but the walk wasn't too bad. We had reservation but it took them about 5-10 minutes to set up the table for us. It was no problem because we sat at the bar and started the night off with some drinks. \n\n    We started the dinner of with a couple appetizer. The hamachi and A5 wagyu shots were AMAZING. I'm practically drooling as I'm recalling the taste. We ordered one shot per person but we should've made it two! Another impressive appetizer is the truffle fries. My friends could not stop raving about it. It was finger licking good thanks to the truffle oil..  I ordered the iceberg lettuce but it was nothing to rave about. I barely touched it. The bacon bits were super thick and the blue cheese were super thick and rich... a couple bites and I was already sick of my salad.. but the portion was huge.  We ordered filet mignon, buffalo filet, bone-in ribeye, and the dry aged bone-in file, world wide wagyu. I think the ribeye was the one that was HUGE. I had the dry aged bone-in file and I liked it. Although I thought that the wagyu is a little bit better, more tender. We had the sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and mash potatoes, and mac and cheese as sides. The mac and cheese was delicious. The desserts were also very good as well. The service was on point. They are constantly cleaning your table, and making that you're doing okay. The place turned in to a lounge after.

I've been to this place for evening events and actually wondered how the dining experience would be. Well, now I really wished I just stuck with drinks in the lounge area. \n\nThe food was not terrible, though it was not memorable either. Our server was fantastic. The guy was a walking 5A5 food encyclopedia. He did a wonderful job describing the dinner and specials. We ending up with hamachi and oyster shooters, truffle fries, clam chowder, tuna tartare, iceberg salad, dry age steak, buffalo fillet mignon, sides of chanterelle mushroom and their mashed potato.\n\n Oyster shooter was the highlight of the meal. Flavor was right on point with just enough citrus. Hamachi was overly doused with lime juice and it took away the taste of the actual hamachi. The tuna tartare suffered the same fate as the hamachi shooter in that it was overly flavored with lime juice. Truffle fries were tasty and my pal inhaled those. I did not get to try the chowder because he inhaled that too! Presentation of the chowder was the \"wow\" of the night as it came with a real sea shell that held ceviche and some sort of foam concoction. All it was missing was the Venus to create a masterpiece. Iceberg salad had a nice blue cheese dressing with bits of bacon that I didn't care for. Tried a bit of my friend's dry age steak covered in peppercorn. I'd give it 1 thumb up. My medium rare buffalo fillet mignon was well prepared. Another 1 thumb up. Side of mushroom gets 2 thumbs up! It was mushrooms, how can you mess that up?\n\nEnded our meal with their 7 degree chocolate and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. That was definitely something I could pass on. What irked me most was when we were ready to go, service started to lag and it took much longer than needed to get the bill. \n\nI will return for drinks, apps, people watching and pretty much just the evening scene.

Our waitress recommended the Hamachi Shooters and the crab salad to start. The salad came before the shooters, which I thought was strange. It was crab, avocado, spring leaves and what tasted like a gallon of lime juice. Crab and avocado are two of my favorite foods but because of the spicy lime juice/sauce it tasted horrible. Even with four people sharing this salad we barely finished it. \n\nThe waitress came by to ask how our shooters were and we had to tell her that we hadn't gotten them yet. They came a few minutes later and after shaking them up we threw them back...or tried to. There was WAY too much going on in those shots. It was more like a tiny bowl of fish and ponzu sauce, and unfortunately the fish didn't taste that fresh. After taking the shot I had to chew for about three minutes.\n\nWe were going to order the Sea Bass as one of our entrees but found out it is Chilean and going extinct so we passed on that and ordered the New York Strip Steak, asparagus and spinach. When our waitress had first come over to our table she described the asparagus as the \"healthy\" option and the mac and cheese as the \"unhealthy/random option\". I thought this was incredibly weird since Mac n Cheese is like the most popular side in SF restaurants right now. I also wasn't about to be like, \"yes, I'm a fatty and can I please get a big side of the unhealthy mac n cheese\".\n\nThe food was OK, but nothing was special. Everything is served on small plates to share. I did like the steak but the two sauces on the side were not good.\n\nWe also ordered two desserts that were both not great. They didn't have any chocolate options on the menu and again, with four people we didn't even finish the two desserts.\n\nUnless they start a happy hour with $1 oysters and cheap drinks I will not be back.

A few years back, I was in Tokyo for an invitational dinner at one of those Kobe steak and beer restaurants and quite frankly I cannot tell you to this day if the steaks were outstanding, perhaps it was the wine they kept passing to us on a looooong paddle. \n\n5A5, (a sous chef who worked at Alexander became the executive chef-as noted from Randy F, of Palo Alto), was an unforgettable experience. I had to go back 3 times to make sure I wasn't delusional. \nThe first and second visit, I had the shooters (a trio of hamachi, ahi and oyster), Lobster Tempura,Truffle Fries, the Green Tea Doughnuts, which tastes alot like Malasadas and the Chocolate Menage a Trois. For the steaks entree, the first visit, I stuck with the prix fixe dinner (shooter, bacon-cheese salad, filet mignon and the donut dessert $39.00), The second visit, I was invited by Yelpers Anna C. and her husband Matt! We had ordered almost the same, except for the salad (Cesar), shared the asparagus side and for the \"Steaks\", we had the American, Australian and the Wagu (rib eye). We made the mistake of eating the Wagu rib eye first, and the Australian and American took the back seat in flavor, tenderness and indescribable carnivore delight!\n       Yesterday's visit, I wanted to concentrate more on the Wago steak, so we ordered a simple fare of Lobster Tempura, Truffle Fries, Cesar salad (she had the bacon-cheese salad), the Wagu Rib Eye (I had the 8 oz and she had the 4 oz) and for dessert, we ended with sharing a panna cotta chocolate pie and the famous Green Tea Doughnuts.\n\nMy guest and I ultimately agreed that we can never go back to the steaks we had in the past.

I took a seat at the bar... but I should note that upon coming in, being the only brotha in sight, one of the wine connoisseurs looked at me up and down...either because he was a snob, or more than likely preferred good looking men with very muscular builds lol. Well, whatever. On to the food!\n\nAppetizer:\nI started of with the truffle fries (5 out of 5) and that alone will have me coming back for more, nuff said.  Then ordered an asparagus soup with clams (3 out of 5) which was good, but was missing something in flavor but can't quite put my finger on it, but still good.\n\nEntree: \nThe first entree I ordered was the 8 oz fillet wagyu (4 out of 5).  It was very good but one thing... I ordered medium rare, and gave it to me medium well.  Luckily though even the way it was cooked, it cut like butter and had that marble-melt-in-your-mouth flavor to it.  \nNext entree was the seabass (5 out of 5) that had artichokes and infused with trufles, which further made it pretty damn good.  BTW, I ordered the Mac & Cheese (5 out of 5) that had three cheeses and tasted of truffles, but couldn't finish because I was pretty much done.\n\nIn all, this is definitely one of the better steakhouses I have been in the city.  I went at around 5:45pm, a very yuppie crowd at first, but soon came more younger people (mid-late 20s), which had a more chill atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend this to somebody who doesn't seek a traditional steakhouse.", "author": "Darius R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-08", "description": "My friends and I just went to this place for my birthday. As big steak aficionados, we were really looking forward to trying a new place and hopefully finding a new mainstay in our rotation. Unfortunately, 5A5 didn't quite make the cut, particularly given the prices.\n\nWe didn't try the Wagyu steaks, but we did have the bone-in ribeye, the dry-aged bone-in NY, the dry-aged T-bone, and the prime rib. The prime rib was actually quite good (the rub has a bit more kick than the standard salt & pepper you get from other places). The steaks, however, were slathered with sauces and condiments that generally left us confused. A good steak, particularly aged steak, really only needs salt & pepper (and maybe butter and/or garlic). Sometimes you'll want something different like a peppercorn sauce or a lot of horseradish, but by and large the flavor of the steak should be what carries the day. For some reason, 5A5 feels compelled to cover their steaks with incredibly rich, flavorful sauces that completely overwhelm the flavor of the meat. If you're going to go that route, you may as well be using brisket, tri-tip, flank steak, or any of the other less expensive cuts. After a few quick bites, all of us immediately scraped off as much of the sauce as we could and tried to get a taste of how the steaks actually were on their own. The texture was fantastic, the cuts were large and well-marbled, and they were cooked perfectly (if you order medium rare, you will get medium rare). As for the taste, that was pretty much impossible to determine given you couldn't get rid of the strong sauce flavor regardless of what you tried.\n\nAnd before you write off this review as a bunch of steak snobbery - all of us have very different palates and are not at all against steak sauce (which is why we didn't just order them plain in the first place). I think we'll try coming here again and ordering steaks without any sauce, and in doing so will probably enjoy the main courses much, much more.\n\nAll that being said:\n\nThe Bites & Starters were all fantastic. I didn't have any Bites but my friends tried several of them, and they all loved them. We had the Wagyu sliders and those were wonderful (particularly if you enjoy steak tartare).\n\nThe Soup du Jour was wild mushroom, which we all had, and we all loved. Great flavor, and the texture was perfect. The only thing wrong with the soup is that there wasn't more of it.\n\nThe Sides were hit-or-miss. The \"shrooms\" were simple but actually a wonderful compliment given how rich the steaks were. The mashed potatoes were kind of meh overall but pretty much as-expected - Japanese curry over mashed potatoes. I will say that they were a bit runnier and flatter than expected for steakhouse mashed potatoes. Also, I'm guessing they don't use a lot of butter in the mix, as that would probably make the potatoes too rich when you include the curry. As a vegetable side we included the vert, which was overcooked and over-seasoned. Imagine tough, salty string beans, and that's pretty much what we got.\n\nOh, and before I forget, for the alcoholics: the Electric Sidecar and the Bourbon Baked Apple were both great. The latter seems to really sneak up on you, so be warned.\n\nOverall I'd say that this is a pretty good restaurant that still seems to be trying to find its way. I really hope they re-evaluate the menu, particularly the steaks, and try to figure out a better balance to all of the flavors going every which way. If I were to go again, I'd focus more on the Bites and the Starters, include a bowl of soup, and then have a plain steak with some marble potatoes on the side as the main course.\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that the service was impeccable!", "author": "Jeremy T."}

It was cooked to perfection, so tender and delectable! \n\nAfter dinner hours, the restaurant turns into a lounge/night club. We wanted to stick around, but the music that they played on that particular night was not to our liking and the crowd didn't seem too diverse. Other than that, 5A5 Steak Lounge offers a really upscale and eye-pleasing ambiance and mouth-watering, tasty, yummy food!", "author": "Ro Y."}

He chooses this place.\n\nI make a reservation for 5:30, it's a World Series night, so I figure it won't be that busy.  Whoa!  Understatement of the Year!  We walk in, there's 2-3 tables seated.  I say to the hostess,  \"Turnaway crowd tonight, huh?\"  I get a look....apparently my efforts at humor are not appreciated.\n\nWe get seated....It's cold in here!  If you bring a date, tell her to forget the strapless gown bit unless she's a bit on the, how should I say it, \"chunky\" side.  \n\nI've read the Yelp reviews, so I pretty much know what to get that's good, so we go for the lobster something-or-other appetizer, truffle fries, mac and chz and a meat dish.  OK, here's what I think.\n\nLobster something-or-other.  Lobster fried with a dipping sauce. 1 star.\nTruffle fries.  Plain ol' fries with a dipping sauce.  1 star\nMac and chz.  Why the raves, folks?  This is macaroni with a cream sauce and a chz topping.  Bland, bland, bland!  1/2 star...I'm sorry, but I make Mac and chz waaaay better than this!\n\nOh yeah, \"Bacon bread\" comes with the appetizers.  French bread that tastes as if you've put a little bacon grease on it.  Frankly, I like just plain old French bread, but whatever floats your boat.\n\nI order the bone-in T-bone.  One big hunka meat!  No complaints about this....cooked as ordered (medium-rare) tender and flavorful.  Too bad the rest of the sides didn't measure up to the meat!\n\nDessert was a chocolate wafer bar with a dab of topping.  Just about right to offset a greasy meal.  Coffee was coffee.\n\nThe bill arrives....$195.  I grab my phone to calculate the 20% tip (I flunked long division in school...) and my friend says, \"20%?  Just give him 11 20's and you're done!\"  He's a business man, so I say \"OK, fine.\")  I mean, what do I know?\n\nWe dawdle a bit and then get up to leave.  You know how it is in most restaurants....?  You go to leave and the hostess and the waitstaff catch you on the way out and say something along the lines of, \"Thanks!  C'mon back!\"?  Only I notice it's silence when we leave.  I figure they either don't do that here or they're doing something else.  Oh well....\n\nI get home and I'm lying in bed reviewing the evening, when suddenly I say, \"Wait a minute!!  20% of $100 is $20, so then.....Oh rats!!\"\n\nSo if anyone from 5A5 is reading this, and remembers the two guys who they served on 10/30, my sincere apologies!  I don't stiff waitstaff for good service!  It was an accident, so if I return at some point, please don't serve me the, \"Special sauce\" with my meal!  It was a miscalculation! I'll make it up to you.....promise!!", "author": "Dan S."}

I would have paid the full price for that meal, no problem! I would also pop in for their happy hour deals any time, but check the menu as they change from day-to-day. Wednesday night was $1 oyster night, though!\n\nOur server was very kind and informative, as was rest of the staff. The food was fantastic:\n\n- Bacon Bread! I thought that this might be an overkill item, but it was just perfectly, pleasantly salty and smokey.\n- Lobster tempura - while I don't think that the actual frying of the lobster did anything to imrpove the taste of lobster, 5A5's dipping sauce was a wonderful tangy and sweet compliment.\n- Iceberg wedge salad - a classic flavor combination of bleu cheese, bacon, and tomato, updated with a spicy dose of watercress. Fantastic.\n- Buffalo filet - my girlfriend was really happy with her healthy, tasty buffalo dish.\n- Bone-in Ribeye. This 25 ounce behemoth would have tipped over \nFred Flintstone's car without a doubt. Cooked and seasoned to perfection, and packed up half of it to enjoy at home the next day! The only thing I would have suggested is about HALF the amount of balsamic sauce. It's great, but isn't needed so much.\n- Sides - The truffle mac-n-cheese was delicious and devoured. Unfortunately, we had to send back the brussel sprouts and ordered haricots vert as a replacement, which were much better. This is a hard town to serve underwhelming brussel sprouts in, but they took them off the bill, which I wasn't expecting.\n\nLastly, the host and server took notice that we were celebrating a special occasion and were nice enough to arrange for a complementary desert. This is the kind of generosity and thoughtfulness that will make me a return customer. That, and the fact that my steak was unreal.

And given what it is -- $16 an ounce is believe it or not a bargain.   \n\nI would go here purely for the steak.  But the Hamachi shooters were fantastic as well.

I'm not really willing to fork over hundreds for A5 Wagyu, so the australian kobe is a good alternative. The buffalo filet really surprised me as it was more tender than beef! My fave was the ribeye. Be sure to share the 25oz bone-in ribeye because that's a lot of meat! What makes it great is the sauce. The barbecue demi glaze is the best sauce I've had with steak.  I think it's lame that the steak is not served with sides. The sides portions are huge, so we ordered the mac & cheese and portobello to share amongst 3 people.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-20", "description": "Wow! The meal that my husband and I had at 5A5 Steak Lounge was amazing! Executive Chef, Allen Chen, has accomplished one of the most innovative and delicious menu in a city that boasts some of the most top rated restaurants. (Many of which we have eaten in.......Gary Danko, Boulevard Restaurant, and Fleur de Lys to name a few.) \n\nWe started our meal with the Smoked Salmon Pastrami. Now, I know what you are thinking. This sounds so odd that it can either go very wrong, or be utterly mouth wateringly delicious! It was mouth wateringly delicious! The sushi grade salmon was dusted in a pastrami seasoning rub that suprisingly flavored the salmon perfectly. Underneath, was a dill creme fraiche. This was accompanied by small slices of rye bread and sauerkraut. We both opted for the same entree, a filte mignon with a boursin cheese foundue demi glaze. They were cooked perfectly. Nothing is more dissapointing in a restaurant that specializes in steak, than to have your steak over or under cooked. On the contrary! We both asked for a medium rare, and that is exactly what we were given.  (Both of these entrees were on the dine about town menu this year.) We then opted for the dessert that was included with this menu, which I would have to say is the only dissappointment  that I had. My husband had the Truffle Tort Dark Chocolate Mousse, and I had the Strawberry Cake with Strawberry Salsa. I found my cake to be a bit on the dry side. However, I must not forget to mention how moist and delicious the bacon bread ,that is brought out to your table when you arrive, is! In addition, the wine and beer list was quite unique and extensive as well. For the real wine connoisseurs, they do have a an extensive reserve list. I was thrilled to see that included in their regular wine list, by the glasss, was a Nickel & Nickel Chardonnay. \n\nI would definitely go back, and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to enjoy an innovative steak house for a special occassion.", "author": "Suzanne T."}

I know it's a lounge, but I'm not a fan of pulling out my ID to have dinner....maybe ID people going into the bar section instead? Also, there seemed ot be a lot of security inside, and I kind of felt like I was being watched while eating.....creepy....\nAnyways, the hostess was very friendly and offered to take my coat, yay for coat check! we were seated right next to the entrance to the kitchen, which was fine, but I'd definitely ask to not be sat there again (too much foot traffic). The kitchen is visible through decorative paneling, which I liked- it's always nice to see where your food is being prepared. \nOur waitress was not the friendliest person in the world, but she was decent. The music was a bit too loud, because she couldn't hear our food orders and had to repeat them back to make sure she heard the right thing....definitely need to have a volume adjustment. \nWe ordered the Hamachi shooters, and yes, they were delicious....I could easily see myself ordering 5....the lamb pops were overcooked in my opinion, and flavorless (definite room for improvement)...the truffle fries smelled divine....if only I could have tasted them....sigh.....40 days until carbs are back in my diet...but the fact that you could get extra truffle oil on them....AMAZING!!! The Caesar salad was overdressed in my opinion, and my date didn't appreciate having to cut his own lettuce....I like it though...just minus some dressing. I ordered the NY steak, which I thought was delicious, and at $15, I will definitely be back for it. Date had the Kobe beef one $29, and said it was really good....and he is pretty snobby about his steak....so... \nMy complaints would be the lack of bread and butter? What restaurant that serves steak doesn't serve bread?...not that I could have eaten it, but when Lent is over, they better have bread. The lack of a cocktail menu, I'm sure they will get one together by the time of the grand opening, but come on...one little specialty cocktail would have been nice. The dessert menu had 3 desserts, none of which were very appealing. \nI really see A5 being a great restaurant, they just need to work out a few kinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-05", "description": "From the desk of Le' Puod'...\n\nRestaurant: A5 Steak Lounge\nWednesday, March 4, 2009\n\nNote: The restaurant is only in its \"soft-opening\" phase so many additions to decor and menu are still to come and to be finalized for the Grand Opening at the end of March.\n\n9:00 P.M.\nYou walk in and is instantly greeted by the hostess, very nice.\nThe concept A5 Steakhouse is original and attractive. The decor is modern and sheik. The vibe is intimate but fused with anticipation of excitement as you hear the soft bass of the music in the background.\n\nWe sit down and is greeted by who we believe is the owner/manager of A5, Steve. Steve explained each of the dishes on the menu and kindly suggest some recommendations and his favorites for us to consider.\n\nThe Dishes:\nHamachi Shooter -\nA5's most popular starter was the Hamachi Shooter. The presentation was clever and original with the dish served in a shot glass. As suggested in the name of the dish, the meal was taken as a shot. This Asian-fusion style cerviche is an absolute must order. The roe and sesame seed added a nice crunch to the dish while the ponzu sauce complimented the fish with the salty and citricy taste.  \n\nOne suggestion I would make to the restaurant is to be aware of any chips in the shot glass before serving to the patrons.\n\nLobster Bisque -\nCompliments of the chef, the bisque, soon to be added to the menu, looked pleasing served in another style of shot glass. The look was definitely original. This dish is to be sipped. \n\nSpinach & Truffle Fries -\nThe Truffle Fries were what we expected...delicious. The truffle oil added a nice touch to the flavoring of the potatoes. You can also request for additional truffle oil if you'd like. I thought it was fine as is but my bf loved the extra truffle. \n\nThe Spinach was good; however, it lacked presentation. I suggest maybe adding a few shreds of carrots or something on top or side to add color to the dish.\n\nSeabass -\nThis was our favorite dish of the night. \nThe presentation was nice and bold with the fish served in the plate by itself, and the sauce on the side. The ginger-soy sauce may be drizzled entirely over the fish or used for dipping; we recommend drizzling it on. \nThe seabass was cooked to perfection -- it was moist and the nice subtle crust on top added a great texture to the fish. The ginger-soy sauce finished the final touchings to the overall dish. A suggestion to the restaurant - increasing slightly the serving size.\n\nSteak -\nAs much as we wanted to love the kobe steak (because it is a steak restaurant), this dish was a bit disappointing. The presentation could be better and could follow the same bold statement like the Seabass. We ordered medium cooked but it was slightly more cooked. Additionally, perhaps slightly thicker slices per serving.\n\nDessert - \nAs with their starters and main course menus, I believe A5 is still working adding more items to their dessert menu. Currently, the menu lists three chocolate type desserts -- Chocolate Banana Mouse, Currant with White Chocolate Mouse and Chocolate Marbled Cheesecake. \nA suggestion for the restaurant - Perhaps adding a lighter type dessert like a fruit tart, sorbe/sherbert for those who are not chocolate lovers. \n\nChocolate Marble Cheesecake -\nTo our surprise, this was also our favorite of the night and it was defintiely a nice way to end our meal, night and experience at A5. With any typical cheesecake, you automatically associate \"heavy\" dessert. We were looking for something lighter but since that wasn't an option, we went with the cheesecake as it was highly recommended the waiter. \nThis was not your typical (heavy tasting) cheesecake; rather, it was airy and light, just what we wanted. The presentation was of a cute french pastry dessert topped with blackberry and abstract chocolate piece. The chocolate surprised us with a hint of mint taste that leaves your breath feeling refreshed, complimenting the cheesecake. \n\nAdditional Notes/Suggestions:\nAlong with the suggestions listed for the dishes above, it would be a signature move for the restaurant to include a cocktail menu. This will add more personal touch from the restaurant even if they only create one signature A5 drink.\n\n\nA5 Steak Lounge is definitely the next new spot in San Francisco. \nI cannot wait to see all the final touches and additions at the Grand Opening.", "author": "Julie M."}

(Nice that two of the girls I came with know the host!) Completely famished after a few happy hour cocktails at a previous venue, we order the following (mind you, all for a table of 5 girls): \n* Edamame - can't go wrong with edamame. Slight garlic flavor was a nice touch, more dynamic than just plain boiled. \n* Truffle fries with sriracha aioli (3 orders) - so simple, yet so addicting. The truffle oil was perfect, not overwhelming and the sriracha added a nice lil spicy kick to them. All three orders were done! \n* Hamachi shooters - fresh lil pieces of hamachi and avocado heaven! Not a seafood lover, but these are perfect bite-sized pieces of fresh and well cut. \n*Chicken yakitori - probably my least favorite of the entire meal, but having said that, the pieces of chicken were tender and sauce tasty enough. \n*\"Kobe\" sliders - LOVE kobe beef and I LOVE sliders. Perfect sized patties for the bun. Not too many ingredients crowding the patty, makes for a savory juicy meaty treat! \n* Mac n' cheese - Anywhere I can order mac n' cheese, I will. Very well done--baked to perfection, gooey, cheesy goodness! Could have had the entire dish to myself! \n\nLove the swanky, yet unpretentious decor. Overall, inviting and sexy ambiance.

I decided to take some friends and family from out of town to 5A5 last Friday and this place did not disappoint.The ambiance is upscale and trendy and this restaurant also has a very decent sized bar. If there is any wait to be seated at the table then the bar is the place to hangout. \n\"Complement's to the chef\" were the lobster tempura and the Hamachi shooters (they were so good we ordered another round).  I also ordered the Mizuna Salad because I need some veggies in my life.  For dinner I had a Bone-in Ribeye steak with brandy peppercorn sauce and shiitake mushrooms . The steak was cooked to my liking and the flavor was full and the steak just melted in my mouth (pause).  One of the best steaks i've ever had.  Service was timely and the waiter was very attentive and checked on us often. The bill wasn't cheap but worth every penny.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and am planning to go there again very soon.", "author": "gilbert w."}

We had a couple shooters -- hamachi and poke, and it was a great way to start off the evening.  I had a Derby to sip on and apparently it was the strongest cocktail on the menu.  It matched well with all of the other appetizers we ordered.  For small bites, we had the sashimi and it was very fresh.  Each had its own drizzle of sauce that complemented each fish.  We also had the baked scallops wrapped in proscuitto.\n\nBut the stars of the day was our entree and sides.  We shared the Worldwide Wagyu Sampler that consisted of three types of steak:  The US certified Angus Beef, the Australian \"Kobe\", and the 100% Wagyu beef imported from Japan.  Each steak had its own texture and seasoning that gave it its own unique flavors.  We both agreed that the Japanese Wagyu was our favorite.  I've never imagined that meat can actually melt in your mouth.  It was that wonderful!\n\nWe had the mac and cheese and it was to die for.  I love mac and cheese and by far, this has to be one of the most unique and tasty mac and cheese I've ever ate.  It was made in white truffle oil and different types of cheeses which was highlighted gruyere cheese.  I was so tempted in ordering another one to go.  It was that good!!!\n\nFor desserts, we had the Vietnamese coffee cake and ice cream and the everso delightful Matcha Oolong Green Tea Donuts with ice cream.  It was definitely a great way to end our culinary experience.\n\nI'm definitely coming back especially during happy hour where the shooters are 2 for $5.", "author": "Nate N."}

Okay, that's an exaggeration.  But before you dissect the bold statement I just made, you have to go try the steaks here.  Fortunately, in the rare occasion that a hard-a$$, hardcore, anal retentive friend comes in handy (yes, I know those are all synonyms), we ordered to try the different types of steaks in a very particular sequence.  So much so, he'd threaten to stick your fork... well, you get the idea.  We had the American dry-aged NY (which is rare, I hear even Morton's doesn't DA their meats anymore?), the Australian, and two types of Japanese wagyu, the ribeye and another cut.  I sample the American, and it was good -- well seasoned, tender, and juicy -- but nothing mind blowing.  Next came the Australian -- which was even moe tender and juicy, but again, nothing spectacular.  And then the Japanese cuts.... mind blowing is an understatement.  To say that they melt in your mouth is fair.  To proclaim that I'd entered bovine heaven is... weird... but more accurate.  And I entered that domain again and again... and again.... \"You gonna eat that piece?\"  \n\nOh yeah, the restaurant serves other stuff?!!?  To round out the meal, we started with the highly favored and written about hamachi shooters, which were outstanding (hint: shake the shot glass vigorously to ensure proper entry).  The lobster tempura skewers, albeit a little much--with half a tail each were expertly fried and seasoned.  The kobe sliders, ummm, slid wonderfully down my throat (have them split your order chedda and gueyere cheeses and try both!).  The beef carpaccio roll was a little different, but excellent nonetheless.  As most people have mentioned, the sides were a bit uninspired--the mac and cheese is something you can't really mess up?; the potato fingerling were good, but a little too oily; and the corn... well, I LOVE corn and have high expectations when it comes to it... grilled, sauteed, fried (they don't but should)... and the corn and edamame didn't cut it.  \n\nI loved the decor, which was exactly what I'd expected.  I know that for some people, it's love/hate.  But this is suppose to be an avante garde steak lounge that defies the traditional stodgy old school steakhouses.  And I think this place is THAT.

The last time we were here, we shared the 25oz Bone-in Rib Eye which was an excellent selection.  It takes 35-40 minutes to prepare since they grill it once, let it sit, then grill it again because this makes the steak come out better.  This time we had a party of 6 and one friend was able to take down the 25oz Rib Eye on his own.  It was quite impressive.  This time I ordered the 8oz NY strip and normally, I like to cook steak at home but this NY strip tasted great.  We had another friend order the Filet Mignon which he liked very much.  \n\n For sides we ordered the mashed potatoes sprinkled with chunks of candied bacon, the mushrooms, and the macaroni and cheese.  ( All sides were good and I highly recommend the mushrooms.)  One of our friends got the Tako Salad (octopus) and I am not one for octopus though this tasted great as well.  I also ordered Ichigo - a Japanese rice beer that was very refreshing since Wednesday night was the warmest night I had ever experienced in San Francisco.  The Shisito Pepper appetizer is also a good starter to order.  Service was excellent.  Felipe our server was very attentive and Eric the Manager on Duty cared enough to check in with our party to make sure that we were having a great dining experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-10", "description": "I like my steaks kind of traditional, not a lot of extra sauce or flavoring, e.g., Morton's or Fleming's style (yes I know they are chains, but they are successful for a reason...)  And I like a baked potato with tons of sour cream and butter.  And maybe some kind of green something as a side.  5A5 is definitely not a traditional steakhouse.  It's a fun, mod, hip place to be.  The steaks, while good (can't really complain about a perfectly cooked bone-in filet or bone-in NY), come with a bit too much extra sauce and stuff for my liking.  The starter iceberg wedge was decent, nothing too crazy or fancy about it.  Pancetta bits were good.  The sides were also good, but again, no baked potato option.  We got the mashed potatoes, which were so ridiculously creamy I could feel my arteries blocking up...  it was topped with huge chunks of bacon, the kind that looks like bits of ham with tons of layers of fat.  Also had the mushroom side, which was like 8 different kinds of Japanese mushrooms.  Light dressing/saute sauce.  They were fine.  (Btw, re-heating the almost entirely leftover plate of mashed potatoes at home the next morning... the amount of oil and butter that oozed out from the bacon and the potatoes was so out of control we had to toss it.)\n\nDessert was pretty good.  The sticky toffee bread pudding didn't really live up to its billing by our waitress as \"the best bread pudding I have ever had\" but perhaps we're spoiled here in SF.  The matcha green tea donuts were really fun, with raspberry compote and oolong ice cream.  And the two final citrus macaroons at the end, with the writing \"Congratulations\" on the plate in chocolate (for our anniversary), was a nice touch, as was the single candle on the side of the bread pudding plate.\n\nOverall, a very fun time.  Crowd was mixed for a 5:30 Friday night reservation.  Bar area was getting hopping, some cool looking people there.  A couple of families with kids under 10 were there.  A four top of two couples in their 70's or 80's came and sat near us (a full *hour* after we sat down.... man we love eating early these days!).  A lone Asian man who ordered a pot of hot water, a steak, and a couple sides, ate his meal in the blink of an eye and left.  A group of five rough looking types (not a single one wearing a button down shirt) came in and the smell of pot wafted right in with them.  They probably had an *amazing* meal!!!  And of course, the caucasian 50 year old male with a 20 something asian girl dressed up in a red trench coat and a super short low cut black cocktail dress with louboutins was a nice touch as well.  So, a pretty varied crowd.\n\nAnd the dimly lit communal bathroom, with one row of single bathrooms on the left and two unisex larger handicapped bathrooms with their own sinks on the right?  A little too clubby for me, but since it was empty and I didn't have to stare at any greasy dude while washing my hands in the trough, twas fine.\n\nFun time though.  Decent steaks.  (Oh, and obviously, you can pay a TON more for the A5 top grade stuff, which is listed on a price per ounce basis, and also listed as available in the certain oz portions...  Fun multiplication times, though if you can afford a $400 steak sampler, you certainly shouldn't need to be calculating prices...)", "author": "Isabel M."}

After discovering the restaurant was still in the \"soft opening\" phase, I was pretty anxious to check out the place. \n\nSince I was a little early for our reservations, I stopped by the bar for a glass of Pinot Noir. The bartenders were quick to attend to my needs which is always a great way to start the evening. The glass was priced average at $9 per glass. \n\nAfter being seated, we were quickly greeted by our servers. We ended up ordering the: \n\n-Hamachi Shooters (Excellent) \n-Caesar Salad (The anchovies are always a nice touch) \n-Sea Bass (Pretty good; was cooked about right but somewhat bland. The dipping sauce was just average to me since it was similar to a soy ponzu) \n-Regular NY Steak (Our first serving was cold, not acceptable; the kitchen needs to work on the consistency of the food. The second try was better but the sauce was different than the first dish. The steak was cooked to my liking and the beef was very tender. I'm still torn about my beef coming pre-sliced). \n-Mac n Cheese [side] was just OK to me. (The Gruyere cheese was not bold enough in flavor but the baked bread crumbs gave the dish a very nice texture) \n-Mixed Mushrooms [GOOD] (I Really enjoyed this side. Nice combination of mushrooms and they're seasoned very well.) \n-Truffle Fries (the crispiness was perfect. The hint of truffle oil and Parmesan is a great touch to the fries. A little more salt might have enhanced this a bit.) \n-Garlic Spinach (This was just meh. It's your average spinach dish with garlic and salt. I would suggest maybe a little pork fat in there. You can't go wrong with bacon, pancetta or prosciutto.) \n\nThe kitchen service tonight gets two stars. Our entrees were somehow lost and we waited 45 minutes for our steaks which were served cold the first time around.  I have to point out that the manager/owner noticed the mix-up and comped our meal. I have to commend the management for that kind gesture; bravo on the customer first ideal.\n\nI also need to point out that A5 has a selection of the highest quality beef available. Wagyu steak at $16/oz is the top quality beef they serve. Kobe beef is also on the menu. \n\nI will try this place again in hopes the kitchen problems are alleviated. Good luck A5...there is definitely high potential.  I'll have to save room for dessert next time.", "author": "Curt L."}

Definitely hip and happening for a dinner place and steakhouse. I've been here several times and I have the say, the new menu is DELICIOUS. I highly recommend 5A5 for the food, atmosphere, and price.\nI'm starting with the DESSERT because it was delicious and a must. My family has a HUGE sweet tooth and if anyone knows dessert it's my relatives. We ordered one of everything and passed them around. Great presentation and great infusion of Asian tastes. The green tea donuts are good, but I loved the banana cream dessert - tasty, light & creamy, and it had a  mix of chocolate chips in it for texture. The creme brulee (a taste of 3 flavors) was awesome. The chocolate cake was more of a mousse, but very good and rich. Definitely save room for dessert!\n\nFor appetizers, we had the macaroni and cheese, mushrooms, corn, edamame, truffle fries, and hamachi and tuna shooters.\nEverything was soooo good! For the mushrooms they used a variety of Japanese mushrooms in the dish and I LOVE mushrooms. For the corn, it didn't look like anything special, but it turned out to be really sweet and had a refreshing taste that we couldn't decipher but loved. The hamachi and tuna shooters didn't dissapoint, and who doesn't love macaroni and cheese! The edamame was ok, prepared differently than most places. They weren't just steamed, but prepared in an Asian sauce.\n\nFor the main course, we tried out the special - which had 3 types of steak (1 from each - Japan, Australia, and US). The Japanese version was the tastiest, but of course the fattiest - - but oohhhh so good.\nThe filet mignon and t-bone were also cooked to a perfect medium rare, both juicy and tender.\n\nOverall, great service, great food, awesome desserts and we all left full and happy.", "author": "Louisa W."}

We had no idea what we were in for.\n\nAmbiance:  Imagine if you were at a steakhouse in Vegas....except...ooh wait! were in SF!  Probably one of the nicest restaurants I have been to in SF.  Great place to take someone for a special occasion.\n\nService:  Our waitress was excellent.  We let her know it was our first time here and she was happy to offer up her recommendations.  Oh yeah and the fact that I felt like the person who kept filling up my water never let it get below half-empty...I almost felt like he was staring at me and looking forward to the moment I drank my water just so he could fill it up. Excellent!!\n\nFood:  So we ordered the hamachi shooters to start and they were definitely tasty and well balanced, probably not worth the $4 price though.  We then went along and ordered the truffle fries as per the recommendations of the Yelpers.  We had NO IDEA,  these fries were amazing,  you could taste that truffle oil taste it gave them.  Every time I bit into one, crispy on the outside while cooked through just enough, while not being too oily at the same time.  These are a must order. \n\nFor my entree I got the dry-aged bone in NY steak 22o.z. and yes it was HUGE.  About 30% of it was fat which gave it great flavor throughout and I somehow managed to gobble it all up.  A testament to how good it was... My GF got the 4o.z. Australian Kobe, which looked laughably small, especially compared to mine, but this piece of meat which my GF savored was definitely lean and high quality,  I can't imagine how good that would taste if we had ordered the 8o.z. of it.\n\nWe finished all this off with a Carrot Cake Souffle, and when it was brought to the table, they basically cracked it open and poured this creamy,sugar glaze over it so that it soaked from the top into the souffle.  This amazing dessert was the perfect way to top off one of the most amazing meals.\n\nOverall:  Yes this place is pretty pricey, but its a nice place to go for a special occasion.

An upscale restaurant this is NOT.  The food is spotty and incosistent (although the idea is good), and the other A, B, Cs of a fine establishment, like service or decent bathrooms are just not there.  A very unsatisfying experience for the money if you are expecting class.  \"Disposable\" paper menus.  Out of mint -- no mojitos.  Waiters cleaning bathrooms.  Need I write more?  Anyway, here is the story: \n\nWe went on a Saturday night, the place was not crowded.  We had reservations for the six of us, not ready when we arrived, so we sat at the lounge and aparently the manager forgot about us because half an hour later we had to point out that there were a couple of booths empty so we were moved.  Promised complimentary desert, but were charged for it.  Also an extra bottle of wine added to the check; on the third try I had to tell the manager that we just want a check that is accurate.\n\nThe waitstaff is inexperienced at best, the girl who waited on us was pretty and polite, but it may have been not just her first time waitressing, but the first day working at all!  \nWhile waiting for our cocktails I looked around to see her standing with a perplexed look on her face, holding our cocktails and staring at my husband who was gesticulating animatedly as he was telling a story.  I finally had to beckon her to our table, and pass around the cocktails myself, as she was obviously too shy to approach.  Hmmm... I think she's in the wrong field.  Anyway, the appetizers were good and inventive; especially the carpaccio roll which is a great idea and really eazes your fears of \"what is happening to all that expensive meat no one is ordering?\"  \n\nWe did not stay for main course, because I do believe in that rule of \"if the bathroom is a mess, you may not want to eat here\".   It looks like a mega-movie theater bathroom, with stalls on both sides of a long table with puddles of water all over it.  But co-ed, so you have to do your business with the guy next door to you. And naturally there is a smell, well, it is co-ed and on Saturday nights some lose their aim.  There is nothing to cut the smell, there is only the cheap liquid soap and those uber cheap paper towels (but fanned out so as to... look more sophisticated?)  I mean, honestly, invest in some air freshener or fruity soap!\n\nBut the worst was seeing a waiter (who I had seen at another table), cleaning the bathroom trashcans (very simple home depot backyard cans, \"dressed\" with black garbage bags). I NEVER want to see any waiter, even if he's not tending to my table, packing the trashbag in the bathroom!  Anyway, I guess I could have pointed that out to the manager, but it's his show, and he seemed overwhelmed even with the limited number of people he was dealing with already.  I give this place six months, they already seem to be turning to ultra-cheap happy hour to pay the bills, but I say it's going to go by way of Le Suite, Sutra, etc.  Not being mean, but this place needs to shape up or get out.", "author": "Localista I."}

I had some concerns after reading some of the reviews here and almost bolted to Kokkari next door.  \n\nFirst and foremost, the interior is amazing.  I really enjoyed their goal here, A Steak Lounge.  Something trendy and hip, but at the same time a place you can get a decent steak.  \n\nTheir appetizers were excellent.  The shooters, crab leags, the fries (YUM!) all were amazing.\n\nThe main courses, we had the NY Steak (which wa snoit sliced), the Filet (which I had) and the Sea Bass.  The two who ordered the NY Steak thought it was good, but were sexond guessed the size of it.  However, both were not hungry when they left the place.  My friend who had the sea bass said it was \"AMAZING\".  My fillet was excellent and at $30, much better priced than the one I had at Harris the night before (yes, I splurged for my bday weekend).\n\nNo one tried the high end meats they were offering.  They were  alittle bit out of our range.\n\nFor our side, we had the Mac N Cheese, which we LOVED!!!!!!.\n\nThe desserts were the only thing we were disapointed with.  The Creme Du Brulee was very milky  and my Chocalate dessert was dry.  There was a some sort of Merengue dessert, which we were very impressed.  However, overall the desserts were average. \n\nThe staff is excellent.  Very friendly and courteous and professional.\n\nThank you 5A5 for a great experience", "author": "Peter P."}

We're talking OMG O-face good.   If I am offered a last meal before my execution, I might have to have these.  Am I making myself clear?  Now on to the rest of the story.  This is a very cool upscale classy place to hang, have solid if slightly cute/self-important food, and to see and be seen.  This is not a classic steakhouse, but more of a fusion fine dining hybrid.  If you want thick sizzling steaks, giant old school drinks and a pile of hot sourdough, this is not your place.  But it's pretty damn good and fun. Came on a Saturday at 9 for dinner and by 11 the place turned into a club scene, complete with gorgeous babes, leering douchebags, goon doormen, red velvet ropes, etc.  You know the drill.  If that doesn't turn you off (I think it's sort of fun, actually), go here.  Or go early.  Very solid eats, and yup, I am coming back.", "author": "Mitchell S."}

I did not dine here.\n\nmet some friends here for happy hour on Friday afternoon.  always like to give bars a chance to show their stuff by ordering something they've come up with and put on their cocktail menu.  the cocktail menu at 5A5 is so vodka and female-centric (all of the drinks were sweet and/or pink), so we decided to let them make us some old standbys.  asked the bartender if they had a particular sweet vermouth (that anyone who knows their drinks would have on-hand).  the female bartender showed me a bottle of 'well' vermouth.  sorry, honey, not even close.  she grabbed the bar manager, and he just gave me blank stare.  so that pretty much means I have to resort to the easiest-to-make drinks in order to not be completely disappointed.  we ordered a manhattan and a 209/tonic.  you really can't screw up a G&T, but this was definitely the worst manhattan I've ever had.  and you gotta be fresh outta bartending school with no taste for real drinks to not make a acceptable manhattan.\n\nI don't expect to have a life-changing cocktail at every bar I go to, but when you open a new restaurant with a decent bar during SF Cocktail Week, perhaps you can pretend that you care?  perhaps your bartenders can pretend like they know something about their jobs (beyond how to make a cosmo or a vodka/tonic)...  that doesn't seem like too much to ask...  or is it?  the clientele this night was 40+ years old for the most part, and those folks weren't drinking cosmos.  they are more likely to know their cocktails and couldn't have been pleased with the options last night, either...\n\nbecause we were enjoying our friends company, we went to order round #2.  female bartender forgot the order (as we stood in front of her for the next 15 mins).  had to re-order, then finished those drinks quickly and left.\n\neither way, I won't go back.  not even if the steak is life-changing.", "author": "Matt L."}

After reading the previous reviews I feel like I have to do something to offset some seriously crappy scores.  Look, people.... this was a SOFT OPENING.  The purpose of these trial runs are to test out the menu items and work on the flow in the kitchen and service.  They obviously accomplished this because I ate there tonight and had no complaints whatsoever.  In fact, I was quite pleased with the service and ambiance and have rave reviews for the food.\n\nWe started with the hamachi shooters which completely lived up to the reputation.  There is a bit of cilantro and just a sliver of jalapeno that really puts the dish over the top.  We also got the truffled fries which in all honesty, I've had way better of.  Fries are cut thicker than I usually like and there simply isn't enough truffle oil for my taste.  Then I had the pear mixed green salad which was pretty darn awesome.  Fresh, crisp and seasonal, the standards I hope my salads always meet.  \n\nMoving onto the main event - the A5 Wagyu steak.  I think you have to try this if you're going to accurately review this fine establishment.  HOLY CRAP this was good.  This is deserving of my first use of inappropriate language on Yelp since there is just no other way for me to express my feelings.  I'm ready to write an ode to the cow that was sacrificed for this beautiful piece of meat.  The little 4oz chunk of medium rare heaven in front of me literally brought me to tears.  And get this - I'm not a steak eater.  But I guess if you were going to shove a steak down my throat I'd ask for a ribeye.  Probably because of it's tendency to have some heavy marbling.  This wagyu had freaking INTENSE marbling.  The meat seriously melted in my mouth, slid straight down my throat and like.. wrapped around my heart.  But I didn't mind because I relished every glorious, artery-clogging moment of it. \n\nI sampled a bit of the lamb pops (good) and seabass (excellent) as well.  I can't take away any stars for the quality of my food tonight.  It was all perfect.  And to top it off, our awesome server Nate, brought us two complimentary desserts.  The vanilla bean creme brulee and a strawberry basil pavlova.  Gotta say the desserts could use a little work, but we were forwarned and they were on the house so I can't knock em for it.  Judging from the early reviews and what I experienced tonight, I have absolute faith that they will work this part out just was well as they have worked out the rest of the growing pains. \n\nWine list could use a little help as well.  Especially if they want to be taken seriously as a true steakhouse.  I'm eager to come back to check out the scene at night.  I think they have massive potential for developing a pretty sweet lounge or happy hour spot.  They certainly have prime real estate for it.\n\nAll in all, one of the best meals I've had in SF to date.  Perhaps because it was private and mellow.  But you all have the chance to experience it for yourselves for at least  another three weeks before they open to the public.", "author": "Virginia L."}

It's everything anyone under 40 could ever hope for in a steak house. I recently was \"forced\" to spend the night in sf in which I had the distinct pleasure of dining here. \"dining\" isn't even a fair assessment of what happens when you experience this place, but for now, just go with it. We started with oysters and truffle fries, quite the intoxicating combo. After a couple of glasses of wine our main courses arrived. The plates came in perfect timing to allow us to really soak in the environment and the company. I went with the \"dry aged t-bone\" which allowed me to be the man-bear-pig that I truly am . The other Plate was the \"Colorado lamb duo\" of which I'm sure soley derived its quality from the fact that it comes from \"Colorado\"...  Seriously though, it was delicious, and put quite the smile on her face. Besides the nearly $250 (a lot of which was alcohol) tab I'd have to say it was definitely a \"must\" experience. A brilliant meal and an endless supply of brownie points. Do treat yourself. On a side note, I mark \"no\" in the \"good for kids\" section every time, mainly because I don't dine at chunky cheese, but also because I don't want to share my dinner experience with your children.

My sister and I hit it up last Saturday night and we were both blown away - if you think I am opinionated, I have nothing on Alison.  We each started with the hamachi shooter - yummy!!  We did the Dine about Town and were all about the sharing.  I did iceberg salad, NY steak with bleu cheese, and chocolate mousse.  Alison did the caesar salad, filet mignon, and strawberry dessert.  We also did the mashed potatoes to share as a side. Iceberg salad hands down was the winner - it was delicious with big chunks of bacon.  The caesar was good but had a little too much dressing for me.  Both the steaks were amazing but filet mignon was melt in your mouth.  The chocolate mousse was to die for - the strawberry dessert was okay.  But the mashed potatoes - holy sh*t - I dream about them now.  They were unbelievably fluffy and light - topped with chives, cheese, and big chunks of bacon.  They were heavenly.  To keey with the bacon theme, to start they give you regular bread and bacon bread.  Any restaurant that loves bacon has my heart.

It's definitely a trendier take on traditional steak houses in all aspects -- from the decor, to the cocktails to the great options of vegetarian and fish served.  Our table wasn't quite ready, so we headed the bar/lounge. I ordered the Derby, which was a martini's take on a hot totti (bourbon, lemon, maple syrup).  It was delicious, but a little too sweet.  I would advise ordering light on the syrup (for all cocktails --  I tasted my hubby's and his lychee martini was super sweet too).  My second was muuuuch better.  They also have a good wine list.  Once we were seated, we ordered a few app's -- which were hit and miss.  The chicken yakitori and salmon pastrami were delicious, and the cerviche served shooter style were good, but not enough for 2.   The lobster shooter lacked flavor, and the sauce it served with was like any other cocktail sauce you've had before.  I did like the hibachi shooter better though.  For dinner we ordered the petit filet and the lamb -- both were *delicious* and melt-in-your-mouth perfect, as our server had promised.  For the sides, I'd highly recommend the mac & cheese and mashed potatoes, which are served with a Japanese curry sauce...ahhhh, comfort!  We enjoyed the chocolate dessert, but I wouldn't recommend the carrot cake (especially if you normally love carrot cake, like I do -- you'll be disappointed) I'm not sure if we'd travel all the way downtown for this place again, but it was good...especially if you're there for the steak.  I'd recommend if you're already in the area or for a business dinner.", "author": "Amber K."}

It was really easy getting a reservation and adjusting it when I had to up the amount of guest coming.  It was all our first time here and didn't know what to start with.  The server was super friendly and helpful, not to mention patient with our indecisiveness.  \n\nFor appetizers we had the truffle fries and lobster tempura. The fries were a bit too spicy for my super sensitive palette but the lobster tempura was delicious. It wasn't over cooked or over breaded, sharing was a bit difficult.  Also shared the Mac n Cheese, so DELICIOUS that I wish yelp had HTML so i could emphasize more. \n\nAll of our main courses came together which was really nice. I'm always the person whose food gets forgotten or they ran out of or it just gets ordered incorrectly. So, although a simple task, it was like a blessing to me. For my main course I got the seabass, i know it's a steak place but I'm not really a red meat person.  The seabass was cooked just right, still moist but fully cooked all the way through. I hate when fish is over cooked and dry. \n\nThroughout the meal the staff was really friendly and kept our glasses full.  I left for the restroom (FYI, it was very clean, always a plus) and when I came back there was a dessert waiting for me at the table. I'm not sure who ordered the doughnuts, since I'm not really a doughnut person, but they were good, didn't eat a lot of them.  The ice-cream, however, that came with them was perfect, although I can't tell you what the flavor was (probably due to the drinking). \n\nOverall I had a great experience here.

Only complaint, they are really hard to get out of the shot glass. And given the fact that they are presented in a shot glass, you feel kinda silly using your fork but literally, you have to bang the glass a couple of times to get the thing out.\nOn the service front, everyone was super nice like I said but a few things that could be improved. We were never offered bread. When we later asked, we were told we had to request it. Ummm, not really feeling that. especially at a steak house. I shouldn't have to ask for bread, it should be bought. Next, we asked our server to decant the wine until our entrees were out. Great... except no one ever poured our wine period. We had to finally ask someone 10 minutes into our main course. And no one was offered a taste first. Again, if you're paying a decent $ on a bottle of wine, you expect to at least be offered to taste it first. lastly, the timing was a little off on our sides. The fries came out at the end of our meal which was a little disappointing because they were delicious!\nOverall the food was good. The salads were simple but refreshing and the meat was prepared well. The sides are on the smaller side so make sure you order enough.

Being steak fans, we love trying different high rated steak houses in the city so I found this place for us to try. Nice atmosphere. We were seated right away since I made reservations a month before. We look over the menu & I decide on my favorite cut the filet mignon & Jan chooses the porterhouse steak. For sides we decide on the mushrooms & spinach & order their famous truffle fries. When the truffle fries arrive, we were a bit surprised w/the large amount they served. It's definitely good enough for 3-4 people. Damn... those were good. We see why their pretty popular there. When we receive our steak & sides, we dive right in. Mm... yummy, juicy steaks. As for the sides... we didn't like so much. The mushrooms were ehh & the spinach tasted sour. I told Jan it tasted like sinigang (a sour filipino meat dish). He laughed & agreed it did taste like it so I kept calling it \"sinigang spinach.\" Haha... anyways, what we noticed about what some people mentioned on yelp is that the servers are attentive to you at first, but later on disappear. We didn't like how we had to wait w/empty water glasses for a long while & had to flag someone down when they went to another table near us. After we finished our food, we decide to order some dessert. We choose this earl grey tea flavored flan like thing. Forgot the name which was ok, not hella good. Overall, steaks & truffle fries were good except the sides. Wished the servers were just as attentive like they were in the beginning since it is an expensive restaurant.

Don't even think about going to their restaurant after you eat, you are going to throw up everything!  That under ground sewer pipe smell is sooooooo bad that you don't want to stay for a second.  Sadly, most people don't realize that's the smell from the sewer. The only bright spot was the service by the waiter.

Thats right, your dining experience is also a lounge experience that includes seeing the flat screen flames and the spring runway footage.\nFor the 30 somethings that don't mind, you will love it.  For those like me hanging on every word of my dazzling date, it wasn't as much fun.\nNow the food.\nPea soup with crab is breathtaking.\nThe peppers were luscious.\nThe sea was with peas and bacon was melt in your mouth delectable.\nThe buffalo steak was temperature perfect.\nFor dinner, the entrees were a bit small.  $18 an ounce for steak seems a bit ridiculous to me.  The Dazzling One could have eaten much more.\nThe wine selection was fun, we switched wines.\nWho knew that doughnuts could be so delectable?  I recommend these highly.  So fresh that the sugar is melting on their softly crunchy surfaces with peach ice cream that makes you feel like the juice is running down your arm.\nIf we could have enjoyed our dinner with a bit more peace and a bit less like dining with the noise level of a pub, I would have rated this place higher.

I ordered a rare kobe steak and it came back almost well done.  I didnt want to send it back because they had already taken the wrong order and I had to wait longer to get my steak.  Anyway, maybe if it was rare it would have been better.  \n\nBut the size of the steak was very small.  I think they look at the person ordering it and then decide which size piece to bring out, since they tell you that they have a female portion of the steak.  I think this is wrong!  I think they should just bring the same for everyone.  I did not ask for a female portion but I got one anyway.  The regular size portions are not that big anyway.  \n\nAlso this is the last time I will be fooled by the name \"KOBE\" !

After I ate every little morsel of my fish to the point of if I had been at home I would have licked my plate clean!!! We choose our dessert, I think we all went with this little slice of heaven which was a chocolate peanut butter marshmallow graham cracker plate of greatness. It was so good I was talking about it for 3 days straight and I still day dream about it. All of the other girls got the fillet Mignon which they raved about through out the rest of the dinner.

I started off we the hamachi shooters (presentation = 4 stars, taste = 3 stars). The house green salad is very light and delightful. The seabass is on the fishy side and it comes with a dipping sauce that takes away the fishiness but does not complement the fish at all. The side of spinach is average but the asphargus is good. For dessert, we ordered the basil dessert, chocolate decadence, creme brulee and the apple tart with ice cream. The basil dessert is good: two cookies with cream filling and fresh strawberry that tickled my tastebuds and made my ears snap. The chocolate decadence is not bad with mousse and cake wrapped around a block of dark chocolate--not too sweet. The apple tart is good except the crust is too mushy that I had to work at it to cut with both a knife and fork. I didn't even bother to try the creme brulee based on the fact that there is not sufficient sugar coating on the top and after torching it my spoon easily broke through the top barrier.  My friends said it is nothing special.\n\nFood wise I would give it 3 stars but if service and ambiance included in the packaging then I would give it a 4 stars. The waiter Jim did a great job with servicing us and kept on coming back to ask us if we needed anything us and how our food was. My girlfriend didn't know whether to choose the zinfindale or the cabernet so Jim brought a 1/4 glass (more generous than any sample sized I ever seen) for her to try.

Hello?? You don't bump into girls like that.  We moved onto the dance floor.  There was a group of girls dancing behind us.  One girl kept bumping into us several times.  It was actually more like a push.  Like I said, this place isn't THAT crowded.  She never even said sorry.  Her friends didn't even notice how rude they were.  People are way nicer at even ghetto clubs.  Anyway, as I walked back to my table.  There was a girl sitting on a guy's lap right in the middle of the aisle.  She had on a tight short skirt and her legs were spread.  I could see her panties.  They were borderline doing something I shouldn't say...  Very disgusting.  Oh yeah, my friend saw a guy walking on the dance floor and just spit on the ground! Gross.\n\nThis place sounds like a great place to have a steak.  I may return.  But I am turned off by all the fakeness this place attracts at night.  Yes, everyone looks classy but it's disgusting.  I am almost afraid to come back to eat.  I don't know what people do on those lounge chairs.  I hope that if I come back I can change this review to 4 stars.  Until then, 2 will work.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Unfortunately our experience was a disappointing one.\n\nStarting from the bar, the bartender greeted us not too long after we approached the bar.  Which is good.  I asked her what their happy hour specials are.  She said they don't have happy hour specials.  They were not officially opened yet.  I mentioned the email invitation I received for the happy hours at A5 during their Family & Friends Pre-Opening period.    She didn't know anything about it.  I invited my friends to a happy hour and there was no happy hour.  That was the first disappointment.  \n\nThen we ordered 2 drinks and 2 food items from their pre-opening menu, hamachi shooters and sea bass.  My experience with their hamachi shooter is the same as the other yelper, cool idea, but executed poorly.  It was challenging to \"shoot\" the shooters.  The shot glass they used to serve the hamachi, was very thick and rough quality.  It's definitely the type of serving dish/glass quality I would not expect to experience at an upscale restaurant.   The flavor was good not great, but hard to get to the chunks of the hamachi when they were stuck at the bottom of the shot glass.  They did not serve them with any cocktail forks or shellfish picks.  We had to turned the glass upside down and shake it a few times above our mouth to get them down.  A friend of mine wasn't so lucky and used her fingers instead.  I know.  What we did were definitely dinning etiquette No-No's\".  We didn't appreciate that either.   Our 2nd disappointment.  \n\nThen the sea bass arrived, the sea bass itself was tasty without the sauce. It's lightly pan-fried on two sides of the filet until they are crusty.  That gave the sea bass a kick on the taste.  I wasn't too impressed with the sauce, nothing more than an easy Chinese sauce I make at home with soy sauce, scallion and spiced oil.  The sea bass was tasty, but not \"WOW, how did they do it?\".  Instead it was more like \"oh, I can do this at home.\" and for 1/4 of the price.  3rd disappointment.  \n\nAfter the above 3 disappointments, more people arrived, the lounge got crowded and noisy, we decided to relocate for dinner.  \n\nI might go back again to give their steak a try since that's supposed to be what they are good at.  I am not a big fan of steaks, but once in a while I get the craving for a piece of gourmet juicy steak!", "author": "Gina W."}

I would've given the food 2.5 stars, but our waiter, WES, was totally smirky and rude, After tipping him well over 20%, he had the nerve to have a cocktail where we were at after dinner, and talk shit about how we were stupid- when really, he was the one that provided us with mediocre service and rude comments. Basically, if you want to get mediocre, overpriced food and rude service, go to 5A5 Steakhouse. I think that you could have better service and food by going to a chain like Ruth's Chris Steak house.

I cant explain how tasty these taste-so-good-but-so-bad-for-you fries are... And the edamame... mmm... Whatever they put on those yummy soy beans equals ahhhh-mazing... \n\nOk so its a Steak Lounge therefore, I had to try their steaks...

They were all melt-in-your-mouth goood... great... deeeeelish...

We had dinner reservations but decided to get there early and kick it at the lounge for about an hour to get our dranks on. Generous pours on the hard liquor!  Point!  From that moment on, I had a feeling that the evening was just gonna keep getting mo betta!  For munchies, we got some oyster shooters and some salmon shooters...both of them were real good! By 6:30 on a Friday night, the lounge was starting to fill up.  It was all good with the dj spinning jams in the back...real chill like. Off to the dining area. Wait staff was real friendly, attentive, helpful, and extremely knowledgable about the menu's offerings. We started off with the lobster tempura. Holy shat! That thang was so good!  If you eat here, you gotta get it!  The lobster meat was so sweet and tender!  Between my boys and me, none of us went all out to order the A5 wagyu cuts of meat. Shipped directly from japan, they were about $28 an ounce.  Instead, my boys odered a bone-in rib-eye and a porterhouse. They both liked their steaks and they were done just right! Cooked perfectly!  The ribeye is 25oz, and that mofo was huge!  Monstrous!  I had the bone-in ny strip! 22oz of perfectly cooked heaven on a plate! Sooooooo freaking good!  Three bruthas with three phat steaks....it was like that carls jr commercial, \"don't bother me. I'm eating!\" and mine was topped with truffle butter.  Yeah! For sides we had the mac n cheese which was pretty good....the portobello mushrooms topped with cheese was good.  The baby bok choy  topped with pancetta was just aight.  Kinda disappointed that a steak joint this good didn't offer brocolli or asparagus. Overall, excellent steaks! We will mos def come back! The shooters are really good! Heavy handed pours from the bar!  Very friendly service from beginning to end! A great evening with my two bros!  5A5 is the spot yall!", "author": "Peter M."}

We started with the Hamachi Shooters which are bits of Hamachis, scallions, ginger, ponzu sauce in a shoot glass. Next came the delicious mini Kobe burgers.Two on a plate, maybe not enough as a dinner for a guy but definitely enough for a girl. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. It also came with these yummy fries. The hoisin ribs and chips were delicious. Four good size ribs and the sauce is so good. Smoke salmon squares were great. The were small cubes with a mini, very mini toast. The truffle fries dipped in sriracha aioli is very addicting. Our favorite of the meats... the dry aged bone in NY in truffle sauce was the best. The bone-in rib eye was also great. The prime rib came with 3 slices. I think the magic is in the sauce, especially the truffle sauce. The size of the meat is very generous. Probably great for the guys but for the girl, you will want a doggie bag. Our favorite sides were the mash potato with chunks of bacon with a cheddar cheese topping and the spinach. We especially loved the mash potato. It was thick and creamy. We finished off with 7 decadence chocolate. 7 different kinds of chocolate, a green tea chocolate, lavender chocolate, milk chocolate, chocolate dust, a big chuck of some sort of chocolate and I can't even remember the other two. The portions were very very generous. I also liked that we can hear ourselves talked unlike many of the restaurants nowadays.

Drinks arrived promptly.  The wine director was friendly but we could hardly hear him over the heavy bass in the music.  That might have been my biggest complaint--I was sitting at a table with two girlfriends and only heard every third word, even though we were all shouting.  The music was just obnoxiously loud.  There is a DJ in house, and I wonder whether they feel compelled to show that he's doing his job, but it was really horrendously loud.  I'd never bring a business contact or even a friend I wanted to catch up with here unless I hear that they've moderated that somehow.  It was so bad that we asked them to turn it down, but I'm not sure they did.  \n\n Cesar salads arrived quickly and were delicious--not overly dressed.  THEN the wait began.  We waited about 45 minutes between salads and our entrees.  I couldn't believe it.  The restaurant was not even half full, I can't imagine what was going on, but worst of all, no one said anything to us.  I understand kitchen snafus, I understand that they kitchen might be backed up, but for goodness' sake, stop by and apologize and tell me it will still be a bit.  Don't just leave me guessing!  At about 40 minutes, when we must have started looking anxious (we were starved!), the waitress brought out complimentary shots of soup, but didn't explain that they were to make up for the delay (though we guessed).  So at least there was that...\n\nI had been thinking about steak all day as I'd known we were going to this restaurant, and I was not impressed with the NY steak at all.  It was tough, I asked for it rare and it arrived medium to well, and it was COLD.  It is served on a strange little oblong plate that wasn't really easy to eat from.  \n\nWe ordered spinach, truffle fries, mac-n-cheese, asparagus and mushroom sides.  The mac-n-cheese was absolutely scrumptious, the truffle fries were nice and the asparagus and mushrooms were decent.  THe spinach was gross and cold.  \n\nThe decor was cool, but they really need to put a little effort into the stairs and the downstairs.  It was just shocking to see the kind of shape that was in compared to the upstairs.  \n\nThe smoking patio was a cool idea and was popular.  \n\nThe busboys were anxious to help, but kept trying to take our food before we were finished!  \n\nI'm hopeful they'll finish working out the kinks, but I'm not sure how it will do.", "author": "CeeBee H."}

No this is not a sports bar, but the clientele seemed to think so.\nWe were ushered to the back area (not the pit in the center) and I hoped it was quiet and conducive for \"dining.\" Starters/appetizers were a caesar salad with awful pickled anchovies (ruined the taste of the salad) and the lobster that came with a dish of vinegar sauce??? Come on this sauce added nothing and was dreadful.  The vegetable choice was spinach and it showed up with what looked like wood shavings (a la pencil sharpener) piled on top of the spinach.  The taste was horrible and when the waiter provided the details that it was toasted and extremely thinly sliced filo pastry.  Again, stop trying to be so chic...this was another misstep.  Now for the steaks the dry aged rib eye could have been used for shoe repair and of course had no flavor.  This was just old meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-03", "description": "5a5 Steakhouse is the whole package.  The gf and I went over here for her birthday because a friend recommended the restaurant to me.  When we first walked in, we instantly felt a cozy vibe that is reminiscent of some of the elegant steakhouses I've been to in LA.  The fireplaces and music playing in the background explained why it was called a steak lounge and not just another steakhouse.  This was no house, it was definitely a lounge.  The bar area was packed with people.  Good thing we had reservations in the dining room.\n\nThe dining room is highlighted by the uniquely shaped light fixture overhead.  The waiter was friendly and helped answer all of our questions and we opted to try their hamachi shooters and truffle fries as the appetizers. Before the food ever came out, however, we were offered some bread.  Now, some places give you stale, cold bread... and it's ok since most people don't eat it.  Other places have really good bread, but you feel bad because you don't want to ruin your appetite.  Well, save some room for the bread here.  BACON BREAD!  Seriously, it was amazing.  I bit into it not expecting the lightly salted flavor burst that I experienced.  Wow.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I couldn't stop myself from asking for a second bread basket.  But, I had to stop because we had a lot more food to come.\n\nSoon the appetizers arrived.  Unbelievable. Best truffle fries I've ever had by far.  I noticed that both items were also on the bar menu for happy hour and also noticed a few other items on there that they have specials for... definitely need to come back for some happy hour drinks with friends to try out the other items.  And, I can't forget to mention the hamachi shooters which were incredibly fresh and a very unique way to have some great lightly garnished sashimi.  They also have shooters with oysters or tuna sashimi if you prefer that.  They were definitely an appetizing way to begin the dinner.\n\nFor the main entree, we opted for their A5 wagyu and the rib eye.  First off, that wagyu is absolutely unbelievable.  Yes, there are other great steakhouses in SF, but how many have real A5 grade wagyu?  I hear that they also have samplers with kobe steak and A5 wagyu from America and Australia... I'm dying to try that out.  But, the American A5 wagyu we tried was out of this world.  We were told we have to get it medium rare (which is perfect for me) and you'll know why the second you bite into it.  It's like biting into a little slice of steak heaven.  The beef practically melts in your mouth.  We balanced it with their ribeye which was rock solid, but definitely could not compare to their wagyu.  It was juicy and marbled like a good steak should be, but I think we were in steak-heaven from the wagyu.  Next time we'll either go with 2 wagyu's or two or something else...  I wouldn't want anything else to try and compare with the A5 steak.  \n\nWe couldn't end the evening without some dessert, so we tried their green tea donuts.  They were light and fluffy and surprisingly good.  We shared the dessert because we were stuffed from everything else we had ordered, but I hear that they have a new bread pudding that is out of this world.  Oh man... I can't wait to come back and try more of their food.", "author": "Jim K."}

Its in the top 5 steakhouses in San Francisco cuz San Francisco only has 5 steakhouses and this place is #5.  The salad lacked sufficient dressing and ingredients.  I had the filet mignon, med-rare.  The beef was ok, nothing to rave about.  Served warm.  Honestly, Rancher Reserve Beef is better.  It was over peppered and the savory shitake mushroom sauce was merely worcestershire mixed with two slim slices of shitake mushroom cooked down.  BTW, meals are a la carte.  The mac n cheese was not bad, but how can you go wrong if you add lots of cheese to the mac?  The spinach had an asian twist to it, but just blah.   Dinner was 2.5 hours long because most of the time you just waited for your order to arrive.  It took the wait service more than 15 minutes to refill my water glass, providing if you can wave one down.  The waiter did not even bother is ask if you wanted coffee and it took more than 15 minutes to get the dinner bill.  Another 15 minutes for the staff to acknowledge the credit card used to pay your bill.  FYI, make sure you don't drop any morsels on the table because the waiter will not even pick it up.  Yes, we just sat there making the morsels a conversation piece.", "author": "Koa K."}

Went for a friends birthday.  ordered a 5 dollar ginger ale from the bar.  I guess i dont mind paying 5 dollars for a soda as long as the food is good.  Once we were seated everything went down hill.  We put a rush on our order because we had to go to work, some of the people in our party got there food right away, but 20 mins later there was nothing in front of me and i couldnt find my waitress.  When she finally came back to the table she blamed everthing on the kitchen.  You can blame whomever you want but you should have come back to check on us 20 minutes ago.  i ordered the 7 ounce NY and when she brought it out she assured me it was supposed to say 6 ounces.  It was tasteless.  The truffle fries werent bad but its nothing new.  Broke 65 dollars for a meal i could have made better at home for about 8 dollars and bad service.  They want 250 for a bottle of champagne, thats a club price not a resturaunt price.  You cant make up for what you are losing on bad food by ripping people off on the liquor.  Granted this was a soft opening but it was like the 30th soft opening.  Cool looking placesw with lousy food and service will die in San Francisco.  Young people with bad taste cannot support your business in this city, maybe in LA, but in SF theres more old money than new money, and old people want good service and good food.  They dont give a damn about looking cool or knowing the owners.  Sorry a5.  Nice venue though, maybe you should restaff and pay a good chef good money to come in and redo the kitchen.  Till then good luck.", "author": "Jonathan S."}

We ventured out even though we were on a restrictive diet, knowing that our host pre-arranged our dietary needs were acceptable to the chef.  Well, we have no way of knowing whether the chef would work with us, because the waitress acted like we were in one of those cheap diners where it says at the bottom of the menu: no substitutions. \n\nFirst, we can't drink wine (thank god this isn't forever - just a 21 week cleanse). I asked for a wine glass and a lemon to go along with my sparkling water (read: the same price as a glass of nice wine per bottle!). She balked at it and never brought the lemon. \n\nThen came the menu discussion. We can eat essentially any vegetable and lean protein, with olive oil and any spices.  Help us, waitress, navigate! NO WAY. She put up road block after road block. We asked questions about whether we could have the seared fish with a variety of vegetables - a variation of their menu items. NOPE. She \"did not think\" the chef would make and changes or do anything different for us. Key phrase: \"did not think.\"  My husband ended up ordering a variety of vegetable sides - no variation except leaving the fried onions off the top was \"allowed\". He asked that they be plated together so he could have a semblance of a meal instead of three side plates in front of him. NOPE. I asked for the salmon without the fried tofu crab cake (tofu is off the cleanse menu) - and that is what I got. A square of unadorned salmon smack in the middle of my plate. My guess is the kitchen expeditor probably questioned it, and she gave the terse go ahead to serve me a plate with absolutely no presentation. No sprig of greenery? Nothing! \n\nShe never checked back to see how we were doing or how our meal was. I want to be clear that we presented our weird eating situation with a sense of humor - we are both ex-service folks and understand how hard it CAN be to be a great waiter. I was not expecting miracles, just a little help (like the Four Seasons gave us when we went there - the most amazing all vegetarian lunch served straight from the mind of the chef.) Let me also say that this was not a busy night at the restaurant - it was half empty.  \n\nSo what is her excuse?? It's too bad, the interior of the restaurant is cool and the rest of the staff seemed friendly. The service we happened to get just left a bad taste in my mouth.", "author": "David B."}

When we commented about needing a booth (needing :) the hostess informed us \"all of our tables are booths. What a great idea. Service was attentive to say the least. And can I say.....very young. But knowledgeable and friendly. They started our meal with a complimentary glass of champagne. In this time period of second-guessing every penny we spend-especially on our food, this was fantastic. Any number of SF restaurants can have our business. Perks like this keep a guest coming back. Beef Tataki, King Crab Legs, Iceberg Salad, Truffle Fries, Asparagus, Mac n Cheese, and of course the main attraction - steaks. Overall - there were no duds in anything we ordered. The red wine that the sommelier helped to pick was great - a label that read Vicarious- full bodied red. Very nice. A highlight - those king crab legs. So buttery and delicious. The decor - almost there. Beautiful bar, the booths are stylish and comfortable, the lighting is cozy and modern at the same time. It seemed that the areas not completely in full view needed a little attention. The loo situation - not great. Hopefully that will be fixed and a restroom will be added to the main floor. And what is happening with the mirrors on the back of the restroom door? If you wanted to check your teeth, hair, or anything else troubling that isn't happening inthe bathroom. The mirror is situated at the waist level....suspect. The party room looked a bit sad. Maybe with a different party group it would have felt different. The crowd on a Friday evening was kinda strange. An interesting mix of downtown after-work types, first dates (interesting people watching), tacky guys on the make, and some low key foodies. I went with a group of 3 other people. I think that is how I would return to the restaurant. And yes, I will be returning. This was a great evening with delicious food.", "author": "Tom R."}

We didn't get the Kobe beef burger because they didn't have it before the grand opening.  So, we came back here with a friend on Tuesday night. We had the Tuesday special: 2 little piece of meat on a wooden stick for $1...hmm, pretty good price, but it's just not that good.  We also had the Hamachi, Poke and Oyster shooters, those are pretty fresh, tasty and beautifully presented on a plate of salt.   When our 2nd round of drinks came, things started to go wrong.  the waitress accidentally dropped a tray of drinks right next to my friend, so her shoes were soaked in champagne, and she got splashes all over her pants.  the waitress apologized and we moved on to a different seating.  We decided to try the mini kobe burgers with fries.  The meat patty is juicy and tasty, but the bun is way too thick.  I love the fries though.   The Waitress tried to convince us to stay for dinner, but we decided to pass.  No offer to dry clean my friend's pants and her suede shoes, and no discount on the tap, i think i will have my dinner somewhere else.", "author": "Sophia L."}

We didn't have reservations and surprisingly didn't wait too long. The one thing that bothered me when we walked in was the set up for the \"hostess stand.\" I didn't care for that set up. I feel they should have had some visible stand or something seperating the entrance part slightly to the hostess area. It is a bit odd and disorganized in that section. Other than that, I liked the rest of the set up. Very interesting. I liked the circular aspect of the dining area as well as the lounge/bar area in the front of the restaurant. Our waitress was pretty attentive and friendly, I enjoyed that. I ordered a beef carpaccio appetizer, which looked like sushi rolls. I liked them. I think they could have used a little bit more flavor, but overall not bad at all. I enjoyed them and the artistry of the dish. I enjoyed my glass of chardonnay as well. They did not have the Riesling that I suggested getting, so the waitress recommended another and it was not bad. My boyfriend and I shared the main entree which was the rib eye witha truffle butter. We ordered corn and spinach for sides. The spinach was just a bit too \"garlicky.\" I could've dealt without so much garlic. I am a fan of it, but it was too much, so much that it took away from the spinach and other possible seasonings. The corn had an interesting citrus/lime like flavor that you had to acquire a taste for. The steak was not bad. My boyfriend, unfortunately, likes things well done! However, it was still pretty juicy and pretty tender too. The truffle butter is always one of my favorites as a seasoning! Umm...We ordered the donuts for dessert. It came with some sort of exotic flavored ice cream and also a raspberry jam to dip the donuts in. Not bad at all! Pretty yummy. We enjoyed that to finish off our dinner. Needless to say, it was all pretty good for my first experience as a whole. I would definitely go back! Oh, and before I go, one more thing I didn't like, I have to say was the elevator to take the bathroom down! That was a tad ridiculous but I heard that they had no choice because the plumbing was all downstairs and they couldn't change up the location? Something like that. So the bathrooms are downstairs and I have to say they could do a WAY better job sanitation wise down there. I felt like I was at a nightclub bathroom! And it's a little too dark in there too!", "author": "ST1223 T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-13", "description": "And they say money cannot buy happiness.  Well, whoever said that haven't dine at 5A5.  This is a classic example of a restaurant where you pay an exorbitant amount for just a tiny tiny portion, so be prepared to empty your wallets and leave hungry.  But then, you would leave with quite an exquisite experience, one that is truly unique and memorable.  So couple of my friends and I went and ordered several appetizers, including the \"shot\", some sorta sushi roll, the lobster and vegetable sides.  My advise? Nothing particularly memorable but if you had to choose, go for the lobster dish and dis the rest.  The sides are not particularly expensive so no need to hold back too much.  Now comes the expensive part.  I can only comment on what we ordered and we all ordered the \"Wagu\" rib eye (except one who ordered the filet mignon)  which cost $17 per ounce.  If you're wondering how much that is, well, it is a very small portion (maybe 3 full size bites, smaller than your palm) and cost over $70.  Now, that's expensive.  However, the first bite left me speechless, truly something I never tasted before.  Very tender, fatty and marbled.  It was very comparable to eating great quality toro but with more flavor.  Truly exquisite and an absolute treat for the palate.  This is some real quality stuff and cannot be compared to the meat served at Harris or HOPR.  Don't get me wrong, I love HOPR to death, but it's just different.  I'm a huge fan of red meat and must say this is truly some quality stuff, beyond my expectations.  Desserts? Tasty and fun but nothing too impressive.  In summary, the definite highlight was the \"Wagu\" beef and I feel like it is one of those things you must try before you hit the grave.  The problem is that the price makes this not accessible to many people and I feel that for the price they charge you, they definately can give you a larger portion.  So, 5 stars for the quality of the meat but 3 stars for their exceedingly small portions so average 4 stars.  I think I will return soon to try their less expensive cuts, possibly the Australian kobe or Buffalo cut.", "author": "Jerek L."}

The place was pretty empty...maybe because nobody knew they were open lol?? Because the main dining room was so empty, we opted for just a drink in the lounge to decide on food after. Our bartender, Amy was sweet and knew a lot about some questions on liquors my boyfriend asked.The bar lounge vibe was very relaxed and soothing, yet the music lacked versatility ( think the same cd kept playing) I like the ambiance in the dining room, when we ate dinner in it last time it was very modern but cozy. As i looked around, I noticed that other than the pink spaceship lights, there wasn't much else to look at... not even a bouquet of fresh flowers.Instead, there was a tree in the middle of the main room that looked dead. I've visited some other restaurants more recently that are outiffitted warmly in holiday decor, and I expected 5A5 to be dressed up for the occasion too, but sadly they are not.  Drinks were great, the ultimate martini that we had was among the best I've had! Sadly though, we didn't stay for dinner.

I love my steaks and have traveled the world and eaten at what some people would say is the best steakhouses in the world.  Well... I have to give it up to 5A5.  Their steaks were awesome.  I couldn't decide between the Kobe Ribeye Cap or the Kobe filet mignon.  So......  I just ordered both!!!  The Rib Eye Cap was excellent but a little too fatty for me.  The Kobe filet had to be one of the best steaks I've eaten!!!  The meat was well marbled and just melted in my mouth.  Surprisingly, they really don't kill you on the price either.  I've ordered Kobe steak at other restaurants before where I got a few morsels of steak and paid $300 for the steak.  I think I paid less than a quarter that at 5A5.

This place definitely has its lounge happening feel to it w/ the music going and the rounded booth seatings.  The customer service is superb.  I think we had about 4 different people serving us that night and the manager stopped by to say hi as well.  We each had a hamachi shooter which had avaocado, pea sprouts and ginger in a ponzu sauce.  Very tasty and fresh, but I ended up having to scoop it out of the shotglass with a spoon.  My bf had the 15 oz primb rib which he really liked.  I had the 6oz filet migeon which had a few sauces like the boursin cheese and demi-glace and a green sauce which matched pretty well. Although I love eating meat, I can't really just eat a whole steak normally, but since it was only 6oz, it was actually just the perfect size for me without me getting tired of it.   There's a larger size 10 oz for those who want more.  We also shared the truffle fries with the sriracha aioli which we both loved and could not stop eating.

It's also in the heart of happy hour, so well drinks and a few other beverage specials are only $5.00 a pop. We didn't have a full on dinner as we presumed that would be time consuming, and certainly rather pricey. We just had some starters-- all of which were excellent ,and quantity-wise quite abundant. The ribs and chips were great, the truffle fries were wonderfully starchy and comforting (although I sensed they were of the frozen variety as I stumbled on a lone rock solid piece, but I know this is common practice even in better restaurants), and the shishito peppers with bonito flakes achieved that perfect salty-spicy-greasy-fresh balance.

I think this site is a cursed location.  I know it has been a couple of places before it's current incarnation as 5A5.  You know it is a bad sign when you drive up to a restaurant and there is a sign in the window stumping for business by advertising happy hour specials.  The atmosphere is younger (late 20s-low 30s) which may explain why the bar/lounge area was busier than the restaurant area.  Wait service was good but the food was disappointing overall.  Hamachi shots were decent.  Not a lot of fish there for $4 a pop mostly extras in the shot glass and an overwhelming pozu sauce.  Shishito pepper bites were very tasty.  Lobster tempura may just be a bad idea.  Over frying delicate lobster not a good idea.  Sauce accompaniment was overly sweet.  Mizuna salad was great with the only exception being the crunchy topping added.  It left a slight rancid taste maybe do to old frying oil.  My wife had the 6 oz filet.  Asked for medium-rare it came out medium.  I had the bone-in rib-eye.  A big piece of meat perfectly cooked unfortunately the barbeque demi glaze was overly sweet and clouded the flavor of a nice rib-eye.  Sides were average at best.  Baby bok choy was overwhelmed by the overly smoky bacon.  Had to chew gum after that to get the smoke taste out of my mouth.  Mushrooms tasted like they were merely sauteed in oil.  Overall disappointing considering the top tier prices you pay.  If you're craving steak I'd recommend just about anywhere else.", "author": "Tony W."}

I started out in the lounge which is still cool but lacked the busy happy hour crowd so it was pretty subdued. I ordered a mojito and it was void of mint and tasted more like soda water.  I was laughing it with some friends so I did not want to sound like a complainer so I passed on letting the bartender know that his bartender education did not include a simple popular mojito. C'mon what is a mojito without mint? We order a few appetizers-fries, sliders, and sashimi. They were ok but prices were expensive. So after a couple hours, we went to the dining area. I got the aged strip and it was not very good. It was sort of dry without a lot of taste.  I should have trusted my gut when it was around 7PM and the dinner crowd was light. I could have made a better steak.  I think I will pass on this place in the future but I at least I can say that I tried it.", "author": "Caleb N."}
