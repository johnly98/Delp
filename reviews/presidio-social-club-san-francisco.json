We were actually seated right away outside in the nice patio area! \n\nNicole was our waiter and took great care of us.  Here's what I had:\n\nSIDE OF FRUIT - $6.50\nMy bowl had honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapples, strawberries, and blueberries. It was a decent portion but they were clearly not fresh fruits. You can tell by how withered up they were, like they've been in the fridge for some time now.  They were just okay.\n\nCHEDDAR BACON BISCUIT w/Maple Butter - $6\nOh this was a nice one.  There was enough butter for 5 biscuits. I really liked the sweet maple butter. The biscuit itself was nice and fluffy. \n\nMISSION-STYLE CHILAQUILES - $15.95\nScrambled Eggs, Tomatillo, Cotija Cheese.\nI'm surprised they left out the avocado in the menu description! Everything about this was delicious. I honestly ordered this because of the photos from Yelp. \n\nMy second time here was much better than the first.

I have eaten here many times and attended a friend's memorial in the private room where we were served excellent sliders and fries. \n\nMy last visit was for brunch 2 weeks ago. My husband had a very tasty chorizo, potato and tomato dish. I had the baked eggs in tomato sauce. \nMy dish was very bad. The eggs were done well, the yolk soft and creamy but the sauce was terrible. It had large almost inedible chunks of leeks that were difficult to chew and totally incompatible with the creamy eggs. The sauce was so bland. \n\nToday I made the same dish at home but used sliced red onions, small pieces of bell peppers, serrano peppers, fresh Roma tomatoes, garlic, touch of turmeric, ground cumin, smoked paprika and dried basil to make a delicious smooth sauce. \nPlease, please change your sauce. \nTurmeric is the spice du jour.", "author": "Nina D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-09", "description": "Funny how I wrote, \"I'll revisit this rating when the food gets better\" after my last visit. Well, that was over 11 years ago, and that was also my first visit. In the intervening years, friends had told me the food got better and the atmosphere got toned down from its former banana plantation vibe. So when I was thinking of a place to dine after an intimate wedding at the Palace of Fine Arts. This hit me since I knew parking would be a cinch and we could even walk over if we were so inclined. There were 11 of us, so I made a reservation a couple of days prior and they accommodated us with a long table smack dab in the middle (photo: http://bit.ly/2HGcXc1).\n\nThe menu was straight-ahead American reasonably priced but more elegantly executed than what I recalled. We shared a trio of appetizers, first with the $8 PSC Gruyere Cheese Toast with a tomato fondue dip (photo: http://bit.ly/2JHgEDF), a more upscale rendering of a long-ago after-school snack, and then with the irresistible $8 Deviled Eggs topped with white sturgeon caviar (photo: http://bit.ly/2sSk1xD). Deviled eggs are as foolproof a satisfier as you can get. The third share was the $7 Smashed Peas with mint oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2JGpUEH), a treatment of green peas I've never had before but to which I became instantly addicted. What a great risk-averse start to our post-wedding meal.\n\nJamie W. ordered the $32 Fish of the Day, which was a Grilled Swordfish which was accompanied by a fresh corn salsa and a ratatouille mix of mushrooms, spinach, and cherry tomatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/2t3FLpA). Delicious old-school seafood. I went a little healthier with the $21 Roasted & Grilled Spring Vegetables with Green Farro - carrots, asparagus, snap peas, and red onions mixed with a romesco sauce and topped with creme fraiche (photo: http://bit.ly/2JybrP9). It was more satisfying than a veggie dish has a right to be. As the rest of our party devoured protein-dominant fare like the meatloaf, grilled liver, and bavette steak, we considered our dessert options as it was that kind of celebration. Among all of us, we slammed four of the five specialty desserts.\n\nThe $10 Dark Chocolate Brownie was what you would hope, a generous hunk of rich goodness slathered in ganache and topped with a scoop of toasted almond ice cream and candied almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/2sQAbYu). The $9 slice of Lemon Meringue Cake was a classic smash-up of pie and cake school cafeteria-style (photo: http://bit.ly/2JBaE00), and the $9 PSC Butterscotch Pudding was of the same classic ilk with a dark chocolate sauce and cr\u00e8me Chantilly effortlessly replacing the Nestle and Reddi Wip (photo: http://bit.ly/2t2T0XM). The only marginal disappointment were the $9 Brioche Beignets which were chewier than I liked for fancy donuts even with the addition of a brown sugar hot chocolate for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/2JthMey). What a nice leisurely celebration with non-controversial dishes that fit the occasion.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...all-American dishes nicely rendered for immediate satisfaction\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...much brighter and whiter than when they first opened\nSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive even as the place started filling up\nTOTAL - 4 stars...\"I'll revisit the rating when the food gets better\"...check!", "author": "Ed U."}

We had really good desserts and left being a little upset, but not enough to write a poor review. \n\nAs we were driving to Ocean Beach my mom said we had to turn back because we had been charged incorrectly.

Two families, four kids and two cars in a city full of hipsters and privileged millennials. Well wouldn't you know it we were in exactly that situation. We called ahead to confirm and reserve the big table and headed to the Presidio Social Club. \n\nThe ambiance was great. There was plenty of parking, the fog had lifted, the Presidio grounds were amazing, the PSC patio was gorgeous and we had a great round white-tablecloth location by a big bright window in a room with other families. Yup - kids room - I don't mind when restaurants put us off to the side so long as the accommodations and service are equivalent. Service was fine. There isn't a kid menu, per se, but three of the kiddos split 2 \"classics\" mac n cheese orders at $13 a pop, the 4th had the $15 burger and all split a side of the $8 steamed broccoli, which was really broccolini. Nothing was cheap, but there were kid-friendly options. \n\nThe adult food was fine but unexceptional. We started with deviled eggs that we thought were average and under-seasoned except for what tasted like an explosion of celery salt. My entree was better - I had a $19 bucatini pasta dish with a diavolo sauce that I really enjoyed, although it was a bit one-note and it was sort of wanting for a protein addition. My wife tried to go light and had a similarly ok poke appetizer. Our adult friends had a kale salad with chicken, and a $19.50 meatloaf. \n\nThe shared desserts were a high point.

It's hard to screw up truffle fries, so those were fine, and the dipping sauces were great. The dessert (apple and pear strudel with cinnamon ice cream) was also flaky and delicious. Old fashioned was also fine.\n\nUnfortunately, the menu is sorely lacking vegetarian entrees (only two) so we settled on the spaghetti, and brussel sprouts on the side.\n\nThe spaghetti had virtually no flavor. A touch of olive oil and salt, maybe. The cauliflower might have been boiled. No seasoning that I could detect. This was one of the typical vegetarian dishes where the menu designer shrugs his/her shoulders and says, throw some spagetti in with an assortment of veggies, like pasta primavera. No thought to it and it tasted like it.\n\nThe brussels were wayyyy underroasted-and it's like chewing steak if they are that tough. Really, really hard. They should be lightly chewy. They were advertised as brussels with sage. I could detect no sage at all.  I had to re-heat both the leftover brussels and spaghetti with a spoonful of pesto, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic today for lunch to make it even decent.\n\nI would really advise the staff to check on their seasoning for these dishes, and think about another vegetarian entr\u00e9e or two.

We strolled in for lunch, first thoughts were \"This place is pretty swanky.\" White table cloths, attentive, very professional, timely service, great list of their favorite cocktails. Any place that leads a cocktail list with a gin French 75 knows what's up behind the bar. I had a French 75 and a couple of Old Cubans (basically a French 75 made with rum), they were great cocktails. The bar gets 5 stars. \nThe waitress, a Julia Stiles look alike, provided great service worth 5 stars! She was professional, timely, real people. \nSadly the food was fair at best. We started with the fois gras and chicken liver pate, definitely needed salt and pepper at least, and a new recipe at best. \nWe also had the deviled eggs with caviar. The caviar shined but again the deviled eggs needs seasoning of salt and pepper.  \nI had the lamb ragu pasta, which was pretty good after I heavily salted and peppered the dish. My lovely wife had a cheese burger with bacon and truffle fries. The bacon was the only star here. It sadly seams all the food that earlier needed salt didn't have it because it all ended up on her truffle fries.  The worst part of presentation was the tomatoes on the side, one of the slices was literally the tomato top where the stem attaches. Ruining the presentation of a $20 burger.\nGood thing a 5 star waitress, cocktail list, and the building's nostalgic value and ambiance bring the 2 star food up to a 3 star dining experience. \nI should also point out the cost rating should be changed from $$ to $$$ or $$$$. Two appetizers, 2 lunch entrees, and cocktails $150. Not complaining just not expected. \nWe salute the veterans of this fine country.

I have been to PSC many times over the years and with each passing year the quality of the food and regrettably the quality of the service declines. \n\nToday was another example of their lackluster approach to service. I planned a reservation at PSC x 1 month ago; informed them it was a birthday celebration and on arrival the host did lackadaisically acknowledge that it was someone's birthday and that was it. The server who clearly hated his job, never wished my child a happy birthday, acted annoyed to be at work the entire duration of our meal,  never once approached us to see how the meal was or asked if we needed anything. Did not offer any suggestions for the meal or suggest any specials. While this is not a high end restaurant, the price point is such that I would expect better service and have received better service there in the past.\n\nThis awful service might have been forgiven had the quality of the food served been stellar. Alas, it was not. Bland is the best adjective that I can use to describe our meal. If I have to season my food after it is delivered to me ina a restaurant, you have already failed as a chef! I have no idea why people keep patronizing this restaurant.  It is a ghost of the establishment it used to be and that is sad, because at one point PSC was terrific. Well today, you lost a patron. \n\nThankfully there are many establishments in SF to take your place. Service still counts PSC!

Unfortunately, none of the waiters that walked by I said hello or welcomed us to the restaurant. No big deal really it's just one of those things that I like.\n\nSticky table. The table was sticky. The table was perfectly clean it's just how old wood tables get sometimes they need to be sanded down and refinished. Again, not a really big deal just one of those things.\n\nThe burger is great. Very tasty high-quality meet on a wonderful bun. I'll get this again for sure.\n\nMoscow mule in glass? I ordered a Moscow mule because it seems like the thing to get to wash down a great burger but it came in a glass and not a copper mug. Once again, not really the biggest of deals but, it's just one of those things that I like.\n\nIce cream sandwich is a must get. It's big, it's tasty and it shareable. You've got to try this thing it's really good.\n\nOur server was great. Service here is on time and very friendly. That really matters to me. My water was always full.\n\nOverall I think this is a 3 1/2 star experience. Nothing bad but there's 1 million great restaurants in the city.", "author": "Justin S."}

We have come here with our baby at least 10 times but today a very rude woman named Marjorie made us feel terrible about needing to bring our infant in a stroller. Our baby is too small to sit up in a highchair so we purposely choose big restaurants with lots of room to accommodate he stroller. I even made the reservation for 3 just in case they were very full. (Our stroller tucks into the table taking up the same amount of floor space as a chair.) When we got there (at 10 am to a mostly empty restaurant) the hostess (Marjorie) gave us a disdainful look and asked twice if we really needed the stroller in a very rude tone. When we said we did she sighed and told the waiter to seat us. Just as we approached our table she came running after us and said that she had changed her mind and, in fact, our stroller was too big and they couldn't seat us except in the back of some weird side room. We've sat at that exact table with our baby in a stroller countless times without issue. The whole thing was really poorly handled and made us feel terrible. Needless to say we left and won't be back. It's a shame because it was one of our favorite restaurants!!

The food, a little hit and miss unfortunately. \n\nStarting with cocktails, I had the Ruger Mule consisting of vodka, cranberry liqueur, lime, and ginger beer.

Unfortunately, that's the best rating I can give my recent experience at Presidio Social Club. I used to really like this place. Not sure what happened.\n\nI came here with a friend/biz colleague for a 5pm happy hour. Since my friend lives in SF and I was coming from Marin, the Presidio was the perfect midway point for us to meet. Plus, they have plenty of free parking. But something about the whole experience left me cold. When I walked in, there was no host/hostess to greet me. The lighting in the place was very dark (so it felt like it was later than 5pm). My friend and I saddled up at the bar. It took over 10 minutes for a bartender to even acknowledge us. And keep in mind, there were only two other people at the bar. It was bizarre. I felt like we were wearing invisibility cloaks. When we finally caught a bartender's attention, we ordered a few cocktails. I opted for the Aged Negroni. $13 was a bit steep, especially during happy hour. But I will give them this, it really was a mighty fine beverage. I could've easily ordered another, but alas, I had to drive home.\n\nWe were a little hungry, so we decided to order a few bar snacks. We opted for the Truffle Fries, Deviled Eggs, and the Gruyere Cheese Toast with Tomato Fondue. These seemed like the easiest, quickest dishes to order on the menu. And yet our food must have taken 25-30 minutes to come out. \n\nSo how was the food? Well, it was just fine. The deviled eggs were tasty. But 4 tiny eggs for $8 seemed a tad pricy. They gave us a generous helping of truffle fries with an aioli and ketchup for dipping. I'll admit, I've never met a fry I didn't like. But these were a bit soggy and lacking any real crispiness. I'd say the biggest disappointment was the Gruyere Cheese Toast with Tomato Fondue dip (which really is a fancy way of saying grilled cheese sandwich with a side of tomato soup). For a grilled cheese toast, I was surprised by the lack of cheese. And the tomato soup for dipping was luke warm at best. \n\nAt no point did anyone come by to ask how our food was. We had to ask the bartender for water multiple times before he brought us anything. When the bill arrived, we owed $50 (not including tax or gratuity).\n\nSo there you have it. I want to like this place. And maybe it's better for dinner or brunch. But the over all vibe here was cold and unwelcoming. And I got the impression that these guys could care less if we ever came back or not. So it might be a while before I come back to give it another shot.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Not that it was a bad choice, I just wish I went with something unique or more adventurous. Especially because I can get eggs benny anywhere. To it's credit, the dish was wonderful and I ate every last bite. The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was a perfect companion to moisten the rest of the dish atop homemade English Muffins. Bellinis, yes please, I'll take another.\n\nThen there's the building itself. It feels like an old school '40s country club. Open, airy, crisp, with dark accents.

His response? This is the brunch menu. OMG! Now it was on! He  acted like a complete ass the rest of the time I was there. I asked him for the chicken and arugula salad with a different dressing on it then avocado dressing. I had to explain to him how I was allergic to avocado in order for him to understand I did not want the avocado dressing. When my friend ordered her sandwich I asked her what it was.

He never asked me or my friend if we want to drink refills, he never came by to see if our meals were OK, and he simply wanted us the hell out of there. It was very obvious from the minute we sat down. Not only will I not go to the Presidio Social Club again, but my friend who was new to the place, won't go back either. What a disappointment but the management should understand that the waiter is 90% of the experience. This waiter was the worst! He ensured I will not return and will let others know to go elsewhere.

Nothing like dining here for your company Holiday dinner and upon finishing your meal your coworkers spy a RAT!!! Yes a RAT inside the restaurant! The rat was looking for a Holiday drink as he scurried across the bar! For the prices that Presidio Social Club charges a rat does not make a good dinner companion ! Are you kidding me?!  Hire a exterminator!  \n\nWe made dinner reservations for four guests on the evening of Sunday December the 13th. My coworker and I arrived prior to our dinner reservation and had a cocktail at the bar while we waited for our coworkers to arrive. The place was busy with Holiday diners and the bar was busy as well. The cocktails were very good and we pursued the menu. \n\nShortly there after my coworkers arrived and we were seated promptly. We ordered some cocktails while we all looked over the menu. French 75, Moscow Mule, Old Cuban, and some wine were in order given it was a Holiday dinner. The cocktails were all very well prepared and were delicious!  \n\n\n We decided on several appetizers we had the oysters on the half shell, deviled eggs, and the PSC gruyere cheese toast with tomato fondue dip. All three appetizers were delicious and arrived in good time while we were still deciding what to order for the main course.\n\nWhen it came down to ordering the main courses they were out of the special fried chicken. But they had the roasted chicken?! We has a awkward exchange with the waitperson while he tried to explain why they had the roasted chicken but not the fried chicken that was on special. \n\nWe all ordered our main dishes my coworker and I decided to split the order of oven roasted ribeye steak for two, while my other two dinner companions chose the herb roasted half chicken. We also decided on a side of Macaroni and cheese as well as the roasted brussels sprouts. The main dishes were very good and had great portions as well as presented beautifully. \n\nWho doesn't have room for dessert? We chose PSC Cookie Plate as well as the Brioche Beignets that came with a brown sugar hot chocolate for dipping the warm Beignets a very nice touch! \n\nThe service as attentive but not flawless as the awkward exchange about the chicken. And our party felt that we were being rushed out which is not a good feeling given that it was a Holiday gathering and they were in no urgent need for our table as it was later in the evening and no one was waiting for the said table. \n\nBut while everything was as good as it was and the service while a little lacking but still ok the topper of the night was the unwelcome dinner companion! The RAT! Maybe that is why the staff wanted us out because the restaurant was growing quiet and they did not want us to see what comes out! Either way that is why I gave it a one star review. \n\nIn hindsight I wish we would have mentioned something to the staff but we were being rushed out and after seeing the rat running across the bar we were more than ready to make our exits! Please staff at Presidio Social Club if you do read this please take care of the issue IMMEDIATELY!\n\n I understand that you host many events including weddings I being a bridal consultant have had brides getting married at your location and I do not know what to say when asked what my thoughts are on your dining establishment.

Many of the Dutch paintings featured people drinking beer and eating oysters and it made our mouth's water. My friend suggested Presidio Social Club as a place to get oysters -- over Hog Island which would have been closed by the time we got there. \n\nNow, I love the Presidio and it's pretty hard to beat as a location so if this place was anywhere else, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. It's a great historic building with a fantastic view of the bustling Presidio and ILM buildings. The decor is spectacular and really does feel like an old social club. Our waiter was not only gorgeous but fabulously friendly and attentive, albeit young and not terribly informed about where our $3 oysters were from. Turns out the \"Northwest\" oysters are from Orcas Island. The oysters were very good and nicely presented.\n\nWe decided to get a variety of nibbles from the appetizer menu and share everything. We got a butter lettuce salad, kale salad, french fries, a dozen oysters and a prosciutto/cheese plate. The kale salad was probably the best thing, followed by the french fries. The butter lettuce was yummy but it's so unsubstantial, it's like eating air. The prosciutto/cheese plate was a disappointment. Just thin slices laying on a plate with nothing to eat it with, no fruit, no bread, no condiments. And really only a few ounces of food. \n\nThe beer selection was pretty sparse, after all my mouth watering this was a disappointment. It seems like this is more of a cocktail joint. The wine list was alright and my friend found a good one. We polished the plates and then ordered fritters and one of us got coffee. The beignets were okay, nice texture but not particularly delicious, but the chocolate sauce was to die for. I drank the rest of it which was like a thick mexican hot chocolate. Yum!\n\nAll in all, we spent about $50 per person and walked away not exactly hungry but not exactly satisfied either.

Lighting was romantic and perfect for the occasion.\n\nI'm trying not to be too critical about the dishes served bc I know it was mass produced for the wedding.

The waiters came and took our orders right before service. I had the swordfish and my date had the braised short ribs. It actually turned out to be a lot of food and we were pretty stuffed. The salad was good...nothing too special. The swordfish was a little dry maybe bc it was precooked. Braised short ribs were tender but also a little dry. Good thing there was gravy. \n\nHere go the cons - Food preparation was inconsistent. At our table, one of the salads had no sesame seeds....while everyone elses' salad had them. One of my friends' short ribs had no gravy at all. I guess those were oversights since it was a wedding. However, I don't think that should be an excuse.

Presidio Social Club doesn't deserve my time as I already wasted 2.5 hours last night (painstakingly slow and inattentive service) and $80 per person for the WORST foie gras I've ever had in my life.\n\nBeing the only restaurant in San Francisco and quite possibly in California that still serves foie gras after the statewide ban (7.1.12), I'll give Presidio Social Club props for finding a loophole to continue serving foie gras (on Federal land and not subject to ban). Not only has Presidio Social Club gained national attention, it has sent a flurry of foie gras lovers  to their doors so they can continue getting their fix.\n\nWhat I do NOT give them props is for milking it for all its worth and then some. For an additional $18, you have the option to add foie gras to your entree. There's only two entrees on the menu which the foie gras would work with, the steak bavette ($26) or ribeye for two ($68). We opted for the ribeye which to our dismay arrived topped with foie gras torchon (not seared foie gras as you would expect). Picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/U1nNL9ur-0RO7gROm9PpOw?select=taTNKc8U8YzqbWoJnEs-wg#LH9ouGM_dVh15o4bwuAq8w  \n\nFoie gras torchon is meant to be served as an appetizer with bread and a fruity acidic component and NOT served atop a steak. For $18 a piece, we got a disk of foie gras torchon that was disgustingly salty. To add salt to the wound (literally), it was topped with MORE salt. Like slimy snots, sinew within the torchon made it even viler that none of us could stomach finishing it (and you know how much I love my foie gras).\n\nThe other dishes we ordered weren't any better as they were poorly executed (my friend got food poisoning from the mussels) and presentation for some of our dishes were reminiscent to food served to senior citizens at a convalescent home (I wish I took pictures of the smashed peas and mashed potatoes).\n\nI know Chef Tang is not classically trained in French cuisine but it's an insult to this French delicacy to not take the time to learn how to properly prepare it and even worse, serve it and charge an absurd amount for complete crap. \n\nGREEDY MUCH?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Please, stop serving foie. \nI read the glowing reviews here and noticed they're all 3+ years old. This place must have been good at one point but has seriously gone DOWNHILL and in a last ditch attempt, they are revitalizing themselves by capitalizing the fact that they're on federal land and serving foie.\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nIF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PREP IT, DON'T SERVE IT. Go read foie for dummies or something! \n\nWhen the meal first started I was thinking, \"yea , this place is so so. I would probably give it 3 stars\" but as the meal progressed, the lower my rating sunk.\n\nOur waiter didn't bother to give us the special menu, we had to inquire about that.. I also had to inquire about the fish of the day. BTW, this foie slider that they are serving is poached foie w/ pineapple. \n\nStarted off with the chicken liver pate and pan roasted mussels in cioppino broth. \nThe chicken liver pate was good. Loved the cornichons as well but that was it. My friends had arrived before me and they had plates. I was missing plates for a good while.  This was when I was thinking PSC is so so. \n Don't order the mussels. For the love of seafood, do not claim it's a cioppino broth. Just because you toss in half a tomato the last couple of minutes does not make it a cioppino broth.Cioppino broth is aromatic and flavorful whilst the one at PSC is not. It was bland bland bland bland BLAND. They also didn't bring us a bowl for our shells until we were nearly halfway done with the dish. Not to ention the onions were not even thoroughly cooked?? \n\n\nGot the rib eye and added 3 orders of foie. For our sides, we had the mashed potatoes, peas with mint oil and an order of the mac & cheese. When our entree arrived, we were sorely disappointed. It's just a torchon of foie but the torchon slathered with tons of salt. The rib eye itself was flavorless (how sad) and the foie was overly salty. It tasted better when you had a bite of both but I started feeling sick. This is when it went downhill for me. I got dizzy and lightheaded. At first I was thinking it was too much salt for me. I excused myself and headed to the restroom where I proceeded to upchuck 4x.\n\nI can't say much for the peas, mashed potatoes and mac & cheese although my friend did say the peas looked like convalescent home food.\n\nThe rest of the night, I felt terrible. I was praying on the porcelain throne well until 1am. It was probably the mussels.\n\nI was so dissatisfied with the foie torchon on my rib eye that I cannot even fathom that poached foie slider *shudders*\nI took the leftover rib eye home thinking my brother would eat it. I texted him to tell him I had some food for him and he thanked me. I woke up this morning and it was still sitting on the kitchen table barely 1/4 eaten. He said it was flavorless.\n\nI'd rather be hungover in a 3rd world country.", "author": "Susy C."}

This wasn't interesting spicy, it was like fireball candy (or whiskey) in the back of your throat spicy. Not even that it was too hot, but whatever the red cinnamon stuff they used in that drink overwhelmed my mouth completely. Later, wine suggestion did not go well with either my mouth or the food or both. Waiter wasn't really engaging us in our questions either.\n\nHowever, the food was the highlight of the meal. We started out with some oysters (nice and clean) and grilled cheese toasts (good but pretty small portion).

The look and feel of the place, and the location are all very nice. But the food is just okay and a little over-priced for what it is. My $32 pork chop was certainly big and impressive. And the saut\u00e9ed corn it was sitting on was very good, but the chop itself was dry and tasteless. The others at our table had the same kinds of reactions to their food. Okay, but nothing special.\n\nThe real problem though is the service, and especially the officious hostess and reservation staff. I made my reservation via Open Table. Then I got a call from the restaurant asking to confirm. Fine. I confirmed. Then a couple days later I got another message asking for another confirmation. I ignored this one figuring that Open Table and one confirmation should be enough. Then, I got another message saying if I didn't confirm they couldn't guarantee my reservation. So, I called again.\n\nThen, when five of us arrived on time for our table for six we were told that we would all have to wait to be seated until our sixth person who was stuck in Bay Bridge arrived.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-30", "description": "Came here for date night with the honey. First, this place gets top ratings just due the fact that it has a parking lot!! Yes, you heard it right, free and easy PARKING!! And not just a 3-4 car dinky little lot, but it has at least 20-25 spots!! I thought I died and went to suburban heaven. And on a completely unrelated note, even for the Marina/Presidio, this place is extremely white (not that there's anything wrong with that). I have never seen so many blondes (fake or otherwise) in my life.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, we agonized between sharing the pork chops and burger or get the steak for two. In the end, we decided to hedge and error on the side of variety. We also ordered the chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 to start, a Moscow mule for me and Makers on the rocks for the boy. We held hands and dreamily locked peepers over the flickering candle night -- another romantic date night was about to commence. Not sure if it was the booze or the dim light, but hot damn, the boyfriend looked good!\n\nFirst up, the p\u00e2t\u00e9. It had a nice layer of fat on top, which my boyfriend (not so) surreptitiously scrapped off and dug in for the pink stuff. I didn't mind the fat; more flavor for me. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 was smooth and didn't taste organ-y at all; paired with the fig (?) jam, me likey! The toast points that came with the dish could use a bit more refinement, they were essentially whole wheat bread cut into sticks. I think a fancier, more toasted bread would be preferable. Nevertheless, it was a great start to the meal.\n\nAfter we sufficiently mopped up every last morsel of the p\u00e2t\u00e9, our entrees promptly arrived. I got the burger first and Orin the pork chops. The patty of the burger was chubby and thick, almost like a meatball. We requested it medium rare and the kitchen delivered. The center was nicely pink. Although not the most juicy or flavorful burger that I've tried, the fact that the patty was so compact made the mouth feel seem more succulent than it was. I say that because there were no run-off from the burger at all. Maybe it was because they rested the patty? Although, do people really rest hamburger meat? The thin cut fries were crispy and paired with the garlic aioli, pretty much spud heaven. I would give the burger a B+.\n\nThe pork chop, on the other hand, was a lackluster. I told our waitress that I prefer the pork less done, if possible. The meat was pretty tough and dry, especially the parts that were further away from the bone. It was seasoned well, though. The greens provided some needed moisture to the dish, but it was on the salty side. The apple sauce balanced it out a bit, but the chop itself was simply too overcooked to salvage the dish. In my book, that's a C-.\n\nI read in other yelp reviews that the banana cream pie was the star of the dessert menu, however, I was informed that the restaurant has a new pastry chef and they no longer make the pie. It's nice to know that the place makes desserts in-house, but I had my mind set on the banana cream pie so didn't end up ordering anything. Next time, I'll be sure to save room for sweets.", "author": "Alice W."}

My friend and I shared the rib eye for two as it's called but let me jump back to the appetizers.\n\nWe ordered the spinach dip. It was small and not nearly enough for a table of three. The toast it came with was done in a minute and we had to order regular bread which simply didn't work with the dip. The server didn't seem to get that. Tip to restaurant: the server should let a table of three know that it's small and maybe order two or simply bring us more of the toast it came with... or make it larger.\n\nNow, back to the rib eye. It was perfectly cooked. It was a nice piece of meat. I have two complaints: 1) Cooked with WAY too much salt. 2) It must have been two pounds of fries just dumped on top covering the meat, adding more salt taste and grease to the meat. Not to be picky but I didn't like fishing around a pile of french fries to get the meat. It's too casual and burger joint like.\n\nThese are just my comments - you may like your food prepared differently and find the Presidio Social Club to your liking as it has a lot to offer.

I had steak tartar or something bloody and nobody cleared my plate.  So I sat there staring at the bloody remnants.  I wanted another glass of wine but could not get anyone's attention.\n\nSo I wrote PSC off until a neighbor said i should give it a 2nd chance.  So I went for lunch and had the liver.

My only complaint is that there were a ton of kids running around while they're parents were enjoying a lovely brunch a well, so it got a bit noisy.

At first I was confused there was not a larger sign for this restaurant but then I realized its most likely to preserve the historical quality of the area and building.

Everytime we would pass the Social Club, we would hear the buzz of happy campers filling the air.  We noticed that it is always open and usually full.  We made reservations for that evening, and were ushered to a table along the middle of the room.  It is the old Teen Club that served the Presidio when it was an Army base.  (One of the reasons we love to stay here, is my beau lived here when his Dad was stationed at the base in the Army)  We get a nostalgia vibe as well as admiring the beautiful militaryesque updates in all the buildings. \nWe ordered a lemonade and a Cadillac Margarita, and I chose the Filet of Sole Special with roasted brussels sprouts.  The drink fortified me, and the festive, club-like atmosphere of the place relaxed me.  My pal got a perfectly cooked burger, with the most delicious truffle fries!

It is near where my daughter lives, and the parking is easy. I very much like the old building and the atmosphere it creates.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend this place. Here's why.\n\nLoud. Others have mentioned this, but because of the extensive amount of glass coupled with hardwood ceilings, the noise gets very concentrated. It is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation.\n\nLousy service. This last dinner was the worst. It took fifteen minutes before we ordered, and there were other long 10-15 minute gaps in service. It was some of the slowest, least attentive dining experiences I've had in years. Really bad. This was true, to a lesser degree, during my previous two visits (both in the past eighteen months).\n\nAverage food. We had thirteen people in our group, and to one degree or another, each one had similar reactions all of which can be summed up as: meh. I had the swordfish special and it was a very average piece of fish, overcooked, served over some sort of sauerkraut. It was OK, but for the price ...\n\nHigh prices. I paid the bill for all three meals I've had at this place, and on the first two occasions was blown away by how high-priced the final tab was. This time we had two children and, because of the lousy service, did not have appetizers or dessert (dinner still took two and a half hours!). As a result, it was $575 for thirteen people, which is not too bad for San Francisco. The last time I was there it was almost the same amount for six people, which is closer to what I think you will pay if you have 1-2 drinks, one appetizer, and dessert.\n\nThis is a place that, with the right management, some changes in the interior to make it quieter, and a decent chef, could be a really special place. I hope these changes get made some day.", "author": "John M."}

The chef's pasta special was a good choice. Their drink menu seems well refined with classic cocktails. I went with the Aged Reasons Rye. It tastes like a Manhattan with a hint of burnt orange. Fans of whisky will find a solid stock of rye here as well.\n\nService here is world class. JL was our server and provided service unlike anything I've had in SF. He was a playful, polite, articulate older gentleman that described each plate in the most minute detail. The style in which he took care of the table that of an experienced craftsman.

I LOVE Dungeness crab, and the pasta was the perfect portion size, and I liked the spiciness of it. \nMy husband had the burger and fries, which was outstanding. His burger was cooked perfectly, (which rarely happens) and his fries were awesome. I admit i stole a few. He also had a bowl of the soup of the day, and it was delicious.\n\nTheir version of a Moscow Mule was a bad one, bland, and not nearly gingery enough.\nAlthough, I LOVED the pisco punch,and my husband did like his drinks.\n\nWe shared the pineapple upside down cake , which came with a wonderful toffee sauce. It was smaller than some of the other desserts we saw coming out, but the perfect size for us, (along with the ice cream.)

The ice cream sandwich with candied nuts and perfectly blackened marshmallows was off the charts delicious -- a rare upscale improvement on such a childhood classic. The beignets with a vanilla dipping sauce also impressed.\n\nLastly, our server was on point and the location in the heart of the Presidio couldn't be better.

It didn't add much, if anything it made it less appealing. Also the rye toasts could have been nicer quality bread, toasted longer, and maybe buttered. As it stood, I was reminded a bit too much of rye wonder bread... I would have rather seen a little pot of sea salt and coarse ground pepper and crispy fresh baguette toasts to go with the patte. \n\nEast/West Chicken Noodle Soup-- \nThis soup is definitely on the tangy, lemon chicken side. I enjoyed the little star shaped pasta immensely! I do wish there had been a little more substance and less broth, but overall quite tasty. \n\nService jumped up a notch when the server said that they would like to offer us a dessert on the house. SWEET! Must be that irresistible Susan charm at work again. \n\nBeingets with shot of Mexican Hot Cocoa-- \nThis was the highlight of the meal. Hot, perfectly friend dough sprinkled with sugar. It was delectable dipped in the cocoa that was rich, with just the right creaminess and spice. NUMMY! \n\nOverall I think the price point is a little high. Improving the little details of the dishes would equate to a much more balanced experience. I think that they are trying to maintain a homey feeling to upscale dining but I think they should choose to actually hit the upscale quality or lower prices to a more home-meal type price point. \n\nNever the less I enjoyed my meal and would be interested in trying other dishes.", "author": "Susan C."}

We also split an order of mac n cheese with the table. The meatloaf was a nice portion, but easily forgettable. It seemed a bit dry and lacked flavor. To be honest, I would equate this to the Cheesecake factory meatloaf. The hamburger, for the price did not cut it for me. Not when you have Roam and Umami less than a mile away. The truffle fries were definitely the best part of the meal for me. Crispy with Parmesan and that signature truffle taste. Mac n cheese was good, not excellent though. Just no wow factor for me. \n\nDessert allowed Presidio Social Club redeem themselves a bit with beignets. these were absolutely delicious, large and pillow soft. \n\nOverall, this place is definitely worth checking out for the atmosphere.

We didn't have reservations but got there right at 10 and had no problem getting a table. The beignets alone are worth the visit! \n\nLocation:  This restaurant is located in the Presidio, one of my favorite places to escape the noise of city living. Parking is easy and accessible which makes this location a prime spot for weekend brunch goers. \n\nFood: The first thing we noticed was how poorly the brunch menu was organized. Seriously, don't look at the headers of the sections read each item. It was like someone just randomly placed each menu item on a piece of paper, shuffled them around, and was like \"looks good enough.\" Anyways, once we had navigated through the menu we ordered the beignets. The beignets are INCREDIBLE! So much so, that we ordered a second round for the table. They are absolutely delicious and while writing this I am considering heading there now for the beignets. \n\nI also ordered the Mission-style chilaquiles (scrambled eggs, tomatillo, cotija cheese) which was too saucy in my opinion. The tastes blended together quickly and after about 5 bites I felt like I was just eating straight sauce and became uninterested in eating anymore. I would not order this again. I would however, order a third round of beignets and call that a solid meal. :)\n\nAtmosphere: I loved the atmosphere here! It is a surprisingly large space and offers indoor dining, bar seating, and an outdoor patio (which I believe is pet-friendly). The restaurant decor is industrial chic and there are red accents throughout adding a nice pop of color. We all noticed and admired the neat light fixtures in the main room.\n\nService: The service was friendly and helped us navigate the poorly designed brunch menu. The food did take a long time to be served, but I think that was a kitchen issue not server related. \n\nOverall: I give this a low 4 overall. I would go back for the beignets without a doubt!

Back then, during the heady Dotcom boom days, PSC was a wall-to-wall vortex of libations and great times. \n\nSo when I heard that PSC was \"working\" a loop hole in the pathetic, completely asinine Foie Gras ban, it was a terrific excuse to gather some friends and head on over to sinfully indulge in one of my favorite and exquisite guilty pleasures. \n\nYou see, there's something even more tempting about Foie now that it is illegal.   It's now the forbidden fruit, or should I say the forbidden offal. \n\nAnd I was hoping there would be protesters.....\n\nI arrived a bit early to secure table.     They had Talisker on the drink menu.    Curses!  ...my favorite brand.    I guess this is not the week to stop drinking scotch.    At $15 a pop, it was the most expensive pour on the menu, but what the hell, life is once. \n\nOtra friend arrived, and we started with some apps....effective foreplay for the foie main event.    Smoked Almonds, Deviled Eggs; both delightful.   The eggs were petite and fresh, with just the right amount of mustard finish.   Very nice.     We also had the Gruyere Toast, which was a bit too spongy and puffy for my tastes, but the gruyere and slight mustard hints were just right.  \n\nAnd then, dear readers, it was time.  \n\nApparently they took some of the recent negative Yelp reviews to heed (they last served it as a torchon on steak which received mixed and poor reviews).  This weekend they served the Foie (which is surreptitiously NOT on the menu ;) and seared with lingonberry reduction and brioche toast....my absolute FAVORITE presentation.   Were they reading my mind?     It was heavenly (albeit smallish), perfectly seared...just right.    I ordered twice.   Cut with a wonderful Guy Sabet Savignon Blanc, it had me walking on the clouds.\n\nThen steak entree which was nice, but not mind-boggling.     Just good, meat and potatoes fare.  \n\nFor desert we had chocolate filled beignets which were outstanding.    I only had one (sugar in moderation); but they smashing - served with a white-chocolate sauce on the side which made it perfect.  \n\nPresidio Social Club is a wonderfully converted Army Barracks, tastefully appointed with sleek furniture and FOH accoutrement that reflect 30's and 40's style which I love.    It feels like an Officer's Club gone retro in the 21st Century...a unique experience.  \n\nService was a tad on the slow side, hence the loss of a star, but not annoyingly so.  \n\nProtesters be damned...I'll be back again soon to delight in my beloved (and now illegal) foie.", "author": "Max K."}

We'd called in advance to ask, before making the reservation, if we could bring in our own special dessert. The hostess said, \"As long as it's not a cake, you're fine. Go ahead; it won't be a problem.\" When we got there, we were told that we would be charged $3/person for any dessert we brought. We asked to speak with the manager, who told us their practice is to charge $2/cupcake. Clearly, they don't have their requirements straight. I said that we'd asked in advance, and they said, too bad in an unfriendly, abrasive way. Go somewhere with a more varied, better menu and a customer-service-oriented staff.", "author": "Mitch B."}

That pretty much sums up the symphony of cacophony in this place.  From 6 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. on a Thursday night it was packed and LOUD.  Apparently these old military buildings aren't much in the way of good acoustics and nothing appears to have been done to solve that problem when it came time to turn the place into a bar/restaurant.  \n\nAbove the clamor I enjoyed $1 oysters (Thursday nights, from 4 - 7 p.m.).  Perhaps this is why everyone is so loud and happy?  Served on a bed of crushed ice with a spicy mignonette, the small oysters went down with cool ease.  They were wonderful and finally at a price I can stomach.\n\nI also enjoyed a perfectly delicious burger ($12) with good - but not world-class  - fries, and washed it all down with a chilly martini.  I liked this place, with it's great location just inside the Presidio gate, free and ample parking, and spirited crowd.

Planning a wedding is stressful enough as it is, and working with a restaurant was great.  Their event planner, Gail, was wonderful, and was quick to answer emails and to get back to my husband and I on all of our questions and she was extremely detailed.  Working with a restaurant is wonderful because you don't have to work about outside catering, or getting tables/chairs/linens/etc.  We did have to order plates because their plates didn't match and some had red stripes on them.  But that was pretty much our biggest issue with this PSC.  They took care of ordering everything and Gail simply gave me options of what type of plates I wanted and she took care of the rest.\n\nWe also had three specialty cocktails made for our reception, an aviation, a manhattan, and a twist on a french 75 and they were fantastic.  Our guests enjoyed them (some enjoyed them a little too much, but hey, it's a wedding right?!).  The food was wonderful, we had prime rib and chicken, along with a great kale salad (if this is on their normal menu, you should definitely order it... what san francisco girl doesn't love a good kale salad?) and the gruyere grilled cheese for appetizers.  For desert we had fleur de sel cookies and beignets filled with chocolate.  Every step of the way Gail and the rest of the team at PSC worked to create what we wanted for our event... something that was classy, but a little whimsical and fun.  We even had french fry cones brought out for our guests towards the end of the night.  \n\nIt was a wonderful experience, and we wouldn't have changed a single thing about our wedding.  If you are thinking about using this restaurant as a reception venue, or for any sort of party, I completely recommend it!", "author": "Brooke S."}

I have always admired the restaurant from afar, but this was my fist time inside. Equally as adorable on the inside as out.\n\nWe started our meal with the butternut squash and burratta appetizer (yum), and an order of truffle fries. Could not determine what the second dipping situation for the fries was (\"I mean, it wouldn't be JUST mayo.\" \"Maybe it's an aoli?\" \"Do you think it's ranch?\" \"Isn't aoli basically just fancy mayo?\"), but regardless, all was delicious.\n\nOf the six of us, 5 ordered the mac n cheese since we decided we would be too jealous of the others. #6 got the tuna poke. Everyone was pleased and pleasantly full.\n\nI had picked up some cupcakes earlier in the day for us to have as a dessert. Note that there is a $2 per person fee for desserts if you bring in your own. i haven't done a cost analysis, but I feel like it was probably worth it since we ended up with cupcakes.\n\nI hear that PSC has an excellent brunch, too, so I will be back to try that.

My boyfriend is not a breakfast/brunch food fan, and the fact they only offer the breakfast/brunch menu all day left him with basically only one entree option to choose from, which was the PSC Burger.

Our waiter ended up being a nice guy and the food came out within a reasonable amount of time though. Minus one star.\n\nWe had: \n\nPSC Burger with fries - it was honestly an ok burger. We have definitely had better burgers elsewhere (Umami and Gourmet Burger Kitchen come to mind). It was awfully small for the price, and not very flavorful. The bun was a miss. Fries were good though, as were the pickled onions that were served with the burger. Would not order again. \n\nBaked Mac n Cheese - OMG cheese! This was actually, in all honesty, one the top 3 Mac n Cheese meals that I've ever had. The cheese sauce was the PERFECT consistency, full of flavor. 5 stars!! Would come back to PSC just for this. \n\nPork Belly - very good! A tad tougher than I like my pork belly...but still delicious. Fatty, salty, and full of flavor, the pork belly was excellent with the mac n cheese. \n\nOysters on the half - I mean how can you go wrong with oysters on the half?

My sister was visiting from Italy and I thought this would be a great place to stop. Last week we stopped in about 4:30 pm, were seated and given the bar and drink menus. We order Apenzel Spritzes. I asked our waiter, who seemed very preoccupied, when the dinner menu would be available to which he said about an hour or so. Ok.  About 10 minutes later, a family was seated near us and I noticed they were given dinner menus. We would have gladly waited 10 minutes. We had not yet ordered but thought we would not say anything.  In the meantime, a bus boy was sweeping on the other side of our area raising dust. He then comes next to our table and begins sweeping raising a lot of dust and I asked him if he could please not do that now. My sister was sneezing. He walked away without saying a word. If they needed to clean this area, they should have seated us in another area. \n\nWe ordered and my sister ordered a big salad and asked if she could have some bread with her meal. The food came and we again asked our waiter who seemed bothered by the fact that he was dealing with us about the bread. He went to the kitchen and came back and said that there was no bread available right now, as they were baking the bread for dinner. I asked him how long and he said about 10 minutes. OK fine.  About 45 minutes later, a young women came over and asked if everything was ok. I asked about the bread, she went to the kitchen and returned with a basket of bread. It was not warm, so I knew it was not freshly baked for dinner. This server could not have been nicer or more attentive, so I have only praise for her.  \n\nI assume the other waiter had finished his shift. If he did not want to serve us, he should have told his supervisor that he was ending his shift and would prefer not to take a table.

Seated at the bar I thought I could get a good view of their whiskey selection and check out the bartender's mixing style. I was intrigued by the lauded \"barrel aged\" liquor they served. I was a little underwhelmed. Perhaps the younger man behind the bar was a little new- forgot to add ice as he mixed up my bourbon sour and with egg white I thought he maybe he's going to hand froth it. No worries, his older bar companion reminded him of the key ingredient. Simple mistake, easily forgiven. However as he placed the finishing garnish of a lemon slice on the rim, his fingers dipped into the froth on the top of the drink... I know he knows I saw this. Yet, he served it up, no qualms. I wasn't bold enough to ask for another drink, but it did turn me off from the drink. I know he was rearranging the menus before he made that drink and he certainly didn't wash his hands. I know, there must be a lot of that going on at a lot of bars on busy nights but I was a little surprised - given both the stature of this establishment and the slow pace (the next drink he made was an experiment for himself and a few more drinks for the serving staff). I'm sure you could get away with it if your customer was seated at a table far away, but its a little disconcerting when he's dipping his finger in your drink right in front of you. Nervous or not, I was disappointed. \nThe aged reasons rye was tasty, but not complex. The bartender however was successful at igniting the orange peel correctly. Granted, they did have a fair selection of whiskeys, Russells, Four roses, Knob, Hudson. But nothing extensive. I appreciate that they carried Hanger One vodka, perhaps they should try out St George's Breaking and entering Bourbon. \nOn to the food, just ordered a few side dishes. The roasted beets were delicious. The asparagus had a great relish with capers, red onions and a lemon vinaigrette. The chicken pate was tasty but average and the \"toasts\" or slices of toasted bread was a little awkward. For dessert, the beignets were a little big and not light, however the mexican chocolate sauce that accompanied them was quite tasty. With all that dining and sitting so close to the bar, you would think they would do a better job refilling water glasses.", "author": "Naomi K."}

It started with the hostess lying to me about my reservation.  I had specifically requested a round table.  She told me that it was no problem at all.  In fact, we had a lengthy conversation about how my mother has a thing for round tables, and she kept saying how happy she was that they could provide one.   When we arrived, the man who greeted us told us that we could not have a round table.  He said it quite rudely.  When I mentioned what I was told above, a young woman said, oh, i'm the one who took your reservation, and all i told you was that we would do our best.  This was a total lie!!  And, there had been a private party booked a long time ago that they had committed all of their round tables to.  \nThat was just the beginning...\nWe were finally seated, and then waited over 15 minutes for a server to come.   My father ordered two bottles of wine, and we said that we weren't going to order cocktails, so that we would like one of them right away.  Again, no server......I finally flagged down a busser to get our server.  He then brought over both bottles of white at the same time, poured my father a taste, then realized that half of the table didn't even have wine glasses.   He came back with glasses and poured for everyone, EXCEPT my father, who had ordered the wine!!!\nIt just got worse and worse.   During our entire meal, I had to flag down bussers, because our waiter disappeared.  And NO, the restaurant was not busy.  Furthermore, the food was horrible.

Came for brunch with a group of 6 and there was a group of 14 before us, a group of 6 after us, and another group of 4 after them. There were tables connected for the group of 14, however it was currently occupied. There were 3 available tables of 6 behind the occupied table. So since the tables for 6 were empty you would think they would seat us. However, the hostesses were waiting for the big party to leave so they could seat the 14, but wanted to keep the 3 tables open just in case the big party didn't leave anytime soon. Which they didn't. Yet the hostesses still didn't combine the 3 tables to seat the 14 and still wouldn't seat us because the 14 hasn't been seated. So basically there were 18 available seats and 30 people waiting to be sat and 0 people actually sitting. This continued for 50 minutes as the big party never left so the 14 people could not be seated and so on. Luckily the bar is huge and could accompany 30 people quite comfortably. So finally after 50 mins and the hostesses decide to seat us and the other two groups behind us, while the group of 14 are still waiting. Therefore, it made no sense to make the other groups wait??!\n\nAnyways, our waiter was new and annoying and spilt water all over.

I sat at the bar after a long day walking all over the city and both the dungeness crabcake sliders and the house Manhattan, 100 Reason Rye, were very good. Recently I needed to find a restaurant for a large group at the last minute after a visit to the nearby Exploratorium and was thrilled they could seat us immediately with almost no notice for dinner. \n\nSeating is one thing, serving is another. My number one restaurant pet peeve is when there is a long delay taking your order. Everything falls apart from there. Once our drink order was taken, our server essentially disappeared for about half an hour. I'm not shy, so I have no problem flagging someone down, but that wasn't even an option. \n\nOnce our order was taken, the rest of the service was fine with a few other odd moments here and there. We ordered a wide variety of food and it was hit-or-miss. I ordered the meatloaf from their Classics menu and it was a disappointment. The mashed potatoes in particular were not very good. From the antipasti menu, the pesto carrots were probably the most interesting item and the daily special, a crab bake, looked very good.\n\nSince I'm so fond of The Presidio and want to explore it further on future visits, I would probably return for that casual drink at the bar so I can pretend I'm Kelly McGillis about to be serenaded by Maverick and Goose.

The marinara while very flavorful, overwhelmed the mild burrata.  Tuna poke was over flavored with sesame and fish was a bit on the chunky side with a few pieces chewy and stringy.  Wife had the black cod special and while described as baked, seemed almost poached and over cooked to the point of mush.  Served on a bed of mashed leeks the only part of the dish that had much of any texture were the green peas on top.\nI had the liver and onions and to be fair, I hadn't ordered that at a restaurant in quite a few years, I asked for it to be medium and what I got was more than half the cut a mushy rare (blah).  Since it was sliced and sunk into mashed potatoes it didn't seem worth the effort to send it back. \n140$ not including tip doesn't add up to 2 cocktails, 2 glasses wine, 2 mediocre apps and 2 mushy entrees.\n2 stars food\n4 stars service \nWe'll be back for brunch, but not dinner I'm afraid.", "author": "Walt L."}

Overall, it was a delightful, experience (though at around $60/person after all was said and done, I'm not entirely certain I couldn't have had better, if you'll forgive the double-negative).\n\nThe foie gras -- which does not appear to be on the menu but is available if you ask for it (PSC is technically not in California due to federal land rules, so they can serve FG) was, of course, amazing -- seared, with some jam that contrasted beautifully with the rich texture of the foie gras.  As the only place, I think, to regularly serve it in the area, it's a must-visit if only for that.\n\nThe deviled eggs with caviar were pretty damn good, and super-delicious, though a little more caviar on them probably would have made more of an impression on a dish that mostly tasted like ... well, deviled egg with a hint of caviar.  I wanted to be slapped in the face by the caviar, and that didn't happen.\n\nMy wife had the parts of whole pig special, which seemed pretty reasonable.  I had the whole petrale sole which was ... well, for one thing, not whole.  You tell me whole fish, I expect head.  This just had the body.  Oh well, I'm probably being pedantic.  It tasted lovely, but the plate seemed a little bare with just it (and a lemon) on it.  It came with some artichoke dip and salsa on a different plate, but ... it didn't really make much sense.  Tasty, though.  \n\nDessert was pineapple cake for my wife (it came as part of the pig special) and beignets for the table.  Beignets appeared perfectly competent, though I didn't bother having any.  \n\nLovely view out the windows, delightful service -- friendly, humorous, and professional all at once.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-28", "description": "We were last at Presidio Social Club about a year ago, when it seemed kinda loud and kinda expensive but still a pleasant place in the neighborhood to spend time with company. Plus, they serve liver, which I adore and don't get to order too often. However, our visit last week  was oddly unpleasant, mostly because of the service, although the food and its prices didn't help.  We were seated promptly, with menus, but then sort of forgotten--had to ask for water, for a chance to order drinks, later for dessert menus.  The two male waiters serving us were clearly over-extended, and both brusque to the point of rudeness.  It was rather embarrassing, given that we'd invited guests to what we'd described as a nice, friendly neighborhood spot.\n\nThe Presidio Social Club menu is small, mainstream, comfort-food-oriented, with most entrees in the $18-$24 dollar range; however, it features several items that are not listed with prices, such as catch of the day, roast of the day,  and the oven-roasted rib-eye for two,  which is \"market-price.\"  Be sure to get the prices--our uncommunicative waiter didn't mention them, and we wouldn't have guessed that the rib-eye for two would be $96, or that a smallish piece of halibut on chickpeas would be ap. $34.  The under-flavored chick-peas could have come from a can.  My liver, on a modest bed of good mashed potatoes, was under-cooked, even for medium-rare, but rather than fight for non-existent waiter attention, I just ate around the squishy spots. One flavor that was present, in over-abundance, in the meal was salt--in the sauce accompanying the rib-eye and its (excellent) asparagus, in the truffle-oil fries, even in some of the ever-smaller cookies that were part of the cookie platter we've usually been happy to finish up our meal at the Social Club with before. \n\nI don't know--convenience, lovely location, happy buzz,  and the handsome interior have made this a place we've fallen back on in the past, but I'm not sure we'll be returning.  A venue this close to the competition provided by the restaurant mecca of the Chestnut/Fillmore area maybe needs to think about upping its game, particularly in the service department.", "author": "Chris C."}

Presidio Social Club ruined my new purse and my iPhone, inconvenienced me for a month, and did not reimburse me for the damage to my belongings! Sorry for the length, but customers need to know the risk of going to this restaurant. \n\nWent to the restaurant for Brunch on a Saturday morning and our waitress spilled several Bloody Marys and Mimosas onto me and into/all over my 1-week-old purse that was hung appropriately on my chair. The waitress proceeded to take my purse to \"clean\" it while I went to the restroom to wash sticky mess off my sweater, pants, and even the inside of my shoes. When the waitress returned with my purse, she had failed to \"clean\" off much of anything, AND failed to notice at least an inch of alcoholic puddle in the bottom of my purse, that my iPhone was completely submerged in. While I sopped up the large amount of liquid inside my purse with napkins myself, my husband attempted to dry off my iPhone, hoping to save it from damage. \n\nThe manager, Simon, gave me his card and offered to reimburse me for the cleaning of my bag. Our meal was NOT even partially paid for by the restaurant. Very quickly after leaving the restaurant we realized that my iPhone's touch screen was permanently damaged and the purse had been soaked through to the outside bottom of the bag.  We called the restaurant to immediately alert them that my phone was also damaged in this incident.\n\nWe are very reasonable people, and we tried to be as polite and as positive about this situation as possible, understanding that accidents happen. We even tried to reassure the waitress that it was okay, so she didn't continue to feel terrible for soaking me. \nAt this point, even despite not offering to comp our meal, this situation could have been handled with integrity and there would have been no problem. \n\nInstead, the manager had us return to the restaurant and took both my phone and my purse to take care of the cleaning and fixing himself (under the guise of trying to save us the hassle). At my own expense, I got a temporary phone from my cellular provider. Long story short, it took him almost 2 weeks to get my phone replaced and another several days to get my purse \"cleaned\". However, when I went to pick up my purse, the manager gave it to me to inspect in the poor lighting of the restaurant. Before I was able to even examine it visually, I noticed that it still smelled like rotting tomato juice and a bar. I told him that the smell was still lingering and the manager argued with me, saying he didn't think it smelled at all and that he took it to a \"reputable\" cleaner.\nConsidering how substantially the purse was soaked through, I was not surprised that it would be difficult to clean, so I requested that the manager either replace the bag or get it cleaned again. The manager then started to be very rude to me and told me that he would look into it and get back to me.\n\nAfter over another week went by, I received a voicemail from the manager that my bag was ready to be picked up, no other information. My husband and I went in to pick up my bag and found that the manager had NOT tried to get it cleaned again, had sprayed the inside of my bag with Febreeze without consulting me and was \"unable to consider replacement\". Since we were VERY tired of this situation, I could now only smell Febreeze on my bag, and the bag seemed to look OK in the dark of the restaurant, we took the bag and went to leave the restaurant. Upon getting outside the into the light, I could see that the inside of my bag was still caked with Bloody Mary film and still had stains on both the outside and inside of the bag (clearly barely cleaned if at all?) My husband went back in to demand replacement or reimbursement of my bag from manager, to which he replied \"There was nothing else he could do\" and would only give my husband the name and contact information of the owner after my husband threatened legal action. We have no intention of suing (lucky for them I don't have expensive purse taste), but I am frankly shocked at this horrible customer treatment over less than the cost of our group's brunch.\nI hate to think what might happen if someone is injured there, considering how unprofessionally and rudely they handled damaging my property.\n\nGive them your business at your own risk!", "author": "Kelley B."}

And you're Chinese?  I am Chinese, but even for the American diner I think they would expect a full whole fish if it is called a whole fish.  This is San Francisco, if you're afraid of a head on a fish, you better move out to the Midwest where you probably see more filets and fish steaks.  So pissed...\n\nIt started off bad when I booked on their website for opentable and couldn't add a note.  I called in to request for our table to be closer to the tv for the world series.  I was on hold for a while and finally explained to the gentleman on the phone for 5 minutes and then he asks me to wait for the hostess to add the note on my reservation???  I thought he was the host?  Now I had to explain again my story to the hostess.  And she said it is not guaranteed blah blah...Anyway we got a table near the tv but often many people were standing in front of it because it was sort of a waiting area.  That sucked.  We continued to watch on the small tv at the bar.  We didn't know why 7x7 magazine would put PSC on the map as a good place to watch the world series and have dinner.  Watching and eating were both bad to do here.\n\nThe food was super mediocre.  I remember coming here for just drinks and apps once and that was ok.  Price was quite high for items that didn't have one stand out.  Really upset about that.  Chicken pot pie had a filo dough cut out on top, very lazy for $19.  Can't you just make a nice pot pie dough?  I don't think its too much trouble and it can be kept in the freezer and then fridge to prep a day before.  Filo is like store bought, I don't think you can make filo yourself, super difficult and too delicate.  Meatloaf was too tight and flavors were weird to me.  Pork belly was very tender but boring flavors, nice parsnip puree.  Deviled eggs with a very small dollop of caviar was bland and not worth 20 bucks.  Smoked trout ok.  Smoked oysters just ok and had two little ass pieces of bread.  Farro for the wife, I didn't try it but she said she liked it and I've made it before and not something I would eat often.  Did the mac and cheese have some blue cheese?  It was a bit bitter and I had better.  And of course, last and only the best for last (pun intended), the \"whole fish\" which was a sole without head and tail.  It looked pathetic, garnish of box tomatoes were everywhere, the grilled half lemon looked dirty and the plate was so wet.  Should of let the fish rest more before plating.  \n\nService was whack too and hella slow.  \n\nYou have some what looks to be delicious food, like on Sundays you have whole roast pig.  That sounds good and I would love it but are you sure you can execute?  Don't tell me the pig doesn't have a head or tail.  If Chef Chris Cosentino said he had whole roasted pig on his special, I would trust him 100% to be freaking awesome, but Chef Ray Tang...I don't know man...\n\nAs my good friends know, I only treat dinners when they're super fantastic and I'm WOWed!    Thanks Derrick for dinner and being a great sport.  Sorry I chosed PSC for the 4th game of the World Series and we ended up going home to finish the game because 7x7 was totally wrong about a good place to watch the game.

I loved that they had their regular menu along with several specials.\n\nReally weird reservation experience though...Open table said they were full, but I called them up and they told me to call back Saturday to see if there were any openings after they confirmed reservations. I got really lucky and was able to make a reservation for 2 the day before, but it was so bizarre! When we came in at 12:30, half the restaurant was empty and there was no host at the stand. They were probably saving the tables for later seatings at 1/1:30, but you can turn a table in an hour. They need new hostesses.\n\nWe started with the gruyere cheese toasts and YUM! I was very happy that we did, especially considering we needed food ASAP after starting on our delicious cocktails and not eating all morning. We loved the cheese toasts and ate them all in roughly a minute. I had the El Presidio scramble with the PSC bellini cocktail.

I quickly called her back because the other 5 people at the table also wanted to order drinks. In terms of the food, my wife ordered the trout filet and it came as a whole fish with the head and tail. The waitress took it back only to return in two minutes with the head and tail cut off and now called it a \"filet\".  There was never a chance to order a 2nd round of drinks because she would never return to the table.  The whole dinner took three hours only because it took our server 5x longer that it should to do anything.   She was friendly, but absolutely clueless \nWhen the six of us got outside, my friend turned to the group and said: \"Was it me or was that the worst service ever?\"  Since we were 3 separate couples, no one wanted to make an issue of it at dinner not knowing what the other couples were thinking.

We asked for his opinion on a few of the pastries and he highly recommended the cinnamon roll, which was incredible!  He also let us know it was large enough to share, which was great bc none of us could eat one alone and still eat a main after that.

I have read the scones are also great, so I'll try those next time. \n\nI can't recall what everyone had for mains, but I had the chilequeles which were good not great...

Although the food is good, the menu is simply lacking in breadth or dept.  It is neither populated with basics such that everyone can find a meal, nor is it filled with items which are particularly interesting such that you'd be willing to regularly chance it with something unique.  The selection of main courses is often small enough that I'll go for dinner and simply find nothing that interests me, and end up ordering appetizers.  Previously, it was much more robust and interesting selection.  (Perhaps they were getting bogged down and decided to streamline the kitchen so as to be able to churn the tables.) \n\nTheir bar, however, is excellent, and so are the desserts, making this a good choice for someplace after dinner.  The lemon meringue cake is especially good if you are in the mood for something sweet, and goes well with a sidecar. \n\nWORD OF WARNING: CALL BEFORE YOU GO OUT THERE.  It is kind of out of the way, and we've trekked out there for drinks only to find it closed for a private event on a Saturday night.  Luckily, there is another bar/restaurant right outside the Presidio gate, but if you are making a special trip and don't have a reservation, be sure to call first or just go elsewhere.", "author": "Robert F."}

Which was a shame because with its great location, it should have already been a modern classic.  It's not every day you get to sit at a long bar, looking around at what used to be a military barracks, surrounded by the lush greenery of the Presidio. A couple years in business is not enough time to create laurels, let alone rest on them.\n\nBut everyone is entitled to a new beginning, and PSC is making some changes to revive what was had become a bland, overpriced experience.\n\nLast night my friend Michael L. and I enjoyed a late-night meal at the bar - simple fare, a burger and the fried chicken salad.  Oh yes, and the lobster bisque.  The burger was excellent - simple, well cooked, not too much bun, and with the caramelized onion/bacon topping - it was pretty near perfect.  With that, we had some truly excellent cocktails (me, Pink Lemonade; him, Manhattan) followed by some beer.  An enjoyable time all around.  \n\nWe had one critique of the food, which was that the cabbage pieces were too big to comfortably fit on our forks - we wanted more chop in the chopped salad.  We voiced this and were acknowledged and heard - hurrah.  We also got to learn of the upcoming improvements that will be made by the new management - basically, to make your experience better and more satisfying.\n\nThis is a reminder for all of you out there in Yelp Land - if you are not happy with something, say so.  Don't just smile at your server and say everything was fine, and then go home and slam the place in your review.  By speaking up, you give them the chance to correct it on the spot, or offer you something more to your liking.   If they are a decent place, they will want to ensure that you walk away happy.\n\nI'll be back soon enough to see how things are going.  Let it be noted that they are making these changes even though the restaurant was pretty much full on a Wednesday night - so while they don't appear to be hurting for business, someone there knows that it could be much better.

The waiter says,.. \n\n\"SORRY WE ARE actually OUT OF FOIE GRAS\" \n\nDisappointing much!

San Francisco Old School . \n\nHidden in the Presidio National Park is a long, rectangular wood-framed building erected in 1903 as enlisted men's barracks. This space has  been tastefully renovated to house the Presidio Social Club, a restaurant specializing in classic American comfort cuisine. \n\nStep inside and you'll be transported to an entirely different space and time. The open room is cleanly decorated with simple colors and retro decor. Large wooden tables look out onto the green Presidio park scene from wide wall sized windows.  A long white marble bar with leather stools and adjacent palm trees provides the ultimate old California flair. \n\nThe menu carries on the mid-century theme in its design and features simple brunch and dinner fare of classic American comfort food. We started our experience off by sampling some of the specialty house cocktails carefully created by the bar. The Presidio Pink Lemonade ($11 Meyer Lemon Vodka, Limoncello, tinted with campari), the 100 Reasons Rye ($ 8 Manhattan Variation w/ Triple Sec ), and the Sidecar ($8 Classic brandy drink from the 1920's) were delicious and a welcome beginning to our meal.\n\nThe menu offers only a few options of comforting American Classics (about 13 main courses ranging from $15 to $22). Side dishes, salads, and appetizers are also available. We began our meal with the Island Style Tuna Poke ($11 with Housemade Kennebec Chips ), the Grilled Artichoke ( $7 with Blue Cheese and butter), and the white bean specialty soup of the day ($3). Perfectly proportioned, savory, and satisfying.\n\nOur choice main dishes included the Fried Chicken with  Smashed Red Potatoes ($19), an orange glazed Pork Shoulder with Cannelli beans ($19), the PFC Meatloaf  with Sour Cream & Chive Potatoes ($18), and the chef's specialty pasta with pork sauce ($15). Portions were generous and service was fabulous. \n\nPresidio Social Club is the perfect pick for a family dinner, a lively brunch, or an old school cocktail date. It's unique atmosphere, attentive service, and comforting classics make it well worth a visit. Go, let the jazz music play, sip a cocktail, savor a meal, and enjoy the feeling of being in a mid-century private club.", "author": "Caroline J."}

Similar to Thanksgiving dinner in grandma's double-wide, chairs are jammed together and require those unfortunate enough to be sitting in the middle to hurdle the seats. \n\nService was painfully slow. The drinks were ordered after a substantial wait. The drinks were received after an even longer wait. More than once a member of our party (someone lucky enough to be sitting on the ends and have mobility) would have to go in search of our servers. Diners shouldn't have to do that, especially at these prices.\n\nOverall, the quality of the food was good. Just don't come here if you're starving. The portions are small, almost dainty. Room temperature water is served in old bottles and poured into juice glasses. Wow, water shots.\n\nFor a restaurant described as 'classy', order some more damn umbrellas!

Normally I would have tipped 20% but in this case I left less than 10%.  The waiter did not acknowledge the gaps and seemed far more interested in \"turning the table.\"", "author": "Mark D."}

Party of three of us were seated for dinner and after a long wait, were greeted and drinks ordered.  I received a glass of cabernet that was wholly lacking in volume and brought this to the attention of our server.  She proceeded to leave our table, return with a pint glass, stand it next to the wine glass and point out that it was an exact measure and that was their standard pour(l no more than a third of the wine glass), the rim of the wine parallel to the rim of the pint glass.  I suppose that if you have a tall enough stem on the glass, you can pour less.  Instead of bringing back the bottle and adding to the original weak pour, she taught this patron(never again) a lesson on what her establishment's customer service policy is.  Apparently adding a splash and making the customer happy isn't as important as stretching the contents of a wine bottle for maximum profit. Typically, I would have had at least two glasses with dinner, dessert, coffee, but after that interaction there was no way I would have another.  In retrospect, I should have sent the glass back, grabbed my jacket and hit the door with a few choice words for the manager, never to return.

I ordered a Mai Tai and A ordered a Gunpowder.  The waiter came back a little while later to tell me they were not doing Mai Tais that night and if I wanted something else - so, I decided to go with the Gin Fizz.  It was good, but I definitely liked A's Gunpowder better.  Tasty!\n\nAs for entrees, I decided to go with the special of the day, which was a Rock Cod with Gnocchi and spinach.  A ordered the Meatloaf - classic, with mashed potatoes.  We love mashed potatoes!  When our order came, the server put a plate with a whole fish on it right in front of me.  I was a little perplexed.  How was I going to eat a whole fish with bones and all?  And neatly?  I sat there watching it for a while and was just going to start eating it when another server comes over and puts another plate in front of me.  It turns out they had given me the wrong dish first.  The second plate of fish was much less intimidating.  Just a portion of fish with the spinach and gnocchi!!!  The whole Tai Snapper looked much too difficult for me to eat.  \n\nFor dessert, A and I were going to order the beignets, but our waiter said he was going to bring out something called \"The Dirty Dozen\" which were donut holes that are very similar to beignets (on the house) and if we still wanted beignets after eating those, then he'd bring them out.  We were fine after eating the donut holes, so really appreciated the waiter's input in the matter.\n\nThe whole dinner took about three hours.  The food was good.  Service was excellent.

Perfect pairing and just the right ratio where the grilled cheese dominates the soup.\n\nMacaroni and Cheese: Shells in a creamy sauce with loads of crunchy bread crumbs topping.

Sorry for yelling but this little appetizer made my brunch. It's just a simple grilled cheese YET it is so good, especially with the tomato dip. I mean I've had daydreams about that devilish little treat and just to be honest after that I was set on giving this place 4 stars. That's right! Presidio Social Club you had me @ cheese toast.\n\nThe service was excellent and no one gave me a funny look when I asked for fries with my \"homemade biscuits and gravy\"...well, my gf did but she always gives me funny looks ;)\n\nEverything we had ranged from good - excellent.  I even cleaned my plate(s) and washed it all down with a tasty PSC Bellini --MMmmmmmmmmm I love Saturday brunches with tasty food and even tastier bubbly and I think I could fall in love with this place. \n\nIn addition it's right across the street from a small dog park. So to my fellow dog owners, on a nice weekend morning you get breakfast-to-go and let the dog play but be warned your dog maybe more interested in what your eating than playing with the other dogs.", "author": "Troy R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-25", "description": "Ok, so was I the only one that didn't know that the Presidio in San Francisco was actually named the district name for the Army base that it used to occupy? and that there is gorgeous property houses that are former officer houses all over the former base that are now occupied by non-profits (swank digs), and this is all seated comfortably right next to Lucas Films Special Effects Studios - Industrial Light & Magic? No wonder this place is known for having some of the most high priced real estate in S.F and is the district where the likes of Dianne Feinstein and Sharon Stone shack up!\n\nThe main eatery in the central hub of this once occupied this Army base, and what was also once the officers barracks (oh my) -- is now the home of the Presidio Social Club. This place is right out of the 1950's without even trying; from the bar that was made from medicine cabinets, to the table of \"ladies-who-lunch\" taking in their lunch and cocktails from 11:00 am - 3:00 pm, to the 50's style classic cocktails, and a very simple menu that is offered from lunch to dinner with mid-century classics. \n\nSo how do the eats from the 1950's fare in a 2011 world? Not surprisingly all the food and cocktails are very familiar to our comfort-style food that's been running rampant through the country since our depression-recession hit in 2008 - but while familiar dishes in style, my question was could they pull them off? Could they make a really good mac n' cheese? a solid meat loaf?\n\nfried green tomatoes housemade ricotta, olive tapenade    11\nSo if you've ever had great fired green tomatoes you know the breading is light, but crisp, the tomato taste comes through, and if you're lucky their topped with a spicy aoli or remoulade - this wasn't quite that, it was a thickly breaded tomato (so less flavor comes through), and the olive tapenade although good, overwhelmed the taste of the tomatoes - though the house-made ricotta was a nice touch for a creamy textural difference\n\nduck rillette roasted cherry mostarda, rye toasts    8\nthis was my favorite dish, I love the ducky liver, so this duck pate, topped with a layer of duck fat and cracked pepper was fantastic then finished with the cherry mostarda - a deeply flavorful garnish, and eaten on rye toasts (the only change I would have made would make these toast points instead of Lincoln logs of rye bread that reminded me of dunking toast my mom used to give me with chicken soup when I got sick - presentation, and texture, nothing more) - other than that this was the cheapest and best part of the meal, and I'd like to think it was as 1950's as apple pie!\n\nmacaroni and cheese topped with bread crumbs    10\nso we already know how hard a sell a good mac n' cheese is for me, given how great my sisters's is, and how MANY people attempt to make this dish (it's like the quick go-to comfort food dish for every restaurant), so I was surprised how good this one was. With 4 cheeses, and what tasted like a herbed bechamel sauce it came out pipping hot and completed our time travel meal\n\nmeatloaf shaved rainbow carrots, mashed potatoes, fried shallots    17\n\nso if mac n' cheese is hard sell meatloaf might be worse for me, I'm very specific in what I like - I used to work with some real old school cutters (butchers) from David Berkeley that were local legends before the big box stores, so after finding the perfect combination of meats it's hard to taste anything else and find it good. I'll depart the secret to you: 1/3 82% ground chuck, 1/3 Italian pork sausage, 1/3 ground veal - finish it with tomato paste, mashed potatoes and greens. Every butcher I ask for this at Corti's, Whole Foods, Taylors, and Sampino's knows exactly what I'm talking about, this is what REAL meatloaf tastes like.\n\nThis wasn't quite that, as it was a full beef meatloaf, so a bit light on flavor/seasoning, but I loved the touch of the shaved carrots, and fried shallots, this made the meatloaf uniquely great for me.\n\nPresidio Social Club\n563 Ruger St (near Lombard Gate, in the Presidio),\nSan Francisco, CA 94129\n(415) 885-1888", "author": "Charlotte K."}

And while the third time may not have been the charm, it was still a good evening and fun was had by all.  We came here after a couple of hours hanging out at the Presidio Wine Bunkers drinking a few bottles from my stash,\n\nThe crowd is an interesting mix of locals, young singles meeting and greeting, formally dressed adults on the way to something else, families, couples, and maybe a hen party or two.  All through dinner the mingling was going on at the bar.  A small group of women met up with small groups of guys (I think one of the women approached them). A nice looking brunette in a black dress sat by herself for 5 minutes until a tall handsome man joined her (looked like a first date).  Two couples in tuxes and black dresses came in for a bottle of champagne before heading out.\n\nThe drinks are well made and one of the bartenders has been around the bay area a bit.  He's been written up in some local papers for his great martini's (with gin of course) and his unique Manhattans.\n\nFood is comfort food with an SF twist and has never disappointed.  We ordered off the menu, not sure why some people say they had to order Prix fixe.  This was the second time I had a party of 10 or more on a weekend night, and both times we ordered off the menu.  Maybe their host was trying to control costs or something. And both times we were seated promptly, though our reservations were earlier (7 the first time and 6:30 this time).  And I made these reservations weeks in advance.\n\nAt our table we had trout, pork tenderloin, chicken, mac and cheese, sand dabs, flatiron steak, and a few other dishes.  All were good (according to those that got them).  We went for a few bottles of the house PSC Red after some cocktails and champagne.  Not bad.  And the bill was reasonable for a group that size.\n\nThe building has been around for a while and the placards outside share some of it's history.  And if you arrive in the early evening, park in back and walk in by the tennis court out back.  Someone will likely be playing.\n\nThe main room is pretty loud.  If you are here for some intimate conversation I would recommend asking for a table in the side room.  Not as good of a view of the bar, but a few decibels quieter.  And in nice weather they have a few tables on the patio out back.  Haven't sat there yet, so not sure if it is full dinner service out there.  \n\nThe only other issue was that service was a little slow.  This is mainly because the same waitress served the other large table of 14 up front also.  A little much for one person.\n\nSo only 4 stars, but 4 very well deserved stars.", "author": "Jeff H."}

I sat at the bar and was greeted well by the Irish or Scottish (sorry I couldn't place him better) bartender.  I wasn't given a menu of wines by the glass but thought it would be safe to simply order a sauvignon blanc--only to find later it was far more pricey and less palatable than one I would have selected otherwise.  I decided to order a bowl of the soup of the day.  It was a very tasty vegetable soup...the only problem was, it was served in a plate with the edges curled up a bit.  I had a very difficult time eating the soup and if I hadn't been in a public location, I would have just drank the soup out of the plate/bowl.  I advised the bartender that the soup was wonderful but the bowl was a bit to be desired.  He seemed offended and stated that the bowl was the one the restaurant had selected and that it was \"utilitarian\"...to the contrary--I was advising him it wasn't.  So, other than being argued with over my suggestion of perhaps a better (or an actual) bowl, the atmosphere was wonderful and the soup tasty...if you can manage to actually partake.   \n\nIf the Presidio Social Club reads these reviews, they could offer this suggestion to their staff --when a patron makes a little comment, staff could very simply state that they'll advise the management.", "author": "Tess C."}

The \"family style\" sides were also small, basic, bland.  I feel like we purchased cafeteria food at a very high cost...$50 a plate, plus $30 for wine pairing. Can't even call this meal mediocre.

I had never heard of this place before, but I'm glad I got to enjoy this hidden gem before leaving the city.  \n\nAlthough the view doesn't necessarily showcase mountains or water, the big windows along the dining room allow for a quaint look at the nearby buildings, roads, and nature of the presidio.  It's got a retro vibe to the place and looks like they would be able to serve up a mean cocktail.  \n\nWe certainly took the opportunity to indulge for this lunch and I don't think we had a single bad thing.  We shared an order of fries, cheese toasts with tomato soup, and chicken pate as appetizers.  We can't get enough of fries and I certainly can't get enough of delicious aioli, so +1 for PSC.  I'm a fan of grilled cheese and soup served in an espresso cup, but I could tell my coworkers were loving it more than I so I let them get the most of it.  But the pate.  I love pate.  I devoured those toasts covered in it.  Yes, it's an acquired taste, but if you're a pate fan, this one doesn't disappoint. \n\nI also had a bowl of their soup of the day (it was potato and was garnished with bacon, how could I say no?).  Also delicious.  Clearly homemade, clearly fresh, but also unique and so worth it.  Then I went for the mac and cheese as my entree.  Another hit.  Super hot, but super creamy with the right amount of bread crumb crunch.  \n\nIt pretty much sounds like we devoured a feast, which we pretty much did.  Coworkers tried the burger, beef carpaccio, and open faced crab melt which that all loved.  I definitely recommend checking this place out for a nice leisurely lunch.

For those of us who cook at home, and for those who are just starting to do so, we deserve great service to go along with our meal.  \n\nThe Presidio Social Club is the place to go for both.  If you request anything regarding your food or your seating arrangements, the service staff will do everything they can to make sure you get what you need.  What's more important, they always act anxious and happy to do so.  You don't feel that at any moment they will be running back in the kitchen to complain about you.\n\nThe menu is a delight.  Along with their own more sophisticated creations, they  offer many dishes that are at home favorites.  These are dishes that most San Francisco restaurants would feel beneath them to serve.  One of my favorites, are their deviled eggs.  They are a great way to start your meal.\n\nI once saw a television restaurant make over show  host  yelling at a restaurant owner for offering deviled eggs on his menu.  He claimed that they were something your grandmother would serve.  I wonder, whose laughing now? ----certainly not Grandma.\n\nA couple of my friends and I had lunch there today.  Two of us ordered a tomato fondue dish that was essentially marinara sauce with Burrata cheese and basil.  It was served with toasted bread, cut into long sticks.\n\nBoth of us are Italian-Americans, so this dish reminded us of a treat our mom's would give us when they were making tomato sauce  (gravy to my friend from the East Coast).   \n\nWhen the sauce was simmering away Mom would give us a few spoonfuls on a saucer, along with a piece of bread for dunking.  What a surprise, to be served one of the tastiest dishes on earth, in a San Francisco restaurant overlooking the beautiful Presidio!\n\nOur other friend ordered the PSC Hamburger.  She asked them to hold the bacon, and since the servers are  good listeners, they did.   The burger came with lovely thin cut French Fries, which we all agreed were delicious. \n\nI am giving the Presidio Social Club the MMF  Four Star Rating.

The restaurant is one of my favorites because of the design and all of the pieces inside that contribute to the history. The cocktails were awesome. A friend recommended the Gunpowder, though it was not on the menu, the bartender made it anyway. We had the crab salad, excellent, the PSC steak, also delicious, and my husband had the beef liver and onions which he loved. To end our gluttony we washed all of this down with sea salt caramel ice cream sandwich. It had homemade marshmallows and plenty brittle. This dessert was a little piece of heaven. All of the staff were every friendly and warm. Even the hostess said thank you on the way out and I thought it was a nice way to bid us good bye.

Then the server had a problem with our giftcard and told us we can call in to talk to the manager the next day. So for $70, we left hungry, feeling a little sick and quite depressed.

It's pricey, but a treasure of an experience. I especially recommend dinner for the subtlies of the restaurant to be heightened.\n\n If you are as enamored with the 1930's (as I am), you will LOVE the room -- a long barrack decorated with large Palms, the subtle clink of glasses, dim lights, and attentive waitpeople who replace forks faster than you can bite. \n\nThe row of windows which overlook the depth of  trees as well as a  free parking lot (a true luxury when you remember that the Presidio is inside the city) is really nice.  \n\nThere's also a long lovely bar which can be a waiting ground or a destination, and a back room for parties. Fancy drink menu with the old traditional 1950's-esque drinks support the atmosphere.\nNow, the food: Not much for vegetarians, but there is seafood if you're one of THOSE vegetarians. \n\nThere are several mainstays on the appetizer menu and a special of the night, (which in our case was abalone with black radishes, which was surprisingly delicious). We also sampled the small gruyere cheese toasts  with tomato dip: which is a fancy and delicious version of grilled cheese with tomato soup. Kind of like at Lime, (which I also love). Of the sandwich section, the winner for us was the Sloppy Joe -- sweet and tangy, and hearty: the BEST sloppy Joe ever! \n\n Of the entrees which come with a side dish,  the fire roasted chicken with tomatoes was tender and juicy, but the winner for all of us was the side dish of mashed peas with mint. OHMYGOD, if you go to taste anything, get their peas with mint: a startlingly comforting and unexpected mash of fresh peas softly combined with just a few sprigs of mint. Amazing! It stole the show. \n\nAnd, that includes the way we felt about their desserts: esp. their chocolate made-to-order cupcakes (which have a fudgey hot center) or their Brioche Beignets (fancy doughnuts) which were piping hot  with cinnamon and sugar. Really good.You can get a mix and match of desserts like their (small) cookie plate for $10.\n\nWe loved our experience, but what boggled us, were the final questions: Which was better: the service, the food, or the atmosphere?  A lucky question to ask, now isn't it? It was an evening which filled our need for joy and not just our bellies.", "author": "Heather S."}

Maybe it's a set up and I've heard all these GREAT things. I'm expecting to show up and just fall in love instantly, like Lady and the Tramp.\n\nKinda not what happened. I will say the atmosphere is ridiculously cozy and warm while still sticking with Presidio charm (I'm an ex-resident, I can appreciate). The service was very good. The food: I just wanted it to be soooo much better than it was. I dug the tiny grilled cheese sammy, the avo-feta dip was just ok and I chose the sloppy joe, based on its reputation, much like my friend who'd set me up would say, \"You'll love this guy, Joe, I prommmise!\" Sloppy joe was just average. The slaw on the side was awful: it tasted like it was attacked by Bottle of Vinegar and his accomplice Salt Shaker in a dark alley. \n\nI applaud the dessert tactic: very creative. Pick your own two or three or even order a side. Not the most inventive desserts (I vote Lime in the Castro for that) --- but A+ for theory and presentation. OK, the banana creme pie was awesome. \n\nAll in all ... I just liked this place. *Maybe* I'd give it another try.

Rather than over-cooked, dried out beef and salmon - which I would expect when preparing food for 25 guests - we received delicious meals that were perfectly prepared. The service was impeccable, and they even accommodated a friend with a chocolate allergy by bringing her an individual sorbet. My mother made napkin rings for the event, which the staff generously presented as part of the table setting.\n\nI really could not have asked for a better experience, particularly considering we had no idea what to expect.

I totally saved my appetite, but our reservation was for 9pm (which is really LATE for dinner!) since we had to wait for the kids to be in bed before we could leave (and umm, no, we didn't leave them home alone). \n\nI came really hungry, and then kind of lost my appetite when I saw the actual prices on the menu. But hell, whatevs, it was V-day, so spending $ is probably OK just this once.... \n\nI ordered the salmon dish, which came with the oyster for appetizer. Well I don't even eat oyster at all, but I was so hungry that I had to eat it. It wasn't so bad, but looking back, I can't believe I did that. \n\nThe salmon was VERY filling, it also had artichokes with it. I don't eat artichokes either but that damn hunger got me eating most of it off my plate. \n\nThe dessert was OK but I don't like tart either, and that's what was in it. \n\nHubby ordered some beef dish, and his was actually better. I would probably order that if we were to go back. \n\nWe each ordered a pricey drink as well. Now I'm looking at the menu as I write this so I could be more specific with what I ordered but their website has a completely different menu from V-day. So it seems there is MORE food available! \n\nActually, this menu on the website looks very appealing that I might want to come back again. \n\nAnd lastly, I just have to say the table arrangements in the small dining area we were seated in had a weird feng shui to me. We were seated right in front of the entry way to the dining area, so the traffic from the servers just kind of bothered me. I know they had jobs to do, but I think we could have been seated at another table (it wasn't crowded at all) or that table shouldn't be placed there at all.", "author": "Anio D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-21", "description": "I recommend checking it out on a Sunday, when Off the Grid is happening on the lawn outside.  Located in the east part of the Presidio, this under-the-radar establishment is nestled and nearly blends into the Presidio-style white military housing. This one level restaurant doesn't look like much when you're walking up, but the moment you're inside there's a warm, homey but still classy ambiance. If you have to wait for a table, saddle up to the long bar and grab one of their classic cocktails. We stuck with the wine last time, which isn't the longest list of options but has some good West Coast choices.\n\nAfter being seated, we started with a variety of the small plates. One of their best offerings is the deviled eggs, topped with caviar. Nothing makes one feel more decadent than a little caviar! We also got a half order of the oysters, which vary by week. The island style tuna poke doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the menu, but is pretty good. Unfortunately it's took many chips and not enough poke. Outside of the eggs, my top recommendation would be the grilled cheese, made with gruyere and buttered. It comes with a little soup cup of warm tomato fondue to dip. While this sounds simple, it's hard to hate a classic comfort dish prepared by professional chefs. Before the meal we also tried the chopped kale salad (we're in California, it's not a meal without some kale). With carrots, radish, golden beets, toasted sunflower seeds and topped with sherry vinaigrette, it was far more flavorful than it sounds.\n\nFor dinner, I split the oven-roasted bone-in ribeye, which specifically says it's for two people on the menu. Now, being from the Midwest I can take down my fair share of meat. However, I feel I can safely recommend that this dish be easily split by 3 people. They come present the ribeye to the table before taking it back to the kitchen. Bone-in, it looks like something they toss the T-Rex over the fence in \"Jurassic Park.\" Sliced up and served with roasted potatoes and glazed sweet onions, it fills up a large serving platter.  The quality of the ribeye is superb and the seasoning rub on it protects that quality while adding flavor. I highly recommend this for any meat lovers. I actually found it to be much better than the meat I had at the famed House of Prime Rib. We ordered some sides for the meal, as we clearly did not already have more than enough food. The French fries are good but nothing to write home about. The mac and cheese, topped with bread crumbs is a much better option. As far as vegetables go (have to be a little healthy), the whole carrots done in sherry and honey are sweet but not overly so. Because when it comes to sweet, you have to save room for a bit of dessert. We finished up with the blackout sundae, which feels like a deconstructed s'more platter with ice cream and homemade marshmallows.\n\nFor diners on the lookout for a more affordable meal, they offer weeknight supper specials, which is 3 courses for $29 but you have to go with the entr\u00e9e of the evening. Right now I recommend Tuesday, as it is simply described as \"small fried things.\"", "author": "Larisa J."}

The structure is the enlisted men's barracks. It's so very 'Dirty Dancing' on the inside, like a hip summer cabin. Service was good.\n\nThe chile spiked roasted corn was yummy, the calf's liver was excellent (watchout, it comes with ginger even though that's not mentioned on the menu). The clambake is mussels and clams and potatoes steamed en papillote with corn on the cob and half a lobster. Everything was tasty but the lobster was outstanding - super juicy and tender. \n\nLoved the brioche beignets (although the mexican chocolate they came with tasted like sour milk) and the butterscotch pudding was fine.", "author": "Marina N."}

I had the liver and onions and my husband had the burger - both were listed as PSC classics.  While the chef accommodated my request for a vegetable instead of potatoes, the liver itself was very unevenly cooked.  Several bites were so raw and mushy that I couldn't get them down while the other end of the liver was overcooked and dry.   It was a busy lunch time so by the time the waiter checked back with us, I didn't have enough time to request a refire of the dish.  My husbands $15 hamburger was more like a $5 hamburger - small in size so that without the generous portion of fries, he would have left hungry.  Expected something a little more gourmet for $15 and certainly a more substantial portion.  It is a difficult location to get to so I don't think we'd go out of our way to give it another try.

I had heard such good things about this place but became skeptical upon reading yelp reviews.  I mean one of y'all compared this to Applebee's!  Seriously? Have you been to Applebee's?  No.  PSC has great food, killer cocktails, and a relaxing atmosphere.   Applebee's has a microwave and little league baseball team screaming in the corner.  \n\nAnyway, we walked here from our friends' place in the marina and had a drink at the long bar while waiting for our table.  The bar had a good vibe so we decided to enjoy our cocktail there before being seated.  The hostess had no problem with this.  Once seated, I felt like I was so far from the City.  The airy feel of the restaurant and the lush green of the Presidio is a nice change of pace.  When it was time to order food, the hits of the table were the meatloaf and the brioche beignets ( we would skip on the lobster bisque and chocolate cupcakes).   And oh-so-many \"Preakness\"  Manhattans.  \n\nWe actually had such a great time that I booked another reservation a few weeks later when my family was coming to town.  My sister is in a wheelchair and this was such a good option for us as we were able to drive to the restaurant.  Our group of 9 were seated at the awesome wooden table towards the front of the restaurant.  As my sister's flight was delayed, 3 of the 9 in our party were about a half hour late.  The hostess didn't get upset and we still got excellent service even though we didn't sit down till 9 pm.  \n\nOverall, I love the food and have had great experiences here.

I have to say that the food I got was amazing. Like, \" Hmm, would I remain in forced celibacy just to have a chance to eat this again?\" kind of amazing. And yes. Hands down. My Mom and I got the Bastille day special- rib eye for two with foie gras on top. Yes, as someone else posted, seared foie gras would have been better, but considering you can't get it that easily anymore and they only serve it underground at various restaurants, this beggar was not a chooser. It also came with a butter lettuce salad with the dressing done very nicely, just like how my family used to make, and a bottle of rose ( the accent on my keyboard doesn't work) and profiteroles. Now I don't really like rose or profiteroles AT ALL, so I wasn't looking forward to them, but the rose really wasn't that bad, and the profiteroles which came with and were filled with candied pistachios and caramel sauce were also delicious, and made me think that not all cream puffs were created equal after all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly to order, and the demi-glace... oh my the demi-glace. It made me question how every restaurant I'd eaten at in the past year was doing their's because PSC's was perfect. It wasn't too thin or watery, or too thick and gravy like, and had the beef flavor perfectly infused. You know, like demi-glace is truly supposed to be. It also came with a portion of frites that were light and crisp. They offer you a bunch of sauces but between the delicious flavoring of the meat and the glace, I didn't even use mine. \n\nI also found the service to be just fine. It was easy to make a reservation, and they called me the night before to confirm. Overall they were just really pleasant. There was a significant period of time in between courses, because there were 3 of them, but they include a bottle of wine, so my Mom and I actually appreciated the time in between, to talk and catch up, without feeling rushed or pressured. The whole experience really reminded me of my time spent in Europe and with family, and it was truly perfect. Seeing as how some other people went on the same night and are giving it one star, I really can't speak to how consistent PSC is between tables, but I know I will definitely be back at some point.", "author": "Hannah W."}

(Think liver & onions, sloppy joes, and smashed peas.) Well... no more. Instead, the menu is a much smaller, and boring, selection of dishes that could generically be described as \"American.\" As in, I can find it anywhere. A few token items from their classic menu are still around (endive salad, meat loaf), but the dishes that made PSC unique are gone.\n\nThe food itself was mediocre at best. I ordered the hamburger, and it was dry and mostly flavorless. (How is it even possible to wreck a burger?) My partner ordered the sole, a dish that would never see the light of day in the classic menu, and it too was bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe bar, thank God, maintained is usual standards of cocktail excellence and the service/ambiance were as great as ever.\n\nI'm going to give PSC one more try, but really hope to see a revived menu and kitchen on my next visit.", "author": "Mark S."}

I blame my friend Chris for this choice.  This place did not live up to the billing.  It's meant to be a supper club without the membership fees, but it was not really a supper club ambience, and I could have purchased a membership for the price of a meal.\n\nSince Chris is always late, we started at the bar and ordered roasted calamari.  This is a nice alternative to the fried calamari that is almost always greasy.  This had bold bright flavors.  There was a little too much vinegar in the sauce, but overall a very good dish.  The service at the bar was wonderful.  We loved the chit-chat that the bartender engaged in with us.\n\nOnce the other three friends arrived, we ordered gruyere cheese points.  Think a grilled cheese sandwich, and it came with a small expresso sized shot of tomato soup.  Five stars for this dish - it was warm, gooey, and oh so good.\n\nI ordered cream of asparagus soup to start - nice enough, and fit the bill, but the croutons were soggy, which was disappointing.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered calves liver.  This is normally a mistake because most places over-cook it.  Here it was a nice medium rare, served over mashed potatoes and had a very tasty chimichurri sauce spooned over the liver.\n\nMy wife had the lamb special of the month - two roulades, which were overcooked, and wrapped without trimming the fat.  This was a major disappointment.  It was served with farro, which was soft-cooked and tasty, and smashed peas with mint - way too minty - it was like eating toothpaste.\n\nTo finish off, we ordered a bunch of desserts.  I had the strawberry rhubarb tart with honey ice cream.  The ice cream had a very very strong honey flavor, but it was grainy.

So far so good. but then Meh again.\n\nNo reservation, they take us only if we sit at the bar. Ok - we can accept that.\n\nWe sit down at the bar and the bartender proceeds to serve water before we can say no. He doesn't ask if we want it and  he has no clue there is a drought going on in CA. WRONG WRONG WRONG.  Maybe he doesn't care.  Before I can see the water arrive without being asked I say - no thank you, hoping he'll take it back before i accept it.  Instead he says OK and throws the water down the sink and puts the glass to wash. Geez - I'm thinking = really?  You threw water I didn't ask for down the drain and then threw the clean glass for a wash. Aren't there plants that need watering somewhere nearby at least? Must you waste? If every restaurant in CA did this our drought would be 10x worse.

I had two pieces of white bread with no toasting whatsoever, with a fried egg on top that also looks like it was pre-cooked and super crusty edges, barely warm.  The b\u00e9chamel sauce tastes like glue - white flour gravy-like that felt like a truck stop.  I look between the two slices of white bread and find ONE - slice of finely sliced ham and one slice of swiss cheese. Nothing melt in your mouth and nothing that resembles anything I've had anywhere near France or in France including in NY. Not being a food snob but if you are going to serve a french dish do it right.

A thin slice of ham, gluey, swiss, b\u00e9chamel that was like a chicken fried steak gravy (and I'm the first person who loves Chicken Fried Steak - but get me to wyoming or CO where I have had the real deal)  hard crusty egg = kind of luke warm - ugg. \n\nI am not going back for brunch any time soon. Go back to Plow or head to the Farmers Market at the Ferry Building and restaurants inside. - too many other places for brunch in SF to put up w/ this.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-23", "description": "This review is for the Presidio Social Club as a wedding venue. We had both our ceremony and reception here, and it was completely unforgettable.\n\nA few details about the wedding, for couples who are planning and curious about how the wedding was structured: we had a total of 96 guests, which was the perfect amount. I would not recommend going over that, as it will be difficult for folks to be comfortably seated. We specifically wanted a venue that wasn't too big for our guest count, so that's in part what made PSC perfect for us. Our ceremony was out on the back porch, which seats only about 70-80 guests, so you have to squeeze folks onto the benches on the side and then there might still be a few guests that need to stand. After the ceremony, people moved inside to the bar area for cocktail hour and then a seated dinner. The private dining room was left empty so that we could use it as a dance floor. During the dancing, the back porch was left open with the addition of some seating and a fire pit--sort of like an outdoor lounge area.\n\nVeronica Romeyn was the event coordinator when we initially signed with PSC. However, about 4 months prior to our wedding, we contacted Veronica to schedule a meeting and received a notice that she was no longer at PSC. A few weeks later, we were introduced to Gail Lee, who was formerly the event coordinator at the University Club. To be honest, it was really touch and go in the beginning--emails would go without responses for days and even weeks, and we had a ton of issues trying to get on the same page. But when we had our tasting at the end of July, that's when everything started to fall into place. Once she got into the groove of things, Gail was so responsive and organized. She was pretty much a full-on wedding planner for us, despite really only being responsible for the venue. When there was confusion over the bill of estimates and policy changes, she was very fair and helped waive some of our costs.\n\nEverything was so smooth on our wedding day. Our friends commented that it was the best wedding they'd ever attended. Many people commented on how smooth the transitions were and how well organized it was. And EVERYONE commented on the absolutely AMAZING food. I have to spend a few words here on the food... PSC was kind enough to accommodate our unusual requests. For dinner, which we served family style, one option was linguine with clams (bride family favorite) and the other option was Wiener schnitzel with potato salad (groom family is from Austria). Neither of these is on the regular PSC menu or catering menu. At the tasting, I wasn't satisfied with the schnitzel and almost nixed it from the wedding. It is almost impossible to get good schnitzel in the US that is made from high quality veal, pounded very thin, and very crispy. What's even harder is to make schnitzel in mass quantities and serve it at the perfect temperature at every table. And let me just say this, the chef really pulled out all the stops... my old-school Austrian mother-in-law is a very picky person and she was the schnitzel was pretty much perfect. :-) Multiple people said the food was the best wedding food they'd every had. Thank you Chef!!!!!\n\nI admit that I had my doubts at the beginning when our event coordinator was suddenly replaced. And I had my doubts about the food when reading the reviews and even at the tasting. But Gail and the entire staff at PSC made our wedding day more special than we could have imagined. Thank you SO so much.", "author": "Cat U."}

Our food order came in an appropriate time, and extra plate was offered by our waiter to share my salad.\nMy butter lettuce salad was a bit disappointing - nothing but green leaves (some of them i never put in my salad at home - the top damaged leaves), and only 4-5 very thing peach slices. for $9! I would not order this salad again.\nMy husband ordered local salmon - and it was great! mid size piece cooked to his order, on a little bean salad (not much, but still) - $30, but made him happy (local catch!).\nI ordered a bowl of soup (chicken dumpling) for my mane course and it was very delicious and filling.

I should have known that when we walked in and I saw the manager and server ROLL THEIR EYES at the sight of our family entering (was it the children?) that it would be a horrible experience.  We came in at 5pm.  We asked to please bring the children's meals right away and also provided the grandparents' low sodium requests.  We were assured this would be no problem.  Lo and behold, the children's meals did not arrive until almost 75 minutes later--75 minutes!  We sustained on french fries though the poor grandparents coudn't share in this appetizer.  Then the $100 steak rib eye came I was going to share with my husband -- a ONE HUNDRED dollar beautiful steak was suffocated under at least 2lbs of GARLIC fries.  The whole meals was the saltiest meal ever.  They knew how upset we were and offered a free dessert - no thanks.  We couldn't get outa of there any sooner.

We walk in and are seated promptly (well, two of my friends were seated promptly, while my other friend and I strolled in 20 minutes late).\n\nThe food and service:\nFor the most part, the food is simple but tasty.  We kicked it off with an order of the beignets accompanied by melted chocolate sauce.  They were very tasty little nuggets of fried happiness.  Everyone (with the exception of the mother-to-be, don't fret) put in for a cocktail order:  Bloody Mary for me and Mimosa's for the others.  At the same time, we put in for our brunch orders.  And then we waited, and chatted and waited some more.  After about 15 minutes, we stopped our waiter to ask about our drink order, and he realized that he hadn't actually put the drink order in.  Within a few minutes, we received our cocktails.  The world had been slightly righted again, as I sipped my very spicy, tasty drink.\n\nThe food arrived and we dug in.  I had the basic two eggs over medium, potatoes and sausage with biscuit.  Everything that I ordered was OK, though I wouldn't say that I was blown completely away.  My one friend got the biscuits and gravy, and this seemed to be the winner.  Another friend had the quiche, which also seemed pretty solid and tasty.\n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday brunch with good friends, good food, but not the greatest service, though I think that our situation was not the norm.

Suit up, order a classic cocktail, and enjoy the ride. \n\nThere should be more restaurants like this everywhere. The menu is very reasonably priced with most entrees going for less than $20 and generally focused on modernized versions of classic American comfort food - meatloaf, mac and cheese, even liver and onions! I will say that the pricing on the appetizers was a bit weird as they aren't significantly cheaper than the entrees so it's tough to really explore the menu unless you go in a bigger group. If only PSC wasn't located in the middle of nowhere, it'd be the perfect place to stop off for lunch or after work or late night. Or, whenever. \n\nMake sure to save room for the diner-inspired desserts - lemon merengue pie or butterscotch pudding.

My second trip to Presidio SC last night was with 9 other friends, for a birthday party. Our large party was graciously accepted and catered to, which is a breath of fresh air as many SF restaurants begrudgingly take on large groups. \n\nThe barrack-esque restaurant has a classic feel, from the airy, crisp decor to the white-coated, bow-tied bartenders and the stainless steel bar. While this could be hokey in another context, the vibe is genuine and tasteful. From the moment we entered and all the way through our much extended dinner, the staff was friendly, hospitable, and accommodating- we brought a birthday cake, and the hostess and server were more than happy to whisk it away and bring it back post-dinner for the perfect, candle-adorned surprise. \n\nThe food is well done, and the list of \"throw-back\", Mad Men style cocktails rounds out the menu. Be forewarned, however, that the menu is extremely (read: almost entirely) meat heavy: as a vegetarian, I found little more than salad and brussle sprouts to dine on. Also, while I appreciate the \"classic\" theme of this place, I like to see local SF spots supporting local/organic farms- I didn't see any of this on the menu, even with all the meat that is being served. \n\nI recommend this spot for a date that is a break away from the crowded wine-bars and swanky, uppity restaurants of the surrounding area, or for dining with your parents when they are in town. Take a post-dinner stroll up the hill in the Presidio for a breathtaking view to round out the night.", "author": "Kat D."}

I had a Ramos Gin Fizz, one of my favorite cocktails.  However, I watched the bartender make it and was highly disappointed.  He seemed to use pre-made egg whites, which were sitting on the counter.  He didn't shake it enough, which meant that it wasn't as frothy as it ought to be.

It's a lovely space, and parking is free and plentiful--huzzah!!  (I noticed that the 43 Masonic goes right by the restaurant, in case you're on Muni.)\n\nWe shared three of the antipasti (3 for $10):  the pesto carrots, caponata, and the chili-spiked corn.  Mature and generally well-behaved are we, but we very nearly began wrestling over the last of the corn.   All three were terrific, but the corn was To Die For.\n\nWe each had a Cesar salad (great white anchovies, if you like such things).  Next time we'll share one--it was just too much food.  He had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes and I had the braised pork, with liberal sharing back and forth.  The meatloaf was very good, but the pork--oh, the pork...!  Served on top of green beans and stewed heirloom tomatoes, it was light and full of flavor, and the pork was tender as a mother's heart.\n\nDessert for me was the lemon meringue cake (yum) and for him was the malt ball ice cream thingy, which came with three chocolate chip cookies.  All divine.\n\nThe host and our servers were terrific--friendly, flexible, efficient.  I love good service, and PSC provided that.\n\nThe one wrinkle, and it was a small one, was that whoever retrieves the wine for the server sent us the wrong wine (both wines were French).  It was rectified before the bottle was opened and apologies were duly made.  In a similar vein, PSC's wine list could use some spiffing up to match the quality of their food.  In mitigation, though, I did notice that they had some offerings last night that were better than those on the wine list on their website.   Corkage is $15, which is quite reasonable.\n\nI'll have another chance to dine there on Saturday night, and I'm looking forward to it very much.", "author": "Earline A."}

We came here for a family reunion, lunch was $28 per person, and they had 3 options for lunch to choose from (and an appetizer of mini grilled cheese sandwiches and a tiny cup of tomato soup, which was shared family style so each person got one of the four tiny sandwiches) :\n\nBiscuits and Gravy:  the biscuit was pretty good, the gravy was creamy and had a little spice to it.  The menu said it came with scrambled eggs and bacon, but instead they brought out all the dishes with poached eggs and no bacon.  When we mentioned it, they returned a few minutes later with sides of bacon.  It was chewy and tough, not my favorite.  The house potatoes were probably the worst I've ever had.  They seemed old and looked like they'd been sitting around since yesterday.  The biscuits and gravy dish had the most amount of food on the plate out of the three options.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\nChicken Paillard:  basically this was a small salad of fresh greens with some sliced chicken breast scattered about on the plate.  This was the smallest of the three options.  When it arrived at the table, I literally laughed out loud because it was so ridiculously small and certainly not worth the price.  I couldn't believe that they considered this little side salad as an entree.  It was sad.  \n\nBeef Brisket Sandwich:  This one looked decent, and my relatives said it was tasty.  Basically it was just some beef and sauce with some kimchi in between two really big slices of bread.  Not sure it was worth the price either.  \n\nI would have been more satisfied if each person got a choice of an appetizer instead of sharing what was basically a grilled cheese sandwich that was cut into fourths.  Sharing it basically made lunch a one course meal for $28 instead of what should have been a 2 or 3 course meal, for the price.  I think they need to rework their banquet/group menu because it was just a joke.  \n\nSo overall, I would not recommend this place for groups in terms of food choices.  It just was not worth it.\n\nI MAYBE would be willing to try this place again someday because the other food on the menu sounds good and the grilled cheese and tomato soup was good.

If I go back one day, I'm definitely going to get the meat loaf that everyone seems to rave about.\n\nOf course, we had to get dessert, so we actually ordered four: the banana cream pie, the chocolate cupcakes, the beignets and the butterscotch pudding.\n\nTHE BEST: chocolate cupcakes. They are made to order, and three mini chocolate cupcakes (served warm) come with a small dollup of cream and chocolate syrup. They have small krispy chocolate balls on the top of the cupcakes which give a good contrast of textures, and in the center: gooey melted chocolaty goodness. It was chocolaty enough, but not chocolate overkill. Definitely get this dessert.\n\nSecond best: banana cream pie. It actually came atop a type of flaky, layered crust. Good banana flavor and the pudding was creamy and not too over-the-top.\n\nClose third: beignets. Coming from Texas, I would've expected something more crunchy and deep fried, but it's literally like eating a pillow. It's soft, fluffy and airy. They also provided a honey dipping sauce which was nice. \n\nDefinitely last: butterscotch pudding. I think it had a bit of rum, and the consistency wasn't as creamy or smooth as I would've hoped.

There were no vegetarian entree options except for mac and cheese--in SF that just seems wrong. They did have side salads and we ordered the kale salad. It seemed fresh and healthy, but it was extremely simple and lacking in flavor for $12...just a bunch of raw curly kale, a small handful of sunflower seeds and a tiny bit of sliced radishes with a light, almost nonexistent, balsamic vinaigrette. The burger my bf ordered was tender and juicy, but the bleu cheese they put on it was totally wrong...it was a thick slice of dry and extremely pungent cheese--not melty and gooey as bleu cheese normally is on a burger. The fries were really good, as was the soup of the day (cauliflower puree with a bacon vinaigrette), but you don't spend over $50 per person so you can brag about french fries and a cup of soup. The wine we ordered was a tasty red blend, but we found out later when we got the bill that it was marked up more than double the retail price. I can't imagine how they can survive with such a high markup on their mediocre food and wine in a city that is famous for its seemingly infinite restaurants.

I also slathered it with ketchup as it was pretty bland and stuck it on buttered and jellied toast (it was just eggs folks). The side of potatoes had potential, but were not fully cooked.\n\nI understand this place is known for it's cute little gruyere sandwhiches and cinnamon/sugar beignets, which we had for a whopping $8 for 4 small pieces of fried dough. Also, hot tea (tea bag) will cost you close to $4.\n\nIt seems to be a cool place to get together with friends and family for brunch, with some classics to boast of.

Seated just behind the Lombard gate in the Presidio, the restaurant is housed within former soldiers' barracks.  Marvelously reenvisioned, it has the feel of an upscale country club with a spacious, open dining room with a bar extending nearly the entire length of the room.  The classic feel marries well with the menu which features old school cocktails like Sidecars and Mai Thai's and entrees like traditional steaks, pork chops, fish 'n' chips and a $17 sloppy joe.  All four of us had the sloppy joe and it was damn good.  I am all about the new American cusuine these days but PSC showed me the classic American still stands up.

I watched Diet Tribe for the first time on Monday night and when I woke up on Tuesday, my jeans from two years ago fit, my friend asked what diet I was on, and I noticed my stomach shrunk. This type of science fiction does not happen to me, as I quit diets within two hours of starting and I only exercise sporadically. \n\nWith my new excitement for life, I celebrated with a dinner at the Presidio Social Club. Not only was I impressed, but I see it as one of my new favorite restaurants. \n\nThere drink menu is impressive. They have a great selection, including Pisco Punch, which I have only seen at Bourbon and Branch, which is not a restaurant. It is a cocktail with pisco alcohol and various juices, with a wedge of pineapple in the drink.\n\nTo start, my table shared an order of the Macaroni and Cheese. The only place it compares in the city is to Michael Mina's, which was my favorite, until I tried theirs, now there is an official tie in my opinion. It is creamy, but not soaked and has a wonderful crunch.\n\nFor my main dish, this is how the new thin me ordered, \"Chicken Fried Steak please.\" I loved it. The steak was a fillet, not too fatty, dipped in bread crumbs and fried like chicken. It came with some of the best mashed potatoes I have had and a side of garlic green beans. This is the Tuesday special, so if this is what you want, go on a Tuesday. It was so good. \n\nOther dishes that I saw that I wanted just by looks were the wings a la buffalo, the fondue with toasts, the Sloppy Joe, and the mushroom soup. I could not try everything this time, as I think my stomach shrunk. \n\nI did not have dessert. I know I often talk about it, but I was too full. I wanted to have the brioche beignets. If you go on my suggestion, have an order from me. I love there dessert menu. They have main desserts and side desserts. You can get one of each for $10.00, which I like. If you just want one, a main dessert is $7.00 and a side dessert is $5.00.\n\nIf you are a glamorous socialite, a hipster, a senior, a student, or anyone in between, I think you will love the Presidio Social Club.

The decor and ambiance is always nice here. \n\nMenu can best be described as comfort food with a twist.  I had the Presidio Pink Lemonade spiked with limoncello and Campari. Dangerously refreshing.  We started off with the Island Style Tuna Poke which can best be described as a ceviche type mix of cubed raw tuna and vegetables with some yummy chips on the side.  We also ordered a half side of Macaroni and cheese, and the crab stuffed trout.  Yes, that's right. The trout was split open and STUFFED WITH CRAB.  The trout was accompanied by rice pilaf and green beans that were cooked perfectly.  Seriously, I can't remember rice tasting this good at a restaurant.  \n\nMake sure you order the dessert. My favorite is the banana cream pie which is served in a very modern way (circular, on a wafer).  The bartender recommended the lemon meringue cake.

We shared a really good grilled peach, blue cheese, walnut, and arugula salad. Simple, fresh, seasonal, and super delicious. The mac 'n cheese we split was nothing to write home about, but my mom sure seemed to like it. We also split the pork shoulder with polenta and flank steak with mashed potatoes.

My flat iron steak was quite good, and I like that not only were they able to cook it black and blue, but the waitress didn't look at me like I had sprouted a second head when I asked if it could be prepared as such.  Prices weren't dirt cheap but they weren't nauseatingly expensive, either.  Service was unrushed, an absolute must for ladies' night.\n\nOh, and for the upcoming nightly specials, I would like to put my vote in now for a fried chicken plate.", "author": "Tanya N."}

Yesterday was the second of two disappointing return visits.\n\nOn a return 6 months ago for dinner the food was bland, and not just like lacking salt, but bland.\n\nYesterday, three of us went for brunch.  The dining room has not even half full.  Waitress was dazed and confused.  The kitchen must have been on a break because it took 40 minutes from ordering to get our food.  I cook a lot of eggs at home and know it does not take anywhere near that long.  Unless they were chasing the hens through the wilds of the Presidio, which I highly doubt.  And then to top it off, it didn't arrive piping hot.\n\nNot once did the waitress acknowledge to us that we were waiting an unusually long time, etc.  We even had to go to the bar to order our drinks because our waitress would never make eye contact with us.  The only concession made by the restaurant was to give us a free plate of toast - brought by the busboy, no less.", "author": "darla s."}

The atmosphere is a little more family-minded than other city spots and I expect that a good % of the patrons are down from Marin or Pac Heights so the crowd has more class than some other joints in the vicinity.  \n\nThe martinis were good, but not as dirty as I like them.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-02", "description": "Given the uneven reviews here, I was not poised to love this place.  But wow.  Good stuff.\n\nFirst sign of a good time: the cool space.   It has character.  History.  It was updated with class.  The bar setup kind of reminds me of an old-school pharmacy or apothecary or something (but with warm, flattering lighting) - I'm into the way they display their liquor bottles behind vintagey glass.  In fact, the whole place has that clean, airy, retro-modern feel that is very appealing.  I was strangely relaxed - as if I was far, far away from modern-day San Francisco.  Escapism.  I like.\n\nThe retro theme continued to the drink and food.  This includes portion sizes.   I mean, maybe I'm just used to monster martini glasses that could double as wash basins, but these were teeny-tiny - if I wasn't such a lady I'd have downed my sidecar in three sips.   Because it was smooth enough (and, on the lower note, light enough on the brandy) to do so.\n\nNaturally the dainty drink sizes encourage multiple orders.  After ordering three (and I was hardly tipsy - hmmm) from the dapper white-coated bartender, we moved onto dinner.\n\nWhich was suitably throwback.  The small, plastic-laminated, California diner-esque menu offered such goodies as Kobe-style sloppy joes (which we ordered - delicious) and liver and onions (which we didn't).   The textbook-perfect escarole/endive salad with bacon and fried egg had me angry that we were sharing (internal monologue: \"I want my own, I want my own, my own, my own\").   Roast chicken with fries: solid.  Trout amandine with brown butter and sauteed spinach: even better.  \n\nThis is classic, simple, honest food done right.  I like that they serve proteins naked, so you can pick your side.  I like that the appropriately un-huge portion sizes make me feel not fat (well, except when it came to dessert: I really wanted the individual banana cream pie to be bigger, and did I really have to share the three baby chocolate cupcakes with the table? They should all be mine!).   I like that prices are un-high and the clientele low-key.  And I like the nice, efficient staff.   I like everything about this place.", "author": "Melissa B."}

It definitely has the physical qualities to become a decent \"social club.\" Despite my review of the dinner I had there I will go back, but probably only for lunch. \n\nI went here for dinner and was thoroughly dissapointed. Their \"free\" water is literally room temperature tap water, same water that comes out of my bathroom sink. No ice, no lemon...nothing. I had to have them take it back and pay $5 for a bottle of spring water. For the price you pay for the food, you would think they could comp the spring water. Another outrageous beverage charge is the $4 old-style bottled sodas. Damn they're tasty, but $4 for a 12 ounce soda is uncool. Make them 2-bucks max and I'll buy more than one. Better yet, give me soda with free refills from the fountain behind the bar. \n\nOn to the food. The appetizers took forever to come and when they did were either way over seasoned or had no flavor at all. We had a tomato soup that was VERY good, actually it's the only food I had there that I can say this about. \n\nThe entree's were small, overpriced, and generally not appetizing at all. The chicken had no flavor and the steak was not only cold, but almost a nuclear red color throughout. (I asked for medium-well). I couldn't finish it out fear of contracting some food-born illness. \n\nThe food took so long that I had to skip dessert, assuming it would take another 20 minutes to come. \n\nTheir bathroom was surprisingly dirty for such a small restaurant. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice bathroom with a super cool trough-style sink, but judging by the copious amounts of urine on the floor I could tell it hadn't been cleaned/mopped in a long time. The restaurant is too small & not busy enough to warrant lack of upkeep of the restrooms. But hopefully it was just that time. \n\nAs you can tell I was definitely unimpressed, but I still have hope for this place.

It looked like another overpriced semi-Marina establishment that is cashing in on a location and a gimmick.  Well, I was right, but the food was excellent, so I can forgive Presidio Social Club its sins.  (You do not have to say 50 Hail Marys as a penance.)\n\nThe restauarnt is tucked just west of the Lombard gate to the Presidio on the south side of the road.  The exterior looks more like a trailer park office than a restaurant.  I actually liked the look though because the building seems to preserve the character of the old army base.  (This is a good thing people.  San Francisco may be anti-war, but there is no need to trample on the history of the military and denigrate the men and women who have made tremendous sacrifices so that we can enjoy meals like the Presidio Social Club serves.)\n\nThe interior is not very plush or friendly, but I liked the 50's feel it had.  Our waiter was very friendly, accommodating, and patient considering we had about 10 people.  Kudos to him.  The drink menu is excellent, and our waiter checked on altering a drink for me, which I appreciated a great deal.  The drink list is long and chock full of bourbon, rye, and gin.  Very much in keeping with the 50's kitcsch of the restaurant.  \n\nI started with the gruyere toast and tomato dipping sauce.  Totally overpriced at $8.50 because it was really grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Once again though, I was willing to overlook this because it was very tasty.    My girlfriend had the lentil soup.  She thought it was good.  I hate lentils, so I had a tiny taste which instantly brought back horrible childhood memories of being forced to eat lentils because, \"they's good for you!!!\"  We ordered two plates of mac and cheese for the table.  They remained true to the theme of the Social Club: overpriced but excellent.  I snuck a couple of extra forkfuls when people were not looking.  Next up was a spaghetti special.  Excellent.  Much better than the crap they serve at Delfina.  (This is part of my ongoing campaign against Delfina...a.k.a. the worst restaurant in San Francisco.)\n\nOverall an excellent experience.  I did not see any couples there, and I don't think it is a good date restaurant.  It was a ton of fun with a large group.", "author": "Chris I."}

I asked when the table might be ready and she indicated, without any certainty, that it could be twenty minutes or more, seemingly annoyed by my question. No apology was offered. Not a good first impression.\n\nOrdered a cocktail at the bar which was well made. We were finally seated around 8:40 in what had to have been the worst table in the place. We were surrounded by an aisle on each side that served as the only path of travel to tables behind us, so it was a constant stream of activity going by. Sometimes you get lucky with the table, sometimes not.\n\nWe started with a round of Caesar salads. Salads were fine, anchovies were excellent. For the entree my wife and I split a Painted Hills bone-in ribeye for 2.  Price was a reasonable $64 and included two side dishes. We ordered Broccoli DeCicco and fries. Broccoli was great, the fries were average. \n\nOddly, the waiter brought out the cooked ribeye, unsliced, and showed it to us before it was cut. Not sure what the point of that was and we couldn't tell anything about the steak from a visual. Nonetheless, the steak was served a perfect medium rare and had very good flavor. Unfortunately the entire steak was over salted. My wife and I are salt fiends but this was over the top and really took away from the flavor. Someone obviously heavily salted the steak after slicing as every piece was salty.  We almost sent it back but were with another couple and did not want to disrupt the meal, and I felt bad about sending back a $64 steak. \n\nI did not sample dessert but heard from my dining companions it was good.\n\nAs for atmosphere, the place was packed and extremely loud. On this particular night, it was not really my scene. Seemed a mix of Southern Marin and Presidio/Pacific Heights, and was an older crowd.  \n\nOur server was very good and friendly, and described the specials and other dishes well.\n\nI hate to give a negative review on a place that may have had an off night but there were too many misses on this night.", "author": "Mike W."}

The crab \"cupcakes\" sounded really unique, so I decided to order that and the cannibal sandwich. The crab cupcakes turned out to be just crab cakes presented in a paper cupcake holder. It wasn't has unique as I thought, but nevertheless it was delicious. I really enjoyed my cannibal sandwich. It was basically toasted \"black\" bread topped with a tasty spread and thin slices of steak tartare. It was really good! I was impressed with the portions because it really was satisfying. I would highly recommend this dish. Liz's slow roasted pork and oyster hash was wonderful. It was very juicy and tasty.

We took a long time to order, but only because nothing looked all that great (a rarity for upscale SF restaurants, especially one so self-consciously groomed).  \n\nThe only decent dish was the starter, the fish plate of the day, which was a local albacore (though, it was pitched as barely cooked, and in fact it was in danger of being overcooked).  The mac and cheese had good crunchy bits on top -- that was a solid dish, too.\n\nBut, the fish and chips were too short on the fish and too long on the chips.  The butter lettuce salad was good, but not great.  And the seasonal veggies--blue lake green beans--seemed like they had been cooked since the day before.  If the food was fresh, the chef made sure to hide it. \n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get one star is because of the great ambiance.  And the cocktails.

He seemed too busy serving the drinks for the waiters for those at tables, and couldn't seem to handle that as well as wait on us at the bar right directly in front of him. Considering the length of the bar and how busy the restaurant is these days, they should have three bartenders behind that bar to properly serve everyone.

So if the places are good, then it's super convenient and chill. As much as I love to be a diva, I much prefer a low-key, classy establishment to one with all the bells and whistles (and drama, attitude, etc).\n\nWith that said, I thought Presidio Social Club was a bit too high and mighty for its own good. My boyfriend made dinner reservations for 7, and we were seated in the main dining room. We wanted to order the buffalo burger  from the \"secret menu\" (Bunker Buster or something like that)... Well, apparently items from the secret menu can only be ordered in the dining room after 9pm or at the bar. This isn't exactly widely broadcast information. It also took about 10 minutes to get water and bread, and another 10 minutes to receive our cocktails. On a Thursday. Business wasn't exactly lining out the door. \n\nSo we spoke to the manager and the hostess to see if the chef-owner would make an exception just this once since there was no one else sitting around us. \n\nNO.\n\nSo my guy and I are trying to have a sense of humor about this situation. When he made the res he specifically said he wanted to order this supposedly amazing buffalo burger, that was the whole point of coming here. And now he couldn't order it?\n\nHmm. How do we resolve this? \n\nWe ordered some drinks and told the manager we would like to wait for an opening at the bar, and that we would eat there.\n\nDone and done. Boyfriend ordered the buffalo burger (which I had a bite of, and yes, it was worth the hassle and drama, but next time, let's avoid the hassle and drama shall we?) and I ordered the Mac and Cheese which was also very good. \n\nThe manager sent over comped desserts from the secret menu and the regular dessert menu (smores, chocolate cupcakes, and a coffee ice cream and mousse cake) and when the bill came we discovered the drinks were also comped.\n\nSo the Presidio Social Club handled their fuss and pomp with some class and dignity in the end, and my boyfriend and I may someday go back again. \n\nBut we're in no rush.", "author": "Christy M."}

For a renovated Presidio building, it is plush and comfortable and cozy.  And being inside on a rainy night, enjoying evening cocktails just enhanced the romanticism of being here.\n\nAll that said, my friend and I couldn't help ourselves - we indulged from cocktails to dessert before we had to finally peel ourselves away. \n\nTo start off, we went for cocktails...I had a French 75 - which was mixed well.  If you don't know what that is - a French 75 is brandy and champagne mixed with lemon juice - at least that's how they serve it here.  And from there we had the oxtail and biscuits, which is code for fall off the bone oxtail in a wine reduction sauce and served as sliders.  All that combined was a selling point for us.  For our entrees, the beef brisket was fairly good but not as good as the oxtail and biscuits.  Also, the mac and cheese was pretty good, but not being the big mac and cheese connoseur (I mean, some are), I thought it was all right.  \n\nAll was forgiven, however, and put right on track once we got to dessert.  Oh yeah, we were taking our time and enjoying dinner.  We had the cupcakes and smores.  Oh - and that's another thing - there is a deal if you get more than one dessert - there are desserts and then there is a siiide of dessert, get my drift?  For both, it's $10.  So, why get one when you can get 2?  We got the cupcakes and smores.  The cupcakes have a little crunch to them on top.  Then the smores are so soft, they almost smoosh down the second you pick them up - so be careful!\n\nEntrees tend to run around $20 here, more or less.  For me, the biggest winners were the desserts, the appetizers, and the drinks (including the tawny port I had at the end) - in that order.  For each, they ran around the $10 area.  I'm willing to admit that maybe there are winning entrees, but for now, I'm happy enough with everything that came before and after. \n\nThe service is also great.  I never felt like our waitress was inattentive at all, which seems to be a rarity these days.  She was always willing to give recommendations and was easily accessible.\n\nBe aware that it is a little tricky to locate.  The restaurant resides close to the Lombard Gate, you would have to turn on the very next street inside the presidio.  Well worth the trip, though.  If you have out of towners looking for a little of that old San Francisco style, well here it is.  Can't go wrong here.  Expect to spend a little; though, I consider it a small drop in the bucket when they appear to be one of those places that pays tribute to the hey days of San Francisco with the verve and aplomb of taking you back there with them.", "author": "Lorraine D."}

First, I have to say that driving in from Marin...it only took 20 minutes.  And there was parking!  These things become really important as you get older.  The building is vintage with ash beams.  I liked walking into the entrance and seeing the red 1930's drum kit with the restaurant's logo painted on the bass drum. The menus' look echos the 1930's style. Or maybe it's 1940's.  It's retro, but genuine retro.\n\nMy sister has a quirk about holidays in restaurants.  She brings decorations.  Always.  It could be cringe-inducing until you finally accept it.  So we had purple flowers and an easter basket, eggs, etc.  Then she pulled out some doilies.  Doilies.  I only mention this because our waiters got into the festive spirit.  One said \"Oh look, doilies!\".  That cracked me up.  Our service was attentive and relatively fast.\n\nMy brunch of two perfectly poached eggs atop a nice grilled slice of ham sitting on a half brioche and sprinkled with very fresh asparagus cuts was outstanding.  My sib loved her salad and my Godmother's hamburger looked good.  They didn't hesitate to substitute a side salad for french fries.\n\nMy godmother is 95 (god love her) and has everything together.  She was telling me in detail about the errors committed by Panda in yesterday's Giants game.  I mention my godmother because of the noise in the place.  It was not too bad.  We could talk.  There is a side room and the back patio if you want a quieter experience.\n\nNote:  There is a handicap ramp but it is in the back of the restaurant.\n\nThere was a wide range of customers...older, younger, kids (a couple, that's about my limit) .

The long marble bar is impressive, as is the subdued furnishing in the dining room.   \n\nThey specialize in comfort food and for once a restaurant delivers on that elusive home cooked feeling.   The liver and onions are outstanding and they have a very affordable wine list to find just what you need to pair those tangy caramelized onions with.  \n\nDesert is a little confusing.   They have \"side deserts\" and \"main deserts.\"  The sides are meant to compliment the main.   I never really figured it out.    Instead I went with a plate of cookies and milk and regressed back to 3rd grade. \n\nThe crowd is a little \"old school\" as pretty much everyone is over fifty.

Much to my delight, this was wonderful. The beef was so tender, almost like high quality lengua that had been slow cooked and braised for hours...but since it was kobe beef, it also had that luscious melt in your mouth quality, but still held enough structural integrity to not be overpowered by the sauce. And unlike the Manwich in a can (by the way, I do love) the sauce was not too sweet or spicy, with slow cooked onions and tomatoes.\n\nThe mac and cheese was good, but not great. It was more like a mac and cheese casserole and I prefer the stove top creamy style. The mini cupcakes was the other huge hit. My main gripe with cupcakes is the abundance of frosting; sometimes it seems like one to one. These cupcakes were topped with little crumbly, chocolate crisps that tasted a lot like Cocoa Crisps. Rather than frosting, a small glass was filled with fresh whipped cream. \n\nThe decor was absolutely cinematic. Bare bulbs hang from the ceiling, bathing the entire space in a warm ambient glow, but still retaining the upscale utilitarian aesthetic. Large windows, about a dozen ceiling fans and bartenders in white coats with red ties gives PSC the air of another time, another place...certainly not SF in 2007.

About 3 patrons at the bar, and a few tables occupied.  Patio was busy due to great weather.  We sat at the bar, and were told that they are only serving the bar menu at this time.  No problem we said... we were hungry and thirsty and not too fussed about a short menu.  Bartender asked what we would like to drink, I asked to see a menu.  Um... \"a menu, yes, I am looking for one, just a moment...\" and then continued to clean glass ware.  And then asked a passing server, do you have a menu, \"no\"... and kept walking.  another server \"no\" and kept walking.  a MANAGER, \"no\" and walked away.  So about 10 minutes after we sat down, there was our \"menu\"... she said the burger was \"amazing\"...  we ordered pretty simple.  A burger, medium, with a side of avocado.  A steak sandwich, with dijon on the side. She said fries are great, so no need to substitute with a salad.  We were pretty hungry, so about 5 minutes after ordering, we asked if we could order some olives to tie us over (they are on the menu)... \"sure\" and then another 15 minutes passed.  still no olives.  OLIVES.  put them in a bowl... how hard is it?  Olives finally came. 40 minutes after ordering.  The burger came well done. the \"amazing\" burger, overcooked.  No avocado.  The steak sandwich SMOTHERED with dijon.  \"We're between service...\" this was her excuse NO EXCUSES!  If you can't perform \"mid\" service, then close in between.  Avocado came after I requested it.  Could not be added to burger since it was not ripe.  Hard avocado, cold fries.  Completely NON-ATTENTIVE managers!!  They were aware that things had gone wrong, but did not engage with us.  Actually did not engage with another couple who had an awful experience... we got to overhear about theirs as we perused the menu.  There are so many choices in SF, why would we ever return to this place?  We just won't.  Staff didn't care about our experience... despite removing a few things from the bill.  We came to spend money.  We don't care about you removing things off the bill... we care about you having menus for patrons when they arrive, listening to what we order, preparing it the way we ask for it, and being empathetic and equally embarrassed for your kitchen when people have a shitty service experience from start to finish.

Right there, you know you're gonna have some strikes against you. We had to do a prix fixe since we were larger than a party of eight. To her credit, the hostess, Ophelia, was amazing. We had to communicate back and forth a number of times to sort out menu issues, and she was always VERY nice and VERY friendly. I highly recommend dealing with her if you have a large party.\n\nThe place was packed and the ambience was terrific. I really, really liked the vibe. It was pretty effin' loud though. The bar was sexy, though poorly located. We got seated fairly quickly though.\n\nAnyway, our appies (gruyere toast points) were solid and the salad was REALLY good. We each had our choice of entrees and I went with the flatiron steak. It was...okay. Not great though. We did have to wait a really long time between the salad and the main course though. I mean, a really long time. Our waiter was nice enough and managed to get all of our food out at once, but the people at the table next to us had major issues with him and with when their food was coming out. \n\nAll in all, it was a good experience, but the price tag was $107 a pop.

We were seated and received excellent service from the wait staff, prompt delivery of the drinks we ordered, description of items not listed on the menu, etc. An order of Poke and chips to start, an order of the soup and sandwich special, a chicken sandwich and side of french fries was our order.  The restaurant started to fill, but I would not guess it was more than 80% full at any given time. We started to see food brought to tables that were seated 5 minutes after we arrived. We finally got our Poke starter after 30 minutes, it was delicious and did not think that it would have taken that long, but figured that we were still OK for time. After several tables that were seated after us started to finish and leave our waitress came by and told us that our food would be right out. She disappeared for another 15 minutes and then came over to blame the slow kitchen on the large group that was there ahead of us. It did not seem to be effecting the 3 other tables who arrived ahead of us and were already served and exiting the restaurant. An hour after our order we finally received a cold side of fries with our lunch. The sandwich was well prepared, but nothing was going to salvage this lunch. We flagged down our waitress to ask for our check before finishing our lunch just to be out of the restaurant.\n\nThe sad thing is we had a really awful time there for lunch.

Old movies are playing on a TV behind the bar, where bartenders wearing old-school white jackets and red ties are mixing up tasty cocktails.

I can't think of another place quite like it in San Francisco and it feels very natural in its Presidio setting.\n\nAs well thought out the concept is though, the menu seemed a bit scattershot.  Tuna poke and Kobe Beef Sloppy Joes felt a tad at odds with each other (and the idea of using marbled Kobe beef to be lost in a Sloppy Joe didn't seem right), as did the marriage of some ingredients like those in the cutely named 'Columbus and Broadway',  fatty chunks of duck on wide egg noodles bathed in a butter based orangey anisey flavored sauce, didn't entirely jive.  The Pork with Oyster Hash was more successful with simple clear and complimentary flavors. \n\nThe portion size to price ratio was a bit off on a few things as well, perhaps something that is still being worked on.  Drinks were great, dessert was okay (the Beignets turned out to be donut sticks, good warm donuts, but honestly not Beignets).  \n\nBefore you go know that this space can get seriously loud. All of the hard surfaces do a great job of bouncing the raucous sounds around, thus making people talk even louder and the cycle goes on. It definitely adds to the 'social club' aspect, but I wouldn't mind it if they managed to  mellow the atmosphere a bit to allow for some sexy music to make it through the din.\n\nOverall we enjoyed ourselves and we will be back; looking forward to the daily specials, word is the suckling pig will be worth pigging out on :)", "author": "GIR .."}

At around 11am, it was very busy but our party of 3 still only waited maybe 10 minutes for a table.  Our server was very nice, quick and attentive.  I had an excellent bloody mary (not too spicey but just the right bite) and the tuna melt.  The tuna salad was excellent although it came on a big plate of fries which while good, left me wanting some sort of healthy veggie.  \n\nMy other friends also tried the Oxtail hash and Biscuits and Gravy, and we all cleaned our plates.

I really wanted to like this restaurant as it is one of the very few places that is walking distance from our house.\n\nFirst time I went I really didn't like anything about it. OK, so I was 3 martinis into the night and maybe i wouldn't have liked anywhere but I had been really excited to check out the Social Club and it categorically disappointed. Slow service, mediocre food and a very unaccommodating waitress. We had 6 girls for dinner so OK there were a few special requests but it is not like we asked them to COOK the Cannibal sandwich or anything totally outrageous! I think we were there for almost two hours and we had exactly two rounds of drinks. Maybe she was cutting us off, I don't know\n\nSecond trip to the Social Club last night was equally as disappointing. The ambiance is cool. Its different. It \"feels\" like San Francisco. The food and service are just truly lacking, though. The menu tries to be imaginative and hip, but fails on all fronts. Kobe Sloppy Joes? Sounds good and comforting, right?  $20 Manwhich is the meal that shows up on your plate!\n\nMaybe this is a good spot to stop in for a drink on your way to a restaurant with better food.", "author": "Megan L."}

Well, before I tell you why I'm giving it low marks, let me at least be fair and tell you what I like:\n\n- Better than average food.  I was really surprised, actually.  Good sandwich, and GREAT banana dessert!  I was actually blown away by the desert...\n\n- quaint setting, very casual, very ww2 in terms of the feeling of history (there's even an old drum set as you walk in from back in the 40s)\n\n- friendly service\n\n... OK, now I have to tell you what kills it:\n\n-  it's just too expensive for what you get.  I was shocked at the prices for a place that feels like a greasy-spoon diner with a little city charm.  I had a pork sandwich, and it was 20 bucks!  I dropped close to 100 bucks for dinner, drinks, dessert for two, and for that amount of dough, I could be at a 4 or 5-star restaurant downtown.  There's no excuse for the prices at this place, and honestly, deters me from going back....\n\n- Okay, okay, but maybe one could just go for a drink with friends?  Sure, except for that fact that they had THE WORST house-made red wine I've had here in the city.  It was just dreadful.\n\nI'm torn... I'd love to go back to give it a second chance, but as you can see, my first impression was pretty sad.  I live so close that I want it to be good, but it's just not worth it.", "author": "David C."}

We were very pleased with the whole experience.\n\n- The menu is short and sweet and to the point. Yes, they have a \"secret menu\" but so what. The stuff on the real menu is real food in decent sized portions at a decent price for the quality and amount of food you get.\n\n- Their \"special\" martini is awesome. We asked for it with 209 gin rather than their standard pour. It comes up with a lemon twist. Very nice! And one is plenty.\n\n- The night we ate there (May 8th) the special appetizer was griddle cakes with Oregon shrimp and chive butter. Very good. Three cakes, nicely crispy on the outside and smooth and shrimp filled on the inside. My companion had the crispy fried oysters (6) and was very pleased with them.\n\n- Since we were there on a Thursday, their daily special entree was a crispy pork shank. We were there at 6 p.m. and got the last two!! They only get 16 each Thursday and they sell out very quickly. They're done \"confit style\" which makes them meltingly tender inside with a nice crusty, crunchy skin. They were served with a delicious carrot risotto. As a word of caution, these babies are BIG so plan to take a good portion home.\n\n- The wine list is, like the rest of the menu, short and sweet. A well chosen and well controlled selection. I was surprised to see an Austrian Grner Veltliner among the whites. This is our \"house wine\" when we're in Vienna and it's nice to see it making an appearance on American menus. We chose the Pinot Blanc which was drinkable but undistinguished.\n\n- We skipped dessert, opting for coffee instead. I don't know who provides the coffee but it's very good.\n\n- Our server was a bearded gentleman who provided very attentive service with good suggestions along the way. At no time did we feel rushed in any way. As a matter of fact, people came and left at other tables in the room while we sat there enjoying our meal.\n\n- Check out their website before you go. The menu I saw on the website was the one I got at the restaurant so they must keep it up-to-date.\n\n- A word on the ambience: There's the main dining room/bar area and a smaller side room. The side room is significantly quieter and less lively. If you enjoy conversation with your meal rather than shouting, ask for the side room. And make reservations! They do fill up and they seem to do a large group business.", "author": "H O."}

Its a little late, due to the hangover which occurred, after I sobered up... which was after I ate at the Social Club. The idea of brunch on a Sunday morning after a Saturday night - well, its just ridiculous in every sense. \n\nSo yes, I rocked up to the PSC still burning off the alcohol from the night before. I know this as I admitted things no adult ever should in the presence of their ever-knowing friends. \n\nReview 1\nThe food. We started off with the pancakes. To me, they were a little on the eggy side - something I have never noticed in a pancake before, so I guess they were really eggy. Still, a pancake is a pancake and so long as you have them fluffy and soaked in syrup, who really is going to complain? \n\nI followed up with the kobe beef sloppy joe. I am slowly working through the 'you won't have experienced America until you have tried this' list which includes the Philly Cheesesteak, baseball, Amerfican Football, eating at a diner (that doesn't mean you, Mel's Diner) and so on... For me, it was like a tube of tomato concentrate had been squeezed over some uber-fatty beef... let me put it this way, as a child, I would dissect a hamburger before I let it near my mouth so I could remove all traces of fat and gristle. So I didn't really enjoy it as much as I wanted to enjoy the idea of it. But on the plus side, it didn't make me nauseous, which is always a risk the morning after. \n\nReview 2\nI don't touch Bloody Marys. Oh no. But, the main reason for visiting the PSC was on the recommendation of my fellow Yelper-in-training. The recomendation was for the Painkiller - a delicious creamy Harvey Wallbanger style cocktail made with OJ, coconut cream and vodka. Oh and a scraping of nutmeg. The nutmeg did make me feel a bit queasy, so I could have done without that. Asides from that, it was delicious all the way down. There are plans afoot to return to try all the other offerings that PSC has - asides from the Bloody Mary. Cold tomato soup with a stick of celery shoved in it really doesn't do it for me. \n\nThe ambience of the place made us all feel like we were in some colonial estate during the 30's or something. The music was lounge, Frank Sinatra style, and the staff didn't intrude too much on us. Maybe because we were the loud lot in the corner who were interrupting the quiet chill of a Sunday morning. All in all, we had a lovely time at the PSC and will be back again, although next time with less expectations on the food side, but more on the drinking side!", "author": "Catriona C."}

(And I loooove roast chicken and order it everywhere).\n\nThe decor relaxes you as soon as you walk in...your whole body eases and you slide into that cool-by-association mode.

Appetizers were great -- Oxtail Sliders, Gruyere Grilled Cheese sandwiches with tomato fondue dip, Artichoke/Spinach/Feta dip, and Bay Shrimp fritters were all delicious.\n\nThe Frisee/Endive salad with croutons, bacon and a fried egg on top was well executed and was probably as good as any Frisee aux Lardons you could get in Paris.\n\nMain Courses were a more spotty. I wish I had ordered the Sloppy Joe which was delicious... instead I had the Flat Iron Steak, served with the vegetable du jour, Blue Lake Green Beans with a Tomato Sauce --  First of all, a Flat Iron Steak should not be the only kind of steak on a menu -- it's the piece that you buy from the meat company in order to get them to also sell you the high-quality rib-eye or filet.

We live in Bernal/Glen Park, so a trip to the Presidio is a nice agenda item for an out-of-towner. Also nice for us SF residents to get around to other neighborhoods and be reminded of how beautiful our city is! \n\nVery cool, unique space for a restaurant. The building was erected in 1903, and from the pictures we saw, it hasn't really changed. It was originally built as men's barracks and the history adds to the intrigue of the place. They did a good job preserving some of the standard issue/GI vibe too - the hanging lamps, dish cloths for napkins, stainless steel/glass medicine cabinet look behind the bar, etc.\n\nWe started with a Escarole and Frisee salad. Very tasty, nice thick chunks of bacon in the dressing, and the fried egg on top. Would get it again. Also an order of the Gruyere Cheese Toast. Nice concept, but too much bread, not enough cheese. Would pass on this one. \n\nFor the main course, I had the Kobe Beef Sloppy Joe and was really pleased! There are big chunks of beef, seemingly slow-cooked as it was beyond tender. Reminded me of a slow-cooked pulled pork texture-just falling apart. The sauce was very tasty, a bit tangy, and for me, the perfect amount of flavor that added, but did not overpower, the beef (which would have been a shame.) The dish came with a generous portion of french fries (skinny pommes frittes style!) and a nice, vinegar-based slaw which suited me perfectly since I don't do mayonnaise. I'd get this again for sure.\n\nBoth my wife and mother-in-law had the Club Flat Iron Steak w/mashed potatoes. They ordered medium rare and it came as ordered. There was a tasty butter w/peppercorns melted on top .They both loved it -- I had a few bites and was very impressed as well. A nice solid dish for sure.\n\nWe ended up not doing dessert--too full--but the dessert options looked appealing.\n\nFor wine, we had a bottle of Havens Merlot Reserve '01. Was not familiar w/the winery, but it was a Napa/Carneros and worked well with the meal. Had some teeth, good tannins. Also, I don't recall the cost exactly, but I don't think it was more than $40 and when I looked this morning on Google, it was retailing around $36. \n\nService was good. Attentive but not rushed and a super-nice guy.\n\nI would definitely put this high on the agenda for dinner out when others come to visit (like my parents in July!)

They have couches, a huge bar, and great view of the presidio. It does get very loud inside, but the waiters are courteous with that.\n\nWe waited a while for our dessert. Our server said they had burnt the first one, and comped our dessert, so can't complain there! We had a light dinner. Snackage really in comparison to what the menu is. Lobster bisque soup and Macaroni and cheese. Oh yeh. It was GREAT. Perfect lil dinner. We would have ate more, but we were eating and spending money all day already. I would definitely come here again. What I really appreciated was the servers were not annoying. Confident, not overbearing and professional.", "author": "jj c."}

And I suppose it's a function of my advanced age that I have come to love San Francisco more slowly than the other places I've lived. Which is funny, because it is by far the most beautiful of these.\n\nCompared to Chicago, New York, Texas, and yes, L.A., San Francisco's special something -- that touchstone of authenticity that makes a place lovable -- was elusive. Until now. It's a restaurant called the Presidio Social Club. And I love it.\n\nIn a building that was originally an army barracks, the Presidio Social Club is in the heart of that lush geographic non sequitur set at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge. And unlike the rest of San Francisco, which works hard to make you feel like you're in a scene full of beat artists (apparently the era with which most locals identify), the Presidio in general, and the Social Club in particular, makes you feel like you're among the ghosts of the Greatest Generation. \n\nThe interior is stark but warm, white with dark olive accents. The tables are made of rich dark wood; the bar is marble; and behind it, completely at home, are vintage medicine cabinets repurposed for holding liquor. From the ceiling hang bare incandescent filament bulbs and fans that are one part P-51 Mustang, one part Jane Russell.\n\nYou could be forgiven for seeing the ghost of Ike in this place. (Come to think of it, I think it's time Ike jackets came back into style). \n\nThe food is fresh and creative, but 100% indigenous A-OK USA. My favorites are the gruyere cheese toast, the frisee and endive salad with bacon vinaigrette and fried egg, and the mac & cheese. The cocktails are noteworthy: the Mai Tais are the original 1940s Trader Vic' recipe -- \"no umbrellas.\" Yum.\n\nThe Presidio Social Club is an emblem of a San Francisco I can relate to. Come to think of it, I think there's some Raymond Chandler I should be re-reading about now. And some Hitchcock pictures to see.\n\nThe Presidio Social Club: it's swell.", "author": "Christian R."}

We had the artichoke dip (that was good, hence the one star, the other one's for the ambiance), beet salad (nothing special), mac n cheese (even kraft does a better imitation of cheese-i had no idea it was possible to botch mac n cheese this badly, completely bland and flavorless), and the fish n chips (reportedly just ok)\n\nI really wanted to like this place.

So we pay and start to leave.\n\nAs we are leaving and passing the front, we see the lady \"manning the front\" by chating with a co-worker.

I think my favorite part of the evening was when the hostess raved about how hot my shoes are - actually the staff was quite friendly and greeted us seated us quickly. They also brought our cocktails from the bar over to the table and didn't require us to pay up front (how irritating is it when they don't  do that). So for service: I say 4+ points. \n\nI thought the cocktail selection was pretty good - I got a pink lemonade which was a bit strong, but yummy and Eric got a Manhattan with some Pastis which he enjoyed. Not so impressed on the wine selection. The wine we wanted they were out of and they didn't have a very compelling alternative at the same price point. \n\nAs for the food: everyone enjoyed the sardines, but the fried okra was a bit of a let down - just tasted like fried dough. The mains were pretty good, but nothing really to write home about. Eric got the oxtail stroganoff, which he enjoyed (but wouldn't necessarily go out of his way to get it). I had to try the famed Sloppy Joe, which I enjoyed. It's much better than a sloppy joe - more of braised beef, which was good. The bread was sort of silly. \n\nI did enjoy the setting: a blast from the past. Would I go back again?

The bar is a bit of an afterthought, and it wasn't too hot for us to be standing in the only path the servers had from kitchen to table, but there really was no where else to be.\n\nWe had to order a Prix Fixe since we were a big party.  I had the Gruyere Toasts (awesomey horsraddishey tomatoey), and the romaine salad (cruncy rockin good), and then the Club Flat Iron Steak Topped with Peppercorn Butter and Mushroom Sauce... which was pretty good for a skirt steak, but definitely not $25 good, I'd give it $14. The french fries served with it were TOO DIE FOR though.\n\nA friend sitting next to me had the Trout.  It was really boring with very little flavor. I don't know how they came up with a $19 price tag for that dinky thing.\n\nThe Lemon Meringue Tart dessert was really really good. Perfect sweet-to-tart ratio.\n\nThe service was weird, our waiter seemed friendly enough at the beginning, but his personality died about 1/4 of the way through dinner. Our food came out with great timing and everything was the right temperature, but something was missing.\n\nWhile we were there, I watched one person (another table) remind the server a couple times that she was sitting there with no food while everyone else at the table had theirs.

Not sure if my expectations were high because I left feeling a little disappointed.

The beet salad was ok, but a bit too much greens.  The cheese bread was tasty and the tomato sauce that came with it had a nice kick.  For our main courses, hubby had the kobe beef sloppy joe - nothing too impressive.  I had the braised short rib - didn't really have too much flavor so I had a lot left on my plate.\n\nLuckily dessert was the saving grace.  I had the lemon meringue tart and a side of the smores.  The tart could do without the layer of raspberry gel on the plate.  I liked that the smores came with a shot of milk.  Hubby had the beignets and the pudding.  Both were ok.\n\nSomeone else had ordered coffee and it smelled so good I was looking forward to it all during dinner, but my cup tasted watered down.

Why, yes, because I had read all the reviews about the fantastic bartender, and even though I don't know if it was in fact him, we were served manhattans by a charming young man. No sooner had we received our cocktail, than our hostess showed up with her silver tray to take us to our table by the window. The evening was off to a splendid start, indeed. \n\nOur waiter showed up just as I had positioned my napkin on my lap. To my horror, I observed that the retro tea towel had left lint on my black pants. (I thought restaurants thought that sort of thing through in this day and age.) I asked for a replacement and our waiter said, \"I'll try to come up with something.\" I felt like I was the first person to bring the lint situation to his attention and I definitely got the impression I put him out. To tell you the truth, I was a little worried at what he might come up with, but he returned with a lovely white napkin. \n\nWe had previewed the menu online and had an idea what we were hungry for. I ordered the poke and my date ordered the Cesar salad. The poke was fresh and tasty, but the chips were overly peppery. The salad was overdressed and not with what should be named Cesar.  Our wine order had been taken and delivered.\n\nUpon finishing our first course our dishes were removed and our main course arrived, immediately. I would have liked to have taken a breath, but given the alternative of a long wait, I shouldn't complain. We had the liver and onions with a side of spinach, and the pork chop with peaches and a side of mashed peas and mint. I order liver and onions whenever it is on the menu and I wasn't disappointed. All in all, the entrees and sides were delicious. Our empty plates were cleared, but then we waited. And waited. My date said it was 30+ minutes. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Oh, actually, I did see him milling about the bar at one point. Eventually, he came by to offer us coffee and dessert. My date was pretty p.o.'d about the service at that point, but I went ahead and ordered the cupcakes I had read so much about. The cream with the cupcakes was to die for. \n\nWe weren't in any hurry, and overall enjoyed the evening, but my date was all about the Michael Bauer review, and wasn't surprised by the less than stellar service. It dawned on me that maybe the negative reviews about service are a result of this one waiter. I would like to test the theory, and because I am the one who books the reservations when we eat out, we will go back to the Presidio Social Club. I will not wear black pants, though.", "author": "Donna C."}

(no space numbers). We entered the crossover Malt Shop/Upscale restaurant bar to find no one manning the front. Shortly a young woman was able to seat the three of us. The waiter, a pleasant young man told us of the specials; an amazing butternut squash soup (he included the list of ingredients with flourish) I selected the 'Local Rock Cod sandwich with Gruyere cheese which comes with an arugula salad. I asked for it with no cheese. I received it with the cheese and back it went returning shortly as pieces of fish in a bare bun period. The rest of the fanfare was deleted. My first anticipatory bite yielded a flavorless sinew and hunk of fat as did subsequent bites. As I was not going to make more of a fuss I ate what was edible and left the rest (about 60 edible/40 not). Lemonade was good just the right tart to sweet and it tasted real or per the menu (Seasonal) as they have two variations on Lemonade (what would the other be?). The salad served on the same plate came with very little if any dressing so I asked for dressing and was given a tasty white vinaigrette under some other name.  The service was good the location open and cool with the view of the edge of the Presidio and some of the city streets through the trees. All in all I would not try the fish (read crab cakes review) and my take here is it is a hang out for the locals who work in the area and I would bet a Friday after work this place is probably jammed with drinkers who probably don't much care about the quality of food they are using to absorb the alcohol.", "author": "Michael M."}

It's got a great ambiance and great food, and I appreciated how accommodating the staff was when I needed to change my reservation for our large group. Our waiter was attentive and helpful despite having two large tables in his section during  a busy night. \n\nEveryone at our table really enjoyed their meal- pork shoulder and prime rib were the biggest hits but everyone joined the clean plate club. And my god, the desserts. I am a dessert girl- but even my non-dessert friends inhaled these, they were so delicious.\n\nI just had one complaint last night- I brought two bottles of wine with me, in part because I wanted to make a contribution to the cost of the meal (knowing that my fabulous friends and family wouldn't let me pay on my birthday) and because I really happened to enjoy these wines and had been saving them for a special occasion.  I also know restaurants really prefer that you purchase their alcohol because it's a good money-maker but that's why corkage fees exist, right? \n\nWell, I'm not sure if it was a manager or some other staff person who opened the first bottle of wine for us, but she tapped me on the shoulder and asked me to taste what I had brought as the cork had popped out and she thought it smelled like corked wine.  I appreciated her concern, but I tasted it and I thought it was fine, maybe not as great as it had been the day I bought it at (my favorite) winery but it suited my standards. My annoyance came when she kept insisting that the wine was bad- saying over and over again, loudly, that it didn't smell right - thank you, but we'll go ahead with this one (and the other I brought, which is also fine).  \nWhat if that wine had been a gift from someone at the table? No need to make them feel embarrassed (or to make me feel embarrassed!) about the quality of their contribution.  \nI got the impression she was irritated that I had not turned around and purchased a bottle from her. Charge me your corkage fee, but please don't make loud pronouncements about the wine I bring and choose to enjoy. \n\nOtherwise, great meal and great service.", "author": "Mary T."}

Good food--nothing fancy, but fresh ingredients and well prepared. Very attentive service and the atmosphere has a nice 1940s touch without being too over the top. My wife and I took my mom and grandmother to dinner there and it strikes me as a perfect place for parents and other out of town guests--good food, feels very San Francisco, and \"hip\" in an accessible sort of way. We liked it and I'm sure we'll be back.\n\nUPDATE: Went back last night and have to update my review and take away a star. The food was good (the desserts were excellent) but the service was terrible. They forgot to bring our salads, skipping right to the entrees, it was impossible to get the staff's attention, and we were dying of thirst because we couldn't get our water re-filled.

I had the soup of the day (vegetable with fried garbanzos), gruyere cheese toast and shared a lemon meringue cake.  The soup was very salty, a shame as it otherwise had excellent flavor.  It favored cabbage and garlic, but then so do I.  I have an obsession with having my soup very hot and returned it to the kitchen when it came out warm.  Yes, I know many people like their soup cooler than I do.  The 4 points of gruyere toast were buttered and grilled with a thin slices of gruyere.  I would have like a little more grilling time for a crunchier toast, and a little less butter, as it overwhelmed the amount of gruyere used.  The tomato dip with it was a thick bisque, very good in this version of grilled cheese and tomato soup.  I would order it again.  My coffee was very strong- just as I like it.  My companion's ginger mint iced tea had a surprisingly delicate flavor approach.  Her burger was excellent, though tended more toward well done than medium well, so check exactly what their chef refers to as degree of doneness.  We both liked the lemon meringue cake very well, and had no trouble finishing it off.  We ended up having two waiters, one of whom was fairly good.  The other kept an excellent eye on us, and even remembered to refill my coffee (which I had delayed) at the end of the meal.", "author": "Phyllis H."}

I felt like I had stepped back in time.  Which is strange, since it's very modern inside, but also very retro.  The way that works is interesting.  It's minimalist, and sleek, but with retro fixtures --- the fans, the wait staff's uniforms, the bar cabinets that are reclaimed from the old Letterman Army Medical Center just down the street, the end cut hardwood floors, the tea towels that act as napkins, and the wash basins in the bathroom that aren't quite sure if they're basins or urinals.  \nThe staff wavered between excited for opening night, to polite and attentive (almost to a fault) to completely distracted and aloof.  The food was. . . . . well.  The menu is very \"down home\" with nightly family style dinners to come (one main, two sides, a dessert, etc.).  They've got a few salads, some sandwiches/burgers, and then a standard steak/chop/chicken menu.  Plenty of apps and desserts, and a decent selection of cocktails and wines --- including the house \"Presidio Social Club\" red or white.  Roomie and I shared the Hawaiian poke which was combined with mango, onion, cucumber and ?seaweed?  It was served with yummy housemade potato chips, but to me, it just tasted of the sea.  I could've been swimming at Ocean Beach with my mouth open and had a similar taste sensation.  Good, bad, you decide.  We also had the Gruyere cheese toasts with tomato fondue dipping sauce.  Let's be real.  It's a grilled cheese sandwich cut into quarters, served with a ramekin of thick tomato soup.  I was ready for this to be awesome, but it was overwhelmed by the caraway seeds in the bread.  I don't like licorice.  Be it anise, fennel, or caraway, so this may be a personal thing, but I couldn't taste the gruyere at all.  \nI LOVE the space --- there is a private room and soon to be outdoor patio, and the fact that it's an old community center, that used to be barracks, and all of the reclaimed materials they've used, means it's heaven to me and my 1940s fantasies, but the food definitely needs work.  \nWe'll be back once the ball gets rolling --- so far it's retro-cool, comfortable and quiet --- I hope it stays that way!!!

The ambiance is super cute with a vintage vibe. Has the upscale yet unstuffy feeling of a swanky little hidden away place. \n\nService:\nOur waiter was pleasant and offered suggestions that were actually helpful. Knew the menu well could actually chat with us about what was good. Checked on us often without being intrusive. \n\nFood:\nOhhh, it was great. Had the special of grilled sole atop of pesto white beans with a bit of greens. Was a large piece of sole and grilled just right. Light without leaving me hungry. My dinner dates had the kobe beef sloppy joe and the flat iron steak. I'm not a fan of sloppy joe but I would get this next time. Nice shredded beef but not too sweet with extra crunchy fries that I could eat pounds of. Flat iron was cooked to order and surprisingly the garlic brussel sprouts were a delight! I normally loathe them but they were just soft enough to melt in your mouth with the right amount of garlicky goodness. We all shared the apple cobbler. It was good but mediocre. Their drink menu is extensive and offered everything you can think of. If you're a fan of older drinks like negroni's and an old fashioned this is the place for you, they actually know how to make them without asking you for details. \n\nValue:\nGood. Portion sizes are large and pricing reflects a nice evening dinner. Not an everyday place but certainly a monthly dinner spot. \n\nReturn:\nMost definetly. Its fun and a great place to take friends.", "author": "Jen T."}

Fun, long bar inhabited by casual-dress Marina/Pac Hts types. Perhaps a little casual for a Friday night (I mistakenly donned requisite Canali black slacks, Bruno Magli loafers and cobalt blue DKNY dress shirt which would have put me in more comfortable surroundings at Maverick or Myth, but there it is.) We are escorted promptly to our table. No 'wait at the bar' nonsense, even with our 8pm reservation. Menus promptly arrive, echoing a bit of Buckeye Roadhouse meets Fog City Diner nostalgia. I like the short and to-the-point menus. Simple club-like items revised to modern palates.\n\nHaving heard raves about Tim the bartender and his attentive staff behind the granite topped bar, we order a caipirinha (for me), dirty martini (for her). Good solid drinks to be sure (nice hand-crushed fresh fruit mixer in my caipirinha, no Mrs. T nonsense) but felt a little shortchanged on the portion. Granted, perhaps I have gotten used to goblet sized martinis at other establishments that require a spotter to get it to the table without dousing someone with it, but these drinks were positively miniscule. Retro or note, please give me $8 worth of booze please. My caipirinha seemed to have arrived in a shot glass and the lady's martini in a glass so short and tapered I could have mistaken it for the contraption I put my contacts in at night. \nIn any event, we order apps -- combo crab/shrimp cocktail for her, cannibal sandwich for me. The seafood was excellent -- very fresh. But, again, portion size was almost laughable. My cannibal sandwich (a Kobe beef tartare-esque preparation) suited me fine. Into the entree portion of the evening, some stumbles. First, the service. Very erratic. Our server seemed tentative throughout the evening -- unsure of how to describe dishes, and unable to make even basic recommendations. I mis-ordered. Having the Kobe beef app, I asked whether the Sloppy Joes would be repetitive; she said no. I ordered it. Poor choice. Sure the dish was fine as it went, but after the Kobe app why not the veal, or skirt steak, or special fish? Help me out here, please! My server offered me no guidance and I made a poor choice. My companion's veal was nicely seasoned, tender and unremarkable. She HATED my sloppy joes, so I tucked away in silent fuming.\n\nThen dessert. We requested dessert menus...and waited...and waited...and, well you get the point. After 30 mins, I no longer wanted dessert. I wanted the manager and I wanted something comped off the bill for the fits-and-starts food delviery. No such luck. Instead, we got the bill, I ran the card and off we went.\n\nIn all, decent food and an unremarkable evening, but not worth our returning anytime soon.

On Sunday morning I discovered that they booked 2 large parties, one of which was planned for the outdoor patio. The guests refused to sit there and we were moved to the patio. It doesn't appear to be used very much, there are not the standard outdoor heaters, but a long tube that blows hot air. It was freezing outside and very uncomfortable, the staff positioned the huge tube to blow hot air on us, which was equally uncomfortable. I had to ask for complementary Mimosa's; they were not offered. The outdoor patio was bleak, while the indoor area is quite warm and nice. The food was ok. It certainly wasn't worth the 45 minute drive. My friends live close by and enjoy it, I don't know if they will return, but I won't. We should have left....", "author": "Ellen W."}

They are RIGHT. Cool spot, plenty of potential but even at this late date, in Dec. you can book a table any night of the week, you know why? Because it's NOT SO GOOD.First LONG wait for service, food, in betweens. But most of all, not worth the wait. Butter  lettuce salad was all lettuce with maybe one slice of an apple , diced, no flavor. Crab bisque, so bad, no crab or flavor.  Meatloaf, might have been good but it was served black, charcoal burnt, with RAW carrot grated on top, plopped on top of a pile of mashed potatoes. All this was unacceptable, but it was our office Christmas party and I didn't want to complain. It was BAD. Bignetts, get all the raves but they were just donuts, large and puffy, not even  a good dipping sauce.

It wasn't what I expected, but I enjoyed it very much.\nAbsinthe Champagne drink - eeeew. no. If you LOVE absinthe on its own with no sugar, go for it, otherwise steer clear\nBloody Mary - yummy, not as spicy as I'm used to (good for me, but you might not like it that way)\nMimosa - plain but yummy.

The server had a little trouble remembering what was in some of the specials (whether a soup was vegetarian or not and what came with the special). No prices were mentioned for the specials, we had to ask.   I ordered the Brunelle cocktail, I love absinthe, but to pair it with overwhelmingly sour lemon juice which totally overpowered the liqueur?  What was I (and the bartender) thinking?  Blech.  The menu was not very vegetarian friendly. We started with the gruyere points (Pullman bread?), a small, dry, grilled cheese sandwich, cut into four triangles, served with an espresso cup of warm tomato soup for dipping.  It was better than the other appetizer: fried green tomatoes, slightly spicy batter, served with an olive relish and a dollop of ricotta? I thought they were nothing special (first time I'd had them, not sure if they were representative or not).  After a good 25 minute wait, we hungry when we received our entrees.  We ordered the trout on a bed of yellow and green beans. The trout was just shy of overcooked, beans were undercooked, not al dente and cut into tiny  1/2 inch pieces; the lemon half served with the entr\u00e9e was broiled.  Also ordered the Akita salmon special on a bed of succotash ($27), which was good, but the thinner edge of the fillet was just overdone.  We ordered a bottle of Beaujolais which was presented and served correctly.  For afters, we had the chocolate cupcake and white peach sorbet with \"blueberry\" madeleines.   The server overheard us mention we were there celebrating one of our party's birthday; when the desserts arrived, there was a lit candle on the plate with her order (nice understated touch, no singing, thank goodness).  The cupcake (baked to order), arrived as three yummy mini-cupcakes, each with small crunchy chocolate bits baked on top and dusted with confectioners sugar, accompanied by a shot glass containing 1/3 chocolate pudding on the bottom, topped with 2/3 whipped cr\u00e8me.  Chocolate syrup to drizzle over the mini-cupcakes would have worked much better, the pudding didn't add to the dessert at all.  The white peach sorbet (served with blueberry madeleines) was full of peach flavor and made my mouth very happy, the madeleines did not.  Two came with the order, each the size of a quarter with one blueberry baked in the middle, the effect was superfluously meh.   The restaurant was very loud, when the tables were full, it was hard to hear our conversation; when tables turned nearby, we could hear much better.  The lighting could have been brought up a little brighter.  [No we are NOT senior citizens, not that there is anything wrong with that!] The server was very good and brought one member of our party another (comped) cocktail when it was accidently spilled shortly after we were seated.

We brought his parents who were in town visiting. Though we had 8 PM reservations we weren't seated until well after 9.

We were impressed with how he handled things but still hungry and ready to sit down and eat. When we were finally seated at at our table, three of the 4 of us ordered the fish special. Our waiter went to go put the orders in then returned to  inform us there were only two pieces of fish left! When the food finally arrived it was good, not amazing. A number of birthdays were being celebrated at the tables around us - desserts with candles were bring brought out. Though I had called ahead to make sure they would send a dessert over for my boyfriend's birthday, I still got up from the table after dinner and mentioned it to the waiter. He followed me back to the table and awkwardly blurted out, \" You know, I already have all that information, you don't have to tell me anything.\" I was so embarrassed that he said this in front of everyone. I wanted the dessert - which we planned to pay for- to be a surprise. Instead- the waiter left the table, returned with the bill and no dessert!

On the positive side, they have introduced some new items including a pork chop that is very good.  But the negatives outweight the positive:\n\nTheir signature dishes like the mac and cheese and mint peas just aren't as good anymore (the mint peas now taste simply like peas -- we barely touched them -- we mentioned to our server and simply got a shrug of her shoulders).  \n\nThey seem to have raised a lot of prices.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the service has gone downhill.  The hostesses are still great and friendly, but the waitstaff is incredibly rude -- it's like they don't want to be there.  We noticed this with our server on each of our last two visits.  \n\nTimes are tough and people are clammering for restaurant jobs.  My advice to PSC is upgrade your staff and find some people that want to work there and want to treat your patrons well.  Until you do, there are way too many good restaurants in town for us to come back.", "author": "Doug T."}

(and just admit it... even if you don't eat there for any other reason, no one makes fries like mcd's!). i had cod served over corn and clam chowder w/ a side of spinach. my fish was also really good. so good that i saved 1/2 for lunch today, but then my bf left the to-go bag in the car last night and now i'm pretty annoyed i didn't just eat it all then.\n\ndessert was as good as the rest. the cup cakes were really good - and i didn't think they were going to be, especially because they don't have frosting, just whipped cream on the side. but damn those things went down easy! and the meyer lemon tart was sublime.\n\nit was definitely the nicest meal i've had out in the city in a long time.", "author": "eva g."}

We had to ask two separate people if they could take our order, but both said no and that they would let our server know.  20 minutes later.... we were finally greeted.  The food and drinks were slow as well so I'd say that they just need more serving staff and kitchen staff.  I can forgive slow service if it is at least friendly and personable, but alas, it was not. \n\nHash and eggs were good, but a little bland.  Couldn't detect any horseradish, and some of the beets were crunchy and undercooked while others were really soft.  Biscuits and gravy have an awesome spicy gravy which was a little too spicy for one of us, but the rest of us were quite happy with it.  Great selection on the fruit bowl:  mango, figs, peaches, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, & cantaloupe.  \n\nValue is average to perhaps a bit overpriced for what you get.  The bloody mary was average, nothing special, I'd probably recommend trying another of their brunch concoctions instead.

My family has a long history with the Presidio and so when my parents told me to meet them there for Sunday breakfast I thought sure why not. Let me set the scene for you. Beautiful San Francisco Sunday morning, sun shining, nice soft breeze, you couldn't ask for a better day. So I go meet my parents at the PSC and we sit outside on their rear deck area underneath an umbrella (After all I'm delicate I don't want to burn) :) The waitress comes right out and offers me a drink so I have a nice refreshing mimosa and a slice of their oh so delicious cheese toast. Its like a grown up grilled cheese with a luscious little cup of tomato bisque. If that wasn't enough their breakfast was out of this world. Now I'm not sitting here saying its some fabulous french cuisine..Thats not what this place is about. Its about soul quenching, heart warming, home-style goodies that make you feel like you're eating at a friends house. The service here is nothing less then amazing. The crowd is mixed which is refreshing. At any given day (or night) there you'll see families with Lil ones playing with etch a sketches (which by the way they keep on hand) and young couples sitting at the bar enjoying one of their amazing drinks.

There are many things it has to work out before I can call this place a wonderful addition. \n\nFirst the pluses: The location and the room are really nice. They have taken an old army barrack on the old Presidio base and turned it into a great dining area. Some of the food is very well done. The appetizers, soups, salads and sides were wonderful; the desserts were even better. Items to recommend are, gruyere cheese toasts, the soups, whipped potatoes, chocolate pudding and the banana cream pie. \n\nNow the minuses: The main course items left a lot to be desired. Our table had three items and not one was a total winner. The Grilled Calf's Liver was not tender and the seasonings used were all wrong, The Kobe beef rib sloppy Joe was way too sweet for a meat dish.  The \"Broadway and Columbus\" is a clever concept: Chinatown Peking duck over North Beach noodles. The duck was very good but the noodles were drowning in a buttery \"soup\". The wait staff, while well meaning, is very inexperienced.  \n\nThese things in a new restaurant must be corrected or, within eighteen months, we probably will see a new restaurant in this wonderful space. For now, I would say go for the small plates and desserts and skip the main courses. \n\nMy hope is that The Presidio Social Club will make the necessary changes and be a successful restaurant on the SF dining scene.", "author": "Michael R."}

We were told that there was no special fixed price planned and that we would be able to order off the normal menu.  We made our reservation for 8PM, which we thought would give us plenty of time to eat and still meet up with other friends for a NYE celebration. \n\nOur party organizer called on several occasions during late November and early December to increase our reservation size, first from 6 to 8 and then from 8 to 10 and confirm we would still be able to order from the standard menu.  On both occasions, no mention was made of a fixed price menu.  \n\nFast forward to Dec 29th, the party organizer gets a call from PSC to confirm our reservation for 10 people at 8:45PM for a 5 course fixed price dinner at $120 a head with no wine included.   Two days before NYE and we are informed for the first time that our reservation has been moved 45 minutes later and a extremely pricey $120 a head five course dinner has been instituted.  None of use were looking for a large 5 course meal on NYE, that was one of the reasons we went with PSC because we could order off the menu.  Plus, when did PSC start thinking they could charge Gary Danko prices?\n\nAs you can imagine, both these changes would have caused us to miss our larger NYE celebration beginning at 11:30 so we cancelled.  I was really sad and upset that my dinner plans for NYE had to be cancelled two days before NYE.   I called PSC to let them know about my disappointment and sadness, and to let them know that I think that their communication to potential patrons needs to improve.   The manager, Shawn, I spoke with took my call as an opportunity to be defensive and blame everyone except herself and the restaurant for this debacle.  So much for the customer is always right...   In fact, Shawn referred to my party organizer as rude, curt and abrasive and informed me it was her fault that we had to cancel dinner because she didn't get the three messages she left her.   These message were actually never received by the organizer.  \n\nNeedless to say, I consider the practice of the PSC and the manager Shawn to be out of line and completely unprofessional.  As a result, I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone ever again.   It's a shame too because the few times I've eaten at the PSC the food was actually pretty good.", "author": "Stephen D."}

My husband and I went with his parents tonight and, overall, I have to say-- we loved it.  The ambiance was bright and lively, and the menu had something for everyone.  Not as much for vegetarians (I always think, what would my vegetarian Santa Cruz friends eat here?).  But the fresh seasonal veggies and the smashed peas w/mint were both pleasant to the palate.  I shared the Sloppy Joe with my husband which was pretty good... the appetizers (we got the oxtail sliders and the cheese toasts) were more memorable.  After reading prior YELP reviews, I was dismayed that they no longer served fried oysters and that the chocolate cupcakes were taken off the dessert menu.  Bummer.

As every one is saying the decor is charming. Kudos to the designer. Leather banquettes, rustic tables, I don't know what kind of lighting this is. To describe it as bare hanging bulbs sounds bad, but it is not, its warm and lends to the atmosphere. Dishtowel napkins, long marble bar. It was raining and looking inside from outside was warm and busy and cozy. It felt like WW2 British occupied tropics, Colombo perhaps? The bathroom decor I thought suited the place, the sinks were interesting stainless steel trough like, but for a military building appropriate.  I started with the chopped salad with cucumbers and radishes and green goddess dressing. It was nice and crisp and cold and very lightly dressed. I have had many versions of this dressing. This was light and seemed like a mix of ranch and blue cheese and thankfully did not have green food coloring in it. (someone try the wagon wheel in L.A.) My dear friend Erin had the endive salad with egg on top sunny side up. She enjoyed it, I did not taste it being too involved in my own dish. Erin and I shared the beet side dish which was perfect. Red and gold beets, goat cheese, walnuts, very good and lightly dressed. I had the pork chop with spinach. The chop was salty but cooked well with mango chutney chunks on top. I will forgive the salt this time. Erin ordered the Chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken was a large portion and very well herbed and juicy. The potatoes were perfect, creamy, not too seasoned. For desertI had tangerine sorbet and Erin had the cheesecake. We both had the 10 year tawny port. If anyone knows me or Erin, this in one of out most favorite treat's in the world. My sorbet was divine and a perfect palate cleanser. I was so pleased to discover fresh tangerine sections under the sorbet. Without skin. (such a perfect touch) I tasted more than one bite of the cheesecake which was extremely light and fluffy and delicious. The host was very nice and checked on us and made sure our wine was attended to. Our waited was good, he didn't offer an opinion of the menu and said he didn't eat pork, but he served well. We left happy satiated and will return. I would like to try  ore when the menu expands. We were there before the room filled up, I can see that once this happens the service might suffer.", "author": "Amanda L."}

That said, I had a very nice dinner at the Presidio Social Club last night.  The building and decor are great and despite some loud acoustics, it is very well designed.  I really liked that they have a common table and was almost disappointed when we didn't sit there.  Service was friendly, although it was clear that our waiter was not very experienced or comfortable in his role.  But, he worked hard, was polite, and did a pretty good job.  We learned after the meal that the place has only been open six weeks, so given that I think that they are doing a great job and are working out the kinks.  Food was actually great.  We had their special seared scallops, which were good although portion size was small and there was a bit of grit in them, and the flatiron steak, which was great.  Possibly a bit pricey at $19, but I wasn't complaining.  The entree comes with a side and one suggestion for improvement would be to allow the mac&cheese or a green salad as a side (fries, mashed potatoes, etc. are the only options now).  For dessert we had banana creme pie and a Meyer lemon tart, both of which were very tasty.  Nice atmosphere, good food, improving service, and prices still reasonable although pushing pricey.  All told, I probably prefer Pres a Vi, but I think there is room for two good restaurants in the Presidio.", "author": "Brad K."}

It's neighbor, Pres a Vi has a different scene entirely. PSC's decor was minimal, not to say that it was empty. High ceilings, white walls, comfortable. The service was very friendly. Our serve was very sweet\nand enthusiastic that it was our first time eating at PSC. The menu looked diner-like, but was not anything like Mel's. We ordered a few small plates. Crab cupcakes, spinach cream soup, sardines,\nHawaiian style poke, and a butter lettuce salad. I must say it was a very nice meal. The chips for the tuna poke were homemade, and I loved the black wakame seaweed that was mixed in with mangoes. The soup was just right for a cold night. The crab cupcakes were just right, two bites and delicious. Desserts! My friend ordered the cookie plate. We didn't expect much being in the food industry and all, but we gave it a try. Yummie! The macaroons were crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the instead. The Ginger snap was\na rolled cookie- impressive, the caramel with sweet and buttery, the chocolate cookie was moist and a nice ending to our meal. I ordered the brioch beignets . I am a total sucker for anything with the word beignets on them- savory or sweet Sarah's gotta have it when she's out.  I was pleasantly surprised. Eclair shaped donuts that were delicately placed on a cloth napkin without a speck of oil on it. Dusted genetly with baker's sugar (something less course than granulated). There was a little ramekin next to these delicious morsels of yummieness. Syrup! We got to dip the beignets in sweet comforting syrup! What a hit! I ate three!! My friend had one. We stayed after our dessert plates were taken away and the staff did not mind that we stayed it chat for at least another 30 minutes. PSC has a SF feel, very comfortable, a hidden spot in the Presidio that I will be going back to soon.\n\nP.S. There's PARKING! Big plus in the city.", "author": "Lisa J."}

That was nice.  I did love my food though.  I had an asparagus salad to start, steak, and beignets for dessert.  Boyfriend had the gruyere cheese toasts w/ tomato fondue, kobe beef sloppy joes, and banana pie.  Yes, we were hungry.  On another visit, it seemed like some kinks were worked out.

The post-industrial look of the place would make you think it was loud and cold but the acoustics were really good. Oh yea, and the food. All I have to say is Kobe beef sloppy joe.  Everyone who reviews the place says it and yes, it is that good - if you like that sort of thing, of course. But what is not to like about delicious messy amazing meat and sauce sammy?  The other more more traditional options are really good too. Highly reccommended for big group dining, or a date night.  Nice ambiance and free parking.

The space is great, not hard to find (as long as you enter through the Lombard gate, I've lived in SF for almost 5 years and have gotten turned around in the Presidio more times than I care to admit to), parking (yay!), upscale diner ambience.  Beautiful marble bar (FYI, in case anyone was wondering, those metal cabinets behind the bar were reclaimed when the Letterman Hospital was demolished).  In January they hadn't been open for very long and the service reflected that.  Gruyere cheese points with tomato fondue, trout with almond butter, flat iron steak - these were all good but I save really freakin' good for the cocktails and the chocolate cupcakes - oh my goodness, the chocolate cupcakes!  Do not be fooled by the crab \"cupcake\" appetizer (call them what they are people - Superball sized rounds of crab!).  That's no cupcake size!  The service was slightly better this time.  I know they're famous for the mac & cheese which my dining companion had on the most recent trip - I failed to see what the hoo ha was about.  I could make better and I'd be happy to throw down if anyone wanted to challenge me.   A personal nit - the hostess who seated us.  Honey, your breasts are quite lovely and I honestly couldn't tell if they were implants or your new pushup bra but they do not add to my dining pleasure.

With the exception of my friends and I, the restaurant was basically deserted. The only other party there was an out of town crew, that turned out to be the guests from hell. Granted the waitress did accidentally spill Mimosas on on of the guests. It appeared to have not only RUINED her hair, outfit, Prada bag, and day, but also destroyed her father-in-law's birthday breakfast. It was quite the scene. The poor waitress was mortified and ran away crying. The breakfast was good. I had, the omelette that they were serving. Decently cooked, good sides (honestly, I can't remember what the sides were.) My friend got the bourbon french toast, excellent and bigger than her head. The menu per se was limited (kind of a bummer,) and it seemed like it is not a well-known breakfast destination.

So if that is important to you then go.  If you want good food at decent prices dont waste your time.\n\nThe food is WAY WAY WAY over priced and very boring.  On top of that the staff was very unaccomodating to our needs.  Specifically the person I was with asked for a simple substitution of a vegatable that came with the dish they wanted.  They didnt like the vegatable that it was served with and wanted another one of the vegatables that they offered on the menu to replace the one they didnt like.  The vegetable they asked for was LESS expensive than the one that the dish came with so the restaurant could not even say that the substitution changed the price of the dish.  The waitress told us the Chef would not do that and if they didnt want the vegatable they would be happy to serve the dish to them without a vegetable.   Talk about horrible customer service.  Are you kidding?  I do give the waitress credit as she told us not to order the dish that way and recommended another dish.  She was apologetic and we understood it was not her fault and the Chef was the one to blame.\n\nThe food itself was average at best.  This was the second time I have been there and it was equally as average and overpriced the last time.  Not much has changed in a year or so.  Because of the parking situation and the nice retro feel the place has its not a bad place to meet friends for a get together so long as the company is more important to you than the food.  \n\nThe bottom line on this place is that there are so many other options in this city where there is better food, better service and at much more reasonable prices.", "author": "Jeff S."}

LOVE the modern take on the grilled cheese and tomato soup (i'm such a sucker for buttery wonderbread sandwiches with gooey kraft sliced cheese and campbell's mmm mmm good soup, and these are such an UPGRADE).  the butter lettuce salad was perfectly dressed w/ a champagne dijon vinaigrette, and the sweet-tart nectarines added just the perfect contrasting bit of freshness.  i debated between the flat iorn steak w/ french fries and the broiled trout w/ almond butter and spinach, and opted for the \"healthier\" fish choice - little did i know that it would be so rich w/ butter, both the trout and the spinach!  but it was oh so tasty - i love fish that is simply prepared, and the spinach was to die for - i don't know that their secret is, but they managed to make simple sauteed spinach taste as rich as creamed spinach w/o the cream!

When I complained to the manager, she was apologetic, yet disappeared for another 10 minutes. I went again to track her down and she said they were making more coffee -- uh, moot point.

I guess the moral of the story is to not try to go here with a group.  Someone else reviewed earlier and described an attempt to have a New Year's Eve party here ... but they saved themselves and cancelled before NYE after lots of rules were imposed.  We showed up to our group event ... forced to be there at 6 on a Saturday ... some showed up late ... a few did not show up at all, and we were charged full price for 4 non existent people.  The same type of blaming of our organizer by the Manager Lady, it was all our fault, etc etc -- same as those NYE folks occurred.  So...if we have to pay $200 extra, can we take the food they would have eaten home?  NO.  This is unfortunate ... you know that 10 people who just ate here (and paid an extra $100 or so on mac and cheese?! and tons on drinks and other extras) will probably never come back and would never recommend this place to anybody else?  I'M FINE WITH THAT.  Yikes ... as I walked away, she called out \"AND THANKS FOR SHOWING UP ON TIME.\"  Wow.  We probably left around 9, and the place was not packed at all.  Maybe we were not the best guests, but there was probably 500 different ways this could have been handled so that there were no lingering hard feelings.  I feel like I did something horrendous, but all I did was eat a real simple dinner for which I gave them a ton of money.  Maybe you will have a better experience.  Just show up on time, dammit.", "author": "Cole P."}
