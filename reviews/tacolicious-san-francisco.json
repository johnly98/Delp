I couldn't have asked for a better Mexican experience than what I got at Tacolicious. The atmosphere is cool, hip, and modern but still gives the feel of a classic family establishment. When I walked in I immediately felt the joy and passion the employees had working there. It seemed as if everyone was enjoying life to the fullest and loving their meals and drinks even more.\n\nA minimum requirement for a good Mexican joint is an extensive selection of mezcals and tequilas and Tacolicious did not disappoint. Classic drinks such as micaeladas were also available in addition to a variety of Mexican beers. \n\nThe menu was full of everything you can imagine from simple tacos with gourmet sauces to tortas and fajitas that everyone can enjoy. I ordered the cod tacos and was pleased to taste the cool creme mixed with the warm, fresh fish. The house salsa was like I've never had before, a traditional tomato base but with an unexpected yet welcoming sweet finish. I wish I could have taken it to go!\n\nIf you're ever considering Mexican in the port area of San Fran, look no further, Tacolicious has got you covered!", "author": "Kashiff M."}

They had a good bit of meat on them as well, but they were pretty pricey at $5.50 a taco. If you go with a group, you can get 10 tacos for $43 or 4 for $20. \n\nThe service was subpar. We asked one waiter that was not ours for refill on water and they never came back. It took us quite a while for our waitress to return to get more water which was disappointing. \n\nThe spot is great on Chesnut and they had good outdoor seating.

Yes, it was artfully broken into 3 pieces and grilled with blackened bits and topped with a sprig of cilantro but it was still ..a single ear of corn. Keep in mind, this wasn't Mexican street corn, just an ear of grilled corn.\n\n$7 for a tiny bowl of black beans. It was billed \"Black midnight beans\" to make it sound special but it was 7-8 oz of black beans and no, I couldn't taste any oregano or garlic. That's a half can of beans. For $7.\n\nTacos were pricy at (4) for $20. Small but with quality ingredients, each one was tasty and we ordered a mix: Pastrami, chicken, skirt steak and Baja style. It was $2 extra to upgrade to the steak and pastrami options.\n\nA tray of attractively plated sauces accompanied our tacos but no one explained what they were. \n\nHorchata was excellent with bits of undissolved cane sugar and delicious cinnamon. The margarita picante hit the spot and had just the right amount of heat.\n\nService was sweet and apologetic especially about the overpriced sides but given its inflated pricing, I'd have to be pushed back in the door to Tacolicious.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

The Pastrami Taco. \nMy mouth is watering just thinking about it! As we sat eating our two pastrami tacos, conversation melded into moaning and grunting noises and we experienced the flavors of this amazing dish. I have never had anything like it. We wept at the fact we could not go back and get more because the business had already closed. It was the best taco we have ever tasted!\nTheir amazing customer service, coupled with the delicious flavors of that taco easily entitle them to 5 stars.

This area is super dog friendly so you'll see a lot of dogs pass by during your time there\n- metered parking is $4.75-$5.50 an hour so try to find hourly parking a few blocks away to avoid paying massive parking fees.

Although I was sad to see The Grove leave which I loved, I'm so happy that Tacolicious filled the space.\n\nI love Mexican food and crave it all the time so I eat here often.  The food and drinks are so consistent and so DELICIOUS, and the atmosphere is more fun than any restaurant in the Marina.  Regarding drinks, I can't tell you how many restaurants (and I eat out a lot) make terrible margaritas in SF. I'd say the majority of other restaurants make bad margaritas. Tacolious makes AMAZING margaritas made with fresh daily lime juice and fresh agave. The classic is fabulous, and I also love the spicy passion fruit margarita as well.\n\nThe produce at Tacolicious is locally sourced which I really appreciate, and they use paper straws which is a small but environmentally impactful choice and detail that I also appreciate.  I've had everything on the menu so it's hard to pick a favorite, but I do especially love the ceviche and carnitas.  The chips are my favorite in the city. It's also amazing how many bad chips there are at other restaurants.  Tacolicious has perfected these.  I love them!\n\nMy favorite thing about the staff is the manager Mickey. If only more restaurants had managers like him. He has every quality that makes a fabulous manager. He loves his work and the customers, he is very seasoned (has worked for some of the very top SF restaurants), he works hard, and he really cares about teaching and supporting his employees.  If he ever leaves, I'm not sure I'll want to keep going to Tacolicious. That's how important and necessary I think he is.  If you ever were to have a problem, do not blast off an unfair review here without giving them a chance to address it. Talk to Mickey. He will always make it right.  BRAVO Mickey for being the BEST!\n\nI have also had 2 parties in the private dining room upstairs, and they were both wonderful!  The room is so cool, and the food and staff were amazing as always!

Walked in, put together a table for a rather larger party of ours, and made sure we were served our menus and chips and salsa shortly afterwards. Water was consistently refilled, and for busy restaurants like these, this is usually an oversight.\n\nChips were crispy and thick. I prefer this because I like to dip my chips in an overwhelmingly amount of salsa that if the chip is thin, it breaks. Ain't about that brittle life! Salsa was not watery and more of a mild sauce than salsa. Very tasty.\n\nOk now onto the Ensalada Chingaderas. Lemme break it down. This is essentially a grains bowl with barley as the main grain and the salad being chopped kale. I am a huge fan of this bowl. I enjoy trying various types of grains, and barley has this juiciness because of its larger volume. I've only had barley in soups, so I worried that the barley would be too dry in a salad. This was not the case! I think it had to do with the kale being CHOPPED kale, like baby kale. None of them dry stems and dry leafy leaves (ugh, why do people enjoy this?). Chopped kale is the bizness. There was a wonderful touch of sweetness with the sliced peaches and a surprising crunch with the toasted quinoa and charred corn. Mmmm mm! Devoured in 10 minutes. The only downside is that they added a bit too much dressing - next time ask for it on the side.\n\nOverall, I like the vibe of this place. A full bar, TV playing, lots of seating and good for groups. Would definitely come back here to try other things on their menu (like taocs, duh) and for their drinks.

Sucks because the atmosphere was really amazing. With a name like Tacolicious, I was expecting to receive the most amazing tacos here. Unfortunately, it was anything but. \n\nAfter roaming around the city and driving down Lombard street, a friend and I had worked up quite an appetite. We were in the Marina district and decided to try out Tacolicious for taco Tuesday. When we walked in, I was instantly enamored by the whole setup! The bar was set right in the middle of the room and was surrounded by tables. It's really open, making it feel super comfortable and breathable. The crowd was pretty lively and the music was a bit loud for my taste. It was almost 11 pm, so I kind of expected it. \n\nOur server Talia seated us and gave us a menu. They had a taco Tuesday special going on which consisted of 6 ground beef crispy tacos for $15. Although it sounded appealing, we opted for something with more variety. We decided to do the 4 tacos for $18. We chose the guadillo-braised beef brisket, Baja-style pacific cod, chicken in mole Colorado, and the hangar steak. We skipped drinks and just settled for waters, as we had already been drinking earlier that night. As we waited for our tacos, we munched on the complimentary chips and salsa. Now THOSE were actually really tasty! Nice crispy flour tortillas chips that tasted hand made along with a spicy red salsa that had an amazing flare of jalape\u00f1o. \n\nOur tacos arrived, and what a mess it was! Visually, they weren't even very appealing. They were sloppily put together with tons of juice and grease oozing out of the sides and onto the plates. The fish taco was the only one that was quite decent in my opinion. It was a little soggy, but flavor wise, it wasn't too bad. As for the others... no flavor what so ever. The chicken was super greasy and needed way more spice. The steak was extremely tough and overcooked and the beef was the absolute worst! It literally tasted like I was eating raw beef from the package! Cold and completely flavorless! They barely put any toppings on it, which might have helped just a tad at least. We used the four additional salsas that they provided,  but nothing at that point could save those tacos. I was left so unimpressed and it was definitely not for $18 in any sense! \n\nDespite the horrible food, the service from Talia was wonderful! She checked in on us multiple times and refilled our water glasses. It's just too bad, because I really enjoyed the environment. I didn't have any of their drinks, so I can't comment on that.

Tacos will cost you about $4-5 per taco depending on how many you get. If you have a group and get 10 for $40 bucks; it's cheapest per taco. Although they are pricey per taco, they're pretty filling; they don't scrimp on the beef or carnitas. The cod taco is pretty good but this time it wasn't crispy. The veggie one which is butternut squash was unexpectedly good. \n\nTried their horchata cold brew for the first time during lunch. It was pretty good but I saw no cinnamon residue so was concerned if they use real cinnamon and just blend it real well or if it's a syrup flavoring instead. \n\nTheir carnitas and beef tacos are the best. We went to Saturday brunch so they had the chilaquiles to share for the table which was pretty good! Whatever red sauce they put on was so good...garlicky and salsa-y and really good. The 5 of us were pretty full with the shared chilaquiles and 2 tacos a piece. There were even a little bit of leftovers. \n\nWait is decent...around 30-40 at a given time. Put your name down and go shop or walk around. They typically text you way before the actual quoted time though.", "author": "Melissa L."}

This is the review that was meant for this location: \n\nGod, this place is good. I went here during last summer when I was visiting San Fran. I got the Fish, Carnitas, and Short Rib Tacos. Each one was love at first bite. Some of the best tacos I've had. The short rib and carnitas were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. The fish tacos reminded me of the ones I had in Cancun and took me to a happy place. As for drinks, I ordered the Pasion and it was unlike anything I've ever had. A spicy kick to an otherwise fruity drink. Just my kind of thing. \n\nDefinitely on my must-go list once I'm in San Fran again!\n\n\n\nPS. I went to their other location on Valencia Street a month ago and posted a review for it. Still the best tacos I've ever had.", "author": "Sargam B."}

I don't know if they only have 2 servers on board for the day but seriously..?! I understand, I work in the business of hospitality. But to not even ask me how my food is, when I'm clearly picking at it.. is beyond me. Take a hint! I ordered the fried avocado taco. First of all, this wasn't even a quarter of an avo. For $6, I expected a little more. Their salads are weird too. 2 of them are so bland (straight up tomato sauce) and the other one is some weird smoky habenero which overpowers any flavor on your plate. \nI really wanna like you guys, but your flavors really lack.

Right when you sit down you are served tortilla chips and house made salsa. The mint in the salsa was throwing me off. Had the chicken and shredded beef tacos. The tacos cone with in house taco sauces- mild to habenero spicy. All the sauces were delicious. The tacos needed some help. The chicken was good and the beef was manly. You might laugh, but just to have a hunk of meat in a taco shell really doesn't scream tacoliscious to me. A taco, like a sandwich needs to be built right. There needs to be some sort of fresh element in order to balance the meat, like cilantro, lettuce, tomato, etc. Unfortunately neither taco had this so it was just blazay. The watermelon chili shots were delicious though. And the chiros were o.k. a bit dry... sad to say I would only come back for more of those shots.", "author": "Allie P."}

While these were good they were a little too greasy for me (the shells tasted as if they were deep fried in oil and then they forgot to soak up the extra grease). My friends and my sister got way better looking tacos since they ordered individual ones off of the menu (each one $4.95 and could get 4 for $17.95). They got things like carnitas, mushroom sofritas, carne asada, and chorizo which all looked like much better options all served on soft corn tortillas. \n\nI would definitely recommend ordering the individual tacos, which are a good size (2-3 tacos per person is a good amount) instead of getting the hard tacos.", "author": "Gabby U."}

Delicious tacos (with interesting fillings); creative margaritas; and always a lively scene.\n\nThis time around, I was a tad disappointed with my lunch. It was the first time I had dined at their new Chestnut Street location. I found no fault with the new space (what used to be the popular Grove Cafe). It's much more inviting and with much more seating the previous location. Getting a table for two at lunchtime was not a problem at all. And everyone from our hostess to our server was super friendly.\n\nI guess what disappointed me this time around was the food. For starters, the chips and salsa (a staple of any Mexican restaurant) were so bland and flavorless. The chips, in particular, did not taste fresh at all. I decided to indulge in an adult beverage while I waited for my friend, so I ordered the Margarita Picante (silver tequila, lime, agave, and red chili shrub). As anyone who knows me knows, I love me some tequila beverages, especially ones with a little heat/kick. Unfortunately, this drink was WAY too spicy and unbalanced. It gave me heartburn after just 3 spicy sips. I wound up not finishing it, and just sticking with water.\n\nWhen my friend arrived, we shared three tacos (the guajillo-braised beef brisket; the chicken en mole colorado; and the shot-and-a-beer braised chicken). I'd say that the best one was the braised chicken taco. It paired well with the three sauces that came with it. The beef brisket taco was surprisingly oily and greasy. It would've been nice to mix it with some cheese, sour cream, or something sweet. Something was just off.\n\nAt the end of the day, it wasn't a bad meal by any means. It just wasn't really a memorable one. Also, 3 tacos, one undrinkable margarita, and a diet coke somehow cost me $43 + tip. $50 seems like a pretty steep price tag for a mediocre/fast-casual lunch (even by Bay Area standards). Maybe it was just an off-day for them. I'll def give Tacolicious another chance if I'm ever back in the neighborhood.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Originally, I was more invested in visiting a different location but the reviews of this place were too alluring to miss out. We went on July 4th right before the fireworks, so there was virtually no wait. We had a party of 6 and we were seated right away. \n\nOur server, Rosalind was wonderful. She was so nice and accommodating. She made great suggestions and was super attentive. We started the meal with a guac and chips. The guac was a huge hit with our group, we eventually ordered another one. It was a little onion potent, and a lot smoother than my normal favorite guacs, but I still loved it. \n\nFor dinner we all ordered combinations of tacos. I don't love how he ordering process works because there is no happy medium between the 10 tacos and the 4 tacos. It would be cool of there was an option for 7 or 8. My boyfriend and I split 10 and we couldn't even finish them! They were small but packed with flavor and filling. The best tacos were definitely the brisket, I should have just ordered 5 brisket. The chicken tacos were borderline flavorless compared to the brisket, and the cod was okay but too stuffed with cabbage. In the future I will order the brisket only. \n\nOne of the greatest things that happened on this visit was the accommodations they made when I ordered a drink I didn't like. I ordered the passion first, which has a spicy habanero tequila. I do like spicy stuff but this drink was sooo spicy it burnt my esophagus. I tried to muscle through it because there was nothing wrong with it, if anything it just didn't suit my palette. Our server noticed I was hardly drinking it and questioned whether I liked it. When I told her it was too spicy she happily replaced it with the mucho gusto for free and allowed our table to keep the passion. I have been to many restaurants in DC and New York where the places refused to refund a drink and if they do they never let the table keep the drink - they would rather pour it out. I found Tacolicious and our server to be super classy in this way, because the drink did not go to waste at our table. \n\nOverall, I thought this place was great and I would definitely return in the future. Definitely order the brisket tacos. They are mind-blowing.", "author": "Nicole C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-08", "description": "Trendy crowd & trendy eateries with outdoor seating... & hello, we've arrived in the Marina. \nTacos aren't my favorite, unless they're crunchy. I love Mexican food, but I'll take a burrito or a quesadilla over a taco. Tacos with their flimsy tortillas, and filling falling every which way doesn't make my life easier. Plus, they usually don't fill me up unless I have about 5. When I factor in the cost per taco, I might as well get 1 burrito.\nSame story here at Tacolicious. There's also the added benefit that they cost more than your average taco. However, they do have a nice selection of tasty taco fillings.\n\nThey start you off with some complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was quite robust, with smokey and mesquite flavors.\n\nTaco Prices (currently)\n$4.95 for 1 (a little pricey. I want to say tacos average $3-ish?)\n$17.95 for 4\n$39.95 for 10\n\nTacos are served with a trio of salsas & 3 snazzy wooden spoons. \n- chipotle salsa - mesquite (dark red) \n- avocado tomatillo - smooth, almost milky salsa verde (green)\n- habanero - spicy (yellow)\n\nThe size of the tacos are average and have a good amount of filling in each one. They line them up in a row to keep the tortillas from falling flat. The tortillas seem steamed and with the amount of moisture from the filling on top of the tortillas, it made the tortillas feel really wet, almost soggy. Some of them felt like they were ready to tear. Good thing each taco is lined with 2 tortillas.\n\nThe lighting is pretty dark, so I could barely tell which taco was which. It's also loud, so I couldn't really hear our waiter explain which taco was which. That doesn't really matter, because some of the tacos tasted like they were seasoned the same way, so there wasn't much differentiation in flavor either.\n\nThe Traditional Carnitas & Guajillo-Braised Beef Short Rib were quite tasty.\nThe Shot-and-a-Beer Braised Chicken was okay, a little dry. Couldn't resist ordering it for the silly name.\nThe Fried Rock Cod had sweet, tender white fish under some heavy batter.\nThere was a Filet Mignon in the mix, but I couldn't tell which through all the spices and heavy seasoning. I believe it was the one with the caramelized onions. Not bad, not great.\nWe also ordered one with grilled vegetables that was really good and sweet. I think there were roasted eggplants in it. \n\n$12.95 Albacore Tuna Tostadas Contramar-Style - chipotle mayo, avocado, crispy leeks:\nBest taco of the bunch to me. The toppings lie on top of fried tortillas, so you eat it as if you are inserting a small disc into your mouth. The chipotle mayo acts as the glue that keeps the tuna and everything else in tact on top of the tortilla, while also giving it a good taco flavor. It wasn't the most attractive, vibrant-looking tuna, but the texture was smooth and meaty. The most color on the plate came from the creamy slivers of avocado. The best part of the taco was the crunchy fried leeks. \nVery delicious, but pricey for ~$6.50 each. It's not a must-have, since you can get some rendition of this at an Asian restaurant on top of a fried wonton, probably at a lower price point.\n\nI also had some grilled corn once, which was okay, but also overpriced. \nAlso had the margarita flight, which was pretty good. They were served in shooter glasses with salt on the rim. I wasn't a fan of the habanero tequila. \n\nAfter a couple of visits, I conclude that this is a decent taco place. But I didn't love anything, nor do I feel enticed to make a return visit, especially since the last time I was here it was crowded and there were people waiting outside on a windy day.

But unfortunately, our most recent visit was super off-putting. \n\nWe were stoping in for a quick dinner during Happy Hour. Waiting for our table (coincidentally plenty of tables were open but they refused to seat us until Happy Hour just happened to be wrapping up), we chose to get a quick drink at the bar. Right before it turned 6, when Happy Hour finishes, the table that had been actually been open for 30 minutes was now ready to seat us. \n\nWe asked for another drink since we knew it would be awhile until they were able to serve us once we were seated considering it can be slow. We instantly were judged in front of the entire bar staff for trying to get another drink during happy hour. We aren't 20 year-olds trying to take advantage of a drink deal - we really don't care to save $2 on a margarita - instead had been waiting for awhile and simply wanted another drink. It was so strange and unwelcomed. Being questioned alongside our neighbors and friends was a rookie move. It was 5:50 on a Friday, give us a break. \n\nReally bummed to have to write this as we have always loved going here with our family and friends. The bar staff was so rude it was actually shocking.

Although a little pricy, Tacolicious really satisfies my taste buds.\n\nI've come here twice now, and both times have been very busy. I was able to get an indoor seat the first time around, but yesterday, I came at around 7pm, and the indoor wait was 45 minutes while outdoors was 20 minutes. Outdoor seating is quieter, and there are cozy outdoor heaters for warmth. If you want to have a conversation, choose outdoor seating, because at night, it gets loud and crowded indoors.\n\nAs for food, the warm complimentary chips and salsa are amazing! I couldn't get enough of it. Yesterday, my friend and I ordered 10 tacos for $33: pork (2), beef (4), cod (2), shrimp (2) and a glass of sangria. Everything was good but I'd have to say the pork was the best, followed by the beef. I was so full after my fourth taco.\n\nService was great and attentive despite a busy night, and food was delicious. I've only had good experiences here so far.", "author": "Corinna T."}

They don't take reservations so you'll probably have to put your name down and grab a drink at the bar or a neighboring bar. The tacos are kinda pricey but you're more there to be seen than anything. \n\nThey provided you with complimentary chips/ salsa for starters. Hands down to the Salsa, one of the best I've tried after eating at hundreds of Latin influenced restaurants. \n\nOur main course were tacos, of course. We had the in shot and a beer braised chicken, traditional carnitas, Baja style pacific cod, chicken mole Colorado and the guajillo braised short-ribs. They also served it with three sauces: the salsa from before, a guacamole, and a sweet yellow sauce I couldn't put my finger on. All three were good. The Baja style pacific cod definitively stole the show. The rest were drier than anticipated, but still tasty.\n\nGreat place to go out with a group to enjoy food with great ambiance.", "author": "Portia S."}

The complimentary chips & salsa were very good & addicting! The chips were thick&crunchy, and the salsa had a nice kick to it. \n\nStarters: Albondigas en Chipotle(pork&beef meatballs,roasted tomato chipotle sauce, cotija cheese) - delicious & flavorful. I would cut the meatballs in half&soak the half in the tomato chipotle sauce,which added that nice extra flavor. \n\nMain: 4 tacos (bf had the nopales&oaxaca cheese & pacific cod/I had the guajillo braised beef short rib & pacific cod) - the beautiful presentation&smell of the food looked promising, but sadly, it did not live up to its expectation. Both tacos tasted bland. The beef short rib was soaked in the guajillo chili sauce, yet there wasn't any flavor. I had to douse it in the green salsa jst to get some flavor. For the pacific cod, it was fried really well&tasted fresh, yet again, it lacked flavor to which I had to douse it in the green salsa again. Also, the tortilla was overpowering the cod that I had to take off one layer.\n\nOverall, tacos were pretty disappointing.

Their popular dishes are the tacos - 1 for $4.95 / 4 for $17.95 / 10 for $39.95. For the price of ONE taco, you can probably get 2-4 more elsewhere for the same price. They also offer snacks, chupitos (sold in 4, 8, and 12), sides, a special \"taco of the week\", and desserts. \n\nMy bf ordered (4) \"baja style\" pacific cod (4 for $17.95). This dish comes with cabbage and cumin crema. The only \"fish\" taco in the menu, this taco was meh. The fish was good, but eating it with the tortilla, you can only taste the tortilla and hardly the fish.

At $4 a taco, you can't help but expect it to be pretty bomb, right? Well I was disappointed to say the least. \n\nThe short rib taco was decent, but mine were so wet that they soaked through the tortilla. It also had a sweet hint to it (bc it was guajillo braised I guess), which I personally do not enjoy in my taco. \n\nThe shot & a beer chicken taco was my favorite. The chicken was tender and went great with the mild sauce. \n\nThe fish taco was okay, but I've had better. The size of the filet was pretty generous though. \n\nMy boyfriend had the filet mignon taco which cost $3 extra. It was supposed to come with caramelized onions but the onions looked like they were barely grilled- closer to raw. He didn't even want to finish it because the meat was too tough and dry. \n\nAnd with the service, I think that it's too loud and dark in there for the waiters to even notice the customers. My boyfriend had to flag down two waiters to get the check. However, the hostess that seated us was very friendly. \n\nFor tacos, this restaurant is pretty overpriced. My party got 17 tacos with no appetizers/cocktails and the total was $75. Think about what you could do with $75. Probably 75 tacos from a taco truck!\n\nOverall, 3 stars because I enjoyed the chicken taco and the dipping sauces that came with it. But I'll probably get my taco fix from somewhere else next time.", "author": "Marny N."}

Transferred our bar tab over too.\n\nHouse margarita: excellent! There was plenty of tequila in there...\n\nStarted with guac, which was realllllly good. Then we got 10 tacos for the 4 of us, which was plenty of food after the guac and drinks. They came really nicely presented too! I went with what seemed to be the most popular: short rib, carnitas, cod. The carnitas is \"the best one\" according to the waitress. I liked the short ribs a little better, but they were both juicy, fresh, and delicious. The cod was really tasty - a bit greasy as it is fried. My girlfriend loved the veggie tacos as well. They bring out a number of sauces as toppings. The yellow habenero sauce is SPICY, but really good. I mistakenly put too much on at first and went reaching for my marg class. Careful.\n\nGreat service, and really tasty tacos. Good atmosphere too!

Do go if you are looking for a DELICIOUS, reasonably priced meal, full of flavor and with high-quality ingredients.\n\nTacolicious is not a $1 taco el cheapo crap shack.  They have a very interesting and well-balanced menu featuring a number of different tacos (standards like 'carnitas' as well as their own creations such as a filet mignon & veggie tacos and specials of the week...) as well as many other non-taco items- salads, sides, great guacamole, salsas, sauces, etc...My personal favorite item on the menu regularly is the tuna tostada.  This dish features two generous albacore cuts (raw) on a flat/circular taco shell accompanied with a slice of fresh avocado, spicy mayo, and fried shallots...awesome - a MUST order.  My other favorite item is from their drink menu- be brave and try the passion margarita- it comes flavored with habanero and packs a punch!\n\nAnyways, there is a reason Tacolicious is ALWAYS packed.  The food is great.  For those so inclined, I've ordered a few times using their on-line take-out system, and it works smoothly and my food has been ready every time with little or no wait.  Enjoy Tacolicious for what it is- a source of great food- but don't bash it for not being a 'traditional' Mexican restaurant.

There taco Tuesday specials drew a large crowd, as it should be. But it seemed quite disorganized, by seating people that arrived later than me and my girlfriend. \n\nOnce we were seated though we ordered the $12 \"make your own tacos\" deal. It came with ground beef (cannot choose other meats), lettuce, chopped tomatoes, cheese, some sort of sauce that resembled Tabasco's smoked flavor, and 6 corn tortilla. They give complementary tortilla chips and salsa (spicy). It was an overall decent meal, but not truly worth the $12 in my eyes. It was too Americanized for my taste buds.\n\nBut I believe the reason I give it a low number of stars is due to the seasoning of the ground beef. It was to bland in flavor and didn't remind me of classic/authentic Mexican style tacos. Another reason was the price of guacamole which is just shy of $10 and the amount served should only warrant a price that isn't over $5.\n\nSo in all I believe if you look for authentic Mexican style tacos, across the street might be a safer bet.

Let's be honest, this is not real mexican food, and I love the real stuff, but tacolicious is an americanized twist of their own, which is fun if you are looking for something different! It has a cool atmosphere (yes it's loud, so don't go for a romantic dinner), nice for a drink and some tacos, haven't tried anything else besides all their tacos, their queso and guacamole. Their tacos are definitely overpriced, but they come with a lot of meat in them. First time we went there we ordered 8 tacos for the two of us and my husband was so full that we only ate 7 of them (keep in mind that he is someone who usually orders 6 tacos in a regular mexican hole in the wall). So yeah, it may look expensive but the tacos come loaded! Also they keep refilling your chips and salsa which is complimentary, and considering how delicious their salsa is you end up eating too much chips and salsa. their salsa is not spicy at all, again this is not the real mexican restaurant, but it has a mint twist in it which makes it amazing and refreshing. All their salsas that come with the taco are pretty boring, I honestly just use the regular salsa over my tacos!

Don't get me wrong, they are hot but unless you're on your way to the Gold's Club, Crazy Horse, or to the AVNs, please stop making the rest of us jelly. \n\nAnd to the pompous fellas, \"I went to Yale...\" is NOT an effective pick-up line.

This isn't a normal spot that I'd frequent, but I was down to check it out since it was chosen as a meeting place for a group lunch.  As usual on a weekend, the Marina was bustling with people out and about.  Tacolicious was no exception.  We arrived before 1pm and snagged the last open table for our party of 5.  It was a bit of a tight squeeze as the restaurant has is a small space.  The tables are quite close to one another and bar seating is limited.  They have outside seating on the sidewalk, which looked a bit crowded as well.  Note that there's only one unisex restroom (and it was clean).  \n\nTwo large baskets of chips and salsa were placed on our tables right after we sat down.   You can really fill up on the chips alone!  Our group decided to order an assortment of 15 tacos and a pitcher of margarita.  I tried three tacos deemed to emulate Mexican street tacos with an American twist.  \n- Fried rock cod taco: The piece of fish was quite large and fried crispy golden brown.  Can't say it was that flavorful without adding salsa.  \n- Shot and a beer braised chicken taco: Topped with lots of shredded chicken in plenty of sauce.  Don't remember anything else about it besides being saucy and spicy.\n- Guajillo braised short rib taco:  Taco was a bit wet from the chili oil.  The beef was plentiful but nothing special. \n- Paloma Fillmore Margarita: If you like grapefruit juice and lots of tequila, you'll enjoy this! \nTotal tab including tip was $110.  Overall, the tacos are OK. It is what it is.  I don't think it would be fair to compare to authentic Mexican food.  You have to go to Tacolicious and almost expect that you're getting wannabe tacos and willing to pay more for the service and ambiance.  The tacos were filling and each of us were pretty stuffed by the end of our meal.  They do make a mean margarita. \n\nOn our way out, there was a large crowd waiting to be seated.  I overheard the hostess telling someone that the wait would be an hour and 15 min.  I, personally don't think it's worth the wait.  However, I can see how Tacolicious is a popular place for groups.

The reason I am just now writing a review is because we have been thoroughly disappointed every time we have dined here since they moved the location further down Chestnut Street. The food and drinks are still GREAT, but has the management and/or staffing changed? I only recognize a couple of the waiters and bartenders from the other location.\n\nService has been pretty terrible the 4 times we have been here since the move. It has taken about 10-15 minutes every time before a waiter has come to our table to ask if we would like a drink and then it takes another at least 10 minutes to get the drinks. Once the drinks didn't come until after we received our meals. We thought that maybe they were a little overwhelmed with the high volume of customers but we just visited again on a Tuesday around 5pm, and there were maybe 10 other people dining there. Same super slow service. Empty drinks sitting in front of us for 15 minutes before anyone asked if we wanted another and when my husband ordered a 2nd it took another 15 minutes before he received it. All the while the staff is just hanging out with each other around the bar talking and goofing around with each other. \n\nLike I said already, quality of food and drinks is still amazing, but service needs to be brought back to the level it used to be at otherwise I'm afraid we may not be coming back anymore.", "author": "Stacey N."}

After leaving work early to be sure to make HH (ends at 5:30pm), we ordered the tacos to be told they no longer make them. WHAT?! We were just there the week before and had ordered them as we always do.\n\nAfter asking for an explanation the server continued to just tell us they don't, won't and CANNOT make them. We were in shock and insisted on an explanation -- he proceeded to not have one and just tell us to order something else. He suggested some \"crispy\" taco combination instead. Spare yourself -- the meat inside the tacos was cold and had no flavor. Barf.\n\nTo top it all off, the service is just terrible. The waiter was rude, he never brought us water (after reminding him twice) and the hostess doesn't even acknowledge/greet people who walk in. After a couple minutes of standing awkwardly in the doorway someone hurried us to a table in the back by the kitchen with plenty available seating up near the window. \n\nNeedless to say, my friends and I (who live in the Marina and often frequented this spot) won't be coming back.", "author": "Ali S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "The ever-expanding chain empire of Tacolicious made me a bit uninterested in trying them but a couple things conspired to get me in the door.  First was a story told at Porchlight by a T-licious chef about his Mexico City adventure to taste, then replicate, Contramar Restaurant's tuna tostada.  Tacolicious' version hit #29 on 7X7's 2012 Big Eat List of the \"100 things you must try before you die\" so I guess the Mexico City jaunt was worth it.  Second was the fact that the restaurant looked like a shadow of its usual self on a Monday at lunchtime and that's a good thing.  No hordes spilling out the doors, not sorority sisters jamming up the tables, just a single table in the outdoor sunshine with no wait.  I'm game.  \n\nComplimentary chips and mild salsa were the first things to arrive at our table.  They were delicious.  The bowlful was deceiving, appearing smaller than the usual Mexican restaurant's chip bowl, but it actually contained a perfect amount (aka a little too much) for two people.  Our waitress offered us more but we were well-satisfied.  Overdoing things at Monday lunch sets an ominous tone for the week ahead.   \n\nWe led off with the aforementioned \"albacore tuna tostadas contramar style\" with crispy leeks, chipotle mayo, and avocado ($10.95).  It was easy to understand how such a simple thing inspired a flight to Mexico City.  Two crisped corn tortillas were topped by the fine, fresh (raw fish) ingredients and served in a way that was easily split by two.  I've had a cheaper, similar version of ceviche served this way at a taqueria.  I'd be hard pressed to say you must try this dish before dying but it was quite good and worth the extra cost.\n\nWe followed tostadas with 4 tacos ($14) settling with consideration upon 2 with fried local rock cod, 1 traditional carnitas, and 1 chicken en mole colorado.  Each taco came with the traditional 2 corn tortillas (1 which I usually use for spillage).  Though amply filled, no spillage transpired, even when topped with a trio of unique salsas (red, green, and fire yellow).  \n\nThe rock cod taco was good but I have no shame in reporting that I like Rubio's version better.  The chicken en mole colorado though?  That was delicious, mainly because it's something for which I had no comparison.  A little savory, a little sweet, and a good-sized amount of filling.  \n\nI didn't taste the carnitas but noticed that the plate was emptied.  \n\nT-Licious is pricey for Mexican food and though I won't say I was wowed, I was definitely interested and liked what I ate.  More than what I ate though, I liked the menu with all the unusual little starter snack items.  If  I again found this place easy to get into I'd  consider a return visit to further sample from that section of the menu.  \n\nI'm pretty sure review #894 won't be the one that inspires you to give this Tacolicious a try and that's okay.  It increases my odds of my finding a seat on visit #2.", "author": "Tracey A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-27", "description": "I'm a huge fan of tacos of any variety--from authentic to inauthentic and Americanized to T-Bell, so I didn't think much about coming to Tacolicious . . . until I arrived. Two things, first: 1. The crowd here is so, so Marina, it almost feels like a caricature of the Marina because there's THAT much Marina going on here. Anyway, this isn't T-Lish's fault. 2. They use prayer candles all over this joint for aesthetic purposes. This, on the other hand, can be helped. Even my Mexican but incredibly hard-to-offend boyfriend found them kind of off-putting. \n\nThat aside, the food itself was just not great. Not bad, but . . . just generally missing the mark. The prices are steep (which is no surprise, but then again they never touted themselves as a taqueria so no blame either), and the tacos are stuffed to the brim with meat. So much meat--TOO much meat, dare I say?--that it threw off the ratio and lent itself to a rather drippy and one-note eating experience where, even if they were properly seasoned and cooked meats, I got bored after half a bite.\n\nThe tuna tostadas were a great starter though, tasty and texturally on-point with the smooth raw tuna, creamy avocado and sauce, and crunchy tostada bottoms. However they were also two small tostadas for $15 so I likely would have been more pleased with 30 Jack in the Box tacos.", "author": "Betty W."}

Waiter and accompanying staff were extremely attentive and friendly. They hooked it up with chips and salsa as soon as we sat down. Salsa was amazing. Ordered some guac and queso which was also delicious and came out quickly after we ordered it. \n\nLet's rewind for a minute though. The experience might have been completely perfect if the hostess didn't try to sit our 5 person party at what was clearly a 4 person table. We elected to sit outside to forgo a wait which was accommodating to some extent but outdoor seating in San Francisco is never my favorite (always too cold). Anyway, we were starving so we f'd the lemons and sacked up gaucho style. BUT when the hostess sat all 5 of us at what was clearly a 4 person table, a horrible chill rain through my  vascular fore arms. I was in shock, my friend se\u00f1or Qui\u00f1ones was so awkwardly positioned and jammed in at the corner of the table I looked up with an inquisitive glare and made eye contact with this so called hostess and LUCKILY for Tacolicious she realized how bad she had just performed the only function of her job and offered us an accompanying third table which made room for 6. \n\nNow that issue was resolved we ordered a pitcher of the house margarita which was great and got some great picante shots that are bundled in some great deal options. 4 for $12, 8 for $24 - might not be exact but was a pretty reasonable deal overall and their are some interesting options for shots. We ordered tacos that are offered in the same package deal situation for family style eating. \n\nLet's cut to the chase. Tacos were delicious. Short rib was the best one, Carnitas was great too. Drinks were on point. Service was a freaking 10 besides the initial seating incident. Place is the answer for tapas / tex-mex cuisine in The Marina area of San Fran.

We ended up getting up a pitcher of sangria while waiting ($26 and pretty good!).  The staff was nice about letting us hang out outside with our pitcher and the hostess tried to keep an eye on open bar seats as well for us.  We did encounter some rude staff though, commenting on how there were people in their way.  I get that it's hard to be a waiter in a busy restaurant with people standing around but we didn't create the tightly packed layout so don't make rude comments to your customers!\n\nWe were finally seated and it is a very compact restaurant.  Also, incredibly, incredibly loud.  I would have given Tacolicious 4 stars except for the noise, mostly due to the loud music rather than the busy guests.  For a dinner around 7, I don't want to have to shout to my friend!  My ears were still buzzing after leaving the restaurant!\n\nBut anyways, on to the food.  The chips and salsa to start - really good salsa!  We decided to share the enchiladas and four different types of tacos.  (Sidenote- why do they have one taco for $3.95 and four tacos for $14?  Where's the three taco deal?  Isn't that normal?  Four tacos is a lot!).  All in all, a lot of food!  The enchiladas were really good - a real smokey taste to the meat.  It was three enchiladas and only $8.  For the tacos, we had the vegetable one (squash and some other things), both chickens (a beer and a shot and a mole) and the chorizo.  The mole chicken was BY FAR the best.  The beer and a shot chicken was probably the least interesting, but if I want back I would probably just get all chicken mole tacos.\n\nSo, the food is pretty good.  But be prepared for a wait and a VERY LOUD restaurant.  In retrospect, we probably would have ordered food to go!", "author": "Rachael M."}

Definitely was surprised by how busy it was for a Thursday night. Tacolicious sounds like a cheap Mexican joint but it was the opposite.\n\nWe sat down and started with some drinks. Their house margarita was strong. They brought over (seemingly) made-in-house chips and salsa. The chips were a little oily for me but the salsa was good.\n\nNext we had the albondigas (meatballs) and those were tasty. The sauce was spicy which gave us a good kick and needed a little bit of water to mellow out the spice. The meatballs themselves were made with some good spices, large, and evenly cooked. A nice (and unique) appetizer to start with.\n\nOur main course were tacos, of course. We had the in house chicken, carnitas, and pacific cod. They also served it with three sauces: the salsa from before, a guacamole, and a sweet yellow sauce I couldn't put my finger on. All three were good. The carnitas definitely won the night with the fish a close second.\n\nWe would've closed with dessert but we were full. The bill came out to be what you'd expect from a place in the Marina for two people each ordering a drink. We're definitely going to go back to try more of their menu and especially the desserts that looked tempting.\n\nThe only cons are the dim lighting, noise (bar-like), and the cooks weren't fully up to food safety standards (i.e. drinking water next to the grills).", "author": "Chris L."}

It's PERFECT alongside a pitcher of the margarita picante. The margaritas here are absolutely delicious in a deceitfully strong way - just how I like it!\n\nThe ambiance is pretty Marina-casual - take that however you will. It's not very spacious and they don't take reservations so I'd recommend coming here earlier in the night to claim a prime spot. \n\nDefinitely consider Tacolicious on your next trip to the Marina for a fun post-work endeavor!", "author": "Priya S."}

I love the spice from the chipotle mayo.  Chips and salsa are complimentary but skip the guacamole (very good but kind of a rip off at $7.50).\n\nThey even had a kids menu - for $8 you can get the agua fresca del dia, your choice of taco or cheese quesadilla with rice & beans, and ice cream with chocolate sauce.\n\nOur server was super friendly.

For appetizers, I would recommend the albondigas guisadas. The dish has this savory taste to it, and the sauce has this marinara consistency to it. The tacos are amazing.

We decided to choose 5 different types of tacos and went with the following:\n\nNopales and Oaxaca cheese: This was really good to me with the cheese crispy and layered as a pancake on the tortilla. The nopales weren't bitter or tough but soft and delicious. \n\nBaja-Style Pacific Cod: This was a fat roll of fish that was fried and added to cabbage and cumin crema. \n\nTraditional Carnitas: This one was my favorite since well, PORK!! It had the right amount of flavor and juice that I wanted to have more. \n\nChicken in Mole: This one was my least favorite but I think it was the because of the sauce. There seemed to be too much of it and was just a tad too sweet. \n\nHouse-made Chorizo and Potatoes - I really only have one word for this taco...Yuuuuuuuuum!\n\nAs a side we also got the semi-traditional refried beans that have the cotija cheese which was $6 and also the rice-o-licious with mojo verde that was $5. \n\nI felt like having something a little different to drink so I tried their Moss drink, which is passion fruit, pineapple, and sparkling lemonade.

Even though they have a heater, it's still pretty cold so dress warm just in case.\n\nWe ordered 12 tacos (4 carnitas, 4 chicken mole, and 4 chorizo and potatoes). The best was by far the carnitas. I highly recommend them. The meat is tender and there's so much flavor! Yummmyyyy. I was too full to try the chorizo one but my coworker loves it. I'm sure all the tacos are delicious! We also ordered the brentwood corn; sweet but kinda sour from the sauce/marinade. The traditional churro dessert was delicious; nice and crunchy, but I think the chocolate sauce was unnecessary. We also ordered the laiola chocolate dessert thing too. It's basically chocolate ganache on baquettes.

Uggghh these tacos make my heart go a pitter patter! They're seriously so tasty; very simple and authentic. You can pick from a boatload of meats, and they also have vegetarian/vegan options. If you don't like spicy, try the carnitas. They're sweet with hardly any spice (they're my fave). Also, you might have the undeniable urge to order like 4 tacos on a breezy Sunday afternoon because, hey, yolo right? It's brunch and I'm gonna live large dammit! And also, THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD. But I'm telling you, these are FILLING. I'm full after one, and my record is like 1 and a half. Go easy, k my friend? OH MY GOSH THE GUACAMOLE. FORGET ABOUT IT. I have DREAMS about it. I seriously can't stop telling everyone about it.  Like.. It might be becoming a problem. My friends are a little worried. But I mean, when you're talking CALIFORNIA avocados, NATURALLY they're gonna make for a KICKASS GUAC. REGARDLESS, it was also my boyfriends favorite restaurant when he visited SF for the first time, and I took him EVERYWHERE. I'm happy to report that he now understands me on a deeper and more meaningful level, and it made our relationship that much stronger, so THANKS TACOLICIOUS. YES, there most likely will be a wait. Is it worth it? Does a bear s&@! in the woods? JUST DO IT. Never have I ever waited 45 minutes for a marg and a heaping pile of tacos and been like, \"UGH, yknow what I wish I DIDNT do? THIS.\" Im always like, \"THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.\" \nIn summation, anything you get here will be delish, worth the wait, don't go too bananas, try a margarita, and let your inner taco goddess free.", "author": "Olivia N."}

We were sat (at a table really for 2) right away. It then took over 10 minutes of us sitting there and asking the busser to find our server so that we could order. When the blonde, wavy haired, waitress finally did show up, she never apologized for being MIA, she simply asked us if we were ready. Knowing we wouldn't see much of her, we ordered everything at once. Our drinks again took another 7-10 minutes and the food about 25 (10 tacos). We didn't see our server for (no exaggeration) about 30 minutes. She never checked to see if we were doing okay, she never explained the fact that one of their sauces are insanely hot - so when we were desperate for water, my bf had to get up to find someone to refill it for us - again taking at least 4 minutes to even refill the container. \n\nThen at the end when we were beyond annoyed, we received the bill. For the amount of food we had, it was ridiculous. We had 2 beers, one glass of wine and ten tacos for $71. She of course didn't mention that when we ordered flour shells that they were an extra $1.25 each.\n\nShe never once thanked us, asked if we needed anything else or how everything was. Two out of the three of us have worked in the service industry for over 8 years. I will NEVER tip under 20% unless it was God-awful. We gave her a 10% tip that night and it was hard even giving her that.\n\nI will never go to that location again. SF has too many delicious restaurants with great service to waste your time at a place that barely acknowledges you.", "author": "Christine J."}

Not phoniness. Having that said....\n\n1) For some reason this location DOESN'T have a phone. What. The, F---. It's already a big hassle to place to-go orders at the damn bar at least have a phone like the other locations to place to-go orders. Not everyone wants to go online dammit. Tacolicious is technically a restaurant, not just a bar so I don't understand why you have to place to-go orders at the effing bar when there are SERVERS WITH A POS TERMINAL OUT FRONT WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE ORDERS FOR YOU. LIKE THEY DO OVER AT DELAROSA. Again, WHAT. THE. F---.\n\n2) I also repeat placing said orders in person are a hassle as you practically have to yell over the music and standard bar chatter/noise across the bar (which is like 3 or more feet wide) to the douchebag bartenders. I offered to write the order down on a piece of paper but the bear looking guy with a bad flannel shirt rudely told me to just tell him what the order was. So I kept trying to talk over the music. \n\n3) I remembered that I wanted to separate a couple of the tacos from the others, so when I finally got the taller douchebag's attention as he was handing me the bag, I ask can they separate a couple. He stills tries to hand me the bag saying they are all placed together. I say a little heatedly \"I know that but can they just separate 2 of the tacos???\" He gets a major attitude as handing it back to the cooks, which is funny because he acts like he's the one who had to separate them. \n\nThe first bartender I originally spoke with hears about what's going on and rudely tells me to next time say in advance I want separated, because they pack them \"family style\". This is where I start to get mad. FIRST OF ALL, they are TACOS. NOT SOUFFLE. YOU CANNOT MOTHER-EFFING TELL ME THAT IT'S SO MUCH TROUBLE TO OPEN THE CONTAINER, PICK UP TWO MOTHER EFFING TACOS OUT THE G---DAMN CONTAINER, AND WRAP THEM SEPARATELY. AND IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY IN THERE AT ALL WHEN I WENT THIS PAST WEEKEND!!! IT WAS NEAR THE END OF THE NIGHT, THE BAR WAS EMPTY AND THERE WERE A FEW TABLES WITH CUSTOMERS BUT THE BARTENDERS AND COOKS MOSTLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO. And yes I literally asked him to his face \"is it THAT hard to separate tacos??\" That's when he finally caught his attitude and tone of his voice when he realized he met his match. He tried to re-explain the family style thing which still didn't make sense. It's not SUSHI, it's not SCRAMBLED EGGS, they are TACOS. They are already separated by the shells. I'm not understanding why it's an entire new job just to fulfill a customer's request. This is the second location I've dealt with rude staff. I don't understand why they hire douchebags who think they are above everything just because it's San Francisco, but they will keep getting checked real quick if the snobby attitude keeps up. If you don't like your jobs, leave., \n\n4) There was another review on here that talked honestly about the actual quality of the tacos, and they are right. They are nothing special. However, it's good food for after-the-bars on an early night.", "author": "Marquis A."}

But after working an event for a solid 7 hours and not eating anything for even longer, I was OK with that. Got seated in a dark corner, had to use the light on my phone to read the menu, then ordered cheese dip, a spicy shrimp app, and two tacos (carnitas & braised short rib). The cheese dip tasted like it was from a can at the grocery store--again, I was really hungry so this didn't bother me one bit; the shrimps were awesome and had a building heat factor to them; and the braised short rib taco was MUCH better than the carnitas, which happened to be a bit dry.", "author": "Jon S."}

They were all delicious but the pasion was the best. My friends ordered their margs on the rocks but regretted not getting a trio to taste more. I then got a carnitas and chorizo taco.

Overall, the food was fresh, made to order and tasty but it wasn't special. \n\nI'm giving this place 3 stars because it was expensive! With tax and tip we paid $55 for 1 appetizer and 8 mini tacos. They charge the same amount for vegetarian tacos as they do for steak tacos.

We needed a good solid base before a day full of drinking. Tacolicious was a great choice to serve this purpose. Not only was the food incredibly good, the staff was friendly, and the cocktails are a fun combinations of flavors.\n\nWe ordered the following: \nTo start- Plantains, made to order Guacamole, and the kale salad.\n\nThe plantains were fried and served with ranch gordo heirloom beans and cumin crema. These were pretty incredible. The cumin crema offered a little bit of a savory flavor to the sweet plantains. I didn't realize they came with beans when we ordered them, but they were also a nice compliment to the overall dish. \n\nThe made to order guac is some of the best I have had in a while. It was fresh and flavorful. It had a nice hit of lime when you took a bite.\n\nThe Kale salad was tossed with cabbage, quinoa, persimmon, apples, carrots, roasted almonds, and a cider-cumin vinaigrette. I am normally not a fan of raw kale, but this salad was light and tasty. \n\nFor our main course we split 8 tacos. We tried the butternut squash, the beer and a shot chicken, the carnitas, the fried cod, the chicken in mole, the chiroizo con papas, and the filet mignon. The standouts for me were the chicken in mole, and the fried cod. The others that I actually tried (the butternut squash and the beer and a shot chicken) were good, but the chicken in mole and fried cod are where its at. \n\nFor our after entree drinks we decided to try some of the chupitos. We were confused by this concept at first. Basically what they are is one drink that is split into 4 shot glasses for 12 bucks. We tried two different ones, the margarita picante and the pasion. \n\nThe pasion is a drink made with habanero tequila, passion fruit and lime. the margarita picante is made with tequila, lime, and red chili-pepper. We were anticipating the pasion to be the spicier of the two drinks, but that was not the case. The margarita picante had quite the kick! I don't think I would be able to handle a full one of those.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-29", "description": "Another super long over due review is needed for this one, I should take stay cation days more often! Let me start with the only reason for the missing star is that it is always disgustingly busy. Now some may say this shouldn't detract from their rating, but I think part of the wait comes from waiter disorganization as often times after waiting 45 min for a table you will still have wait time when you sit down so be prepared with what you'd like to eat when the server gets to you and settle in.\n\nThat being said the food and drinks here are a winning combo. Their infused tequilla shooters and spicy magaritas are yummy just on their own. While they have other menu items than their tacos their tacos really do take the cake. You get to pick sets of tacos so if you go in a group it is a good idea to pick different kinds and share as you can't split up your groups. This same thing happens for their shooters (the man and I have actually traded shooters with a random couple next to us that also wanted to try different types so try that if you're stuck!)\n\nOut of all of their taco types the only kind I have ever been dissapoionted with is the rock cod. It may be because it was breaded and it felt like a fishstick on a taco to me. Hands down though my fav is their carnitas. I could eat four of those to myself if I really tried and be in a happy food coma they are that good. \n\nTheir queso and their guac are quite large too so if you are ordering those as starters be aware that youll get full fairly quickly and a large number of tacos may be hard to take down.\n\nAnother note is the bathroom is a bit dirty at all times. It is to be expected though as there is only one and it  is situated right near the kitchen which isnt very encouraging of cleaning mid lunch or dinner service. Add to that the typical alcohol intake of the marina inhabitants it can get a bit rank. So if you  are squeamish about that pop into one of the bars nearby on the way out.", "author": "Meg N."}

In SF it seems like a newer explosion of everything mexican with some awesome results. Tacolicious, goofy name and all seems to make it work.\n\nCool vibe of this place with a small yet potent menu.  Some great apps.  The guacamole, bean dip and cheese dip were all tops.  The cheese dip in particular is something so old fashioned and bad for you, but done so well, it just begs to be eaten and eaten and eaten.  It made me remember that in my high school days I used to devour this stuff at my friends house on Sundays when we watched football. And this version was even better.  Any food that does the long time memory jog must be a good thing!\n\nGreat comp chips were crispy cooked and super fresh.  Salsas ( three of them) were also great and a bit different.\n\nAlbacore tostada was a starter and quite yummy.  Marinated tuna had chipoltle mayo that had just the right kick with some crispy leeks. Nice touch.\n\nTacos were all quite good with the exception of the carnitas which is to bad.  To me Carnitas are the go to in an authentic mex place and in L.A. there are some that are awesome.  These were sweet with no char or pungency to make them memorable.  So for me, I'd skip them next time.  The short ribs and chicken mole tacos were really really good.\n\nMany other menu items sounded fantastic so will hope to return to sample more.  Thats always a good sign.  \n\nThey say all the food is sustainable and humane and farmer friendly.  (Like the farmers are petting their livestock so we know they are happy.).   I like friendly farmers so I'm in.\n\nHad some nice booze drinks and a virgin one called Moss that hit the spot.\n\nService was great and the young woman who I think was the manager did two nice check ins to make sure we were all happy.  The place was hopping which it seems is the norm. \n\nSo looks like LA may have some good competition for trendy yet reasonably priced hip mexican.  SF puts another foodie gotta go place on the map.

Second time was actually better than the first. \n\nThink modern decor and low prices. It's a win-win. It is always crowded with young and good looking people if you're into that. \n\nThe two tacos which I really like so far are the cod tacos and the carnitas. Slight edge to the carnitas. The short rib tacos are supposed to be really good (according to my friend - I didn't actually try them). \n\nHonestly, the service wasn't that great the first time as my server dissappeared as he flirted with a table full of blondes but the second time around was much better.\n\nThe chips and guac are also very good. \n\nPresentation is also very nice.

The wait is long-but that's due to popularity-however, there is no excuse for the hostesses' lack of attention. They are slow to fill tables and appeared checked-out on 2 of the three occasions I came here. The wait-staff is understaffed. They do a decent enough job, but they need help. No one came to check on our meal progress or refilled the water which had run out. Further, our busser got the next table's drink order wrong and didn't bother asking if I wanted another beer. The tables are stacked tightly. So close that patrons have to move the whole table out to climb into their seat. Last but not least, some genius employee placed a doggy water cup behind my seat without telling me.

Once we sat down, and overindulged in two baskets of chips, we put in our order:\n\n-3 carnitas tacos\n-2 chicken tacos\n-3 short rib tacos\n\nWe also ordered a pitcher of the El Camino, and it proved to be more like a regular margarita.  Not necessarily bad, but we were expecting something a little different.  Anyway, the carnitas taco was probably the best out of the three, but in all I thought all of them were pretty good.  A little pricey, obviously, but still good.  The one issue here is that the bar area overflows into the eating areas, so you end up having to yell over the plaid shirt-wearing, overdressed and high heeled wearing crowd that turns up around 8pm.

I explained this to him and he took it away. I looked around for our server but she was nowhere to be found. A few minutes later, we decided to just pay for what we'd received and leave. I stopped our server at the POS station and explained that we were leaving and wanted our check. She was confused because she was sure our order had just gone out.

Because there was so much different Mexican fusion eats to pick from, our waiter recommended the Albacore Tuna Tostada and the taco 4-pack. \n\nAlbacore Tuna Tostada - [http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ATcV86xCrL4W_Ug-PBV1qw/l.jpg]\nDon't get me wrong, the tuna tostadas were very good but for $11.00 and considering you only get 2 small tuna tostadas, it's definitely leaves you with a \"wtf? that's it\" look.. \n\nGuajillo Braised Short Rib (x2), \nTraditional Carnita (x2), \nAncho Chile Braised Short Rib Taco (x1) - \n[http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QB-i6_4HDalk9uNdIpSktg/l.jpg]\nSo on our 4-pack of tacos, we got 2 of the carnitas and 2 of the braised short ribs, so that my girlfriend and I could each have one. The ancho chile taco was T-lish's \"Taco of the Week\" special, so we got 1 to try it out (which was about $4.00). \nThe guajillo short rib taco was packed with meat (nice!) but on the other hand, was very very oily (blah).. I kept my taco in midair in attempts to drip most of the excess oil out. But on the other hand, the carnita taco hit the spot. Nicely roasted pork, and a lot of it, on two warm taco shells. Lastly, the ancho chile taco was good, but a tad too salty and oily (it is adobo after all), but just not as oily as the guajillo one. \n\nTacolicious does make delicious tacos, it's in their name after all, and the staff was very nice, but our little 7 taco fiesta, along with 1 Sierra Nevada draft, summed up slighty over $35.00.. It was good, but incredibly overpriced. Do you know how many tacos you can get from a Taco Truck with thirty-five bucks? Exactly.", "author": "Albert L."}

The sauces that came with them were not very tasty at all and the whole time we kinda wished we had spent our money somewhere else.

The loud music coupled with the beautiful young women with straight hair and chunky jewelry immediately took me to 1999 when half my pay check went to rent and the other half went towards clothes and going out. Tacolicious in the Marina whisked me back to my 20's when all the bars and restaurants in the city were jammed pack and you could hail a limo to drive you to the next neighborhood.  We were staying.\n\nAs soon as my Margarita de la casa arrived our table along the window wall was ready. We squeezed passed a couple on their first date, I later realized, and continued to check out the scene of  good looking, well dressed Marina people. Cate started to shimmy so I knew the music was no longer a problem.  Although they do have a kids menu, I always have Cate share with me so that she can experience new flavors.  We had a hard time choosing our 4 four tacos because they all looked delicious. The menu has something for everyone. From kale salad to Mexican style meatballs , your little one could even just dig into a side of drunken beans and rice-o-licious with mojo verde. We ended up choosing the roasted butternut squash with pasilla peppers, fried pacific rock cod cabbage, tangy crema, traditional carnitas, and the chicken en mole colorado.

Gourmet tacos in an energetic setting on the busy and trendy Chestnut Street near the Marina District. The food is different and very tasty, but the noise - it's very loud in there - and the service - they seemed overwhelmed and struggled to keep up - were drawbacks.\n\nMy favorite taco by far was the Short Rib. Meaty, juicy and tender with a perfect burn of spice. Wow! The Filet Mignon tacos were also quite delicious, but they are $2 extra per taco, so beware of sticker shock when you get the bill. (Kudos to the server for telling us this fact up front.) The other tacos are good, but I would order a plate of the short rib tacos the next time...wonderful.\n\nThe food is messy, the parking is difficult, the patrons are packed in there like sardines in a can and, strangely, the bathroom is in the kitchen area. However, that's what you get in San Francisco sometimes.\n\nI'd sum up Tacolicious as a 5-star taco joint - how absurd it sounds to write that - with enough deductions to drop it down to 4 stars...maybe 3-1/2 stars.

Despite the cutesy name, the Marina Girl salad ($9.95) with romaine, avocado, cucumber, radishes, pumpkin seeds, cotija cheese, and a light, but spicy, vinaigrette is a winner. Deep and rich, a favorite is the Camarones (shrimp) a la diabla ($10.95).  Perfectly seasoned--not too fiery, not too bland--it rocks.

Here's what I thought of what we ordered:\n\nEmpanadas: they're trying for a veg-frienly version with purple potatoes & peas and sweet corn puree.  It was tasty but a bit dry inside, which is probably why it is served with the puree and pico de gallo.  It wasn't my favorite interpretation of the dish.\n\nAlbacore tuna tostadas: this was actually the best thing I ate.  The fish was fresh (or at least they put enough lime juice on it so I couldn't tell otherwise).  The whole plate worked and was very good.  Sure, the crunchy tostadita round ensured that you were sandwiching broken pieces together as you finished it, but what the heck.\n\nCarnitas tacos: The pork was too dry...there's really no way around it.  Put all the salsa you want on it but it can't mask the fact that you have excessively dry carnitas.  Ugh, with the massive latin american culinary talent in SF it amazes me that restaurants can still goof something as fundamental as carnitas.\n\nFilet tacos: Good, but nothing stupendous.  My friend claimed it was the best thing he ate there.  I thought it was good but nothing to write home about.  It was \"your standard taco\".\n\nOne bonus is that the hot salsa that they serve with the chips is particularly good...surprisingly so.\n\nThe service was generally good and friendly.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the prices were about what I had expected.\n\nBut in the end, it's a \"Mexican\" place with an emphasis on booze in the Marina.

Ok, and that's not even it.\n\nBy this time, our original waitress was already off her shift, so we asked for the manager. The manager told us that she didn't know about the bug situation. We told her everything and she exclaimed that it had been \"fair\" since the waitress brought out \"clean\" drinks after we pointed out the bugs. She pretty much insisted on us paying the full bill. \n\nI disagreed with her vehemently by saying that the drinks shouldn't have bugs in them in the first place and that the waitress should have checked before bringing them over. I asked her \"What if we hadn't noticed the bugs and drank it?\" or \"If she would served drinks like that to customers?\" or \"if any other respectable establishment would just brush off this problem?\" She admitted she never checked in with the waitress OR the bartender. This was Sunday night at 10PM, mind you. It was NOT busy and she had been chit-chatting with said waitress and bartender this WHOLE time. \n\nEven then, she wasn't apologetic about it. She kept insisting that they already did what they can do about the situation and was SUPER PATRONIZING in her responses. With her tone of voice, I wouldn't be surprised if she assumed that the three of us, Asian guys, were just being Asian trying to get out of paying $20 from the bar tab. If it came down to poor customer service in the restaurant industry, this manager would easily win an award for being the perfect case study.\n\nEventually, in her condescending tone, she offered to \"comp\" us the drinks \"if that's what we really wanted.\" Um...no, bitch. I can afford my drinks. And since you put it that way, I'll even pay for it to make a statement about the crappy service we received and that it's not about the money. So take this $20 and shove it.\n\nTo make matters worst, this was a birthday dinner for the friend who had the two bugs in his drink. I couldn't have been more appalled for even suggesting Tacolicious.\n\nI've frequented Tacolicious a few times before, and this will for sure be my last time. After this, I wouldn't recommend ANYONE to come here, with the exception of the health department. Final note, good luck if you're ordering sangria or any dark drinks because you won't even notice the bugs that could be in your drink. And even if there are bugs, Tacolicious will make DAMN sure that it's YOUR problem and that YOU pay for them.", "author": "Jeremy F."}

Well a friend and I found ourselves hungry and headed for the water so Tacolicious provided the perfect pit stop, and wow am I glad I finally went.  \n\nThe soup was some of the most flavorful tortilla soup I've had, and the carnitas taco was kind of mind-blowing.  I kept telling people it was so amazing because of the grease, which in retrospect probably was not the ideal way to market it.  But it's like a tasty, healthy, not disgusting grease? (ok, obviously not healthy, and not over abundant, but trust me, it's a good grease).  That was one of the best carnitas tacos I've ever had.  I hope it wasn't just because I was starving, but I'm totally coming back.  My lunchmate seemed just as satisfied with her two tacos, and we both devoursed the chips and salsa.

We were pretty lucky to be seated fairly quickly, on the outside of the restaurant, literally. There's no patio, no fence, just casual street-style.\n\nWe ordered their fresh guacamole ($7.65) and the chili con queso ($7.50) to go with their crispy tortilla chips. The guac is wholesomely creamy and delicate, a palate pleaser, but the queso dip is even better; it arrived at the table attractively steamy, it's very rich but the spice cuts out the fattiness, and makes takes the dish to a whole new level.\n\nOf course, the star of the show are their large selection of tacos (10 for $33, 4 for $14):\nI know everyone would struggle to pick out their favorites, but here are a few that I'd order again:\nChicken En Mole, that shredded chicken remains heavenly moist in that slightly smoky sweet chocolaty goodness.\nGuajillo Braised Beef Short Rib, there's nothing special about it, except that huge hunky piece of tender meat loading up the entire tortilla, gets better with a touch of their medium salsa.\nButternut Squash, I ordered this out of curiosity and I am delighted to report that this taco stands up to all the other selections; the various grilled veggies are so underrated.\n\nOverall, this place is a bit pricey, but anyone expect a bit of a premium for great place for a chill Mexican-party.

Had two chorizos, two short-ribs, two taco-of-the-week: buffalo chicken, one carnitas, one chicken en mole, one cod, and one shot & beer braised chicken. I had a chorizo, short rib, buffalo chicken, and carnitas but it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped. I liked the buffalo chicken best if I had to choose. The tacos came with three sauces ranging from spiciest (yellow/orange) to not (green). I liked the green one best. \n\nCheck and service to help us take tacos home for our mom was quick. An experience but won't be back unless my sister wants it again.", "author": "Amanda C."}

This was our first time but have always heard good things about the place. \n\nIt was packed but we were seated in 5 minutes. So glad the brunch menu included all their regular items (usually places have smaller brunch menu). Since it's brunch I had to get the sparkling sangria and my partner ordered the margarita fresca. My sangria was good but boy that margarita fresca with cranberries was soo soo yum!! I did order it as my second brunch cocktail LOL\n\nThe ladies next to us had the tuna tostadas and convinced us to order it because she thought it's the best thing ever. So we did and really liked it! Very good. I had the 4 tacos deal for $14.. 1 chorizo con papas (good), 1 fried rock cod (ok and my least favorite), special of the day chicken (not sure what it was but it was good), and the chicken mole (my favorite .. soo good!). I like that they put the tacos on 2 corn tortillas. They are smaller size but by no means will you go hungry (esp if you order 4). My partner ordered from the brunch menu bistec huevos rancheros I think.. he liked it but said it was average. But we both really liked this place, and was surprised at how good it tasted and very good approximate of what Mexican food should taste like. The service was excellent also. I have heard disparaging remarks about the neighborhood of Marina.. but we always love it! We meet the nicest people and enjoy good food. We'll be back!", "author": "Vol T."}

I mean, if you're going to make up a new word to describe how good your tacos are, they can't be average or mediocre.  Taco-verage?  Taco-ocre?  Umm...no.  Nevermind the fact that they wouldn't even taste good, it doesn't even sound fun nor does it roll off the tongue as well.  \n\nEnded up coming out here with a few friends to check out just how tacolicious these tacos were.  The reigning king of the moment for me is Nick's tacos from Underdog, but I've read some favorable reviews for Tacolicious as well.  To get a bit of variety for us to try and compare, we each put in identical orders of four tacos ($12 for four): fried local rock cod, housemade chorizo and potato, shot-and-a-beer braised Petaluma chicken, and guajillo braised beef short rib.  And let me tell you, 16 tacos take up a lot more space than you would think.  But, when the waitress dropped two huge plates onto our table, It was on!\n\nFried Rock Cod - my favorite of the bunch.  Rock cod is one of my favorite types of fish, and they did this one right.  Fairly generous sized portion and garnish, nice crispy batter, and good flavor.  Not quite to the level of Nick's, but I would recommend it.\n\nBraised Petaluma Chicken - although I was okay trying it, it was the one that I was least excited about when our order went in (personally, I would haven chosen carnitas).  For me, it was pretty middle of the road since nothing about it stood out.  I didn't find the chicken that flavorful, but I wouldn't quite call it bland either (I've had worse chicken tacos).\n\nGuajillo Braised Beef Short Rib - though it wasn't my favorite, it wasn't too far behind the cod.  Of the group, I thought that it probably packed the most punch in terms of flavor, but the cod was better overall.  The meat was fairly moist as a whole, and I liked that you got the taste of that char too.  Most of the meat was pretty tender too.\n\nChorizo and potato - my least favorite of the bunch, and would not get it again.  Generally, I like chorizo since it usually has some strong, meaty spice and flavor, but I wouldn't have known it was in there if I hadn't read the menu.  For me, it tasted more like seasoned potatoes, and it had the matching soft consistency.  Disappointing.\n\nIn addition, the free chips and salsa they offer for each table is pretty good.  Beyond the food though, I thought the service was great as our waitress was helpful and friendly, but seating can be problematic.  Given the layout (bar takes up a lot of space), seating is limited and even when you're at the table, it can feel a little tight.  Grabbing a seat at the bar is not a bad alternative, but it can get pretty packed over there as well.  Given the popularity, there's usually a crowd at any given time, so I'd recommend going with a smaller group if possible and a little earlier or later to try to avoid the peak dinner hours.  Definitely worth trying though.", "author": "Mike L."}

Get over it. Not everyone drinks and I was heading up to Napa the next day. I didn't need any more alcohol. He begrudgingly took my enchiladas order and gave me some chips and salsa while I waited.

Also, I got to try one of the shrimp cakes which was really good too. \n\nOverall I thought the atmosphere was really noisy to enjoy a meal with friends. Also, said bartender told the guy next to me who ordered a martini that he could only make him one because it wasn't too busy yet and therefore he had the time.

In my 10 minute walk from my car to Tacolicious I had, no joke, two girls stare me up and down. It was probably because I was not wearing a single item of Lululemon attire, and therefore I stood out.  I rarely venture into this sub-world of San Francisco, and it's always an adventure when I do.\n\nThe minute I walked into Tacolicious, the blond hostess gave me a big, welcoming smile and told me she would be right with me. She took my Marina-edge off immediately and for probably the first time in my Marina-ventures, I felt truly welcomed into a restaurant.  I was 30 minutes early to a dinner date with two friends, but the hostess told me to grab a drink and let her know when my friends got here because she would make sure we were at the top of the list. I sat at the bar near the kitchen and did a little work while I waited.\n\nMy girlfriends arrived, and within 5 minutes of letting the hostess know we were ready, she came over to update us on the status of our table.  She had us seated soon after, all the while maintaining a very genuine and  friendly demeanor.\n\nWe shared the 10 taco plate and the shrimp a la diabla.  Tacos were fresh and yummy, but the shrimp a la diabla was the big hit. The salsas were flavorful and spicy without wreaking havoc on my taste-buds.  Our waitress was friendly and offered the perfect balance of good service with leaving us to our girl-chatter.  I drank beer, my pregnant friend had a delicious lemon, lime and mint drink, and my other friend had the tickle me telmo. Overall, I would say the food was very good.  This is not \"knock your socks off\" Mexican, but the food is great and the prices are right.\n\nI rarely write reviews, as you can tell from my Yelp history, but I wanted to recognize the hostess.

We went at 430 pm on the weekend and there was already a pretty big crowd.  We were able to get seats at the bar to eat.  The wait staff was great pretty attentive considering the amount of the people eating there.  \n\nI had the carnitas and fish tacos.  The fish tacos can either be fried or grilled and, of course, I opted for fried.  The fish taco was ok, definitely not as good as Nick's Tacos.   The carnitas on the other hand was pretty tasty.  The tacos are one for $3.95, 4 for $14 or 10 for $33.  They were mini sized tacos, so I thought the value was average.  \n\nThe guacamole was $8.95 and was pretty natural tasting, i.e. really just avocados and not much else.  Again, it was good, but I wasn't sure if it was worth the money.  My friends had the margaritas ($12) and again they said were ok.  We did get free chips and salsa, and actually that was pretty good.  The chips were thicker and lightly salted and the salsa had a nice kick to it.  \n\nIt did get pretty crowded as it got closer to 5pm and subsequently a bit pushier.  I had someone put there bag on my stool while I was till sitting on it and basically resting her bag on my back. (The stool was as close to the bar as it could get, the seat was just bigger than my bottom).  The lady didn't even apologize when I looked at her.  In addition someone finished their can of beer and put their arm between our conversation to put their trash on the bar.  I understand they are busy and crowded, but couldn't you at least put your trash in between groups rather than in the middle of people talking?\n\nOverall for food, I think there are better places to get value.  However, I think this place is pretty good for a night out drinking with your friends, hanging out with the yuppie crowd and meeting new people.", "author": "Mel L."}

I came here, party of 3, and the wait was almost 2 hours on a Saturday night at 7pm. \n\nIt was probably worth it though, as we were seated with some delicious chips and salsa, and we ordered guacamole and a pitcher of sangria right off the bat. Our waitress told us the pitchers are usually about 4 drinks large. We got 6 drinks outta this one (not sure if we just got lucky, or maybe they're larger than she thought).\n\nThe salsa and guac were both very fresh, and the chips were excellent too. My friends ordered a variety of tacos, and I ordered the beef taquitos. The tacos looked pretty delicious, however, I preferred my 4 taquitos smothered in guacamole and salsa. Every table gets a salsa dish with 3 salsa samplings when your meal comes. Mild, Medium, and Hot. All fantastic!\n\nI'll try out the tacos next time I'm here-- which will most likely be for lunch on a weekend with [hopefully] a lot less wait time.\n\nAn odd fact about the place: there's Jesus candles everywhere. Why? I don't know. Jesus is ubiquitous, especially in Tacolicious.\n\nA Tip: tried to plan a part of 15-20 guests here for a Saturday night. They told me they could possibly do that, but the table would not be guaranteed and to call the day of. If you're planning a large party here, have it be on a weeknight, or don't expect it to work out.", "author": "Ashley D."}

North) and were laughed out of Zushi Puzzle for daring to show up without a reservation. I remembered that Tacolicious had been on my bookmarks list, so we gave it a shot. It was a pretty quick wait for a Friday night--about 15-20 minutes. We were seated toward the front of the restaurant in a teeny tiny table with a banquet on one side and chair on the other. I kind of felt like I was eating in an airplane seat the whole time. \n\nWe ordered the squid veracruz, which was really good, as well as a bunch of tacos and some sides. The chips and salsa were good, although nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. We each had a veggie taco, the grilled rock cod, and the chicken mole. The veggie ended up being my favorite, followed by the chicken mole. The fish was actually bland and tasteless and ended up being my least favorite. The drunken beans, on the other hand, were overly salty--way too salty for my taste. The rice was OK. \n\nI also got a honey citrus drink, which I didn't like very much, but drank the whole thing. I think I'm just not a huge fan of that much citrus, but for someone who likes that it would probably be great. My own honey was excited to get a Mexican bottle of coke (yay for no high fructose corn syrup!). \n\nI'm anxious to try the Mission Tacolicious as I'm sure it will be a much different vibe. The Marina was super loud--so loud that we couldn't really talk to each other across the table because we couldn't hear each other surrounded by young 20-something L.A. North folks.

I try not to eat many chips in Mexican restaurants, but these are awesome! There is sea salt all over the chips, which brings out the flavor, but they are not too salty. The salsa is really flavorful as well, and very different from other places. \n\nOnce you order your tacos, they bring these three salsas, in a cool and modern tray and plates. Avocado mild, medium spiced tomato, and spicy tomatillo / jalapeno. These sauces are also great with the chips. \n\nAs for the tacos,  they  are made with soft shells, and fresh grilled / cooked ingredients. In my opinion, the braised beef is by far the best. Bold beef flavor, tender and delicious. Another great option is the Chicken in Mole sauce. Satisfies the sweet and salty cravings. \n\nAnd couldn't leave behind the ahi tuna appetizer.  Must try! \n\nOn a sunny day, just take one of the few tables outside, grab your margarita or draft beer, and enjoy all their food items.\n\nOne warning, though.

The chef from Tacolicious was providing the food, which was scrumptious. me and the wife along with our best friends tasted the tacos and beans and rice. Immediately we knew that we needed to go here. Finished getting RIPPED at the party. Headed down to Tacolicious, the place was busy, and the food smelled good. we were seated at the bar ordered about 20 tacos: carnitas, rock-cod, braised short rib. They were even better here.  Hands down, best in da city\nThe chips and salsa was On Point. And, yes they keep em coming. As we were eating the chef recognizes us from the party and was stoked that we came down. \nThe atmosphere and vibe was great, location is great. parking will be based on what time you come, hard to find or easy to find. \n\nWill definitely visit again and again.

I would and have been back, but only when I know it'll be less busy.\n\nAmbiance: Loud, colorful and robust.  Then again, that's WHY you come here.  You may have to speak extra loud to one another on Tuesdays... Get it?  Taco Tuesdays?  TIP: GO FOR A GOOD TIME.  2nd TIP:  GO EARLY.\n\nService:  The people here are friendly and will take your order in full anticipation of questions from you.  On Thursday night, they were particularly busy (in part because of Happy Hour), so I could tell that they were stressed.  They still took the time to answer our questions about which tacos to have without sense of irritation.\n\nFood:  VERY GOOD.  I digress that the majority of my favoritism for this place wasn't because of the ambiance or the service, but mainly the food.  If you want to order from this place, but don't want to deal with loud, cramped surroundings, try ordering ahead and taking it to go (if they let you, I don't know, I haven't tried).  There's something to be said, however, about their dipping sauces, which I'm not sure are available \"to-go.\"  I couldn't stop trying them.  Yummooo\n\nBe sure to try the Tuna Tostadas.  hell yes!

Let's put it this way, to get into that seat, you have to slide the table of the other customers over if you are larger than 100 lbs.  A hipster place with a couple of moms dragging along their toddlers for lunch.\n\nWe didn't think much of the melon/jicama salad, about $9. It was too spicy for hubby, sprinkled with chili powder.  The 4 tacos for $13 was flavorful especially the carnitas.  I didn't like my chicken mole and the short rib was \"ok\". It came with 3 types of sauce to top your soft tacos, including a bland tomatillo sauce. Hubby got a side of the rice, $5,  was really good.  It had this spicy green sauce on top, again.. too spicy hot for him. \n\nOur waitress was very nice and had these cute glasses on which made her look like Anne Hathaway to me.  They do give you a lge carafe of water and if you're not a fan of moderately hot/spicy food, you will need it.  We drank that whole carafe.  The complimentary chips with salsa was very good and you can ask for chip refills.\n\nI'd come back for the carnitas tacos and may consider trying some of the others but when you can get tacos for under $2 in the MIssion dist or even off the taco trucks, it might not be worth the struggle to hunt for metered parking spaces at $3/hr in the Marina.", "author": "Ry T."}

No reservations available so take your chances.  The hostess advised us that the wait for 2 was 1 hour - whether we get a table or obtain bar seating. (1/2 of the bar in front of the kitchen is reserved, the other 1/2 is open seating)\n\nWe opted to wait the hour even though we were both famished.  While we waited, I sipped on a Margarita Picante. LOVED IT!  The red chili pepper and vinegar flavors were obvious and delicious!  This margarita had a nice kick.  We noticed a few chairs were open at the bar and the hostess told us that 1 of the parties were being moved to a table.  She said we could have the bar seating, or continue waiting for a table.  We snagged the bar seats right away.  We had perfect view of the baseball game on TV and couldn't wait to eat.  The only downside of bar seating, at night, is that it gets a bit dark.  Only the other 1/2 of the bar, near the kitchen, was well lit and out of traffic from the customers standing around trying to order drinks.  \n\nWe ordered chili con queso (mike's cheese dip) and tacos (carnitas and braised beef short rib).  The cheese dip hit the spot.  I love cheese so I would've preferred a bigger bowl.  Between 2 people it's certainly enough but any more than 2 would be too little.  My favorite amongst the 2 tacos was the braised beef short rib.  Extremely juicy and flavorful.  My hubby, on the other hand, preferred the carnitas.  They were both delicious.\n\nI ordered a 2nd margarita during dinner known as the Margarita Fresca.  The description of pomegranate and citrus enticed me.  However, it tasted like a regular margarita.  It had some hint of orange flavor but it wasn't as satisfying as the Margarita Picante.\n\nTacolicious got busier throughout the evening and it felt very cramped where we were seated.  We really only came here for the tacos so there wasn't much need to stay once we were done eating.

I've found some of my previous restaurant outings to be sub-par, the folks that hob-nob around the community aren't exactly my peoples, and usually, you won't leave the neighborhood without dropping $60 or $70 on an outing that should probably cost you no more than $30. Obviously, this is an arguable figure... but it's just my experience.\n\nI don't think I'm alone in almost writing this place off as a tourist trap with a name like Tacolicious. I mean, would you even think about eating at a joint called \"Pizzaville\" or \"Sushi-Rama\" that happens to be situated in an area of town where many, many non-locals decide to push around their baby strollers and break in the awesome new Crocs they swooped at a Walgreens drug store? Probably not... and a taco shop in the Marina with a goofy moniker and an assembly line of fake tans and Prada glasses doesn't make it much more appealing either. But, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, right?\n\nIn a classic example of looking beyond the book cover before judging its contents, Tacolicious fully delivered. Got seats at the bar without hesitation (even though there was a wait to find a table), they had an amazing bowl of guacamole that they literally made from scratch per request (no freezers or day-old batches), and the margaritas were insane! I'd never go as far as to say they're better than Tommy's, but they just might be a close 2nd or 3rd, for sure! \n\nWhether you're looking for something sweet or spicy, they can provide a libation to suit your needs. Of the two I had a chance to knock down, the Pasi\u00f3n margarita was my favorite. Had just three ingredients - habanero-infused tequila, passion fruit and lime - but hot damn, was that sucker tasty! \n\nWhat I also really liked was their sense of humor on the menu. Clearly, they know they've got a good thing on their hands, but they don't take themselves too seriously. For instance, the umbrella of N/A beverages is described as \"drinks for drivers, kids, and recovering bartenders.\" To poke fun at some of the pretentiousness of this city's restaurant scene, to expound on their chili con queso dip, they explain, \"sustainable? no. local? nope. delicious? yep!\" How great is that?\n\nSo glad I was able to take my Marina blinders off for a moment to enjoy the greatness that is Tacolicious. By no means does it compete with the authentic grind you'll find at some of the Mission taquerias, but it's a fun spot for great upscale Mexican food and some amazing drinks... especially on one of the most amazingly beautiful days this city has seen in ages. \n\n\u00a1Arriba!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

The bf enjoyed the batter on the cod & gave the carnitas a thumbs up. Their salsas were spicy & complimented the over-stuffed filling in each taco nicely. I think our taste buds were very, very happy today.\n\nOur dessert was interesting...I couldn't decide if I liked it or loved it. Our squeaky clean, empty plate implied I probably loved the dark chocolate mousse sprinkled with sea salt, drizzled with olive oil & accompanied  by a side of crusty toasted baguette slices. Creative, simple and a little odd-it just works so well. \n\nService was impeccable. I will definitely be returning for my taco fix.\n\nTotal: $36 (not including tip.)\n\nP.S. To Miss Patty P.--me & my taste buds thank you for your detailed review of the restaurant that took Laiola's place! You made me want to try it & I am a happier, albeit heavier, person for it!", "author": "Fancypants X."}

While waiting for our food, one of the servers came out with chips and salsa. I've had better chips and salsa, but I still enjoyed stuffing my face with em haha...the chips weren't oily, and had just the right amount of sea salt on them...salsa was good, but I would have liked it to have a bit of a kick to it...\n\nSo...the server comes over with a couple of plates of tacos, and says,\"Alright so I got 10 tacos here.\" The guy sets it on our table, and my bf and I were like...uhh...we didn't order 10...the guy looks at the tacos and counts it, and says,\"Sorry, I mean 8...4 of the carnitas, 4 of the short rib.\" Lol...the tacos also came with 3 sides of different sauces...I feel so ashamed for not knowing the names of the three sauces, but what I can tell you is that they were green, yellow, and red-brownish (the green tasted a bit like guacomole, not sure about the yellow, and the red-brownish one tasted like the salsa)\n\nFood experience was great!! The flavor of the beef short rib was soooo good...omg...so flavorful, the meat was tender, not too juicy,greasy,or fatty. Bf's carnitas were also delicious...the meat could have used a little more pulling/shredding though...some of the meat were left in chunks that's why haha...\nthe tacos were soft and yummy...the tacos definately taste FRESH!\n\nDespite the price of the tacos, I definately enjoyed eating here...I'll be sure to come back here the next time around....", "author": "Zerrilyn P."}

It was good, but I don't know if I would come back again and shell out the $11 for those two dinky things. Don't get me wrong.

Ironic since I definitely had more than a Taco, a Tecate, and Tequila. Well played, Tacolicious, well played. \n\nI expected Tacolicious to be good. It was packed when my friend and I got there at 6 on a Saturday night and we waited for a good 45 minutes. We got seated at the bar, which I'm normally not a fan of, but it ended up being completely awesome as we could see everything that was going out. And the slam dunk competition was on. \n\nSitting at the bar was also dangerous. Everything looked so good! So in stead of going with the special, we opted for 4 tacos and the Albacore Tostadas. After eyeing the party next to us, we also decided to get the house made guacamole (best. decision. ever.). The tacos we ended up getting were the cochinita pibil, the braised shortrib, the fried fish, and the chicken. Each was really good and really fresh. I would recommend the braised shortrib. It was juicy and tender and had the perfect balance of seasoning. and it had some fatty goodness to it. Mmm. \n\nI was a little disappointed with the tostadas. EVERYBODY and I mean EVERYBODY in tacolicious was ordering these and conceptually, they looked and sounded amazing. But I found mine to be EXTREMELY salty. Had to lather it in guacamole to balance it out. \n\nThe salsas they provided were all really good. Really smoky with a roasted tomato quality to them. \n\nInstead of tequila/tecate, we ended up going with cocktails. I have no idea what we ordered, but JESUS CHRIST THEY WERE STRONG. They were like drinks you get a clubs; flavored just enough so that you can call them cocktails, and strong enough so just one will do the job. \n\nThe energy in this place is great. It's really upbeat, and the vibe is cool and modern. I really didn't mind how packed or noisy it was. It's a little pricey, but all in all not bad.", "author": "Michelle Q."}

It's a bit egregiously loud, I must say. But this was on a Friday night.\nIf you want a quiet, chill dining experience, do not expect it here (at least not Thursday through Sunday eves). If you don't want to be intimately entwined in your neighbors' conversations, do not venture here. If you like to eat leisurely and take your sweet time digesting, it 'aint gonna happen here.\n\nBut given the popularity of the place, and the tightness of the quarters - we were a table of 3, and I was cheek-to-cheek with a friend on the window bench, who was cheek-to cheek with the next patron, and so-on - the service was swift and thorough, and the drinks and food were delicious. Their guacamole is some of the best I've tasted in SF.", "author": "Eva L."}

Tacolicious seated us in the patio right away to start the meal on a good note!!\nBetween my friend and I, we shared a pitcher of Sangria, Grilled Squid Veracruz, tacos carnitas and rock cod as well as fried plantains!! Most of the recommendations came from our server and none of these disappointed. The squid was exceptional with its flavor and not chewy at all! We also got a hot sauce with our chips which was amazingly addictive. The tacos carnitas are not to be missed whereas the tacos with the cod is just about ok. For anybody who enjoys plantains, its an absolute must with its crunchy and sweet flavor!! We also got two of the Pasion Chupitos which were on the house. I would highly highly recommend Chupitos over Sangria for tasting. The habanero tequila was spicy and smooth at the same time and definitely gave me a buzz!

We had to sit outside because it was crowded, but it was heated so it turned out well. The meal started with chips and salsa, which were delicious, we probably went through about 3 bowls before meal the started. The salsa was not spicy, but very flavorful.\n\nOne of my friends suggested we try the chili con queso. The menu said, \"Sustainable? No Local? No Delicious? YES\", which immediately triggered my pseudo hippy food tastes and made me skeptical. When it arrived, it turned out my skepticism was well founded because it was just a bowl of the nasty liquid cheese they pour on \"nachos\" at the sporting events with some peppers floating in it. I had some anyway because it cost eight dollars! I wanted to get my money's worth.\n\nThe tacos however were a saving grace. You can get 4 for $13, which although it doesn't beat the deals on mission street, these tacos were much less greasy and don't seem sketchy. I recently turned pescatarian so I had 3 fish tacos and a veggie one. The fish tacos, which featured fried rock cod, were really good and the veggie one was surprisingly flavorful to the point that I didn't really miss the meat. The provided a spicy, mild, and medium sauce to accompany them, but definitely did not give enough for four hungry college students.\n\nOverall I would return if in the area, it's a pretty good deal for the Marina and definitely more flavorful than you're average place in the neighborhood. I would deduct a star for the awful/weird cheese, but this is something I would never have ordered myself because I know I don't like it so it keeps the 4.", "author": "Nicolas H."}

I'd heard for awhile that they make some great tacos and that it's fun, so I'd put it on the \"must-try\" list to include in my upcoming book, \"Food Lovers' Guide to San Francisco\". \n\nhttp://amzn.to/my7MHz\n\nWhenever possible, if I'm going to try out a new place and if it's fun/casual, I'll try to share the experience w/ my friends.\nNo, I didn't tell you I was here for the book. That shouldn't make a difference -- we're customers.\n\nI get it -- I have a large group of 10 with me and it's not easy seating 10 people. \n\n\"It's going to be about an hour,\" says the hostess. \nI ask if we can go across the street to Horseshoe Tavern and wait; can she call me when our table is ready? To this, she says she has no phone service.\n\n\"No phone service.\" A young lady of that age -- has no phone? \nOr Tacolicious has no land line?\n\nWhatever. \n\nAll good; I'm agreeable and then tell her we'll just check in then, but kindly request for her NOT to give away our table as we will, quite literally, be right across the street waiting. She says she will let us know when the table is ready.\n\nFast forward almost an hour and a half with ten hungry people trying to calm down our stomachs with some heavy beers -- and there's no update, no nothing. Two friends run across the street to check and they're told: \"It's going to be about an hour.\" \n\nSurely, she must have not recognized them and is mistaken?\nNow *I* run across the street to check -- and am told it will be another hour, at least. Now, my blood begins to boil.\n\nG: \"That's what you said an hour ago, and you're now telling me another hour?\"\n\nHost: \"Yeah well, no table for ten has opened up.\"\n\nG: \"I'm sorry - - you were waiting for a table of ten to get up to seat us -- when you have no set-up inside for a table of ten right now?\"\n\nHost: \"Well, if a four-top opens up, I have to seat the four people waiting.\"\n\nG: \"So, basically -- you told us to wait an hour when there was NO possibility of us being seated in that hour because you don't HAVE a table for ten in the restaurant.\"\n\nHost: \"No, if an entire section got up and ten seats opened up, I could have seated you guys but everyone is finishing their meals at different times.\"\n\n....... are you joking? I have better odds playing craps in Vegas than an entire corner of one restaurant with tables for two, four, two and two ALL getting up at the exact same time so they could be PUT together!!\n\nDo you think that people just have time to kill on a Tuesday night, closing in on 9 PM, hungry but patiently waiting because YOU said to wait?\n\nLike I said - I understand that it's a large party, but after this length of time, I want to see SOME effort having been made to accommodate a party that arrived at 7:30 PM. \nBy 9 PM, it'd have been nice to see her having saved at least two itty bitty tables in one corner, in an attempt to cater to the guests who have been waiting for an hour and a half, or SOMETHING -- anything. \nBasically, we just sat across the street watching some 50-60 people getting seated in that span of time -- and she had done NOTHING -- not even to inform us that it's not going to happen tonight until 11 PM -- NOTHING to help us.\n\nG: \"So - - basically, after another hour, you can tell us it's going to be one MORE hour.\"\n\nHost: \"Maybe - but I don't see the wait being longer than three hours.\"\n\nDon't stop reading -- it gets better.\n\nHost: \"Well, if you made a reservation, you'd have been seated.\"\n\nG: \"RESERVATION? I thought you don't take reservations.\"\n\nHost: \"We do - if you e-mail us the number of people in your party.\"\n\nG: \"Your website clearly states, \"NO RESERVATIONS\" --  doesn't that mean you don't take reservations?\"\n\nHost: \"We don't -- unless you e-mail our GM and then we will reserve a table for you.\"\n\nSeriously - -what is this?\nAre you toying with me?\nYou think these 10 people who all lead busy lives had nothing better to do tonight than wait an hour and a half while you did NOTHING?\n\nI could have lived with you informing us that our chances were slim to none, and to make a reservation for ten on a different night -- and all my friends would have been all too happy to go somewhere else to eat. But no - you decided to waste all of our time so that by the time we went to Barney's and ate there -- it was past 11 PM on a weeknight when we walked out because you had to be completely incapable of doing your job.\n\nI appreciate good food more than most, but part of a restaurant experience IS the service. Good service can make up for a lot -- but Tacolicious, however good/bad your food may be, which I will never know now -- you need to train your hostesses not to waste your customers' time, be upfront, and make sure not to ruin ten people's evening! \n\nAnd if you're going to state \"NO RESERVATIONS\" on your website - don't tell me when I get there that I should have made reservations!\n\nI ask again -- are you kidding me!?!!", "author": "Grace K."}

Picked up tacos for the office from the Tacolicious stand at the Ferry Building last Thursday.  We got a bunch of chicken and short rib tacos.  They were excellent, so I decided to give them a shot at their actual restaurant in the Marina.\n\nTo begin, the chips and salsa were on point.  Chips were warm and tasted fresh, not store bought.  They gave us four different kinds of salsa which were all pretty good (they have no spicy salsas though! They gave us a \"habenero\" salsa that was incredibly mild.)  For our appetizers we went with the tuna tostadas and albondigas soup.  The tostadas were pretty good.  They were these little round chips with a small piece of tuna and leeks over mayo, topped off with a slice of avocado.  While tasty, they were actually pretty difficult to eat.  One bit and the whole thing falls apart.  The albondigas soup was pretty mediocre.  It was particularly oily and we ate maybe a third at best.\n\nWe tried the agua frescas, which were pretty disappointed.   The flavor of the day was a lime aqua fresca that ended up tasting more like minute maid limeade.  There were no fruit pieces or pulp in it whatsoever.  Go to underdog if you want a real tasty aqua fresca!\n\nIn order to get a good feel for their variety of tacos, we went with 2 braised beef short rib, 1 shot and beer braised chicken, 1 fried local rock cod, and 1 white shrimp (special of the day.)  The short rib and chicken were both wonderful.  They were very juicy, tender and flavorful.  The seafood tacos (fish and shrimp) were both quite disappointing.  Neither had any flavor, and they both left fishy tastes in my mouth.  Neither the fish nor the shrimp tasted fresh.\n\nIf I were to come here again (be willing to spend 50 dollars on a Mexican lunch) I would stick with only the chips, salsa, short rib and chicken tacos.  Those are all very good; don't waste your time with anything else there.  Or you could just go to the mission and get 10 super burritos for the same price...", "author": "Timothy C."}

Short rib, fried cod and chorizo are all solid if not memorable, and the carnitas was outright boring, to the extent that fried pork can bore. Tacos are $4, with various discounts if you buy a bunch, but they're completely overstuffed with meat. The refried beans with cotija are really nice - pick these over the drunken beans.

Got some drinks and food served right there.\n\nThe place is also pretty loud, so I'd not think this would be great for dates.\n\nThe food was pretty awesome as well.  It changes from time to time.  The first visit had spicy meatballs.  While that's typically italian, the fusion was pretty amazing.  Unfortunately, they didn't have that (or the beet salad that I'd had before).  I wasn't too disappointed, and had a great meal anyway.  \n\nLooking for something fun and super tasty, swing by!", "author": "Andy S."}

Like manzano peppers, guava, prickly pear, agave nectar, red chill pepper vinegar, elder flower, and sage. Somehow it all magically turns out awesome!\n\nUnique entrees:\nTheir complimentary fresh salsa is great. The chili con queso is awesomely delicious!

I tried two types - the short rib and the carnitas.  FIrst of all it's $12 for four small tacos and boy are they small. The size actually was a blessing in disguise since they did not taste very good. The filling is way too salty particularly the short ribs. It's as if someone made some sort of meat stew and filled the tortillas with the bottom remnants of of the pot - extremely concentrated pieces way too salty to be in a taco.

The interior is reminiscent of a casual sports bar.  A whole variety of liquor stood behind the counter, and the television was broadcasting sports.  I was fortunate enough to come at 3PM when it was quite empty because it became busy by the time I was leaving.\n\nFor those not ordering drinks, they do provide you with your own pitcher of water.  However, I do prefer the waiter to refill my water for me instead, especially since he had the time to approach me every minute, asking if I have anything else I need to order as I'm eating.  I felt like they were rushing me to pay and leave, which made me uncomfortable and unable to savor my food to their fullest.\n\nNo matter what you order, Tacolicious does provide you with a generous portion of tortilla chips on the side along with salsa.  I could tell from just a taste of the zestful salsa that it was made fresh in the kitchen.  After reading about their famous tuna tostada, it comes as no surprise that the tostada was what I ordered, and it did not disappoint at all.  The combination of tuna, avocado, and lime served in crispy tortilla shells was a rich, savory, sensational delight.  If you could order anything from the restaurant, do choose this.\n\nTacolicious is the perfect place for people to grab some drinks, chips, and tostada while chatting and watching the games, provided the service quality improves.", "author": "Fook W."}

My favorite is by far the chipotle-braised pork shoulder taco. (Confession, I love pork). When ordering, don't forget to help yourself to a generous squirt of one of three sauces. Sweet tomato is my fave.\n\nDripping with sauce and flavor, be careful when you eat it! \n\nYou also HAVE to try the grilled corn with an ancho-chili rub with lime.

I've never heard of this so I asked the server what it was he said, \"it's just a sweeter chicken.\" So I got it, ate it, realized it had peanut in it, which I am very seriously allergic to. I asked the server if it had peanut, he replied, \"I'm not sure, I know it has some sort of nut, let me ask the chef.\" HMM... This is something a server should know!! Secondly peanut dishes always state so on the menu, I can't believe this wasn't the case here.\n\nAnyways, I had one of my worst reactions, barely made it to the hospital in time, and had to spend 12 hours in the ER.

I'm Mexican and I grew on on the US/Mexico Border and there's nothing like a taco with a California twist.

I was a bit skeptical of this place given its name but my boyfriend was super stoked on coming here so I went put all my opinions and judgments aside and went with the flow and I'm glad I did! Super friendly and attentive service from the moment we walked in. The place is a little tight inside and on my way to the ladies room I think I spotted a patio. Had we not been pressed for time we for sure would'vr explored the menu a little and definitely would've ordered cocktails. The guacamole, ahi tostadas and tacos (cod, carnitas and the special: cochinita pibil). The guacamole did not disappoint. The ahi tostadas were rich and delicious. The combo of the ahi, avocado and chipotle mayo made for a filling bite for lunch. The tacos were accompanied by different salsas. The tacos were all tasty. The cochinita pibil lacked pretty much all of the traditional flavors of the dish, but the meat was super tender so we can't complain. I sipped on an agua fresca and my bf ordered the horchata which was super tasty and made fresh. The atmosphere and vibe is fresh and fun. The music upbeat and our server was a delight.

Humanely raised and organic ingredients as opposed to questionably sourced mystery meats.  Flavor experiments like short rib tacos instead of the generic list every taco truck in the Mission has.  A long line to order that moves at an OK pace followed by a 15-20 minute wait after ordering.  Some complain, I use that time to buy fruits, veggies and other treats from the rest of the market.\n\nShort Rib Taco: A very thin smear of finely pulled short rib.  Extremely salty, so the portion is probably appropriate for the amount of tortilla, though the last bite felt like there was only tortilla left.  Would have been nice to have some less-flavorful beef mixed in to give it more meat  while still piggy backing off the intense short rib flavor.\n\nChipotle Chicken Taco: Chewy and charred little niblets of white and dark meat chicken.  Tastes like it had been marinated a very long time.  Tasty as far as grilled chicken goes.\n\nShot-n-Beer Pork Shoulder Taco: Not like carinitas, but still had a m\u00e9lange of textures.  There was the very tender meat which must have been braised forever, gelatinous gobs of fat and chicharr\u00f3n-esqe crunchies.  Probably my favorite taco of the three.\n\nCorn On The Cob: The sweet, watery corn is contrasted well with the salty and tangy rub and the sour lime.  Could have been warmer, I mean the less sophisticated street fair corn-on-the-cob may not have as complex a flavor but at least it's fresh off the grill.  I saw a tub of pre-grilled corn that they warm up on the griddle. \n\nNachos: Fresh salsa packed with an array of ingredients.  Chips leave more to be desired as they're too thick which makes them too crunchy and absorb too much grease.  I do like the coarse salt on top though.\n\nAgua Fresca: A light blend of minced nectarines, lemon juice and water.  A much better alternative to those Mexican sodas with crazy amounts of processed sugar.  The straw was made of paper, which I appreciate from a green point of view, but it falls short on usefulness.

This isn't yo mamas taqueria joint. This isn't the mission filled with hispters. This isn't where you should take your friends for a cheap beer and tacos. This is a restaurant. In the Marina. You shouldn't really be shocked at the $3 price tag for tacos.\n\nThat being said. I loved it here. We came on a Monday night and it was packed. We wanted to sit in the front window so it was about a 20 minute wait but we all got a pitcher of margaritas at the bar and tried to talk to one another (so loud!). We were finally seated at our table of choice and started with chips and salsa and guac and the queso dip. Oh my god. I died. I'm sure it's about 5639126745 calories. But it was my birthday night. And I did not care!\n\nI ordered the Tuna Tostada. Jesus. I died! The tuna mixed with the avocado and crispy tortilla melted in my mouth. I would have gotten a second order if I wasn't wearing such a tight top. No joke. I ordered the rice and beans as a side and they were a bit on the hot side. Just how I like it. I tried a shot-and a beer chicken taco which was great as well. I also snagged a side of broccoli which was prepared perfectly.\n\nIn terms of service, I'm sure it's always great it just seemed like the host we had was new.. or wasn't used/comfortable with working in large crowds. Which made me think she should REALLY consider switching from hospitality. She wasn't rude per se, but also wasn't very helpful when we asked her any questions. One of the guys working there recognized my boss and took care of us the rest of the evening and he was great! \n\nGreat first taste of Marina. And a great restaurant", "author": "Amanda S."}

The seared ahi tostadas might just be my new favorite food in the city. \n\nThe place is tiny and since there is only one bathroom you end up waiting in line for like 30 minutes, but it's a great opportunity to meet people if you're cool like that, so maybe they know what they're doing.\n\nThe drinks were great, the wait staff was friendly (our waitress was super cute), and it's funny watching the staff navigate the crowds with armfuls of dishes in the limited space.\n\nI didn't get to try any of the other tacos, but I've been told that they are incredible and I am definitely looking forward to making the trip there again. The parking in the Marina is terrible, but this place is definitely worth it!\n\nP.s. if you want a story of lost love, I developed a little crush on our waitress. Sparks flew, emotions ran high... she actually talked to me man. I gave her a quick back-rub (which I don't think her manager appreciated) and then she walked out of my life forever.

The atmosphere inside is fun and loud, but not too overwhelming or pretentious.  Their ambient music only adds to the fun and young vibe, with a great soundtrack to back your delicious food.  \n\nTheir sangria with apple chunks in it is divine!  The tacos have just a little something extra that you can't describe, but they are definitely worth the slightly higher price tag.  Also, each taco filling is easily enough to fill both tortillas, so you basically get two for the price of one.  Well worth the trek out there!", "author": "Veronica B."}

The problem is they don't pick up their phones so you have to order on-line, which would be fine, but the website that hosts the actual ordering is horrendous.  It seems so basic yet it's been so spotty and frustrating to use, so I end up having to email the order to info@tacolicioussf.com and to my surprise, the General Manager responds almost immediately!  \n\nSo I sent my order and listed my time for pickup, but I got tied up at work and was about 40 minutes late picking it up.  The bag of tacos (with all the yummy salsa) was ready, but the GM said the food sat around too long and it wouldn't be any good.  She insisted that they redo all the food so it's warm and fresh - who does that anymore??????  And it was my fault for being late!  A waitress offered me a beer at the bar, and viola, within 5 minutes the freshly cooked tacos were ready to go.  Truly amazing service.  \n\nI loved this place before for the food & ambiance and now love it even more for its service.", "author": "Y W."}

That annoyed me! Why, in all things that are sacred (especially in a crowded place like this) would you have ONE bathroom! A line was going around the bar. Doing waaaayyyy to much! \n***I felt like we, as in the customers, were literally on top of one another! The table next to us, was super overcrowded.

Tried it, wasn't too impressed.  Small and expensive.  \n\nWe started off ordering some margaritas and some mixed shots.  Delicious!  For entrees, we ordered 2 sets of the platter of 10 tacos to share..total of 20 among 4 girls.  Slightly disappointed by their quality of meats.  Sure, they were big chunks, but not the taste I was expecting.  I was paying $30 for 10 tacos, which is an average price, but not the typical average taste I can get at any other Mexican places.  \n\nDecided to come here a couple more times, which was probably better since I arrived during happy hour time, totally beat the rush!

Tacolicious totally delivered on my demands. \n\nEmpandas-Not my favorite, the outside wasn't crispy enough but the filling was good.\n\nPan con chocolate.- At this point we were stuffed but I was off the rails in terms of being reasonable. I read about Spanish Pan con Chocolate in Amanda Hesser's \"Cooking for Mr. Latte\" and I've been romanticizing the idea ever since. I mean can you imagine? Toasted bread smeared with chocolate, a tiny bit of olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt? I've been thinking about it FOREVER and it totally lived up to my obsessiveness.\n\nVerdict: Is this the cheapest Mexican food in the city? No. Is it the best or most authentic. Probably not. Is it totally awesome in it's own unique way? Heck yeah! Do I command that you immediately visit Tacolicious and eat tacos without delay. Yes I do! And please for the love of all that is delicious, take me with you...", "author": "Emily P."}

After all, I started wearing lululemon and I have a few pairs of designer jeans.\n\nBut the people just drive me nuts.  I mean. who likes eating dinner next to a big group of loud, drunk Marina guys who were elbowing each other, talking so loudly that we couldn't hear ourselves, and eventually shoving each other into the sidewalk?  And seriously, it's July in San Francisco, which means it's cold.  Who wears plaid shorts, a tshirt, flip flops, and sunglasses at 9 PM?\n\nBut other than that, I actually enjoyed Tacolicious, especially because I was in good company (not the frat boys).  The chicken and the carnitas tacos were delicious.  Both were already seasoned well enough that I didn't need any additional salsas or sauces, and all I did was squeeze a lime over the carnitas taco.  They were stuffed so I had to eat a bit of the meat with a fork before I was able to pull the edges of the tortilla together.\n\nOverall a great dining experience.

Now, I am not a huge taco fan, but I've enjoyed several of theirs.  The Petaluma Chicken and Chorizo & Potato were quite tasty, and I LOOOOOVED the short rib taco.  Tacos also come with three delicious salsas:  a green avocado-based one, a brown, smokey-tasting one, and a yellow, much spicier habanero one.  (The habanero tends to be a little hot for me, but I really like the other two.)\n\nThe margarita / cocktail selection is also far superior to most other sit-down Mexican places I've been to, from the basic house margarita to more creative pseudo-margarita concoctions like \"Tickle Me Telmo\" and \"If Honey Could Drink\" (both of which we enjoyed enough to order a pitcher of, btw).  Lots of places try to get away with charging $9-10 for a margarita; I think these are actually fairly close to worth it.\n\nI wouldn't give it four stars because, in spite of the fact that there are a couple of tacos there I'm happy to eat when we go, there are too many other spots, even Mexican spots, in the same price range where I'd rather eat, given the choice.  (Plus, it's in the Marina, which means a long-ish drive, hunting for parking, and the occasional bevy of drunk-n-rowdy 'bros breaking glasses and bellowing along to Weezer while you try to eat.)\n\nStill, the refried beans are tasty, the ceviche isn't bad, and we really enjoyed the fresh-made guacamole, so I certainly don't go hungry when we're there.

The name \"Tacolicious\" brought to my mind an image of a dinky dirty hole-in-wall spot where the tacos are good but you're just not sure what is in them.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, don't get me wrong - there are PLENTY of taco spots I love exactly as I just described.\n\nWhen we walked up to the place on Saturday night around 8pm, I was quite surprised to see a classy facade with little patio tables and heat lamps set up right outside.  You walk in there's a hostess!  And she tells us there's a 45-minute wait.  My friends insisted it was worth the wait, so we decided to go in and get drinks until our name was called.  As you walk inside, you notice how hip and trendy the place is right away, completely betraying the image its name called into my mind.  There is lounge/jungle house music playing and people drinking margaritas out of fancy glasses.  The place is trendy.  It is no dive by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nWe were able to squeeze in and get our margaritas, which were perfectly made.  Right by the bar is also where the tacos are prepared so we watched as they threw together taco after taco after taco, trying not to drool into our glasses.  The food looked absolutely AMAZING.  Not more than 30 minutes passed before the hostess came and grabbed us for a patio seat.  With the heatlamps on, the temperature was perfect.  I ordered 4 tacos total: canitas, chicken, short rib and carne asada (i THINK).  My two friends ordered only two tacos each.  The tacos seem small but they are stuffed to the brim with meat and very little else.  On my first bite, I literally sighed aloud of happiness.  It was delicious.  The meat was so tender and juicy and bursting with flavor.  I loved how simple it was - no cheese or lettuce or tomatos that I can recall.  Just simply meat and a little diced onion.  I wolfed down three and could not eat the last one, which one of my friends gladly helped me devour.  Of all the 3 that I ate, my favorite has to be short rib.  WOW, it was delicious.  Our tab was a little under $60, and that included 3 shots of premium tequila.\n\nWe seriously considered going back there the next day but they had other restaurants they wanted me to try before I headed back to Vegas, so until next time I'm in SF, I will just have to settle for dreaming of those delicious little tacos from time to time.", "author": "Mandi L."}

This would've gotten two stars but they lost 1 star for the rude service we received!\n\nMy friend and I (both asians) came here during the NBA finals to grab some tacos because he has been raving about for some time so I wanted to see what it was all about. Of course the place was packed! But luckily for us there was a small table for us squeezed between two decently big groups. \n\nWe sat there for a good 15 minutes before anyone even came to ask if we knew what to order. We thought it was okay because maybe since its kind of busy so our waitress was tied up. So finally after 15-20 mins she came and got our order. We each got 4 tacos for $12 and a pitcher of the sangria. \n\nI ordered the braised short rib taco which was REALLY REALLY dry and over packed with meat. traditional carnitas tacos also very dry and the petaluma chicken taco which was also dry. i didnt even bother to eat the cod taco because it was deep fried and i was just disgusted by the look of it. \n\nSo the food was a bit of a disappointment but the service was worse. Our food came fairly quickly but while we were alread eating our food the white wine sangria we ordered did not even arrive yet! Usually I would expect the alcohol to be the first thing to come because it is obviously the easiest. And we were unable to get our waitress's attention at all. We had to end up getting the bus boy and let him know and he went at got our waitress. When she finally came with our Sangria she did not even look happy pouring it to us. And by the way the sangria was a rip off! it was not that great tasting and super small compared to places like cha cha cha...\n\nat first we didnt think anything of how horrible our service was UNTIL they sat another party next to us, and it a big part of about 8-9 older (30-40s) caucasians.

Anytime we needed anything we basically had to ask the bus boy! \n\nI've never felt so discriminated against and had such bad service at a restaurant ever.

I seriously could have polished off an entire bowl myself but social norms dictate that I HAD to share. *grumble*\n\n We split 4 tacos - the vegetarian option, the fish, the carnitas and the chicken with mole. All were stellar but i think due to the fact that the veggies, the carnitas and the chicken were all so strongly flavored, the fish came up slightly short. I love fish tacos so I would say in the future go for the fish, then the vegetarian, and then either or for the carnitas and chicken with mole. \n\nTwo gripes: 1) the wait is pretty crazy. I came in once on a Sunday afternoon (there was a game) and it was completely packed. 2) The reason why 4 tacos for 2 people worked was due to the fact that we were 2 ladies who don't really eat that much.

Food is exceptional and comes out promptly without compromising flavor nor presentation. The tortilla chicken soup has a great hearty broth and is great for the soul in such a way that gingers should stay far away from this delicacy. The carnitas taco is some of the best carnitas you will taste, there's no shame going to town on 3 or 4 of these just like there should be no shame in going to town on yourself mid afternoon. I recommend both on your lunch break. If you really want a treat, try the Jack in the Box tacos, home made mock up of those Jbox tacos you used to get late night drive thru 2 for a buck, theyll remind you of that last resort (big boned) girl you had sneak in the back door at 3am in college but didnt tell any of your friends about, except this time your going to want to tell everyone. And If you do switch hit, play ball and try a beet and goat cheese salad or a veggie taco, both have a wide array of bright and colorful veggies, but might leave you feeling unfulfilled. Most likely cause youve never indulged in some fresh tuna. For this, the tuna tostada is of highest of recommendations. Nice raw fleshy pieces of tuna tossed with soy sauce and lime juice, paired with a chipotle crema, avocado and fried leaks, this tuna might challenge your fiance's fish when prepped at its finest, and before you know it, this food outing quickly may be turning into your first affair, or your second. After your done devouring down on that tuna, your quickly looking for another taco to munch on, but you need something to counter that salty briny tuna, and your looking for something a littler darker and sweeter, perhaps more forbidden. Boom, the chocolate taco. The homemade chaco taco for desert. Handpressed waffle shell with fresh vanilla ice cream, fully dipped in chocolate.

Really yummy salsa. Chips on their own could've probably used more salt, but with the salsa it's perfect.\n\nI ordered the asparagus/potatoes/garlic/mushrooms taco and the enchiladas de pollo.

Seriously way too much food, but they were both great: traditional churros and laiola's pan con chocolate.\n\nI think the portions here are pretty generous and the prices are all more than reasonable.

My friend had ordered the 'moss' (non-alcoholic containing passion fruit, pineapple, and sparkling lemonade) and it was very tasty, so I imagine their cocktails are all awesome as well.\n\nI think the name 'Tacolicious' is a bit misleading in that they really have a lot more to offer than tacos, and I'm not sure I'd say their tacos are even the best food items on the menu.

Best drink of the night for me thought was the Pasion...so so tasty if you love passion fruit.  Cocktails are $9 which is not outrageous but also not wonderful.  Oh guy friend pointed out that you have to look at the beer prices to know if a place is overpriced so just for reference they have Modelo on tap for $5.\n\nOn to the food.  Food was good.  Probably not better than the Mission or some taco trucks but authentic enough.  Favorite of the night was the tuna tostada...pleasantly surprised that the tuna was served raw and just love the big hunk of avocado.  Also had the plantains and the ribs...both okay, friends seem to really like the jicama salad that came with the ribs.  Tacos were not skimpy on the meat and came with 3 salsas that were good.

One beer later, she was at the bar's door, letting us know our time had come.\n\nWe were seated at the bar, and I don't know if it was because of our serendipitous location, or because we were two girls coming in already a bit loopy from a few hours of day drinking, but we were treated like queens!\n\nThe waitstaff, and especially Head Chef Telmo, were exceedingly accommodating with all of our drunken requests and questions. We came for the tuna tostada, but wound up being wooed by a number of other tasty bites on the menu. You really can't argue with their special - for $10, you get a taco, a beer, and a shot of tequila. \n\nI'm not really one for tequila, but the food was superb. Spicy upscale taqueria food at its finest. We each had a taco - I had the carnitas and my roommate had the fried cod - and while I can't speak for hers, mine was a little slice of street taco heaven. They come with three dipping sauces (a mild avocado, medium chipotle, and a hot habanero), but if you have the inclination, ask for the \"white lightning\" sauce. I'm not sure what was in it, but it's for those who really want to test the strength of their GI tract. \n\nWe also split the plantains appetizer, but the real star of the show was that tuna tostada: crispy corn tortilla, spicy aioli, tuna tartare, and large slices of avocado. The spice was never overwhelming, and all of the flavors complimented each other well. \n\nBy the time we wandered out of Tacolicious close to 11, my roommate and I were in general inebriated agreement that it was our new favorite Mexican place in the city. Flavorful spicy food, fantastic service, and an early contributor to the oft-repeated phrase spoken the following morning, indicative of a great night out: \"I am never drinking again.\"", "author": "Devon S."}

I found this place on yelp and really wanted to check this place out! This is such a fun place to go to and I am definitely excited to spread the word about this place and bring my friends here for a \"taco night\". \n\nWho knew tacos could be made to taste so good? The good thing about this place is while you are waiting for your food to come out they give you fresh chips and salsa. The waitress probably thought I was a pig because I finished the basket of chips and got more! The salsa had such a unique flavor to it that it was so addicting to eat.  I ordered the 10 tacos for $29. The original tacos and the filet mignon were my favorite 2 taco types to get. The bad part about getting the filet mignon tacos is that you pay an extra $3 for every filet mignon taco you get, but let me tell you it is definitely worth it! The meat was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and was tender and so juicy. The meat that was in the original tacos were just as good. I like that they put just amount of meat in the tacos so everything is not pouring out when you take a bite into it. Also, they use simple ingredients to make their tacos, but it is so flavorful and literally tastes so DAMN good. The sauces that the tacos came with were such a good extra to add to the tacos! \n\n10 tacos were probably a little too much, since I could not finish, but it was a better deal than getting 8 tacos for $24. The way the tacos are placed on the dish makes it too good to eat! I think I took so many pictures of it to savor the moment. Every time I look at my pictures of the tacos it makes me hungry and more excited to come back! The name of the restaurant sounds so fun!!", "author": "Katrina T."}

That's the vibe I got when I walked in. Contemporary. Ironically, I came here with my co-workers during lunch. \n\nIt was around 11ish-12pm and the place was about 50% occupied. We were a party of 5 so didn't have to wait.\n\nWhen we sat down, the table was a bit small for 5 people so we pulled the table next to us closer.\n\nThe food is enjoyable. There is a good amount of meat. The free tortilla chips w/ salsa were addictive! I believe we cleaned up 3 baskets of it. The salsa was good but would've been better if it was spicy.\n\nMy only criticism was that our server had a bad attitude. It was more of an aura that we felt whenever the server would check up on us. \nThis isn't something that would deter me from returning to this place. I figure, we're all human and we have our good and bad days. I understand.\n\nOverall: A nice place to mingle with friends over some tacos, if you're around the area. I'm a fan of the classic taco shops/restaurants so I could be a bit biased in my review.\n\nIt's worth to check out.", "author": "Jason N."}

Dark wood, nice looking bar, awesome high top tables near their large open windows, great outside seating(great for people watching) and large tvs. When my fianc\u00e9 and I first arrived at the restaurant it was packed and all they had was outside seating. It was a little cold out but they have heat lamps so that we ended up sitting outside. There was a football game on so it was nice to be able to watch the game while sitting outside.\n\nSERVICE: the customer service was excellent. Everyone was really kind and made us feel welcome. Even though it was their lunch rush, we did not feel like we needed to rush through our meal. As soon as we were seated our server immediately brought over chips and salsa, waters and asked us what we would like to drink. I asked the server which margarita was his favorite and he told me the Thyme Margarita. I'm so glad I got it! It was delicious! He also recommended tacos for us to try (they are served a-la-carte so you can choose many different types which is nice) The server was really great and we never felt pressured to leave. Even after we had finished our food and paid our bill, the server brought over another basket of chips and salsa so we could enjoy the game  and our margaritas for a bit.\n\nFood: My fianc\u00e9 and I each ordered two tacos and that was plenty for us for lunch; he had the carnitas taco and the braised beef short rib taco and I had the fried local cod(which you can also get grilled) as well as the veggie taco. The tacos were served on white dishes and on the side were 3 different types of salsas. \n\nOverall: Service was excellent. Prices were good.

(Nighttime however, would likely entail commingling w/drunken marina crowd, so do at your own peril.)\n\nNOTE TO TACOBAR in Pac Hts: Listen up, this place has two critical things that you, Tacobar, lack: (1) tacos with actual flavor and (2) free chips & salsa (delicious too, i might add).  I left satisfied, w/a fully belly.\n\nAMBIANCE: Two of us came here for a late lunch on Saturday, approx 2pm, after a brisk stroll along Crissy field (wearing workout clothes/running sneaks, but didn't feel out of place).  The place was packed, but we got seated within 5 mins. While it was rather bar-like/rowdy inside, thankfully we got a table vs. bar counter that made it less marina d-baggy.  I can only imagine what a scene this place is at night (pass!).\n\nFOOD: \nTacos: ordered 4 (chicken, pork, beef, fish) and was pleasantly surprised. First, they pack a lot of meat into those things (w/the exception of the fish taco, which wasn't as meaty) so they are dense and filling. Meats were savory, tender, juicy. I loved that the tacos come w/a tray of 3 little salsas. Each taco tasted different and had its own seasonings/flavors.\n\nChips and Salsa: Free is good.  But better is that they tasted good! Big ass bowl of delicious salsa, not your typical salsa, a bit more finely purreed, some different herbs in there. So if you're not too hungry, the chips/salsa and a couple tacos will do the trick without breaking the bank. \n\nFried Plaintains: Sweet delicious.  A bit heavy though.  Nothing stellar.", "author": "Caroline I."}

We came here on the 7x7 100 eats list to try the beef short rib tacos. We were pleased because when we arrived on a saturday afternoon there was no wait at all and we got a seat outside on a sunny day so that was nice. The service was quick and pleasant. We tried the tuna tostadas which i had heard were amazing and I was really disappointed. The tuna was ok, and the sauce was good, but the onions on top were too big to be crispy (flash fried i think?) and they just made the texture of the overal dish weird. I love tuna and normally any place that has a good tuna dish will end up getting lots of return business from me - but i wont order this again it wasn't very good. \nThe chips and salsa were good, and on the house so that's always a good sign for a mexican place to me (i hate when they charge for just basic chips and salsa). \nThe taco - obviously - their specialty. The beef short rib taco was our favorite. A very good spice to it, cilantro, onions, yum! I wished I'd ordered another one. The taco of the day was a shrimp something - blah, i didn't like it, not enough zing - tasted too buttery or sweet or something. The cod taco was excellent. I will definitely order that again, I loaded it with lots of lime, i love fish tacos with lime! The chorizo potato taco was much more bland than I'd expected. I really like chorizo, but I guess normally its just a lot more spicy and zing, this taco was neither and the potatos just made it blander and drier, don't waste your appetite on this one, it's not that great. Stick with a few of the cod and a few of the beef - they are the perfect compliment to eachother. One spicy and saucey the other zingy and creamy. \nI know I'll be back to try a few other flavors.", "author": "Audrey V."}

Tacolicious has a seemingly simple and obvious concept, but they do it well with a lively atmosphere - plus they provide an endless bowl of salty freshly fried chips and tasty salsa.  The place can get pretty crowded, but that is true for any decent place in the city.  If you are not waiting for a meal, then you probably don't want to be eating there.  \n\nI had four tacos ($12), and picked a variety since this was my first time.  My favorite was the beer battered rock cod, it was fried to perfection and tasted great with the green salsa.  The chorizo potato was surprisingly delicious - the potato provided great texture.  The carnitas was pretty good, but it was a bit sweet for my taste.  The beer braised chicken was my least favorite, but I am never really a fan of chicken tacos.  There is also a rotating taco special (this time it was fried calamari).  Not only do you get a big bowl of salsa for your chips, but accompanying the tacos comes a platter of a red, yellow, and green salsa.  I didn't have anything to drink, but the drinks that went by looked beautiful, and the bartenders were working their heinies off.  \n\nAnd you have to love the ten foot high Tapatio mural.", "author": "Dana H."}

I'd stay away from the chicken as its ok but nothing like the mouth watering, drool inducing taste of the meats mentioned above. The waitstaff are normally friendly and the atmosphere is fairly lively though normally packed with people. There are a number of TVs around showing various sports games or ESPN.\n\nLastly the salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is quite good, its got a distinct chipotle flavor and definitely better than the cheap salsas you get at other places.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-07-16", "description": "What's the big deal? Perhaps I'm expecting too much. I can't claim to be an expert on tacos but I've eaten quite a few of them having lived a hop, skip & a jump from the mission district. I am also quite willing to drive cross town to get freshly made corn tortillas at Las Palmas and go miles out of my way to hit the closest Mi Puebla to get a better assortment of fresh chiles and banana leaves. That being said, I would have to think twice about even walking across Chestnut Street to get a taco here. \nFirst off, this is not a taco restaurant. This is a bar that happens to have a kitchen that can make you a taco or two. There is no civilized seating in the whole restaurant. It is either at the bar or on bar stools on high tables, all with no back support; high communal tables with bar stools on one side and high bench seating on the other; or finally a small cubby hole that is crammed with 6 diners, sharing each other's conversation and body odor on a banquette with a couple of steel chairs that are as uncomfortable as that sounds. Yes, you guessed itl. That's where we sat. \nNext the food, we ordered a starter, the fried plantains which were tasty but cloyingly sweet, more dessert than appetizer. Had to have the partner kill off most of it as I am not a sweets (or sweet) person. After a couple of bites, my teeth were hurting. At $7.70 a small serving, I couldn't recommend it at all. We ordered 8 different tacos. All were passable but none stood out. The meat was uniformly dry. The exception was the cochinita pibil, braised short rib and the carnitas which instead of moist, was oily. The carnitas I expect to be a bit oily. But the trade off is usually that crispy and crunchy pork that is for me the joy of carnitas. None of that here. In fact, we were hard pressed to figure out what meat was what meat on our plate. We had to ask two different waitpersons to identify which was what. Not a good sign. We did figure out what was the veggie option on our own. It was full of corn and peppers but I was hard pressed to see any of the promised summer squash or chard. Still it was tasty and, I can't believe I'm saying this, was better than most of the meat options. The rock cod taco was the other identifiable taco thanks to the overly heavy batter. The fish was bland and unremarkable. The beer braised chicken could have been any mystery meat, it tasted a bit cinammony which got tiring fast, even given the size of the taco. The best in the line up was the chicken mole colorado, good flavor but again plagued by dry chicken. Except for the orange oil slick that accompanied the beef short rib taco, it would have been the star in a bad television series, but I still can't get over all that oil. The corn tortillas themselves were pretty pedestrian. I'd expect the mass produced tortillas in the mission taqueria but they only charge 2 bucks at most. With more pesos you should get something more. Generally, the tacos needed a stronger hand with the spices. The free chips and salsa was just okay. On one of my trips to the restroom to wash the oil off my hands, I saw a waiter dig into the chips with his hands and fill a basket just after he handled the bill and money from another table. Yuck. I guess it was lucky that no one bothered to offer to refill our chips.\nLastly the service. It started out almost irritating. Two seperate staff asked for our order when we were still strategizing. Then we put in our order, the beers and food came and then we became invisible. No water, beer, chip refills. No one checking on us, we had to ask for help. No, it wasnt busy at all at that time as we were the only ones in the cubby hole. \nIn summary (finally), Nah.", "author": "bongo c."}

Any outside dining in the city is fun and that, accompanied by their adventurous options, makes for a perfect SF lunch.  Here's the breakdown from my experience:\n\nFried rock cod:  Simple white fish flavor as you'd expect.  Being fried gives it that satisfying crunch to each bite.  The crema they join it with is what'll make you really like it.\nShot-and-a-beer braised chicken:  Shoulda asked what liquor and what beer.  The flavors didn't hint at much but its shredded presentation gave it that taste of Mejico.\nTraditional carnitas:  Very true to its name.  Very good, but nothing out of the norm.\nCochinita pibil:  Like I said, adventurous options.  I never had or heard of this before.  I really liked the acidic taste to it although it left it just a tad dry.  At first, because of the fiery color, I thought it would be spicy.  The waitress told me that was anchiote.  For the white people who don't know that is not spicy lol.\nGuajillo braised beef short rib:  Now THIS  was a taco that could make me sing, or cry, or both simultaneously.  Guajillo is a barely medium hot pepper at best, but its berry overtones latch onto the short rib like wings on an airplane and make it soar.  I honestly think the next time at Tacolicious I will order just this.  \n\nI have yet to dive into anything else there other than the tacos.  It's quite a lot and with the numerous sauces they break out with your food you will fill up.  But if you don't order what you like you may find the price unfair.

Indeed, Miette is number #49 on the list and, a block away, it's a must.  Ginger snaps are apparently the thing...little did we know that this would become a day of searching for a more things on the list that we could enjoy.", "author": "Tamar D."}

I was surprised at how bland the food is. It looks yummy but there's hardly any unique flavor - neither Mexican nor San Franciscan.\n\nI got the chicken and beef short rib tacos. There are cooked onions in the taco but you can hardly taste them. For garnish they give you a couple slivers of peppers and carrots.\n\nOn my chicken I put the guacamole-tomato green sauce. For the short ribs I put a red looking tomato based sauce that has two X's next to it. There was another sauce with three X's but I assumed that it meant \"hot\" so I didn't want to venture those waters. These sauces do add more flavor to the tacos except you pretty much have to drench your tacos in them to make up for the blandness. The sauce with two X's was hardly even spicy or hot so I don't know what those X's mean. It didn't even reach Tobasco levels. I wish I tried the XXX sauce. Actually simple Tobasco would've been nice.\n\nOne of my short rib tacos was really fatty. I really didn't mind it since it at least added some flavor and moisture, but I can see a lot of people having a problem with this. The second short rib taco was rather dry. It tasted like I was eating mostly tortilla. The chicken was fine but didn't taste like much.\n\nEach taco is $3.5. You can get 3 for $9 but it still will hurt your pocket. After eating three tacos I was still hungry! I don't even eat that much plus I had breakfast. Afterwards I bought a huge sandwich and finished it.\n\n____\n\nBoring. I applaud trying to be a community organic taco spot, however, Tacolicious didn't even meet the standards of a typical Mexican street vendor. I hope this was a freak accident. For now I'll stick to my cabeza tacos and extra hot salsas.\n\nFUN FACT: Did you know that one of the founders of Tacolicious is an editor of 7X7 Magazine? Fun, huh?", "author": "Michael H."}

I simply had too good of a time and left feeling too content with the world that tacolicoous is always going to have a positive connotation to it unless I go again and am eaten by cannibalistic hipsters. \n\nBack to the review, that atmosphere can best be described as cozy. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! (a good sign) but were still able to find this little corner of where we still felt very close and where it was easy to talk. I should also mention that the table next to us was a family of four and no one seemed to mind the kids antics and the staff seemed to handle them easily. It just seemed like a place that was easy to have good time.\n\nOn to the food. The girl and I split 4 tacos. Combined with the chips, this proved to be the perfect amount of food for a smallish dinner. And good god it was satisfying. The place just oozes quality. The chips were thick, tasty, and substantial. Not those thin generic things you get at some places, but really tasty chips. The salsas were all great. The standard house salsa had enough spice to keep it interesting as well as enough stuff in it to make it feel like you are eating something that is just liquefied tomatoes. The ones that came with the tacos were all wonderful as well. The green one especially was just aaaaamazing. Again, quality. \n\nNow for the tacos. We had 2 cod, 1 carnitas, and 1 short rib. The cod ones came with a nice big piece of deep fried cod, but were fairly typical except for the generous amount of fish and garnish. And while I say typical, I mean high end typical, one of the better fish tacos I have had, just nothing fancy in terms of flavor. \n\nThe carnitas were excellent. The meat was well seasoned and lingered on your tongue without being to dry or oversalted. When mixed heavily with the salsa it was an excellent flavor that just left you wanting more. \n\nThe short rib one tho, put all others to shame. Its flavor crushed the other two and was just amazing! Incredibly good. It had that wonderful. Just the amazing rib flavor mixed that mixed perfectly with the tortilla and salsa. GAh! GREAT!\n\nThen there's the price. We got a beer and the 4 tacos so the whole tab was $17! All in all I felt great after eating here. \n\nTacolicious is just pure quality. I loved it. I mean even the napkins and tortillas just seemed to be of a higher class then other places. I was just blown away by how good the food was, and how content it made me.", "author": "Tom O."}

If you do the 10 for $29, Price is pretty good.  Carnitas was both very tender and tasty.  Yet, my friends were not impressed, but mentioned that it taste like a typical carnitas.  However, I like their soft taco and like that they don't mask their taco's flavor with heavy sauces.  Instead, the sauces (spicy,medium,mild) are place on the side for you to add.  This allows you to focus on the substance/meat itself.\n\nAmbience:\nGood.  Noisy.  Very tight space.  I guess this is due to the fact that my table was located near the bar/waiting area.  Other than that,I had two bad experience on the wait.  First time, the whole dining area was reserved for a party.  I guess this happens, but I wish they would indicate this on their website.

Ok, so it might have been oil. Doesn't make it any less yummy. \n- Chaco Taco was no imitation - stuffed with quality vanilla bean ice cream wrapped in a fresh waffle cone and covered in hard chocolate. Are you hungry yet?\n- Got everything to-go, so can't comment on the place itself, except to say it was busy at the bar and outside seating is limited on the sidewalk. Looks posh. \n\nIn depth:\n\n- Not really much to say, except that they give you a heap load of salsas if you want. I recommend the dark red one if you like chipotle smokey stuff, and the green one if your normal and just want some kick in your dish.\n\n- Overall, I give Tacolicious 4 stars because it was totally perfect for my mexi-craving at 9 PM.

I grew up in Tucson, AZ and am skeptical of places that boast a Mexican food menu but have a clientele that looks more fit for a French diner. \n\nMy boyfriend and I stumbled upon Tacolicious after a passerby recommended it to us. We were hungry and didn't want to wait the requisite 45 minutes for a table so, we opted for two seat at the bar. This was a great idea because we got to admire the cooks as they created guacamole from scratch! \n\nThe service was fantastic and very fast. The chips, salsa and guacamole were delicious. We ordered sangria, a staple in our lives, and it surpassed our expectations. Per our awesome servers recommendation, we got three different types of tacos and they were each incredible! \n\nSince that day, we have gone back several times and always brought friends in who never leave disappointed.

This last Saturday I had friends from out of town and I wanted to something different with them. We decided on a drinking bike tour and Tacolicious was at the top of my list. We arrived that place was packed as usual, and we were lucky with seats as we went in two ladies had just left the bar and we scooped up their seats. We sat right in front of the bartender and still waited a good 10 minutes before finally being acknowledged and ask if we wanted drinks. I understand maybe they're going for the laidback environment but when the bartender is more concerned with getting his own drink on than the customers I think we need to reevaluate the business model. We were offered chip and salsa that for some reason NEVER arrived and at the point decided that food was out and we'd be moving on to our next stop.

We had intended to go to a more homestyle taqueria across the street, but we looked over at Tacolicious and saw that crowd eating at outdoor tables and thought it looked more interesting.  The 3 of us ordered 8 tacos (carnitas, chicken, short ribs, cod) and a side of \"drunken beans\".  They immediately brought out chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp and the salsa very fresh and unique -- very tasty.\n\nThe food came quickly, and with it they brought out 3 more salsas to put on the tacos:  mild (green), medium (red) and hot (yellow).  All were flavorful and good.  The tacos were generally all excellent -- served on two layers of small corn tortillas -- not huge portions but more than you might think for \"street tacos\".  Only the cod was a bit disappointing, in that there was too much breading, so the deep fried aspect of this overpowered what was actually good fish.\n\nOverall, good service, very good and unique food and a trendy setting.  More expensive than your typical Mexican food place (our bill for 3 with no alcohol was over $40 before tip), but worth it for a nice lunch or dinner with friends.  Don't compare this to eating at the taqueria across the street.  I would definitely go back.", "author": "Fred E."}

I was a little disappointed that none of the salsa were that spicy, but they all had great flavor. Of all the tacos we tried, the braised beef and the carnitas were the best. The braised beef was so tender and perfectly cooked, and the carnitas tasted great with a little lime juice and avocado salsa. The chicken taco, which came the most highly recommended, was a little underseasoned for my taste, although very tender as well.\n\nThe thing I liked best about this place was the street-style tacos that you can't always find.

Perhaps even great.\n\nAll of the tacos we had were fantastic, the best being the short rib, the chicken, the carnitas and the chile verde.  The chorizo was badly overcooked, but still tasty, and the cod was really underseasoned.  The cod was, however, easily fixed with a healthy dose of their AWESOME habanero salsa.  Served up with fresh and fantastic chips, excellent service and crazy inventive tequila-based cocktails like the pasion (habanero-infused tequila with passion fruit), which was the best, followed by \"if honey could drink, \" which was a tequila-cucumber-citrus concoction.  The spicier drinks were also excellent, but I generally lost interest in them after the first few sips because they were not terribly drinkable.\n\nAll that, and they had crayons and a taco truck color-in for the kids.

It probably helped that it was a Friday evening, but thats besides the point. Chips, salsa, and hot sauce came out pretty quick. The chips were light and the the salsa had plenty of flavor. The 3 different hot sauces were distinct. The yellow one, i imagined to be a fresh mango based sauce. WRONG. It was probably the least enjoyable of the 3. \n\nI got 2 of the Braised Beef tacos, carnitas, and the \"shot-and-a-beer\" chicken. All of them were excellent. The beef and carnitas were very tender and didnt have too much fat/grease coming off of them. They were very tasty and did not disappoint. The chicken was honestly nothing special and I put the most sauce on this one to get it how i wanted. Probably the second best thing about these tacos is that, while pricier than some other tacos, they had very healthy servings of meat on them. They were in no way some skimpy $1 tacos with a teaspoon of meat. These were the big boy tacos. So much so that 4 was too much for me.\n\nThe tickle me telmo margarita was very well made. Not strong at all and no flavor was too overpowering. If you are loooking for quantity of alcohol, shot + 24oz corona + taco for $13 is a pretty damn good deal.\n\nOne gripe I had was that the bartenders and servers seemed to ignore me.

There's always a special of the day or of the week, i forget, well, the margarita pitchers probably didn't help for details...\nOh and their stools fall easily! beware!", "author": "Damien J."}

Street parking or I'm going to Mel's Diner. \n\nThey have a special daily that is $10 for a taco of your choice, a shot of tequila, and a tecate. Not bad!! I get this if I am not too hungry and want a quick buzz. Otherwise, I go for the yummy cocktail concoctions. My fave is If Honey Could Drink. As far as the food, I liked the cod tacos best and carnitas second. I found the short rib taco really greasy. Tasty, but greasy. Probably wouldn't get it again for my heart's sake. The salsa and queso is really good! I liked the minty-ness of the salsa and the queso has those pickled spiced carrots in it. \n\nThe wait is pretty long but you get your food fast.  If you can, sit at the bar while you wait for a table. Staff are friendly and very attentive.  It's a good spot to go with friends. Not really a date spot cuz it can be loud in there.", "author": "Mel G."}

However, although their tacos can be unique, I almost prefer the tacos that I could get at a real Mexican place for a third of the price. Don't get me wrong, their tacos were good but when it comes to the quality-to-price ratio, I would say that your average taco truck or hole-in-the-wall Mexican place has a better deal. Besides, it's like trying to make pork rinds fancy.....it just doesn't need to be upscale-ish and they're good the way they are.", "author": "Rylan C."}

I think that I was immediately put off by the fact that the bartender acted like we were crazy when we ordered a pitcher of margheritas for four of us - I was looking forward to a good  drink after a long day.  I quickly realized why he implied that this wasn't enough when they brought over a small carafe of weak margherita that was primarily filled with ice.  We could barely fill our 4 glasses with the amount and it was $30.\n\nMy friend and I started with the ceviche.  For some reason it reminded me of tuna salad - I think may have been the combo of the fish-y taste and the apples (which sounded good in theory but didn't blend well in this case).  \n\nI was excited to try the tacos - I tried the fish, veggie and beef.  All were mediocre.  There was nothing bad about them, they were just slightly boring.  The beef was the best by far.  \n\nMy other two complaints are\n1) They served saltine crackers (in the wrapper) with one of their appetizers.  I'm sorry, but this is just not cute - it seems down-right tacky if you ask me.  \n2) 1st round of chips were on the house but the basket accommodated approximately 10 chips.  I made a joke that our chip bill at the end would be $30 with all the refills we had.\n3) Service was not friendly.  The only person that demonstrated any kindness/joy was our busboy.  The waitress seemed extremely crabby.\n4) I thought I could handle the Marina crowd - but the combo of the restaurant which seems to be trying too hard and confused about its image, and the overly-made-up, white crew there made for a less than optimal experience.\n\nOverall - this restaurant left me craving some REAL Mexican food, and at the very least, some decent white-person Mexican like Nicks.

Several crowded outside tables overlook Chestnut and inside there are some high topped tables against the window and against the wall. It's a long, narrow space with a bar. Not a good place for a long, quiet meal but a good place for quick, flavorful food.\nWe sat in the window for lunch.  The meal starts with a pitcher (well a glass bottle really) of water, chips and a sweet pineapple I think salsa.  Very tasty with just a bit of spice.  The menu offers six or seven types of tacos, several sides like two kinds of beans, corn, rice, etc. and then a variety of other entrees including ribs, enchiladas and guacamole.  \nWe decided to stick with their namesake and ordered four different tacos: we had chorizo and potato (dried out and not very flavorful), braised pork belly (very tasty, moist and lightly spiced), chicken mole (just not quite there), and fried cod with aioli (tasty).  The tacos are served with three salsas: a hot yellow salsa (which, unfortunately, is not very hot) a medium red salsa and a mild green salsa.  They need a hotter option.  All were tasty and for the chorizo taco necessary to add flavor.\nWe also had a couple of glasses of wine, but the prices were a bit high for a place of this caliber. The wine should not cost more than the dishes.\nThe drunken beans said they included pickled vegetables but I did not see any pickled veggies in them. They were tasty though and were very well cooked, not firm or soggy.\nIt's a good place but a tad expensive.", "author": "Vivek V."}

It seems this place is trying to be a refined spot for authentic, traditional tacos.  Unfortunately, the food is average (3 stars),  overpiced (minus a 1/2 star) and won't call you when your table is ready after you put your name on the list (minus 1/2 star).  This is your typical average food, overpriced restaurant in the Marina. \n\nMy fiance and I had guacamole to start and it was very average.  I think it needed more cayenne pepper.  Rosa Mexicana has better guacamole.  The margaritas were REALLY strong, so you're definitely getting your $$ worth.   Unfortunately, I'm not really into margaritas so I focus more on the food at a Mexican joint. \n\nWe then ordered 7 tacos: 2 filet mignon, 2 carnitas, 2 fish, and 1 short rib.  The filet mignon was okay but I wish it was cooked medium rare.  No way was it worth the extra $3 per taco, so insanely overpriced.  The 2 fish tacos were good, but nothing out of this world amazing.  The carnitas tacos were average.  The short rib was dry. \n\nThe problem with an upscale taco joint is that it's hard to improve on simple cheap tacos.  There's nothing to justify the increased price.  That said, I was completely stuffed and my fiance and I definitely would have been fine with 5 tacos between the two of us. \n\nNo need to return.", "author": "Katie S."}

The grilled fish tacos and guacamole were up to par, and I would recommend them if you find yourself at a tacolicious! \n\nLet me start off by saying that I rarely venture to the marina because it is mostly out of the way from where I live, and just honestly avoid trekking here because it's not where my friends are, fave restaurants, and the common attitude of \"I'm better than you\"\nSeems to be inescapable. But today I decided to come here because it was beautiful out, and what better thing to do than get some tacos and sunshine! When my friend and I arrived (it was her birthday, btw) we had thought about getting tacos to go because it was so rad outside, and the hostess came back and told us we had to order at the bar. Ok, no problem. We got to the bar and realized, hey, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to stay and eat here. The guys behind the bar were hilarious and really nice, and when I went back to the hostess to ask for a menu, she glared at me and snapped that We had to get out of the way so they could clean the area (there were 5 open bar stools), and once she brought over menus we could sit down. There was no line, and no one coming to clean, so after 5 minutes we just sat down. Once we did, she brought over 2 menus and 2 other guests instead of helping us, and just kept on giving dirty looks to my friend and I (which the guys behind the bar were noticing and scoffing at just as much as we were). Because of this, we ended up getting our stuff to go because we didn't want the hostess ruining the rest of out beautiful afternoon. \n\nWord of advice to the management team: keep your team in line. Repeat customers don't happen if your hostess thinks she is better than a customer, and her nasty attitude was a huge turn off. I won't put up with it, and I won't be back.", "author": "Maija W."}

So, you'll have to wade through the mass of post grad yuppies to get a good taco.  We were 2 of the three non-standard Marina types in the whole place.  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!  \n\nFood:  NOM NOM NOM\n\nService:  Nice and down to earth.   \n\nThis is a great place for tacos.  I simply can't explain the poor service or the less than stellar reviews.  \n\nWe walked into a packed joint and immediately were greeted and placed our names down for a table.  The hostess gave us 40min, which is fine since Circa was on the corner and we grabbed a pre-dinner drink.  When we came back, some other people were sat before us further down on the list so she sat us at the bar right away.  Thumbs up on service. \n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar at the two spots right before the entrance to the kitchen.  We got lots of attention from the servers since we were right there and got to watch as they prepared the food.  Both of us are LOCAL SF FOODIES, that means we eat LOCAL food and were BORN AND STILL LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO.  No, honey, you can't call yourself from the city if you weren't born here and don't still live here.  We're just different from you, don't feel bad. \n\nAnyhow,  we ordered the 10 tacos, 5 each, we skipped the veggie and the filet.  We ordered the drinks that were just OK but the tacos made up for everything.  The cooks were awesome.  You can watch them skillfully prepare the food with very fresh ingredients from the bar.  We were impressed and by the time the tacos came, we were totally ready to dive in.  All the tacos we ordered were awesome except for the chorizo being a little salty.. but it's chorizo.  It's salty.  So, that's not really a problem.. just a preference.  I won't order the high sodium blood pressure killer that is the chorizo taco again...even though it was tasty.. OK.. maybe I'll have a bite of yours next time, but I'm not eating another one.  Maybe.  Let's just say we went through plenty of water and were stuffed by the end of the meal.  \n\nThe desserts looked absolutely awesome and were eager to watch them prepare it.  So, we were gonna go for the froo froo desserts on the menu but when we asked the server, he pointed us to the traditional churro and the flan.  He was cute and it didn't take much.  FRESH churro with mexican chocolate and NUTELLA flan it is. :D  THEY WERE AMAZING.  Ok.. so we watched the cook make our churros 3 times cause he wasn't satisfied with the way they turned out.  Professional with high standards.  I like that.  It took a little bit but it was worth it.  The churros were hot and crispy on the outside, soft gooey yumminess on the inside covered with cinnamon and sugar.  PLUS, you get to dip them in thick mexican chocolate.  I'd add a little cayenne pepper to the chocolate to give it a kick but that didn't stop us from devouring the churros before they got a real chance to cool. On to the nutella flan.  This was not as good as the churros but honestly, we were stuffed and it was good enough for us to finish the whole thing seriously doing damage to out waistlines.  Creamy and so smooth and OMG NUTELLA in FLAN!  Thank you for hybridizing these two winners together to create a completely sinful dessert.   \n\nYou should do this.  Really.  Go do it now.", "author": "Marie L."}

So, the first time I visited Tacolicious I was less than impressed. Seeing as how I don't eat meat, I opted for the fish taco (fried fish... meh) and the vegetarian option. The fried fish taco tasted like a big ball of fry batter -- I still am not sure that there was actually fish hiding in there. I left and swore it off for a while. Whenever someone would suggest Tacolicious, I would be quick to provide another option. When my sister came to town, though, I wanted something somewhat central that provided a fun vibe and somewhat reasonable pricing. I think Tacolicious falls into both of those categories. There was a good 45 minute wait when we arrived, but no matter - we posted up at the bar and grabbed margaritas while we waited. Having learned from my previous mistake, I made sure to order the veggie and the shrimp tacos when we were seated and was much happier with my decision. We also started with the Marina girl salad and I was very impressed -- it was a huge salad and was delish for $10 or so. I would order that by itself next time I go in. Big fan. Our service was friendly enough and the vibe was fine (though, not gonna lie... it seemed a bit douchier than I remember). Plus the location makes it easy for post-dinner drinks.

It was a little ridiculous - we were told that the wait would be 1.5 hours, but it ended up taking around 2 and even at that point, we couldn't get seats together. When we were waiting, we decided to get drinks at Circa which is next door. We wanted a table that sat 7, and finally we were given an area where 3 people could sit and the other 4 had to stand around. We started out with chips, salsa, guac, and margs. The margs was TASTY - they were strong but you couldn't taste the tequila. We finally got seated around 10:20ish and ordered the chile releno (yum), veggie tacos, and the homemade cheese. Make sure you don't get the homemade queso - not good. It's really sweet and is served with a few chips, which I thought was random.

The tortillas were authentic and the best part of the taco for me. \n\nThe Salsa has a unique minty flavor which we all loved- and the guacamole was also perfect. Skip out on the ceviche- it needed more lime marinating and flavor. \n\nOverall, great food at a cheap price (wayyy cheaper than Mamacita's) and a golden spot to enjoy a Tecate Tall Boy.", "author": "Rena Z."}

I agree with the laced-with-crack guy because once I get started on the short rib tacos, I come back again and again in a week. I even tell my husband I'm \"jonesing for some short rib tacos and rice\" -- not to mention the complimentary tortilla chips, which RULE ALL. I have yet to eat on premises, but it's a great take-out place if you're local. You can order on-line and pick it up in half an hour, which is tough to beat. The only thing that would make this place more dangerous is if they delivered! Then I would eat here 3x a week for sure.", "author": "Diane C."}

I've been living in the city since the Fall of 2008 (I go to USF) but I'm from Orange County (this has a purpose). My mom sent me a clipping from the LA Times with 20 places under $20 and Tacolicious was one of them. Intrigued, I went with my girlfriend to partake. Being from Southern California, I hold my standards for tacos and Mexican fare rather high.\n     Let's just say I was blown away. First of all, of the three menus brought to you, only one side has food. The rest? Beer, wine and tequila like mad. I was impressed. When we first sat down, they brought us some chips and salsa. Mighty tasty and definitely not afraid to bring more when the first batch has been polished off. Now, those tacos.\n     They have a weekly taco special (duck confit when I first went) and then a sampling of simple 'taco truck' tacos as well as a myriad of other plates. Don't let their simple construction trick you. These tacos mean business. Especially the carnitas. I'm usually a carne asada guy myself but, with some prodding, my girlfriend persuaded me. Whoa. Cooked with mushrooms (not my fave but in this instance, a miraculous combo) and topped with cilantro and diced white onions, these babies pack a punch.\n     The perfect way to top them off? The house-made guacamole and qu\u00e9so. And of course the house margarita. It's a bit steep ($9.50) but it's well worth it. It's an excellent blend of tequila and mix without one taking over. You really need to drink one to know what I mean.\n     Still need a reason to go? Their 'prix-fixe' menu? Well it's a taco, a can of Tecate and a double-shot of tequila. Straight-up impressive.", "author": "Luke H."}

But I let me friends convince me to try this place, which was easy once I walked past the outdoor seating and had a long, rude look at other people's food as they tried to ignore the intruding stares of passers-by.   The tacos struck me as large and tasty-looking, so I humored my friends and tried it out.  And I am the first to admit, they were great!\nI got 4 for myself (I like to ease into things slowly): beef short rib, carnitas, cod, and chorizo.  All of them were awesome except the chorizo, which was just pretty good.  Apparently they make the chorizo themselves, no easy feat, but nevertheless the other 3 were more enjoyable.  The meat in the carnitas and beef tacos was juicy and soft and tasty, and the fried cod taco was everything you would want a fish taco to be; nice crunch, juicy white fish, and good fixins.\nWhile you wait for your tacos, they bring you bowl after bowl of really good chips and salsa, and pitchers of water.  I have heard that the service can be quite rude, but had the opposite experience; a server who was very patient as we ordered in the most inefficient manner possible. \nWe had to wait about 25 minutes for our table, which was fine since there is a good bar across the street, and the hostess even said she would run across and get us when our table was ready (though we came back a little early to save her the trouble)! But a very nice gesture if you ask me.\nI would give 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't.  And I can't put 5 because according to Yelp that means \"as good as it gets\", which for me is still the old school taqueria.  But I was very pleasantly surprised by this place.", "author": "Sam C."}

The best tacos i've ever had in my life. I loved it! The drinks went really well with the food. We had so many shots of passion and some picante drink. They were both very exotically spicy. They weren't too strong considering i had 9 shots. If i ever had 9 shots of patron or 9 shots of any other shot i'd be  passed out on the floor wasted. So, these shots were not too strong.

As cheesy (or Americanized) as it sounds, it was actually pretty damn good. Best carnitas I've ever had (so far). And this is coming from a person who was raised by the Mexican border. I know good Mexican food like the back of my little hands. The menu is pretty small so you're not overwhelmed with choices. I chose the 4 tacos for $12. I had 2 traditional carnitas, 1 house-made chorizo potato, and 1 shot-and-a-beer braised Petaluma chicken. All very good. Except the chorizo may have been a little bit over cooked. But some may prefer the smokier taste. Whatever they use for the marinate is brilliant! The chicken taco was pretty flavorful because it just soaks up the marinate better than the other meats. I also tried some of my friend's cod (fish) taco, which was my least favorite. It was more breaded than it was fish. You can't go wrong with the the traditional carnitas. Goes great with a Pacifico on a warm day.\n\nThe place itself is pretty hip and modern. They have a bar for people who really just want to get down and dirty with tacos and alcohol. The atmosphere is great. It just gets pretty crowded during brunch hours on a Sunday and seating is pretty limited because the place is not very big.\n\nOverall, a great place to hit up before or after a nice stroll in the Marina or Golden Gate Bridge.", "author": "Mary Anne R."}

The menu is pretty light, they have 6 different kinds of tacos, a few soups and salads and 4-5 apps.  Before I knock the place, let me say that the tacos were really good, small in size, but very flavorful and tasty.  Two of us split 10 tacos which was plenty of food for the two of us.  They have several homemade salsas that were good, however they only gave us a minimal amount of each (ie less than an ounce) and if you like putting salsa on tacos, be prepared to ask for more, especially if you're eating more than a few.\nWhile our server was polite and friendly, she wasn't on top of her game.  Granted it was busy and she was helping the table to the left and right of us, but it took a while to both get her attention, especially when she was talking to either table next to us, and the bill took seemingly forever.  She apologized and I know she was trying so I don't want to say the service was bad, just a little slow.\nMy biggest knock of this place is the drink prices.  I'm sorry but $7 for a 24oz. Tecate is pathetic.  This costs no more than 1.50 at any liquor store and the fact that they are charging this much is sad.  They also have a spicy beer which basically is hot sauce and a lime on top of a tecate, which is very good if you have never tried it, but it too is $7.  Give me a break, Paxti's charges $2 for a tecate shows you that you can in fact make a profit for charging a modest price for a cheap beer.  The other cocktails are around $9 with nice ingredients which is probably about average for the Marina.  The draft beers are served in skinny pints (not 16oz) and are $5-6.  \nOverall, the food was good, but the menu seemed to be way more drink oriented then food oriented which is fine if you want to go get a drink and a light snack.

Overall, the tacos were good - I actually think the tacos in Mill Valley at Joe's Tacos are better - they have the little extra something that makes them great. \nThe appetizers looked really good but we didn't order any. I'll come back - a fun place and fairly affordable.", "author": "W D."}

Had the Yucatecan special tacos with black bean tortillas, shrimp, avocado, and cilantro. Very tasty. Only problem was that I thought it was $4.95 for 3 but it was $4.95 for one taco. So it ended up being an expensive lunch. But definitely tasty - as a Mexican food aficionado I plan to return. Too bad it's on the other end of town.

Also for some reason, the water was really good (don't know why, but maybe it was the cool bottles it came out of).\nThe food itself was solid. Definitely not the best I have ever had, but I did learn a cool trick before going in to maximize the food you get. Every taco is served with tons of whatever meat (or meat substitute) you order, and it comes with two tortillas. If you simply remove the bottom tortilla, you can split the meat up between the two and almost get two tacos for the price of one.", "author": "Brady C."}

The veggies were ok, but my wife liked them more than I did.  Our least favorite was the chicken, which was a bit dry for something that was cooked in sauce.  We really enjoyed the three salsas that came with the tacos.  I really liked the chipotle and the habanero ones!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-28", "description": "Came here recently on a Wednesday and I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. Here's why: \n\n4 stars for the food: I had the chorizo, chicken and filet mignon taco. Each one was to die for..the flavors had such great taste (chicken was a little spicier than the others) and they're filled with a big chunk of meat. I tried the guacamole too and it was great. The chips were tasty too but needed more salt.\n\n3 stars for the service: I was told that the bar seats were first come first served and as soon as I saw people get up and leave, I went to take their seats. There were two bartenders and one of them made eye contact with me but did not greet me. I sat there for a couple minutes with dirty dishes in front of me and watched them take a shot ( shot #1). When they were finished taking their shot, one bartender came to get the dirty dishes and greet me, also handing me a menu. He didn't even wipe the counter of the crumbs and the left over taco bites left from the previous people..I didn't bother saying anything. I ordered my food and a margarita de la casa. It was way too sweet, sweeter than a margarita should be. I decided not to say anything again and see how the rest of their service would be. I got my food very fast (and was put in a better mood by how tasty it was). I used the chipotle sauce they gave to put on my tacos, and I tried to ask for more but the bartenders were again, too busy in their own world. One was watching TV and the other was putting glasses away. Then comes shot #2. I sat there appalled at how they were taking another shot (keep in mind they just took one when I first arrived) and how other customers like myself, were waiting to get their attention. I gave up on asking for more sauce and instead finished my meal to get out of there. The only thing that the bartender was timely with was giving me my check when I had asked. \n\nSo there we go, 3 stars for service and 4 for the food. Will definitely come back, just will not sit at the bar. I will have to wait a good 30 or 40 minutes for a table, which seems the best way to go given my experience here. They should really watch how much the bartenders drink because customers can see them doing it and even interfere with their ability to make drinks.. Maybe that's why mine was too sweet.", "author": "John S."}

It does get loud inside on friday afternoon by 5:30 and is packed and bustling. There are limited larger tables, many 2 tops and a long bar with lots of seating. We wanted a table for 4 and the hostess was able to seat us at the bar until our other party members arrived 30 minutes later but we couldn't take up valuable table real estate without all four people present. She was very helpful. \nThe drinks are yummy, especially the house margarita, and the cold beers, not so much the house sangria. All of the items on the food menu are delicious. My favorite is the shot-in-the-beer-chicken tacos. The tacos are small but they fill you up and they are really well spiced and reasonably priced. \nThe menu is pretty limited to tacos and a few starters, which is actually kind of relieving because it makes it easier to choose and everything is good. The pulled pork tostadas were also tasty, much like the carnitas tacos but on a toasted corn tortilla rather than just a warm corn tortilla. I recommend getting a selection of tacos so you can try several. \nIt also has outdoor heated seating which is fun in the afternoon.", "author": "Jessie B."}

Here is the thing - the Marina Girl salad is one of the best salads in SF right now (though it pains me to order it).  \nCombine that with a side of broccolini and a beer braised taco and I am very happy and bordering on healthy.\nBonus for the kids is free ice cream included with their meal.

I'd been wanting to try Tacolicious but being that is in the Marina, home of the douche and slutty girls with babies and JUICY pants, it wasn't high on my priority list. For starters, their chips and salsa were perfect. The salsa was different than most places- very fresh, almost herbal, but not entirely from cilantro. We ordered some guacamole and sitting at the bar we watched them make it from scratch in a big bowl of avocado heaven. I would take that job for minimum wage just to make guacamole all day. It was fresh and bright, I didn't even mind the few tomatoes. I just keep scooping it into my mouth. I ordered the squash, corn and chard veggie taco. IT WAS AMAZING. Very fresh, well seasoned, beautiful veggies. The tacos come with 3 sauces, I couldn't stop with the salsa verde, which I believed had avocado, it was super creamy, and fire roasted tomato/chipotle, dosing each bite. My bf ordered the chile relleno, again watching them make it was delightful, they even fried it in a separate fryer from the meat products. The relleno was stuffed with rice and zucchini rather than cheese, but it was equally as fantastic. Crispy outside, fresh inside, perfect tomato sauce, a sprinkle of oaxaca cheese on the outside. You could make this pepper a meal. I wish we would've had time to explore their alcoholic offerings, but I was pleased with my hibiscus lemonade.

We went with the short rib taco, Taco of the week, Veggie squash taco, and the Deep fried Cod taco (Wasn't our favorite). I don't mind paying $$ for good food so Id say the prices were pretty good. The service was pretty good as well (Though your seated very closely to the table next to you on the bench side of the table).

They serve everything with a side of three house-made salsas, which were pretty good.  I'm usually a spice girl, but I thought the flavor of the spiciest salsa was just okay.  It was the mild avocado one that I liked the most, and I didn't like the medium salsa at all--it reminded me of a mole sauce, and I don't like mole sauces.

The carnitas was tasty, but the chicken was mediocre.  Overall, for the price, this place is not worth returning.  The pricing is similar to Mamacita and the food and atmosphere at Mamacita is way better.", "author": "Carolyn D."}

The tacos are really tasty, and the prix fixe deal of 1 taco, 1 Tecate, and 1 tequila shot is a good way to start off your night in the Marina.", "author": "Jason G."}

Boy, very glad we did. Super friendly and efficient staff (lots of folks walking around making sure that you have everything you need on your plate or in your glass). The place was hopping on a wednesday eve at 9,  and we sat at the counter. The drink lists looks very nice, but we were good children and stuck to Negra Modelo on tap. The salsa they brought us was one of the best I've ever tasted (was that fresh mint?). The chips were crispy and just-made;  salty enough to make the cold Modelo Especial go down very easy. We each ordered 3 tacos which were presented on a long plate and show up with an assortment of salsas. There are all types of combos to order, as well as dishes other than tacos, but this being our first visit we wanted to get down to business. My favorite taco was the one with potatoes and chorizo, but we also had some pulled pork and chicken which were excellent, topped with fresh salsa and vegetables. Super fresh tortillas, everything is assembled and made to order and it's clear the quality of the ingredients is the best;  most are locally sourced. Everything was filling but with a very 'clean' and fresh flavor to it (I keep writing 'fresh', must be something about that food). No stale oil here.\n\nTacolicious clearly grew out  of the same sophisticated and knowledgeable palate/vision as that behind defunct Laiola, except it's actually better. Laiola never found its niche customer base in that neighborhood and eventually suffered for it.  Tacolicious on the other hand appears to be enjoying a well-deserved Marina love-fest, which means it'll be able to survive. Yay. I didn't mention the price, but this is actually a very reasonable dinner/drinks option. Would definitely recommend it and will go back. \n\nPS Tacolicious has a stand at the thursday Ferry Plaza farmer's market if you want to try the goodies before diving in.", "author": "Rebecca P."}

He insisted we go here instead of the Taqueria across the street because this place looked \"trendy\". I was a bit confused when we walked in because I didn't know if we waited to be seated or just sat. We just sat and eventually we were helped. They brought out some oily nachos with a pretty good salsa. But I was so dissapointed when I saw that they only had ONE vegeterian taco, BOO. SO I oredered only the one taco. The taco was delicious at least, and I know I will crave it from time to time, and those three salsas they serve are bomb! I also got a jamaica lemonade, it was bleh. My mom makes a better one! I would give this place 4 stars but just the fact that they only had ONE veggie taco brings it down one star. I mean c'mon we are in SF there are so many vegeterians and vegans here it only makes sense to accomodate us. But I guess one taco is better then none!", "author": "Peeta B."}

It seems that they have turned some things around because I enjoyed it.  We sat outside and started with margaritas made with 100% blue agave tequila, lime juice, and agave nectar.  I had the carnitas tacos and thought they were pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend this place for authentic Mexican fare, but for a casual dinner out with friends or loved ones, this place isn't bad.", "author": "MIKE S."}

First was Carlos, the waiter.  They were packed!!  He was hugely helpful with the menu and actually kept me from over ordering, which I really appreciated.  Also, the tostada with tuna, which he suggested, was awesome.  Then came Manny, the busser.  He was on it!  He kept the drinks filled, chips loaded, and salsa fresh.  He was super polite and always stopped to make sure we were okay, despite the packed crowd.  All in all, their positive attitudes stood out to the extent that it became a conversation starter between our table and the table next to us.  Yes, they were that positive and helpful that we both overheard each other talking about it.  They made the experience great!!!  I will be back soon - not because there is a shortage of restaurants, but because the staff and food were both off the charts.  It is nice to have a great place in the marina with such a great attitude.", "author": "JonnyBoy K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-16", "description": "Finally checked this place out.  We had a sample of tacos and the pork tostada.  The pork tostada with cabbage rocked but unfortunately the tacos fell short.  The cod taco had no flavor (which is odd considering it's fried).  The chicken and beef were just so so.  The salsa served with the chips has a very different flavor and not something I have ever tasted before.  It's ok but nothing to write home about or return for.  My margarita was very good but I only had one and ended up with a throbbing headache.  Hopefully I didn't pay $10 for crappy tequila but who knows.\nThe service is very good and they refilled our chips a few times which is appreciated!\nIf I am going to pay top dollar for tacos I still think Mijita in the Ferry building does a WAY better job at fried fish/cod tacos and their chips/salsa and other tacos are also 10x better and bigger bang for your $3-4 bucks.  Tacolicious is obviously a great place for drinks and a quick bite, especially if you can get outdoor seating (indoor was nice too).  Not sure when I will return but I recommend stopping by if you are in the hood.", "author": "K L."}

I went to the Ferry Building to meet a friend for lunch at the Slanted Door, but got there early when the Thursday morning farmer's market was still open.  A good thing I'd skipped breakfast, because there was the Tacolicious stand, churning out incredible delicious smells.  Yeah, I paid $3.50 for a carnitas soft taco that would be $2 elsewhere, but I will remember this one as long as I live.  I lived for years in San Antonio and Austin and I've had a lot of Mexican food, but this was one of the three best tacos I'd eaten in my whole life.  And right now I can't remember the other two!  Kelly Walsh (I think she is the owner; her card was on the table) was friendly and gracious.  A welcome relief from the attitude you get some places.   She knows that if she serves delicious food and is friendly, people will come back again and again.  I can't wait to try the Marina restaurant.", "author": "Lira K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-08", "description": "The stars on Yelp really do mean something, people, and \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is about right.  I've eaten here twice because I really wanted to give it a chance.  The first experience with the food was about the same as the second.  Both times I walked in hoping to like it, and both times I walked out vowing never to try it again.  Tacolicious definitely caters to the drunk Marina crowd and it's probably the reason it does so well.  I've tried all 6 of their tacos--the summer squash, the chicken petaluma, chorizo + potato, beef short ribs, carnitas, and fried cod.  First of all, everything is overly salty--especially chorizo + potato taco--we could not bring ourselves to finish it.  The chicken petaluma and the carnitas tacos were the best, although somewhat dry.  The fish taco is kind of gross and bland and the beef short rib tacos were just gross.  My bf and I are pretty good at finishing our plates, but we left three tacos (out of 8) half uneaten.  The best thing about this restaurant is the free chips and salsa (which was pretty tasty), but if your restaurant 's name is a combination of \"Taco\" and \"delicious\", you can't fail with the tacos!  I understand the concept of the \"modern\" taco and even an \"inventive\" taco, but I would have been wiling to pay $3.50 for a GOOD taco.  Will not be back.", "author": "Trinh N."}
