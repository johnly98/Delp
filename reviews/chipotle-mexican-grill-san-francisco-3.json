This review is more for me so as to remind myself as to why it is that I am done with Chipotle.\n\nToday, after doing a little shopping at Westfield, when returning to my office I got off the bus in front of Chipotle and thought for about 1 hot second of running in to order food then I decided to go to Rico Mex in the alley on Stevenson behind Chipotle.  \n\nTo my dismay, I found out that my favorite Mexican lunch spot \"Rico Mex,\" my go to place, is no more (they lost their lease (thanks GREEDY F-in San Francisco property owners)).  8^(\nAs such, I thought about my options and went to Caramba on 2nd Street and to my dismay they were closed for the holiday (hopefully).  I then made a stage right and went to Uno Mas.  \n\nUpon entering Uno Mas I notice a few people in front of me, I waited about 5 minutes forever, then exhausted from listening to the two babbling ladies in front of me who couldn't make up their minds, I made a stage exit left.  Okay, now where? Chipotle I guess it is.\n\nEntering Chipotle I notice three guys in front of me, no biggy, there are several employees behind the counter, certainly one of them will pay attention and notice the small line forming and  will start processing the order of the next customer.  I waited.  Finally in what took like it was forever (I think the other two guys in front of me were thinking the same and likely had the same look on their face) an employee looked at us and placed on the gloves and starting taking orders.  The guy in front of me ordered exactly what I wanted and I took notice of the heaping spoonful of chicken placed over rice along with the heaping spoonful of pico de gallo the employee slapped into the bowl and thought to myself \"Cool, I'm definitely ordering the chicken bowl.\"  \n\nThis employee is now waiting on me and I asked for the same as the person in front of me and what did I get, heaping spoonful of rice, \u00bc spoonful of scraps of chicken scrapped from the bottom of the tin bucket, \u00bc spoonful of pico de gallo and very little lettuce.  I stopped the first employee and said \"is that all the chicken you have?\"  \n\nBecause not everyone is a mind reader, what I really meant was, and should have asked \"Do you have freshly cooked chicken?  I don't want the cold meat your scrapping from what is left in the bottom of the bucket.\" But - I didn't ask this exact question and instead of getting the real answer I wanted, instead I got, \"yeah, we have more but you have to pay extra for it.  It's $2.50 extra.\"  ????wha????\n\nI had a questionable look on my face because in my head I was thinking of telling her to forget it and walk out.  But I couldn't, I was out of lunch options and had to get back to work.  \n\nI thought of the warm chicken and agreed to the extra $2.50 charge (though mind you, the guy in front of me got a heaping spoonful of chicken at the regular price; albeit cold chicken).  The two employees behind the counter helping me with my order acted as if my order was of great inconvenience to them when I asked for more pico de gallo and lettuce in the bowl.  \n\nReally????  I'm here to purchase a HOT lunch item and instead get cold scraps from the bottom of the tin bucket and a bad attitude to boot when I ask for what I want.  Really???? What part of I'm here to PURCHASE a HOT lunch item is of contention.\n\nWhen going to pay, the two employees made sure to yell out that I ordered extra chicken and it was a $2.50 extra charge.  At that point, I made my complaint to the young lady at the register - and told her this has happened to me before in the past.  This complaint was met with, \"Okay, we will make a note of it and remind us next time you're in.\"  Ahhh, me thinks NOT!!!  \n\nThis is the third and final time for Chipotle.

The quality is always very good - what you'd expect from Chipotle. Since this place is ground zero of the financial district of SF, the lines are oftentimes extremely long. Nevertheless, this location gets customer in and out in record time.\n\nFor example, a Chipotle at a different location that has 18 customers in line could easily take 15 to 25 minutes to get them in and out. This location would get those 18 customers in and out in about 6 to 9 minutes. How do they do it?

I can't really think of a reason to take away a star, especially after they removed all artificial preservatives from their food.

Another year of eating, dieting, and yelp-eliteing has begun! For my first review of the new year I pick...... 525 Market St. Chipotle!  Why? Because burritos are love http://www.yelp.com/list/burritos-are-love-san-francisco and Chipotle is my favorite guilty pleasure spot!\n\nNow you might be thinking, \"Dieting + Chipotle= burrito bowl or salad bowl.\"  WRONG!  Because burrito/salad bowls are so NOT love.\n \nWhen you make a Chipotle burrito the Susan Sparkles way, burritos are love AND diet friendly!\n\nThe Susan Sparkles Chipotle Burrito:\n\n-Tortilla: Because it's not a burrito without a tortilla. \n-Brown Rice: Yes, this location has brown rice! It is so tasty, healthy, and adds a little extra bite to the burrito.  \n-Grilled Chicken: While having a few more calories than the beef options, this limits the saturated fat but you still get meat!\n-Black beans: Everyone knows black beans have all kinds of healthy vitamins antioxidants.  Also more fiber and less salt than Chipotle's pinto beans.\n-Mild Tomato Salsa AND Medium Salsa: This is the secret to extra flavor without the extra calories, these two salsas are the lowest in calorie at 35 calories for both!)\n-Romaine Lettuce: Gives you that extra crunch and freshness.  It also beefs up your burrito so that you are more full for only 5 calories!\n\nTotal Calories of the whole Susan Sparkle Burrito: About 820cals\n\nNow you might be thinking that 820 is a ton of calories.  Well Sparkles diet tip #1 is divide and conquer.  Split that massive hunk of burrito in half!  You also get two meals for the price of one! More burrito meals is love!\n\nHere is how to ACTUALLY eat half the burrito:\n\n1) Ask for an extra burrito foil and to go bag when you check out.\n2) Lay some napkins down on any Chipotle surface to act as a cutting board/germ barrier.\n3) Place your foil wrapped burrito on the napkin (Note: Whatever you do, don't remove the foil!)\n4) Use the surprisingly sturdy Chipotle plastic knife to slice the foil covered burrito in half.\n5) Wrap one half in extra foil and put it in the to go bag and roll up the bag to securely close it.\n6) Nom the other half slowly so you get full faster.  Drink lots of water because it slows you down and there is a lot of sodium in burritos.\n7) Feel REALLY guilty if you go through the trouble of unrolling the to go bag and take off two layers of foil to nom the other half.\n\nTotal Calories in half the Susan Sparkles Burrito: 410cals\n\nWhile you can make a Susan Sparkles Burrito at any Chipotle, I like this one due to its location near my office (walking is healthy!), fast service (fidi line looks scary during lunch hour but the line moves surprisingly fast), and cleanliness despite the high volume.\n\nHappy New Year Fellow Yelpers!", "author": "Susan C."}

Anytime before 2pm is generally busy, but if you download the Chipotle app, you can preorder, thereby bypassing the line and moving straight to the register for pickup.\n\nThis location is frequented by businesspeople who often can't be bothered to say \"please\", \"thank you\", or exchange any sort of pleasantries with the person making their food. When greeted with a \"Hi, how are you today?\", the poor serviceperson is assailed with a machine-gunned litany of demands.\n\nAside from the fact that your Mom taught you better than that and it takes maybe two seconds to respond to the question and perhaps even ask how they're doing, you will often find that just by being nice, you will get a more generous scoop of whatever protein you select! \n\nHere are a couple of other hints for Chipotle: Quesadillas are not just for kids - they have a press to make them if you want one. You can also ask for extra tortillas on the side, ask for a side of the salad vinaigrette (they are pretty good in burrito bowls), or my favorite, ask for hard taco shells. Crunch them up and put them in your burrito bowl for texture, or to make a taco salad.\n\nThe service here is on point and super friendly, the food is fresh, relatively healthy, and it's delicious and inexpensive. Plus, if you're all about that liquid lunch (and you know who you are!) this Chipotle makes margaritas with Sauza for 4 and change, or for just over seven dollars, Patron, and there's no bartender to tip.

The food is delicious and wholesome.  It really fills you up. I chose to eat here again, at the 525 Market location, in San Francisco.  It was that good.\n\nI love how they have a \"subway\" style build your own burrito hot bar, right in front of you. The ingredients are right in front of your eyes, and look absolutely delectable.  The service is super fast!  Excellent.\n\nI'd normally give it 4 stars, but have to drop 1 star for below comments.  Sorry.\n\nI do have some complaints.  I notice that the premium Mexican \"fresh mex\" type restaurants, all have high premium prices, compared to places like Taco Bell, etc.  Obviously, the food is 10 times better.  I also notice they normally have a full sized salsa bar at most of these places, (La Salsa, Baja Fresh, etc.) and they give you quite a section as part of your purchase.\n\nChipolte, inexplicably, charges for salsa, chips and Guacamole.  I'm confused by this. I can sort of understand the charge for Guacamole, tasting it is out of this world, and it is made fresh, not canned or bottled, to the best of my taste buds ability; but charging for salsa chips and salsa, seems to outlandish.  For the record, the charge for a bag chips and guacamole is $2.40 at this location (525 Market Street) and I believe it was $1.90 for salsa  and chips.  I didn't see a separate price for chips alone, and wonder if it's not available or the same price for chips and salsa together.  They definitely didn't do the normal chips included with a burrito option, and I paid for all chips and condiments I received.  My total purchase price for a delicious chicken burrito and chips and guacamole was around $9.50.  \n\nI would normally not complain out loud on a review board, but it just happened to be that somebody complained behind me for the charge for Guacamole, I think $2.40, which he had included on his burrito.  So no lesser charge if you include Guacamole on your burrito or tacos.  Seems a trifle high.  He comments out loud to the clerk.  I should also add, that when I requested Guacamole, at the restaurant in Alameda, the table clerk told me up front, that the charge was an additional $1.90 (the price for chips and guac was a slightly lower $1.90 at the restaurant in Alameda, but $2.40 in the one in San Francisco).  I very quickly declined since I planned to buy a separate Guacamole and chips for $1.90.\n\nOther than that, I thought it was awesome!

When it comes to taste, Mexican \"food chains\" fall short every time - Chipotle is decent, but there are just too many other authentically delicious options in San Francisco, in my opinion. The only exception to that would be if you're looking for healthier alternatives to taqueria food. Chipotle's burritos are also fresher and ligher, and while I personally don't prefer that, I think it's great to have healthier options out there for those who want it.\n\nI've had their carne asada tacos and their burritos here. I didn't have high expectations, and they were are as good as I imagined - which is just okay.

The fast food industry, for better or worse, aspires to consistency.  You get the same tasting food at Chipotle, wherever you go in this country.\n\nOn this day, however, as we all dug into our burritos, all conversation stopped.  Something was different.  All four of us were having the greatest Chipotle experience of our lives.  I can't explain how any single Chipotle burrito (or in this case four) is better than any other Chipotle burrito.  It just was.  No matter how the chain may strive for uniformity, there are always going to be elements left to chance.  Perhaps the doneness of the meat, perhaps the seasoning of the salsa.  I don't know.  But on that glorious afternoon, all of the dominoes in the universe had fallen into place for us to enjoy the greatest four burritos that had ever been made in Chipotle history.\n\nI've returned to this same location many times since.  We all have.  It's not the same.  That perfect moment will never be recreated again.  And I'm okay with that.  Someday, though, years from now, I will sit my grandchild upon my knee, and tell them of that perfect day in 2008, when grandpa was still young, the robots still served the humans, and the four of us had the most awesome Chipotle burrito experience of all time.

I only have two questions for Mr. Ronald McDonald: Why wouldn't McDonald's restaurants serve healthy food and why aren't McDonald's restaurants as efficient as Chipotle?\n\nWhen you walk into Chipotle, you see the faux wood and aluminum decor which screams \"cheap.\"  \"Cheapotle,\" if you will.  Yes, that WAS bad.  \n\nIt is a fast food place, though, so what do you expect?  Then you notice an battalion of people behind the counter, each person armed and dangerous (their weapons range from ladle to aluminum foil).  Fast, easy, efficient.\n\nHere's where Chipotle gets tricky: before you step up to the counter, you'd better be damn sure you know EXACTLY what you want.  Don't think and don't blink, just answer questions.  \"Bowl.\"  \"White Rice.\"  \"Chicken.\"  \"Red Salsa\"  \"No cheese.\"  \"Guacamole.\"  You pay, you're done.\n\nI had a burrito bowl, which tasted pretty good.  The chicken was tender, although the white rice was slightly overcooked.  Guacamole was very tasty, although the lettuce was lacking in freshness.  I do like the idea of burrito in a bowl, however: you eat it with a fork, and it feels like you're having a real meal.\n\nI would have liked to have known ahead of time that guacamole was extra $1.10.  It's not about the extra $1; it's about the sticker shock.  I bet it's posted somewhere, but who can read that fast?  You've got to move quickly, lest the Chipotle conveyor belt hurts you.\n\nThis place is also relatively small, so prepare to fight for your right to sit at the table.

However, I'm still going to admit that I love Chipotle. It's never let me down, and has always satisfied my cravings for a burrito, taco, or taco salad. YUM!! The prices are average, the burrito makers are friendly, it's always clean inside and welcoming. I especially love their veggie fajita burrito w/ black beans medium salsa and everything on it. They serve you up a whole lot for your money, which is nice and fattening all in one! But hey, once in awhile it's okay right?? They also give you free sides of salsa, which seems rare these days with the hole in the wall places.  When I was in college living in Santa Barbara, they would always throw in a complementary drink b/c I was a student! Now, I don't drink soft drinks so it's not a big deal that I'm old. But yea, I do love this place because it's good every time!", "author": "Sonya D."}

I know you can go to the mission and get a burrito that maybe is a little bit better and maybe a buck cheaper. But for basically being a fast food mexican restaurant I don't get how you can bad mouth this place.\n\nThey use good fresh ingredients. The place is clean (which you can't say about most of those mission places). And it's worlds above taco bell.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about Chipotle is the locations of the only two in San Francisco. I mean really do you need to put two of them within two blocks of each other? I mean it almost would have been better if they had just put the new one inside the Westfield mall...although that's a bit of a stretch.

Today, on MLK day, there was no line and I thought it was my lucky day. \n\nI ordered a Vegetarian Burrito, which is basically a non-vegetarian burrito without the meat. All the food was thrown onto the burrito - one of the women splattered guac all over her arm doing that. I had barely time to stuff my money in my wallet at the cash register because all they wanted was that I leave. When I ate the burrito, I had to use fork and knife to avoid it from falling apart while eating. And then it turns out the whole thing was cold! Not only the stuff that's supposed to be cold, also the rice and the beans. And everything was tasteless - not mild, as I wanted it. \n\nBottom line: If you want a lot of food for your money and you don't care what it tastes like, this is the place for you.

I'm usually of the mindset, if it's a hole-in-the-wall and you have to tip-toe through a back alleyway to get there, lead the way!  This establishment is anything but.  I usually frequent this place when I'm in a pinch and I don't feel like schlepping myself all over the FiDi to find something to eat.  \n\nENVIRONMENT:  Situated right off of Market Street, it's in the crosshairs of all the FiDi-ites and tourists on any given day.  Like all Mc-Johnny-come-lately (ironically, McDonald's owned a majority stake in Chipotle up until 2006) establishments, the decor and footprint are very similar to all of its other outlets, clean lines, industrial and metal.\n\nSERVICE:  Assembly-line-like process.  After deciding what you want, you go down the line of burrito-engineers (or salad-engineers, if that's more your thing), requesting the various fresh ingredients laid out before you.  Warning, you'd better know what you want before you get to the beginning of the assembly-line, otherwise you'll be able to feel two dozen pairs of eyes searing into the back of your head.\n\nFOOD:  I'm a creature of habit, so I tend to get the same thing.  I usually get the Fajita Burrito (instead of beans, you get sauteed veggies (red & green bell peppers and onions)) with Steak, Sour Cream, Cheese and their delicious Roasted Chili-Corn (I'm thoroughly convinced it's laced with crack, which is the reason why I keep coming back...not really, but kinda funny come to think of it).\n\nI'm not too wild about their spicy salsa.  It's a little too 'limey' for my taste.  Their chips aren't bad, but they could stand to back down on the salt just a tad.\n\nOVERALL:  If I'm in a pinch and want a consistent McBurrito, this is your place.  As a warning, don't go between 12 p.m. - 1 p.m. during the week.  The line gets ridiculously long (out the door twelve people deep) and you'd wind-up being one more person I'd have to stand behind :-)", "author": "Bao T."}

My favorites are the veggie bowl, their chips, and guacamole. Not only is the food great, but so are the employees.  They are all very nice, always smiling....and very efficient!  Usually the line wraps around outside and around the corner during the lunch hour, but it does seem to move fairly fast.  They have a cute little patio which is perfect for enjoying a nice cold beer and burrito on nice sunny days.\n\nIn addition to all of this, I have to commend them on their honesty and sincerity.  I had gone in one day and happened to drop my wallet in there.  At the time, I was under a lot of stress and didn't even realize that I had left it behind, until the next morning when I received a call from the manager.  He had found it on the floor and was able to get ahold of me through a 3rd party (business card)...  everything was in tact & he refused to take a reward.  \n\nAll in all, I'll always be back to this place, and to this location in particular!", "author": "Rhiannon A."}

I ended up with hot salsa instead the mild I shouted out when asked.  There was a tomato stem in my taco.  The really cool manager who was nice and kept everybody moving but without flinging food and sloppy preparation has moved on, and the restaurant was not as good.

This all changed, of course, when I actually visited the location a couple weeks ago.  When I placed my order, I asked what kinds of tortillas were available, and I was ignored by that employee.  (In all fairness, I think Chipotle offers only flour tortillas, but that is no excuse for not answering my question.)  Then, while an employee was preparing my order, I asked if they had queso, and again, my question was ignored completely, and they went on to the next customer.  (I was unsure if Chipotle had queso, as this was one of my first experiences in a Chipotle.)  Then I asked for hot sauce, and instead an employee pulled the tub of hot sauce, which was at least 70% full, and ran off with it.  I asked if I could get hot sauce, and again...no one responded.  After a minute or so, the employee returned with the tub of hot sauce...I couldn't tell you if it had been refilled or not, as I did not notice.  Then I asked for lettuce on my \nburrito.  Instead, the employee behind the counter ignored me, and wrapped up the burrito.  Finally, the manager at the front of the line seemed to be telling people which cashier to go to.  He told me, and I asked him for chips and salsa.  He then turned away to have a discussion with two or three employees, while still holding my food.  After asking (politely) several times...I turned and walked out.\n\nI sent an email off to Chipotle about the experience.  Two managers wrote back.  They apologized in emails where literally EVERY SENTENCE had at least one spelling or grammatical error.

I ordered the steak salad. When I opened it up it looked like a bowl of shredded lettuce and cheese, but after digging into it and taking a bite, I was pleasantly surprised. They gave me a big portion of steak, cut up into bite size pieces, which was very flavorful and had a nice juice on it (I dunno if this was the salsa or the steak marinade/sauce). It was kind of salty but that is exactly what I like. I was surprised how good the beef tasted as usually I don't expect steak at a fast food place, or even at a Chevy's or other low-medium priced restaurant to taste very good.  At Chipotle the spicy mixture of meat and sauce was offset quite nicely by cool dollops of sour cream and simple, but delicious shredded chese. The lettuce, I admit, was unimpressive as it was like half a cup of shredded iceberg, but it actually worked out really well, making the meat the star of the dish.  The crisp and fresh lettuce (shreds) cooled my tongue in between bites of my delicious mix of meat, sour cream, and salsa. Beware, the Hot Salsa is really HOT! But it's really yummy so I would order it on the side, then add to  your liking.\n\nAfter I finished off the dish, I shamelessly (ok I was in my office alone, with the door closed) licked the to-go box to get an remnants of that delicious meat juice and sour cream mixture. \n\nIt's not a date spot, or anywhere I'd go for dinner, but I would definitely go back for lunch during the week as it's quick and cheap (only $6 for my salad and I was pretty full afterwards)!", "author": "amy k."}

If you have ever been in for a Financial District lunch rush and can honestly say you have never had your stress level rise, please let me know your secret.  Everytime I give this place another shot they only confirm and reconfirm my originally feelings that this place sucks.  First of all whenever I go I always have to order more then one item (usually a smart observant co-worker who wants to reap the benefit of my pain staking quest) which usually means total and utter confusion for the guy taking orders.  Then the assembly line cranks the basic meat on torilla out so fast that your order is six people ahead of you being attacked by other orders like bumber cars awaiting your salsa choice. Once somewhat in front of your order (now keep in mind if you have two items like I do you are screwed; the second one just leave it behind - there is no chance, it is already soaked in whatever the guy behind you wanted on his) you have to yell NO to the lady as she assumes you want the tomato-onion salsa over the more \"authentic\" hot salsa, then if you want anything else start yelling cause your burrito is closing near to the wrapping station.  Once at the register a slight sigh of relief as you are alomst done and then before you can say chips and guacamole you are pushed to the side and the register guy is looking to the next person behind you.....sorry game over better luck next time!   I would like to at least say the food is yummy, but I've never walked out of there with exactly what I wanted.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

The line is long, but moves fast... at a cost to quality! If you're ordering To-Go, make sure everything is securely closed since they are often very sloppy. During lunch hour, one time my burrito bowl completely fell apart in my bag and another time they put about half was much as usual, leaving me very hungry afterwards, which never happens when they take their time.\n\nIt's so sad. Quantity of customers over quality of service. But still good food.", "author": "J P."}

I wanted a taco - i.e. ONE taco - for lunch.  Not possible -  you get three for $6.50, period.   If you want a corn tortilla, they only have crispy, not soft.  There goes authentic.  The person taking my order asked me at least 4 times what kind of meat I wanted.  I said steak, she replied Chicken?  I said steak in Spanish, and after I asked what was on the taco, she again asked if I wanted chicken.  Twice.  The assembly line after her spooned little cubes of \"steak\" in sauce - I couldn't swear it wasn't chunks of dogfood because the sauce obscured any flavor - onto 3 little flour tortillas, then pointed at the salsa and the sour cream with the spoon and a raised eyebrow. I said \"everything,\" which was not the best answer because for 1 Tbsp of guacamole, $1.65 got added to my bill.  Beans, chips & salsa - extra $,  pass. Then they stuffed all three \"tacos\" into a *tiny* basket and threw shredded lettuce over the top.  Total w/ tax: nearly $9.  At the table, I could not manage to pick up even one of these slippery overloaded monstrosities - ended up eating the whole thing with a fork.  Left half of it in the basket, too.\n\nIf your idea of Mexican food is an expensive gut-bomb with no concern for presentation or culture, you may enjoy Chipotle Grill.  Everybody else,  get a real taco from one of San Francisco's real Mexican food places, or at least go to Baja Fresh, only a block away.", "author": "Diana R."}

Yes. And I like that, because I would rather watch them make my food then duck out behind a wall or corner and then bring it to me. And hello... this particular location has some of the best cheap margaritas I have ever had! Less than $4.00 each! And no, it's not a margarita with wine, they use the real stuff. Only issue I have is sometimes I have seen them get skimpy with things such as rice, or they will only put one spoonful of meat, things like that. And I always have to ask for lettuce, which seems crazy but whatever.

Little compares to the angst engendered during the walk back to my office, wondering whether the right guy made the carnitas this morning.  Little, that is, but the grave disappointment of finding out upon diving in that, in fact, the *other* guy made the carnitas, and rather than a crunchy, juicy mouthful of porcine satisfaction, I'm faced with stewed pig in a wrap.\n\nIt's with this backdrop in mind that I visited Chipotle.  Corporate-bashing foodies rejoice:  it's not a trip I'll make again.  \n\nMy burrito was worth eating only in the context of earnest research.  Carnitas were OK, though significantly underrepresented in the population of other ingredients.  Rice and beans were tasteless and made up the bulk of the mass.  This portion proportion is hardly unusual, but the combined effect was so bland that it magnified the unhappy situation.  Corn mixture was cold enough to impact the temperature of the total product, and the \"hot\" salsa wouldn't even register on the Scoville scale.\n\nSo to those of you tired of bouncing from one grimy, underperforming \"local\" place to the next in search of a consistently good lunchtime burrito, I say:  keep on bouncing.
