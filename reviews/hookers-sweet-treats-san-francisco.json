No, these aren't just any hooker's sweet treats you'll sample here. These are artisanal salted caramels that were clearly made with love and you'll sit at the communal table (found in every up-and-coming restaurant in San Francisco) and savor every single bite. \n\nEnjoy it while it lasts, because you'll only get two or three bites out of every caramel, which makes it hard for me to justify the price of these caramels. The flavor combination found in the dark chocolate, small pieces of pretzel, and rice cereal in the Party Girl Caramel was admittedly quite tasty, but none of the salted caramels really wowed me. This place reminds me of the pricey creative cookies you can find at Milk Bar in D.C. or New York that are unfortunately never really worth it.

It took a friend to tell me about this place and once he told me the name of the little joint I LOL'd! (Laughed out loud).\nYes, the name names me chuckle but the chocolate has me coming back for more!\n\nDID YOU KNOW: That this store was on the cooking channel \"Unique Sweets\" and trust me when I say, the owner David, does make unique sweet treats.\n\nYup, you heard me right, David the owner is the one that makes these sweet treats sweet....Okay so that may be cheesy but you get the drift! The store has been around for 6 years! Wowzers! I would have never known since I have never heard of this little gem before.\n\nThey offer a handful of flavor combos but the base on them all is a salty buttery caramel that is both creamy, chewy and doesn't stick to your teeth. Seriously, how often do you find that? They have about6 or 7 flavor choices that all run $2 a pop and considering the size and handmade-ness of them all, it's pretty worth it. \n\nI was so impressed with the work that David does that I had to order the $20 box of 10 pieces of chocolates. 6 or 7 of those are specialty flavors and 4 are the original flavors.\n\nHonestly I love all of them! They all have unique flavors and special names and I admit they are unique names as well such as:\n\n-Party Girl Caramel-The sassy and spicy chocolate \n-Straight Boyfriend Caramel-The curious chocolate who really wants a little TLC. This chocolate consists of 3 types of chocolate, peanut butter cookie base, & candied peanuts. Yum\n-The Towne S/more Caramel-Who has been around the block awhile! HAHA\n\nOKAY...so you get the picture right? Very unique names they are!\n\nThere specialty includes: handmade salted caramels\n\nThe sweet that started it all: the OG, a buttery caramel encased in organic, fair-trade dark chocolate and dusted with smoked sea salt\n\nMy Recommendation of them all: the 3rd Nut caramel, an OG chock-full of almonds, cashews, and pecans\n\nOther sweets that they sale in the store: strawberry-chocolate-chip bread pudding and caramel pralines, which 7x7 deemed one of the city's best cookies\n\nLocal retailers that sale Hooker's products: Sightglass Coffee, Rare Device, and Bi-Rite Market\n\nBIG thanks to Daniel who was the cashier in the front and helped me with my order.\n\nBIG SHOUT-OUT to David for making this delicious tasteful chocolates that will definitely keep me coming back for more!\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this to all my friends especially the ones that are new to town. This is such a hidden gem that sales the BEST DANG CARAMEL CHOCOLATES. They make perfect gifts for birthdays, anniversaries or just to treat yourself.\n\nTrust me you will have NO regrets!\n\nREVIEW 63/196", "author": "Porsche C."}

Along with Brenda's, it is one of the few reasons that make it completely worth the trek through this shady, homeless infested neighborhood.\n\nI don't know where to begin with how great this place is. Let's start with the most important part, the sweets.\n\nWe ate like it was our last meal ever, and not just the last day of our vacation, and ordered almost the entire menu. It was all well worth the accompanying sugar shakes:\n\n- Banana-Salted Caramel Bread Pudding ($5):\nThis is one of the greatest things I've ever eaten...ever. It is a very generously sized piece of sticky bread, dripping in salted caramel and bourbon sauces, and covered in delicious pecans, all served HOT. There is really no better taste possible.\n\n- Praline Caramel Bar ($3):\nThis bar was amazing. It was extremely moist and each bite had a delicious combination of chocolate and pecans in addition to the great taste of the praline base.\n\n- Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie: ($2):\nI know I say this too often, but this was really one of my favorite peanut butter cookies ever. The cookie itself had a really deep peanut buttery flavor, which went extremely well with the chocolate chips studded throughout. There were also whole peanuts baked into the cookie which added a nice salty crunch to the cookie.\n\n- Salted Caramel ($2):\nAnd finally, we also tried one of the salted caramels, which is what they are most known for. Keeping with the nut theme, instead of getting the original flavor, we tried the \"Third Nut\" caramel. This was very delicious as well and the chocolate combined with the many different nuts was a great taste once again. I wish I fully checked my shame at the door and ordered at least one of each of the other two types of caramels as well since they sound great (the original, with sea salt on top, and the espresso chocolate, with pistachios on top).\n\n- French Press Sightglass Coffee ($4):\nTo go with all of our sweets we also got some amazing coffee. I normally need at least some sweetener or milk on my coffee, but this was so good I didn't need to add anything. The flavor was so rich and it was nice and strong without being too bitter.\n\nTo add to the enjoyment of our sugar feast, the place itself has a very nice atmosphere. It feels like an old timey candy shoppe from the old west. In addition, the staff is super friendly and very helpful and nice to talk to. They engaged us in conversation, which was actually very pleasant, as opposed to some places where it can get pretty intrusive and makes you wish they would just leave you alone.\n\nThe friendliness of the staff just made the whole experience that much better. They also offer nice boxes of caramels to go. We loved it so much we bought a gift box of 10 caramels to go for $20.\n\nDo not be deterred by the neighborhood and make sure you stop by Hooker's, you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Mike C."}

I've been wanting to come here for awhile, but every time I stopped by it was closed. I finally gone after I went to Turtle Tower. Okay, so it cost about the same as my bowl of pho at Turtle Tower, but the dark chocolate salted caramel banana bread pudding is that good! I got one, to-go, but right when she gave it to me in the little box, I felt it was warm. Hot even. I had to open it right away to take a bite! It already looked so pretty I didn't want to disturb it. I never thought bread pudding can have so much sauce to it. Warm, creamy, delicious caramel sauce! It keeps the bread from being too dry, but surprisingly the bread doesn't absorb it all and make it too sweet. She even added pecans over it. I don't even like pecans, but now I have an exception!\n\nThe bread pudding itself is very cake-like soft, but not too soft. It's chewy, and there might be a hint of rum possibly (?) cause it has that very small rum flavor that tastes great with bread pudding. There's also some hints of dark chocolate, but it's not very heavy. If anything, it added a bit of bitterness to the pudding, but it balanced the caramel very well. Surprisingly, after you eat it, although it looks really heavy, doesn't feel very heavy. Like you don't need water right away because it's so overwhelmingly sweet. Very impressed. It's $6, but if you like sweets and cake and salted caramel, then it's almost a steal. Either way, I can't get enough of it and now I keep thinking about it!!!", "author": "Jessica C."}

Very delicious. I love that the caramels are soft to chew! Buttery, sweet, goodness. $2.50, I think. I don't remember.\n\nThe bread pudding was as delicious as I remember if not better.

In love with their caramels, the coffee and their maple pecan scone. \n\nAfter training for two hours most mornings, when I am done I am dying for some great coffee and light morning snacks. I have turned this into kind of a mission, attempting to try a new local (screew Starbucks and Peet's) coffee place every day I train. The problem is, now that I have discovered Hooker's it is much harder to justify going someplace else. \n\nThe first time went there, I got in just as they opened and you could smell the warm scones fresh out of the oven. The sweet smell of baked bread and maple permeated the air - I was in heaven. The small venue allowed me to unwind after a hard workout, sipping my coffee and mentally getting ready for the day. \n\nSince I am also a huge fan of caramel, I had to get a few for later that day, but I wasn't expecting much. I have gotten used to caramel just not being that good, since I grew up with my dad making caramel, perfecting his recipe over the years, such that I now don't care for any place that can't make an equally good product. To my surprise, Hooker's is as good as my father's, lovingly crafted caramel. Mind blow.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go here on your next morning coffee break and start your day off right. Also pick up some caramels for later, you won't regret it.", "author": "scott h."}

Small in size and surprisingly hip in feel despite the Tenderloin locale a visit to Hooker's will likely entail a short walk amidst some of the area's most unfortunate yet once inside the cozy confines a more pleasant scene unfolds with wood and hues of blue strewn in NOLA-themed d\u00e9cor while notes of vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar permeate the air.  By all definitions an artisan operation with Williams working both counter and kitchen it was with friendly smiles that questions were answered and taking a seat at the windowside bar it would not be long before my order arrived, the caramel still bubbling as it dripped down the side of a golden mini-loaf into a fancy shallow bowl.  Generally preferring this style of pudding to more free-form versions served via slice or scoop the beauty of Hooker's Big Easy begins in the bread - a golden eggy thing with soft custard beneath crunchy top - and spruced up with raisins along with candied pecans for taste plus texture the dish is brought to new heights in the salty buttered caramel, a flavor surprisingly not too sweet but instead 'just right' in allowing cinnamon notes to shine for an almost savory finish...a flavor I'd later find equally present in all three takeaways, the smoky complexity of the cashew bar particularly satisfying when paired with coffee as I awaited yet another delayed plane.", "author": "Michael U."}

Luckily, Hooker's Sweet Treats is so popular that it was the first result.  Hooker's Sweet Treats is located in the Tenderloin area, and it's a hidden gem.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I planned to visit Hooker's after seeing it on a list of the 10 best bread puddings in S.F.  \nhttp://www.refinery29.com/best-bread-pudding-san-francisco/slideshow#slide-2\nWe visited on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. and were warmly greeted by two men working.  They were very friendly and helpful in explaining the products that they offer and they made us feel at home.  We ordered the bread pudding, which happened to be banana-chocolate bread pudding that day (the guy said that it changes every few days).\n\nThe bread pudding ($5) is pre-made, but warmed up in the oven when ordered.  At the time of ordering, they also prepare the delicious caramel sauce.  It took about 5 minutes for the bread pudding to be brought to our table and it was well-worth the wait.  In the meantime, one of the guys brought us a bottle of water and two mason jars as well.  When the bread pudding arrived at our table, I'm sure both of our eyes lit up.  It was a fair-sized piece of bread pudding topped with pecans and drizzled/surrounded with a delicious, flavorful caramel sauce.  The bread pudding had a nice slight crispiness to some of the edges and was very moist on the inside.  The center of the bread pudding is filled with chocolate and a piece of caramel- a pleasant surprise that I wasn't expecting.  Overall, it was delicious.  If you like caramel, you will love this dish.\n\nThe bread pudding was plenty for my boyfriend and I to share- but another woman ordered one for herself- so it can be done.  The shop is not too big, but there was plenty of seating because it wasn't really too busy that afternoon.  It's cutely decorated and I hope to come back soon to try out their caramels.\n\nNotes:\n-They serve Sightglass coffee.", "author": "Samantha L."}

We love the laid back vibe - took pics with our phones and the photos look very vintage! \n\nWe ordered a little bit of everything on the menu...chai, a latte, coffee (I feel I'd get the coffee again because it arrived in its own French press and was good for about a 3-4 cup serving...delicious dark roast too!) - for eats, of course we got a couple of the salted caramels, a peanut butter chocolate cookie, a cheddar biscuit, and the bread pudding of the day which was coconut blueberry in a sweet bourbon syrup. Everything was sinfully rich and paired wonderfully with our drinks. \n\nDefinitely coming back again and again - I love Hookers!", "author": "Elaine W."}

I was at Civic Center Bart this morning and used the yelp app on my Droid to get the address and cross streets for Hooker's Sweet Treats in the TL. After finding out it was 0.4 miles away I paused wondering if it was worth the walk the way I was feeling. Well I had Madison with me and she needed her morning walk so I figured what the heck, it's at least down hill on the return trip. \n\n@10 minutes later I arrived in front of Hooker's. The only thing out front that differentiates it from any of the other poorly maintained buildings was the clean wooden bench for customers to sit on. In other words you'll want to know the address before you attempt locating it.\n\nThere was a cute young hipster couple in front of me who ordered french press coffee and carmels, other than that I was lucky to have the place to myself while I tried to choose between the offerecd sweets. I finally decided on a mocha (with soy of course my LA friends) and a sea salted carmel square. Because I love sight glass coffee I already knew the mocha would be perfect, not too sweet, but sweet enough you don't need to add anything to it. An impressive job of steaming the milk to the perfect temp, stopping just before it would scald your tongue but still having enough heat you know it won't be cold the last few sips.\n\nThe carmel was heavenly. About a perfect square inch and a half inch thick it was dipped in chocolate and sprinkled in sea salt. It was the most delicious carmel I 've had in SF, even the texture was perfect. And the way it complimented my mocha.. ahhhh!! I reccomend that you buy two because one is absolutely not enough. At $2 each that may seem expensive but it is worth every penny. I had to walk a block back because I made the mistake of only buying one! Bring $10 with you and I promise you heaven and perfect satisfaction. The barrista will be happy as well because that leaves him $1.50 change for a tip!", "author": "Lisa H."}

You, dear reviewer, were already there and waiting for your bread pudding.  A few minutes later a gentleman walked in and up to the counter to order, to which the owner told him there was another customer before him (I believe he was referring to both of us actually).  He explained the coffee was made to order and the French press would take some time.  I took the situation as the owner just letting the man know it would be more than a minute to get his coffee, as he looked in a hurry.  The man obviously was and left.\n\nAs for regulars laughing, you are again mistaken.  The owner commented to us that good coffee takes time after the man left.  There was no laughter.  The comment wasn't a joke.   We agreed.  Noticing a man doesn't have time to wait isn't a comment on him, but mere fact.  There are mornings when I am in a hurry and do not have time to wait.  I would appreciate a business owner warning me of a wait.  It means he is paying attention to the fact that I am rushed.  \n\nGlad that's cleared up.

The website mentions that online ordering will start in the 2009 fall season via email (info@hookerssweettreats.com).\n\n** Update: Originally the treats were sold thru Sightglass Coffee on 7th Street @Folsom (daytime), and The Perish Trust on Divisadero. The cafe opened in June 2010 (gritty neighborhood, near 38 Muni bus stop), serving Sightglass brand coffee drinks ($2.50-$4.50) and adding many other delicious goodies - hot caramel sauce topped bread pudding ($5, seasonal flavors), cookies ($2-$3), etc. (caramels are now $2 each). And they now accept credit cards.\n\nCafe hours: Tue-Fri 8am-4pm, Sat-Sun 10am-2pm\nClosed Mondays.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Luis C."}

There's a (relatively) new addictive substance in town. I mean, Hooker's is not like a Saison or Coi. It's that sinfully delicious dirty (it's actually quite clean) darling that you can't take your mind off of. This candy destination, located in a convenient, but not very sweet part of town (which does not detract from its magnetic qualities in the least), is one of those places I cannot find any fault. It is certainly one of the TL's little purveyors of mouth pleasure. For one thing, it's cheaper than the other kind and secondly it's for sure less likely to cause infection. The pumpkin bread pudding with the baked in chocolate covered salted caramel was heavenly. The coffee is Ritual. The staff is friendly. Chocolates go one for $2, three for $7 (for the packaging) and ten for $20. I love the salted caramels, especially the ones with nuts. Honestly, who doesn't like nuts? Am I taking this whole \"hooker\" thing too far? I know, I know. Despite the colorful local \"help,\" the hooker in Hooker's Sweet Treats is actually the proprietor's nickname.  \n\nAnyway, let's talk more about the important things, like this bread pudding. Sultry caramel wraps its arms around a dense, moist and not overly sweet pumpkin bread pudding. The bread pudding cradles a secret heart of oozing chocolate and caramel.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-29", "description": "When life gives me lemons, I get Hooker's. Here's my short list: dark chocolate-covered caramels flecked with sea salt (yes), a nutted version with a base of dark chocolate (my preference), a spiced chai latte (!!!), sweet cheddar biscuit (more exclamation marks), and unreal peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. Cash only. Closed on Mondays. Great if you live in the neighborhood. Worth the walk in.\n\nI generally find myself crestfallen after stomaching a Monday back at the office after a weekend of blowing off steam after a week of bottling up the dark matter. So come Tuesday, when the lights at the crosswalk on Geary conspire against my preferred steady pace through the throngs of tourists, junkies, kids and conventioneers, it's with great pleasure that I walk in the opposite direction, down Hyde and into a shopfront that'd be easy to miss and one's usual, hurried pace. \n\nAnd what light. I'm not talking the luminescence of the several few scattered Edison bulbs, or the lamps in the back illuminating the baking area, nor do I speak of the raw sewage-colored light reflecting off the building facades across the street. No. This is the light of warmth. From David \"Hooker\", the friendly gent that runs the place, to the slight heat coming from the ovens in the back, the smell of baked goods and the patina on the collection of slightly nautical, if not coastal Americana inside. \n\nOf course, the salted, dark chocolate caramels are excellent. Subtle in taste and texture; just a wonderful bit to let hang around in your mouth. It tells great stories, but doesn't cause a ruckus. The other version, boasting a base of dark chocolate and family of nuts in a small Vanagon of caramel resting on top, really topped it for me. Add to that subtle wonder of the Original, and put the lovely, nutty pleasure of nuts. Crazy, baby. They have Sightglass Coffee. The spiced chai latte is both refreshing and savory, perfect for any climate, and the peanut butter chocolate chip cookies just slay. Like everything here, it's subtle: the peanut butter flavor just playing rub-a-dub footsie with the chocolate, a base of moist yet almost chewy cookie, and peanuts. \n\nMy personal favorite: the sweet cheddar biscuit has a wonderful, almost cornbread texture (when cornbread is moist and cakey), with a slight spice somewhere in there. Eating that and walking to work makes me think that the lights on O'farrel are changing just to keep my walk leisurely, despite the engineering of people with big brains, who program those lights to change at some pace that's a mystery to me. A mystery it should remain.", "author": "Roy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-05", "description": "It's been about what, 4 years since Bi-Rite Creamery popularized the combination of salt and caramel?  It's now fairly common as an upscale ice cream, in cookies and in a mash-up with another recent food trend, on cupcakes.  If I had eaten a plain old salted caramel before having one at Hooker's, it must not have been a memorable experience.\n\nBut Hooker's salted caramel is nothing short of perfection, balancing the sweet and bitter of softly pliable caramel and a delicate dark chocolate coating with the playfully light bite of a few flakes of salt.  This is a caramel you can eat without fear of losing a filling (I don't have any) or a tooth (I have plenty).  At $2 a hit, they are expensive as a confection, but affordable as a luxury product.\n\nSimilar care was taken with the $3 peanut-butterscotch cookie.  It too balanced sweet with salt, soft cookie with sticky butterscotch and crunchy peanuts.  Again, it's a bit expensive if you have a daily fix, but priced right or an occasional indulgence.\n\nHooker's also does a commendable job with the coffee, using Sightglass coffee roasted not even one mile away.\n\nFinally, Hookers makes good use of a small space.  It looks very up-to-date San Francisco meaning it is old-timey in that vintage hip sort of way, yet still feels comfortable.", "author": "Suo L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-19", "description": "There simply aren't words to describe the experience of eating the amazing sea salted dark chocolate covered caramels created by \"Hooker\", of Hooker's Sweet Treats.  You're not just eating chocolate, you are consuming a piece of heaven.  With each and every bite, your mouth is delivered a bit of rich chocolate, caramel that is the perfect taste (sweet, but not too sweet) and texture (doesn't stick all over your teeth) and the sea salt on top kicks all the flavors up a notch.  I've made myself sick on these, they're so flippin' good.\n\nIf you can get your hands on the Orange Caramels, I HIGHLY recommend trying these as well.  Again the texture is perfection and the combination of the sweet caramel infused with orange is just about the the best thing ever!!!", "author": "J B."}

I thought they just stuck to Larkin.\"\n\nMy walking companion made equally charming commentary as we passed a local middle aged resident shouting solicitations at cars between sips and slurps of her shiny goblet of King Cobra or Steel Reserve. Classy for a sunny afternoon.\n\nBut as charming as this dew of sundrops was, she didn't hold a candle to Hooker's itself. Upon entering the dark exterior opens up to a small, warm, rustic but homey interior. I don't know why but I was instantly feeling a Little House on the Prarie vibe in a great way. A large dark wood table flanks the left side of the cafe and the menu is simply displayed in the corner of both the front window and to the right of the cash register. A large chalk board to the upper left promotes the daily special. When I went there were cheese biscuits, caramel praline cookies and yes, bread pudding for offer. I was recovering from a long night of talking (not in a bad way) but was in high spirits. The cappucino I got was fantastic, the right balance between frothy and hot. A salted caramel added to my perk me up-pick my up, holding the attention of my taste buds. I slurped that bad boy rather than chew until I was all but slobbering caramely goodness. See I can be classy too!\n\nThe happy warming feeling inside was matched by mellow mood music and a nice guy behind the counter who made me my tasty beverage. He expertly made my drink, paying attention to detail while remaining friendly and charming with those of us indulging in the pleasures of Hooker's. The vibe is mellow like the library and unpretentious. Definitely a place to consider if you enjoy \"me time\" with your coffee. Maybe a tad bit pricey for an everyday excursion but just like people who indulge in the other kind of hooker in the neighborhood sometimes you just have to treat yourself to the talents and treats that someone new has to offer.

What a great find! I went into the store to buy an assorted 10-pack of salted caramels. I also ended up buying a bread pudding to take home, and they gave me re-heating instructions. The men in the store were extremely friendly and helpful, and it was nice to watch them making each caramel one-by-one right there. Both the caramels and the bread pudding were amazing. They were also a bargain - $20 for a 10-pack, and the caramels are BIG! Plus they are completely scrumptious. We will absolutely go back again for our own consumption and for gifts for others.", "author": "K B."}
