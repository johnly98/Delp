This is a constant issue regarding their chips which require little to no effort other than placing them in a paper bag. The funny part is that they even put a staple to seal the paper bag and 99% of the time when you already left and crack the bag open you'll find old stale chips that you paid for. \n\nIf a simple item such as chips are left unattended with out anyone knowing their expiration date nor how they taste, I am now wondering how they assure any general food quality?\n\nIn a burrito you will find that there is more rice than beans and more then 3x less meat than beans...which means that they are selling you a beans and rice burrito for the price of a protein one. \n\nThis is not about the kitchen crew who very much work their magic to prepare what you need. I think this is more on the Manager or whoever is the acting Manager for not knowing if the food is fresh or old.", "author": "Davis E."}

They used to put out hot sauces and the place was great with delicious food. Last time I tried it when I was going to Trader Joes I couldn't believe how bad the food has actually deteriorated. I thought I would try it one more time today and I'm standing there at 11:15 waiting for food and they keep ignoring me and I finally asked what time do you open? The dude says usually 11 but he's not ready yet and he points to the guy prepping the food while he's standing there doing absolutely nothing. Next I see the food prep guy bringing out the garbage cans instead of the guy who was just standing there doing nothing. I finally ordered a burrito and ended up having to throw it out it since it was that bad. It had absolutely no flavor at all, so disgusting. It's really sad how cheap they've gotten with their food and the fact they don't even put out hot sauce and you have to practically beg for it has made this place very lame. If you want good tacos and burritos go to Fistful of Tacos on Harrison as they blow this place away and their hot sauces are amazing!", "author": "VeeMaria L."}

The service lacks in motivation as they make no effort to let you know they're ready to take your order.  granted I'm 6 foot tall, but I couldn't see one person's head through their order window located at about 4 feet high.  After I made an effort to say hello I was greeted with a smirk.  I said \"ok\" and continued to ask for the salad.  The lady behind the glass window asked \"Filler?\"  I had NO clue what she was talking about.  taking a stab I asked \"Do you mean, what kind of meat would I like?\" and followed that with ordering chicken.  No more words were exchanged as I handed her my money and waited for my salad to arrive.\n\nThe food was good and with notes about Dos Pinas on the menu I figured as much.

I came here for lunch the other day and ordered the burrito morales (comes with avocado, lettuce, beans, rice, and jack cheese) with carnitas. I \"super-ed it\" for an additional $2.75 so I could get more avo (in the form of guac), sour cream, and jack.  When I got back to my office and excitedly began digging in, I noticed a lot of sour cream (which I don't necessarily mind) with a lot of beans and rice, and some carnitas in the mix, and absolutely no avocado or guacamole or lettuce. What a disappointment! I paid $10+ (I left a $1 and some change tip) for a burrito that should have had both avocado and guacamole and no trace of either (what a scam). To add insult to injury, the \"gentleman\" who prepared my burrito called my number and as I was walking up to retrieve my order, I was met with pseudo-creepy smiles and several winks and incoherent mutterings as I took the burrito from his hands (which he held onto a little longer than necessary).  I smiled back in return, regretfully ignoring his inappropriate conduct.  \n\nI will likely not eat here again and recommend you either do the same or watch them prepare your order so it's made right (to avoid being charged extra for non-existent avocado/guacamole).  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because previous experiences weren't so terrible.", "author": "Arlie A."}

Better than Chipotle, but not as good as sit down Mexican restaurants or Mexican places in the Mission (but what is?).\n\nI got the El Perfecto Carnitas Burrito for around $7.50 and it's definitely a sizable burrito that was hand crafted instantly and delivered into my arms within 1 minute! Blazing fast service, just how I like it. It was pretty much a super burrito with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, some other stuff probably, and meat. There was actually quite a bit of meat, like I could actually taste the carnitas and there were some big chunks of it in there. Second to the meat there was a lot of rice. I felt pretty guilty eating the rice and tortilla carbs. Gg.\n\nThe girl in front of me got the nachos, and boy let me tell you, she had me wishing I had gotten those instead. At a price of $4.75, I almost turned around and went to order myself one, but being so mentally strong (minus the fact that I came here in the first place since I was hungry), I forced myself to keep walking and settle with just the burrito.

Food and service.\n\nFirst the food: the Magnifico burrito was an ok burrito. Not exactly a Papalote or El Farolito burrito. Carne asada was sort of blah but ok, the  rice was on the tomato-y side, otherwise the fillings were pretty good and I'd give the burrito four out of five stars. Fairly large portion, but no chips or salsa included for the 8 dollar and something we paid for each one. Keep in mind with price comoarisons that the price one pays for a burrito at a restaurant usually includes things like salsa, chips, a sheltered table, restrooms, decorations or lighting\n\nNote: My boyfriend didnt feel so good after his burrito, its difficult to tell if it was directly causal or not. We're taking a neutral stance on that.\n\nSo why are my marks for this place so low? The service!\nLike other reviewers, i didn't appreciate the the  new young slouchy caucasian guy at the window. He was the kind of arrogant kid that thinks he's too good for the job, but clearly isn't. So, somewhat disenchanted,  boyfriend and I took our burritos to the table closest to the window, as it was the only one available. About two fifths through my burrito, a couple of pigeons perched in the pipes just above the table crapped on my head, face, both arms, and IN my burrito. So catastrophic, it splattered on everything. My boyfriend watched my bags while I ran to Trader Joes bathroom to wash my everything off.  When I returned with my hair wet, my boyfriend went to the order window to ask about what could be done. I stayed at the table. He told the guy what happened and he unsympathetically replied, \"Well, buy another burrito.\" My boyfriend is a hero and totally bought another, but the guy was a jerk about it and the last thing I wanted after losing half a burrito to a pigeon was to buy another from this jerk. Why should they make an extra sale at our expense off a problem they know about and don't fix? (They had that anti-pigeon netting above the counter area, but nothing to prevent pigeons from perching right above customers.) I insisted my boyfriend cancel the second order and we walked. Honestly, I was getting full and would have taken the rest for a snack like i usually do and I'd have been satisfied with half burrito or a small order of chips or something,  a drink, or even nothing, just an apology would have been nice. Its just not nice to pay for something and by no fault of your own, more the fault of the vendor, not get to enjoy it all.\n\nThat sign in their window says \"don't shop hungry\", but as long as that kid is working there, I'd rather starve than spend another penny here. Next time, I will just buy something inside Trader Joes's and buy myself a real burrito in a restaurant that has restaurant ambiance, amenities and service!", "author": "Lauren K."}

Then I decided maybe I should give the place a fourth try and order something I'd never had before.  That was Wednesday afternoon, and here I am writing a 4 star review for Publico Urban Taqueria.\n\nI think they refer to themselves as the \"Taco Truck with Zero Emissions\".  Clever.  It's literally a hole in the wall with a very limited menu.  Actually, considering the mini size of the place I'm surprised they offer as much as they do.  The little restaurant is located beside the parking lot inside the shopping complex at 555 Ninth Street kind of between the Peet's Coffee and Trader Joe's.\n\nEach time I ordered a burrito here I found the filling to be generously stuffed.  The filling barely fits inside the tortilla so if you like messy, drippy overstuffed burritos this place might be to your liking (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mJxt313SBvp9oM1EwpWt1w?select=eMHWhaemosd4AvKzRex5Pw).  Their base burrito contains rice, vegetarian black beans, queso (cheese), mild salsa (hot salsa is available upon request) and your choice between carne asada, pollo asado, chicken chile verde, al pastor or vegetarian.  I've tried the first three but have yet to go with the pork or the veggies.  I probably liked the chicken chile verde the best; however, the green sauce definitely needs more spice.  Fresh avocado, sour cream, guacamole and other ingredients can be added at extra cost.  My norm is adding sour cream (50 cents) and guacamole (1 dollar).  The burritos are wide and stumpy as opposed to the familiar sleek and narrow silver bullets of other taquerias.  I thought the burritos were nice and filling but nothing really special.\n\nI returned for a fourth time.  There were new items posted on the window.  Enchiladas in a mild \"rojo\" sauce !  I'll have to try those on my fifth visit!  I selected a Mexican Torta this time which I understood to be a Mexican sandwich.  I absolutely loved it a lot more than I did the burritos.  They take an ordinary looking sandwich roll, slit it open, hollow out some of the bread and add mayonnaise, jalapeno slices, fresh salsa, shredded lettuce, fresh avocado and a generous portion of the meat of your choice.  I selected the pollo asado.  Once the sandwich is made it is toasted hot to the point where the mayo has melted and the outer crust of the bread is hot and crispy.  Take a look at this (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mJxt313SBvp9oM1EwpWt1w?select=_Cl2DTJ8flrPju6nqYuGoA)!  The preparation time for this is a bit longer than the time for preparing a burrito, but in my opinion well worth it.  The torta was excellent!\n\nThey have refreshing agua frescas here too.  I've tried both the cantaloupe and the watermelon ones, and loved the watermelon one quite a bit.  Their prices are very gentle on the wallet too considering the large portions you are being fed.  It's cash only though so come prepared.  The restaurant uses recyclable and compostable products and utensils, has outdoor seating and posts a fine looking health score of 100.  The two young ladies that work there are very nice too.  This is a welcomed addition to my list of nearby lunch spots.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Most days when I passed by, there's a line and the seats are taken up but it was usually during lunch hour so it's sort of expected but if it's there's that many people there, it must be good, right?\n\nI show up at 11am and was the third in line and looked over the menu. I decided to go with the burrito bowl since I wasn't in the mood to use my hands on a burrito. The guy taking my order was friendly and my food was made pretty quickly. As for the burrito bowl itself, it was a pretty large portion and had the usual fixings of rice, beans, corn, salsa/pico de gallo, guacamole and meat (I got carne asada). Everything about it was good except one thing - the food was luke warm. I don't expect the food to necessarily be piping hot but this was on the brink of being cold almost.\n\nThat aside though, it was good, the guacamole was made with real avocado that I could taste. Nicely seasoned rice, a healthy serving of beans, meat and salsa. The lettuce, I could sort of do without but it was fine.

The only thing my street taco has is the tortilla and flavorful chicken mixed in Cilantro.  I love it because its satisfying and light.  \n\nWhy four stars?  Well, a few reasons.  \n\n1) The Publico closes early, typically between 6pm and 7pm.  This is a bad time because its around when I go for grocery shopping as well as dinner time.  The worst is getting there and finding that they closed early (this happens from time to time).\n\n2) The window where you order is made for short people.  I'm over 6 feet tall I have to get on my knees just to place an order.  Poorly designed ordering window.\n\n3) Publico is cash only.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-13", "description": "Ever go to the grocery store with the intention of just buying a few things so you just grab a basket.. and then realize that your basket is overflowing and things are falling out, and your arm is really sore from carrying it?  You then a) ditch the basket for a shopping cart, b) sort through the items to see if you can arrange them differently so you can stack them more efficiently, or c) start putting things that you want but don't NEED back.\n\nThis is how I viewed my experience at Publico.\n\nAfter passing by many times going to Trader Joe's, I finally decided that I needed a healthy dose of Mexican food.  I stopped by and ordered a carne asada street taco ($1.55!), a chicken crispy taco, and an order of nachos.\n\nThe grocery basket analogy applies to Publico's tacos.  When I opened the box for the carne asada taco, I saw that mounds of carne asada, cilantro and onions were crushing two tortillas, which were sitting sadly at the bottom of the pile.  I tried to pick the taco up, but there was no way I could even get the ends of the tortillas to remotely meet.  So, I congratulated myself for grabbing a fork while I was waiting for my food, and ate about half of the meaty filling until I could pick up the tortillas and eat it like a taco.  Even then, I still had tons of the tender, flavorful carne asada left inside, and it kept squishing out from the ends as I took each bite.\n\nThe crispy taco was less impressive.  The pollo was well-seasoned, there were huge dollops of fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and like its already-consumed street taco friend, the fillings were overflowing.  Outside the crunchy shell, they'd glued on a flour tortilla with some refried bean paste, and I wasn't a fan of that.  If it'd just been a crunchy taco shell, Publico would've earned my 5 stars, as well as my love and never-ending affection, right here and now.\n\nThe nachos were the least impressive, as it had what tasted like store-bought Taco Bell nacho cheese (don't get me wrong though, I love Taco Bell), too much refried bean paste, guacamole, pico, carrots (?!) and jalapenos.  Not a fan, and I probably won't be ordering this again.\n\nAll in all, Publico is a surprisingly good, cheap, fast place in the heart of the Brannan/Bryant/9th St. shopping center.  Cash only.

I'm a fan of this new PUT because it's also convenient.\n\nPublico specializes in fresh food. It's nothing fancy - your average enchiladas, street tacos, quesadillas, frijoles y filling etc. - but it gets the job done. The service is fast, just like at the old PUT and the prices are low enough that you'll want to keep coming back. Mind, it's not dirt cheap but low enough. \n\nMy favorites? Al pastor and chicken chile verde street tacos.

They charged me $18 for 2 super burritos and didn't give me chips. Every other Taqueria i've ever been to in and out of the United States gives you chips and salsa,guacamole to go with the chips for free. These guys are idiots and i am never going there again. The only reason i didn't make a scene right there was because i was on my lunch break. They have a stupid sign up saying that all prices are final and that there is no bartering,negotiating etc. These idiots wouldn't need that stupid sign if they would just charge what Taqueria's normally charge and give chips. This is the most expensive Taqueria i have been to in San Francisco in the last 11 years. They will get no repeat business from me. I recommend skipping this place and going to Taqueria Cancun on the corner of 6th and Market. The burrito's didn't taste how burrito's normally taste. They are scamming. They aren't running a restaurant, they no overhead cost, when i went there i only saw 2 people, they work in what almost looks like a painted up wooden outdoor shed and they are charging more money and not giving simple things like chips and salsa and guacamole. I've been to several other Taqueria's that are actually restaurants,have to pay overhead cost, have several employee's and still manage to charge a good price, offer a better service, and offer things that chips,guacamole,salsa free of charge. I'm not the kind of guy who would normally feel the need to ask about things like this before placing my order because other places normally do it right. It would be like going to McDonalds and ordering a number 2 and not getting french fries.", "author": "che p."}
