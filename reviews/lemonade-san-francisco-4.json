I was reminded today why we dont go there anymore. Its overpriced and the portions are a bit skewed. The food is good but the portions are a bit frustrating.\n\nTake the poke bowl with rice. Youre pretty much paying for a bowl of rice with fish garnish. As a place that seeeeems to be health cautious, youre just giving people fillers. Id at least expect almost equal parts fish and rice. Instead, its a small layer of fish on top of a mountain of rice. \n\nI guess a new menu is available and today i got a Backyard BBQ Brisket bowl. You could ask \"what bbq?\" As they proceed to fill the bowl with like 2-2.5 servings of mashed potatoes and very little veggies (you cant even choose which!) And bbq brisket. I asked for MORE veggies afterwards as what they gave is a ridiculous amount of mashed potatoes. AGAIN, fillers. Who the hell eats THAT much mashed potatoes in one go? Also, what they serve is NOTHING like the photo (are they ever really?) Where you couldnt even tell there was potatoes underneath. Its like looking into a thick bowl of soup with, again, garnish.

I also tried one of their \"Skinny T\" drinks - the blood orange with blue butterfly flower tea.

Lemonade came highly recommended by Crisy as they have a ton of selections for healthy eats.  Love that they also offer a good selection for vegetarian. What I didn't know is they have tons of locations all over California.\n\nCrisy recommended their Curried Cauliflower with Golden Raisins and Almonds which was fantastic. We both ordered their Pineapple Chicken & Green Beans with Toasted Coconut, Jalapenos, and Jerk Dressing since it was just too good to pass.  Turned out, it was our favorite. If you get a chance, order Lemonade's Seared Pepper Crusted Ahi Tuna with Crushed Orange-Ginger Ponzu.  It was very fresh and ask for a side of sauce.  Lastly, Crisy and I had their freshly pressed Watermelon Rosemary.  It was refreshing and refills cost an additional $1.95.\n\nBest of all, I was able to pay with my SamsungPay (mobile payment and digital wallet service) and quadruple my rewards points.  Woo-hoo!!

Otherwise, you know my fat ass would have went ham on those beef tallow fries at Calibur. \n\nI've been wanting to try this much hyped SoCal based chain since Lemonade opened their first NorCal location (Yerba Buena). I love their concept of serving seasonal, Californian style cuisine with global influences that's fast, healthy, and affordable - at least that's what their website states. \n\nThe cafeteria-style set-up offers Marketplace [veggie] sides, Salads, Sandwiches, Land & Sea (chicken & fish), Hot Braised Dishes, and delicious sounding Comfort Food like truffle mac & cheese. Lots of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options available. They also offer 6 seasonal flavors of Lemonade.\n\nEverything about Lemonade sounds five stars worthy but I found it to be overhyped and overrated. \n\nLemonade is the SLOWEST fast-casual eatery I've ever been to. From the first counter to the register, it took over 20 minutes! Keep in mind, everything is prepared and sitting in trays already except for the sandwiches that need to be assembled. We had 30 minutes before Tater Tot's appointment which I thought would be enough time and it wasn't. If you're in a rush, don't come here. \n\nMy friend and I shared 3 marketplace sides, 1 hot dish, 1 poke, and 1 lemonade and the total was $31: http://bit.ly/2lACwVG! There's \"expensive and worth it\" like good sushi but Lemonade is in the \"expensive but not worth it\" category. \n\n*Snap Peas & Edamame: Ok but needed acid to brighten things up.\n*Avocado & Cherry Tomatoes: Incredibly salty and sour (unripe tomatoes).\n*BLT Panzanella: Super salty.\n*Red Miso Beef Short Ribs: Inedible SALT BOMB!\n*Ahi & Avocado Poke: Best item we had. Nice chunks of fresh tuna and chunks of buttery avocado; not overdressed with soy. \n*Blood Orange Lemonade: Very sweet but good flavor. Tasted much better after all the ice melted. \n\nVery disappointing and expensive for a cafeteria-style meal. We left hungry because we couldn't eat the majority of things on the plate because it was so salty. \n\nLemonade may have good intentions of offering \"healthy\" food to consumers but it defeats the purpose when you're dumping a sh*t ton of salt in the food and loads of sugar in the lemonade. I did a keyword search for \"salty\" and \"sweet\" for their other locations (including the ones in SoCal) and there were lots of complaints of food being overly salty (even salads) and overly sweet lemonade. \n\n1 star for the poke, 1 star for the lemonade (after the ice melted), and .5 stars for the dog-friendly outdoor seating but rounding down because of the slow, and not so friendly service.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "Following my two positive experiences with the Lemonade down by the Metreon, I was pretty excited to see that their West Portal location had finally opened.  In part because the food isn't too shabby, but mostly because the location is so much more convenient!  Besides the fact that it's closer to where I live (relatively, at least), but parking here is so much easier.  Plus, it's not nearly as busy - no crowds during the lunch rush here!\n\nIf you've ever been to a Lemonade before, this one isn't any different.  Not only is the food the same (salads, sandwiches, hot dishes, sides, desserts/cookies, and lemonades, of course), but the set-up is identical as well (the layout is cafeteria-style, but you can hop the line to any section you want).  Oddly though, despite having the opportunity to try something new (like their salads or a hot dish), I ended up with almost the exact same order as my very first trip to Lemonade.  Whoops.\n\n-- AVOCADO SALMON LOUIE with Grapefruit Segments and Pickled Cucumber...$6.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-4?select=_oTXE3igjQgckdna17ZxSA)\nArguably pricey for what it is, but it's pretty darn tasty as well.  Not only is there a decent amount of salmon, but it tasted fresh and flavorful.  What's more, the avocado was at the perfect ripeness - creamy and soft (though not mushy).  Love the acidity the grapefruit and pickled cucumbers added as well.\n\n-- GANDOLFINI - Turkey, Chicken, Ham, Swiss, Pepperoncini, and Olives...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-4?select=Ib9tjalGGjwHDGqodanb2Q)\nWhile this may have been the same sandwich that I had before, it wasn't nearly as good this time. Rather than being served hot, toasted, and gooey, this one was tepid and untoasted.  It may not seem like much, but not having the melted cheese and toasted bread made all the difference.  For what it was though, this was...okay.\n\n-- BLOOD ORANGE LEMONADE...$3.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lemonade-san-francisco-4?select=hh6NXmAHFBsB42dHaBhynQ)\nAlthough it was a little bit sweeter than I remember it being, this was no less delicious than  the first time I had this.  The bit of tartness from the lemonade was a nice complement to the blood orange, making this ever so refreshing, even on a relatively chilly night (though that's practically every night on this side of SF).\n\nEven with the misstep in my sandwich's preparation, service here was definitely better than at the Metreon/Yerba Buena location.  Not that the workers over there were bad, just that the ones here were extra helpful and friendly.  Perhaps a benefit of not having to deal with hectic lunch crowds during the week?  Even with all of the small businesses and families out this way, I can't imagine it getting nearly as crazy.\n\nIn any case, it really is a shame that the food fell short of my last couple of experiences.  I still like Lemonade and I'd definitely come back again; there are plenty of other things I'd want to try and it's far easier to come here than the Metreon or soon-to-open 9th Ave locations.  It's just that it's more likely to happen when I'm already nearby in the area than as a destination.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS rounded down.", "author": "Mike L."}

Also, it's not a lot of chicken for the price. \n\nThe ahi tuna and avocado poke ($6.95) comes in a relatively decent sized cup and was pretty good! First, I loved that there were LARGE chunks of tuna, and avocado (and tangerines). Second, the flavor was great mixed in with sauce and sesame.\n\nWhat was also pretty good was the white truffle mac n cheese ($4.50). The mac n cheese was nice, white, and creamy with good texture. Plus, the truffle was clearly present and added excellent flavor to the mac n cheese. Yum! \n\nThe workers were just as positive as the bright colors of the restaurant. They encouraged sampling and asked for food allergies prior to offering. I tried the brussel sprouts, which were nice and crunchy. I also love their wide variety of lemonade flavors including watermelon rosemary, pomegranate tarragon, cucumber mint, blood orange, and original. \n\nLike many food crazes, Lemonade came from LA and is now spreading into NorCal. The food is not the most outstanding quality individually, but the variety is large and the food is fresh, flavorful, and healthy. Some selections are seasonal.

The style is like being in a cafeteria. You grab a tray and walk into the station of your desire, tell the person what you want and you pay at the end of each item you get! Outside seating has heating lamps so you won't freeze sitting there. \n\nMy favorite to get here is the watermelon Radish with ahi tuna and white Truffle Mac n' Cheese! The watermelon Radish is something light and refreshing and the white Truffle mac n' cheese is one of the best I've ever had. Creamy with a good amount of Truffle flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. There was a great selection of different Lemonade flavors. I got the watermelon lemonade and it was so refreshing & light. Goes great with the food. Will totally go back to try more flavors. \n\nAs far as service goes, for their first time opening it went really well. Some things were a little disorganized because some customers didn't know they could go to any station and not have to wait in line. Prices are a bit too high for me to come here often! \n\nOverall, great place to grab a quick lunch or have a light dinner!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

Pre-made salads, proteins, poke, sandwiches, salads, hot entrees and marvelous desserts. They switch up their dishes everyday keepin it fresh!\n\nOoooo la la lemonade!! I SEE YOU! ;)\n\nCame two days post grand opening for my birthday movie night with friends. From hard core vegans to \"anything is plenty maine\" - all my friends loved it. \n\nYeah, it's pricey.

I just didn't care for the sugar free flavors.  They have outdoor seating and their location makes it a great people watching spot.

Walking in, you're faced with a line of salads, cold dishes, and hot dishes, and you can either choose all your items a la carte or get a combo plate for a slight discount. Coming in for lunch, I ordered the \"Big Chill\" plate, which consisted of two \"marketplace\" salads and one \"land and sea\" option. For my salads, I got the kale/kumquat salad, which had a surprising spicy kick to it, as well as the shaved brussels sprouts with dates. Both of these tasted so fresh and delicious and were perfect for a hot summer day! For my \"land and sea\" option, I got the salmon/avocado louie salad, a refreshing composed salad of cooked salmon and chunks of creamy avocado, all in an aioli and mustard-based dressing. Every bite of this was delicious--the salmon was so tender and the avocado so creamy! The plate also came with a parmesan crisp, which added the perfect crunchy element when combined with bites of the salad.\n\nOverall, I'm in love with the Lemonade concept and the flavors of their food--everything here somehow looks soo enticing, and I'll be back to sample more of their options!", "author": "David K."}

First, prior to visiting this location I'd never been to a lemonade before, so I didn't really know how the portions worked and I asked for the wrong container.  The service was slow as hell. I stood there for five minutes waiting for someone to come out from the back and was getting ready to leave when someone finally came. All of the workers looked as though they hated life.\n\nI got two different salad sides, one of which was a Brussel sprout concoction that was gross. I think it had dates in it and was way too sweet. I also got Mac n cheese, which was very basic. It reminded me of the Mac n cheese you find in the freezer section at the super market. Oh, and they ran out of mashed potatoes, which is my favorite comfort food ever, so I was bummed. I think the only good thing was the short ribs, which I'd order again. \n\nI think I'll definitely give this place another try because there are so many options, but I'm not in much of a rush.", "author": "Steph L."}

When I saw one pop up in West Portal, I made sure to check it out. It's formatted as a cafeteria, with hot sides in one area, entrees in another, and cold salad sides when you first come in. The cold salad sides are the cheapest and beyond the mac and cheese, I think everything else here is a little overpriced. We ended up getting 4 cold salad sides ($3.25 each) and it was a great pre-dinner meal for me and my BF.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCurried cauliflower: This was really good! The flavoring was good\nSoba noodles & kimchi vegetables: This has always been my favorite side, slightly creamy and tangy, but not too heavy\nAvocado and cherry tomatoes: Another one of my favorites, although be warned the lime flavor makes it pretty sour and salty. \nPoached albacore tuna: There wasn't much tuna in this one, a lot of potatoes and veggies, but still not bad\n\nThere isn't much order or direction when ordering so the line wasn't really moving along without anyone directing us or helping us along.", "author": "Jingxi Z."}

You can definitely taste both but it has a very clean taste. \n\n2. Blood Orange: I like this a lot also but it was a bit sweet for me. The Blood orange has a very distinct taste and it blends well with the lemonade. \n\n3. Watermelon Rosemary: Also very good. The watermelon is subtle and I didn't really taste the rosemary. I didn't realize how good watermelon mixed with lemonade. \n\n4. Strawberry Rhubarb: I didn't really like this flavor.

I love the variety of salads they offer - some are vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free so there are plenty of options for those folks.

Aside from salads (Marketplace - $2.95), there are protein options (Land & Sea - ~$6.95), sandwiches (~7.95), mac n cheese ($4.95), a soup, and a few hot options.\n\nMost items are under $8, but a meal won't be cheap if you want to mix and match (which is what they recommend). For two people who each ordered a Land & Sea, two Marketplaces, and a lemonade, the total came out to about $40, which is pretty pricey considering this is a cafeteria-style establishment. \n\nThe lemonades are great! They don't seem to have as many flavors here as the downtown location, but they make up for it by offering sugar-free versions. \n\nIf you know exactly what you want and don't want to go through the whole line to look at all the offerings, you can just head straight to the cashier after you've gotten your order.

I also got the BLT salad, which is really good and definitely hits the spot when you just want something light. \n\nThe best part, however, was the coconut Apple lime lemonade. That sounds like an odd combination, but I was obsessed the minute I tasted it. I got the blood orange one last time, which was also good but in my opinion doesn't compare to this one. It was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy, and honestly if you're a fan of coconut this lemonade is a must! \n\nMy meal total was around $12.50 which is a bit pricy, but I still enjoyed it and would definitely come back again! \n\nAlso, the staff is all really sweet and helpful.", "author": "Anila K."}

Well let me get the lemonade later.  Let's talk location.   Lemonade took over the old La Boulange.    It feel bittersweet walking back in there knowing what it used to be.  The place is more bright and clean looking.  They still have seating outside with heat lamps, but who wants to sit outside with their salad on a  cold San Francisco winter day.   This place is very close to the West Portal train station, so you can easily walk there.  My boss took us here for lunch today so it was very easy for us to get here.  \n\nWe got here around 12 and there was already a huge crowd.   I think a lot of people wanted to check out the new kid on the block.   There was a waitress in the front asking us if it was our first time here.  She took her time explaining to us how it all works.  So you can order at any place in the line as long as you what you want.  It's broken down by MarketPlace, Leafy greens, Land and Sea, Sandwiches, Hot dishes, desserts and Lemonade.  Their Marketplace are different types of salads.  It's broken into three sections, vegan, Vegetarian, and with protein.   You can do one of the salads for as little as $2.95 a portion. I recommend doing one of their popular suggestions.  You get to try a little of everything.  You can pick 2 Marketplace options plus an item from the land and sea, or Sandwich plus a leafy green as a side, or a full leafy green order plus land and sea.  I know the options maybe overwhelming but don't hesitate to as for a sample.  They give you samples with a smile on their faces! \n\nOk enough talk, lets get to the food.  So i ended up doing the 2 marketplace items plus the land and sea. I ordered the Shaved brussels sprouts and dates and the curry cauiiflower as my two marketplace items.  For the land and sea there was NO WAY i was going to turn down the Salmon Louie Stuffed Avocado.  The curry Cauliflower was not too spicy. There are times i tastede a mild spice and times i didn't.  I love cauliflower so this was very interesting.  Actually this tasted like an egg salad, except it had a more sweet taste because of the golden raisins and almonds.    The Shaved Brussels sprouts and dates was soooo good!  I loved how  the dates there chopped so perfectly where it mixed well with the brussel sprouts. The parmesan did not overwhelm the salad.  There are times when i get salads at other places the cheese overpowered the salad.  This was perfect!  However, this was not my favorite dish. My most favorite dish was the Salmon Louie Stuffed Avocado.  Have you ever had a tuna melt?  Well imagine that this is very similar.  Salmon melt over an avocado.  They give you enough salmon to go with every bite of the avocado.  The avocado was very fresh because you can always tell when an avocado turns color, and this one was so green.  I loved this so much i can eat a dozen of these for lunch! And last but not least, the Lemonade.  I got the old fashion one, because i always believe that you can't call yourself Lemonade if you can't nail this item.  And they did nail it.  i love how it was tarty, and it wasn't sweet.  I can't stand it when people add sugar to the drinks. \n\nThe service as pretty good.  The cashier who took our order made sure everything was ok and got everything for us when we were missing items.  She came to check on us twice.  And the waiter came and took our empty dishes away when we were done and told us to take our time. He didn't even rush us.  My only complaint is that this place is super cold.  They had both doors open and come on, it's winter in SF,  you need to keep your doors closed.  Our their doors handles were slices of lemonade.  How cute is that?! The rest of my coworkers loved their food, not a crumb was left.  Great place to have  a meal with your friends and kids.  The next time i come back here, i need to try their desserts!", "author": "Belinda C."}

They have a lot of quality salads, sides, and hot dishes that are consistently cooked well and tasty. My favorite thing to get here is the \"Cozy Comfort\" combination. You get one salad (kale, beets, shredded Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, tons of other good stuff). one hot side (roasted Brussels Sprouts, or roasted cauliflower, or roasted seasonal vegtables, etc etc. all really good.), and one hot main dish (slow cooked, braised Texas brisket or Korean short rib, or roasted chicken, etc. etc.), good stuff!

You start off at the market place which includes all the healthy sides and salads. They assign you a number at this station so all subsequent orders will be placed under that number for convenience. \n\nThen you have the sandwich station, where those guys are made to order. Then you have the Land/Sea section, which includes ready-made proteins like salmon, chicken, and beef. Then we have the hot sides, which include my recommended favorite truffle mac and cheese. Oh lord that stuff is delicious and I can eat that forever and ever. This section is tempting because everything looks so good when it's piping hot and in big batches. \n\nNext is a glass case containing desserts which house things like big ass macarons, which I have not tried but they look pretty decent. And huge. \n\nLastly, you have the cashier station and located behind them are waterfalls of different lemonades. I recommend the blood orange lemonade, it's not too sweet and it's super refreshing. \n\nThis place is great to grab healthy (and not-so healthy sides) food but it is pretty pricey. For a complete meal, you'd probably spend around $15 give or take.

You just gotta try it yourself. I also ordered the miso pulled pork, mashed potatoes, those weren't bad either. The food scooper at the hot food station was very thoughtful and also gave me samples, she also was the cashier too. Shout out to Jia, after I told her how much I like the mac and cheese. She showed me a recipe cook book, that has most of the dishes at the Lemonade restaurant. But that's not all, the second best part after the white truffle mac and cheese is the different lemonades available. There's plain, blood orange, watermelon, rosemary and tons more. Jia also told me that you don't only have to get one lemonade, you can also mix and match the different flavors of lemonade. I took her recommendation of mixing  plain lemonade, blood orange lemonade and watermelon lemonade. My new combo lemonade was not too sour or too sweet, but perfect.

You would think you could ask at one station for all of them. Nope.  When I asked at the protein section, the girl rolled her eyes and stomped over to the same book the last lady looked at.  Then she was bitching to her co-workers about it.  So, I kindly expressed that my diet is medical and I am not trying to be a pain in the ass.\n\nIt came down to two items that I could eat -- I find this hard to believe. I was so exhausted that I ordered them and didn't bother with the other sections.  I ordered the shredded Brussels sprout salad with dates and the chicken with a yogurt sauce.  The lady didn't heat the cold chicken or even take the paper off it, as she threw it on my plate...kind of gross and rude.

It took us a while before we could figure out what to order. They have a lot of different salads but everything looked like it's been sitting around for a while and drenched or wilted with dressing.  $13.50 for 2 scoops of room temperature salad and a small piece of lukewarm salmon.  My son had the Mango chicken which was very dry because it's been sitting out too long.  The rice and kale with it was good.  They do have good lemonade.  We ordered a blood orange and tangerine.  My daughter's dish came with fresh baked crisp but it wasn't offered to her.  When I asked,  the cashier said they ran out.  So why didn't they mention it or offer me a substitution? I had to ask for it so the cashier said he can give me bread.  I said ok.  Waited for a while and asked if he had forgotten.  He said he thought I didn't want it. Speechless!!! Then they ran out of forks.  No metal or plastic forks.  When I asked,  he went to check and said they're being washed right now and will take a while.  So I asked if they had plastic forks and he went to get them.  Seriously??? Nobody checks? I had to ask for him to get the plastic forks so my kids and I can eat. The chairs were stained and the canvas back rest were dirty. The only good thing about this place is the very nice African American lady helping us with the food and their lemonade.

Only cold vegan choices, weird blends of salads, without anything great. The lamb meatballs were described as three tough bland balls in a flavorful sauce.\n The salad preparer seemed overwhelmed. He couldn't figure out the dressings, We waited several minutes for one dressing and that was harshly flavored. He reused the same bowl as the portion control so you got an interesting blend of other salads mixed in with your choice. \nWandered back and forth to figure out what to order and when I asked questions of the staff I got little help. \nI'm not sure if I'd go back. There are some great choices for sit down, well made meals within one block for about the same price.", "author": "Art R."}

There are multiple layers to ordering - Marketplace Salads , (with 3 subtypes of salads), Land &Sea, Leafy Greens, Hot Dishes and Sandwich stations along a cafeteria style line. On top of this there are bundled \"Plates\" - e.g. The Big Chill, Farmers Marketplace, Cozy Comfort, etc.- which combine components for each of the other stations. It's so complicated that they have a handout menu (that doesn't make it clear), and the staff - of which there are many (surprising how many given how slow the line moves) don't even know what the Plates include.  are either.

Like most Lemonade I've been to, this one is pretty standard. You order kind of buffet style and you pay when you get to the cashier. \n\nI always enjoy walking by the food and deciding what to get. I really love their poke, brussel sprouts, and truffle mac n' cheese. These are probably their stables to Lemonade. I did hear that they change their menu once a while so you always get a pretty good variety of food. I always end my meal with a blood orange lemonade, which is my absolute favorite! The guava lemonade is also tasty, but too bad that one is only seasonal. \n\nOverall, this is a great spot if you're looking to eat a healthier meal. Yes, it could get pricey depending on what you get and how much you order. I do think it's reasonable for the quality of the food you're paying for.

Oh and then I indulged in the Salmon Louie Salad that also had avocado in a nice creamy dill sauce. I ordered Original Lemonade was perfect to wash it all down. To top it all off they have macarons the size of your palm I had the raspberry, it had that little crunchy exterior with a little chewy inside of the cookie and a light creamy strawberry filling, can you tell I liked it?

It's just that there was nothing I ate that really blew me away and the prices are a little bit high.  I didn't mind the cafeteria style, but I can't say I'm a big fan of chain restaurants.  The Citrus Poached Salmon was well cooked, served cold and had good flavor.  The White Truffle Mac N Cheese was exactly what you'd expect, good, but nothing unique. The best part of my meal was the New Mexican Chili Roasted Butternut Squash, very flavorful and the most inexpensive thing on my plate.  \nI opted to get the sugar-free Pomegranate Tarragon Lemonade, my strong advice, opt for the sweetened version. The staff was obviously new, very friendly, but over-eager considering all the choices to ponder.  \nYou can get samples of anything, but there's no place for you to put your dirty sample cup when you're done. So you have to leave it on your tray. It's a little awkward. \nOverall give it a marginal thumbs up, yet not someplace I'd enthusiastically recommend.

The employees were all courteous and the order was on time. I expected to love their texas brisket but the size was pretty small-it was tasty but small for $8.  Their truffle oil mac n cheese was tasty & creamy and a good enough portion so no complaints.  I'm not a fan of overly sweetened drinks so their lemonade was way too sweet for me.  I have to say what blew my mind was their coconut cake-  the cake layers weren't just ordinairy sponge or regular cake layers.  Instead, all the cake layers were mixed with coconut so along with the coconut frosting, it really woke you up! It was very sweet but for a dessert, i don't mind it sweet.  I wanted to give it at least a 4 stars, but it doesn't pass my \"price to value\" score.  Of course, it's the pricey West Portal, but Calibur, Submarine Center, and Burrito Loco are less than half a block away and yet I view them as scoring higher.
