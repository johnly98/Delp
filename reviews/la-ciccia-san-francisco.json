It's one of those almost impossible to get reservations in SF so I came right at opening and got a seat at the bar (there are 5 seats for walk-ins).  I asked about their signature dishes and the bartender recommended the Baby Octopus, Sea Urchin and Tuna Heart Pasta and the Saffron Ricotta Cake.  \n\nAll of the dishes were just the right combination of unique and tasty.  I found myself asking for a lot of bread so I can soak up all of the wonderful sauces in both the baby Octopus (that tomato sauce had just the perfect amount of spice for that nice \"kick\") and the sea urchin and tuna heart pasta. The sea urchin and tuna heart pasta was definitely one of the best plates of food I've ever had (it's going on the last supper menu).  The chef gave a sample of the tripe - I've only had Asian preparation but I really liked this. The saffron Ricotta cake was very unique from a texture perspective and was the right amount of sweetness.  Lemon soda and mint tea were my beverage pairings for the evening. \n\nThe service was spectacular and they really gave me a warm family vibe. From an ambiance perspective, this place made me feel like I was vacationing in Italy. I'll be coming back. Highly recommended!!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

We were lucky to snag a reservation (well, maybe not too lucky since I woke up at midnight 30 days before to get it) as we love pasta and are constantly looking for a place. \n\nWe got two pastas: the fish roe and squid ink. HANDS DOWN the fish roe pasta was the better of the two and we would definitely get that again! It was incredibly delicious, maybe one of the top 5 dishes I've had in SF. The pasta had a lovely texture as well. \n\nThe squid ink was a bit disappointing - I think next time we will plan on getting the sea urchin pasta instead.\n\nThe restaurant itself is tiny and has a cute mom and pop feel to it - and definitely feels very authentic.

I think the flavors were interesting, but nothing wowed me. The place is tucked away in Noe with a super unassuming exterior, and usually that would mean you step inside and it's totally different but it was pretty plain inside too. But busy! Place was packed. As uncharming as the setting was, the service wasn't that much better.\n\nWe picked this place for a small birthday gathering, started with a bottle of wine, the sardinian flatbread ($10 for a crisp is kinda steep) and the baby octopus stew. Then the squid ink pasta and sea urchin pasta, maybe the lamb, probably also something else? It was unfortunately pretty forgettable and I don't think we talked about the food at all. We were a chatty bunch about all sorts of other things in our life, so maybe we just were too busy to talk about the food but I think it means we weren't impressed. I'd give it another go though, since the menu is so interesting and boyfriend loved it so much. \n\n$300 for 4 people.", "author": "Vivian H."}

No. This is in your face squid ink. So hard to find in USA. \n\nThe shrimp is yet another simple but unexplainably amazing. The only thing I can think of is the quality of the ingredients and the respect it's given.\n\nThe Semifreddo was the best dessert but the squid ink panna cotta was the most interesting.

Perfect for a date night- came here on a Friday night 8pm reservation.  \n\nVenue / Service: hope you aren't claustrophobic, because this area is \"cozy\" / tight.  Not a great place if you have a large bag / suitcase b/c tables are really close to each other, mind you.  Surprisingly wasn't too loud though, which is a plus.  Also helps that the servers are very attentive and we had no trouble asking for anything.  \n\nFood: overall, a lot of bold flavors with less components.  My date and I split all dishes so we could taste everything.\n-- Calamareddusu Arrustiusu cun Frabia (Roasted Monterey Calamari, Basil Oil Greens)($16) - very clean tasting, allowing you to taste the calamari.  This one was recommended by the waiter (after the spicy octopus), and the basil left a nice light feel to the palette so you don't feel like you have fishy mouth.\n\n-- Pasta Longa cun su Nieddu de Seppia (Fresh Linguine Seafood Sugo Lemon Zest Squid Ink)($20) - of the two pastas, this was our favorite.  The addition of the lemon zest added much-needed acidity to the dish, especially when dealing with squid ink.  Pasta was cooked well and not a huge amount of sauce, but still tasty.  \n\n-- Maccarones de Busa cun Arrizonis (Sardinian Macaroni Sea Urchin Tomato grated Tuna Heart)($24) - this is highly recommended by the staff and I agree that this is the most interesting flavor combo I've had.  The tuna heart added a nice, rich flavor to the macaroni, and the sea urchin, while subtle, added a bit of brininess.  This one is on the richer side, and I don't think I would have been able to finish this dish alone.  \n\n-- Pezza de Angioni a sa Saba (Seared Lamb Tenderloin Tagliata drizzled with Saba)($29) - the lamb itself was cooked very well (medium rare, how we like it)!  Though I tend to prefer just simple grill / salt + pepper, the saba (grape must reduction) drizzle was a great hit of acid to the gamey lamb.  My date wasn't as crazy for it as I was, so perhaps this is a hit or miss.  \n\nMeal came out to ~$45 / person excluding drinks, which seems reasonable given portion sizes and how we finished all of the dishes!  \nAll in all, I think this is an awesome spot for a cozy date night.  Probably not for those who are claustrophobic or have a really big party.", "author": "Audrey H."}

I was so happy they did. I honestly never heard of it until my girlfriend booked it for me. The service here was not bad, they were always checking in on us and asking us for a refill. The bar tender was kind enough to let us sample different kinds of wine for our likings.\nIt was a really small place and very compact. Dim light setting, great for any occasion. \n\nI've never been to a fine dining Italian restaurants so the dishes were a little complicated, but the server was nice enough to give us recommendations. She recommended us I couldn't remember if it was fettuccine or alfredo pasta, anyways it was really delicious! I enjoyed having that dish and definitely complimented our other dishes. I recommend this !\n\nWe ordered the calamari dish and wow, that was pretty different from what I ever had. I totally did not expect how it would be cooked. I normally have fried calamari and I would be able to tolerate it. The way they cooked it was as if it was almost raw. That was definitely quite the experience.\n\nLastly, we had the lamb! The lamb was so gooood! You guys need to try this. I know lamb may sound weird but it was so tender and juicy. They cooked it medium rare and tasted perfect. Chewy, consistent and a lot of flavor. They added bell peppers on the side, eat it together with the lamb! I wished they brought this dish out at the same time as the pasta. I didn't like how they wouldn't bring out any other dish until you were finished with your current one. \n\nThank you for having us La Ciccia!", "author": "Alex L."}

My suggestion is to order the side of flatbread which is served with the most fragrant, delicious olive oil ever! \n\nWe ordered four dishes: the calamari, octopus stew, squid ink linguine, and pork spaghetti (which was a special that evening). ORDER ALL THESE THINGS. The calamari was perfectly roasted and tender, the octopus stew came with the best tomato base and we just had our spoons in there trying to get the last scoop. \n\nI have dreams about the squid ink linguine people! The slight hint of lemon makes an ordinary dish, extraordinary.

The pastas (especially bottarga one) were disgustingly tasty. In the best way possible. \n\nStandouts:\n1) Bottarga pasta - the money maker here. It's just SO GOOD! I couldn't stop inhaling it. The pasta was perfectly al dente and topped with just enough olive oil and seasoning with that umami flavor from the bottarga flakes.\n\n2) Pork sugo pasta - I feel like any pasta other than bottarga is like the less impressive sibling in a family of overachievers. I really enjoyed this dish - the shape of the pasta was super cute, the pork itself was crumbly and soaked up the tomato sauce so well. I think it was a good balance to the bottarga pasta but... you just can't outshine your older sister when she's like a Harvard MD. If you know what I mean.\n\n3) Ricotta honey cake - Yes. Just do it. It's the best way to end the meal. Not too sweet, not too rich.\n\nGreat service the whole night! Not super pretentious for such a nice establishment. Place a res here!

Luckily I went there twice in a month. I had the best pasta of my life. I ordered flat bread, uni pasta, squid pasta, lamb and fish. \nStarting with olive oil with their homemade bread. They charge $2 for the olive oil but trust me it's worth it. Their flat bread is really good, it's like a thin crispy bread with cheese, olive oil and rosemary on top of it. I would recommend to request for the half size(they do that). I think we should leave some space for the yummylicious pasta and other entree. Then we got the sea urchin pasta and squid spaghetti mmmmmmm soooooo good, very rich in flavor but very heavy. You can easily share one pasta dish with 3 people.

There's a lot of Italian restaurants out there but this is specifically Sardinian specializing in seafood pasta dishes. \n\nIt's pretty hard to get a reservation, since it's tiny (more on that later): we tried to get one a week in advance a few times with no luck. We finally went for Valentine's weekend after booking one month in advance.\n\nThe two of us ordered:\n-Roasted Monterey calamari with basil, greens and oil: this was a great appetizer! I love not-fried calamari appetizers and this was well cooked with excellent flavors.\n-Fresh Spaghetti Spicy Garlic Oil Salt Cured Fish Roe: This is their signature dish and was our favorite dish. The fish roe flavor is great -rich but not too fishy. The portion isn't too big so when you split it for 2, it's just the right amount. The spaghetti is a pretty chewy/borderline al dente. I like that but if you like your spaghetti softer, you might want to mention it.\n-Sardinian macaroni with Sea Urchin Tomato Shaved Tuna Heart: We chose this dish since it seemed so exotic and was recommended by the waiter. I love uni and expected a lot but honestly it was like a vaguely fishy tomato cream sauce pasta. Not bad but the flavor was very subtle.\n\n-Wine: we were really impressed with the wine selection from the waiter. Of the two we had, my favorite was the Monica di Sardegna Superiore Azienda Agricola Podere Parpinello 2013, a lighter red wine. Highly recommend. \n\nThe staff here is polite, welcoming and professional. The biggest con would probably be how small the restaurant is. The tables are very close together and I didn't enjoy listening to my neighbor's conversation. I'm honestly shocked how well the waiters managed to get around between the tables. I also liked that this is a bit off the beaten path of SF so parking is not as hard to find. \n\nAll in all, a great, unique restaurant -- we'll be back!", "author": "Ninette C."}

The restaurant reminds me of one of those local Italian restaurants in Jersey or Long Island that is upscale and where the local Italians flock. What is unique about this restaurant is that it specializes in seafood pasta and Sardinian cuisine. \n\nBecause I am on a ketones diet, I stayed away from the pasta but loved the two dishes I chose which they also graciously agreed to make according to my diet specifications. I had the required squid tomato stew (which is like a spicy bisque with squid) and the scallopini (unbranded) with a wonderful sauce and pancetta. I accompanied it with a delicious red wine that was similar to a Primitivo (glass, $15). The total for the dinner was around $65 per person with a shared appetizer. \n\nOur server was very hospitable and accommodating, and perfectly attentive. The food was served at a nice pace. My only recommendation would be that they provide bowls for sharing the stew -- we were given plates to share the soup, and it was difficult to enjoy the deliciousness from a plate. \n\nIt is difficult to find these hidden gems in San Francisco, and I'm glad that I did.

Even the presentation was so appealing... light and perfect for an appetizer. I recommend dipping your bread in the extra oil on the plate :)\nx Spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga (Fresh Spaghetti Spicy Garlic Oil Salt Cured Fish Roe) - The pasta was perfectly cooked and the slight saltiness of the cured fish roe really made the dish. Usually, fish roe could be overpowering, but it was perfectly done. I believe this is one of their speciality pastas so DEF recommend.\nx Uni Pasta - This was their special of the night which we did not order, but kept anyway. We wanted the sea urchin pasta with shaved tuna hearts, but the server misunderstood us so we agreed to keep it if she added shaved tuna hearts. Best decision ever! This pasta was so rich, creamy, and delicious. AMAZINGGGGG.

It was a great place to spend a chilly fall evening. \n\nThe most memorable part of the meal for me was the pasta! I had the special, which was pappardelle with seafood ragu, and omg it was so good. The sauce was flavorful, rich and comforting and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The portion was just right, too; from previous reviews I was worried, but I was completely satisfied and I'm not a light eater. You can buy a pound of the pasta to cook at home too!\n\nOur server was accommodating when we wanted to split the bill with exact amounts on each card (although he made a quiet remark that indicated he wasn't thrilled about it). The service was good overall though, they are very helpful and make an effort to create an upscale feeling experience. The meal didn't break the bank either -- a glass of wine, pasta and shared appetizer + dessert were about $50/pp.", "author": "Christine G."}

Lorella, manager and one of the owners, told me yes it was first come first served and asked me how many. I told her two people and she said yes, there was bar seating available. \n\nWhen I got there, I asked if we could just grab whichever seats at the bar, nothing that there were place settings on one leg of the bar. Lorella recognized my voice and said you just called right? I saved you these two seats. How thoughtful! Dinner is already off to a great start. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\nEverything was amazing! We went to Italy over the summer so I had a craving for good Italian seafood. We were not disappointed. We got the spicy baby octopus, fresh spot prawns, spicy garlic oil cod roe pasta, and the macaroni tomato uni pasta. Everything was exceptionally prepared and fresh. \n\nThe baby octopus was so tender and I was so happy that the dish, because of the deep bowl, stayed hot the entire time, down to the last spoonful. \n\nThe prawns were so tender, sweet and fresh. \nThe cod roe pasta reminded us of Rome, pasta cooked al dente. \n\nThe uni pasta with the tomato sauce was perfect! I love uni but typically do not like uni pasta because I find it too rich. The preparation here with a tomato based sauce was perfectly balanced. It was excellent and left a lingering uni taste. \n\nSERVICE:\nExcellent service! See my comments under arrival. \n\nAMBIENCE:\nNice for a date night, noise level okay/ambient\n\nOVERALL:\nI wished I lived in SF just so I could come here weekly!

Sardinia is a remarkable place from its rugged inner terrain where millions of sheep graze to the hundreds of beaches that circle the island like a pearl necklace that attract both Italian and international visitors on holiday. \n\nIts people are unique within Italy - a truly separate breed living on an island whose southern tip is closer to Tunisia than the rest of the country (natives refer to the rest of Italy as \"The Continent.\"). As with any distinct culture Sardinia has its own cuisine and at last count there were 8 Sardinian restaurants in the US - 2 in NYC and 1 each in Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Miami, Washington, DC and San Francisco. \n\nLa Ciccia in San Francisco's Noe Valley district is as close as you can get to savoring authentic dishes without traveling there. It took me a while to finally eat there because it is basically always booked until around 9:30 and closes at 10 (its regular appearance on top-10 lists of the best restaurants in San Francisco - including a the latest published by Open Table - is one of the reasons). Of course dining at 9:45 pm is normal in Mediterranean lands but I live about 20 miles south of the city and would rather not get home after midnight. But I'd made the decision to take what I could get and landed a table at that time. I was not disappointed and it was worth the wait.\n\nThe husband and wife team of chef Massimilliano Conti (he's the Sard) and Lorella Degan have created a spot that - were it not for the street car running on tracks nearby - would hold its own on the restaurant row on Via Sardegna in Cagliari's Marina District. Knowing I wouldn't finish everything but that I could take what I didn't finish home, I cerated my own tasting menu and when I closed my eyes and savored the flavors of various dishes was transported to a place I consider my second home.\n\nI was offered an amuse bouche of a few strips of bottarga - the compressed mullet roe that is one of Sardinia's staples -mand ordered a plate of the crisp flatbread affectionately referred to as \"sheet music\" which was served warm, drizzled with olive oil and had a few rosemary leaves that added a subtle fragrance. \n\nFor an appetizer I order the octopus stew in a spicy tomato sauce that has been cited repeatedly as a favorite by web reviewers and it lived up to its reputation. Then half portions of both spaghetti with bottarga and fregola (little pearls of pasta that) with a seafood sauce. The spaghetti dish was different than any other of the literally hundred times I've had it and I was told it was because they use fresh rather than dry pasta. So a first for me. Then I devoured grilled squid and grilled jumbo prawns - both fresh and locally caught. Unfortunately I didn't have room for dessert.\n\nThe night I ate there the renowned Mexican chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara was dining near by with friends visiting from out of town. I can rave all day and all night about a restaurant but there's no better tribute than being a place where a city's other acclaimed chefs come to eat on their rare nights off. I plan to return as soon as possible!", "author": "Mitchell F."}

She helped us with the wine pairing as well and the wines paired perfectly with our meals.  We were in absolute awe of the place.\n\nTo start, my husband ordered the Prupisceddu in Umidu cun Tomatiga (Baby Octopus stew in a spicy Tomato Sauce)  and I ordered the Zupetta de Pisci (Seafood Stew of Clams Mussels Shrimps Calamari Sea Greens). Both were hearty and a perfect start to our meal, especially since it was a pretty cold night. \n\nThen for our first course, my husband orderd the  Spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga (Fresh Spaghetti Spicy Garlic Oil Salt Cured Fish Roe) and I ordered the Pasta Longa cun su Nieddu de Seppia (Fresh Linguine Seafood Sugo Lemon Zest Squid Ink). If I recall correctly, I think the pasta is made in house.  For our main course, my husband ordered the Pisci de Mari Arrustiu (Seared Market Fish and Vegetables)  which he loved and I had the \nGamberoisi Arrustiusu cun Tomatiga (Seared Prawns on a Rich Tomato Sugo). The prawns were huge and cooked to perfection! \n\nDefinitely a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back sometime.

We ordered the stewed octopus with the spicy tomato sauce - the octopus was really soft and the sauce was really good - I used some of the bread to get the sauce up.  We then had the signature dish of the restaurant - the fresh spaghetti with spicy garlic oil and salt cured fish roe - I liked the dish but thought that it needed a touch more salt.  We then had the special fish of the day - the branzino with tomato sauce and olives and the fish was done very well - it came with braised cabbage.  The last dish we shared was the pork scaloppine with mushrooms. The pork dish was nice and crispy but we were so stuffed, we took the rest of it home.

Every dish that we ordered was spectacular and did not disappoint. The restaurant is extremely small and crowded, and you have to get a reservation. Reservations are usually made a month in advance so I'd start planning if you want to dine here.\n\nAll of the dishes are small enough that I'd recommend sharing everything so you get to try multiple things. We started with the Prupisceddu in Umidu cun Tomatiga (Baby octopus in a spicy tomato sauce). There was a good amount of octopus and I loved the tomato sauce. It wasn't spicy at all and had a really hearty taste. A little tip would be to dip the house bread in the sauce!\n\nFor our pasta dishes, we opted for the Pasta Longa cun su Nieddu de Seppia (Linguine seafood sugo with lemon zest squid ink) and the Malloreddus a sa Campidanese (Gnochetti Pork Bagna Pecorino Sardo). Both were FANTASTIC!! Both pastas were cooked perfectly al-dente and I loved how chewy the pastas were. The linguine seafood was packed with this savory flavor that had a hint of sweetness from the lemon zest. I love squid ink pastas and this one was top-notch. The gnochetti was amazing as well. I loved the texture of the pasta and you could definitely tell that the pastas have a real homemade feel to them. \n\nWe were still feeling a little hungry so we decided to order the Gamberoisi Arrustiusu cun Tomatiga (Seared Prawns).

Additionally the servers did not appear to be that knowledgeable about the wine selection to effectively make recommendations. On the other hand the pasta was very well cooked to a nice al dente texture.\n\nBaby octopus stew - get this. The octopus is very tender in a spicy tomato broth \n\nPasta with uni and shaved tuna hearts - this dish came out smelling very fishy and on top of that had an offensive fishy taste as well. I've had uni sashimi before and it's never smelled or tasted fishy so I wasn't sure if it was the uni or the tuna hearts or both that was causing the offensive smell and taste. \n\nPasta with fish roe - this also came out smelling very fishy too but the taste wasn't as bad but was still not very exciting.

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 are because of the service and the bread. Our waiters were okay, a bit impatient and unfriendly. The bread tasted stale.\n\nAnyway, for food, we did a family style and we ordered 6 dishes in total. \n1. Anchovy salad (4.5/5): I'm not a big fan of anchovy because I find them to be a bit too fishy. But my friends all loved it. I like the citrus they put in to go with the salty fish. \n2. Tomato based soup with baby octopus (5/5): love this appetizer and after we finished the octopus, we dipped our bread in, and it was delicious (wish the bread could be fresher)\n3. Sea urchin pasta with shredded salmon heart (5/5): love this creamy (creamy because of the sea urchin). Really creative and flavorful .\n4. Linguini with black squid ink (5/5): whenever I go to an Italian restaurant, squid ink pasta is a must. La Ciccia did a great a job making this dish. The linguini was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing.\n5. Shrimp with saut\u00e9 peppers (entree) (4/5): the shrimps were huge. Not my favorite because the taste was kinda bland and nothing too much going on with this dish.\n6. Marinated Lamb steak with Brussels sprouts (5/5): LOVE LOVE LOVE this lamb.

There was nothing wrong with La Ciccia but perhaps my expectations were too high, or maybe we ordered poorly since having three tomato sauce based dishes became a little tiring.\n\nWe started with the baby octopus stew -- the octopus was tender but didn't have much flavor.  The stew had nice concentration of flavors but was heavy on the tomato paste.   Nice light touch of spice.  3.5/5\n\nI ordered the Malloreddus a sa Campidanese, which is mealworm-shaped seminola pasta in a pork ragu sauce.  The sauce tasted like a weaker version of the octopus stew but with tender chunks of ground pork.  3.5/5\n\nThe husband ordered one of the daily specials:   Fettuccine with crab and sea bass.  Again a tomato based sauce but lighter and sweeter from the seafood.  4/5\n\nFor dessert we had the gelato:  a trio of one small scoop each of Marsala raisin (hubs thought it reminded him of rum raisin ice cream), chocolate pistachio and goat cheese with figs.   Interesting flavors -- I didn't enjoy them all but appreciated the uniqueness.  4/5\n\nService was cordial with a strong wine selection.

Bonus points for having a Bernal/South Mission pad is being able to have dinner at popular places without the wait :P I called in around 5PM and was able to get a reservation for 8:45PM (they also had other openings on OpenTable but it's easier to just call). \nThroughout the night, the restaurant was 95% full with no wait at the door. You'd probably score a walk-in as well. \n\nWe unknowingly ordered two pasta dishes from the First Course section of the menu, thinking one would be protein and one would be pasta/carbs. They ended up both being pastas but we finished both down to the last drop of the sauces.\n\nPasta #1 (Squid Ink) 5 stars\nPasta #2 (Sea Urchin) 4.5 stars\nGelato as dessert 5 stars and above **\n\n\nMy recollection of the dish name: \nSquid Ink Linguine \n\nMenu Title:  \nPasta Longa cun su Nieddu de Seppia (Fresh Linguine Seafood Sugo Lemon Zest Squid Ink) - $23\n\nThe menu names were a little hard haha. But this dish was a solid 5 stars. The most delicious squid ink pasta I've had. The fresh linguine hugs the sauce so well, and they were not stingy about the sauce either - we had a little bit of leftover to wipe down with the breads. The dish overall was savory but not too salty, rich but not overwhelming. The lemon zest brings sooo much to the plate, waking up my taste buds every time.\n- note: complimentary bread was kind of bland though.\nI'd definitely recommend this dish, and it's easily shareable!\n\n\nMy recollection of the dish name:\nBig couscous like pasta with uni, pancetta and tuna heart\n\nMenu Title:\nFregua cun Arrizzoni e Cori de Tonnu (Sardinian Fregula Sea Urchin Tomato Shaved Tuna Heart) - $21\n\nOK. Saw \"sea urchin\". Saw \"tuna\". We were like yes we want this one. hahaha us noobs had no idea what the dish was, and we were a little intimidated to ask the waitress. Anyways.. thank goodness La Ciccia makes everything delicious cuz we fell in love at first bite. This dish was probably a 4.5/5 for us, since it got a little too rich at the end. If we weren't sharing, or if we had ordered any other dish, we wouldn't have been able to finish this.\n\nWhat did it taste like? Imagine uni / sea urchin pasta, where the pasta are like small pillows of porous, light dough (it's called Fregua, a Sardinian specialty pasta). Creamy, rich, packed with umami flavors from the shaved tuna heart (like a stronger version of bonito). It was quite exotic but also resonated with some Japanese/eastern flavors as well. I highly recommend this if you like sea urchin pasta.\n\n** Now.. onto dessert.\nAfter hearing the flavors available, we opted for two scoops of gelato, and man, it was the best ice cream I've ever had in my life. That's a huge statement cuz I like ice cream, but no ice cream has ever made me stop and savor the moment for it. \n\nThe goat cheese and fig gelato was such an amazing combo. Mild goat cheese aroma lingered between tiny icy bits, and small chunks of figs were soft and delicious. And the other flavor: marsala wine with rum raisins was absolutely wonderful. I can't explain enough how the alcohol was actually present in the gelato, and it was the perfect balance of lightly creamy / extremely cold, nitrogen-like ice cream. Every bite led to wide-eyed delight.\n\n.. tl;dr don't skip out on the gelato. :D'\n\nTotal was about $55 before tax for two and we didn't order alcohol.", "author": "Maggie G."}

After a broad sweep of Yelp for the best places to eat Italian food, I came across La Ciccia (technically Sardinian) as one of the mostly highly rated spots.\n\nWe made a reservation, which I would highly recommend, just seeing how busy this place gets. I arrived a bit early, so I sat at the bar, where the bartender offered me a drink. When a table opened up, the hostess started me.\n\nTo be honest, one of the main reasons I picked this place was to try the whole squid appetizer, which had been frequently posted in photos on Yelp. Sooo disappointment #1 was the fact that this was not on the menu. I was heartbroken! Oh well. Instead, we started with the Calamari Salad, which had olives, celery, and radish. This was okay. Tastes fresh, but not exactly my type of salad.\n\nNina and I decided on two main entr\u00e9es, the spaghetti with fish roe and fregula with sea urchin. I can see why this is a top place to eat seafood, but we weren't impressed by the flavors and textures of either dish. My favorite dish between the two was the fregula with sea urchin. Nina thought it was too salty, so I ended up eating most of it.\n\nWe were craving dessert this particular day, and I think if we had liked the food better, we would have stayed here, but we walked to Mitchell's instead.

Start off with the fresh burrata salad and calamaria.  My favorite pastas are the fregula sea urchin tomato shaved tuna heart and seafood linguine with squid ink.  Try their fish because it's always got a crispy skin even though everything else is moist, smooth and drooling with flavor.\n\nI could eat their bread all day even if it's not warm.  It has a crust with a soft center that makes it great to soak up the sauces from your bowls.  \n\nHowever, save room for any of their desserts.  Whether it's the refreshing ricotta with saffron cake topped with toasted almonds, trio of gelatos (e.g., black currant, wine and raisins), or abbamele (aka chilled mouse + flan), you're bound to end on a sweet note.\n\nService is impeccable.

It's small, cozy, intimate, and unassuming, and until you look at the menu, it's hard to believe that behind the thick fabric curtain guarding the entrance, friendly waiters are serving up plates of pasta topped with shaved tuna heart.\n\nFor appetizers, my table of 3 shared the seasonal burrata salad and spicy baby octopus stew. My experience with appetizers is why La Ciccia doesn't get 5 stars from me. The burrata texture felt strangely gritty and unfamiliar. The spicy baby octopus stew was pretty good, though I didn't find it as phenomenal as our waiter had suggested it should be.\n\nBut beyond appetizers, everything was delicious! We ravaged the pasta menu, choosing all but the pork pasta (and that was only because my two friends are essentially pescatarians). The uni pasta with shaved tuna heart was creamy and flavorful. I'm still not sure I can tell you what tuna heart tastes like, but the overall dish was great (though maybe a lot to handle). The spaghetti with fish roe was INCREDIBLE. The sauce was lightly spicy, incredibly delicious, and very memorable. The spaghetti was also cooked perfectly. The lemon squid ink pasta was tasty as well. The lemon worked well with the squid ink, and the pasta, fregula, was like nothing I had seen before (it was cut so small that I initially thought it was a grain).\n\nWe were so full that we were ready to pass on dessert, but our waiter had told us the honey/almond/ricotta/saffron cake is the one thing on the menu he never skips, so acknowledging that it had been so difficult to score a reservation, we decided to treat ourselves, and I'm so glad we made the right choice. It's something of an elegantly spiced and flavored custard/cake lovechild. I was too full to order anything else, but I can see this dessert working so perfectly with a hot cup of tea.\n\nLast note: Make a reservation well in advance. My friends and I had to make our reservation over a month in advance to book a reasonable meal time.", "author": "Kelly R."}

Unpretentious, inventive and authentic, you don't have to even ask what's good--everything is. Sardinian food is amazing when done right, especially if you like creative, traditional interpretations of excellent seafood.\n\nMy only problem is the wine list is so stellar, I can't pick just one bottle. Their knowledgable somm/owner patiently describes the dozen I'm lucky to narrow down to.\n\nTIP: book a resie well in advance, this place is popular. If you arrive early, check out their sister spot La Nebbia (across the street) for a quick glass of great wine.\n\nPS\u00a0 I can't help but comment on the recent review from Kindra W...really, you gave two stars for a dinner that was graciously comped which otherwise you would have slammed with the lowest rating possible? I've been coming to this place since it opened, and have had the completely opposite experience every time. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong--but so too would be Zagat (who proclaims this \"Sardinan wonder\" \"well worth getting to\"), the SF Chronicle (Bay Area's Top 100 Restaurants), Trip Advisor (with a perfect five stars) and every other notable publication to step foot inside--but I think the service is among the best. Zagat gives the food 4.8 out of 5.0 (see photo), on par with the best chefs in the world.\n\nPerhaps you put off an unfriendly vibe when unable to have one of the tables that were surely reserved at 7:30 on a Saturday?

My wife and I went there yesterday evening for our anniversary dinner, and the service was terrible. First of all, the waiter didn't bring our wine until we had already finished our appetizers. When I pointed this out to him, he \"apologized\" in a huffy manner. We ordered the squid appetizer and a couple of pasta dishes. Instead of asking us whether we wanted the pasta dishes brought simultaneously or in sequence, they simply decided on the latter. Ok fine, except that there was a 15-minute wait between when they cleared the first dish and brought the second. And then the vegetable side dish we ordered arrived after the second pasta dish. It was described as kale with anchovies but it clearly wasn't kale--chard, maybe.

My bottarga was ok but not for $23 sans meat. Pasta noodles needed another minute or so. I did appreciate the fact that it wasn't overly salty. Bottarga did carry a heavy fishy taste. If it wasn't expressed on the menu that this had uni, you'd never guess. Also sans meat and around the same price, this was incredibly disappointing considering we had a super delicious uni pasta last weekend. The uni was blended in to the red sauce hence aside from not being visible, it was overpowered by the tartness of the red sauce. Round little tapioca-like balls as the pasta of choice. It was an interesting mouth feel but did not go w/ it. Perhaps a bucatini would've been better. Still can't save it though. Well, maybe cheese but it doesn't appear that they give you any.

The vibe was perfect for both occasions, as the service is personalized, the ambiance is rustic, charming and intimate, and the food is simply to die for.  \n\nThe owners are from Sardinia (an island off the coast of Italy) and specialize in traditional Sardinian cuisine, which is in my opinion even more delicious than traditional Italian. I've never felt so much homemade love and authenticity in a restaurant before. Absolutely every single thing on the menu is simply fantastic but I recommend sticking to the classics. \n\nThe must orders are: \n1) Fresh Spaghetti Spicy Garlic Oil Salt Cured Fish Roe. Absolutely impeccable, creamy without being overly rich, and beyond flavorful from the Fish Roe. \n2) Fresh Linguine Seafood Sugo Lemon Zest Squid Ink. The perfect blend of savory dish with a tinge of sweetness. The seafood sugo is simply oozing with a magnetic seafood flavor. \n3) Baby Octopus stew in a spicy Tomato Sauce. I'll preface this by saying I don't like octopus and I almost never order it. However, my coworker convinced me to order it and I have to admit that it was one of the highlights of our dinner! The octopus meat is so tender, juicy and covered in such a hearty and homey tomato stew. \n\nIn addition, definitely check out their daily specials -- we ordered several additional pastas and a lamb dish from there and loved them as well! \n\nOur waitresses from both nights were amazing and picked out the perfect wine pairings for what we ordered. We had some Sardinian wine as well as some traditional Italian favorites and were in love with how well they paired with the appetizers and entrees. \n\nSo when you're craving an intimate dinner with a close friend or family, or are seeking the perfect date night spot in Noe Valley, look no further than La Ciccia. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Their reservation system was not working so we had to call and still had to wait for three weeks before getting a table for 5:45 p.m. The restaurant is small so I understood the difficulty in getting a reservation.\nOnce seated, we found that our table was wobbly. A nice worker tried to balance it without success so they moved an adjoining table into our space. It was also wobbly but we decided to live with it.\nWe decided to split a bowl of the baby octopus soup and it was delicious. The broth was excellent and the octopus was just a little overcooked.\nFor the main course, my partner had the prawns in a rich, tomato broth.  The prawns were huge so my partner was very happy, although he wished the prawns had been shelled.\nI had the special which was fusili cooked with proscuitto and other tasty bits of meat and fish. It was perfect, particularly with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on top.\nWe were too full for any dessert.\nI recommend this restaurant very highly for the food.

Both were good and we were enjoying our meal.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered their suckling pig special with tomato sauce. What I got was a bowl of fatty stew. Seriously- I was picking out huge pieces of fat and putting them on the side of my bowl. As the waiter had recommended this dish - I told him I wasn't pleased and he offered to take it off the bill. I maybe had 3 bites. Ok - no harm, no foul.\n\nUntil the bill came and we were charged for the dish. Thinking it must be a mistake, we reminded him that he'd said he'd remove the $30 charge. He then told us that the chef refused to take it off the bill and said he must charge us and there was nothing he could do. The chefs wife is the hostess and upon leaving she said she had to \"side with her husband\" and the waiter was out of place trying to make it right.\n\nNeedless to say we won't be returning.

It's extremely hard to get a reservation on weekends unless you pick some unfavorable time - 9:45pm in my case for both experiences. But I wouldn't mind to do a 3rd time with such time slot again because this place is just so good!\n\nFor my latest experience, my friend and I actually arrived 20 mins early but a table was saved for us already :) Seated promptly and picked a bottle of wine (huge wine list selection by the way). This place seats around 30 people, it's dim and not noisy, pretty suitable for a romantic date.\n\nLa Ciccia is generally recognized as an Italian restaurant but officially they serve Sardinian food - which means seafood-focus, and you would instantly be able to tell from their menu. The staff was very attentive, and our server did a very nice job in introducing us his recommendations.\n\n#Prupisceddu in Umidu cun Tomatiga (Octopus stew): A.\nFirst of all, this dish is spicy. However, for people that can't eat spicy I still highly recommend you to try this dish, because it's so good that you will just keep eating! Very very rich tomato-based stew, a lot of small whole octopus - try it with the free bread that they serve, this appetizer will definitely turn on your appetite.\n\n#Calamareddsu Arrustisu: A-.\nThis dish came with 6 pieces squid, I'm not sure about the cooking style but the main point here was the sauce (slightly oily) - kind of refreshing and unique at the same time. Squid was pretty fresh.\n\n#Spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga: A.\nSimply put, this is a garlic + peperoncino salt + fish roe spaghetti. Sounds like a simple spaghetti but once you have a first bite you will go nonstop. Strong garlic taste (not to a point that is bothering though), the salt definitely brought slight chilly taste to the dish, the combination was just very, very good.\n\n#Pasta cun Arrizoni e Cori de Tonnu: A.\nVery different from the spaghetti, this is an Uni-based pasta so the sauce was a lot more richer. Personally I am not a very big fan of Uni, but surprisingly I loved that Uni flavor - it didn't have that unique ocean-Uni smell/flavor, I felt like it was the texture of the sauce that Uni contributed the most. Plus this pasta was also slightly on the chilly side, the combination was just heavenly.\n\n#Gellausu Mistusu: B+.\nThree scoops of Gelato. One was cheese flavor, one was chocolate, and sorry can't remember the 3rd one. But I liked the chocolate one the best - it was actually very good. But the other two were meh.\n\n#Truta de Arrescottu: B.\nIt was basically some kind of sponge cake? However the texture was very different from the ones I usually have..... had some weird feeling after eating it. The taste was not bad, I guess I just wasn't used to the texture.\n\nOverall, I love this place very much because of all the main dishes. I don't mind repeating all these dishes again and again every week but there are quite a few more options on the menu that I haven't tried yet, I guess I will have to go back few more times!", "author": "Simon C."}

The two of us shared:\n\nTripe stew (appetizer special): extremely tender tripe cooked in a delicious, hearty, tangy tomato and pecorino cheese based sauce. While we've enjoyed better tripe elsewhere, that sauce was great - I would have been happy eating a bowl of that with pasta or bread!\n\nFettuccine in creamy tomato sauce with uni and tuna hearts: based on the components, we thought we would enjoy this dish; instead, it tasted unpleasantly disjointed and jarred. If you're craving uni-based pasta, check out SPQR instead for a great rendition!\n\nRavioli with veal and prosciutto ragu (pasta special): tasty and heavy, I enjoyed this dish but didn't find it particularly memorable. Which is a little sad, considering that you're paying $25 for ~4 raviolis.\n\nRicotta and saffron cake with honey and toasted almond: airy, moist, and not too sweet. We didn't care for this dessert.\n\nGelato: you're given a cute plate with tiny scoops of 4 different, tasty, interesting gelato flavors. We enjoyed the gelato, but thought the $9 price tag ridiculous.\n\nThe service seemed friendly but inconsistent. Our waiter would disappear for long periods of time as our water glasses sat empty, and our food came out painfully slow compared to the diners around us.", "author": "Steve L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-27", "description": "The food is just ok, a little greasy, but the menu makes an effort to be interesting with regional offers. It's probably pricey for the quality tho. \n\n(sort the reviews by date and read the review right below to understand the kind of practices of this business)\n\nA reservation had been a day earlier, we showed up on time, the place was pretty packed except for one table. I had dined there before and sort of remembered that one thing about this place is that they don't take space efficiency lightly. I have no doubt they would consider vertically stacking tables if their ceiling was higher.\n\nSo boom, we get in and my first observation is that the area we are at, near the window, is actually way more pleasant. The vibrant creativity of table arrangement in the main room undoubtedly found a bound here: geometry. It's two tables of two, period. The second thing is the lighting, much more pleasant there than in the main room.\n\nWe're about to make our order from nice table and BOSS shows up and asks if we could move to another table. It seemed nicely pulled off initially since we got cornered in like 5 seconds. BOSS talked to my date directly who perhaps, she thought, would be easier to deal with than I. Textbook case of leveraging the expectation that most people have a difficult relationship with the word 'no'. BOSS's handling of the situation is impressive at first. In fact, she knows full well we obviously don't want to go in the middle of the cave, but her targeting is perfect since in like 2 seconds, I'm basically having to chose between 'yes' and looking like an asshole to my date as well as engaging in a conflict with a person with access clearance to the kitchen where food I am going to eat will be prepared.\n\nBOSS knows people generally fear conflict and we do in fact not event just accept, but attempt to pretend it's ok. It's just a bit awkward as something fishy is almost palpable. At this point, for some reason, BOSS decides to provide some arguments. It initially consisted in a confusing sequences of words making little sense, eventually snowballing in some kind of BS that even herself seemed to be embarrassed about.\n\nTo give you an idea, at this point we are in this area of 2 tables of 2, the couple next to us still has a significant amount of liquid in their bottle, but BOSS is telling us that she needs our space, that's why we have to move to table of 4 in the main room (cave). BOSS is now in a bad place, angered by the possibility that despite being dumb, we might be able to do the math about her space plan, and perhaps we might potentially feel that our intelligence is being insulted. BOSS knows that 4 people will eventually be pissed, either now and at the same time, if she comes clean by admitting the plan also includes kicking out the couple next to us, with a risk of a scene in the restaurant, or 2 now, and the 2 other later, but on their way home, it's easier.\n\nThe thing BOSS doesn't realize is that the picture has been crystal clear since the beginning. It's not like it didn't notice when FRIEND entered the restaurant, he's apparently an acquaintance given the way he greeted the staff. The place is basically a cave but nice area has a window that I am facing, and during BOSS's performance, I could see FRIEND and his buddies waiting outside, and I knew full well he was going to dine in nice area. BOSS was only making the whole thing more embarrassing that it needed to be.\n\nAnd this is exactly what happened. Nice area was cleaned up for FRIEND and buddies, the two tables were sandwiched in one, group of 5 party started. Over the next hour, from the cave I could see STAFF and BOSS drop by the table to greet FRIEND. I noticed how increasingly louder it was getting, I would bet the tab ended up with many orders from the back side of the menu, which could be evidence of a second, more basic incentive for this very low class move.\n\nJust a pathetic circus.", "author": "Ho N."}

Started with a special that was off the menu. Tripe in a tomato based sauce. It was excellent! The tripe was nice and tender. The sauce had a spicy kick to it which was nice. We then moved into the Prupisceddu in Umidu cun Tomatiga ( Baby octopus in spicy tomato sauce). The octopus was tender. Sauce wasn't spicy to me. Not a bad dish though. We then moved onto the Spaggittusu cun Ally Ollu e Bottariga ( Fresh spaghetti spicy garlic oil salt cured fish roe). For me this was a very nice dish. Interesting. The flavors of the roe and garlic went well together. We then had the Pisci de Mari Arristiu ( Market fish and Veggies) . The fish was a light white. Saut\u00e9ed with veggies and cooked to perfection. And lastly dessert. Gellausu Mistusu ( gelati). I felt the gelati was more like ice cream. Very creamy. We had 3 flavors-goat cheese and fig- okay I did not like this one. It tastes like goat cheese. Just cold and in gelati form. Honestly goat cheese is my favorite, but I'm not a big fan of it in gelati form. The next was hazelnut and The last was Marsala wine and raisins. These 2 were not bad. Oh and I can't read , but the menu does state no cameras to be used at the table. I didn't see this until it was too late. I guess my eyes just go straight to the food :)", "author": "Angela M."}

For now, enjoy life and eat pasta.\" That's what our server told us yesterday at dinner when one of my dining companions beamed that the food was so good he was getting so fat. Been here a few times now, and La Ciccia has never disappoints. The only restaurant I've experienced with such authentic Italian (and in this case Sardinian) feel is Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles. But La Ciccia takes it even one step further. They don't mess around, and you want to abide by their rules (cuz the food is so darn good). There's a fair warning at the top of the menu to not use your cell phone or computers. Apart from that, the hospitality is as warming as the plates of food served. Each time I come here, I see diners coming by and giving the owner (manager?) a hug -- regulars in the neighborhood, I presume. Last night, we had the anchovies, baby octopus stew, and grilled calamari for appetizers. If you are open to anchovies, I would highly recommend this dish. It's very bright flavors and not as fishy as you'd think. They plop a basket of bread and no butter or oil down on the table for you, and usually you wonder what it's for, until you see the baby octopus stew arrive. The tomato sauce of this stew is so flavorful -- spicy, tangy, delicious. I love grilled calamari, and this was perfectly sized squid, grilled and sauced with an olive oil-based sauce. I also had the arugula salad with burrata that was more butter than cheese (= sinfully delicious). My favorite dish here is the fresh spagetthi with bottarga -- cured fish roe. It's not as heavy as one would think, and like all their pasta, the spagetti is perfectly al dente. \n\nCome here if you want to have juicy, uninterrupted conversation over good wine (the list is HUGE) and unbelievable pasta.", "author": "Taya V."}

There -- I've provided you with the go-to items to order! \n\nThe roasted Monterey calamari nails down the texture and the taste. I love the basil olive oil they put on top. It's light and flavorful. Definitely get it when it's on the menu. \n\nThe baby octopus stew is tomato-based with a kick, so foodies with heartburn take note! If you haven't overloaded yourself with the bread, be sure to use it to finish off your stew. \n\nThe salted roe spaghetti is the love of my life. Don't fret about the \"spicy\" garlic oil. It's hardly spicy and I'm very sensitive to spiciness. My spaghetti was cooked al dente (which I love), but for those who don't, it's something to keep in mind. This is a much lighter pasta. \n\nA heavier, yet equally delicious alternative is the sea urchin + tuna heart pasta. The sauce is created with tomato and sea urchin, while the pieces of tuna heart are garnished on top and mix into the sauce nicely. It's a more flavorful dish, so for those who like dishes that tickle the taste buds, don't miss out on the sea urchin + tuna heart pasta. Lately, I've had it with fettuccine, but they've used other types of pasta in the past. \n\nAffordability: With tip and feeling extremely full after ordering a good amount of food, I spend approximately $130 for 2 people.

You will be missing out if you don't get it. I know many rave about the baby octopus stew, but it fell a little short for me. While flavorful, was a tad too sweet and not savory or thick enough. The Sardinian flat bread was delish! I really enjoyed the fresh rosemary on it. \n\nand moved on to: \n\nPezza de (insert Italian word for steak) a sa Saba (Seared Filet Mingon Tenderloin Tagliata drizzled with Saba)\nPisci de Mari Arrustiu (Seared Market Fish and Vegetables) \n\nThe fish of the day was branzino. It was prepared so delicately it literally just flaked. Lots of well rounded flavors. The steak was melt in your mouth delicious and the winner of the two. The way they cooked down the balsamic drew out such complex flavors, I really enjoyed it. Absolutely delicious.\n\nthen finished up with: \n\nTruta de Arrescottu (Sardinian Ricotta and Saffron Cake Honey and Toasted Almond)\nGellausu Mistusu (Assorted Artisanal Gelati)\n\nThe cake isn't an actual \"cake\" as we know in America. It's more just lovely ricotta. The flavors were good, just not what I was expecting. However, the toasted almonds on top gave it the perfect nutty flavor and best crunch. The gelato came as a flight of three. The marsala raisin, fig goat cheese, and chocolate hazlenut were all delicious but the marsala raisin was my favorite. \n\nNo pictures because the menu asked for no photographs to be taken (it was so hard not to want to photograph beautiful food!) and will just have to live in my head.\n\n4.5 stars and will probably be back!", "author": "Shereen A."}

You're perhaps one foot at most from the next table. The space is small and since it is so popular, it feels confining. The service was standard; our waiter friendly, so no problems there. Now to the food, the reason we all go out is to eat. There was one stand out dish. The octopus in a spicy tomato sauce. It was so good with the bread, A perfect appetizer which could stand alone as a main. All other dishes did not impress. Lamb tenderloin, while good, was not great. Fish with olive tapenade tasted like something Blue Apron would send and you could whip up in a flash. We didn't get any pasta and think that perhaps that was what we should have had.

Our server was very friendly and helped us select a nice Sardinian wine to accompany our various dishes. We started with the white anchovies, calamari salad and marinated olives, and a small basket with slices of homemade Italian bread.  All were delicious, especially the mild white anchovies!  Next, we had the malloreddus (rich and a generous portion), the prawns (also a good portion), and the fish of the day, branzino, split and boned, topped with a sort of tomato sugo and sliced toasted almonds, served over a bed of agrodolce raisins, celery and onions.  We split the ricotta cake, light and fluffy, not too sweet and several dessert wines.  All in all, an excellent meal, this place is a keeper!

There are no bad dishes in this restaurant. I always bring a few friends and order my favorites dishes plus one or two special of the day. My favorites: Octopus stew, Fregula with urchin tomato sauce topped with shaved cured tuna heart, and Spaghetti with garlic oil and topped with shaved Bottarga. Sardegna is an island so you'll find the menu to be very seafood-centric, however, the lamb tenderloin is fantastic if you crave something other than seafood. Pro-tip: Corkage is $35 per 750ml, 2 bottle limit per table. However, they will waive one corkage for every bottle purchased from their list.

I'm guessing it was made in-house because the linguine was a little uneven - I love these imperfections - and the texture was a great balance between soft & being al dente. The meat sauce was crazy delicious.\n\nMAIN COURSES\n* Pezza de angioni a sa saba (seared lamb tenderloin tagliata drizzled w/ saba, $27) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-ciccia-san-francisco?select=K6uFe-Qvb1eYdwWHNEWoXg#K6uFe-Qvb1eYdwWHNEWoXg\nOverall, everyone's favorite dish.

Burrata as always was delicious, but this is something you could have all over the city.  The seafood stew was incredible.  Generous amount of creatures inside.  The broth was delicious and smooth on its own without feeling heavy; it's the tastiest seafood soup I've had.\n\nMy favorite item here was the sea urchin pasta with shaved tuna heart.  It's perfection, and the only way I've enjoyed sea urchin.  We also tried the pasta special of the day- if I recall correctly this was fettuccine with veal and lamb.\n\nFor main courses, we tried the lamb tenderloin and the pork loin.  The pork had some sort of breading on it, and was served in a rich sauce.  I loved it, but beginning to fill up I had to move onto the lamb after a few bites.  The lamb was impressive- it almost melted in my mouth.  So tender, cooked to pink perfection, served with a bit of sweet balsamic.\n\nI'll definitely be back here, it's the best around.

I went with my girlfriend and we decided on this spot as our first place to try without our boyfriends who do not like seafood. This would be our first weekly outing so far.\nWe arrived and were shuffled to a tiny table by the door. Stuffed in like sardines. The place was not cozy or cool . Terrible art.\nWe had 3 different waiters and the last woman was downright rude. \nThe appetizers were underwhelming , and the main courses were as well.

Therefore, after two years of being on the outside looking in, a foodie friend and I decided to just show up without a reservation on a Friday evening for the coveted bar seats.  Alas, a dash of patience and a mere 30 minutes later, we were seated for our seafood feast.\n\nWe started with the oven roasted calamari in basil oil.  It was tender, served on a bed of arugula and just enough to whet my appetite for the sea bream with olives and spinach.  The sea bream was filleted, boneless, and roasted to perfection.  After eating extremely well (in terms of taste and health), we finished with the ricotta and saffron cake with honey and almonds.    I usually head straight for anything with chocolate, but I'm glad my friend talked me into trying something different.  The ricotta/ saffron cake was light, fluffy, and not overly sweet.   Such an amazing meal, and surprisingly affordable.  And in SF too! Who knew?  Apparently, everyone who booked up all those reservations so that we were never able to get anything earlier than a 10pm booking, that's who. \n\nP.S. If you're partial to reds like me, the bovale is a light red that goes very well with seafood.  \n\nP.P.S.  Sardinian food is amazing with all the fresh seafood and vegetables.

They were cooked in a garlic sauce topped with a pepperoncino sauce which gave it a nice little kick. My boyfriend usually doesn't like shrimp heads, but he was going to town on these little heads.

Nestled in Noe Valley, La Ciccia is a small, quaint Sardinian restaurant with a nicely curated menu w/ an emphasis in seafood.\n\n++Ambiance \nIntimate setting with dim lighting, modest decor and tight seating. Restaurant is pretty small and likely ideal for dates or small parties of 4. I was a little bothersome with our table as I felt like it was in the middle of the hallway where everyone passes by, but was quickly forgiving as our host & server were both very attentive and accommodating. Although it was a full house, it wasn't loud and my boyfriend and I were able to pleasantly have conversations without any problems. \n\nJust a tip: I would try to get the counter seating if you're on a date as it looked a lot cozier and intimate!  \n\n++Food \nThe arugula salad with fresh mozzarella was surprisingly delicious for such a simple salad and we honestly just ordered it to have some greens in our dinner. Now moving onto the good stuff... There are 2 different stew appetizers on the menu and although we heard about their baby octopus stew before, we instead decided to go with the assorted seafood stew (clams, mussels, shrimp & calamari) w/ sea greens and boy it did not disappoint! This was definitely my favorite dish of the night as the broth was amazing and the sea greens added a nice complimentary touch to the rest of the seafood! Think a lighter, slightly creamier and elevated version of a cioppino - mmmm yum. \n\nFor our main entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to stick with pastas and so we ordered the fish roe pasta and uni fettucine in tomato sauce with tuna hearts. I was a teeny bit disappointed in the latter as I was hoping it would have more uni. Bummer, but still good and preferable over the fish roe pasta in my opinion. Both pastas, however, were cooked perfectly al dente.\n\n++Wine\nThere is quite an extensive wine list and the servers were more than happy to help suggest suitable pairings for your dish. Also, just FYI I think the corkage fee was $35 for 2 bottles.\n\nOverall, my experience was pleasant and I would definitely come back to try their baby octopus stew and other main entrees.

So we compromised and ordered:\n\n   * Pani Guttiau ($7 side order) - a nice crisp flatbread with rosemary and pecorino cheese, way more exciting than the complimentary bread they bring to the table\n\n   * Octopus stew in a spicy tomato sauce ($14 appetizer) - very tender baby octopus in a thick tomato sauce, I thought it was really good, hubby thought it was okay but too \"fishy\" though he gamely ate some, complimentary bread is good for sopping up all that sauce\n\nI could have just stopped my meal there. Even though they list all these courses on the menu, this isn't one of those restaurants where you're expected to order from each course and therefore each course is tiny. The dishes here are hearty. The flat bread must have had 7-8 pieces. The octopus comes in a bowl that's definitely meant to be shared. But then we went on and got:\n\n   * Semolina Gnochetti with Pork meats Sugo and 12 Months Pecorino ($18 first course) - which was normal pasta (not gnocchi) with ground/crumbled meat sauce, very good, average portion, could have been eaten on it's own though we shared it\n\nI really wanted to get the spaghetti with bottarga but when hubby read it was salted fish roe he put his foot down. The gnochetti were still good but the spaghetti is typically Sardinian. At this point we definitely should have stopped but it was too late because we also ordered:\n\n   * Pan roasted Pork loin w/ cauliflower ($26 main course) - the low point of the meal, nothing wrong, just nothing exciting, would skip the main courses next time\n\nWe also split a Sardinian beer for $18. They do have peroni for $5 but it's not on the menu. \n\nBecause hubby doesn't like seafood he'd only give this place 3 stars. We agreed the pani and gnochetti were good.

Service was warm and professional, very welcoming.  The space was dimly-lit and cozy, but also bustling with some energy.  \n\nThe food, all of it, was spectacular.

There's the husband cooking up a storm in the back, and his sweet wife charming guests in the front. \n\nSummary: Real fresh seafood and clean flavors that compliment the ingredients without overpowering them. \n\nThe lamb was also to die for and tasted of rosemary. Definitely the most surprising meat dish I've tasted in a while. \n\nThe spaghetti was highly addictive. I could probably down a good 5 plates of that before I keel over and die happy. \n\nThe prawn dish was also really good and had a fresh tomato flavor. I bet the sauce was just so irresistible that the prawns just jumped in the sauce themselves!\n\nBasically this is the kind of food that you crave, attempt to make, and fail miserably at. The success of this food is in it's perfect simplicity and probably recipes that have been passed down for generations with a touch of genius from the chef. \n\nLast but not least, we had the lemon ricotta cake with toasted almonds and honey. I've been dreaming about it ever since I left and I will no doubt be back very soon for more good home cooking.\n\nAs a side note, the restaurant has a pretty incredible wine list (I wish I knew enough about wine to truly appreciate it!) and they've received awards for it. If you are a wino, this place definitely deserves a try. Then again, if you're a wino, you've probably already been here. \n\nThe point is, go to La Ciccia on your next date night and you'll be treated to first class food and hospitality.", "author": "Heather T."}

He also gracefully split our dishes for us at the table which was a really elegant and unexpected touch. \n\nSpecial prawn appetizer - 3/5. Actually, this was pretty over priced. The flavors were fantastic, the plating beautiful and they cooked the prawns perfectly but there were only three for $16.\n\nThe pasta with roe - 4/5. Pasta was al dente, had a hint of saltiness that really complemented the richness of the sauce. I would get this again. \n\nSea bass special - 4/5. Very simply seared sea bass, but cooked to perfection. Definitely fresh and was tender. The olive tapenade went great with it. The braised kale that came with it was fine but I would have preferred something else less bitter. \n\nOverall, a very satisfying dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-28", "description": "Very solid, well-prepared food, in a cute and intimate setting.  The dishes are very thoughtfully put together and, even though I don't know a thing about Sardinian food, I felt like the chefs were staying very true to Sardinian food culture.  \n\nMy friend and I came here around 6pm on a Tuesday, and the place quickly filled up.  Says a lot for how popular this place is.  We ordered the flatbread, the octopus stew, the prawns, the spaghetti, and the gelato trio and ricotta cake for dessert.  \n\nEach dish was excellently prepared.  My breakdown of each dish:\n\n+ Flatbread: so, this was a surprise to me.  It's not at all like what I imagined it.  It's not like American flatbread.  It's this paper-thin, almost crepe-like consistency.  There was pecorino on it, but the flavor was ever so subtle.  It was fun to eat, and a good vehicle to put the octopus stew on, but otherwise, it didn't blow my mind.\n\n+ Octopus stew:  this was my favorite dish of the night.  Generous portions of octopi, and that stew was hearty, spicy, tomato-y.  Warm, hearty goodness.  You should put some stew on your flatbread, or on the free bread that comes at the beginning of your meal.  Or dip the bread in the stew.  Highly recommended.\n\n+ Prawns: so, this was an entree, but the awesome waitress allowed us to get just a half-order as an appetizer.  It tasted very fresh and light.  \n\n+ Spaghetti: Man, this was REALLY interesting!  Not at ALL like what you'd expect from the name \"spaghetti.\"  There was this thinly shaved powder all over the dish that I think was cured roe, and the dish had this wonderfully unique and almost bitter kind of taste!  Very subtle bitterness, though.  VERY interesting, but in a good way!\n\n+ Gelato: Do get! The three flavors tonight were goat cheese + fig, chocolate hazelnut, and marsala wine.  The first and third were AWESOME!\n\n+ Ricotta cake:  pretty good, but I could've done without.\n\nEven though I didn't love every single dish, I still recognized that each dish was so very thoughtfully prepared and cooked well.  They really know what they're doing.\n\nAlso, the service was so great.  Our waitress was super helpful, and she even let us cancel an order in the middle of the meal after we realized we were too full to eat it.  \n\nI so want to give this place 5 stars, except that I wasn't blown away by the food.  However, that said, this was a wonderful, new experience, and I'm glad I got to try all these interesting foods that I've never tried before.  And I can't help but feel like I got a really great, authentic introduction to Sardinian food.  \n\nOne last note, this place tends to fill up quickly and is quite popular, as shown by the fact that it was full on a Tuesday at 6pm.  Come early or make reservations.  Also, it's good for small groups or intimate dates.", "author": "Vivian C."}

No problem, we tried something else that night.\n\nA few weeks later, I stopped by with my mum for a very early dinner. We were seated immediately. Must've been a slow night. That, or they liked my mum. (I'm banking on the latter.)\n\nThe menu's pretty clear about setting aside phones, so I didn't snap any photos. There are loads on Yelp, so I'll just refer to them:\n\n+Spaghetti with bottarga (thanks, Andy W. for this shot: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-ciccia-san-francisco?select=V2Ti927FbBeSYmbC5LWbgw#G5hn2kKQDB669EOmvfhBAQ). Bottarga's essentially salted, cured fish roe (fish eggs) which is then grated onto the pasta. The dish was salty and oily, but not overpoweringly so; I mean, I ate the whole thing.\n\n+Mama got the fish of the day, which was striped jack, served over a bed of whatever vegetables the chef decides that day. Apparently, he was in the broccoli and golden raisins mood, among with a medley of other indiscernible foodstuffs. It was pretty good.\n\nWine was... just OK. Since their wine-by-the-glass menu's scant, we had to make do. (Ugh, \"make do,\" I sound like such a snob.) I wasn't a huge fan of the red, nor the white that mum had ordered.\n\nChef Massimiliano Conti must've been the one to let us in as he took to my mum immediately and brought over some excellent baby octopus stew (served in a spicy tomato broth, great shot Kai Y.: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-ciccia-san-francisco?select=V2Ti927FbBeSYmbC5LWbgw#-VaarFekOAL4Mrmj1Mc-UQ). I'm kidding, I know he's married, but still, it was very kind of him. That broth, though! I could've sopped it up with bread forever. Speaking of bread, it's complimentary, but served cold and without butter or olive oil. Not what I expected from an Italian joint, but it is what it is.\n\nDecent service though fairly pricey.

I had the salmon as my entree but I only got through some of it as I was getting full and we wanted to save some room of dessert.

The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. I got recommended a very tasty Sardinian wine go go along with our choice of dishes. The timing of when the dishes came out was perfect. \n\nWe started with a generous serving of prosciutto. The flavors were subtle and it was sliced so thin it simply melted in your mouth. We then tried the octopus in tomato sauce. The sauce was a little spicy and rich with seafood flavor; the plate was left clean as the sauce begged to be soaked up with bread. \n\nWe then tried the very traditional spaghetti bottarga and the fettuccine with ragu. Both dishes were made with homemade pasta cooked al dente. The ragu was good, but the duck gizzard in it added texture more than flavor. \n\nI really recommend you try their daily pizza. That day it was a white pizza with zucchini blossoms, ricotta, and salami. It was great. It had amazing ingredients and amazing dough. \n\nWe ended dinner with a main course of prawns.

The spaghetti with bottarga ($17) was to die for. I don't think I ever had pasta cooked this perfectly before. It was truly al dente and simply delicious.

Don't pick the most expensive one thinking that is going to be the best because more often than not isn't what you want and you overspent for your dinner -  leaving wine a vicious cycle of negative emotion. \n\nIt has been my experience Bay Area Italian and French restaurant servers are adept at steering you in the right direction to a bottle that you will enjoy based at the price point you say you want to pay. Ask for help, tell them what tastes you enjoy about wine and the price you want to pay...there is no judgement, they want you to drink wine with your dinner!  We had an excellent recommendation and left that bottle bone dry. ::sigh:: It was so good! I was happy to avoid my usual Italian picks - Barolo or Sangiovese. \n\nWe enjoyed the smoked prosciutto and balsamic vinegar special of the day.

The spicy tomato sauce for the base of this broth was not too spicy, but definitely had a little kick to it. Okay maybe not a kick. Like a bunt to it. The octopus was amazingly tender. No rubbery chewiness here. I had just come from getting a temporary crown at the dentist and the Novocaine just wore off. Still, my jaw was a tad sore but I had no problems eating this. THAT is how tender the octopus was. I would come here again and again just for this dish alone. \n\nSardella a Schiscionera  $10  (Fresh Sardines Sauteed in EVOO, Garlic, Parsley and Bread Crumbs) - I'm a fan of sardines. I especially love it when they're in season and eating it sashimi or nigiri style. This was just ... okay. Nothing spectacular. You can skip this \n\nSpaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga $17  (Fresh Spaghetti with spicy Oil and Bottarga) - They definitely do al dente at La Ciccia. Although this spaghetti was spicy and plentiful with the bottarga (fish eggs), I preferred the fusili more. That was the true star.\n\nPasta Cruzza cun Arrizzonisi e Cori de Tonnu $17  (Fresh Fusilli with Sea Urchin Tomato and Cured Tuna Heart) - Ahhhh ... I can't decide if this was the best part of my meal OR the dessert. It's a toss up between the two. I loved this dish. If you are a sea urchin lover, this is for you. The sea urchin must be blended into the tomato sauce with an immersion blender or something because you get the sweet, nutty earthy taste of sea urchin in every single bite. A must try and a must return for dish.\n\nFor dessert I had a trio of gelato that changed my life. Which one? The goat cheese and fig gelato. Out of this world.  A kind of dry, creamy taste from the goat cheese and crunchy bits of candied figs all wrapped up into this tasty ball of gelato. Party in your mouth! The chocolate was okay (I'm not a chocolate fan) and then there was a scoop of madeira raisin (like rum raisin). The madeira was strooongggg but tolerable in small bites. \n\n:)\n\nP.S. They ask that you don't take any pictures or use your phones while you are dining here. Therefore, I have no photos to show. This is for you Hen A, because I know you will ask where my pictures are!", "author": "Susy C."}

There is an Old World tone and a comfort food style of cooking that resonates well and is very much appreciated by this diner.  My favorite of the evening was the Malloreddus a sa Campidanese for $16.\nIt is a semolina gnochetti with a pork meat sugo (sauce) and topped with a 12 month aged Pecorino grated cheese. The gnochetti resembled a cavatelli type of pasta.  The pork sauce was rich, meaty, very flavorful and completely satisfying. Our server told us that this is an original family recipe that the owners use here at La Ciccia. \n\nWe shared the following two as starters:\nZupetta de Cocciula Cozzasa e Calamareddusu $13                    \n(Rich Soup of Clams Mussels Calamari and Sea Weeds)\nYou'll want to dip your bread into the broth at the end!  This is a soup and not one of their stews that they also offer.\n \nCalamarusu Arrustiusu  $13\n(Oven Roasted Monterrey Calamari drizzled with basil Oil) \nI was surprised at the number of good sized calamari there were.  There were six calamari and the tentacles were snipped off and ready to be eaten too.  They were fresh tasting and served with mixed greens.\n\nThe breaded and fried pork cutlets will also be my go-to choice the next time I dine here.  They were seasoned perfectly--I believe there were four cutlets.\nFettinasa de Proccu a sa Sapa $23\n(Pan roasted Pork loin served with Saffron Onions)\n\nThe funkiest dish that we had was the spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e bottariga for $18 \n(Fresh Spaghetti with spicy Oil and Bottarga)\nIf I'm correct, the bottarga are dried fish eggs that are grated over your pasta.  The spicy olive oil was rich, thick and did have a kick to it!  I was apprehensive about this dish but it was daringly different and with each bite, I enjoyed it more and more.  This is not served with a red sauce.\n\n\nWe shared the gelato ( three flavors) and a Sicilian cheese cake for dessert.\n Truta de Arriscottu $8 \n(Ricotta and Saffron Cake served with honey and Almonds)   \nThe cake wasn't as moist as I had hoped and the flavors were very subtle.  The honey and slivered almonds offered more taste than the cake itself.\n\nIf you're new to La Ciccia and aren't sure what to order, then I would reccomend these safe choices:\nThe gnochetti and the pork cutlets.  If there are two of you dining, then this would be a perfect pairing to share.\nThere are quite a few wines by the glass to choose from too--your servers will gladly help you navigate that area.\n\nThis is a wonderful restaurant.  Hope you enjoy it too.", "author": "Thomas D."}

Server opened wine bottle and smelled the cork up his nose and then placed it down our table.  That was a first for me since every time I purchase wine I am the one that should be smelling the cork but maybe he smelled something wrong so that's why he smelled it which would have been fine. But to leave it on our table after it's been on his nose and say nothing that is DISGUSTING\n\n2.  I don't remember the name of dish but it's the whole shrimps dish. I took a bite to see if it was cooked right because it looked raw but wasn't sure and sure enough it was.  It was recooked but they could have given another shrimp that I took a bite at to replace but didn't.  It would be right to serve a full amount of food when it was sent raw. They did comp for one glass of champagne that my gf was having but it's only right to because she had to wait while we ate for her dish to be recooked that should be not be a reason tho for it to be ok to not have them place a full serving amount of dish ordered \n\n3. It's nice and cozy but there is also a down fall to it. When servers from other tables are catering to their table we had their butts directed to us as they bent over to talk to their customers.  There were times that it was very close to our faces and I didn't want to make a scene since it wasn't my celebration.

Fitting about 35-40 people, it's a small intimate restaurant that's perfect for foodie dates and small group dinners (no more than a party of 5). \n\nLa Ciccia serves purely Sardinian cuisine. Think Italian with a bit of Mediterranean flair. Like fine dining meets rustic home-style, comfort food, you can tell each dish was made with both precision and love. Everything was superb from start to finish. Don't forget to check out their Sardinian wine list (Pinot fans, try the 2010 Bruni 54 Colli Maceratesi Azienda Agricola La Montata). Service was just as fantastic as the food; very warm, genuine and attentive by all the staff members. \n\nWe started with the Octopus Stew in Spicy Tomato Sauce ($13) which was filled with uber tender octopus in a deliciously thick dark and comforting tomatoey sauce perfect for dipping the crusty bread into. I also enjoyed the Tripe Stew ($12) which was a special appetizer of the night. Rich and hearty, the stew had an abundance of buttery soft honeycomb tripe. Think Italian rendition of menudo but so MUCH better; I never had such soft tripe before. \n\nWe silently shared entrees as well. My Seared Lamb Tenderloin ($26) was perfectly cooked to a medium rare, sliced and drizzled with cooked grape must (syrup). The lamb tenderloin was the best I've had; delicately tender and a bit gamey with lovely licorice, caramel and coffee notes from the grape must. He had the Oven Roasted Whole Wild Prawns ($26) which were four jumbo prawns that were halved and showered with a mouth-watering garlic parsley sauce that was given a nice kick from the pepperoncino. \n\nHe doesn't care for dessert but I was \"PMSing\" according to him so that gave me an even better excuse to splurge on the Ricotta and Saffron Cake ($8) which was like a super moist and crumbly sponge cake topped with lip-smacking honey and crunchy sliced almonds. I was annoyed with him enough to even order the Assorted Gelati of the Night ($8) which showcased their divine homemade ice cream.  Rum, chocolate and figs and goat cheese (my favorite) were the flavors of the night. (I tell you, there's nothing like hitting a guy in the jugular by inflating the dinner bill even more. *Hmmmph*)\n\n*Mr. NSS comes back from the bathroom*\n\nMr. NSS: \"Did you check FB?\"\n\nMe: \"No, now WHY would I do that?!?!

You may only get your reservation a few weeks out or sometime late night. But DO IT because it's totally WORTH IT.  \n\nI had the octopus stew for appetizer. This is the best octopus dish I've ever had. It could be a bit too heavy as an appetizer, but oh my, the flavor of the stew was unforgettable. I could have had a whole bowl of it. I would come back to the restaurant just to have this stew.\n\nFor my second course, I had the squid ink pasta. Sometimes I find squid ink pasta a bit too fishy, but their sauce was well balanced in flavor and the home made pasta definitely gave the dish an additional layer of flavor and pleasant texture.\n\nAs my main dish, I had the pork loin. This dish didn't have as much impact as the first two, but there was nothing bad to say about the dish. Plus I was getting full by the time my main dish was served, so I guess I couldn't enjoy the dish as much as I would have - i.e. the portion of their food was pretty generous considering the quality of the food, which to me is a good thing.\n\nServers were friendly and attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-18", "description": "Went here with 2 girlfriends who had lived with me in Italy a number of years ago- we'd heard great things from fellow friends who had lived in Rome, so we were excited to trek out to La Ciccia and enjoy a Saturday night meal. \n\nRight as we walked in, we noticed it was warm (actually warm, temperature-wise). It was inviting after walking in the cold, but the heat did seem a bit much once we sat down at the table and throughout the dinner. I imagine this is because the place is small and the kitchen gets hot. The ambiance however was great - the decor is upscale but doesn't overdo it - the tables have simple white linens and flatware; The walls and decor are minimal and the vibe is intimate and authentic. \n\nThe staff was absolutely wonderful. Everyone was approachable and friendly, especially when walking us through food and wine pairings for dishes we were unfamiliar with. Our waiter was charming and attentive to us, and even at the end of the meal when the ceiling started leaking (long story short, an upstairs neighbor fell asleep in their bathtub and caused the ceiling to leak into the restaurant), the staff kept their cool and stayed positive throughout! \n\nRegardless of the ceiling mishap, the food was amazing. We split 1 appetizer, 2 pasta dishes and a dessert, as well as bread and wine. It was definitely enough food for three women. We ordered:\n\nBread + Olive Oil - The olive oil tasted light and fresh. The bread was dense and soft in the middle, it reminded me of being back in Italy. They make their own bread in-house and import the olive oil, so it was authentic and delicious. I wish I hadn't eaten so much of it up-front though, because I could have used it later to dip more in the stew and sauce! \n\nBaby Octopus Stew - The octopus was so, so tender. It was cooked well in a red sauce that wasn't too acidic. It was kind of hard to finish the sauce because we didn't have spoons or bowls, but it was great for dipping bread into (and I would have finished it all if I could!). This one is a must-order for sure. \n\nSpaghetti with Fish Roe - This was recommended by everyone, both by yelpers and word of mouth. Our waiter split it up for us and plated it at the table, which was a nice personal touch. The flavor and texture (the roe added nice texture) of the pasta was amazing, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The lingering creamy flavor at the end of each bite was perfection, and it lived up to the reviews. \n\nSea Urchin Fettuccine - We were skeptical of ordering this because of the urchin, but we ordered it after seeing the table next to us eating it... and it was my favorite dish of the night! They actually puree the urchin into the sauce so it's more approachable, and the sauce is red with some sort of cream in it (so it's not as acidic as plain tomato sauce). I savored every bite, and also dipped my bread in this one too. Would highly recommend this. \n\nLemon Ricotta Cake - This was actually not a cake in a traditional sense, but it was great nonetheless. It was more of a lemon ricotta mousse with almonds and honey on top - not overly sweet, it reminded me of baklava in it's nuttiness and texture. I'd order this again, though I was very full! \n\nOverall very happy with the meal, and would be more than happy to go back at a later date!", "author": "Claire S."}

The pasta noodles were chewy and fresh.\n\nThe salad ($9) was good, but nothing too memorable. I probably wouldn't get it again.

The exterior looked super-cute tucked into a Noe street and the interior looked warm, cozy, and romantic. We thought we were in for a great night!\n\nWe were seated quickly. The next 2.5 hours, however, were not so smooth. Each of our group of 4 ordered three courses (app/first course, entrees, and desserts) as well as 1 bottle of wine & 3 glasses of wine between the 4 of us. We were well-dressed and excited for a celebratory dinner. However, throughout the dinner, we noticed that we basically got ZERO service from the staff. When we ordered the wine, I had asked for bread and the server coolly noted that \"it will come with the food.\" It was downhill from there. My companions raved about the famous seafood stew, but I found the pasta first course to be a bit bland in texture/flavor. Before my friend had finished the seafood stew, the waiter came and cleared her plate even though she was still working on it. We thought that meant that the entrees were coming soon, but in fact we waited over 45 minutes for our entrees. We struggled to find a waiter to flag down to ask about our food. When we did, he said that the entrees would be out shortly. When they arrived, they were lukewarm and may have been sitting out for a while. The entrees were ill-balanced - 5 giant delicious shrimp heads but not much else on the plate. My husband got the steak with cauliflower which he said was forgettable. \n\nMeanwhile, we noticed that the two servers were totally being monopolized by two high-maintenance tables. They were chatting up the waitstaff for our entire dinner but unfortunately this caused them to neglect our table and many others. The experience was uncomfortable - we wondered, are we not getting service because we're too young? Not spending enough money? Not older and white? No establishment should have its patrons walk away feeling like that. \n\nWe enjoyed delicious panna cotta for dessert and the check came. Throughout the meal, there was no apology for the poor service. I wanted to love this place, but I found the service poor and the food to be average for the high price.

We started with roasted calamari which were quite delicious with wonderful sauce, and also their special arugala and tomato salad which was fresh.  We also had the baby octopus stew, which had a rather thick tomato sauce- wife liked it a great deal, for me it was a little too tomato thick.  Wife had their special lightly broiled Norwegian salmon, which was wonderful, but my Sardinian fregula (VERY small droplets of pasta)  with sea urchin and shaved tuna heart was again in a very thick and sour tomato sauce almost completely obliterating other flavors- the tomato sauce here is VERY thick, which I did not know.  We also had their Sardinian flat bread with evoo and pecorino, which was wonderful- light and crispy and cheesy.  We also had a small portion of their extra virgin olive oil, which was fine, but not outstanding.  As the evening progressed, the restaurant became very crowded and noisy and the service slowed down to a crawl- about 30 minute wait between the last of the appetizers and the long-awaited arrival of the main course.  They have a very extensive wine list and some artisanal Sardinian beer- I enjoyed the \"diavolo.\"  Overall, an interesting mixed dining experience, but we will probably be back for the calamari, flat bread, and some other of their interesting dishes sans tomato sauce.", "author": "Hoyle L."}

The husband and wife team, Massimiliano Conti and Lorella Degan serve regional Italian cuisine from the island of Sardinia.  \n\nWe've been anxious to try La Ciccia for several months.  Reservations through OpenTable have been hard to come by, but we finally got in last night.   Street parking can be challenging in the area so budget some extra time for finding a spot.  \n\nThe restaurant's understated exterior and quiet street belie the bustling scene once you walk inside.

In several cases, the simple flavors of olive oil, vinegar, and citrus left us wanting more complexity.  Our sense was that the food was often simple but authentically Sardinian.  The dishes that really stood out were the one's with more spice and complexity - the Octopus and Lamb.

I was sad because I wanted to document my meal!  It was excellent.  I am not a huge fan of italian food but La Ciccia was a delicious surprise. I almost wished I had tried more things on the menu because they all sounded delicious\n\nWe started with Sardinan flatbread.  It is like a chip, thin, crispy, cheesy. We also had an appetizer of the day which was a shrimp. I don't remember what kind of shrimp they were or what the sauce was but it was delicious.  The shrimp meat was tender and fresh and the sauce had a bit of spice but did not overpower. We also had a giant plate of salume of the day which was proscuitto. \n\nWe then moved on the pastas or primusu or first courses.  We tried the special pasta which was a fettucine with ragu of veal and pork.  The pasta was so fresh.  it was perfectly cooked and was the perfect consistency for the sauce.  We also had a spaghetti with squid ink and lemon sauce.  That was also delicious.  It was lighter than expected and the lemony tartness was a good complement for the dark sauce.  We were also hoping we had room for the salt cod roe pasta or the sea urchin tuna heart pasta.  maybe next time\n\nWe then shared one main or segundusu. It was a sea bream with olives and zucchini underneath. Also light and delicious.", "author": "claudia y."}

A warmly welcoming experience with very high standards.... La Ciccia is a gift to San Francisco.\n\nIncredible wine list, a whole page of fine print.  Bring your readers and enjoy.  \n\nDaily adventures are excellent. We sampled a rabbit confit with a fine pasta and a reduction and baby octopus in a rich tomato-based broth.  The confit had a symphony of flavors going on from a slight smoky note to a little bit of heat on the finish.  Very very nice.  The octopus was served in broth that if featured in a blues song, would make the lame dance and the sick healthy. The octo was slightly overcooked but totally enjoyable.  Had to order more bread to \"honor\" the broth and reinforce the boiler (for you Kruk and Kuip fans).\n\nContorni, verdure - eatcha vegebles kidz, not because Mama said so but because you LIKE them.  On offer was \"braised cabbage\"... a wholly insufficient label.  I had a premonition this would be good. Well, more like great.  Tender, and succulently sauced but not covered up.\n\nWe both ordered bottariga... it is so essentially great, a perfect poem of garlic, butter, just-right al dente pasta and the unique flavoring and texturing of the bottariga.  So glad that La Ciccia keeps this delight on the menu.  It took a lot of willpower (and the extra boiler bread) to set aside some for next-day enjoyment.\n\nWe're not big on dessert, but the gelato trio was seductive.  A tangy fig-goat cheese creation flanked a chocolate hazelnut centerpiece, with a delicate vanilla-marsala rounding out the hat trick.  A really nice composition!\n\nThe owners really made us feel welcome and comfortable, like being part of a family you'd want to be adopted by.  It's rare to see such high standards in creativity and execution matched with such genuine warmth.  A gem.  Bravo!", "author": "Bob K."}

The baby octopus was absolutely amazing as it came in a nice spicy tomato broth.

I can't believe we've lived down the street for 7 years and never went. I'm kicking myself now that I'm moving.\n\nWe're really spoiled for good food in San Francisco, and this is, hands down, the best meal I've had in five years.\n\nEverything was incredible, the service was lovely, the owners both came and talked to us (they knew the friends we went with). Because one of the people at the table was a chef, she ordered and I set the menu down and simply ate. I chose nothing. The food just came and I enjoyed everything.\n\nI've never cared for sea urchin, but it was delicious. All of the pasta dishes were terrific and I got to try Fregola and bottarga for the first time (the former is kind of like giant couscous, the latter is pressed fish eggs that are salted and shaved). Loved it all.\n\nThe wine was great, the food was fantastic, and the company was even better. \n\nJust go. It's not cheap, but you totally get what you pay for, amazing food, and great service.

To drink, we had an Italian red from Calabria (one of the ~180 on the wine list) - excellent recommendation from the server.\n\nThe absolute highlight of the meal was our pasta (spaghetti with spicy oil and bottarga) - my fiance and I have not stopped talking about it.

Sardinian food is surprising. And salty seafood. But not too salty. And not salty in the bad way that means cranky. The good salty.

So ask a lot of questions. The servers, who are excellent, will steer you right. We had the specialty of the house, a fresh spaghetti (spelled Spaghuttu or something, because that's helpful) with olive oil and fish roe. It was incredible: perfectly prepared pasta, genius flavor pairings. Then there was the Sardinian flat bread. Which is very, very flat. And yummy. I had some prawns, which were butterflied after being roasted in shell, and topped with a small amount of sweet tomato sauce. I could probably do without the tomato sauce, but only because the prawns were so excellent. Then we had the daily fish special, which was grilled and simple and lovely. \n\nThe only downside was the dessert: a semifreddo that was way too cold, and hence brittle.

Not a big fan of being inside a stuffy restaurant that has a noticeable fish odor nor being next to the kitchen entrance. Nonetheless, I was up for an adventure since I was totally unfamiliar with Sardegna and both the inland and coastal cuisine. We shared the octopus stew which had a richly aromatic and flavorful tomato based broth and fish that was a bit too chewy for my palette. The burrata with mixed greens and fava beans was satisfactorily seasoned. I chose the tuna which was served on a bed a greens (red swiss chard? perhaps?). It was seriously overcooked but very flavorful. There were four in our party and one had the pasta with squid ink which was to my thinking a bit too overpowering in fish flavor and bit too gummy. \n\nThe ricotta cake had a lovely presentation and texture but seemed to have reached its expiration date or had been stored in an inappropriate metal container. Not sure which.\n\nNonetheless, it was a fun experience thanks to the staff. Would I go back if I were here in Noe again? Perhaps.", "author": "Kathryn R."}

It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible, it was ok.\n\nFirst off, we had dinner reservations and the boyfriend was a bit late.  I got chastised by the hostess because of it.  I understand that you're turning over tables, but it wasn't super busy that night because you still had a few empty tables.  Secondly, you shouldn't be chastising me...feel free to yell at him when he gets here, but I am the one on time.  I already feel like an idiot standing in the rain waiting for him to show up, you do not need to chastise me too for something I didn't even do.\n\nWe ended up running into our friends who were also on date night there, so we decided to make it a double date night and join forces together.\n\nI thought all of the food was way over salted.  We started with the octopus stew.  I'm not a huge seafood person, but I can appreciate the deliciousness of the sauce/stew here.  Sop it up with the bread please!  We also ordered the smoked pancetta, pretty basic...you can't really go wrong there.  And we ordered the buratta, also it's hard to go wrong there.\n\nOur next dish we ordered was the fusilli with the sea urchin and cured tuna heart. WAY WAY WAY too salty.  I didn't enjoy it one bit at all.\n\nFor our entrees, I really wanted the gnochetti.  The boyfriend got pork loin.  Our friends got the lamb and the prawns.  When my gnochetti came out I just stared at it for a second.  All I could see on my plate were what looked like tiny maggots.  Not an appetizing thing to be faced with when hungry.  I hesitantly took a bite and found it to be...salty.  I ate maybe 1/4 of the dish because it was just a bit too salty for me.  The boyfriend agreed too.  Look, I'm not one that is all crazy about salt, but I just felt that night everything was a little oversalted for my taste.  The pork loin was also salty and my friend complained about her prawns too.\n\nI wasn't impressed.", "author": "Quynh-An P."}

And if you are planning on sharing it--don't. My boyfriend was kind enough since it was our anniversary but deep inside i'm sure he was sad to see the half the dish consumed by me, and plus the serving is just enough to fill one tummy, not that large of a portion to share. The spaghetti is unlike anything I've tasted, it was perfectly doughy and sprung back with every bite, idk just try it...and the sauce (bottarga) was so full of flavor...the entire dish was perfect.\n\nSeafood linguini with squid ink/lemon-I'm trying not to compare it with the bottarga because they are completely on different taste levels, but this dish is worth the try if you don't want the bottarga.\n\nFor the entree we got the lamb- it was pretty, good flavor, nothing particularly amazing like the pasta dishes but if you like lamb i'm sure you'd like this.\n\nafter much contemplation of whether or not to order another bottarga...we settled on dessert! Our very insightful server highly recommended the Sardinian Ricotta and Saffron Cake-- it was perfect. A flavorful, light dessert that didn't feel too indulgent but was suffice for the sweet craving. Saffron wasn't as strong but the dish had a wonderful flavor overall. \n\nAs far as ambiance-- it gave me a romantic/modern rustic vibe. It is a smaller place so it's intimate for two or a close group of 4-6 would fit perfectly there. Nice lighting, clean and it has semi open kitchen, there is also bar seating. \n\nParking--good luck!

Both of these dishes were excellent, but I thought the spicy octopus stew was heavenly and sopped up every bit of the sauce I could with the great salty bread they serve. \n\nThen we shared the Fregua cun Pisci e su Nieddu de Seppia (fregola with seafood and squid ink). This dish was also excellent. \n\nFor entrees we had: Camberonisi Arrustiusu (grilled prawns) and Pezza de Angioni a sa Saba (lamb). Both entrees were great, but I loved the first 2 dishes even better. \n\nFor desert we had: Prattu de Casu Isolanu (Sardinian cheese plate) and Semifreddu de Turroi e Ciululatti (semifreddu frozen desert).

Was looking for a late night eatery not too far from SFO airport, and found La Cicca on Yelp (thanks fellow Yelpers!).  This place is a hidden gem!  It's not every day that one finds an authentic Sardinian restaurant in the US!\n\nStarted with a plate of a local speck in the style of Trentino - not your typical prosciutto, much closer to something you'd find in Austria or Germany (not surprising given Trentino's history), and a side of Sardinian sheet music bread.  Both were excellent, and the fatty, smoky ham paired with the salty and crunchy bread gave me a pretty good sign that I was in for a spectacular meal.\n\nMoved on to spaghetti with bottarga.  Now, if you have never had bottarga, you absolutely have to try it! It is a Sardinian specialty that is made from dried fish eggs which are then grated like parmesan over pasta.  The taste is absolutely incredible!  Like they figured out how to preserve the ocean.  And it is very hard to find in the States.  This rendition was perfect, with a very nice al dente pasta, and just enough garlic and oil to complement the other flavors. I felt like I was back in Italy!\n\nThe staff was terrific too, spoke with several of the waiters, all of whom were recent Italian immigrants, and all of whom were delightfully friendly.

It wasn't out of the park, omg, spectacular, but it was a great experience.\n\nSo, we went with the calamari and stewed octopus for our appetizers.  I don't know about you, but I sort of like the semi-raunchiness of a chewy octopus.  The octopus was so soft and tender, that it could've been squid in that briney sauce.  I guess that's a great skill and testament to the chef, but I may not be considered a true foodie, because I actually like slightly chewy octopus.  Or, I'm just kinda raunchy?\n\nThe pasta with grated tuna heart was super rich with iodine, that it initially was over powering, but afterwards, we started to have cravings for it.  It's sort of like the same effect of the heat in spicy foods which releases some level of endorphins to make someone addicted.   \n\nOur server seemed new to the place, or sort of green to the restaurant's menu, as she didn't remember the specials and forgot a couple of requests.

I've noticed in the studio and at sound checks, Paolo is obsessive about quality, so it was a good sign he is right there.  He never stopped moving the whole night, always taking care of things.  Not the type to stand around and chat with his co-workers.  Then there was our waitress. Despite a somewhat indecisive person at our table, she was patient, explained everything, and seemed to know every wine on the incredibly long list.  Her choices were excellent.  And then on of the owners came by after we finished and chatted about the meal.  You can't ask for better service.\n\nAnd then the food.  I spotted a huge plate of prosciutto as we walked to our table and we started with that.  It was silky and delicious.  The waitress told us it was sliced to order and it tasted like it.  Starters, I had the octopus stew - a good quantity of tiny whole octopus in a rich, thick tomato base.  Very tasty.  Others had the roast calamari, which were perfect.  Tender and with an aromatic wash of oil and maybe herbs.  On to the main course - I had hoped to have the whole fish I have seen in photos, but it was not in so they substituted ahi.  Not my first choice usually but very nice on a bed of chopped cabbage with caramelized onions on top.  Again, super tasty.  I can't eat sugar, so I had the cheese plate for desert, the sheep's cheese was delicious, the other two quite good.\n\nThe wines were excellent, as I mentioned above, and reasonably priced.\n\nCriticisms?  Well it's loud, and I don't hear that well, so that part is a little tough.  And it's a tiny space, although we didn't feel cramped even though we were at the back table next to the wine rack.\n\nWe had been talking about coming here for quite a while and it was far better than the talk.

Flavors are bold and adventurous, service is sublime. Here's a quick rundown:\n1st\n* octopus stew -- tender octopus in a rich, spicy tomato-based sauce with a hint of seafood flavor\n* roasted calamari -- served with a pesto oil and also extremely tender\n2nd\n* fresh linguine with a sea urchin and tuna heart sauce -- this was a revelation! Strong flavors, but so delicious!\n3rd\n* lamb tenderloin -- also very tender and delicious (I know I'm repeating myself!)\n4th\n* ricotta cake covered in toasted almond flakes. Light and moist and a nice way to finish the meal.\n\nWe were very happy with our decision to let our waiter choose the wines for us. He gladly split a glass of wine for each of the first 3 courses, and the pairings were perfect, an on-the-fly degustation menu.\n\nI highly recommend La Ciccia, and our only problem now is deciding which friends we'll bring with us next time!", "author": "Matt G."}

But the baby octopus had a mushy (isn't it supposed to be chewy?) texture inside a tomato stew that was good but extremely hard to share amongst 4 people. Pretty good flavors and good on bread :)\n\nSEA BREAM: Very clean and fresh fish, cooked and seared perfectly. The seasoning was simple, but I wanted a little more flavor.\n\nGOAT RIGATONI (daily special): Delicious, tender goat meat - similar to braised pork - in a tomato sauce. The rigatoni was cooked al dente and tasted fresh. Yum!\n\nSQUID INK LINGUINE: My FAVE. I loved the mixture of fresh seafood in the al dente chewy linguine noodles. Usually squid ink kinda freaks me out but this was really delicious! The portion was generous, and I probably shouldn't have finished it (but I did. Oops). \n\nVEAL SCALLOPINI: This was the table favorite, although I don't know if I fully appreciated it because I don't like anything breaded.

It's not like traditional Italian fare besides the fact that pasta is offered.\n\nWe had 3 dishes to share - the Sardinian flatbread, veal tripe in tomato sauce and pecorino cheese, and squid ink pasta.\nThe flatbread was light, crispy, slightly greasy, cheesey, and herb-y. I really enjoyed the pecorino cheese atop. It would make a great dipper for sauces (which we did use on the veal tripe).\nThe tripe came in a bowl drenched in a tangy tomato sauce and cheese. It was unlike anything I ever had before. I loved the tomato-y, cheesy flavor and the chewy softness of the tripe. Tripe is not for everyone, but if you enjoy it try it because the flavor is amazing and the preparation is totally unique. \nThe squid ink pasta came slathered in black ink and had a nice touch of herbs. The ink itself tasted quite mild but the lemony flavor really stood out and the texture of the noodles. It can be a messy dish so eat it with care and lady-likeness =)\n3 dishes were enough for the 2 of us. I also ordered a glass of wine and the bill came out to about 60 dollars before tax.\n\nThe wait staff were cordial and the owner was totally gracious by pulling up an extra chair and making room for us at the bar. We didn't have reservations and they were very accommodating. \n\nThere was a nice pause between dishes, not too quickly so we could chat and enjoy the wine, but not too long where we were wondering where the food was. \n\nThis is a great date night place since it's cozy and romantic, and the wait staff are attentive but will also provide you enough space to enjoy your food and company.", "author": "Brandy A."}

The taste is very strong and is an acquired taste!  \n\nYou must order Sardinian wine to have with your meal!

I started eating at La Ciccia 6 years ago when it opened. It was a hidden gem then and I am only writing a review now that everyone has figured out what a great place this is! I was hopingi t would by my little secret but now its hard to get a table.\n\nEverything on the menu is made with high quality and fresh ingredients. The seafood salad appetizer is a must. The baby octopus in tomato stew is awesome. The octopus is so tender, and pairs perfectly with the salty and slightly spicy soup. The grilled calamari is fresh and delicious.  All of the pastas are made fresh. My BF always gets the gnochetti with pork sugo.  I like the squid ink pasta.  Sometimes they have a special ravioli stuffed with ricotta and orange zest and a wild boar or lamb ragu sauce This is to die for.  We also like the pork tenderloin pan fried and lightly breaded with saffron onions.\n\nThe wine list is great. All Italian wines and many from Sardinia. The staff is super helpful in helping you pick a great wine to go with your meal. They also let us taste many varieties to make sure we settle on just what we want.\n\nThe owners and staff at La Ciccia are so nice and friendly. The chef and owner always comes out to talk to customers and you can tell he takes a lot of pride in his work.   Its owned by a husband and wife and they love to chat about Sardinia and the food.

The atmosphere was very cozy and intimate, had a nice warm vibe to it, like you were at home. Service was impeccable. \n\nWe started off with the Prupisceddu in Umidu (octopus stew) as I was told by many it was simply amazing. It stood up to my expectations 100%. The octopus was tender and the sauce was a nice deep dark red tomato spicy sauce with tons of flavor. I dipped my bread into it and I couldn't stop eating it. I would have probably drank it if I could!!! Delish!!\n\nThe next course was Spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga. This dish was also done to perfection. The pasta was done al dente with just the right amount of sauce and egg roe. The portion was a decent amount for two to share. \n\nOur last course was Oratina in Padella Cun Olia Sarda. Again a good size portion for two to share. Two big filets of sea bream with some sort of olive tapenade on top. The fish was moist and flavorful and went down smoothly with my glass of white wine.\n\nFor dessert we had the trio of gelatos. My favorite flavor was the goat cheese with fig. The other flavor was chocolate and some sort of Italian liquor flavor, both were also very nice.\n\nI was amazed at how delicious the food was, how cozy the ambiance was and how great the service was.

While he was never rude, he barely ever smiled and was rather stoic in any interactions we had with him.   For example, when he first approached our table, his first question was whether we wanted tap or sparkling water.  There was no \"Hello\" or \"Welcome\" or \"How are you this evening\", just something small to welcome/greet a guest.  His lack of friendliness was almost intimidating in asking him questions about the menu and trying to get recommendations for various pastas.  I think when you are dining at a $$$ restaurant that is a small neighborhood joint, you expect to get hospitable service. \n- I greatly did not like the fregola pasta with sea urchin tomato and grated tuna hearts.  I am someone who loves sea urchin, and have eaten it in pasta form such as SPQR's sea urchin smoked fettucine (delicious!) but this pasta really missed the mark.  Creamy tomato, sea urchin, and tuna hearts do not go well together in a combo, and of top of that the pasta that is used are these tiny pieces of pasta which I think is the wrong type of pasta for trying to absorb all the creaminess of this dish. I felt like I was eating creamy tomato soup with a fishy taste on top.  This was a big miss in my opinion.  \n\n I would like to go back and try some other dishes like the squid ink, but would also like to get a different waiter next time.", "author": "Mary X."}

You know what I mean.  There are many restaurants that offer similar platters of salumi, wood fire oven baked pizzas and pastas in the city.  But nothing really sets one apart from another.  They are not bad, just not special or memorable.\n\nI took my bff from the east coast here for dinner.  I could not find a table through opentable for a Friday evening so I called, with my fingers crossed, and was advised to come early for walk-in seating.  I made my jet-lagged bff hustle despite his late afternoon meetings in downtown and long lines of tourists at the BART station and lucky for us beat the Friday evening rush.\n\nIt wasn't until after we opened our menus that I realized this place specialized in Sardinian cuisine.  My bad.   As can be imagined from Sardinia being an island, most of their offerings are sea food based.  The wine list was mind boggling and really requires a magnifying glass to go through everything.  A handful are offered by the glass.\n\nWe had salad with shaved pecorino and anchovies, sardines in spicy garlic sauce, fresh spaghetti with mullet roe in spicy garlic sauce, and fresh linguini with smoke fish in squid ink sauce.  I was blown away by both pasta dishes.  Initially I was a little skeptical about having fish egg sauce with spaghetti, but it felt more like creamy egg sauce than crunchy flying fish roe I associate with sushi, and the texture of the fresh pasta was just right.  The smoked fish pasta with squid ink sauce had the aroma of smoke but the taste was surprisingly mild and perfectly balanced with lemon juice.  For dessert we shared a ricotta almond cake with honey.  My bff commented that everything was on the noticeably salty side, which I agreed, but I had had the same experience when I was traveling in Italy recently so I am inclined to accept it as being authentic.  \n\nThe service was great.  I just need to figure out how I can be on the regulars list (or special guest list?) of the madame of the house so she will greet me with a warm hug (and sometimes kiss on the cheek) like she did to many who came that night.", "author": "Alice A."}

Considering my mild obsession with Italian culture, I was curious to see what Sardinian cuisine was all about. \n\nFirst impressions were good. The restaurant was small and homey, but not overly fancy. In true Italian style, the menu was split into appetizers, first courses (mainly pastas), and second courses (meats/seafood). The names of the dishes were written in both the Sardinian dialect, which added a nice rustic feel, and slightly garbled English that sounded like it was spit out of a menu-item generator. (\"Semolina Gnochetti with Pork meats Sugo and 12 Months Pecorino\"... huh?) In combination with the Italian accents of the servers, I almost believed was in Sardinia for real. :)\n\nThe food was more of a mixed bag. In an attempt to sample the more unique items on the menu, we started with the salume of the day, which turned out to be a beautifully presented plate of prosciutto (not unlike a sashimi rose), and the baby octopus stew. The prosciutto was decent, if a bit too salty, and the stew had an interesting spicy flavor that I couldn't quite decide if I liked. Overall, just okay.\n\nNext up were Is Primusu (first courses): squid ink fregula and garlic pasta. Having eaten squid ink pasta once before on a trip to Venice and been completely blown away, I had high expectations! Sadly, the flavor of the fregula was nothing like I remembered: weirdly tangy, lemony, and rubbery, entirely unlike the rich, warm taste of that meal many years ago. The garlic pasta was tasty, but in the way that you'd expect any pasta alfredo to be - better than average, but not by much.\n\nNot much to say on Is Segundusu (garlic prawns and lamb) here since I don't eat lamb, but the prawns weren't bad. They made them seem a lot bigger than they actually were by cutting them in half, but at least both dishes were nicely presented over tasty veggies.\n\nBy the time we polished off the last of the lamb, I was a bit disappointed -- maybe  my expectations were too high, but I just hadn't been impressed by any of the dishes. Luckily, the dessert ended up being the best part of the experience! We ordered the Truta de Arriscottu, a ricotta and saffron cake with almonds, and the seasonal sorbet: a small scoop each of passionfruit, black cherry and apricot. The sorbet was too sweet for me, but the Truta was an absolute delight! Nice and creamy with just the right level of sweetness. \n\nBest of all, just as we started to dig in, the chef swung by to say hi and explained how he made the Truta... then brought us a plate of gelato, on the house! We should have ordered it from the start -- each of the flavors (chocolate hazelnut, marcello wine and another I can't recall) was simply divine.\n\nIt was a memorable meal, made much better by the fantastic service and dedication of the owners. Unfortunately, I just wasn't impressed by the food. At $35 per person, it wasn't ridiculous, but I'd much rather spend that kind of cash on food that will make me happy to eat.", "author": "Grace K."}

When we saw how busy they were, we waited patiently -- the hostess told us we'd get seated closer to our 9:45pm reservation.\n\nAt 10:30pm, I got antsy and asked for estimated seating time.  The hostess apologized explaining that diners just weren't leaving although several tables had either paid or had their check on the table.\n\nThere was another couple waiting outside with us; I asked what time their reservation was, he replied 9:45pm.  Note: they arrived at the restaurant much later than us.  They got seated before we did.\n\nThe owner finally came out at 10:45pm and asked if she could get us \"started\" and offered two seats at the bar/ counter. We accepted because we were hungry and tired of waiting.  I sat at the middle corner of the counter where there's a large ass beam within 5\" of my face.  Awkward.  My husband overheard that they were out of the spicy seafood stew as well as several other items we were looking forward to eating.  We left.\n\nNote to La Ciccia -- don't be so damn greedy and overbook your dining reservations. You must know this by now: If a table orders bottles of wine, chances are great that they will linger. If you cannot seat your customer 30 minutes past their confirmed reserved time, you better have a contingency plan for them.  \n\nAdvise:  prepare to wait...a long ass time...take a snack with you.  Hell, pack an entire meal with you because your reservation will not be honored in the confirmed time. Hell will freeze over quicker than getting your reservation honored in a timely manner at this joint.", "author": "kijibe l."}

Small space but with a nice ambiance, it felt authentically Italian.\n\nUnfortunately, the food ranged from amazing to average to subpar.  As mentioned by previous reviewers, the Baby Octopus in Spicy Tomato Stew is delectable.  It's a must-have!  My girlfriend ordered a pizza, which was good but not memorable.  I had a pasta dish (can't remember the name and I don't see it on the menu online) which was wayyyyy too salty.   I tried to enjoy it, and the pasta noodles itself were very delicious, but the sauce was simply too overpowering and overwhelming.  I was very disappointed.\n\nOverall, a solid Italian place but in my opinion, does not live up to the high ratings.  Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things, but I probably will not be taking a special trip back here again, given I live on the Peninsula and reservations for this place are not the easiest to make.", "author": "Andrew K."}

Booked it a month ago as I know the place is always packed. Second time I have been here and it doesn't disappoint! One of my favourite places to eat in San Francisco.\n\nWe started out our meal with complimentary basket of bread. It didn't come with any olive oil so we had to ask for that. Kind of weird that it didn't come with the usual olive oil/balsamic vinegar but maybe that's the norm? Make sure you get another basket of bread to dip in the octopus stew sauce! So goooooood, I could eat that sauce all day.\n\nAnyways, for the food, we ordered:\n\n- Octupus stew ($13) - definitely a must! Octopus cooked so tender and stew is so good with the bread dipped in it.\n- Oyster ($13) - the soup/broth it was in was a bit watery (I'm guessing from the oyster releasing it's own juices into the sauce when it was cooked). My mom really liked it though. I thought it was only okay.\n- Fresh fusilli with sea urchin tomato and cured tuna heart ($18) - perfectly al dente fusili pasta. Love how they cook their pasta so well.\n- Semolina gnochetti with pork meat sugo and pecorino ($16)  - also perfectly al dente. This one was my main dish and I ate it all. \n- Seared lamb tenderloin ($26) - you get 8 pieces of tender lamb slices. Cooked perfectly (my dad asked for medium).\n- Roasted mediterrian sea bream ($26) - skin on the bottom and nice soft texture on top. \n- Nougat and chocolate semifreddo ($8) - we split it four ways as we were stuffed. Perfect way to end our meal. Light, almost tasted like ice cream.\n- My dad also got a rasberry sorbet with a candle for his birthday as we told our waitress last minute that it was his birthday! So nice of them.\n\nAs I said before, one of my favourite places to go to when we visit SF! Very warm, inviting atmosphere with friendly and well trained staff. Food cooked to perfection. This is how it should be done. Other restaurants, take some notes. La Ciccia, je t'aime.", "author": "Jonny M."}

This place is average at best, 2.5 stars and I will not be going back.\n\nThe burrata app and the grilled calamari...eh to both and the calamari had a fishy smell.

This pretty much sums up my dining experience here.\n\nOur party was seated over 45 minutes after our reservation time because \"the tables are moving slowly.\" The restaurant should accept fewer reservations and not make people wait this long.\n\nThe quality of the food is excellent, but despite the pleasing taste, it was difficult to finish each dish. There was a \"heaviness\" in the food and a few bites were enough. It was as though one's palate became fatigued and the desire to eat more was curiously absent (I usually want to eat _more_ of food that I like).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-25", "description": "This is the most amazing Italian restaurant in San Francisco and as far as I know, one of the only ones that serves regional Italian cuisine (other than maybe Locanda, which specializes in Roman classics like pasta with amatriciana, cacio e pepe, or carbonara) like you might find if you were to go to a local trattoria in Italy where only the favorites of the province and the family's recipes are made without compromise to American palates for clam linguini and spaghetti with red sauce. There's certainly a time and place for Italian American classics too, or new American/Italian places like Beretta or Delfina  - you just won't find those same menu items here. I think part of enjoyment here is amending your expectations before you come - this is uncompromising Sardinian fare and if you come in not enjoying seafood or al dente pasta, this restaurant will disappoint you, through no fault of its own. You could certainly eat Italian for cheaper in the city, but I reason that since I don't have the time or the money to return to Italy, this is the next best thing. \n\nLa Ciccia is cozy, loud, and intense, both the food and the ambiance. Anything seafood will be stellar - especially the squid with basil oil and spaghetti with bottarga. I have never eaten anything as light or intensely savory as that bottarga. We also tried the fregola with tuna hearts and uni which I found too rich for me given the heaviness of the sauce and how compact and dense fregola is, but that's just me and my dining companion enjoyed it more than I did. Everything was simple, probably less than 5 ingredients in each dish, nothing extraneous in each plate.

La Ciccia is so authentic that I have lost the will to go to any other Italian restaurant in San Francisco. I'm sure there are other great Italian places in the city but it's a 70 mile drive and I don't have the time to be disappointed. It's a known quantity. \n\n Lorella the wife of the husband and wife team runs the front of the house and has the ability to project hospitality, passion, positivity and respect in marathon sessions. Massimo, the husband half does the food, it's regional and distinct and executed with remarkable consistency. The octopus stew is brilliant. If they are not there the place is closed.\n\nLa Ciccia is small and very popular, be patient when it gets crowded and don't let anyone fool you if they had a bad experience there it's either a fluke, they don't understand Italian food or they are the type that are difficult satisfy.\n\nThis is the best in SF", "author": "Joey C."}

When it comes to service I would say it's very good, when it comes to food - mediocre and overpriced in my view (increasingly common experience in San Francisco for me unfortunately). We shared an appetizer special - which included few sad pieces of commercial grade mozzarella (kind you buy in the supermarket in plastic tub filled with milk serum) with a tiny Arugula salad so overdressed with oil and vinegar it was impossible for me to tell if it's Arugula or lawn grass. That was $16. We also had sardinian flat bread for $8 and I am sad to report that you can get better one in Trader Joe's (imported from Italy, for $3). On to pasta dishes, I ordered their Fresh Spaghetti Spicy Garlic Oil Salt Cured Fish Roe for $22. Pasta was indeed fresh and cooked well. Unfortunately it was also drenched in some sort of cheap industrial oil that formed a large pool at the bottom of the dish. It also had unpleasant artificial aftertaste. My companion ordered Sardinian Fregula Sea Urchin Tomato Shaved Tuna Heart also for $22. Grain size pasta was probably ok but I couldn't tell because it was drowned in heavy tomato cream based sauce. I see no point in using Sea Urchin or Tuna Heart in this dish because ground fish tales would taste just the same overpowered by the sauce. For dessert we shared Sardinian Ricotta and Saffron Cake Honey and Toasted Almond for $9. It was basically sandy dry 'ricotta' you get in the plastic tub at Safeway with some almonds on the top. Thanks to very attentive service I had plenty of water so I didn't choke. My mood was not helped by a next table where grown up daughter and her father proceeded to drink a bottle of wine and their loud conversation turned from artificial pleasantries to nastiness I would rather not listen to. At the end of the day I have a simple choice if I want a decent pasta dish - Michelin level place in San Francisco (SPQR or Acquerello) or a trip to Italy. So sad!", "author": "Mikhail K."}

The food here is consistently delicious, the atmosphere is cozy, and the wine list is so long you should just let them pick for you.

I have dreams about this pasta and always end up ordering it every time. The owners are lovely and they treat their guests like family. \n\nThis is not a super fancy scene or hipster hotspot; authentic, regional food is the star here. I started making reservations about once a month at La Ciccia well in advance because they book up very fast, especially on weekends.

Next time the kitchen will be asleep at the wheel.  Or the most talented cook got hit by a bus since the last visit.  Whatever.  Bad karma happens.\n\nNot here.  La Ciccia is really just un-freaking-believable.  \n\nThe fresh linguine with fava beans and sausage is **what pasta is about**.\n\nThe pasta is fresh, still immaculately al dente, the sauce is thin enough to make the noodles the star, and there is enough starch to ensure it *sticks*.  And, most importantly, the fava beans and sausage have absorbed enough of the sauce to be *integrated* into the dish properly.\n\nLet me reiterate the basic point here:  this is *what pasta is about*.  A good pasta dish is complete on two levels:  texturally it is about the *pasta*, and flavor-wise it is about the *total integration of all elements*.  Getting both of these elements right is very, very difficult, a high-wire act, and here it is pulled off elegantly.  They make it look easy.\n\nIt's just very rare to see this level of execution in Italian food; I haven't seen it in two-Michelin-star places in New York City run by certain men in clogs, and most certainly never here in San Francisco.  \n\nThe best way to describe the lamb dish is \"magical.\"  I was a little worried when I saw the squeeze-bottled balsamic on the plate (IMO balsamic as a garnish of any sort is a very mid-90s affair).  But this dish is no bullshit.  The lamb is sliced thin, perfectly cooked and seasoned (including nice hints of fennel seed) and served with this long-cooked red pepper and broccoli business that belongs in the finale to a certain Pixar movie.  \n\nWhat more can I say about La Ciccia?  \n\nWell, first off, please, if this review makes you want to go here, please, erase it from your mind.  Here, let me get out my neuralizer and zap you.  This place is hard enough to get into already.  What am I doing here on Yelp at 1am trying to convince more people to come.

A unique spot in the Bay Area - with a Sardinian menu that has some unusual offerings (pasta with shaved tuna heart, anyone?) but plenty of familiar-feeling dishes for the less adventurous as well (we enjoyed a lovely gnochetti - tiny shell pasta - with a tomato-based pork ragu, and one of our dining companions had a simple mushroom pizza).  \n\nIt's been a while since we've been here and we were happy to see that they've really upped the number of vegetarian dishes - at least a few of the pasta dishes and a couple of the pizzas.  That said, they do meats nicely as well.\n\nExtremely comprehensive (though unfamiliar) wine list, luckily our server was able to steer us to a delicious and reasonably priced bottle, because between the dim lighting, the two point font and the hundreds of Italian wines we'd never heard of, we would have been totally lost.  Service was impeccable - friendly, very knowledgeable, but not hovering or obsequious.  The lovely owner Lorella stopped by to check in and make sure we enjoyed our meal, and we noticed that she greeted most diners like old friends.\n\nLa Ciccia combines the feel of an intimate neighborhood restaurant with world-class cooking and an unusual cuisine that you won't find in a lot of places - a winning combination!", "author": "Katy M."}

During that year I traveled all over Italy eating my way through every town, village and city. Due this experience I'm very picky about \"Italian cuisine\". La Ciccia serves the same sort of food that you would find off the beaten track in Italy.  For appetizers my date and I shared the octopus stew and the grilled Montery calamari. Both dishes were amazing and exemplified the basis to all great Italian food: fresh, high quality ingredients prepared in a way that doesn't mess with  the natural essence of the food. Next I had the lamb served with a reduction of grape must over Swiss Chard sauteed with pancetta. The lamb was perfectly cook and the reduction tasted like a balsamic reduction without the acidic element (excellent!). My date had the Trout which she likes so much she wouldn't talk to me until it was all gone. \n\nThe service was great! In a pleasant atmosphere where you don't have to scream to be heard even during the busiest time.\n\nThis restaurant is also a great choice for people with gluten and dairy issues. The kitchen uses no butter in it's cooking and  most all the dairy is from sheep. \n\nI've read some of the negative reviews and when I hear someone say that this food is \"boring\" its obvious to me that they don't have a very sensitive palette. Authentic food like this is not for people who need to be clubbed over the head with salt, spice or deep frying. \n\nI can't wait to go back again!", "author": "Michael W."}

My friend first came here over the summer and was raving about how great the food was and how cute the place was.  It's definitely hidden, and fortunately, parking around here is pretty easy.  The space is definitely small, so make a reservation!  The place was packed on a Thursday night, but right when you walk in, you're greeted warmly, and everyone working there genuinely seems to enjoy being there.\n\nThe wine list is mostly Italian, so we went with a Sardinian wine recommended by our server. I was pleasantly surprised by how much she knew about the wines.\n\nWe did everything family style between the 4 of us..\n- Mixed greens: simple, but the dressing was a bit heavy for my tastes\n- Baby octopus stew: great for dipping bread, rich, lots of flavor. We started to just spoon the liquid like a soup until we realized there was a layer of olive oil floating on top\n- Fetuccini: special of the day with lamb ragu and porcinis.  The ribbon pasta held the sauce well, and I really loved the scent of the porcinis\n- Linguini: with seafood sugo and squid ink.  The pasta was rich, thick, black, and had great seafood flavor.\n- Gnochetti: with pork sugo and parmigianno. I love the pork ragu and cheese combination. I don't like gnocchi, but this pasta was longer and had a better bite, and it was a close contender for my favorite of the night\n- Prawns: split open, roasted with pepperoncino; again, sauce is great for dipping bread (comes with 4 prawns)\n- Lamb tenderloin: definitely get it medium rare, loved the drizzle of sweet glaze on top and the caramelized greens in the center\n\nThen as we looked through the desserts, we decided to back and get the spaghetti with bottarga, which was the best decision ever since that was my favorite of the night.  The savoriness of the bottarga (reminded me of bonito flakes, subtle) and the spice from the oil was the perfect combination for the spaghetti. The spaghetti was thicker and was the best example of perfectly cooked fresh hand made pasta.  I think this was clearly the most popular dish at our table.\n\nFood was different from the typical Italian places, and everything was executed well.  The setting would actually be really nice for a date, too. My only complaint was the fruit flies that kept landing on our wine glasses, water glasses, etc.  In the end, with tip, it was about $68 a person, and we were all stuffed.

For a fairly expensive place they are far from pretentious. I liked everything I had there, but of course a few things were better than others. The spaghetti with bottarga is their signature dish and was more than fantastic. Perfectly cooked spaghetti laden with tons if olive oil and garlic with bottarga. I was informed that bottarga is a dried fish that they grate to mix in with the pasta. It wasn't very fishy at all and it was pretty outstanding.

I've tried many Italian restaurants here in San Francisco, but this is hands down the closest taste to home.  A wonderful Sardinian restaurant tucked away in peaceful Noe Valley.\n\nWe ordered the baby octopus stew as an appetizer, and I think I ingested a couple of bread baskets in order to soak up the sauce.  I wanted to make sure the plate was spotless so the dishwasher wouldn't have to work so hard.  Need I say more?\n\nWe followed up with the squid ink linguine with seafood sugo, and toasted fregola with sea urchin tomato and cured tuna heart.  Both were excellent, but the fregola now holds a special place in my heart, and in my belly of course.  It was unlike anything I've had before; however, its intense sea flavor brought me back to the Mediterranean and the sensational fish I was so blessed to eat everyday.\n\nWe didn't order dessert, as the freshly baked bread loaves soaked in octopus bliss from earlier were still lingering in my belly.\n\nService could have been a tad bit more conscientious, but I'll take impeccable food over half-assed service anyday.

My husband and I went with another couple so between the four of us we got to try a good portion of the menu.\n\nTo start, I got the octopus soup...it was so warm and comforting (especially in these cold San Francisco summers).  Actually reminded me of some dishes I had in Spain and Portugal.  Also got to try a bit of the burrata which my friend ordered and it was also quite delicious.  \n\nFor my main course, I had the spaghetti with bottarga...I think this is probably the single best thing they have on the menu.  The spaghetti was perfectly cooked, just the right amount of al dente, and the sauce was light but flavorful.  I can just eat this all day long.  I also got to sample the linguini with squid ink, which I also liked, and the semolina gnocchi, which I thought was just ok but my friend loved (I'm just not much of a gnocchi person).\n\nAs a self-proclaimed \"cheese-aholic\", I *had* to get the cheese plate for dessert.  I liked all the cheeses but preferred the aged one the most.  The different types of honey were pretty cool as well, and went well with the cheeses.  Hubby got some gelato with a strawberry topping (one of their specials) which he really liked.\n\nThe wine list was pretty reasonably-priced, and the server gave us some good recommendations based on our preferences, especially since I'm not as knowledeable about Italian wines, and have never had any Sardinian wines before.

No checkered tablecloths. No bulbous chianti bottles with candles dripping their wax on the neck. No Lady and certainly no Tramp. No single spaghetti strand with the meatball precariously balanced in the middle. Sorry paisan.\n\nMy good friends Jonathan and Sydnie - always in the know about the city's cool eats - took me as they have passed the threshold of being regulars there. Hell, I didn't even know that Sardinia had its own cuisine. It's the island way out in the Mediterranean with only Corsica for company, and you know the French. The smiling co-owner Lorella certainly appreciated the repeated presence of my friends enough to come by twice to make sure we were enjoying our dining experience there. We were.\n\nEverything looked good on the menu, and we shared a couple of dishes - the $21 Seared Lamb Chops in Herb Oil which came with a braised cabbage and the $10 Margherita Pizza. The pizza was simple and tasty with fresh tomato sauce and just the right thin crust. The lamb chops were tasty but only after we sent it back to be cooked a bit longer since it was too rare on the first serve. \n\nWe also tried a couple of their specials, both $14 - a tuna heart that had been cured and sliced carpaccio-style and accompanied by braised Brussel Sprouts, and a homemade macaroni pasta dish served al dente with a meaty lamb ragu sauce. The tuna heart was unique to say the least with the salty taste of an anchovy (fortunate since I like anchovies), but the pasta was a true standout with the hearty, tender lamb the perfect complement.\n\nSince we were so good about sharing dishes, we went overboard and tried two desserts - the $7 Ricotta and Saffron Cake with Candied Fruits and the $9 Pistachio and Roasted Almond Semifreddo. Made with no cream, the cake had a nice, soft consistency as it was swimming in a honey-like syrup. The saffron gave it a distinctly Indian tinge, though Lorella assured us it was genuinely Sardinian. The heart-shaped semifreddo was superb with the ice cream texture just right. We wolfed down both in record time.\n\nEven though the dishes were slightly variable, the presentation was nice as was the subtle, quiet setting. Oddly, the awning is not lit up in the evening, so you may miss it if you are trying to find it the first time since it is on a residential block.

It's a bit on the pricey side, but I'll be back.\n\nLong version:\nI went with my girlfriend on a weekday evening; we didn't have a reservation until that afternoon, but they were able to offer us two seats at their counter for the same day, at the time we wanted.  After eating there I can safely say that the counter is maybe the best seat in the house, because you can see into the kitchen and talk to the chef/owner.\n\nThat chef/owner -- he's not making Americanized-Italian.  He doesn't even have much interest in it.  He's making Sardinia-Italian, exactly as his family would have in the old country, where he learned to cook, and he's running the small local restaurant he would have owned in Italy.  He left the kitchen several times over the course of the evening to chat with patrons, including both many of his regulars and us, first-timers.  He asked how one of our dishes, fresh Monterey sardines in an oil, garlic, lemon sauce, and I honestly answered it tasted too much of oil and garlic,. and not enough of the pure brine-y sardine flavor I was hoping for.  He gave a fascinating explanation of the dish's origin as what families would eat when the fishermen came back to port with their catches, and then, ten minutes later, brought us two perfectly grilled sardines with just a touch of oil, salt, and lemon, and offered them as an \"on-the-house\" taste to honor the dish I was hoping to receive... and they were PERFECT.\n\nEverything else we got was solid; the octopus stew was, to me, worth the hype.  We then split a slow-cooked meat and homemade pasta dish that was outstanding.  We may have had a second fish and dried tuna heart pasta dish; I'm forgetting -- but if not, the chef/owner certainly offered us a tiny taste of the dried tuna heart when I asked about it -- briny salty meaty amazing specialty item he imports.  We didn't try any of the main courses or dessert (we were stuffed!)\n\nThe wine list is both extensive, very affordable, and has a lot of wines by the glass, which they barely mark up from the bottle prices.  Our waitress was very good with her wine recommendations, and poured us small tastes of the glasses we were deciding between.\n\nOur waitress was charming, from Italy herself.  One minor gripe: she clearly had the old-country / old-generation approach of always addressing the male of the couple (me) first, and relatively speaking ignoring my girlfriend, from asking what \"we\" are going to order, to tasting wine, to bringing the check.  In most circumstances, that would bother both of us, but when done with a charming Italian accent, it somehow became okay.\n\nNOTE: What is Sardinian food?  Think Italian, with some Mediterranean influence and more emphasis on fish (and a bit less on meat) than Italy generally.", "author": "Zachary R."}

The 'Spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga - Fresh Spaghetti with spicy Oil and Bottarga' was ok.  My BF loves bottarga and when he questioned how they made it, the chef came out and explained how and gave us a sampler of some from the kitchen.  This was pretty cool.

Rich and hearty, and then we knew we were too full to eat the rest of the stuff we had ordered. \n\nWe ordered Oratina in Padella Cun Olia Sarda - (Roasted Mediterranean Sea Bream served with Sardinian Olives Sugo) and even though this was fish, it was fantastic reheated the next day as there was no way we could eat it that night.

We were sitting right in front of the door, so it was quite cold.  Two major reasons why I will not go back:\n1. We were told by a woman (possibly the owner) that the table in the back of the restaurant was being moved to combine with another table, so we couldn't sit there.  Well...that table sat open for about 15 minutes until they sat another (apparently more important) couple in that table.\n2. Later, another table opened up and we asked our waiter if we could move to that table.  He actually told us he needed to check with the owner because they might be saving it for \"VIPs.\"  We'll, my boyfriend and I both looked at each other and couldn't believe what we were told.  These people are so incredibly arrogant...\n\nThe waiter rarely checked on us...my boyfriend probably would have ordered another glass of wine had he ever come back and asked if he wanted more wine.\n\nI don't appreciate being lied to.  I don't care if you're the owner.  You can certainly give priority to your favorite customers if you know they are coming in later, but you should realize that you will likely lose prospective new repeat customers in the process.  \n\nWhile I did like the food enough to go back, it wasn't good enough to put up with that kind of treatment.  There are too many other great restaurants in the city that offer great food AND great service for a $150 meal for two.  \n\nWe won't be back.  You shouldn't, either.", "author": "Michelle C."}

The dish was pretty good, but I sense not quite as good as the seafood based dishes my friend was enjoying.

The taste is really like what you get in Italy, especially the pasta. The fresh linguine was the best we've ever had - it was as close to al dente as fresh pasta can get. We loved the squid ink linguine, oven roasted calamari and sardines. I wanted to love the octopus stew but the calamari blew it away. Ditto for the sea urchin pasta. The meal was nicely capped off with ricotta and saffron cake and gelati.\n\nI'm usually wary of squid cos of a bad incident when I was younger but I couldn't stop eating the oven roasted calamari! It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. It's hard to explain the wonderful flavours - just try it! You won't regret it ;-p\n\nWe love sardines and it's very hard to find them here. They tasted great. The only small problem is that there are pinbones so you have to chew carefully. All 3 appetizers had great sauces that we were mopping up with our bread :-)\n\nThe squid ink linguine was amazing. This is the only place I know that makes it with lemon zest (we're guessing; some lemony flavour) which makes it very bright tasting and easy to eat. Yum!\n\nThe sea urchin pasta was nice and creamy but I'm not a big fan of the tiny pasta grains. I was hoping for noodles.

Other options range from perfectly al dente spaghetti bottarga (spaghetti with cod roe) to pizza a sa sarda (tomato sauce, mozzarella, pecorino, capers, and oregano) with a slightly charred thin crust .\n\nThe extensive wine list features numerous selections by the glass, allowing you to rely on the expert advice of the staff to pair a different Sardinian wine with each dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-23", "description": "Perfect! that's how I can describe my dinner at \"La Ciccia\" (= the fat, in italian).  Let me tell ... my mother is from Sardinia, and so is half of my relatives. I had occasion to sample typical Sardinian food a countless number of times, many of which on Sardinian soil. \n \nA little premise ...\nFor those who ignore it, Sardinia had been some centuries under Spanish domination and their cuisine, as well as their language,  have been heavily influenced  by this experience. As far as food is concerned, you can notice it particularly on the fish or seafood dishes.\nNot so in their meat oriented dishes, which are really particular, even within an italian culture. For instance, they use a lot goat and suckling pig meat. Pecorino cheese and the (not-so-good -looking) cheese with worms are others among their culinary flags. \nEnd of the premise ...\n\n I already knew that I couldn't go wrong with this restaurant, but my high expectations have been even surpassed by the exceptional quality and original combination of flavours I got.  Heaven made food ... literally! The baby calamari with slightly spicy sauce were so wonderfully tender and juicy. The home made pastas, namely rigatoni with goat meat and funghi porcini rag\u00f9 and the spicy linguine with cured tuna roe  were arguably the best pasta dishes I got in SF so far and easily comparable to the best I had back in my home country.  \nI disagree with some yelpers on the bread: I find it fantastic.  Moreover this is an example of typical Sardinian bread, as typical as the flat one. \n\nActually, I wonder if they have ever made ricotta bread, another speciality of the region (Nice childhood memories :-) ) ... guys,  you should really try that one... I'll ask the cook, I bet he can add it to Ciccia's already  phenomenal menu.  \n\nAnd what about the desserts? another impressive demonstration of cooking mastery: goat cheese-figue, malaga (marsala and dried grapes) and olive oil ice-cream ... wow ... ricotta/lemon/saffron cake  ...\ndouble wow  (though I could not taste the saffron at all, but still amazing taste and consistency).\n\nAdd a good prosecco wine ...100$ (for two) but an experience to repeat as soon as possible. I guess you can hardly get better than this as far as rich flavours are concerned. \nImpeccable and friendly service.\n\nI'm in love. period.", "author": "Andrea L."}

It seems like the secret is already out, though.)\n\nI was looking for a nice place to take the little lady for her birthday and I had a few criteria that must be met for the restaurant.\n\n1. Good wine selection\n2. Small, quaint and family restaurant-ish.\n3. Great food\n4. Something different\n\nItem #1: was met easily by looking at their website.  I expected an awesome wine list when I walked in, but imagine my shock when I was handed the menu.  It's a fairly standard sized menu.  I'd say 11\"x17\" with your conventional Italian restaurant of appetizers, salads, pasta, main courses and dessert.  Now, flip it over and there are literally over 100 wines listed in three columns!  Bring your magnifier, because you'll need it to read the massive wine list!  Yeah, I'd say item# 1 was met, and then some.  They have a large selection of Sardinian wines, which I discovered pair fantastically with the food.  Don't guess on the wine.  Ask your server for a recommendation, since you're not likely to know most of the wines on the menu.\n\nItem# 2: The pictures on the website don't do it justice.  The place is small, with a nice window seating area, small bar and cozy feel to it.  You don't feel like you're going to accidentally eat your neighbor's meal, but it's definitely cozy and quaint.  A great place to celebrate your significant other's birthday.\n\nItem# 3: Neither of us had ever had Sardinian food before.  It has a definite Italian look and feel to it, but the cuisine is truly unique.  There are a lot of coastal type dishes featuring fish, shellfish and other yummy critters that inhabit the local waters.  I was impressed to see them proudly display that they use local produce whenever possible.  Be sure and pay attention when they tell you about the daily specials.  If I had thought ahead to stretch my stomach a bit (more,) I would have ordered them all!  I ordered the seared tuna and she had their braised lamb.  We had their homemade linguni pasta, a garden salad featuring an awesome beet reduction dressing, and amazing soft mozzerala, tomato and Sardinain flat bread appetizer and fresh fruit sherbet and an Amaretto almond cheesecake type dessert.  What a phenomenal meal!\n\nItem# 4: I've never been to Sardina.  I've read about it and even read about Sardinain native wine grape varieties.  Never had any Sardinain food either.  Whether you're a super adventurous eater or like to stick close to the beaten path, you're sure to love the food here.  you've probably never heard of most of the things on the menu, so don't be bashful about asking your waiter.  Everyone was super friendly and made us feel like we were visiting their home.  They made sure we felt at home and made sure our wine glasses were refilled.  This was a truly great dining experience and very different from your typical homestyle Italian , but close enough that you don't feel like you're jumping into the deep end.\n\nIf you're on welfare, this probably isn't the place for you.  If you like to eat, drink wine and breathe occasionally, you'll love this restaurant.  It's really hard to put into words what the experience of this place is like.  Get over there and try it for yourself.  La Ciccia is a smash hit!", "author": "Dave T."}

Overall it was a fantastic evening, and the food was both tasty and exciting. I love seafood, and this definitely met all of my expectations, and was even a bit too adventurous for my taste. The wine selection is really great, and our server helped us pick the right bottle for our meal. We started with the calamari appetizer and the baby octopus stew and both were amazing. The sauce on both dishes were so good we were sopping it up with the bread. We also ordered the olives, which were great. The calamari dish was my favorite thing that we ordered, and I've never had octopus cooked so well before. For my entree I ordered the spaghetti bottarga and it was really good, although it tasted kind of bitter (maybe from the olive oil?) My BF ordered the sea urchin dish and I didn't like the taste at all, although that's entirely because I don't like sea urchin. He thought it was delicious and rich, and finished the entire dish. For dessert we ordered the saffron and ricotta cakes, but I didn't particularly like them, they lacked a real identifiable flavor. We also wanted to get just one scoop of gelato but were told that it's a gelato trio, so it wouldn't be possible. I would definitely go there again, although I don't think most people that I know would be able to find something 'safe' enough on the menu. My one complaint is the lack of personal space. The restaurant is too small to fit as many tables as they do, and everyone is pushed together and the servers can barely walk in between them to take everyone's order. I'm sure space isn't an issue at the tables near the windows or against the walls, but being at a table in the center of the room kind of feels like being in the middle of rush hour traffic.", "author": "Regina L."}

When we first got there, the hostess took our coats and stored them for us, which we appreciated.  The hostess (possible owner) was extremely polite and we were very excited to try the food, which we had heard such great things about. Unfortunately, that was the best service we experienced tonight.\n\nAfter sitting down to review the menu, our waiter came several times asking for our orders. While the attention was initially appreciated, the service soon deteriorated to some of the worst I have ever experienced. \n\nWhen our waiter Antonio asked for our orders the final time, his curt manner made everyone feel rushed and uneasy. I placed my order and was helping my mother, who was having trouble seeing the menu, remember what she ordered. I realize he was likely busy, but instead of waiting he made snide remarks and rolled his eyes. Everyone at the table saw this and was uncomfortable. Everyone else in our party had unpleasant experiences while ordering as well. This was supposed to be a celebration. If he were just rude I would not have been so upset, but when my father asked for a good wine pairing for his dish -- not an unreasonable expectation at a nice restaurant with an exhaustive wine list -- he simply suggested a \"red wine.\" There is never an excuse to be rude, but it is especially aggravating when someone is rude and incompetent. I felt as if he was looking down on us the whole time, which I did not appreciate. I tried to ignore him and enjoy the time with my family, but throughout the meal he was defensive and rude. I didn't complain, but the server certainly overshadowed the entire meal.\n\nThat said, the food was quite good. It did taste authentic and was quite rich. I liked that they had food that was very Italian, but is absent from most traditional Italian restaurants. In addition, the busser was extremely polite. He really went out of his way to make sure our meal was enjoyable. I got the hint that he realized how rude the waiter was. I didn't like that you had to pay for olive oil for the bread, but understand this is common. They did give us a free dessert for my brother's birthday, which was very appreciated. \n\nAfter such poor service I will not be going back.", "author": "Maxwell W."}

Needless to say that most of reviews of La Ciccia are spot on from the thoughtful service throughout the evening to the fantastic recommendations of Sardinian fare (octopus stew, perfect calamari...(memory bank failure again)). \n \nThis is exactly what a neighborhood restaurant should be....proud to serve new and regulars and provide memorable service and quality and tasty cuisine.  Feels much like eating in Italy where you are welcomed into a family business for the evening.\n\nAnother nice feature is the 'bring your own wine' corkage program...bring own wine, pay corkage fee of $15? BUT if you buy another bottle on their list, the corkage disappears magically!\nOur server recommended the best Sardinian wine that did not break the bank and with the waived corkage it was practically free!

The pizza is fabulous, but the flat bread that i was expecting to be soft was a hard version. They have excellent pasta, and the Marsala raisin ice cream is very good. The wine list isn't bad, but needs more selection of California wine. The corkage fee for $35 dollars is outrageous, but if you buy one bottle there, then they waive the corkage fee.

I love the pasta with shrimp eggs the most, only the portion was little small. (Maybe I am a big eater)  The last but not the least was the Ahi.  I thought it would be a whole fish with bone in.  The staff claimed that customers complained about too much bone, so they start to serve with only the fillet.  That makes sense because if someone chok on the fish bone, there will be a lot responsiblities on the restaurant side.  \nDesert was ok, we had the Ricotta and Saffron Cake served with honey and Almonds.  \n\nServices were great, the waiter constantly come back to check on us.

It's different than the standard heavy cheesy creamy pasta dishes you generally find - instead you get smaller dishes with awesome ingredients, lots of seafood, simple yet flavorful.  If you find simple food boring and don't know how to appreciate the nuances of delicate Sardinian cooking, you'd do very well ordering the Mama's Trio at Macaroni Grill (a place I also enjoy, but under very different circumstances).

We were set to eat in Potrero Hill, but later decided to eat in Noe Valley due to the insane traffic on 280. Needless to say, it was an excellent choice. It was my first time having Sardinian food, but I'm intrigued to try more. Sardinia definitely differentiates itself from Italy with their use of fresh seafood in their dishes.\n\nThe scene:\n\nLa Ciccia is a cute little Sardinian restaurant filled with loud conversations and an impressive selection of wine. They have a limited menu filled with pastas, pizzas, and seafood; but, it's one of those places that makes a set amount of dishes and makes them well.\n\nService is outstanding. When we received our bread (although cold) prior to our meal, we asked a busboy if there was olive oil or butter to go with it. He kindly informed us that Sardinians do not use butter in their dishes and that if we want olive oil, it'll cost us $2. We were shocked they'd charge anything for oil, so we declined the offer. Just a few moments later, the owner of the restaurant stopped by and gave us a little dish of oil for free.\n\nThe food:\n\nI was craving pasta, but everything on the menu was a little out of my comfort zone. They had pasta with unusual ingredients such as bottarga (cured fish roe) and squid ink. The waiter urged that I'd try the fresh spaghetti with spicy oil and bottarga and I did. It was incredibly delicious, especially with the homemade pasta.\n\nFresh spaghetti with spicy oil and bottarga - I couldn't believe I ordered a dish with cured fish roe and liked it! The flavor combination in this dish was amazing. The salty ocean-ness from the bottarga combined with the spiciness of the chili flakes. Put that together with the fresh, al dente spaghetti, and you have a home run.\n\nFresh rigatoni with lamb ragu - If I didn't get the bottarga spaghetti, I would've ordered this dish. K ordered it and literally could not put the fork down. The sauce was rich in tomato and lamb flavor.\n\nFregula with seafood and squid ink sauce - It was my first time ever having squid ink. I was surprised the ink itself really had no flavor. The dish was no doubt, unique though.\n\nRicotta and saffron cake served with honey and almonds - The cake, similar to a sponge cake, was extremely light and crumbly. It's the perfect dessert if you're completely stuffed from your main dish.\n\nSelection of 3 ice creams (fig and goat cheese, olive oil, and cherry and marsala) - By far, the most interesting flavors of ice cream I've ever had. All very unique and light in flavor, nothing overbearing. I couldn't get enough of the fig and goat cheese as well as the olive oil ice creams.", "author": "Sam L."}

If it is cold night, try to get a table towards the front and over to the side, out of the draft.  They must have had the back door propped open to keep the kitchen cool.

The place seems always packed, and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny.\n\nGrilled calamari - perfectly cooked, sauce was addicting. We used the bread and soaked up all the sauce. :)\n\nSpaghetti with Bottarga - no fishiness at all, nicely cooked al dente pasta. If you stick to this dish, it is mild and spicy at the same time. If you start eating something else that is more flavorful though, this dish can become somewhat bland. Be careful!\n\nSeared lamb tenderloin - amazing! Great flavor, and such tender slices of lamb. Pretty big portion! \n\nRicotta and Saffron cake - didn't realize how strong the saffron flavor could be! Even still, very tasty and light. The honey and almonds were perfect matches for this cake.\n\nThis place is a gem, hidden in the outskirts of noe valley. Glad to have tried this restaurant!", "author": "Carol L."}

We asked one of our server if we can take a picture for our anniversary, she was super nice and didnt hesistate to take a picture of us.

So I was delighted when we rolled up to this warm, unpretentious neighborhood restaurant.  I had never had sardinian food before - its superb!  The combinations of flavors and textures were sometimes surprising but at the same time comforting and unfussy.\n\nThe octupus was tender and tasty but the sauce didn't the blow me away.  Our main course, petrale sole, was simple and impeccable.  The fregula, though - holy cannoli.  I was a bit concerned about the tuna heart aspect, but the little slivers of savory , flavorful cured tuna perfectly complement the slightly lemony ricotta and toothsome pasta.  It's unique and delicious and I insist that you order it.  The ricotta-saffron cake was also fantastic - light and moist, the coolness of the ricotta balanced by the warmth of toasted almonds and honey.  \n\nNow I can't wait to visit Sardegna.

I'm a fan of anchovies and sardines, but the pasta with cured tuna heart took that flavor to a whole other level. It was tasty, but something I couldn't eat more than once a year...intense. The shrimp with garlic and tomato was also delicious and cam with an unadvertised mound of creamy polenta that was a perfect vehicle for the sauce. \n\nThey have a very extensive Italian wine list, with some great and unusual finds.

Those terms, plus 4.5 stars on hundreds of reviews get me in the mood to make my O face at dinner.  Got to make my O face alright, but at La Ciccia, O stands for \"overrated\".\n\nRight off the bat, they committed the first cardinal sin of hospitality: seated us, then left us sitting for a long period without getting a drink order. I don't know if it was 5 minutes or 15, but when you're sitting empty handed at an expensive restaurant, few things cast a pall over a meal like that. It's simply inexcusable. The next inexcusable thing is their drinks menu. All unrecognizeable Italian reds, plus a handful of Sardinian beers. The wines seem to be decent value, with lots of $40-50 dollar bottles.  The beers, in case you're curious, START at 14 bucks and go to 22 (!). For ONE bottle, normal size, of beer. Seriously. Inexcusable. Again. Some of us simply don't care for a big belly full of acid and sugar that comes with wine, and gravitate to cocktails. Lacking a liquor license due to the California nanny state? Fine. Stock some decent beers and we'll make do. I mean seriously, who the fuck decides to offer 20 dollar bottles of beer? Everybody knows Italian beer sucks. Get a goddamn keg of Lagunitas back there. The quality will double and the value will quadruple. Ive honestly never even seen such a thing.\n\nWell now we're seated at least, with a drink in hand. Even if it is a 10 dollar glass of wine I never wanted in the first place. \n\nBartender chick brings a basket of bread out. Sliced. Like out of a bag from Safeway. With nothing else. She pulls her disappearing act again, so I have to wait another several minute stretch to ask for a bit of olive oil. Turns out, that's another 2 bucks. Well that's pretty lame, but the Safeway sourdough in the basket needs some help. So I suck it up and order a side of olive oil. Now I know it's only two bucks, but having to pay for that puts me in the same mood as having to pay for a blanket on a plane. That mood can best be described as \" Wow, fuck this business, I'll never patronize it again!\"\n\n  Food comes. Went with all the favorites from fellow yelpers. Roast Calamari, Sardines, Octopus stew. Every single thing was SO FUCKING SALTY we could barely eat it. Now I know you're wondering at this point where my taste buds lie. Let me assure you that  significant fractions of my caloric intake come in the form of M&G's bacon cheeseburgers, Sinaloa carnitas tacos, and Phuy Hyung Pho. So me and salt are old and dear friends. But THIS PLACE, La Ciccia, is like trying to kill us with the stuff. \n\nBy this time, I'm so grotesquely bloated with salt and wine that I honestly just cant wait to get the bill and leave. The bartender chick looks at me like I'm deformed when she clears my barely touched plates.  That's right honey, 4.5 stars on Yelp may bring in the customers, but lots of us will wait to make our own judgements. If that means leaving 50 bucks worth of food on my plate rather than have a hypertensive coronary, then that's MY call.\n\nLike a previous poster said so eloquently, the best part of my experience here was leaving.", "author": "Alex D."}

Octopus stew will win over anyone and everyone, tender and juicy.  We shared the Spaghetti with Bottarga and was not disappointed. There is such a robust meaty/cheese flavor that just sticks with each bite. Didn't have room for any desserts but we will be back as there were so many dishes that I need to try.

The dining room is intimate and charming, and you can tell that many of the customers are regulars.  \n\nAs an Italian, food is everything to me. Most of my memories with family and friends is punctuated by the perfect dish, new flavor or experience.  Food is obviously important to the owners of La Ciccia, as I could taste the love of their country in every bite. During the course of the meal, the streets of  San Francisco faded away, and I was transported to the coast of Sardinia. \n\nOur  appetizer was the perfect beginning to the evening. Five squids, (their bulbs the size of endives!) were laid out on a platter and drizzled with olive oil and seasonings.  For an entree, I had the fregula with squid ink and my boyfriend had pasta with shaved tuna heart.  Forgive me for not providing details, but the food was so good that we ate it too quickly!  Dessert was spectacular as well. We ordered a sampling of three gelati, which is made special for their restaurant. That evening we had one scoop each of mulled wine, goat cheese and saffron gelato.  The flavors were surprising, unique and sublime. \n\nThe bread served at the table is heartier than what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. It's good for soaking up sauce, but not as satisfying for nibbling before a meal.  Do as the regulars do and order the Sardinian flat bread. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and even the owner came by to see how we enjoyed our meal.

Nothing we had was anything you couldn't easily make at home.  Maybe that's not what you look for at a restaurant where dinner for three with wine runs $250, but it is what I look for.  Nothing innovative is going on here.  There is far better italian to be had in SF (literally dozens of places come to mind in fact).\n\nThe place is a small hole in the wall with cramped tables and constant draft running through it, which is fine, i am not downgrading the experience for that, but just so you know.  I like holes in the wall with drafts when the food is good. The food was average. I will say though the service was excellent and the owners really do seem to love their little spot and their customers.  So there's that.  \n\nApps: decent, nothing out of this world.  Had the prosciutto special.  Can get same from any store, but it was tasty.  Octopus stew was good, but not remarkable.  A spices tomato broth with little octopi in it.  Different, but once you get over the \"otherness\" its something you could easily make at home.  \n\nPasta: had the rigatoni veal and goat ragout special.  Meh.  Sauce was too dry to balance the al dente-ness of the pasta.  Again, you could make this at home no problem.\n\nMains:  Pork and lamb.  Here they fell flat.  The lamb was uninspired and bland at points. i barely ate a third of it.   The pork was done in the style of a veal cutlet, super thin, breadcrumbs on top, and ok.  Again, could do all this at home.\n\nDessert: Can't really remember, something rice pudding-ish and a second chocolate dish.  Actually was tasty, but not enough to make the rest of the meal better.\n\nWine:  They have a deep list, but the two bottles we got were meh.  A white that held its consistency for about ten minutes and then just basically fell apart, and a red which was moderately corked which we debated sending back but decided wasn't so bad that we had to pull the obnoxious customer lever.  These were both recommended by people at the restaurant.\n\nConclusion: its a decent neighborhood spot, which I think is what they always intended, but it does not follow through on the hype its gotten in recent months.  I don't see the need to go back with all the other italian options in town.", "author": "EZ R."}

No complaint about these, but they were the least outstanding part of the meal.  I prefer the grilled sardines at 54 Mint.\n\nI stole a few bites of my friend's Malloreddus a sa Campidanese (semolina gnochetti).  Good stuff, not quite to the level of Ristorante Bacco's gnocchi -- but maybe that's an apples-to-oranges comparison, as the latter is made from potatoes.\n\nMy main course was Pezza de Angioni cun Cipudda a su Zaffaranu (seared lamb), served with an unusual (for me) bean/pea concoction on the side.  The sauce reminded me of a milder, subtler version of good ol' American BBQ. Delicioso and satisfying.\n\nThe wine we chose wasn't available, which was just as well since I mistakenly brought my Sicilian cheat sheet and the extensive wine list is largely Sardinian (so I was pretty much shooting in the dark).

The space is cozy and cute, but man, tables are really crammed together.  I was seated maybe a foot away from my neighbors... awkward!  I was also bumped quite a few times by staff as they walked back and forth from the kitchen.  Acoustics are not the greatest-- as the restaurant filled up it got harder and harder to have a conversation across the table.  \n\nSERVICE:  Very friendly.  I loved how transparent our server was re: prices of items too.  Usually I feel like restaurant staff will tell you everything about a menu item except for how much it costs.  Not so at La Ciccia.  Highly appreciated.  Our server was also so patient when I was choosing my drink, and allowed me to sample a few to help me decide.\n\nFOOD: \n- Burrata and crispy flat bread ($13):  A special of the day.  I wasn't impressed, but I'm also not a huge cheese person.\n- Stewed baby octopus ($12):  The soup was very flavorful, but the octopus wasn't cleaned very well-- I got several pieces that were gritty and sandy... it was quite unpleasant.\n- Fregola with seafood sugo and squid ink ($17):  I liked this dish.  It included lemon zest or something citrusy that really brightened the entire dish.  Very flavorful, and the seafood sugo was soooo tender, even after reheating the next day.  Portion size was ginormous... definitely a shareable dish.\n- Fuseli with sea urchin and tuna heart ($17):  JF's dish.  Very fishy (from the sea urchin) and RICH.  I tried a bite-- definitely preferred my own pasta dish.\n- Ricotta and saffron cake ($8):  Hands down my favorite dish of the night.  The cake was light and airy, and can you believe this, JUICY.  How is that possible?  Whatever voodoo Sardinian magic they used... man that cake was so good.\n\nOVERALL: Cute neighborhood restaurant.

From the baby octopus stew to the ravioli of the day, we embarked on a Sardinian culinary safari tonight.  And everything was delicious.\n\nOur meal began with a white wine from La Ciccia's extensive list.  We took the recommendation of the owner and weren't disappointed but we were surprised by the wine--in a good way.  We started with a frisee salad, some salumi, and the off the charts amazing baby octopus stew.  Following this, we had a pizza with mushrooms, prosciutto, mozzarella and rosemary olive oil.  Add to that the ravioli stuffed with potato, pecorini and mint and topped with a goat ragu.  \n\nWe had the lamb, tuna and mussels, and pork tenderloin as our second courses.  The lamb may have been the best preparation I've ever had.  Paired with the side of spicy wilted spinach, it was nearly perfect.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the trio of gelatos: marsala, almond, and goat cheese and fig.  Each of us had a different favorite, but they were all wonderful.\n\nLa Ciccia was an unknown restaurant to me before tonight, but now I will happily recommend it to anyone.  Thanks for a fantastic meal.  And thanks to my friends Renee and Yasu for inviting me!", "author": "Todd X."}

No complaints at all.\n\nFirst we tried the special appetizer. Chicken livers and gizzards in a hearty, creamy sauce. Not for everyone, but we loved it.\n\nNext we had the fresh sardines.

My wife and I had a great meal there, but it was just short of 5 stars. The baby octopus stew was as good as advertised -- tender octopus with a soup/stew that was spicier than I had expected. I really liked the kick, and used all my bread to get every last bit of it. The gnochetti was also delicious -- good texture, well-cooked -- and the pork ragu was meaty and not too heavy. We also had the lamb loin that was very well cooked, but could've used a little bit more seasoning. The lamb also came with broccoli, which I am not a fan of, and it was a bit unfortunate that the waiter told us that the vegetable would be a surprise, even though he mentioned multiple vegetable options that day. The service is what probably dings them down a star. The service was very nice, but got less attentive as the meal went on, especially when we had to wait a long time to get the check.

Parking is a bit tricky -- I had to shark for about 15 minutes before I found something a few blocks a way.  So if you have a reservation, make sure you plan to get there a little early.  Making a reservation is key -- this place was packed to the gills on a Saturday night.  It was so crowded I couldn't even get in the front door to meet my girlfriend at our table without pushing through throngs of people.  The tables at this place are close together, and the overall space is small.  Because of this, it was super loud.  If you're a highly sensitive person and loud conversation bothers you, this isn't a good place for you.\n\nOn to the food and drink: Being completely unfamiliar with almost every wine on the extensive wine list, our waiter suggested a couple of things based on our tastes.  I asked for something a bit spicy, and he nailed it.  There is a $25 corkage fee if that's relevant.\n\nThey brought out some sliced bread which was obviously fresh but not that tasty.  With no butter or balsamic, it was barely worth eating.  We ordered a beet salad with some kind of cheese -- which tasted like beets and was okay (I'm not a huge beets fan).  We also ordered the calamari appetizer, which was fantastic -- one of the better calamari dishes I've ever had.  At this point, we started dipping the bread in the calamari dish juice because it was so scrumptious we didn't want to leave all the sauce uneaten.\n\nFor main dish, I had the seared ahi with a light olive sauce.  It was pretty good, but not phenominal.  My girlfriend had the lamb, which was literally the best lamp I have ever had in my life.  It was cooked just right, it was juicy, and there was lots of it.  If we ever go back, I am getting the lamb without hesitation.\n\nOverall, I can easily give this place a 5 stars based on the food.  However, I'm knocking off a star overall for the ambiance -- it was just a little too crowded, too loud, and there were too many times that I got inadvertently jostled during the meal.  A fine meal overall, and we'll return again.", "author": "Alex P."}

The food is very good.\n\nWe arrived early as I figured it would be hard to find parking, but someone was pulling out just across the street, so we ended up being 10 minutes early. They were able to seat us right away. I take .5 off for service. We were seated right away, given menus and water immediately, but it was at least 15 minutes until they came to even get our drink order. They were good about coming back to refill our wine and water throughout the night.\n\nWe ordered a salad (special that night) and the flatbread to start and it came out very quickly. My husband said the salad was fine, but nothing special (I don't know why he even bothers to get salad!) and the flatbread was good, but it was huge. I feel like we just ate the top layer and it's not really something you can take with you :) My husband preferred the regular bread they served. I ordered the octopus stew, which as everyone else has said, was excellent. The octopus were perfectly cooked and the sauce was divine - loved the little kick it had. Great to use the bread to soak it up.\n\nIt was an oddly long wait between the starters and the main though, especially since the starters came so fast. Finally our dishes came, my husband ordered the gnocchetti (sp?) and I ordered the spaghittusu which is also a house specialty. Both were very good. I enjoyed mine, but it was a bit rich/heavy after what else I had eaten and it got very oily at the end so I left just a little. We were way too full for dessert.\n\nAnother issue with the service - dishes are left long after you're finished. Even after they were removed, it took a while for the waiter to come back around to see if we wanted dessert, and then finally, to bring, and then bring back the charged check.\n\nOverall, the food is very good and it's an authentic Italian environment where the staff is speaking Italian to each other. Service was far from appalling but as listed above, could be improved a bit. While the menu isn't that big, I think we'd come back for the specialties I had and really enjoyed.

It's Italian yes but it doesn't consist of thick tomato sauces, an endless bowl of pasta and parmesan cheese piled high. Sardinian cuisine consists of seafood cooked with complimentary seasoning and light sauces that breaths freshness through the dish.\n\nI was how much I liked the octopus stew that featured octopus in a spicy tomato. The spiciness complimented the freshness of the octopus. You must try the spaghetti with bottarga caviar; it was out of this world! It's tossed in a spicy oil dressing that was light and as I slurped it down, it didn't feel like I d used a stick of butter as a chap stick. Instead of thick crusted pizza, they serve it brick oven style keeping the sauce light, the pizza sarda was a generous helping of pecorino, capers, onions and oregano. The tender lamb chops were seared perfectly and inside had a nice color. For desert we had the selection of sardinian cheeses with honey. There's complimentary bread but try the flat bread and dip it in the sauces of each dish, I was skeptical about their wine list but it turned out to be quite extensive. \n\nQuaint restaurant you could walk right by without knowing but pray that you don't. The decor is very minimal with very dim lights making it perfect for a romantic date.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful in explaining how each dish is cooked.

Without a reso, you are definitely in for a wait, but conveniently you can walk across the street to their wine bar La Nebbia- the service from the bar staff is exceptionally welcoming. I had my eyes set on 3 things on the menu at La Ciccia before we even ordered, and I was happy when the bartender at La Nebbia re-affirmed my choices. \n\nThe Calamarusu to start, was fantastic. 5 whole Monterey squids grilled perfectly, soft and tender, and finished with basil oil. I could eat 2 rounds of that if you let me. Pasta Longa e su Nieddu de Seppia- the linguine was cooked to al dente and tossed in the rich, sea flavor of squid ink. Loved it. Last, the dish I was most looking most forward to was the Fregua Sarda cun Arrizzonisi e Cori de Tonnu; toasted Fregola pasta with urchin, tomato and topped with shaved cured tuna heart. Anything urchin has a special place in my heart, and this dish unfortunately didn't play out as well as I had hoped. The sauce was lush and sweet with uni, creamy and perfect with the slight acid of the tomato and the gaminess of the the tuna heart, but the fregola wasn't ideal to me in holding up to the sauce. Textures were all soft, and to me the sauce was screaming to be paired with a noodle pasta that brought bite and texture. But all in all, flavors were simple and delicious, and I'm looking forward to the next visit to try some other dishes on their menu.", "author": "F S."}

I admired the passion with which they spoke about their food and they spent nearly 2.5 hours after their closing time to accommodate us. \n\nSardinian food is extremely rich, and although the dishes were presented very simply, the flavors were amazing. I started with the heirloom tomato salad, which was so good I couldn't even spare a second to speak. We also had the calamari, which was so tender and came in a delicious broth that made for a fantastic sauce for dipping bread in. For my main entree, I went with the tasty Semolina Gnochetti with pork sugo and pecorino, which was the perfect amount. I didn't feel stuffed, even after trying to eat half of my dining companion's braised boar while he wasn't looking. \n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed a variety of gelato, which after spending an afternoon at a chocolate festival, completely maxed out my sugar intake for the rest of the month.

His selection paired well with the dishes we had. We also managed to try two other amazing reds, a prosecco to start and a dessert wine to complete our evening. \n\nLet's just say I was happily full by the end of the night.

The decor is easy on the eye and makes the place romantic for a nice dinner out. I wish the interior could have made up for the food of the place.\n\nLet's start with the appetizer. It was a sort of minced beef dish in a creamy tomato sauce. I held my opinion until we left La Cicca, but it might as well have been dog food. That's right. Dog Food. It might as well been taken from a can, scooped out onto a ceramic dish, served to us, and then billed for $15. The other calamari appetizer was good, but the dog food dish stayed with me for the rest of the meal. I regretted listening to the server since he recommended the DF dish, but honestly, I can't remember what the rest of the meal tasted like but it ok. \n\nPros: The server was nice. He answered question quickly and was very nice. The food came out pretty fast. \n\nCons: $15 dog food.

This small restaurant recently got uber props from Michael Bauer and I think they're overwhelmed. We had 8:30pm reservations and could not be seated a minute before. It was nearly a 1/2 hr before our appetizers of thick cuts of fresh mozzarella w/roasted veggies (a bit pedestrian) and a pesto/potato/pancetta pizza came out (mmm WOW).  \r\n\r\nI had the evening special of lamb chops w/a chopped mint/olive oil drizzling - medium rare per chef's choice - MMM SO TASTY. The 2 galpals across the table from me, finished their baked sea bass, and braised tuna entrees before I'd even looked up (I GUESS it was good). Thus I only got to try a small bite of hangar steak of the buddy next to me; also chef's choice medium rare, also YUM.  \r\n\r\nIt was something of a belated bday celebration tonite, and our waitress brought out a lemon zest & saffron ricotta dessert, w/a candle for my friend. I nippled on the trio of cheese plate (who loves cheese? ME!) and AGAIN those 2 on the other side gobbled their chocolate ice cream/cake before I could taste it. GRRR.\r\n\r\nThough the entire meal went over 2hrs, the staff was sooo so nice, and helpful throughout.

Parking can be a bit difficult as it's adjacent to a residential area.\n\nStarters: grilled calamari, salume, and octopus stew. The calamari was pretty good, not too rubbery. The sauce is good to mop up with your bread. The salume was sliced super thin and spread over a large plate. Good with the table bread as they charge $2 for EVOO and will not bring you butter. In fact, he said Sardinian cuisine doesn't really use butter. My favorite was the octopus stew. Very tender, almost meaty baby octopus in a flavorful slightly spicy tomato stew. Delicious.\n\nEntrees: I had the petrale filet. Soooo good, very delicate and flaky. Cooked to perfection and served on a small bed of greens. My friends ordered various pasta dishes, which were all pretty good. I just can't get myself to order pasta at an Italian restaurant, even it it's home-made.\n\nFor dessert, we quickly split a trio of gelati: Saffron, goat cheese, and malaga (kinda like rum raisin). They were all pretty good, although the goat cheese one was a bit odd and kinda sour. I liked the malaga the most.\n\nWe didn't have any wine, but if you flip over the menu, your eyes will cry when they see the 7pt font wine list completely covering the entire back side. lol!

The meat was so tender, delicious and fresh. There were no side dishes to the fish, it was served plainly.\n\nWe paired all this with a Sardinian wine selected by the owner of the restaurant and bought for us by a friend who had recommended this place! Talk about treatment!\n\nIt was a Isola dei Nuraghi which was 100% Carignano. It was not overwhelmingly complex so my wife didn't suffer eating her fish but it was not too simple either and complemented my lamb perfectly. \n\nAfter all this, we had room for desert since we had foregoed our Primi, and we were glad we did that in the end. We shared a trio of ice cream which was amazing and another dessert which had a frozen core and a thin layer of cake around it.\n\nOverall, we had great food and wished if we could come back one more time before our SF weekend getaway ended.

I really would love to give it more because I love the \"idea\" of the restaurant but honestly everything tonight was so \"blah\" and \"whatever\" that I wouldn't recommend any friends to go there. \n\nI was impressed because the restaurant was crowded - on a Saturday night, the tables were all full and there was a steady stream of customers coming in. We were looking forward to eating here b/c the owners are from Sardegna and our best friend studied there and is of native Italian origin so we figured we'd love it and while the ambiance was totally there and the watistaff were all super warm and friendly, the food just... wasn't and when it comes down to it, the reason why I eat out is to get better tasting food than what I make at home and all the food tonight was pretty bland and in general it was \"whatever.\" A totally non-memorable meal.\n\nHere's the rundown: \n\nWine list - definitely gets an A - lots of variety and plenty to choose from in all price ranges - we had a bottle of a great Prosecco followed by a native Sardegna red (didn't pick it, so not sure what we got) - both bottles together cost $80. \n\nApps:\n\n1. We ordered a special \"ricotta\" cheese made with cow's milk which was bland and tasteless - it came with \"crostinis\" but when we got the plate, it was a dollop of cheese in the middle with two toasted crostinis and olive oil drizzled around it - all around this didn't taste like much, it needed some roasted red pepper or sun dried tomatoes to give it a little \"oomph\" - alas... \n\n2. We also ordered the Seafood Salad which was fine - the fish all tasted good and seemed fresh. The flavorings here were bland as well but it was fine I guess. \n\n3. Prosciutto slices - I don't eat ham but my husband says it was decent, but unremarkable.\n\nMain courses - \n\nThe restaurant is a tad loud so I'm going to say that maybe the waiter didn't hear but one of our guests ordered a special homemade squid ink tagliarini but the waiter didn't hear her properly and put in the wrong order, we were told it would be just a minute to get the right dish and it took between 5-10 minutes... not great, but hey, these things happen. \n\nThe wild boar stew looked very meaty - basically it looked like a plate of meat with a tiny dollop of cabbage next to it - would've been good to get some veggies in there... \n\nMy husband had lamb chops (based on the recommendations we saw on Yelp) but he also felt it was very mediocre.\n\nI had a Fruega (spelling maybe Freuga?) - it was a larger size grain-type of pasta in the couscous family - it was okay taste-wise, not the most delicious thing I've ever had but I like the consistency of the pasta grain even if the taste was mediocre. \n\nI think one of the big reasons why I'm giving it 2 stars is because my expectations were set fairly high from reading the other Yelp reviews here so think of this as a favor as I set your expectations on the low side :) - otherwise I'd probably give it 3 stars, but definitely no more than that. \n\nI liked the fact that this was a neighborhood restaurant and really liked the friendliness of the staff, with the chef, maitre d' amongst waiters who were friendly and stopped by our table to say hi, I just wish the food tasted better...", "author": "Heather F."}

Also there isn't a bartender back there to chat with, this space is used more as an extension of the kitchen with staff rotating in and out.\n\nIf I hear that they've done something to mediate the noise, I would like to come back to this place, but not before then.", "author": "RiCH K."}

It really made me feel like I had some family in Sardinia! The server gloriously told us the daily specials, and had my mouth watering before she even finished telling us the specials!\n\nThe decor was very quaint, but not stuffy looking. It was a very comfortable setting, and had a very nice European feel to it.\n\nWe had the sardine appetizer, and I must say, it was delicious! I'm somewhat of a sardine snob, and I was genuinely impressed. \n\nWhat really impressed me was the Botarga pasta; as a successful internet entrepreneur, I am used to eating lot's of pasta while wined and dined by my clients. Too often, have I eaten overcooked fluffy pasta that the American's think is \"Just Right.\" The pasta at La Ciccia, to me was perfect. Not too heavy, and just enough portions.\n\nWill I come back?

Also, my friend who was a vegetarian didn't want any of the octopus appetizer but the waiter came over and started serving her a portion- when she said, 'no thank you, I don't want any',  he said 'oh sure you do, of course you do, and heaped it on her plate anyway....'

We wandered in to La Ciccia last night, quite by chance, as another restaurant we were intending to try appeared to be defunct.  Crowded yes, but there was an empty table back by the kitchen, and except for the constant annoying clinking of the chain screen separating the kitchen from the dining room, this was just fine.  \n\nTo digress on the chain curtain for a moment, who in their right mind would use chain to separate a kitchen and a dining room?   The constant clinking was not just for our benefit, as you could surely hear it halfway to the front door.  I didn't check the restroom, but wouldn't be surprised to find wind chimes there.\n\nSelf-righteous indignation aside, the food here is great, and especially good for seafood fans.  Orata was offered in both a fillet and whole fish, and having opted to look my fish straight in the eye before consuming it,  I was treated to a succulent and flavorful fish that was mine to de-bone.  At $25, this was a bit pricey compared to my wife's $13 seafood pasta dish (also delicious), but darn good nonetheless.\n\nLa Ciccia has an extensive wine list, and if you aren't deep into Italian wines, much less Sardinian wines, the staff provides wonderful guidance.  Even better, the by-the-glass list is also substantial, with at least 15 different selections that should satisfy most tastes and food combinations. \n\nThe Sardinian cheese plate for dessert was delightful, with a dollop of saffron honey on the side to add an aromatic sweetness to the savory fare.  Other people were raving about a ricotta and saffron dish, which I think Mr. Cranky described in his review below (Mr. C deserves honorable mention for most comprehensive review of La C to date).\n\nService was excellent, and the proprietor was warm and engaging.  This is the kind of place that draws you back.  I'd suggest making a reservation, with a specific request not to be seated next to the chainmail kitchen door.", "author": "Hugh B."}

The lamb was very rare but if you're ok with that quite delicious. They both could have been served hotter.\n\nThe starters were meh: The grilled sardines were fresh but on the large side and could have been grilled another 5 minutes to make them crispy. The clams were served in a soupy, oily broth and while fresh were also unremarkable.\n\nThe waiters were cold and snooty. It was like being in France, they're ok if you don't mind being patronized, but don't let them think you think you know anything about food.\n\nThere's not a lot of ambience.

I've probably been here around a dozen times, and the experience is always consistently wonderful.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Sardinia, it's a island province of Italy. As a result, the food centers around seafood, with many of the fresh ingredients integrated directly into the sauce of their pasta dishes, not to mention served on their own, for example, in their extremely tasty warm seafood salad starter.\n\nI generally ignore the entire menu and just listen to the specials for the day and choose from that. I'm especially a big fan of their pastas, and some notable dishes from the past: spaghetti with tuna heart or bottarga, or most recently, one that integrated tuna, tuna heart, and sea urchin in the sauce--really amazing.\n\nThe service is what you would expect from a neighborhood favorite. Lorella greats everyone with a warm smile and knows many customers by name (just go there twice and you too can become a regular).

I think it makes this dish a lot more approachable if you're not into eating these little 8 legged creatures - the tomato sauce really tones down the oceany taste of the octopus.  For my main course I had the spaghetti with the spicy olive oil and bottarga.   I had to look up what bottarga was and according to Wikipedia, it is a \"delicacy of cured fish roe.\"  It sounded unappealing - I don't usually like roe (I hate how they squish in your mouth, it weirds me out), but I thought everyone else on yelp seemed to like it so why not!  Turns out after I took a bite of this al dente (like the real kind you get in Italy) spaghetti and bit into the roe shavings dusted heavily onto the spaghetti, I instantly recognized the flavor.  So much for novelty!  Either way, the bottarga spaghetti is a very simple but great tasting dish - the mild spiciness of the olive oil is a nice compliment to the heaviness of the bottarga (which by the way isn't fishy or roe-y at all).  The portion sizing was just right for the appetizer and the spaghetti.  It was not too much but not too little - I managed to finish both dishes without feeling like I had to be rolled out of the restaurant.  \n\nAs for the little details - the restaurant is very narrow and the tables spaced fairly close to each other.  It's not very loud at all however which I appreciate - I don't like feeling like I'm at dinner with everyone in the room.  Parking might be a bit of an issue in evenings when you're competing for spaces with the local residents coming home from work but I managed to find a space just fine.  The food comes out pretty quickly and the service is pretty friendly.  One of the restaurant owners even came by at the end of our meal to ask us how it was.  Overall, I think SPQR still might be my favorite Italian restaurant in the city but I think if you're looking for decent traditional Italian food served Sardinian (note Sardinian = lots of seafood) style, this is the place to be.  I also think this is a good place to go if you don't really like seafood but like Italian food and want to be tricked into liking seafood.", "author": "Jean A."}

The tuna heart had the sharper, more distinctive taste.

Grape must was the thick, sweet + sour sauce that went over it.\n\nDessert:  The head chef, Massimilian (what a name! and the friendliest smile), came out to see how we were doing.  I told him how much we loved the pasta, and he recommended we try the bottarga gelato.  Double-take.  How could we not?  In the end, it didn't taste much like bottarga, more like a salted caramel.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "La Ciccia is one of those places that makes me glad to live in San Francisco. \n\nWe are regulars here and have been so since the first week they opened. We come for the warm welcome we get when we arrive, the excellent service, and the visit and chat with Massimiliano, the chef.\n\nOh, and because coming to La Ciccia saves us plane fare for having to travel to Italy to eat. Because La Ciccia is nearly as good as anything I have had over there.\n\nThis food is authentic, hearty, simple, and soulful. I was originally seduced by Spaghetti with caulifower and bottarga (roe), which used to be a regular dish on the menu. I mean, cauliflower, how basic can you get? But this dish was perfectly prepared, and the spaghetti was unusually good. When I asked about the spaghetti, I was told they get it from someone who makes it fresh for them in South City. I don't know if too many restaurants that go to the trouble of getting pastas like spaghetti fresh - most renditions are dried and right out of the box. But La Ciccia sweats the details, and the results are always good and sometimes glorious.\n\nFor example, the raviolis I had last week. They were a special, and possibly the best first course I have ever eaten, either in Italy or here in the US. Pasta gloriously silky smooth, sauce beautifully spiced, dish as a whole just perfection. I asked Massimiliano why it wasn't on the menu all the time and he said, \"well, it's a lot of work.\" I had to laugh at that, but the results showed. The ravioli were preceded by a lovely lentil soup, not as spectacular, but hearty, and a huge portion, too. What a beuatiful meal, as good as any I've ever had over in Italy.\n\nThere have been many highs for us over the last couple of years at La Ciccia. The wild boar. The octopus appetizer so lavishly praied in other reviews. Pizza a sa Sarda. The gnochetti. The pork stew. Fish. Very few lows - about the only dish I have had here that I did not care for was the Margherita Pizza. \n\nWe don't go out for Italian food very often because I do it pretty well myself at home. But it's a pleasure having this wonderful little place open in our area to give me an easy way out when I don't feel like doing it myself. There are some wonderful Italian restaurants in this City, but we keeping coming back to La Ciccia over, and over, and over again.", "author": "David G."}

La Ciccia is this adorably cosy Sardinian restaurant tucked alongside a slew of new restaurants burgeoning at the end of Church, but something was off that night.  I'm not sure whether it was the cramped little table that our waitress bumped into every time another waiter passed by to go to the kitchen (which was quite frequently) or the lack luster pasta/main dishes or both, but it just didn't do it for me.  \n\nI wasn't too impressed with my hanger steak, which was doused in a dark brown porcini sauce or the side of the gluttous mochi-like mashed potatoes (taste was fine, the texture...eh...not pretty).  The dessert of gelato covered in sweetened strawberries was just mediocre.\n\nHowever, the super tender calamari in a soupy mint & garlic sauce and their chianti from their eclectic wine menu were both delicious.   My bf loved his mint-encrusted lambchops, which I had to say was pretty dman good and this means quite a bit coming from a girl who doesn't like lamb.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong items on the menu.  \n\nOverall, I thought La Ciccia was a decent restaurant but nothing spectacular.  Ambiance was so-so (think bright and cheery).

Good for a romantic date.  This is a small restaurant, probably accomodating 50 - 60 people dining at most.  BE AWARE:  Seating is tight.  I wish they would give more ample seating space b/c I was sitting back to back from someone.

The bar is small but the Italian wine makes up for it.\n\nStaff: Great, friendly, waiters/waistresses; Very knowledgeable of the menu.

We each enjoyed our glasses of red wine - Karana an Italian wine which was very close to Pinot Noir.  They asked if we wanted dessert but we were stuffed from the last dish that as much as we wanted to have dessert, we passed up on it.

Loved it all--the darling owner who makes a point of coming to the table to check on you, the knowledgeable server, the warm ambiance and best of all, the amazing food.  Our party of 4 decided to share all dishes and started with the Burrata and asparagus appetizer special--simply scrumptious.  For the second course we settled upon the fregola with creamy pink-tinged ricotta sauce and the semolina gnochetti with pork meats.  The fregola was cooked to perfection with a consistency similar to a perfectly cooked al dente small pasta--the sauce was a creamy delight.  The gnochetti sauce was spicy but not overly so. For the main course we went with the lamb tenderloin--it was perfection--incredibly tender, melt-in-the-mouth and served with a saute of spinach sweetened with balsamic vinegar.  We declined dessert as one of our party was celebrating her birthday and we had dessert waiting at home.  Our server brought our check along with a little roasted almond semifreddo cake with a candle in it!  Perfect touch and enough for all of us to have a bite and enjoy!  Thank you La Ciccia.

Bread came out first and was a disappointment for both of us, served cold, and got me worried it set the tone for later disappointments. That such a first impression was erased and forgotten by end of the evening is a testament to how much we were wowed by every dish that came out afterward. \n\nCouple notes:  The bread came cold without any butter in sight. We asked about it and learned from the waiter that there is no butter in the restaurant! Chef/owner came out to say 'hi' to patrons later on and proudly reiterated no butter used in his cooking, which I suppose makes for healthier fare. Another note: Just about everything we ordered was spiced with chili flakes (couldn't see the flakes themselves, but when we asked the waitress, she explained that was what was used). We like spicy and were pleasantly surprised by the little kick we got in every dish in this non-Asian/non-Latino cuisine. The spiciness though was not overpowering and we were able to taste the other layers of complex flavors coming through. \n\nFood itself:  The baby octopus stew is as good as everyone says. The spaghetti bottarga (fish roe) had a wonderful consistency, texture, and flavor - creamy but without the guilt. The fregula (Sardinian pasta in the shape of 1/4-inch balls) dish had different flavors come out in every bite depending on what you happen to pick up on your fork - a pleasant surprise in every bite. The ahi tuna dish had best chopped olive sauce I ever had, sweeter and quite unlike any olive tapenade I ever had. The best dish may be the lamb, sooo scrumptious, again prepared differently than I've ever had. The grape must sauce was wonderfully sweet. The desert we had was a gelatto trio of olive oil/fig; goat cheese; and dark chocolate. The chocolate was a substitution for what was supposed to be saffron gelatto which presumably they ran out of, but it was honestly the richest dark chocolate we've had and couldn't get enough of!\n\nOur La Ciccia experience was a wonderful adventure with unique tastes in uniquely prepared food, freshly simple yet flavorfully complex at the same time.

Although I got plenty to eat in the end, I did think that some of the entrees were a bit small for the price.

We had never been before (or had Sardinian food before), but after seeing all the good reviews on Chowhound and Yelp! we had to try it for ourselves.\n\n Our table for four was already waiting for us, despite it being dinner time on Friday and the restaurant being packed. The service was prompt, friendly, and very helpful (great wine recommendations!). We were also able to find parking right in front of the restaurant---so I knew luck was on our side.\n\nFor wine, we started with the Vermentino di Gallura Cantina Pedres Thibalas, which was delicious. We also had a Cannonau, which I had never had before and really wanted to try. It was great -- very dry -- nothing at all what I expected from a Grenache.\n\nFor appetizers we shared the charcuterie of the day, which was a smoked prosciutto. We also shared the octopus stew (Prupisceddu in Umidu), which was fabulously delicious and very different. The octopus stew may have been my favorite dish of the night!\n\nFor a pasta course, we shared the linguine, which was fresh, lemony and wonderful. Though it was pretty simple, it was probably my favorite dish of the night after the octopus stew.\n\nFor my main course, I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the shrimp. The lamb was tender and flavorful and went great with the cauliflower salad it was served with. The shrimp were also great--served in a squid ink and garlic sauce with a little bit of chard on the side.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the almond, honey and saffron cake. It was very light and flavorful -- not too sweet -- to finish off such a great meal. It was a also a generous portion, ideal for sharing.\n\nAnyway, it was a wonderful dinner! We had so much good food and wine that I can't imagine you could go wrong. We will definitely be back -- my only regret is that we did not try the pizzas!", "author": "J S."}

We started with an appetizer of clams and calamari which was so tender and the broth was just so delicious, we had to ask for a second basket of bread!  We had used some of the bread earlier for a taste of olive oil from the first crush of the season and it was fruity and full-bodied.  One of the specials last night  was home made pasta (like linguine) with tuna heart!  It was delicious!  The tuna heart was just shaved over the top of the pasta and added just  enough richness.  I had the wild boar stew which was sublime and my husband had the pork loin which was equally delicious, with fresh herbs like fennel and oregano sprinkled over the top while roasting.  Sadly, we were so stuffed, we didn't have any room for dessert.  The wine list is mostly affordable and packed with many, many choices and the waiters suggestions is always spot on.\nThe service is always impeccable and the staff and owners make you feel so welcomed.  It really is a family restaurant serving top quality food without being pretentious.\nI cannot say enough about this place.  We have decided to make La Ciccia a regular visit at least one time per season.\nOne other mention: Even though the place is small, and the tables tight, you are never once knocked around or even bumped by the bustling wait staff.  The only problem you have to worry about is the pompous wannabe oenophile sitting at the next table boring the hell out of his dinner party.", "author": "Mary D."}

I bet it would take HOURS to get into on any night! Rather than rave, I'll list some of the items we enjoyed: A simple salade,  Risone con Carciofi e Pancetta. Cornetti (never had Italian croissants before), Pesce Spada ala Siracusa, Sardi a Beccaficu Palermitani, and Cioppino were the elements that took us far, far from our Southern USA roots. We dined leisurely for 2 hours. The wine steward was amazed that I am allergic to alcohol, so he brought two glasses of a medium dry white (I still don't know what it was) gratis, because he insisted it was a 'crime to have no vino' with our meal. I sipped mine slowly over the better part of an hour, suffered no ill effects, and enjoyed it immensely. I don't think I'll ever see entrees like these in Atlanta unless I try to cook them, but I don't think I'll find any fresh sardines in any market here.", "author": "George C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-03", "description": "First visit (2006, I think)\n\nI really want to love this place. I love Sardegna and all types of Italian food, and in general it's hard to screw up with quality ingredients. However, La Ciccia failed on a more than a few counts. The lamb was overcooked and the \"fresh\" peas that came with it even more so, and both together in a watery broth was far less than appetizing. The gnochetti did taste of fresh pasta, but little else. The cheese plate was OK but could have been more interesting. Great sardo wine list, points for that. The service was very friendly and prompt - too prompt actually - we felt rushed through the meal. I'll wait a while and give it another try... \n\nSecond visit (early 2007)\n\n2 strikes, you're out. Scallops included unadvertised bottarga - if you're going to use fish eggs, make a note of it. Fresh pasta had great texture again, but no taste, again. Wild boar stew was brown sauce with chunks of meat - I've had my share of cinghiale, and this did not measure up. And where is the contorno (veggies?)!?! \n\nThird visit (June 2006)\n\nOK, I said two strikes, you're out, but I have a soft spot for Italian food in general, and an even softer spot for Sardegna and for the owners for making a go of a very specifically Sardinian restaurant. Reviews by other Yelpers have improved recently as well, and so I buckled under and made a third visit, this time with a group of six. \n\nThis is a pretty small restaurant, and we were seated a smallish, rather wobbly table, but we squeezed in and it didn't prove to be a problem. The owners and staff are certainly super friendly, warm and engaging, which helped start the evening off in the right direction. \n\nWe had a pesto pizza as sort of a pre-appetizer, I think mainly because Fosco got a little drunk on lo spritz at my place beforehand - and the pizza was certainly tasty, but if you're sticking with purely Sardo cuisine there's no need to reach for a pizza at La Ciccia. Once we sat down we ordered a bottle of red Cannonau (\"La Marina\", I think, but don't hold me to that) and the octopus stew and tuna carpaccio appetizers. The wine (on recommedation) was fairly priced, excellent, and a great representation of a relatively unfamiliar grape (from Sardegna of course). Octopus in a tomato-based sauce was tender, very fresh & tasty, and the tuna carpaccio was excellent great too. \n\nFor mains we ordered spaghetti with seafood ragu, lamb chops, whole branzino, more octopus, and the Fregua, whatever that is. The seafood ragu was good - a ground-up mixture of various \"sea fruits\", although the tomato sauce tasted a bit like the octopus starter. The lamb was perfectly cooked and delicous, but we put that down to the quality of the meat more than anything, and the olive tapenade didn't really add anything to the dish. Branzino looked nice but it was across the table and so I didn't taste it - branzino is great fish, and the preparation was traditional but fairly plain. Unfortunately I can't remember the fregula, as we were moving through our third bottle of wine at this point, having switched to an *amazing* Carignano (del Sulcis \"Buio Buio\") - again, a great recommendation from the host. \n\nSomehow we managed to fit in a cheese plate and a glass of local Moscato - lovely stuff. \n\nOverall, La Ciccia is much improved from my first two visits. There were some very tasty dishes, but the menu shows a little bit of repetition, e.g. the octopus & seafood ragu similarity. Some of this is due to the narrow focus of the restaurant, so perhaps we just needed to do a better job of ordering. Or just quit complaining and enjoy the food. Wine was excellent. Service was great - again, super friendly, competent, and not rushed. \n\nI'd give La Ciccia 3.5 stars if I could -- and I'd be happy to return with the goal of adding another star! \n\nViva la Sardegna!", "author": "Bowen D."}

I've moved out of the Bay Area, but every time I am back, I make sure to dine at La Ciccia.  \n\nAlthough there are a number of excellent Italian restaurants in the Bay Area, La Ciccia's food is incredibly unique and distinctive.  I had never had Sardinian food before coming to La Ciccia, but my experience with La Ciccia has made me fall in love with its rich flavors.  The bottarga pasta, in particular, was a culinary revelation for me, and the sea urchin tuna heart is also excellent.  They also had wonderful roasted sardines several months ago, which my date and I enjoyed as a starter.  \n\nThe restaurant also shines in its hospitality and cozy atmosphere.  The last time I went there, for instance, there was a slight delay in preparing our table.  Although we had only waited about ten minutes, the hostess (who I think may be the co-owner) became very apologetic, and gave my date and me free wine while we waited.  After we were seated, we both enjoyed the salume of the day, which was delicious and very generous in terms of proportions.  I then had the aforementioned battarga pasta, while my date had the gnochetti.  Because the portions for the salume were so generous (the waiter said that it was designed to be shared by two people, but it probably would be more than enough for three), my date and I did not order desert.  The waiter, however, apparently still apologetic about the very slight delay before we were seated, gave us a free desert as well, which was a delicious semifreddo.  The waiter came again and asked if we had enjoyed our meal.  I remarked that I loved the bottarga pasta.  The chef then emerged from the kitchen with a wrapped piece of bottarga, which he gave to me, along with instructions about how to use it in a pasta dish.  The hospitality of La Ciccia was so extraordinary that I almost felt guilty, as if I was not sufficiently clear about how wonderful the food was.  In conclusion, La Ciccia is a wonderful restaurant:  it has provided some of the most memorable meals that I have ever had, and I will definitely continue my tradition of going there every time I visit the Bay Area.", "author": "Randall S."}

First of all, the owner (doubling as hostess) is lovely and gracious, and our server was very friendly. Can't complain at all about the service. Hubby and I went for our anniversary dinner and decided to make a trek into the city. I started off with the spaghetti with bottarga, and hubby had the special salad for that day, which was smoked trout. Now, I had no idea what bottarga was, so I looked it up online because so many reviewers raved about this dish. It is supposed to be the whole roe sack, dried, and then grated. That was not what this was... my spaghetti came out with fresh yellow roe on top and was very odd. I have to say, the spaghetti itself was cooked perfectly al dente, but the dish was just weird. Hubby hardly touched his salad, only saying it was \"interesting\" (not a good sign). We ordered some flatbread, which I expected to be more doughy like Paratha or something, but it was like a cracker. It was drizzled with olive oil (everything is drizzled or drenched in olive oil, understandably considering the region) and had aged pecorino cheese on top. But every time I tried to crack off a piece, the cheese flew off and it was just plain cracker. Oh well. I ordered the prawns for my entree, and hubby got the ravioli special. I knew I was in trouble when a busboy brought by a wet cloth napkin and set it beside me saying \"for the prawns\". Well, there were 4 big prawns, split lengthwise, all perfectly intact, and drenched in olive oil. As I attempted to dislodge them from the shell, olive oil was flying everywhere and got all over my nice pants and cashmere sweater. I gave up after 1 prawn. Not worth it. Plus, the dish was so pungent. Everything was so fishy smelling. I just didn't feel like things were fresh. I'll just spare you the rest. Again, service was great, and I think that everything was probably right on for the region, but I just didn't like it. I give 3 stars as a benefit of the doubt for the regional food and because service was very nice. Food (for me) would be a 1-star. But more power to you if you enjoy this kind of cuisine.", "author": "Goldi J."}

I admit I am geographically challenged at times. oh, its an island...and it has its own cuisine!\n\nEating at La Ciccia was my first experience of Sardinian food- not your standard Italian fare.  They give hearty single glass pours and have an extensive wine list consisting of obscure Italian wines.  Using a 6 pt font, the entire Italian wine list fit on the back of a one page menu.  I felt like i needed bifocals.  However, there really is no need to read the winelist- just ask the knowledgeable bartendar or waitstaff for a recommendation and they will definitely find your match.  \n\nAfter our waiter, Matia, with his thick Italian accent, told us the specials- all from sardinia, obviously- we were sold.  one of each please- are we sharing?  yes we are!  We ordered the swordfish carpaccio, the crostini,  the sardinian gnochetti, wild boar ragu special, the sardinian sea bass, the pork chop special, the sardinian cheese plate and the strawberry dessert.   Each dish was expertly cooked and had its own distinct flavor- the swordfish carpaccio with a few sprinkles of salt allowed the taste of the fish to shine, the homemade seminola pasta was perfectly al dente, the sardinian sea bass flaked off the bone and there was no mistaking the strong boar flavor in the ragu.  The flavors of each dish were delicately balanced- none of the dishes were overambitious with too many competing flavors.  \n\nBalanced, simple Italian-influenced cooking at its best.  La Ciccia is one of my new favorite restaurants in SF where one doesn't have to drop the whole paycheck.  i'm definitely going back for more. And next time i'm trying the tuna heart...from sardinia.", "author": "michelle d."}

I'm wondering if those in love with their overly oily, greasy, relatively flavorless food and mediocre service hasn't been to Italy and therefore isn't used to the type of food that we call Italian. \n\nMy special tagliatelle pasta with mushrooms was overcooked. The pasta was mushy, drenched in oil, and the mushrooms were overdone and had lost their flavor. My girls wild boar dish of maccheroni was marginal, not great, and definitely not worth the drive out to 30th when so many other places could satiate our Italian needs and much better. The octopus starter was good, but didn't make up for the rest of the food that really was nothing but blah. My server didn't know anything about the wine list, so I'm glad that the bottles I ordered were good considering I'm not too familiar with Sicilian wine at all, just Italian and French. We were offered no olive oil, balsamic, or any other accoutrement with our bread, just \"Are you ready to order?\" and no helpful comments about the menu in any way shape or form. Some of my friends are diehards for the place, but they're alcoholics (no judgement, as I'm in the club as well) anyway and I'm thinking that they're just drunk before they get there and cold Domino's pizza would probably suffice for the evening in their state. \n\nMaybe I've just become a true food snob, but this place is not up to par and the atmosphere is nothing to speak of. I would pass, without remose. We had five people, and the bill was 350.00. Not worth that, or an even hundo if you asked me for what we got. Big disappointment.", "author": "Danielle S."}

I am therefore surprised that some people speak of \"Italian\" food as big bowls of pasta with thick tomato sauce... That is NOT \"Italian\" food, that is bad Italian American food, what you get in the majority of restaurants in the US. And I am afraid that this is the comparison term, but alas on the positive side, for those who find the food here blend. \nThis is excellent, simple, regional food. No French or Californian novelle cuisine, no fusion, no Alinea or Schwa, so if this is what you are looking for, do not come here (prices, fortunately, are accordingly much lower).\nBut this is truly good Sardinian food, which means it's also good ITALIAN food. Excellent pastas with seafood, excellent meat, salumi, and dessert. I can't speak for the \"secondi di pesce\" (what you would call here fish main courses) because I came here only once and didn't try it, but I am pretty sure I would find them as good. I could try a variety of things because we were four people, and I liked everything, especially the pasta with bottariga and the one with tuna.\nThe service was very good. I very much doubt people are discriminated for racist reasons, and people should always think twice before accusing of such a shameful thing (and wondering about their own rudeness or lack of understanding instead). \nCome here if you are interested in authentic, good Italian food from one of the best Italian culinary traditions. Don't come looking for cannoli (which, if authentically made, are hard to find anyway) or what you are used to in Italian American restaurants. It's not worth it, in every sense.", "author": "Sara P."}

The interior has been redone in a simple but comfortable manner.  Though the gray haze pouring out ot the front door when I entered was disconcerting, I was assured that the kitchen \"incident\" that had provoked it was under control.\r\n\r\nThe menu consists entirely of Sardinian specialities; or at least that is what they told me.  Having never been to that part of Italy, I can not vouch for its authtenticity.  However, most of the items on the menu (except for some pizzas) were new to me.  They most definitely reflected the best of rustic Italian cooking -- a few simple flavors melded together to create a wonderful dish.  If you like Incanto, a few blocks away, you should definitely try La Ciccia.  I am not sure whether it as good (that will take more visits) but its approach to food is very similar.\r\n\r\nPrices are reasonable ($17 for most entrees) and the wine list is modestly priced.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-08-08", "description": "I was very excited to see some hype about the opening of La Ciccia in the Chronicle and Daily Candy, if for no other reason than it might bring some attention to the sometimes sleepy Noe Valley dining scene (excepting the wonderful Firefly, of course).  The space La Ciccia occupies is fairly tiny and the lights are too bright -- I suggest the owners soften them to create a more romantic vibe.  We started off with some salads and one of the terrific pizzas.  I was expecting a Neopolitan style pie, charred a bit around the edges, but was nonetheless quite pleased with the slightly doughier but tasty version created here.  Entrees were not quite as delicious as the appetizers, but were promising.  The chocolate dessert (can't remember its name -- starts with a T, I think) was excellent.  Wine list is impressive and quite reasonable.  Actually, all of the prices at La Ciccia are reasonable.\n\nThe owners are a husband and wife pair from Sardinia.  I believe the husband toiled away at several SF restaurants before setting up his own shop, including my personal favorite Italian, Antica Tratorria.  The wife takes care of the front of the restaurant in a very maternal way, checking in on tables and serving the wine.  She makes eating here a very warm and cozy experience.\n\nBottom Line: room for improvement on the entrees, but all in all, a wonderful homey new restaurant in Outer Noe Valley.", "author": "L G."}

The one thing that they lack here is that \"Someone's about to get wacked\" vibe. La Ciccia, while it has a high quality of food and service, does not have that vibe. The menu also reflects this in that if you're hankering for lotsa pasta and cheese or something like Eggplant Parm, forget it. There are enough other \"gourmet\" as opposed to \"everyday\" Italian restaurants in SF that you can go to a different one every week for a year.

If you live in Noe/Castro/Glenn Park area check it out.  Worth a trip from further out if you like authentic Italian (not north beach Italian).\n \n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n \nAmbience/Atmosphere: 3 stars.  The atmosphere here is what you would expect for a neighborhood joint.  Its not hip, its not really exciting, just comfortable and inviting.  A great feel for a weeknight dinner with significant other or friend.  They have done a good job of adding a touch of elegance.  There is a small bar (about 3 or 4 seats), if you are flying solo and want a quick dinner and a good glass of wine.  \n \nService: 4 stars.  I was actually surprised by the service.  Our waiter was excellent.  He knew the menu, and had a great deal of expertise on the wine list (a rarity at a place like this).    He really did everything right, he was there when we needed him, and there wasn't a single time when I felt something was lacking, was taking too much time, or needed attention.  The chef came out half way through our meal to give us a try of the wild boar stew (I had originally ordered this, but since it takes an hour I switched), which was a nice touch.   \n \nFood: 4 stars.  I think the food rivals Incanto as some of the most authentic Italian in the city.  It is different from Incanto in style, keeping tightly to its Sardinian roots.  We started with the lentil soup and a special, crostini's done three ways.  The lentil soup was really tasty (from what I understand, didn't reach over for a taste), and the crostini's were awesome (although the one with Octopus was a tiny bit fishy. the others were chopped porcini mushrooms and traditional tomato bruschetta).  For mains we had a pasta in white wine sauce with porcini mushrooms and the lamb chops.  The lamb chops were incredible.  Had a fantastic rub/herb oil on them, and were cooked rare.  The meat melted in my mouth, very good, and highly recommend.  I didn't try the pasta, but my dining companion mentioned that the dish was very good (there was nothing left when he was done, so I am taking this as a positive).   The deserts were a mixed bag.  We had a barely pudding (kind of like a rice pudding) that was weird, mostly due to texture.  However, we also got a chocolate mousse cake that was really great.  It was very rich, but not heavy.\n \nWine: 4 stars.  Like Incanto, La Ciccia knows how to build a list around its menu.  All Italian, which it should be, given that it is an Italian restaurant.  We had a fantastic Barbaresco for only $49.  I felt the list was priced well and the variety was really great.  At some point they may want to cut out a couple of the regions and add a little more focus, but other than that they have done I think the best job I have seen on a wine list for a restaurant of this type.  For most people the names on the list will seem unfamiliar so I would encourage you to ask for some guidance. 9 out of 10 times I bring my own wines to restaurants, I can say I will probably not ever do that here. \n \nOverall: 4 stars.  Lets just say I was extremely pleased as well as pleasantly surprised by my visit to La Ciccia.  I will definitely be returning in the near future.  Well done.", "author": "Scott P."}

The restaurant is small with maybe ten-fifteen tables. The wine menu is completely Italian wines.  We asked for suggestions for and the waiter poured us a few reds that he thought went well with our meals.  (Waiters, all male, seemed to all be Italian with thick accents, they were all dressed in hip jeans and tight button down black shirts. Definitely not bad to look at ). Both wines were very good and did pair well with our food. \n\nThe menu is small but has a great assortment of dishes. And they seem to always have additional specials. To start I order the Clam and Calamari for an appetizer which came in a delicious tangy broth.  My boyfriend ordered the seafood salad with lemon sauce (clam, prawns, calamari, and mussels) the seafood salad was served warm and was also delicious. For dinner we decided to by pass the entrees and just order pasta. I order the Sardinian Fergula (basically Israeli Couscous) with mushrooms and pancetta. It was great and very savory. My boyfriend ordered Gnocchiette with pork meat. The sauce was perfectly flavored with a peppery hint.  The portions were perfect and we left feeling very satisfied. At the end of the meal the chef stopped by to inquire if the meal was going well. I always love when the chef makes a point to chat with the customers so this little extra definitely made me smitten.\nThey also seem to do take out (at least the pizzas) so I will be making pilgrimages back when I am too lazy to cook.

The temptation to eat here every night may land me in the poor house, morbidly obese, or with my ruptured organs showered all over the shocked and unsuspecting patrons of this fine establishment. Not that I wouldn't crawl on bloody stumps through the desert just to get a taste of that braised octopus, because I would. I had a warm, fuzzy feeling from the first moment I walked in to make a reservation. I gave the stout Sardinan matriarch my first name, and as soon as she heard it, the rest of the conversation took place in Italian, hers heavily Sardinified and mine just plain rusty. They were (deservedly) booked solid the whole weekend, despite this, she managed to conjure up a spot for two out of thin air. Thank God. We powered through multiple dishes involving two of my very favorite things to eat: tentacles and squid ink. We had planned a variety of post dinner activities, but our meal lasted no less than three hours. We didn't even notice the passage of time, and neither did they. The lack of salt on the table seems to be a contentious issue, but after a while I gratefully ceded my urge to micromanage the chef's affairs, and gladly capitulated, trusting that I was in good hands. And yes, we were so stuffed that we refused the dessert menu, but they, undoubtedly having noticed my ecstatic raving throughout the evening, were not about to let us get away without trying the semifreddo, which they comped.

They go to La Ciccia - which means fat.  However in this context the slang means \"Friend/Buddy\" as you would use \"Chico/Muchacho\" in Spanish.  And this is what the restaurant promise -  a friendly atmosphere with simple but fresh dishes.\n\nWe have been to La Ciccia numerous time.  We always order the warm Seafood Salad with Lemon Oil Dressing as appetizer.  It is so tender with a slight hint of citrus infused in the olive oil.  Recently we tried the Pesto pizza which is crispy around the edges and firm in all the right places.  The first time we were there my BF got the Lamb chops and he knew immediately he would love the place.  It was cooked to perfection - nice sears on the outside and juicy red in the middle.  I did not try his plate but he was raving about it.  This time he ordered the fresh pasta di seppia with some kind of fish bits - the special of the evening.  The pasta was very fresh and tasty but he did not care for the tomato fish bits - he thought the sauce was too authentic for his Northern Italian palette.  I ordered the gnocchetti Sardi (not at all similar to their potato gnocchi cousin) - one of my favorite dishes.  These gnocchetti are the specialty of Sardinian cuisine - made from semolina flour - smaller and firmer.  Our friend got the Baked Giant Prawns - she liked it a lot BUT it is a mess to cut into to get to the meat.  Definitely not a date dish.  She had prawn juice squirted on her nice top.  Once we ordered the Sardinian Flat Bread but in the end we realized it can never be as good as home-made.  They get these flat breads from Sardinia but the taste is not the same.  Can't tell you why but we did not like it - I've been to Sardegna and have tested them right off the griddle.  There are no words to explain the simplicity of such a humble bread.\n\nI also recommend the red wine Carignano del Sulcis \"Buio\" - a lovely dark red colour and a fruitful nose with an excellent drying finish.  I promise you will not go wrong.\n\nDessert - maybe next time....", "author": "Veritas V."}

We made a reservation (recommended!) and arrived at 8:45pm to find the dining room full and lively. \nThe decor is beautifully done - a lovely sky blue paint on flat walls with art hanging tastefully throughout. There is also a dark wooden wine bar, where the owners store a very comprehensive and widely ranged wine list. Both times I've been to this restaurant I have been impressed with the wine. I was also taken with the staff - their depth of knowledge and professional friendliness  - unpretentious, informative, nice (in some cases funny). \nThe owners came by our table both times we dined there to receive comments on the food, as well as to \"check in\" with their guests. One of the owners is the chef. They are both native Sardegnians and that is the flavor the food.\nThe Food.\nWell, the food is really outstanding. I had the boar stew in one sitting and it was absolutely delightful - rich and flavorful, not heavily salted as some chefs are wont to do, with excellent texture to both the broth and the stewed vegetables and the boar itself.  The flavor medley was perfect - I did the \"Happy Tummy\" dance before I knew it. (yes, its something I actually do, kind of bouncing up and down in my chair - its honestly a completely spontaneous reaction to really great food. Completely spontaneous and inevitably slightly embarrassing.)\nI would recommend this for any occasion - except for larger groups. We had 5 in our group and I think it was probably the most I would bring there at once, simply due to the size of the restaurant which is NOT big.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-09", "description": "I love this place!  Brought my in laws and 4 y.o. daughter here on Saturday at 6pm - the place was bustling all night long!  In laws said it was worth the trip from the East Bay 'burbs (that's saying a LOT from them).  Let's start with atmosphere -- warm and welcoming, I felt like I was dining in someone's home.  From the owner, Lorella, to her staff, everyone seemed committed to making sure diners were really enjoying themselves.  Lorella stopped by several times to check on our 4 year old, even giving her the Italian names for the dolls she brought with her.  The waiters were savvy about handling a child, keeping an eye on her milk, making a simple pasta for her because we asked, and even double checking the ice cream flavors for her dessert. \n\nPacing was perfect!  We ordered family style so we could work our way through the courses.  Everything was fantastic:  aged prosciutto (don't know if they cure there or bring it in), a yummy cracker bread, lentil soup, seafood salad with tiny, tender octopus in an amazing broth that we used to mop up the bread; ravioli with lamb ragu had a lemon zest which gave it a bright and floral hint that truly elevated the dish; pasta with sole was handmade pasta cooked perfectly with a lovely, briny sauce; main courses of halibut over spinach was moist (and big!) and a slow-cooked pork with olives that also included a few pork ribs was meltingly tender.  The food sparkled because it was simple and well-prepared with fresh ingredients and an eye for balance.\n\nVery extensive wine list.  With essentially zero knowledge on Italian wines, they were happy to help, and they made excellent pairing suggestions.\n\nIt's not a big place, and it is probably best for groups of 4 (promotes sharing).  We did see a really large party there that night, so with reservations, that seems possible.  The owner even commented that she deliberately kept reservations lighter on this particular Saturday because she knew she had a big party (I'd say there were at least 10 or 12 at the table), and she wanted to make sure the ktichen could do a good job for everyone.  What a concept!  \n\nA gem of a neighborhood restaurant that is worth a drive across town or further.  Trust yourself in their hands -- they love their food and their diners, and they will give you a wonderful evening.", "author": "Cindy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-02", "description": "I had dinner last week and it was probably the single most outstanding San Francisco Italian meal I have eaten. We did not have a reservation, but were served at the bar, facing a sheer screen that looked into the kitchen. Best seats in the house! We could watch the procession of dishes and it looked like the chef was practically making love to each dish.  Our waiter was a hoot, and knew every ingredient in the food. He volunteered the menu he had for his birthday recently, and we ordered the octopus stew (fantastic - lots of whole baby octopus in a tomato sauce), the lamb ragout on homemade penne, and the standout was the seafood special made with black pasta (ink included).  Pay attention to the specials and ask to have them repeated. Be bold - try something new! This is not the place for vegetarians or those high maintenance whiners who want to have the dish re-created to suit their tastes. And remember Sardinia is an island...seafood and some sheep running around...so go with the classic seafood choices.\nLorella, the manager, knows every wine on the list, and there's more than 100. The price range is about $19 to $40 per bottle - very reasonable for the quality. She paired it perfectly with our menu. She pays extraordinary attention to detail. The water pitchers were wrapped with napkins, a waiter's corkscrew and napkin were at the ready on the corner of the bar, personal salt and pepper shakers were offered - no details missed. We were among the last customer's, and the chef asked if we would like to sample a seafood special he was working on for the next day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-13", "description": "I have been a long time acquaintance of Massimo and Lorella, and although I see but little of them, I consider them dear friends--and how could I not?  They are incredibly gracious, hospitable, self-deprecating to a fault and generous, and their love for the world of food and wine comes through in every joyous gesture.  At La Ciccia, they've become for me a corporeal embodiment of all that makes a neighborhood eatery great.  A genuine sense of warmth pervades here and makes you feel shame for not eating here more often.\n\nThe cuisine here attempts to pass itself off as \"simple\"--or maybe this is just the chef's sense of understating things.  The simplicity is just in the presentation: the intensity and complex soulfulness of the flavors belie easy categorization.  The seafood salad is an oratorio of tentacular delight, where a charmingly light herby nage binds together a multitude of sea-faring voices that are perfectly crispety and crunchety alongside a stray slice of carrot that finishes with a slight tingle of heat.  For the more nautically adventurous, the octopus brings a serious, briny punch to it's tomato sauce, with just the right amount of chew to know you've vanquished the underwater devil.  The tripe is so good, that you can convince a vegetarian that it's ok to eat.  \n\nFlatbreads/pizzetti here are excellent and you should avail yourself of them for the bready portion of your evening.  The pasta's however, deserve particular mention.  As far as I'm concerned, there are damned few places to get perfect pasta in this town, and La ciccia is one of those places.  The kitchen cooks the pasta to utter perfection--just chewy enough to truly appreciate the flavor, just soft enough to draw in a good bit of sauce.  True to its island heritage, many of the pastas find their melodic core in flavors of the sea, but these are beautifully counterpointed by the right amount of herb, fat and acid that it never feels heavy.  The pasta with shaved tuna heart has the perfect level of oceanic funk, that lends depth to the al dente strands without overpowering with a feeling of fishiness (as is the case up the street at Incanto).  Afraid of bottarga?  Don't be--it's so deftly done here that even my non-pescatorial girlfriend was pleasantly surprised and went back for a second helping.  If there's a special pasta of the day that involves \"anything but the hooves\", well then you should go for it--the layering of flavors from these strange cut-lets and gristly bits adds such an incredible richness to the ragu, that it's downright erotic, for those enamoured of food-porn.\n\nOn the wine-side, the list here has one of the coolest selection of italian goodies out there, many of which will challenge the knowledge of even the most die-hard of Italian-philes, and the prices are great.  Lorella's taste is impeccable, so by all means, tell her what you're vaguely looking for and let her (and perhaps Massimo) come up with that somewhat odd and unusual but delicious something from somewhere that you won't find elsewhere.  Muller Thurgau from freaking basilicata?  charming-lass-in-a-summer-frock sort of loveliness.  Be adventurous and your life will be the richer.\n\nThe girlfriend is prodding me to add something about the desserts: simple, delicious, and worth saving a little room for.  I mean, who would have thought that a little pistachio ice-cream could be so damn good, never mind that Chocolate hand-grenade of pleasure.", "author": "Kosuke I."}

The result, no matter what the noise, street parking or occasional slips in service, is real food both distinctive and delicious.\nThe wine list is an inspiration since it is dominated by Sardinian wines which are new experiences for 99% of us.  I tasted 6-7 wines with my friends over the course of a 3-hour dinner and was impressed with the unique tastes that pair wonderfully with the chef/owner's cuisine.  Even if most of the ingredients do come from California, Chef Massimo has learned to adapt them to Sardinian cuisine in a powerful way.\nIt is interesting that some yelp reviewers give this restaurant low marks.  Most rave about La Ciccia.  Viva la difference;  however, this is a restaurant that should not be missed on a trip to San Francisco.  For the cost of a cab ride from downtown, it is well worth it since prices at restaurants downtown are not to be believed.  Ask me because I dined another night in one of the famous venues and got nose bleed from the bill - and the food was not even close in taste and umami.\nPS  I arrived early and sat at the bar reading my newspaper.  A smallish man with very dark hair and intense eyes brought over a taste of wine and a small dish of something that looked like a fish carpaccio.  It turned out to be a slightly pickled onion looking for a future home as an ingredient in the appetizer offerings.  Then the fried Sardinian olives(in Sardinian olive oil) arrived with another Sardinian wine.  Both times he asked what I thought about the onion and olives as well as the wines.  Then I knew I was meeting a chef who was passionate about his food and interested to learn what others thought.

Very yummy indeed!\n\nWe also got the Pani Guttiau (Sardinian Flat Bread baked with Cuor d'Olivo and Pecorino), good, but it really could be skipped.\n\nWe didn't get dessert cause we were STUFFED. \n\nThey also served us veggies, peas with carrots, very nice. \n\nService was good, very friendly not overly stuffy.\n\nAlthough we are not wine drinkers the entire back of the menu was full of Italian wine (in font 8, I think).\n\nEveryone there was drinking wine and they seemed to make a big deal of it! They chef was touring the tables and commenting the wines. So I assume it is a good place to do so.", "author": "Peppe R."}

Really, she didn't have to, as we were early, but it certainly warmed us to her.  The evening went on like this, attentive, friendly service.\nWe started with the octopus stew - very tasty, slightly spicy wine/tomato sauce.  Then we had pizza, good, the crust on the chewy side.  Pasta was the best - I had the spaghetti with shaved tuna and roe.  Just so good.  And hubby had the wild boar stew, which came with a side of mashed potatoes (yum).

Have to say, I was pretty impressed, though I must admit, they did seem a bit overwhelmed (but overwhelmed because of how busy they were, which means there are a lot of people there enjoying their food!) at times. Apparently this is their first restaurant ever, so they're still learning the ropes, kinda. I think they'll do quite well though with a little practice (and patient customers). They were so friendly and seemed to genuinely care about our dining experience. We walked in without a reservation, so they asked us to wait a few minutes at the bar. No problem. Then they poured us 2 glasses of champagne \"to accompany the wait\". :-) Not 10 minutes later, we were seated at a fine table, and ordered a glass of wine and the mozzarella and red pepper appetizer (which, btw was delicious). Unfortunately, we did have to ask where our wine was, but I almost felt bad, because it was so clear they were working their hardest and had simply forgotten given the rush of people they had not anticipated receiving. Our server was extremely apologetic and very helpfuul when we had questions about the menu, and wound up bringing us 3 desserts instead of the 1 we ordered, to apologize for the wine incident (it arriving late). The desserts themselves were average, I'd say, but the accompanying blood orange gelato was out of this world. My friend is allergic to oranges, so I got to enjoy the whole thing myself (sorry Diana!) All in all, I was very happy and will definitely be returning in the near future.", "author": "beth l."}

But then again, every region (or town for that matter) in Italy has it's own cuisine. Just think if this cuisine as the super-concentrated, sun-kissed (and somewhat more seafood-focused) version of Italian food.

At this restaurant there  was the water but no bread.  After asking for bread and it was brought I said \"Do you have any butter, olive oil or some sort of tapenade  for the bread?\" Eating room temperature bread without any butter, olive oil or tapenade is not very good, if not difficult, and rather dry.  The waitress looked shocked that I asked.  She then said olive oil was $2 extra.  Since we did not want to eat dry bread while waiting for our order we said alright.  The olive oil came in a small saucer the size for a tea bag.  We thought that was  ridiculous.  I have talked to many people about it and all were astounded.  Next we will be charged for laundering the napkins and pay for the soap to wash the dishes.  The food at La Ciccia is good and the hostess was very nice but there are alot of good food with nice hostesses restaurants out there.

We piled into the front booth on a windy Friday evening. The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and (with the exception of the interminable wait for the check) well executed. First, I need to tell you about the menu: if you were thinking of impressing your date with how well you navigated the menu and conversed with the waiter in your best Junior High Italian, fahgeddaboutit! My Italian skills were no match for the menu written in Sardinian dialect. I kid you not. Therefore, it was a little tricky to get my footing, but pretty soon we were able to sort out the pasta dish (nice and delicate) from the pizza (very solid, though not in A16 territory) from the lamb stew (solid but waaay overseasoned.) The apps were also good -- fresh porcini mushrooms lightly sauteed in olive oil and garlic, and a calamari salad swimming in a tangy vinagrette. Overall, a nice dinner and not too rough on the platinum card. I felt the dishes were a little off-balance and there could have been a bit more pizzazz in some of the flavorings, but we were sated and happy we dined at La Ciccia. Probably doesn't pass the 'would-we-go-back' test given the tremendous choices in this city we are so fortunate to live in, but would certainly recommend it if someone was chomping at the bit for a VERY authentic and unpretentious dining experience a la Sardiniese.

My mom ended up having a pasta dish with a sausage ragout, while I had a wonderful rare lamp dish. At the end of the evening the owner stopped by our table.

This homey, cozy restaurant offers perfectly seasoned, richly flavored cuisine from Sardinia, that other Italian island.  On my last visit we were greeted by the most pleasant woman with a soothing Italian accent.  Although reservations are almost a must now, she found us that not-so-romantic spot between the restroom and the kitchen, but who cares, the food made up for it.  So did the servers, even though we had a trainee in-tow with ours.  We split a special fresh spaghetti with Porcinis.  To-Die-For!  Lightly scented with fresh thyme and covered with sauteed Porcinis and onions.  Very simple, very fresh, very good.  Then on to the pizza.  My tell for a perfect Italian dining experience is the pizza.  I love the pizza at Delfina and also at Cafe Gialina in Glen Park, so you know where I am coming from.  We chose the Pizza Sarda I believe was the name.  It was made with a simple tomato sauce, oregano, Mozzarella, Pecorino and capers (although I found only one).  The crust was a little chewy but the overall flavor was perfect.  We also had a side offering of sauteed baby globe artichokes with chili flakes.  They were as good as I would make at home.

The owner's wife was so sweet and attentive and it really made our experience - so many new \"hot\" places have such terrible service and this was so not the case here! We also really liked their food. You kick things off with some bread dipped in olive oil - try not to fill up too much on this though - the olive oil was really good so we went a bit overboard I think. We then had the Salumi which was fabulous and one of the highlights of the meal. Then, the clams and mussels - the bread is really great to soak up the wonderful buttery juices. Then - a special of the day, shortribs with another fabulous sauce to dip the bread in (can you see what's happening here, we are really filling up on bread!). And then their wonderful pizza - we went for the first one, the Sarda, which had a great sprinkle of capers, just the right amount of flavor and saltiness without being overdone. At this point we were absolutely stuffed and still had our entrees coming. 2 of us had the wild boar stew and 2 had the lamb chops. There was absolutely nothing wrong with our entrees but we couldn't eat much of them. The lamb chop has a lot of fennel so you have to be a fennel fan - if you want the classic seared chop that's not what you're getting here. But they come with a great zucchini and squash medley, and it's a generous portion of chops as well, 3! The stew was quite good. What I would do next time is just come for a ton of the apps, pizza, etc. and skip the entrees, because I really enjoyed all the starters. Corkage is $25 but they waive it if you buy a bottle so not a bad deal! Their pricing is quite reasonable across the board.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-06", "description": "When I don't know much about cooking in a particular country, I frequently want to add a caveat to my reviews/opinions of ethnic restaurant quality. Sure I liked the tacos, but I know nothing of how the Mexicans think tacos should be prepared so perhaps my opinion matters less than someone's who knows. However, an argument could be made that it doesn't matter. After all, so the argument goes, whether or not John Doe likes the food--in all of his cultural ignorance--is far more important than how true its preparation and presentation are to the way it is done in the mother country. This question can best be answered by looking to the culture from which the food originates. \n\nUnless you've dined in Italy with Italians it's difficult to imagine how particular they are about food. They are particular about how food is prepared and how it is served (e.g., pasta is cooked until it is al dente; seafood pasta never gets cheese on top). There are very specific rules about what dishes are served together and the course in which they are eaten (e.g., pizza is not ordered with a first or second, the pasta course is eaten before the meat course, coffee after dessert).  Even the time of day in which they are eaten is strictly defined (e.g., milk is served at breakfast not dinner, cappuccino is never ordered after 11 am).  These are absolutes; there is no room for culinary relativism in Italy.  Food is perhaps the most dear and seriously considered thing in an Italian's life.  To answer the question above, In the case of Italian food--Sardinia *is* part of Italy--the resounding, emphatic answer is YES IT MATTERS!\n\nSo, on to reviewing La Ciccia without the caveat.  La Ciccia judged by the Italian standard receives a solid five stars. From the Salumi to the Octopus Stew to the Branzino, La Ciccia is authentic and outstanding. What's more, the front of house staff are friendly and helpful: traits not always encountered in restaurants in Italy.   Over the last two years I've ordered everything on the menu and consistently found it to be excellent.\n\nIf you are looking for outstanding Italian food then look no further than La Ciccia. Whether or not you agree speaks to just how \"educated\" on Italian food you are, and how much further you have to go. :-)", "author": "Rich M."}

We then ordered some pizza margherita, a tender lamb dish, broccoli rabe (done perfectly), and a fish dish (sorry, it's been awhile). Everything that night was absolutely perfect- food, wine, service, and company!!  It's unfortunate I haven't found anything comparable here in NYC (without sacrificing an arm and a leg for dinner)....  i miss SF....sigh.....", "author": "Angie L."}

The food is delicious, the service and welcome you get when you walk in the (albeit cozy) entryway is unparalleled, and the wine list is exciting without overwhelming.  I'm very confused by the recent tepid review from the Chronicle; we've been going to La Ciccia since it first opened and have always had great experiences with friends and family there.", "author": "Heather C."}
