Jamie W. and I came here after stopping to smell the roses and whatever flora they have at the San Francisco Botanical Garden. The high praise on Yelp lured us in on a slow Saturday afternoon when we had the full attention of the very young staff (photo: http://bit.ly/2eDdrH8).\n\nThere was no sighting of owner Haymen Da Luz, whom I heard was quite the colorful connoisseur, but his staff did him proud with their thorough descriptions and obliging behavior during our generous tea tasting. The selection covered the full range of loose leaf teas - jasmine, white, green oolong, black, pu-erh. We went for the sweeter ones like Chocolate Mint and Peach Momo White Tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2uKhQ12) before settling on a purchase of the Coconut Green Tea which was deliciously Mounds-like in flavor (photo: http://bit.ly/2ukLiZh). There were all kinds of tea accessories available including little clay pots and gaiwan sets (photo: http://bit.ly/2tPiOF9).

Not that I have a dislike of tea: far from it! But it was only until recently, learning that tea *wasn't* the cause of my teeth stains, that I started getting back into it. And what better way than to stock up on loose leaf teas?!\n\nStopping in one day after lunch nearby, my friend and I sat down to a (free!) tea tasting session with the surprisingly hip and hilarious owner of the shop, sampling almost a dozen varietals, and learning quite a bit about the origins and differences during that process.\n\nWith so many teas available, ranging all across the quality spectrum, it can definitely be hard to choose, but they help find tea samples that meet your particular interests. That said, even that can be a little off, as I didn't like most of the initial teas enough to commit, only coming across a couple at the very end of my tasting session. Part of the reason for this is probably due to them brewing a much stronger tea than I myself prefer, so keep that in mind while taste testing.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Not very large, but very spacious, with just the single counter in the back for the register and tea tasting, so accessibility shouldn't be too big an issue.\n\nBathroom - Don't think they actually have a public one.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Truly exceptional customer service combined with an extensive and high quality selection of teas make for an unforgettable experience.  Whether you are a tea connoisseur or just a casual sipper, your visit to Aroma Tea Shop will make you smarter and your day better.\n\nTucked away on 6th, right off of the hustle and bustle of Clement, is the wide-windowed, yellow canopied storefront that can best be described as being to tea what the Library of Alexandria was to books prior to its tragic immolation.  This tiny storefront contains a magnificent collection of the finest and most desirable cured leaves of Camilia Senensis.\n\nThe store, as one of the owners Haymen kindly explained to me upon one visit, is set up in many ways like a modern dispensary.  Canisters of tea and a small selection of brewing and drinking-ware line the walls of this tiny tea shop.  The centerpiece of the store is a tasting bar, where up to four people can comfortably sit and sample teas of their choice or, better yet, teas recommended by whoever is working.\n\nYour dialogue with the host over tiny steaming cups of freshly brewed tea is the real heart and soul of the Aroma Tea Shop experience.  No matter who your host is, they are going to know everything you could possibly want to know about all of the available varieties, and they are more than happy to share this wealth of knowledge with anyone who cares to inquire.  \n\nIt's basically like going to a bar, except your bartender is serving you free samples of finely aged Scotch from his private reserves, which he picked up during his latest trip to Scotland, and telling you all about it.  And instead of getting wasted, you are being uplifted by the soothing smells and flavors of teas of all varieties.  Time flies as your senses are stimulated and your mind expanded by taste after taste of Aroma Tea Shop's carefully cultivated selection.\n\nMy recommendation is that you go when you've got time to kill.  I've easily ended up spending 45 minutes to an hour there every time I have gone, shooting the breeze, sipping brews, and educating myself one of the world's oldest and most popular beverages.  \n\nBe sure to buy a couple ounces and tip your host a dollar or two for providing a 5 star experience.  These people are experts without the snobbery, and their product is of the highest quality.", "author": "Max T."}

We liked it so much that we bought a bunch of fairly expensive (but delicious) tea, and even hung their business card up in our kitchen to remember to go back.\n\nHowever, the most recent time I was there, the experience was totally the opposite: I felt rushed, like they didn't want us there (we were the only customers on a sunny Sunday afternoon), and the lady was brusque and not friendly. However, we did (awkwardly) still sample and buy some tea. I love the mix-and-match bags, where you can buy a little bit of a bunch of different teas. They had a 5-for-$20 deal.

They were all amazing.  I had a bit of a Bubba Forest Gump moment--peach tea, coconut tea, green tea, blue tea, white tea...  The flavors and aromas were truly wonderful.  All of the flavors were so complex and fresh-tasting.  I've never seen nor tasted so many different blends.  I love tea, but I had never had tea taste so special.  Their tea is a real experience, not to mention the hilarious pictures on the loose leaf tea jars and super funny sayings on the wall.  This is a place for what I would call \"gifting tea.\"   They are high-end, top quality teas that feel like a special occasion.  In short, if you're broke, keep right on walking.  This is deep pocket tea, for sure.  It was a bit rich for my blood, but I could certainly taste a pronounced difference in quality.  \n\nThe owners go to China to source their teas themselves, and they are always looking for unique blends.  The teas are mostly loose leaf and in a state where you can actually identify what's in their blends.  I loved everything we tried, but the coconut tea really stands out as something memorable and unique. Honestly, all of the teas were very much memorable for me, and they turned my idea of tea on its head.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-10", "description": "Aroma Tea Shop is the place for Asian tea aficionados. It's appropriately located just off Clement Street (San Francisco's other Chinatown) on 6th Avenue. There's a second location in Chinatown. Thanks to Jessica T for introducing us to this place. I've been up and down Clement many times, but haven't explored several of its side streets. This is a unique find and it's been in business since 2005.\n\nAroma Tea Shop's Richmond store amounts to a single room filled with over 150 teas. I believe most of these are loose leaf, stored in canisters. For regular folks, the selection can be overwhelming. The main wall has five shelves filled to the brim. Each shelf contains 24 canisters, tightly lined up. The back wall has an additional three shelves containing about 40 additional canisters. The outside of each canister has an enlarged photo of the actual tea leaves, the food it may taste like, or a humorous picture or graphic.\n\nFor example, the \"Really Fresh Lemongrass\" tea is represented by a photo of lemongrass, the Cherry Rose Sencha tea is represented by a photo of cherries, and the Muscat Grape Oolong tea is represented by a photo of grapes and wine. Playful examples include the \"8 Immorals\" oolong tea sporting the Super 8 Motel graphic, the Yunnan Kung Fu Black Tea using the pixel cover art from the 8-bit Nintendo game Kung Fu, the \"Super Russian Caravan\" black tea using art from Communist Russia, and the popular \"Blue People King Grade\" tea featuring a photo of blue-shirted Best Buy employees.\n\nMost of the teas are sold in 4-ounce increments, though I did see some selling in 2-ounce increments. Tea types include white, green, black, oolong, jasmine, herbal, and pu-erh. Pu-erh tea is an aged and fermented dark tea from the Yunnan province in China. Each tea canister is displayed with a small, helpful information card with details on taste and country of origin. I think most of the teas come from China, Taiwan, and Japan. I did see one from France. Prices run the gamut from $9 to $120 (!) for 4 ounces.\n\nThis is a family-run business headed by the husband-wife duo of Haymen Da Luz and Ying Wu. They make trips to Asia to personally pick which teas to bring back. On a wall inside the shop, there's a giant photo of them at one of the tea leaf farms in Taiwan. There are photos of their two kids too. It's a humble, unpretentious business, unlike some hipster coffee bars or highfalutin gourmet tea retailers.\n\n\"Tea Man\" Haymen is quite the showman. He's a genuinely funny guy and seems skilled at his craft and very knowledgeable about tea. He and his wife regularly conduct free tea tastings at their special custom-built tasting counter. Haymen hosted our group's tea tasting where we sampled the Coconut Paradise green tea, the Muscat Grape oolong tea, the Meng Hai Big Leaf (1990) pu-erh tea, and the Blue People King Grade tea. He walked us through the flavors from earthy and roasted to sweet and fruity. The flavor profiles were distinctively different. I've never tasted such a wide range of teas in one sitting. The tasting reminded me of the coffee taster's flavor wheel (there's one for tea tasters too).\n\nAbout 10 teas are available hot or iced to go for $3.50 each. These include Muscat Oolong, Peach White Tea, Jasmine Milk Tea, and Hella Strong Chai (haha). You know it's from San Francisco when it has the word \"hella\" in it. In addition to tea leaves and ready-to-drink tea beverages, Aroma Tea Shop also carries tea pots, cups, trays, filters/strainers, bottles, and other various tea-related accessories.\n\nWhile I'm no tea expert (I'm just a bubble tea simpleton), I can appreciate the sheer variety of fine teas offered at this shop and recommend to anyone who happens to be visiting the neighborhood swing by for a free tasting. You'll probably learn something new and, who knows, perhaps find a new tea to take home.", "author": "Daniel B."}

In the span of a few hours we ate a wonderful meal, checked out some beautiful scenery, and found some amazing little stores. Of all the places we visited that day (and there were many!) Aroma Tea Shop was by far my favorite!\n\nAroma is a family ran business. I love that about them. The husband and wife team who were running the store were both very helpful and funny (the guy cracked me up, his wife was a little more on the reserved side; they balanced eachother out nicely). Our group was happily treated to many different samples of tea; ranging from muddy to fruit-tasting. There were tons of tea containers lining the walls and we were asked if we would like to sample different ones. During the entire sampling experience we were treated to jokes, the history of tea, and explanations of both what the tea does to/for you (health benefits) and price points. Furthermore, the man running the store explained how they make trips to China and Taiwan to visit the tea farms themselves so that they know they are importing the best quality of tea leaves. \n\nYou can buy tea by the ounce to take home, choose from many different types of prepackaged tea leafs, or treat yourself to a  hot or iced tea drink of your choice (per the hillarious sign don't expect boba). I didn't purchase a drink but several members of the group did; some for flavor and other to cure ailments (ie a tummy ache, which they said later on the tea really helped). They also have boxed and wrapped gift sets that you can purchase that would make a wonderful gift for someone who really enjoyed tea. \n\nAroma was by far one of my favorite places to visit on my weekend trip to San Francisco. The customer service was stellar, and something that I think more businesses should strive to model themselves after. Throughout all the information that was shared to us I felt like there was no pressure at all to purchase anything, and I really respect that. Although I don't see any trips to San Francisco for myself in the near future Aroma is definitely somewhere that I would recommend both visitors and locals check out. \n\n\n[Note: there is street parking, and also a small parking area on the curb a few buildings down].", "author": "Zoie H."}

I found the shop one day just walking around Clement street. \n\nThere are a couple ways you can shop here: \n1. Straight Forward - Come in, pick out your tea, they bag it, you pay and go.\n2. Like a Bar - Come in, sit and enjoy a tea tasting of various teas, hang out, buy what you need, and go at your leisure. \n\nI highly suggest #2. \nThe owners of the shop are very informative and interactive during the tea tasting. \n\nI usually buy White Jasmine Pearl Tea, the herbal tea, and occasionally their high-end specialty teas. \n\nThey also offer tea by the cup if you would like one to-go!", "author": "Debbie N."}

The delightful surprise aside from the incredible array of teas and blends is Haymen the owner - he is a super star & his passion for teas contagious.   Get ready to be thoroughly entertained if he is at the shop, I always leave knowing THAT much more about teas- he is like a wine connoisseur but of teas pointing out the \"buttery taste of this Oolong\" or the \"chocolatey finish to that Black tea\".   \nFirst thing Haymen does is pour you a glass of tea that happens to suit his fancy on that particular day which is a great way to start the tea lesson Grasshopper !\nI love his customer service and that he always sends me home with samples - he is very generous in that way and of course I always buy more than expected whenever I am there as a result.  That kind of customer service is refreshing & so hard to find these days. Honestly I knew nothing about teas and rituals and now I am turning into an avid student.  One of the most enchanting things Haymen told me was how musicians in China go to the tea fields to play the Guzheng instrument (a flat harpsichord which is the National instrument of China) to make the tea plants happy - that particular blend of tea is the Fujian Black tea (Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong) in case you want to taste what happy plants feel like.   \nAnother incredible thing I did not know is that ALL tea; Greens, Oolongs, PuErhs, Blacks, etc ALL come from the Camellia plant ! He also showed me pictures of 1000 year old tea trees (the bush turns into trees when they are that old) .  What separates the different types of teas is the processes of oxidation, drying or firing, rolling or withering as well as where the leaf is picked from in the plant (whether it is a bud or longer leaf) - AMAZING. I told my Mom this who is Chinese and she refused to believe me. \n\nI will admit the experience is not the same if Haymen is not there-no one rushes to offer you samples or cares about your experience - when I mentioned it this to him he explained that the girl who covers for him is his wife's family so essentially he is stuck with her (hilarious !)  \n I haven't had the same luck with the Chinatown location where I can tell they deal with a lot of tourists who probably just come in for free samples but I have never gotten the chance to meet Haymen's wife someone else was there the time I went.  Also, I hope they reprint the information flyer they used to give you with all the medicinal information about the teas including the five element chart so fundamental to Chinese medicine.   I suggest unless you know exactly what you want to call ahead  to make sure Haymen is there - he is what makes the place that much extra cool !", "author": "NancyChurro C."}

That alone gets +2 stars.  However, compared to most other places I buy lose-leaf tea the prices are ludicrously expensive, to the tune of 2x-4x more per oz than at other stores I've shopped at in SF.\n\nThey also refused to sell less than 2oz of tea from each bin.  This is a killer, as I want to grab a bunch of different teas to try at home, so that I can find the ones I like most.  A quick taste at the shop is ok but it only steeps for a few second as opposed to minutes at home, and a taste I might enjoy initially can end up being something I dislike after having it a few times.\n\nOverall, if the prices werent so crazy I would probably come back.

You can try anything, in fact, they'll keep asking if you want to try so you might as well. \n\nI only got the Earl Grey and Muscat Oolong - for now. The pricing is per 4 oz but that's a lot of tea. You can get just a 2 oz bag instead (enough to fill up a jam jar for Earl Grey, much more for the Muscat Oolong). $25 for the two.

For those that don't know, matcha tea is extremely high in antioxidants (whole leaf consumed) and is very easy to prepare and make.

The flavor profile is highly aromatic with a sweet undertone accompanied by a creamy mouthful of green tea zest. Additionally, after an arduous search on both ebay, amazon and competitive tea spots, Aroma Tea Shop's Uji Matcha's pricing is simply the best.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-01", "description": "BREWING THE BAY: Chinese and Taiwanese loose leaf teas, flavored teas (mostly fruity and floral)\n\nFantastic. Place.\n\nI've been to a lot of tea shops in my life and Aroma Tea Shop shattered my highest expectations--so much so that I have a sinking feeling that even IT won't be able to recreate its own amazing first experience the next time I go there. After all, they say nothing is ever as good as your first high....\n\nI could gush and rave about this place to the fullest extent, but then you'd be reading this review until the apocalypse. So instead, I will make use of my (useless) English degree and do my best to SUCCINCTLY convey why this place rocks so hard:\n\n1) It is a classic mom 'n' pop, family-run establishment: Haymen Da Luz and his lovely wife Ying Wu started Aroma seven years ago, and in between growing their family (they have an adorable son and beautiful daughter), they've grown their inventory, space and client base.\n\n2) Haymen: His hilarious, sardonic wit is outmatched only by his extensive knowledge (and obvious love) of tea. He's sarcastic and dry, but never obnoxious, snooty or condescending. Both novices and experts are made to feel welcome as he cheerfully steeps gaiwan after gaiwan of hot tea. When I was there, there was a young Caucasian woman seated next to me who was completely new to the world of tea. She worked at a tasting room in a winery, so her judgment of \"taste\" was skewed completely toward wine. Haymen never once made her feel left out and answered all of her questions with friendly assuredness.\n\n3) The selection of (mostly Chinese and Taiwanese) teas: Aroma packs a lot into a small space. Floor-to-ceiling shelves house large, bright, metal canisters of Asian teas of every varietal, the name and price clearly labeled on each canister along with a bright, colorful picture of the tea leaves. There are also cakes of pu-erh, boxes of flowering teas (perfect gifts for tea-loving friends) and discounted bags of various tisanes (e.g. lavender and rose combos). Which leads me to my next point....\n\n4) FREE, UNLIMITED TASTINGS OF YOUR CHOICE OF TEAS: Unlike the (awful) tea shops in Chinatown that offer a quick gongfu-like preparation of pre-selected, watered-down teas, Haymen encourages his customers to sample as many of the store's teas as they want, free of charge. This means that if you want to try premium oolong that sells for $80/4 oz, Haymen will happily go into the back room, lug out a giant box of tea leaves (the box is as big as a toddler) and steep as much of the expensive oolong for you to drink as you want. Not that anyone would make him do that.....*whistles*. In other, less complicated scenarios, you simply point to a canister and say you want to try that. Repeat until satisfied.\n\n5) The rest of the inventory: Aroma offers a great selection of reasonably priced Chinese and Taiwanese-style teaware. This is the place to go to buy whole gongfu sets or a la carte parts including gaiwans, teapots, brewing trays, tea picks, tea cups and wooden coasters. There are also glass teapots and one-touch tea makers. I found most of the teaware to be of good quality with beautiful colors and designs, in addition to being affordable. You now have no excuse to buy the overpriced teaware of soulless chains like Teavana.\n\n6) The brown frog that changes colors: Ask Haymen to show you if he doesn't automatically offer to. It's cute.\n\nGan Bei! :)", "author": "Josephine L."}

I didn't know there was such a thing as tea until I stopped drinking coffee a year ago.  Well, I knew there was tea, but I thought it began and ended with the 100 box of generic green tea, Lipton-style.  That was enough of a caffeine delivery system for me.\n\nBut come the loss of my beloved coffee--one day, all must either be consumed or part with their drug of choice, like some dysfunctional relationship--I suddenly realized that otherwise functional Lipton was tasting like grass-infused sawdust.\n\nSo I remembered going into the place and getting tea samples from Heymen, the punk rock tea master, at the amazing marble tea bar and thinking, hey, I should check that out again.  I went in and got about 10 small samples, and trying them at my office, identifying which I liked best and especially which infused caffeine most effectively.\n\nGoing there now, to refill my stock of smokey and powerful green teas (what I've learned is my preference), always is a highlight of my week.  Heymen is such a knowledgeable and unassuming character (last time he points to the T-shirt on the way that says, simply, \"Tea Master,\" and says, \"Yeah, that's all you need.\"), yet with a wicked punky edge, who is so thoroughly and effortless a master of his trade, that I can ask any stupid question, or broad request, and he's able to interpret and respond immediately.

Whenever I meet up with friends at bars,  I like to match their shots and overly sweet cocktails with glasses of water. By the end of the night - I'm feeling alert, revived, and energetic - and they're sluggish, tired, and ready to go home.\n\nRecently, with the wave of colds and flu that been going around this city, I've become even more focused on staying hydrated and keeping my body healthy with antioxidants.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to accomplish this - is by drinking tea.\n\nAroma Tea Shop is an ideal tea oasis for learning about all of the health benefits of tea,  a great spot to buy high quality tea, and even a unique spot to be moderately social as well, while being schooled in the wonder that is tea.\n\nAroma Tea Shop has a small darling tea bar area where you can sample teas for free, while you decide on a tea - that suits you. Throughout the sampling process - Haymen will educate you about each tea and all of the intricacies about that particular tea. \n\nWe asked him for a recommendation and he spoke highly of the Blue People Oolong. He was right. It's wonderful. It coats your throat with a slightly sweet after-taste and after just a couple of small cups - I instantly felt a surge of energy. My skin even felt smoother and more moisturized.\n\nIf you're looking for a distinct tea adventure in which you can learn first-hand about wondrous teas, without pretension, and with a couple of spoonfuls of wit -  then come to Aroma Tea Shop. \n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

Let's go! \n\nThere are several tea shops in the city but rare are the ones who will take the time to not only allow you to smell and view the leaves, but also let you taste any one that you are interested in and be extremely knowledgeably about every single variety sold.  \n\nDo you want to know what area of the world this tea is from?  How it compares to a hundred other teas?  When it was cultivated and what the actual tea farm looks like?  Haymen, the owner, knows all.   It means a lot to me that I am buying product from someone who has been to the source.  To be clear, this tea room specializes in mostly Asian teas.   When faced with a huge selection with crazy names like Dong Ding, Blue People, and Iron Goddess, Haymen is like a tour guide to exploring all of these wonderful varieties.  I grew up drinking several Chinese and Japanese teas but this place introduced me to dozens I have never heard  of.  For instance, it is amazing to taste each one and realize how drastically different one tea is from another even if they are both green.  \n\nWhen you walk into the shop, you'll notice a marble bar with small stools.  That's the tasting station.  The best part about shopping here is pulling yourself up to a stool and letting Haymen introduce you to new and interesting teas like Longevity Eyebrow.  You can watch him brew the tea, have you smell the leaves both dry and wet, and then taste a small amount.  Have I mentioned that Haymen is hilarious?  He has a great sense of humor and sets a very relaxed atmosphere where you can feel free to socialize with the other tasters and  share opinions. \n\nSince the tea is loose leaf, you can choose to purchase by weight or by price.  For instance, I can choose to buy 2 oz. of a tea or just ask that they give me $20 worth.  \n\nMy favorite tea is the Supreme Taiwan Jin Xuan Milk Oolong.  This tea is so good that I am crazy addicted to it now.   Brewed between 30-60 seconds,  it has a soft green floral taste with this buttery flavor to it that is completely unexpected and yet natural to this particular tea.  Please stop by the shop and ask to taste it. I guarantee you will never have had anything like it before and once you try it, you'll be blown away by it's uniqueness.  I'm usually not one to lay down a lot of money for tea but I gladly do for this one.   You can check out this tea here on their online store: \nhttp://www.aromateashop.com/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=85", "author": "Courtney Y."}

I wanted mint black tea but he only had peppermint black tea. I was still impressed as most places don't even have that. I tasted around 5 teas. The lychee black tea was exceptionally good and the coconut black tea was exotic with a silkiness to it. \n\nThe \"human oolong\" tea wasn't anything special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-07", "description": "I was first introduced to this place by my sister who had a deal for 30-50% off the total purchase. Even though this place is small and only has two locations (Clement Street in the Inner Richmond and Washington Street in Chinatown), I am really glad the manager/Tea Master is willing to get exposure for the shop through online/mobile deals! \n\nTea Master, Haymen, has always made me feel welcomed from the minute I set foot in the shop. Walking in, you'll immediately notice no free space along the walls because the walls are stocked to the brim with different kinds of teas--organized based on the leaves and flavors. The shop also carries teapots, strainers, cute tea sets, thermos bottles, and more to complement your tea leaves purchase. Haymen always welcomes visitors to come sit with him and sample teas. He is extremely generous with his portions and endlessly lets you taste-test specialty teas to your delight (and if you're lucky enough to come when he is pouring tea for other customers, he'll always pour you a cup of what they're having too)! It's like he creates a tea party for all customers to pause their day to sit, take a breather, and relax with some tea. Haymen has a vast amount of knowledge of tea leaves, tea flavors, the leaves' origins and age, and how to attain the best flavor from each particular tea. He also demonstrates the proper way to coat your tea pots and steep your tea leaves right in front of you. It's pretty entertaining to watch him do his demonstrations, especially because at the end of it, you know he'll be serving you whatever he is working on!\n\nI have an inclination to lean towards green and white teas. I originally started with Oolong tea (the shop has a HUGE variety of Oolong teas and unfortunately I don't remember the exact name of the one I bought!) but I have definitely grown to love the White Fur Silver Needle tea. As the name suggests, it is a white tea. In addition to considering the variety of tea flavors (such as one particular white or green tea or another), you also should consider the age of the leaves you purchase. I originally started with an aged Silver Needle tea, but after I tried young leaves of Silver Needle tea, I have never gone back! The younger leaves are such a beautiful, vibrate green color and the aroma is slightly fruity (whereas the Oolong teas would smell more woodsy). Young White Fur Silver Needle tea leaves produce a lighter shade of brown compared to green and black teas when hot (NEVER boiling) water is added and it leaves a more subtle aftertaste in your mouth compared to green and black teas. \n\nSince I don't drink coffee at all, tea has become my alternative caffeine booster in the mornings at work. Haymen packs 1-oz. or 2-oz. bag(s) of leaves in a Zip-loc bag and sticks a label with the name of the tea on it. The label also gives instructions on how to make the most of this particular tea. I can't give specific prices of the various teas because they vary based on the age of the leaves, the type of tea, etc. But I know a 2-oz. bag of young White Fur Silver Needle tea leaves costs roughly $30. I have been here three times now and not once has Haymen charged me at full price. The last time I came here, I bought two 2-oz. bags of tea (one was the young White Fur Silver Needle and the other was another white tea, Dragon's Mill or something like that) and Haymen only charged me $16 for both! This is already after I had sampled at least 3 cups of teas prior to my purchase!\n\nThe price may bother some, but the way I see it is you come to Aroma Tea Shop knowing you want tea that you cannot find in a regular supermarket. The other reason would be you yourself cannot properly distinguish teas and would like an expert to help you pinpoint the exact flavors that satisfy your palette. While parking may be difficult to find around Clement Street (meters only for the most part), it shouldn't deter you from giving this place a try at least once (if not to purchase anything, at least to stop and get a drink after dehydrating, long shopping sprees around Clement Street). Overall, the customer service is UNBEATABLE and I have never left this tea shop unhappy!", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I'm not just talking about tea shops, I mean I've never been to a place to buy something and come away as happy as from Aroma Tea Shop.  I've also never seen a shop owner (Haymen) so happy with his job (which is almost certainly what makes it such an awesome place).\n\nI've been back at least 3 times since, every time I discover something new, every time I come away with a couple of new teas.   Plenty of other reviewers here have already detailed the vast selection of teas, their own preferences, etc., so here are \"just the facts, ma'am\":\n\n- TIP:  I recommend you taste a few premium teas and buy one, you won't regret it.  However if you want some low-price \"everyday\" teas, Haymen keeps a variety of low-price (but still decent quality full leaf) teas on low shelves opposite the tasting bar.  I can attest that the Iron Goddess, Milk, and Dragonwell from there are all good.  $5 a bag! (3-4oz)  Cheaper than some bagged teas, WTF?!?  Occasionally some of the premium teas end up here too if they don't sell well (doesn't mean they aren't good, just not popular).\n\n- If you don't know the first thing about tea, that's fine, just tell Haymen exactly that and ask him what he recommends you taste, he's completely unassuming.\n\n- Most of the selections are Chinese or Taiwanese (some Japanese too, not sure if they carry non-Asian varieties).  \n\n- If your preference is Indian varieties (Assam, Darjeeling, etc.), just say so, Haymen will recommend some Chinese black tea equivalents that will make your mouth happy.  \n\n\nP.S.  I have a Ying De Hong tea he recommended that is comparable to a Darjeeling in taste and smell.  Taste tested against Peet's \"extra fancy\" Darjeeling, it blows it away, and is about the same price I think.  Have you ever seen a black tea that has full, completely intact leaves post-steeping?

The sample the lady made for me was awesome, but I'm on my 15th brew and I still have been unable to replicate the flavor of the sample!  Even following the directions on the package with a variety of brewing vessels, the tea tastes uninspired and boringly astringent. YAWN. But then again it gets me wired.

This stuff is the real deal, with a fruity smell  and a pungent sweetness with a looooooong (oo-loooong, get it?) finish that could rival the half-life of Selenium-82.  When I first sampled the tea, this lingering sweetness was VERY reminiscent of a pseudo-sweet taste sensation, like stevia or aspartame. BUT DON'T GET IT TWISTED: there is no aspartame in this brew, that peptide loses its tastes hot water (probably due to temperature hydrolysis). Rather, this sensation is due to Glycyrrhizin (also known as (3)-30-hydroxy-11,30-dioxoolean-12-en-3-yl 2-O--D-glucopyranuronosyl--D-glucopyranosiduronic acid) from the licorice plant.

This is significant because:\n\n1. my parents travel to China to buy tea. It is one of their reasons for flying their butts out there.\n2. everyone in my family has a cupboard dedicated to tea and teaware\n3. buying tea from other stores gives you teabags with crappy tea, or whole tea that is crazy expensive and limited, or a BS experience of 'americanized' tea talk.\n4. their tea is fantastic and great value for how much tea you get. huge tins everywhere.\n\nI love the guy that runs this shop. Free tea-tastings are such a great idea to find what you like from the 30~ varieties of oolong and pu-erh. There are some crazy tastes like milk oolong, phoenix oolong or orchid oolong, etc. \n\nIf you want to get educated on tea, check this place out.

I went in to buy an obscure tea that I wanted which seemed hard to find elsewhere. I was not expecting to have such a good time or stay for over an hour talking to the owner. This is the most fun I've had shopping for tea in at least 5 years and I've been a pretty intense tea drinker for about 7. \n\nHow it works is you go in and the owner, Haymen, asks you what sort of tea you are looking for. Then he'll bring out a few different types for you, tell you about them, and make samples for you. \n\nThis and another shop in Chinatown are run jointly by Haymen and his wife, and they do it all. The frequently go to China and Taiwan to buy teas directly themselves from buying the tea from farmers to running their shops in SF. The fact that they go straight to the farmers and choose what teas are worth buying means you are getting some of the best tea you possibly could without physically going to China yourself.\n\nWhat makes the experience even better is the passion that Haymen brings to his work. Like I said, I came in not even looking to buy any normal tea. To be honest, I've become really frustrated with tea over the past few years because I felt like it is impossible to get good tea in the states. He started by making me some Longjing and it made me remember how it is supposed to taste and why I liked it so much to begin with. From there we just talked for a while and I sampled quite a few different teas and can say that across the board the quality of tea he sells is superb. I left with a few different types of teas and I've been drinking (and enjoying!) more tea in the past week than I have in the past few years. \n\nA must visit for tea lovers!", "author": "Cadmium C."}

Green tea, Black tea, Oolong, Ceylon, English, White tea, Chai, I love them all. Tea bags are good for convience but horrible for fully experiencing a tea. I used to only drink tea in tea bags but after switching to loose leaf theres no going back for me. A cup of Green tea everyday is very healthy for you so i recommend it.  I found ATS on yelp and decided to go and check it out . As i entered i was intimidated , there were so many different types of tea on the wall. I didn't know where to start!\n\nHaymen offers free tea tastingsand based on one's you try or are familar with Haymen can make suggestions and let you try even more teas. It was on a Wednesday that i walked in, mid afternoon and it wasn't a very busy day. I ended up staying there for about 2hrs talking with Haymen and trying a lot of different types teas. We found some common history between us which is how we became friends. I am a regular customer at ATS and can't stop coming back when i need to feed my tea craving. \n\nAnother reason that really keeps me coming back is the wealth of knowledge about tea that Haymen has is amazing. Everytime i go in i learn something new and learn tips on how to get the best out of my tea. Haymen even goes to China to visit the farms. What more dedication can you have? Haymen is a tea master for sure! So if you are in need of some good loose leaf tea come by and pay Haymen a visit. You will definitely enjoy your Tea experience here!", "author": "Jonathan W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-21", "description": "TL;DR version: OK for a free tasting, but be very cautious of buying any of the tea here.\n\nTo preface this review, I've been drinking \"fine\" Chinese and Japanese teas for nearly three years now, and am experienced in many aspects of tea culture and appreciation. This being said, Aroma Tea Shop has developed a reputation among other tea shops in the area that is quite different from its current ratings on Yelp. Aroma Tea is fine as an introduction to the Chinese gongfu way of brewing loose-leaf tea, but I would be extremely wary of buying tea for several reasons:\n\n1.) Haymen, the owner, is very fast-paced and has his own very dry sense of humor as noted by many reviews which put me at a bit of unease. You may feel like you're being sold a used car at times.\n\n2.) Price and quality are very disparate in many of the teas sold in the shop. As stated by other reviewers, the prices for many flavored teas are highly elevated for the quality (i.e. sprayed with artificial flavorings). Many of the traditional teas also are lacking in quality, yet are at a similar price to many reputable online and brick-and-mortar shops known for consistent quality.\n\n3.) And this is really my major complaint: HONESTY. I tasted several teas in the shop, all from Taiwan, and ended up purchasing 2 oz of Jin Xuan to brew at home. This was done literally behind our backs by Haymen's wife, so we trusted that we would receive the correct one. Immediately after reaching my house, I weighed the contents of the bag on a food scale at home (my habit in dealing with new tea purveyors) and found the weight of the bag was included in the two ounces I purchased (not tared correctly). \n\nAfter brewing several separate times under different conditions, I came to the conclusion that the tea that I purchased must have been different from that which I tasted in the store, as it had a very artificial strawberry flavor not present before. I took the tea back to the shop and told Haymen my concern, but he insisted the tea was 100% naturally flavored, citing a quick google search he did in the store, afterwards dragging out the box from which he scooped my tea and showed me the \"Made in Taiwan\" print on the outside box to prove its authenticity.\n\nI wasn't fully convinced, and took the tea to a local tea shop to have them assess the quality of the teas side-by-side and the difference was like night and day. Not only was there an intense artificial flavor, but it was apparently there was a storage problem with the tea at some point, as the wet leaves smelled strongly of brewers yeast. Trustworthiness is really key in buying tea, since you have to rely on the vendor giving you accurate information on what you are actually drinking. In my opinion any vendor who sells artificially flavored teas under the guise of fine tea has lost my patronage as well as my respect. \n\nIf you're looking for an introduction to Chinese teas, I would suggest other shops in the Bay Area such as Red Blossom, Taste, or Teance where the owners are not only extremely friendly, but are honestly interested in educating people and sourcing really high quality teas. Please learn from my review, and don't make the mistake I did!\n\nFull Disclosure: I do not work in the tea or beverage industry, but have patronized all three shops mentioned above.", "author": "James P."}

He overheard me asking for a particular tea that that shop didn't have and he gave me his card to check out his place.\nI was surprised to find out that he offered free tea tastings daily. I'm not a tea person, but hey it's free and Haymen is quite a charming charismatic fella. \nHe's definitely tea guru: he explains the effects, benefits, origins, processes, tastes, possible cocktail concoctions, etc. for every tea. He gives tips on how to properly brew tea and tells interesting anecdotes. Bottom line, he's good company and puts on quite a tea show--I've never met a person who is this passionate about tea. It makes me wonder what he's like when there is actually a group of people that come in for a \"tea party.\" \nThe inside is very vibrant--huge tea canisters all around, fancy looking tea sets and decor. And of course, a tea bar to accentuate the separate seating area.\n\nI recall a \"blue people oolong\" tea he served which I thought was pretty good and a \"pu-er\" which he described as tasting like dirt. I'm not sure which tea(s) it was, but I was wired when I left the shop and felt a \"high\" well into the next night.\n\nThe teas are VERY pricey-- ranging from $10 up to $50 for 4oz, depending on the tea. I'm sure it's because they're imported straight from source and only the best loose-leaf tea you can get though. The berry tea he had did taste a lot more \"fresher\" than the cheap bulk packaged brand I was seeking.\n\nI bought a Thai iced tea with boba to-go for about $2.50 (which I also got to try prior to buying it). It too, tasted much fresher and crisper than other Thai-iced teas.\n\nHaymen is very knowledgable and passionate about tea, that, along with this deep voice is enough to lure me back here for Thai iced tea and probably more tea-tastings (even though I'm not a tea person--seriously, what do they put in that stuff!?)!

The tea is expensive, but it tastes so good, and you can steep it all at least 2-3 times. You can sample a bunch of tea while you're there, and the shopkeeper always drops an interesting little sample in your bag when you leave. I love the Blue People Oolong. Their Jasmine Pearl is excellent--I forget which one I picked up but I think it was the cheaper version. There's also a terrific herbal berry tea that I need to buy. Every other tea I've sampled has been great.", "author": "Tim G."}

Squeezed amongst the day markets, Cantonese-style cafes, and medicine shops, Aroma seems like it would be a safe bet when trying to locate quality tea and a knowledgeable staff.  However, in a city of wonderful tea shops, this one is greatly lacking.  \n  Aroma is an odd collection of overpriced, low quality teas that are poorly stored (glass jars are a \"No No\" as tea goes stale in about a week if stored this way).  What all of this means is a nasty taste left in my mouth.  The only saving grace they had was that they were less offensive than the Vital Tea stores on Chinatown (no barking salesmen, yet one does still feel like they are being sold a used car).  Beyond that, I feel that their staff are somewhat more interested in making money off of tea than making a tasty cup and lasting customers.\n  I've been here several times in an attempt to see if any change for the better has occurred and, alas, nothing has come of it.  Sadly, a \"meh\" sort of tea shop with \"meh\" sort of tea.", "author": "Scott N."}

I have been buying finer Chinese teas for years and still have a lot to learn.\nI enjoyed the tea bar, i will even go as far as to say some of the teas are ok...I purchased 2 of the most popular teas from China, one green: a Dragon well (good but a bit pricey) and a Pu'erh. For those in the know, the dark fermented tea known as Pu'erh is the Bordeaux of red wines. It is popular, prized, and often sold in \"cakes\" and can fetch $$$. Much of the Pu'erh on the market is \"counterfitted\"...what is true about Cuban cigars from the Mexican border is true about Pu'erh. They suggested a few cakes, and I settled on a $50 cake based on their recommendations, which should buy you a nice cake. I think you understand what i am driving at here, but when I first brewed it, it had a fishy taste, no smoky/marshmellowy taste which is characteristic of this tea, and found straw in it. When one pays this kind of $ for a cake, you have to rely on the seller, who should be buying from a reputable dealer. In fairness to them, maybe they did not know what they had but I guess I will never know, and will always wonder. What I do know is that other retailers of Pu'erh (i will not name their competitors, there are only 2 in SF) have always sold me good cakes, and go through great lengths to make sure they are good. \nOn the up side, they do have a nice collection of clay pots at reasonable prices. \nBTW, this Blue People is ok,...to each his own, but again have to wonder why it's so popular there...it has a slight taste of Anis", "author": "christian i."}
