Could have been a bit flakier but the custard was nice. Ate the wife cake which was ok but didn't seem to have enough winter melon.

Maybe I have weird taste.... but I like the egg tarts here better than the ones at Golden Gate Bakery and even in famous bakeries that I stopped by when I was visiting HK. The egg tarts here are warm, sweet, and pretty much just eggy goodness mmmmm. The pork buns are also really good and solid! I had some of their other breads (coconut bun, sponge cakes, other soft breads, etc), and they're all decent but nothing too amazing. Will definitely return for the egg tarts and pork buns.

I've passed by it many times and have always found it to be packed with local grandmas and granddads enjoying a coffee and an egg tart. Everyone here seems to have a coffee and exactly one egg tart that they are nursing. Anyway, a couple of days ago I decided to try their egg tarts.\n\nI was helped by a sweet old lady. When I asked for my standard order of 3 egg tarts I was told to get two more so that I could get a box. No problem, I'll get five. I almost fainted when I was asked for $4, which made these like 80c each. Exactly half of what you would pay at Golden Gate (that is when they are not on vacation of-course). It doesn't get cheaper than this.\n\nTheir egg tarts are a little different than Golden Gate. The crust is not the crunchy flaky type and the custard is a little firmer and sweeter when compared to Golden Gate's. These are like the tarts that you get in Eastern Bakery or Wong Lee Bakery. I personally prefer the tarts from AA Bakery or Yummy which are more like Golden Gate but that is a personal choice.\n\nOverall this was pretty good. I guess I need to stop by more often and get some more stuff from them and that is exactly what I will do in the near future.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

A lot of other places sell it for $9, though, they were only selling it for $3. Coming from Toronto, I can usually get a bigger pack for $3, so i didn't buy it. \n\nI got the wife biscuit/cake, almond cookie and the sponge cake. My, oh my, the wife cake is a five star. The pastry was absolutely delicious as it was SOFT, not too rough on the edge, the outermost skin did not come off, it didn't taste a bit rough. The inside wintermelon paste was not sweet, there was enough filling, absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS. These are sold 2 for $1, so cheap!\n\nThe sponge cake was pretty good, it had a lot of egg in it which enhanced the taste. However, I would say it's a little more wet than the sponge cakes I normally eat, because when I put it out for the third day, it started turning a little soggy.\n\nTHE ALMOND COOKIES WERE BIGGER THAN MY FACE. Oh my goodness. These were the largest almond cookies I have ever seen! They have walnuts on them and were just MASSIVE.

Mother ate it and said it was one of the best tasting wife cakes she EVER had, not too sweet with enough flakiness. Because mother knew I went to SF every so often, it was engraved in my list of things to do is to bring home a dozen (or two) back to LA.\n\nI've been here twice, and both times that I have walked in, I was PROBABLY the younger customer. Lots of grandmas and grandpas sit around and chit chat, just like how any eatery place in Los Angeles Chinatown would have it. Placed an order for two dozen wife cakes and told them that I was taking them back home to LA. I had requested to put them in a bag, so it would be easier for me to stash away; instead they said not to worry and gave me the standard pink box, stuffing 30 cakes. The cakes itself were 2 for a dollar, which is a steal, in comparison to every other place in San Francisco AND any place that sells these kind of baked goods in Los Angeles. I believe the server gave me freshly baked wife cakes, since she had probably emptied out two trays just for my order. \n\nService was great; granted I did take advantage of my Cantonese speaking skills.

Their prices are pretty cheap, only $1 for a char siu bao, but that's reflected in the quality, with barely any meat inside the bun. Just lots of air. The sponge cake was also $1, and pretty good, the inside was nice and soft and spongy. I would probably stick to the more bready substances rather than the meaty ones because flour is cheap and they can't exactly skimp on flour.", "author": "Jenny W."}

Two very friendly ladies in front who greet you in Cantonese with a (translation) \"Hey, pretty lady or good looking guy.  What can I help you with today?\"  They always have a smile and look you in the eyes unlike some other places in Chinatown.  So how can you turn them down when they say get a couple more of the same to make a half or whole dozen.  Good salesmanship.  If you don't want more, just say \"maybe next time.\"  Also, if you are not ready to order and looking thru the display case, don't be surprised if they help other people in line behind you first.  This seems to be the norm in SF Chinatown but at least when you are ready, they give you there undivided attention.\n\nBest egg custard tart, sponge cake, cr\u00e8me filled sponge cake roll, coconut cr\u00e8me rolls I've had.  Always brings back fond memories of when my mom would bring these pastries home after working in the city when I was younger.  Not overly sweet like at GGB where a line outside does not necessarily equate with greatness. Also, bigger is not better, just bigger.  You have to go to places like this where you see the locals eating, esp. elderly Chinese people. My mom used to try other places but she always came back to this bakery.  My go to place to bring back a box of egg custard tarts for co-workers.  They disappear almost immediately.\n\nYes, the bakery has lots of stuff not on display but be honest, you are most likely only going to ask for items you have eaten here or somewhere else and liked in the past.  And these are in the display cases.  If it's not displayed, it's probably not their specialty anyways and you'll go away dissatisfied.  Yes, they make baked BBQ pork buns but this is not a dim sum place.  It's okay but the filling is not as good as some other places.  My mom used to get these at some other place in Chinatown.  Pineapple bun (no pineapple inside) is okay too but I never liked this style of bun since sweet on top but dense and bready for the rest.  Preserved duck egg bun - not for the faint of heart.  The only other buns I know about are small steamed red bean bun or steamed sweet egg custard bun which I have never seen sold at this place but at dim sum restaurants.  I think that these only taste good hot and out of the steamer.  Would check out one of those dim sum carryout places if interested.", "author": "Ming H."}

Clearly I didn't know what I was really wanting so I pointed to the tarts. Sensing it was a bun I wanted, she came out with this bun with a yellowish crumbly top. I insisted it was the tart I wanted. But she gave me both after saying \"this tart...this bun...custard inside\". I got it then. I was worried about that crumbly stuff but walked out with 2 items after paying $1.50. Ate the expected egg custard tart first and YUCK. This thing tasted like fluffy scrambled eggs in a flaky crust, not like a dessert at all. No sugar in that tart and the consistency was way too much like jello and not soft. I ate it but it was like eating breakfast again. I then was less excited about that custard bun thing. Well, I was wrong!! That was absolutely divine. It tasted like a Boston Creme donut inside and the crumbly yellow stuff was sweet and complimentary to entire \"bready\" bun! It was so good I went elsewhere yesterday for another \"custard bun\" only to find out that there is an actual REGULAR custard bun (without crumbly top) and PINEAPPLE custard bun and Coconut custard bun. I realized ONLY then that my custard bun experience was actually a Pineapple custard bun and not regular. Either way, yesterday I got the latter at A&K bakery on Stockton.

When you toast them in your toaster oven to a certain point, the sugar coating is soft and gooey. If you toast it past that point, it gets crisp. I like them best when the sugar coating is soft and gooey.\n\nThe other important component of all sweet baked buns aside from their sugar coating is the bread, and their bread wins me over because it's soft, fluffy, and melts in your mouth.

It's a bit more in the cut since it's not on the main streets like Grant or Stockton but it makes it better to enter because you aren't feeling like you're in a stock market exchange holding your dollar bills out trying to get what you want amongst all the chinese folks who actually know the language...  you're in an advantage!\n\nSo you walk in, and there a bunch of Chinese grandmas in the front and more Chinese grandpas in the back all enjoying the tasty baked goods and coffee.  I love it, it actually reminds me of my future once I become a grandpa, but ain't happening for another 30+ years.  Haha!  Finding your local neighborhood bakery and enjoying the company of your old time friends over what used to be cocktails and beer in your 20s which is now coffee and pork buns.\n\nAnyways, pork buns at 0.70 cents, self-serve coffee at $1.25, chinese cookies at 0.25 cents, cheese rolls at 0.60 cents, etc.  Nearly all their baked goods are under $1 for one.  They taste really good too!  I enjoy coming here and the 2 women always try to get me to buy more... it's quite funny actually!  Happens all the time!  Anyways, while I live in Nob Hill, I'll still try to find out more spots in the bustling China Town but I'll always make my way back here...  Check it out!", "author": "Limzer L."}

The cocktail bun is what I remember because a long narrow bun with sugar inside, I mean a lot of sugar, but nice and warm, kept in a warming oven.  If you get lucky, you get some that the rack they just pulled from the oven.  Now, those pineapple buns, they don't  have any pineapple  in them, it's just a name.  It's a bun with sugar melted on top.  The pork bun is ok, big but the pork is not high grade, meaning sometimes bits a fat, it's ok to spit out.  They have other stuff like moon cakes if you are adventurous.  Ask them to let you look at the hot b us inside the warming oven and you decide.

Chinatown may seem dead on a Saturday morning if you don't know where they hide the good stuff. At 70 cents apiece (as of 3.29.14), this is probably the best deal you're going to get for an egg custard in Chinatown. I figured this must be a pretty good bakery because I didn't see anyone inside who looked like a tourist. There are about 4-5 tables inside that were all taken by people who, I'm assuming, were from the neighborhood. They must know best, right? The woman behind the counter was very nice and spoke English very well (spoke Chinese to her anyway...). The egg custards were fresh and and the crust was perfect. There were several other types of pastries and cakes to choose from. I only take away one star because, well, it's Chinatown. It's very old. I don't expect a lot and it doesn't bother me but some may not consider many of the restaurants in Chinatown to be the cleanest. But, hey, what do you want?

I usually order the oatmeal raisin bun and sesame seed bun for a grand total of 75 cents!  My other favorites are the cocktail bun and Mexican bun.  Yum! \n \nThe only problem with this place is that you need to know what pastries you want ahead of time and it's a big plus if you speak the language (I think that pretty much applies to most of the places in Chinatown).  They don't have all their pastries laid out on the display with labels in English like many Chinese bakeries, so you can't point what you want.

It turned out to be a really traditional bakery that sells Hong Kong-style pastries. As a Hong Kong native, I crave Hong Kong-style pastries every now and then and after trying numerous places over the Bay area, I think it's one of the best. The almond cookie was infused with almond flavor (often missing at many other places), crunchy yet not greasy. I also tried their pineapple bun, custard bun, sweet raisin roll, and spring onion roll and they were all pretty good. I'd say the pineapple bun had less filling that I expected, but the bun itself was huge. The lady manning the counter was very friendly the last time I went there probably it was past 7 pm and the place was pretty quiet. I speak Cantonese and we even chatted a bit. The place really reminds me of what I perceived Hong Kong to be like in the 60s and 70s, so if nothing else, go check out this place and sit at one of the tables with a cup of coffee or Hong Kong-style milk tea just to get a feel of the ambiance.", "author": "Ed C."}
