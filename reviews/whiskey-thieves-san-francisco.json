It was on the nicer end as a dive bar, the place was very clean! Pretty much the only thing divey about it was the random pool table in the back of the room and the dark ambiance. We came here early afternoon on a Saturday, so it wasn't busy at all. The bartender was nice enough, but he wasn't especially personable. Surprisingly for a place with \"Whiskey\" in its name, this place didn't actually have that extensive of a whiskey list, so that was the disappointing part... But the prices for the drinks we did end up getting were very reasonable! \n\nFor the reasonable prices, I can see myself coming back here, but at the same time it is also out of the way and may not be worth the hassle.", "author": "Evelynn C."}

After yelping nearby places, I found Whiskey Thieves. I've had this place bookmarked for some time, so we made the walk from the Financial District to the Tenderloin. We got here on Thursday, July 14th around 8:45pm.\n\nThis place is divey, but I kind of loved it. They had a good selection of bourbon, rye, whiskey, and beer. I just let my friend order while I found a table. Ended up finding a small table past the bar to the right. My friend got us shots of bourbon (?) and a brown ale. It was nice sipping on both while catching up. We hadn't hung out, just the two of us in years, so we had a lot of catching up to do. Whiskey Thieves has a jukebox and the music can get a little loud, but we were still able to have a conversation.\n\nNice laid back bar. They have a pool table as well if you'd like to play a game.

I asked the bartender to recommend one, and he let me taste three different bourbons all within my price range so I could find one I really liked.

In this part of town?  I was fully expecting this to be a hipster dive.  \n\nThank goodness Whiskey Thieves proved me wrong.  The crowd was a mix of post-workday office workers, bike messengers, a sprinkling of hipsters, and so on...  My bud made introductions to his friend, and I took a seat with them at the bar.  \n\nThe salt n' vinegar kettle-cooked chips-munching redheaded bartender comes up and asks what I want.  Being the complete space cadet I can be at times, I blurted, \"What whiskies do you have?\"\n\nShe gives me an, \"ok, smartass...\" look, as I facepalm myself.  \n\nI regain my composure and ask, \"Would you happen to have anything smoky like Lavagulin?\"\n\n\"What price range would you like to work with?\"\n\n\"Let's keep it around $10, and surprise me if you would, please.\"\n\nShe comes back with her pick, pops the stopper with one hand, hands me the bottle with the other, and tells me it's ok to nose it.  I do as much, and a smile blooms on my face as I catch a whiff of peat, smoke, and brine.  My bartender croons, \"Shall I continue?\"\n\nI nod entranced, like a guy having his first set of real life tits fall upon his virgin eyes.

Bourbon specifically. Secondly, a little birdie promised me that the juke box contained The Cramps' \"Let's Get $#@%ed Up.\" I love that song. One of my buddies got an old juke box, loaded his favorite records into it, and would start a night of drinking with that Cramps song. Best drinking song ever. I wanted to go to the bar just to play that song! Tom R.'s MeetUp group finally brought me here last night. \n\nAs someone who became an orphan at a young age, I learned how short, valuable, and fragile our time is. As such, I decided that I would rather reget the things that I have done rather than the things that I have not. In short: take risks and learn from your mistakes. But, ugh, sonofabitch, I really really really really really regret waiting until my last month and a half in the Bay Area to finally get my ass to this beauty of a bar. A beauty it is too...a true diamond in the rough of the Tenderloin.\n\nThose who know me well know how much I love whiskey. You should have seen my reaction when I saw the availble whiskeys. Eyes popping out of my head like those on a tightly-clenched squeeze toy....anxious smile of anticipation like that of a little kid on Christmas morning...I cried and came at the same time. Truly epic. I was too overwhelmed and I just stuck with something safe...the Maker's Manhattan on the rocks.\n\nLemme tell you, the bartenders aren't thrifty with their pours either. For the first time, I actually was filled with liquid courage..........I finally told my ex exactly why I left him. Maybe he'll be a better man because of it. Maybe he's a lost cause. Whatever, I got, like, three or four numbers last night. But that totally doesn't matter. (Hot guys like this bar, ladies.) What does matter is that this place is super awesome and I am sad that I will be leaving it behind this summer. \n\nThen again, are we really suprised that I dig this place?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-07", "description": "Ye gods, does the Tenderloin host some great bars. In the interest of full candour, I was pretty drunk when I got here thanks to three delicious cocktails and a shot of Fernet Branca, which the bartender at Koko Cocktails asserted was part of the authentic SF experience. As I tottered my way over from there to here, a homeless guy helpfully schooled my companion in basic etiquette by yelling at him, \"You take care of that angel now! Man, why aren't you walking on the outside? Walk on the outside!\" This is also part of the authentic SF experience. However, I agree. My friend should have walked his lanky self on the outside of the pavement to protect me from the noxious contents of a chamberpot being emptied overhead, or its modern equivalent, the drive-by shooting. \n\nIn short, I was drunk and had been described as an angel by a homeless guy, so I was in a great mood. Whiskey Thieves only served to improve that mood, because it had an enormous quantity of whiskey, of a variety of provenances and shapes and colours and flavours, but all uniformly alcoholic and reasonably-priced. They also had $4 draught beer and a $7 PBR or Tecate and Kentucky bourbon shot special. The jukebox was playing fairly unobtrusive and pleasant classic punk, and the lighting was a flattering shade of orange, and there was an aging George Foreman Grill behind the bar. I don't remember why it was there; I remember we asked the bartender about it, and he invited us to make panini on it if we wanted to, which was nice. \n\nWhat I do remember is that the bartender has an EPIC moustache; the kind of lush, old-growth moustache which on any other similar tall skinny hipster would make my eyes roll so far back into my head that I would actually be staring right at my atrophied prefrontal cortex. But no, there was no eyerolling here. This was a moustache as fat and proud and sleek as a Persian cat. This was an entitled moustache, one that I could not do anything but respect. Also, dude was cool, he answered all our stupid drunken questions about the George Foreman Grill and the beer/shot special. \n\nI like this place.

I think this would be a good place to start out for the night. Knock back a few cocktails and meet up with your friends. It wasn't crowded at all on a Saturday night which is good for being able to talk to people, but not so good when you've come from 4 other bars. In fact, in that case it's a bit of a downer.\nWhile I usually love a dark hipster-esque bar, I gotta say this experience was more depressing than anything. Maybe it's the fact that the air still has a lingering stale quality from the days where people could smoke inside. \n\nI would give it another shot due to the quality of the staff.", "author": "Nikki M."}

My friend, who I came with and was buying, asked what some of their best bourbons were. The bartender pulled 3 bottles and poured samples for us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-09", "description": "Despite the rave reviews, I was skeptical about a whiskey bar in the Tenderloin, especially when I saw the industrial-looking front door. My expectations were pretty low. But then I walked inside...\n\nI was literally stunned by the wall of scotches and whiskeys. There were easily 50 single-malts and that many again of blends. By looking hard, I could see that they do have a full basic bar spread, but this is most definitely a whiskey den.\n\nThe bartender, Pablo, was friendly and personable. He kept the lighting and music volume low, which was perfect for meeting up with friends and focusing on the virtues of my drink. When describing their Whiskey Special--a shot of the whiskey of the day plus a pint of PBR for $7--he mentioned that they sometimes feature a Japanese whiskey. When I mentioned that I wasn't aware Japan produced whiskey, he looked at me like I had 3 heads! He then quickly recovered, provided a brief lesson on Japanese whiskey and poured me a sip of Yamazaki 12-yr to taste. It was initially ethereal, then finished strong. The 18-yr was even stronger.\n\nOverall, a cool, laid-back, unpretentious place with solid pours and very reasonable prices. Whiskey Thieves seems like a good place to introduce a friend to scotch.\n\nTRIVIA: Japan is the 2nd largest producer of scotch in the world and has been rapidly gaining international fame and acceptance; in 2008 Japanese distilleries won both Best Single-Malt and Best Blended recognition at the World Whiskey Awards.", "author": "Bill B."}

Whiskey thieves you stole my sobriety and now I'm paying for it. \n\nSo just this month, I moved to a moderately shady neighborhood a block away from a whisk(e)y bar! This place rules!!

You know...the non-cheech and chong kind.  I have very sensitive eyes and they get all teary with very little irritation.  I also don't like the smell that lingers on your clothes when you are around smoking.  Worst of all I hate having to clean out black snots from my nose after being in a place all night with smokers.\n\nThat being said, I was easily able to tolerate the smoking at Whiskey Thieves last friday when I came here with *real* friends to meet up with *yelp* friends.  Worlds collided!\n\nIt was all good though.  My yelp friends treated my real world friends very well and good times were had by all.  Although this is another one of SF's signature narrow-long bars the area in the back with the sofa along the walls provided some relief.  We parked ourselves back there and the liquor, conversation, and laughing flowed all the way until closing time.  Seriously, they had to kick me out while I was mid-pee in the women's rest room.  But they did it nicely.\n\nIf you have smoking friends or you are a smoker yourself then add this to the short list of bars that you can freely indulge in your vice in without having to walk outside and consort with some of SF's finest homeless peeps or tranny hookers.", "author": "Luis M."}

My friends and I were intrigued by the name (we are scotch enthusiasts) as well as the chalkboard advertising a PBR and shot of whiskey for $7. We didn't go in on the Friday when we walked by and searched some reviews yesterday afternoon and hit it up because we needed to see this place from the inside especially after a lot of good reviews and claims that they had upwards of 300 whiskies\n\nIt certainly is a dive bar but I wasn't worried about getting shanked so that's pretty cool. The bartender was rough around the edges (won't get into details about what she said, it was funny but out of bounds for a bartender to say). The whiskey selection is great and I find of like the various levels of shelving. As for the amount of bottles on hand, I need to call shenanigans on that. I would guess there 's maybe 75 or so, unless there's a ton of them hiding somewhere else. The first photo on this site isn't a fair representation of the selection as it looks very organized with multiple bottlings from distillers whereas it seemed like 1 bottle per from what my eyes could see. I picked out an Old Pulteney 21 year old and my buddy got a Laphroaig Cairdeas we paid $14 and $15 respectively. Being from Toronto and the pours we got that's a fair price, especially the Pulteney.\n\nThe music/jukebox cranked out some pretty good tunes, my girlfriend and buddy were loving it. I'm kind of indifferent myself. This spot is full of character (the artwork on the walls is a trip) and characters and that's a good thing. Perhaps at the beginning of review I came off a little tight but I'm just calling it like it is. In the grand scheme of things this is a really solid place to go if you like whiskey. If you want to sit, relax and really enjoy a dram then maybe not so much (perhaps during the day). This is one of the better whiskey bars I have been to and with the interesting decor, music, etc it is a nice change. I would definitely recommend.", "author": "Timothy J."}

Bourbon, Scotch, Jameson's....love it! \n\nSo I figured, why not try a place that has whiskey in the name...so I went here the other day after work with my boss, and my buddy...It was around 5:30, so the place was pretty empty, and Matt the Bartender (nice name!) was nice enough to give me a few tastes of some whiskeys I'd never even heard of...plus they had Newcastle on tap which always a bonus for me, you know, helps wash down the whiskey and all. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. \n\nHad that been my only experience here, I would have given it at least 4 stars, because it is a nice little bar...however, the smoking really got to me.  When I went in the afternoon, I noticed the ashtrays out, and a couple of people smoking, hmmmm, I thought, isn't that illegal these days? I'm no anti-smoking Nazi or anything, but I don't smoke and it smells. But I was drinking whiskey, so I didn't really mind...\n\nFast forward to later that same night...I was meeting a friend who lives in the TL about a block from here...and she mentioned how she had never been here, and based on my pleasurable experience earlier in the day, I said I was all for it...however it was much more packed now, and the smoke was unbearable. Although we stayed for a while anyway to have some whiskey and beers...by the time I got home later everything I was wearing stunk of cigarettes. \nGross.", "author": "Matthew S."}

Thieves is certainly one of those dives that is purposefully a dive, unlike say the Nite Cap, which is a real 'what-the-fuck,'- dive, but it does it well like the Elbo Room, The Kilowatt and the Page (well, the Page borders on an unintentional dive, but that's another argument,) But I tend to use Whiskey Thieves as a happy hour starting point.\n\nIt's always funny how it seems to be a bar full of people drinking alone.

Why have I neglected you, you beautiful little gem of hip whiskey lover's delicious? Actually, I know exactly why, but this is a Yelp review and, as much as I adore my Yelp friends, the reason I've previously avoided Whiskey Thieves is, in the immortal words of Salt-N-Pepa, none of yo' biznezz. Thankfully, I got over my avoidance issue and took BART to Civic Center the other night, from whence I trudged up to Geary and into the welcoming arms of my new beau, Whiskey Thieves. Ahhhhh. \n\nExisting on the same block of Geary as the always poppin' and very chill Caffeine and the ever-popular Cairo Nights, Whiskey Thieves offers myriad opportunities. You can get drunk and then order from the Domino's across the street! You can get trashed on whiskey and then smoke yourself sick on flavored tobacco at Cairo. Shit, this is the TL, so you can get drunk, smoke a blunt out front and then spend the rest of the evening barfing into the gutter, if you really want. The establishment is delightfully underlit, with a stainless bar that resonates charmingly when you (are really drunk and) knock on it. You can leave knuckle marks if you're forceful enough, but I'm a lover, not a fighter, so this is not part of my repertoire. Behind the bar, the wall is covered with more bottles of whiskey than I have ever seen in one establishment. On the left side of the bar are Irish and Scotch whiskeys, and the right houses North American whiskeys, including a delightful variety of bourbon (mah whiskey o' choice), from the inexpensive to ridiculously (to my mind) expensive shots that my peasant's palate is not refined enough for.\n\nMy friends and I came on Thursday, during happy hour, when you can get a shot of ANY whiskey and receive a can of beer for a dollar. Not bad, eh? My friend ordered a shot of Scotch that was about $8...and a PBR, which may not be the most appropriate accompaniment, but for $1? Fucks yes. Keep em coming, barkeep. I ordered a Jack Daniels Single Barrel and a Tecate. Again, not a bad deal for a buck. There was also a crowd of people indulging in whiskey tasting--this is, perhaps, the free whiskey tasting which I've heard spoken of. But we weren't sure if it was free or not, so we didn't inquire. And potentially missed out. But it's a-okay, because after happy hour ended, a generous shot of Bushmills and a PBR only set you back $5. \n\nOn top of the outrageously good prices and excessive (in a good way) whiskey selection, the bartenders were ceaselessly friendly and helpful--and more than willing to offer up samples, even of the more expensive selections. When I saw a man taking samples of 3 different bourbons, the least expensive of which was either $12 or $15 a shot, I drunkenly told the bartender that she could give me samples too. And you know what? She did--without hesitation.\n\nAnd this is how I learned that I prefer Makers Mark and Knob Creek to very expensive bottles of bourbon. \n\nOverall, though I know that I won't be coming here very often (wish I could), Whiskey Thieves is probably the coolest new-to-me bar I've been to in a while. There are benches and cool pleather cubes to sit on, a few low tables, extra seating and a pool table in the back, and really friendly staff AND customers, who were more than willing to shoot the shit, let me bum smokes, borrow their lighters, wear their hats, etc. And they have punk rock on the jukebox. \n\nSold. 150% sold.", "author": "Ashley M."}

It was dark. It was noisy. I liked it the second I walked in. A group of rowdy locals sat at the bar, drinking like it was their last day before setting off on a long journey without alcohol. Most of them availed of the 'Whiskey special' which consisted of a can of PBR and the whiskey of the week for the meagre sum of $ 7,-. I took a seat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly guy with a shaved head and a long beard. He looked like Kerry King from Slayer but then 20 years younger. He introduced himself as Steve and served me a pint with a smile on his face. As I drank my pint, I got talking to a couple of locals, an Asian guy of my age and his 12 years younger girlfriend called Meredith. She worked at the local aquarium and told me about her school, her job and what she did in general. Bartender Steve had by now advised me to try his favorite bourbon, a brew called Rock Hill Bourbon. I took him up on his suggestion and was amazed by the depth of the flavor. I was always convinced that bourbon was cheap knock off whiskey that tasted of vanilla. Perhaps I should add that my general knowledge of bourbon is mainly based on big name, small taste brands like Jim Beam, but still. This was a revelation, a bourbon that was up there with the best of the Scottish single malts and well worth the $7,- I paid for it.  I hung around with the locals, drank bourbon and beer and felt like I had been a regular for years.  After some time, Steve announced that his shift was over, which basically meant that he kept drinking behind the bar, but now didn't have to serve us anymore. \n\nHis place as provider of drink was taken by a pretty girl with dark hair and bright eyes. \n\nI introduced myself as Lennard. \n\nShe introduced herself as Simone. \n\nI was stunned by this coincidence. As most of you will know, one of my best friends is called Simone and I met her in a dark and noisy bar, not unlike this one. Now here I was, 11 hours on a plane and about 9000 kilometers from home and the first bar I sit down in for longer than 20 minutes has a bartender named Simone.  I told her about this incredible coincidence and we got talking. We got on great. She even offered me a free toasted sandwich on the house, a Sunday evening treat normally reserved for the regulars. I loved this place and I already liked San Francisco a lot.  By that point, I had already decided that this would be my local for my stay in the city and I would be back a couple of times. One more thing about this great bar that I would like to say is that it was here that I had my first ever can of PBR. For those of you that don't know this beer, it is generally regarded as a beer for highschool kids and students who want to get drunk cheap. Most pubs sell it for $2,- per can and at liquor stores you can usually buy a 12pack for something like $ 7,-. I was given a can by Simone, who could not believe that I had never drank it before. \n\nThis beer, I must say, has NO taste whatsoever. Some beers have little taste, or taste sour, sweet or bitter. This stuff has no taste at all. It literally is like drinking water with alcohol in it. \n\nAfter some more drinks, I stumbled back to my hostel, tired of getting up very early, the long flight and the 8 hour time difference. It was around midnight, which meant that back home in Dublin it was 8 in the morning. I walked up to my first floor hotel room and had one of the best nights sleep in a year. I already liked San Francisco and I had hardly been more than 2 streets away from my hotel. I fell asleep wondering what the rest of the city had to offer.", "author": "Lennard L."}

Back then, the Tenderloin was, well, the Tenderloin, and I couldn't walk down the street without being hollered at by homeless drunks or propositioned by yuppies slumming their way down Hooker Highway Hyde Street for a dose of Asian tranny booty and a few bumps in a piss and fish smelling alleyway. But I digress. \nWe shambled into Whiskey Thieves last weekend for a few pops before a show at the Hemlock. I don't know squat about whiskey, except that the last time I drank it, I ended up puking with my mom. Nuff said. \nThe friendly bartender noticed my duh-face when I stepped up to the bar and quickly suggested the special - a shot of whiskey and a beer for 8 bucks. He recommended the Rock Hill Farms (I only remember this 'cause I actually wrote it down). It was smokey and sweet and smooth. Folks here seemed friendly and relaxed. The bartender actually checked in with us later to see how we liked his suggestion. We felt welcomed and relaxed. \nThree rounds later, I treated my friends to rambling reminiscences about inviting strangers to spend the night when they were left homeless during the 'quake; the time I saw Jerry Garcia in a divey steakhouse on Larkin, obviously hankering a snack after seeing a man about some horse;  and the time I naively walked home by myself from Das Klub by taking a short cut up 6th street at 3 am.

Another plus is that they carry anchor steam's small batch rye and single malt...didn't get around to those on this trip, but I am already planning my order for next time, which will have to be a wednesday so as to take advantage of weenie wednesday when hot dogs are free during happy hour!!", "author": "L W."}

Cleaner than a divebar, unfortunately this place seems to also lack the character of a good dive bar.  As a neighborhood bar, it seems to also fall a bit short, still being a bit too upscale for its location.... which is undoubtedly the Tenderloin.\n\nOur bartender was cordial enough, and Whiskey Thieves does have a better-than-average selection of Whiskeys, including locally distilled Old Potrero, made by Anchor Brewing.  \n\nI think we ordered gin and tonics that day, and I remember them being not particularly cheap, but a bit on the watery side.  \n\nBut my biggest beef is with the imposing bar counter.  The counter is very high and uninviting.  There is a huge pillar that cuts the bar in half and the bar itself so dominates the room that it makes it difficult to look around the room easily.  You feel like your bartender is standing in a hole in front of you.\n\nAll in all, I like the fact that Whiskey Thieves is there, but it doesn't do anything that Aces up the street does better.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-25", "description": "This bar has changed since they eliminated indoor smoking, and so far not for the better. The crowds seem sparser and the atmosphere, now clear of lingering smoke from two-dozen cigarettes, appears far more inviting. If this was ever a dive bar (really, it is more of a 'neighborhood bar')  that divey feeling evaporated with the exhales of the last 2am smokers. \n\nFortunately, there are a dozen reasons to keep coming back, even for us smokers. The staff is top notch, both personally and professionally, and the whiskey selection is borderline incomparable. The juke box is one of those new-fangled internet machines, but the default selections gear towards alternative and metal. There is a pool table, though on busy nights it is surrounded by high-skill players, which may intimidate some. Local art is always on display. Drinks are cheap and even cheaper during their extended happy hour. \n\nThe whiskey selection is truly fantastic and the bartenders will be happy to chat about it and offer samples when they aren't busy. Great beer selection for the beer drinkers. Wednesday night they offer up free hot dogs with some basic fixins to accompany your cheap happy hour drinks. Despite the clear air and clean presentation, the bar is kept fairly dark, which is the only reason I can see for some people to label this place a 'dive\". \n\nIf you're looking to 'slum it up' and take an 'adventure' to a 'dive bar', don't come here - you will be disappointed. Try the Outsider across the street.  If you are a big Whiskey fan and/or you live in the neighborhood and you've never been to Thieves, repent now and get your ass on a bar stool.", "author": "Phil D."}

Actually, i have a feeling that i might end up going to the Tenderloin a lot this year since it's a neighborhood i really haven't explored at all. yeah, it's one of the most sketchy, filthy, and uninviting areas in SF and lots of people avoid it like the plague, but I get the feeling that there are really some cool hidden spots over there that don't get the credit they deserve just because of their location.\r\n\r\nin front of the bar, they had their logo shimmering and lit up through galvanized steel, which was a pretty cool effect and kind of had a techno-pirate kind of feel to it. inside, there was more galvanized steel along the wall and the place actually looked a bit fancy to be just another dive bar. as the name implies, this place is all about whiskey and they actually have a four page whiskey menu with a ton of different kinds. unfortunately, i couldn't tell a $50 whiskey shot from a hole in the ground, and the only whiskeys i recognized on the menu were Jack Daniels and his other cheap-ass friends. I've drank my fair share of Jack, so i decided to try his cheapo friend called George Dickel, which ended up being pretty good. Other than whiskey, this place had a bunch of beers on tap including Chimay, and also sold my favorite beer, Hoegaarden, which you can't find in a lot of places. Actually, just the fact that this place has Hoegaarden makes it good in my book, now if they could only get it on tap...\r\n\r\nLike i said, it was only 6pm, and the bar had just opened for the night, so it was pretty dead. there were probably only like 5 other people in the place, so the three of us just sat around at a table and drank. the place had a pool table which we didnt try, and apparently Tom's favorite pinball game ever, which we didnt get to try either since it was mysteriously unplugged soon after we arrived. they also had one of those tech jukeboxes that downloads songs off the internet, so we ordered a few songs, although it was kind of a rip off at $1.00 per song. our songs didnt play till about a billion songs later, which is weird cause i never saw anyone put a ton of money into the jukebox. i read later that Whiskey Thieves is one of the few bars in SF where you are allowed to smoke, but we weren't sure of this at the time since there were some no smoking signs posted.\r\n\r\nAnyways, overall i thought this place was really cool. the drinks were decently strong, selection of beer was good, and it seems like it'd be a fun place to hang out later in the night when there are more people. hopefully I'll go back there some day and check it out again...\r\n\r\n(my resolution this year is to visit 50 new bars in SF.  read about it at: http://fiftybars.thisisvlad.com)", "author": "vlad k."}

You know: \"You wanna GO....  where everybody knows your naaaammmmmeeee.... \"  yeah, kinda like that.  you recognize most of the peeps because they live around the corner and come here continually and you play pool with the same circle of friends that frequent the place.  but, well, other than that.  no reason to come here.  a bit of a divey bar. no frills unless you consider a pool table and an arcade game 'frills.'  Although I will bump it up from 3 to 4 stars purely based on the fact that I could play frogger between beers.  FROGGER!  oh yeah.  and Galaga too.  SCORE.  As long as you don't expect too much and you don't expect the place too renovated or new or clean, and all you expect is a place to hang with a minium of fights and good bartender service with reasonable prices, then this is a good spot.  Expect to meet a lot of people that \"live around the corner\" as I think few make the drive to come here.", "author": "dan h."}

I don't have the cure for either of these pathetic state of affairs but I do have the perfect coping mechanism and that is Whiskey Thieves. San Francisco has too many goddamn \"dive\" bars and half of them aren't proper dives to speak of. Let's get one thing straight, a dive isn't merely a place that looks drab, has a jukebox and pool table if it's filled with a bunch of poorly dressed bar-goers with a penchant for working class staples like PBR and flannel. That's just dressing the part and it's tantamount to the post-college, young professional crowd doing their part to blend in at Matrix. And while both demographics would be quick to confront the other with disdain, I would argue that we consider both to be branches of the same tree. So if you agree, let's like, cut the cliched verbal assault against said tree and head over to Whiskey Thieves where basically you're not going to run into a bunch of the same morons you caught making out last week. Not that the types of people lurking here aren't disposed to some affection but that's the point: you go to a bar to drink. There's something to be said about the therapeutic effects of getting completely obliterated among those that share a similar plight. Plus, if you get wasted and act the fool, well, no one knows you or gives a shit. Ever since I've been of legal drinking age, the incentive for bar-hopping has been in pursuit of the perfect bar that I've romanticized in my head for years--a notion passed down by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and all those drinkers with a writing problem. Well, I haven't yet managed to adequately capture it descriptively but it would at least come down to a kind of sanctuary with an almost transient and ephemeral vibe. Because ultimately, isn't that what we would hope the problems that drive us to drink fundamentally are?", "author": "Jenn W."}

This is just one of those bars where everything comes together to make for a really great place to hang out.  When you walk in you'll notice right off that quite a few people are smoking.  While I'm not a smoker, it's nice to know there are a few bastions of freedom left in this city, and to be honest some bars just don't feel quite right without being filled with smoke.  The wall behind the bar is filled with an insane selection of whiskey, bourbon, and scotch.  What makes this selection even more impressive is the fact that this place is really laid back, bordering on almost being a dive.  Usually such an impressive selection would come with a rather uptight and shiny atmosphere .  Instead this place is filled with seemingly normal people, contained neither annoying hipsters or marina chodes, and the bar staff were genially nice people that really seemed to know their stuff.  In the back is a pool table, a few tables with booth seating lining the walls, and one of those damned internet jukeboxes (see my rant about these abominations in my review for The Page).  I've been in bars all over this city, but this is probably in my top 3 now.  This would be a great bar even if it weren't for the great whiskey selection, but with that added in it's easily one of the best places to have a drink in town and worthy of my 100th review.", "author": "Joshua W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-25", "description": "Excellent for whiskey drinkers- Enormous selection (I tried Bullet) and rock bottom prices. Some friends took advantage of the $7 beer + shot deal that they had. They do have other liquor as well, but if you're heading to a bar called \"Whiskey Thieves,\" you should be ready to drink whiskey.  Bartender was friendly and prompt. Pool table is always a great addition, but it's in a tight spot, so people sitting at tabled nearby should watch out for pool cues. On the smoking thing:   I would never recommend this place to someone who isn't either a smoker or very tolerant of smoke. I was all of about 15 when the smoking ban was passed, so I've not experienced this before. While it was a treat for me- especially on a cold and rainy SF night- I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea. But the deal is that there is clearly a market for this in the City, and applaud Whiskey Thieves for doing it legally (some bars do not) and unapologeticly.", "author": "Jenni D."}

It was great--tasted a ton of different whiskeys and ordered a few at very reasonable prices.

Plus, it was hiding right under our noses, just 1/2 a block from one of my favorite restaurants, A La Turca. She told me WT has a special air system to deal with the smoke. Didn't really feel that in action, if that big air duct on the ceiling actually works, but it didn't get too smokey while we were there. (Note: I don't care for whiskey much, although it's impressively arranged at WT by country of origin, etc.) What I like about this spot: the bartenders were really friendly and approachable; the atmosphere is laid back, and made for conversing with friends. The music was a great alt-mix, but more importantly, the sound level wasn't blasting. We usually hang at the Hemlock, but the loud n'sloppy drunken antics of the barely-proveable 21+ kids there tend to mar the energy/experience lately. WT is more civilized and neighborhood-ey, so we'll be back, for sure.", "author": "Matty G."}

I've spent many a night nursing a drink (or two, or three) with my friends over a game of pool. Yes, I do realize it's in the smack dab in the center of crack-town but then again, it's on the cusp of Van Ness and therefore, offers a quick escape route. But in any regard, it introduced me to Death and Taxes, now a close ranging first compared to all the other deep dark beers. They have a large range of scotch and whiskey (for obvious reasons) and it has been said, if you ask, they will offer you up a taste of each. The bartenders are pretty damn sociable and once they get to know you, welcoming as well. They put their foot down to outrageous action (I should know, believe me) and keep the atmosphere pleasant and cheery, regardless of their dive bar status. It is damn smoky in there but after a while, it becomes second nature, although the next day can leave your clothes smelling rank. Haven't been around as much as I would like lately, as my friends are attempting to quit smoking and the place almost calls for it. But will be back, sooner rather than later.", "author": "Lydia H."}

This place is really cool and the bartenders have always been friendly and helpful. The hot young red head woman is really nice and helpful and fun to deal with but her bearded/ball cap wearing male coworker is a dick. I was sitting at the bar with a friend. We'd had maybe three drinks each and some beers. My money--a stack of maybe 12 one dollar bills---was sitting very much near our (the customer's) side of the bar, no where near the bartender's side of things. The money would have looked to anyone, especially an experienced bartender, as the stack from which my friend and I were amassing our change and paying for our drinks. I watched dick-head bearded bartender dude slowly scoop up our money and begin to place it in his tip jar and I say \"Uh...that would be mine\" so he then plops the stack back down on the bar and with an attitude (note: no apology) says \"well then don't leave it on the bar like it's a tip.\" I told the dude that when I did tip him there'd be no ambiguity and that the cash would be placed near his edge of the bar. For sure, he knew better. He knew he was trying to steal our money. There was no mistaking it. Plus his asshole reaction confirmed it. He was pissed that we caught him out on the attempt. He truly puts the \"Thief\" in Whiskey Thieves. For the rest of time we were in there, whenever he had to dispose of an empty beer bottle in the trash bin located near where we were sitting, this douche bag bartender made a point of loudly hurling the bottle with a dramatic smash into the bin. I guess a dishonest person doesn't like to be exposed for what he is. Not sure if I will be going back in this place again. Too bad, it WAS a cool bar. P.S. we didnt tip the thief.", "author": "Matt G."}
