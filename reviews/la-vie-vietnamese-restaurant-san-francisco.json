I've had many an awesome dinner party at this place and their crab was absolutely amazing! How the mighty have fallen!\n\nSo, basically, very little about our food experience stood out considering they still charge higher-end prices for what you can get for far cheaper and at least as good at many other places. Weordered for dishes, relatively standard Vietnamese fair, and nothing was particularly amazing. On the contrary, the servings were small and the food was underwhelming. For instance, we got green beans with pickles and fried tofu it felt like it had been smothered and soy sauce. No subtlety whatsoever. \n\nGranted, it wasn't bad. The food was clean and if I had paid a third less for it, I would've been satisfied. But with those prices, it feels like they're inviting a deeper level of discernment that they don't I'm merging all that glowingly from. \n\nEither they have a consistent following that is keeping them afloat or the Vietnamese mob is using the place as a front to launder their money. Regardless, cheers to their longevity. Unless they upgrade something soon, I fear they'll just be another great place in SF that only loves on in memory.", "author": "Mario T."}

Needless to say, I'm obsessed! \n\nThe Banh Xeo is absolutely amazing. This is the dish that brings me back every single time. The crepe is made better than any other place I've tried in California. Super duper crispy! Even when it gets cold. I ordered two to share last time. \n\nThe Shrimp Cupcake is also amazing. The waiter recommended it and raved about how much I'd like it if I liked the Banh Xeo so much. He was right! Really similar in the how they add a variety of fresh side ingredient and the cupcake is so cute! It's made with mung bean I believe and the shrimp flavor is just delicious. Apparently it takes a lot of work to make this dish so the chef only takes the order if it's not too busy. \n\nThe Flaming Beef is awesome. It literally is flaming! And you get to watch it on fire for quite a few minutes. It's cooked with a mix of tomatoes and onions that are sooo flavorful. Comes with really good quality rice paper too. And they have the rice paper prepared and separated on these special plates to keep it moist. \n\nThe salads are all solid. They kind of all taste the same, but I don't mind. I've had the Shrimp Salad and the Lotus Root Salad. Both taste really refreshing. They add this fried crispy noodle thing on top for a nice crunch that also looks super cute. \n\nQuail was also yummy and flavorful. It was a special and came with 2 quails. Not something I would order again though. \n\nGarlic Noodles are the only mediocre entree I've had here. Really simple boxed spaghetti noodles in a forgettable creamy garlic sauce. I'm sure it'd taste better eaten with the crab though. \n\nBut overall, the star of the show is the waiter! He runs the whole place and is a hoot. Loves telling stories about his soon to be doctor daughter and how he spoils her. He also makes great food recommendations!\n\nNext time, I'm gonna save up for the famous crab!

It's not just because Hanson is the coolest waiter around who happens to be a bigger sports nut than me, but the food speaks for itself and it's been consistent since my first bowl of piping hot Pho last year.\n\nLa Vie means Life in French, and I will go out on a limb and say their food is life-giving indeed.\n\nMenu says vegetarian, but it's completely 100% VEGAN!!\n\nHanson told me they pride themselves on their vegetarian menu. They do not use eggs, fish sauce or dairy in their veg dishes. They just haven't gotten around to calling it vegan.\n\nThe only thing that is not on the vegetarian menu is the quintessential food of Vietnam, Pho. I asked Hanson how do you make this dish...he laughed and rolled his eyes. In his head he was probably saying, \" I know it's good, but I'd be damned before I give you my secret!\"\n\nWhat to order:\n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu, but some of the favorites that I come back to time and time again are the following:\n\nVegetarian Pho (It's vegan) - The broth is so flavorful that the ubiquitous condiments of hoisin and hot sauce were not needed to enhance the flavor. My taste buds were already going crazy with this life-giving vegetable broth. A few sprigs of basil, bean sprouts and a squeeze of lemon was all that was needed to take this Pho to great to the greatest!\n\nVegetarian Imperial Roll - These are made with rice paper and deep-fried and are pictured on your right. Every one has a different way of eating them, but follow suit and you will not be sorry. I take a lettuce leaf and tear it in half. Then I place a few cucumbers, a few carrots, rice noodle with peanuts, and put one imperial roll on the lettuce leaf. I then top off the Vietnamese style gluten-free wrap with mint, cilantro and their house made chili soy sauce. Roll it up like a wrap and enjoy!\n\nCoconut Curry Eggplant -  The coconut curry was delicious and decadent. A side of steamed rice was perfect to cut the richness a tad. The eggplant was soft and delicate and simply melted as I took a bite.\n\nIt was hard to describe the party that was going on in my mouth at the time. Needles to say I was in vegan food heaven.\n\nGreen Bean with Radish - These aren't your grandmothers green beans. They are infused with soy and garlic and cooked to perfection because they have that beautiful crisp that I am fond of with the green bean yet retained so much flavor without compromising the integrity of the vegetable. \n\nThese are some initial recommendations, but you can't go wrong with anything on the vegetarian menu (which is actually vegan menu).\n\nWell there you have it. Another San Francisco restaurant with great options for the meatless folks.\n\nCheers to good eats,\n\nAnand", "author": "Anand S."}

Those now-mass-produced bottles do not deck the tables here. \n\nJazz playing over the sound system is a refreshing change from the pop noise that pollutes the 1000-4000kHz sound range in many other Asian restaurants. \n\nWe were there for a quiet Saturday lunch. The lights were dim, not over-bright, but enough to see the food with the natural light coming from the south-facing window. The lighting made the place look closed from outside. Glad to find the door open. We sat by the window and people-watched through the huge single pane of sadly-scratchittied glass. \n\nThe spring rolls were atypical. No peanut sauce. But delicious. The pho was well-seasoned, and helped my MCS cough subside. Best pho yet, imo. The calamari is a must-order with fresh peppers, bell and hot, and smattering of other greens including cabbage accompanied by a fresh, spicy no-preservative dipping sauce.  We saved the leftover sauce for the rest of our meal. \n\nThen there are the details like carrot slivers in the soy dipping sauce and thin sliced green onions in the beef pho side serving. Nice touches make a difference. \n\nHow did I miss this place in a year of living in Outer Richmond? It didn't matter that there was only one other occupied table.

La Vie gets a 10 out of 10. \n\nWhile looking for Pho last night (a San Francisco clich\u00e9?) I stopped into a Vietnamese restaurant only to find chicken and pork Pho, which I don't eat. Refusing to be discouraged I tried the next spot on Geary, called La Vie, and I was immediately impressed by how clean, pleasant, and quiet it was- With soft lighting, and an aesthetic set up. \n\nI asked the hostess/server if they had vegetarian Pho. She said yes, and to my surprise she offered a secret menu with vegan Pho, if that was of interest! I became excited! I ordered takeout for myself and my boyfriend who was sick. \n\nWhile waiting, curious about this new place I'd found, I looked over at what others in the restaurant were eating. I noticed that everything appeared to be exceptionally fresh and high quality in this quiet and beautifully lit Vietnamese restaurant. Then and there I decided I wanted to return to try something new. I had a good feeling about this place. \n\nThirty minutes later I sat in my boyfriend's living room eating my vegan Pho. I can say without reservation, it was the best Pho I've had in San Francisco. The vegetables had flavor, the noodles were soft and fresh, and the vegetable broth and tofu were delicious- And I can't wait to go back again to try something else. Additionally, I need to communicate how helpful, kind, and patient the hostess/server was. Her presence added to the good vibes of the restaurant.\n\nLa Vie, thanks for the Pho!", "author": "Anastasia B."}

It is a family-run restaurant, and they always recognize us and ask how we have been doing.  The main waiter there is funny, he does 'magic tricks' for us that crack us up.  \nTheir specialty - the La Vie Roast Crab - is SO DELICIOUS!!  They bring the crab out but take off the main shell once served and underneath is the most delicious crab mixed with garlic and I don't know what, but the crab legs are soo good too - it's not just ordinary crab, but its so flavorful.  We always order two for a family of 5 and it also comes with a side of the garlic noodles.  They bring out lemon bowls afterwards because it can get messy.  We always get the La Vie Combo (which you make your own rolls with grilled prawns, beef, rice noodle, a crispy spring roll, pickled carrots/daikon and rice paper), Sizzling Rice Soup, Beef Look Luck, Seafood Crispy Egg Nest, Crisp Salt and Pepper Wings (the most delicious, crispy wings topped with a jalapeno/red pepper and a spicy fish sauce on the side), House Fried Rice (this isn't greasy or heavy like Chinese fried rice can be, it is light and really good)  We always get Vietnamese drip coffee (individually drips into your coffee cup - DON'T stir it! You have to be patient for this...it has condensed milk on the bottom and the coffee is very strong).  The waitress knows my family, and we always order the Mango Panna Cotta - she tells us to call beforehand to make sure there are enough or else she would make them for us!  The Fried Banana and Ice Cream is pretty good too\n\nLa Vie will always be the restaurant we go to for special occasions - the food is so delicious (I haven't tried my pho here, but my parents have and say it is the best pho they have had).  They tell us they travel around and taste different things to try to improve their menu, but the flavors of every dish is spot on - I recently moved to NYC and dream about their food, but I'll be back in a few months and will definitely come back here! :)", "author": "Risa H."}

I will get into that but I don't want you to think that I had this huge meal with a lot of variety. I had pho. It was a cold day so what better that a nice hot bowl of the this fine countries soup offering. \n\nI really liked the pho. the broth was robust in flavor, the noodle to broth distribution good. If this was a quick pho joint the bowl would probably be considered a small but the flavor of this place was above what you may have experienced at the aforementioned locales. The meatballs were ok. The beef was really good- I wanted more and feel it wasn't enough. I'm hoping it was due to better quality meat being used than other places I've been to. Overall a good bowl of pho. \n\nThe place is unite clean and the service by one waitress was spot on for a Tuesday afternoon. I feel if there were a table or two more they would definitely need more waitresses. \n\nPrice was reasonable as I mentioned at other places the bowl would be considered a small but that is ok. \n\nA couple of side notes- one of their menu prices said $1,95 when I asked the waitress she said it was supposed to read $11,95. Big difference which should be fixed. \n\nAlso there is a $2 charge if you use a credit card for purchases under $18. That seems a little exorbitant. I rarely carry cash so I may decide upon another place if I am craving pho. Sad really. \n\nOverall I will come back but hopefully with cash in hand or more of an appetite.", "author": "Angel G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-29", "description": "I was excited to come here since I am in the area a lot.  Vietnamese food is arguably one of my favorite asian cuisines and I have worked in Hong Kong for the last 3 years and traveled to almost every country in Asia at this point.  \n\nIt was one of those crazy work weeks and I came here on a Thursday night, there were about 7 tables of 2 people each that night and I was by myself.  I just wanted something quiet and good.  I sat down and looked at the menu for a while, the curry sounded good which was a combo of chicken and vegetables.  I asked if it came with rice which it did not so I ordered a side of brown rice.\n\nThe place was quiet and relaxing.  My food came out and I took a few bites and just didn't really like it.  I was kind of bummed and figured I would just power through it and leave and not enjoy my downtime.  Then after a total of 5-6 bites after spitting out some of the chicken because of lower quality cuts I decided why should I put myself through this?  It isn't a healthy dish, it isn't good and I want to find a new go to place for vietnamese food.\n\nIt was about $11-$12 which is pretty reasonable but I still wanted to be able to eat it.  I asked her when she walked by if I could get something else because I didn't like it.  I almost never do this, maybe a total of 2-3 times (including this one) in my life but I really couldn't eat it.  It was brown curry that was sweet, thick and reminded a bit of wet dog food or economy plane food on an American carrier.  The vegetables were fine, it was the sauce and the chicken that I really couldn't eat.\n\nAfter I quietly asked to get something else, she said why?  I explained I really didn't like it and would just order something that wasn't chicken and did not have this sauce.  She said well you already ate half of it.  I responded I did not, I had about 5 bites, maybe 6.  2 pieces of chicken, 1 celery sliver, 1 broccoli and maybe 1 other vegetable bite and I just had to put the chicken bits with the tendons on the side of my plate.  She said, that she has never heard of anyone doing such a thing and just doesn't know what to do.  I said go mention it to the chef and let me order something else.  I will keep my rice for the next dish.  She said ok be right back.\n\nShe then proceeded to check on every single table asking if they liked their food.  I noticed 1 other person who ordered to curry who didn't eat much of it.  The server asked how it was and why she didn't finish it and the customer responded \"she was full\".  I unfortunately heard my rude server asking anyone as she did it loud enough so I could hear.  I felt this was quite catty and very unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable.   I overheard her, not by choice, just because she was asking everyone how their food was loud enough so I had to hear, about how their meal was and everyone said it was good.  \n\nSo she came back to me with a lot of attitude and said I just asked everyone in the restaurant how their curry was they liked it so you are wrong.  She said I can't help you since everyone else liked it.  The thing here is I only hear and saw 1 other person eat the curry who didn't finish it.  Maybe it was because she was full or that she prefers to avoid eating dog food, who knows? No one else that I could see had this curry.\n\nAND even if they had, is that really the way to handle this?  Ask everyone else to prove me wrong?\n\nShe came back and said we can't take that off your bill.  She said that I am only doing this because it is an Asian restaurant.  That no one does this in American places and insinuated I was racist.  I said no, actually it has nothing to do with it being Asian, it just isn't good and I would like something else.  She continued to raise her voice at me and said that I can't just expect free food and she doesn't have to do anything about this dish.  I should just pay for it and leave.  For some reason I was still calm and nice and I said but I was looking for a local go to vietnamese place I could eat at.  She said well don't come back.  I said why are you making this such a big deal?  And she said I am directing this here because it is an Asian restaurant.  I finally said ok, well then I am just going to leave then and walked out.\n\nI honestly feel like I have never had a more rude server in my life.  She was pretty awful and I promise, it has nothing to do with the place being Asia, I love Asian food.  She was very immature and unprofessional.  I will obviously never come back since the food wasn't good, the service was terrible and apparently I am not welcome back either.  The whole time I was very quiet, polite and calm.

This is actual time sitting at a table and not waiting to be seated.\n\nIf I could, I would give 0 stars\n\nHere is the rough the timeline:\nSeated immediately - got the menu\n15 minutes from seated to when our order was taken\n20 minutes from order taken to appetizer served\n15 minutes from appetizer served to when main courses were served\n20 minutes eating\n15 minutes from when finished to when someone came to take 1 set of dishes\n10 minutes from when we asked for the bill to when the bill came (had to ask twice)\nLess then 1 minute to come pickup the cash - they were really fast doing this\n\nWhen we there, the staff did not turn over tables or bus tables.  2 other couples came in waited to be acknowledge, but left since no one acknowledged them.  This place needs help in the front of the house to keep things flowing.\n\nThere were 2 people working the front and the place had less then a dozen tables, so there really should not be any reason why the staff could not keep up.  At no time during our dining did anyone come up and ask how were things or if we needed refills or anything at all.\n\nThe menus we received were old, looked like the same ones I saw about 10 years ago (yes - it has been that long since I ate here and I live only 7 blocks away.  Pages were dirty and ripped.  Changes/Additions were glued on to existing pages.\n\nI ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee - when it came, I was happy it was served in the metal French Drip cup...however, when I opened the lid to press down on the press, I noticed the press was missing.  So I could not squeeze the grinds more then what a regular slow drip could do.  At least the coffee was good.  This was the best thing we ordered.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Roll ($6.45) - flavor was decent, the mint added freshness to this dish; it did not need the accompanying dipping sauce.  The problem I had with the dish was the temperature...the outside part of the roll was room temperature and the inside of the roll was cooler.  The wrapper had begun to get hard again from sitting.\n\nFive Spiced Roast Chicken Entree ($8.95) - the chicken was thickly cut and grilled.  Not too sure if the tamarind sauce was the dipping sauce or the chicken was marinated in to, but for a 5 spiced chicken, there was not much flavor.  However the pickled carrot garnish was pretty good.   The dipping sauce that came with the chicken was a combination of sweet chili sauce and I guess tamarind...it was watery and did not stick to the chicken.\n\nLastly we ordered the Tomato and Basil Noodle Soup ($8.95) - there is suppose to be ground shrimp and crab in this dish.  The soup base was lacking complexity you might expect from tomato and basil.  There was a tiny chiffonade of basil that did not add flavor or texture to the soup...it only added a bit of green to a basically red color broth.   Now the dish was suppose to only have shrimp and crab, but some how a mussel appeared in the dish...not sure what other dish shared either the same broth or noodles.\n\n\nAs my frequent followers know, I try to make it a point to review the bathrooms; on Facebook I photograph and collect different Men's room signs...I find variations funny, but this is the first time I felt I could not photograph or post a sign.  I cannot pin down which emotion I had when I first saw the sign...funny, troubled, disturbed or shocked.  \n\nThere were 2 gender neutral restrooms.  The one closet to the front is identified as being handicap accessible.  First of all, I have the say that both my wife and I went to the further one, the non handicapped.  I found that restroom clean and well lit.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The only issue I had about the room was the wall mounted soap dispenser...it was broken, but there was a pump dispenser on the sink.\n\nNow for the signs on the doors: each door contained a sign that depicted a drawing of a male standing up with representation of pee coming out of his groin area.  For the women, there was a drawing of a female (I say crouched, my wife says squatting) with a pee being depicted coming from \"the area\".  \n\nOverall my wife and I would come back to this place again.

The sugarcane/shrimp wraps were DYI which was fun but sadly had much more lettuce than anything else (including herbs - these were just mint and cilantro). The sauce that came with it was delicious although mostly we felt like that the balance would have been better if the wraps had been pre-made. The raw beef salad was probably our favorite and had such potential but just needed a bit more lime and a lot more spice. The claypot catfish was actually the smallest dish of the meal despite being labeled as a entree. The fish was muddy tasting (being catfish) and came with a tasty but way too salty sauce. \n\nOverall the food was decent without anything that stood out. Possibly good enough to be 3.5 stars even. However, the service was pretty awful with only one waiter who ignored us and spent time clearing a group table despite the fact that we had been waiting for 10min already for our check.", "author": "Amy D."}

The food is delicious and beautifully presented. We tried an array of spring rolls, softshell crab, warm and hot noodles, spicy catfish. Hard to say which was my favorite! I loved them all. It is also a good place for groups so you can sample several dishes. Waitstaff were also helpful in choosing menu items. I have never tried the pho or other noodle soups, but might should I return with a smaller group. At a place like this, though, it seems a shame to be ordering soup when you could be enjoying other dishes. Downsides, well, as others have already indicated, service is slow and inattentive. The restaurant wasn't that busy (4 tables of customers?), but there seemed to be only one server. Most in our group were Asian, and there is that stereotype that Asians don't tip, or tip well enough, so our bill came with a 20% already included. I found that off putting and makes me hesitate to return, as much as I love the food. Why should I be required to tip (especially 20%, including tip on the tax) for subpar service? Maybe they won't add tip if I decide to do take out?", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

Not only was the food bland but the service was absolutely awful. \n\nI came here on Sunday night with 2 of my friends and this place was not busy at all - maybe 8 other people dining here. We ordered the fresh shrimp rolls (tiny portion and barely any shrimp), veggie pho (that's what I had and it wasn't anything special), chicken pho and a chicken curry dish (this was the only decent thing that was brought out ((what my friends said - I don't eat meat)). \n\nI'm really not one to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it. The service that we had was so bad that it was funny! Both the older man waiter and the lady seemed as though not only did they hate their jobs but they truly hated us (and we weren't too needy and were very nice). When the lady brought out my friends Vietnamese Coffee and he simply opened it to look inside, she pretty much shoved his hand away from the glass. He's had Vietnamese Coffee before and knew exactly what he was doing! Not once did either of the waiters come to us to ask us how our meal was, but that's not even the best part... I asked for extra Cilantro for my pho (usually, all other places give you sprouts, basil, jalepenos, lemon AND cilantro - this place didn't). When I asked her for it, she told me there is already cilantro in my pho (there was BARELY any in it). I asked her if I can have a little more and it felt as though I was asking her for a star from the moon. When she returned with a plate full of cilantro (I asked for a little), we asked her to bring us some fresh onions. After asking that, she said in a very rude, almost screaming tone, \"ANYTHING else?\" We were in complete shock! We weren't asking for much, just a couple of things!\n\nHere's the kicker... the bill comes and there's an extra $4.00 on the bill. When we asked what this bill was for, the waiter tells us its for the cilantro and onions. I'm sorry, but I have NEVER had any Vietnamese restaurant charge extra for cilantro and onions. Those are items that should come standard with any Pho! When I explained this to the waiter, he didn't care and all and told us we have to pay for it. I just laughed.

My friend and I shared an appetizer which was so delicious that I could have ordered maybe two more to go and enjoyed it as a snack later. Up to this day, I still crave the Pho and Appetizer. \n\nSadly, that is literally the only good thing that I can say about this restaurant. And while I believe most people aim to create dishes as incredible and savory as the ones I had at La Vie, I also strongly believe that the service makes a huge impact in someone's overall experience.  Especially when it comes to dining in at a restaurant that you intend to stay at for longer than 15-20 minutes. \n\nWhen my friend and I got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately because there was only one other group. The waitress took our order within the first 5 mins of us being seated because we pretty much knew what we wanted right away. I ordered a Vietnamese coffee to enjoy with my meal because I wanted to have enough energy to drive back home after (just came from a relaxing spa appt. and had an hour drive back home ahead of me). Our food came relatively quickly, then after that - I'm 100% sure our waitress either forgot about us, or just didn't care. She didn't bother to check in on us any time after bringing out our food. She had no problem entertaining another table for a good half hour.  We waited our entire meal for the coffee until we were finally over it, then waited another 15-20 mins for her so we can get the bill.  My friend had to go up to her and interrupt her conversation with the table to ask for our bill and told her to cancel the coffee that she never got for us.  Her response was, \"Oh, I had it in the back.\" My friend was not impressed and said, \"We ordered it over an hour ago- we didn't order it to wait until our meal was done, which we also finished about 30 minutes ago and you haven't check on us for about 50 minutes now.\" It was ridiculous. She definitely did not get a tip from us.

It was pretty empty around 1:30 in the afternoon and I recall there were maybe two other customers at the time.\n\nThe gentleman who waited on tables that afternoon was constantly smiling and very gracious with his service constantly checking to see if everything was okay.  He brought me a pot of tea and he told me he had just prepared it as I walked in the the door.  I didn't like the tea however, but his preparation of it had nothing to do with that.  I simply didn't like the strong, flowery fragrance in the tea; I thought it was far too perfumy.  It tasted nothing like normal hot tea.\n\nI took a moment to study the large menu.  I ordered the Imperial Roll and the Seafood Crispy Egg Nest (both pictured).  The wait for my food was not too bad.  The Imperial Rolls arrived first nicely plated but showcasing a mound of greens (leaf lettuce, basil & fresh mint) instead of the five measly egg rolls set off to one side.  The rolls were very tasty with finely minced ingredients in the filling.  I noticed the ground pork, some shrimp bits, mushrooms and carrots.  The clear dipping sauce decorated by strings of carrot and bits of red chiles was quite good.  A small portion of pickled carrot shreds and a small mound of rice vermicelli dusted with crushed peanuts also went onto the plating.  I did end up eating most of the greens and thought it went well with the two additional sides.\n\nThe Seafood Crispy Egg Nest took a bit more preparation time, but it arrived piping hot and beautifully plattered.  On a deep fried egg noodle \"nest\" were lots of tender calamari, some medium sized shrimp, whole scallops and a vegetable medley of mushrooms, broccoli, celery, carrots, zucchini and onion in a very light sauce.  It was an excellent dish, and I waddled out of that restaurant enormously stuffed.\n\nThe restaurant has a very clean interior, but some of the menu items are quite pricey.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-12", "description": "While in the Richmond District, and not in the mood for Chinese or Japanese, I found La Vie!  \n\nAt first I was a bit skeptical about what I was getting myself into as their was white table cloth and tea candles set throughout the tables. Furthermore, there was only one other table during prime dinner time.    But I wasn't about to look for another restaurant in the cold, and much of Richmond has been so mediocre for me lately too.   So I gave La Vie a chance. I'm glad I did.   \n\nThe ambiance is simple, just tables and white walls decorated with three Asian instruments on the side walls.  There was also a very elegant Christmas Tree as well--very pretty.  \n\nOur server was a very cheerful and friendly younger Asian gal. She was a great server to have as she offered great recommendations for entrees and for our dessert as well.  I will get to dessert much later.  \n\nFor appetizers, we started off with the Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari.  It came nicely plated with a side of cabbage as well.  The batter for the calamari was a bit thin and minimal, and I would've preferred it to be a bit crunchier.  But the flavor was awesome as it had nice bits of crushed garlic, jalapenos, bell peppers and parsley.  While it was full of flavor, my only complaint about the dish is that there was so much garnish in terms of the jalapenos, parsley, etc, that it made the dish appear larger than it actually was. In turn, there weren't as many calamari pieces given as I would've liked.  http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/OkJ1iRWFNMQepXDC6JyUAg/l\n\nFor entrees, we ordered three dishes.\n\n* La Vie Chicken - http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/1q0cNeZRtyrLDG27fP0iTA/l  Full of flavor, nice and saucy. Dish consisted of coconut milk with curry peanuts basil, cucumber and slices of crispy romaine lettuce.  Everything was equally dispersed and blended very well together; there were also dry chili pieces for that extra kick. \n\n* Green Beans with Radish- http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/JhnlZhp30yEGmQeMKdD9Hg/l  This dish was at the recommendation of our server.  Awesome dish.  Juicy beans lightly cooked in oil, with chopped garlic pieces, and bits of sweet radish as well. I popped these things in my mouth like candy!  \n\n* Garlic Noodles - http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/kjjVV8mo8eYsQGG9H393UQ/l  Unfortunately, not all of the entrees were doing so great.  Garlic noodles were a real disappointment.  My first complaint is that the noodles used are regular spaghetti noodles.  What a bummer! I was expecting them to be some sort of Asian noodles with a bit of a bite to them.   But not the case. Further more, there was not enough garlic flavor, and in stead, there was some Parmesan cheese drizzled on top. This made the noodles a bit dry.  Too bad, because I love love love garlic noodles, but I did not love these.  \n\nDessert!  \n\n* Vanilla Panna Cotta with Mango Puree - http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/y1fv31zLBIi8WXXZl1zdHA/l.  *Licks lip*  Y u m m y !  Our server also made this recommendation to us as well, I'm glad I took it because there were other dessert items that caught my eye...but next time.  As for the Panna Cotta, it was nice and creamy, and had an awesome subtle vanilla taste, not overpoweringly sweet; the mango puree and chopped mango pieces complimented the vanilla very well.  \n\nOur nice server also sent over a complimentary order of a Tiramisu, however, rather than being espresso flavored, it was filled with some sort of Asian fruit, and coconut bits.  I'm unable to describe this dish very well as it wasn't on the menu, and given to us as a comp, but a fruity Tiramisu with coconuts sold me!   \n\nTo sum up, I enjoyed dinner here very much!  The prices are much HIGHER than I normally would've paid for Vietnamese.   I would have like to see a little bit more on the plate in general.  But for the most part all of the dishes made up for the size, in terms of flavor-- With the exception of the Garlic Noodles.  \n\nTotal Bill came out to around $55.00. \n\nI will return.", "author": "Cass J."}

It may not be as traditional as a lot of other places, but the quality is great :) It's a great place to take friends who are visiting to you from out of town or for a quiet and romantic dinner. Really great for dates!! I have had the beef pho, beef pho duo, and the beef luk lac (i think that's how it's spelled? I know it's pronounced \"look luck\") I was never once disappointed by the food and the service is wonderful! \n\nAs for why I didn't rate it 5 stars? It takes awhile to get the food as there are not too many people working at any one time. The service is wonderful, but I think maybe there should be more people to help out. The poor waitress that's there seems to be the only one!\n\nNow some tips: You don't have to do a reservation unless if it is a little later in the evening on a Friday or Saturday, then it fills up. If you want to bring your kids, that's fine, just be ready to constantly tell them to be patient. I have seen a lot of families bring kids and the kids always seem to get antsy while waiting for the food, which tends to stress the parents. Parking is difficult to find!! It is MUCH easier to take the bus or walk. If a car is your option, be sure show up early so you can find a spot. Final tip. Patience, patience, patience.

This place really is pretty fantastic. \n\nI'll preface by admitting that my knowledge of Vietnamese cuisine is fairly limited. My employer and I ordered two items for lunch that I'd never had: the 5-spice chicken, (which I've seen on several Vietnamese menus) and the coconut curry noodles with prawns.\n\nWe indicated that we were on a tight schedule and asked if the items we ordered were appropriate for a quick getaway. The server ensured us that she would make sure we would get out in time for our meeting. I was pleased that they were accommodating and that although the food came out quickly, it was still made well. They brought out the bill at the same time as our food to help speed up the process.\n\nThe combination of flavors was delicious! The cuts of chicken were pretty lean and you could tell by the texture that they used fresh prawns versus frozen.\n\nI would love to come back here for dinner and help them earn their five-star review.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-29", "description": "I found this place through yelp last weekend when the fiancee and I decided to take a lunch break from our walk through GG park. \n\nWhen we sat down, at first I thought maybe I had made a mistake. Yelp doesn't really do a good job of helping you find a good lunch place. The \"$\" places tend to be just coffee and tea and the \"$$\" category can often send you to a place like La Vie, where the white tablecloths and heavy silverware signaled I'd probably be spending a bit more than I planned. We ordered Thai Iced Tea and (a) I didn't like it because it was not as strong as usual and (b) it was $4. So I sent it back even though it felt really awkward because it would have felt even worse to pay $4 for a glass of tea I didn't even like. \n\nI was thinking: maybe we should leave, all I really need is a sandwich. Then the food arrived and I changed my mind absolutely.\n\nI'd expected to like the fried calamari, because, hey, deep fried calamari, how can you go wrong, right? But this was amazingly awesome calamari. First of all, it was fried perfectly. Second of all, it had a tasty salt-and-pepper batter which was both lighter and much tastier than whatever is usually on there. And then thirdly, it was tossed with a bunch of other tasty stuff which (two days later) I no longer remember but included veggies and fried garlic. Also, miraculously, these tossings were dry enough that the calamari did not get soggy as usually happens when you mix in deep fried stuff.\n\nThe \"Lotus Root Salad\" had not looked promising on the menu. It was my fiancee's idea (we were splitting dishes) and she is very enthusiastic about lotus root, a vegetable I consider to be dubious. I don't *hate* it, like I do potatoes, but it's not exactly high up there on the list of choices.  I didn't see any point in trying to make a salad out of it. \n\nAnd they don't, really. What they do is deep-fry a few slices of lotus (which is fabulous) and use them to decorate the sides of the salad. The salad itself is served in a tasty bowl of fried eggroll wrapper and is your basic tasty Vietnamese salad with lettuce and peppers and thin slices of pork, among other things. I really wish they had a menu online somewhere, because I know I'm not doing it justice.\n\nBoth the salad and the calamari were extremely good, several levels above your standard Vietnamese fare. Of course, it's a nicer type of restaurant, so you would be expecting better food anyway. But even considering this, it is outstanding. I didn't give it 5 stars because I reserve that for the truly exceptional places but somebody else might have. \n\nI think the bill was $28 for a salad, an appetizer, one glass of iced tea, and tax. At lunch. So it's kind of a lot. But by that point we no longer minded because the food was so good.\n\nTheir menu needs to be re-written. It neither accurately describes nor gets you excited about what you're about to eat. There's no website or (as far as I can tell) any online menu. This is bad because now I can't remember what I ate or budget for our return for dinner (which, upon leaving we had wanted to do). We can't just go and look in the window bc we don't live there.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it for lunch though, unless you're looking for a fancy lunch. They're more of a dinner place.", "author": "Amy T."}

The first time, we did family style to try more dishes, the second time, family styled it again.\n\n\nWe had a rather large party so we divided the table in half. Folks on my half, the cool half, agreed on having garlic noodles, the spicy coconut crab, curry eggplant, the flaming beef, lemongrass chicken as well as the bo luc lac.\n\n\nThe flaming beef came out first and ou it was on FIYA - literally.  They had a bowl of beef, seasoned and on top of a dish which they set on fire for it to cook.  It was such a show since the place was dim - had everyone and they mama lookin' our way.   After the flames set, the waitress brought the bowl over and you actually get to roll your own spring rolls with the beef! So fun, so yum.\n\n\nThe only downside was that after that first flaming beef dish, it took FOREVER for the next entrees to come and we were HUNGRY. It was about a 30 minute intermission before the next rounds of food appeared. [Good thing we had a big party so all the chitty chatty helped kill some time]  The lemongrass chicken was pretty good since it was loaded with peppers/onions, the whole stinky breath works, but the curry eggplant - howlllaaa. Def. something you need to try. Garlic noodles, also deelish.  Bo luc lac was yummy with its own dipping sauce, don't forget about the dipping sauce!  \n\n\nThe last and most awaited dish finally came, the crab!  They remove the top shell so no guts for all you gut lovers.  We all tried to stay classy but man, there is no clean way to eat a crab so we just dove right in, snapping and cracking away.  Whatever they had UNDER the shell -- bits of noodles and oodles of sauce --  ya'll need to get up in that cause it was bombtastic and tasted a little like heaven. Mm mm mm.   They hooked it up with some coconut ice cream/fried banana/brownie dessert for the birthday folks ... as well as one for the cool half.", "author": "Annie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-18", "description": "Crab? Did somebody say crab??? A few years ago, some friends introduced me to the Vietnamese Roasted Crab experience. After hearing about the famed Thanh Long (offshoots - Crustacean - SF, Beverly Hills, & Las Vegas), friends raved about the experience. Since we can't jump into the Back to the Future experience and taste what it really was twenty or thirty years ago, I need to talk about the now. \n\nVietnamese Roasted Crab = Perfectly pan roasted crab (timing is critical in ensuring that it is not overcooked - meat sticks to the shell - and flavorful. The crab is quartered (duh, I think one crab serves four) and the gao (aka \"crab butter\", brains, that icky orange stuff that sticks to the main shell) is stir fried in an egg, garlic, ground pork (I believe), and some other mystery seasonings into a scrambled mix. This dish comes with a complimentary plate of garlic noodles (think lightly buttered spaghetti noodles mixed with browned garlic and topped with cilantro) - we usually double up on the noodles. The crab is still warm (not, \"I can't hold this without burning my hand\", hot) while the stir fry mix sits centered on the plate. You mix the garlic noodles with the gao mix and just say \"mmmmmm...\" aka nom nom nom. They later give diners individual lemon tea dipping bowls and paper napkins because they know their crab is finger licking good. Depending on the season, the crab prices can range from $40.00 to $50.00, so this is not for the faint hearted. \n\nAppetizers \n\nLa Vie Combo - Three skewers of grilled shrimp (1 skewer - 3 pieces), bbq pork (2 skewers), and four small imperial rolls with romaine lettuce, mint leaves, pickled carrots, cucumber wedges, and fish sauce. It comes with six individual rice crepes to wrap the above in whatever combination you desire. \n\nCrab meat & Corn Soup - Shredded crab meat and corn in a clear chicken broth seasoned with pepper and garnished with green onions. \n\nMain Courses \n\nCitrus Scallops - Stir fried scallops with zucchini, carrots, oranges, and pineapple wedges, garnished with fried rice noodles and cilantro; doesn't compare to the seared scallops from yesterday.. okay though. \n\nEggplant in garlic sauce - Stir fried eggplant slices with red bell peppers and onions. \n\nClay Pot Special Rice - Seasoned rice with Chinese sausage (lop cheung), chicken meat, shrimp, bamboo shoots, onions, and light ginger flavoring; again, doesn't compare to the Chinese clay pot rice dishes where the rice is perfectly browned as it sticks to the seasoned pot. \n\nThe total bill for four people (including three glasses of Thai Iced Tea) came to $147.00 before tip. We were one of the first to arrive at around 6 pm, as parking can be difficult here. There is a metered lot (in effect until 10 pm) about one block away in case you are unlucky. The dining room was about half full when we left. The highlight is obviously the crab. I've heard numerous complaints about the above mentioned SF crab places, but I can't personally say as I've never dined there. One of the owners told me the difference is that La Vie uses larger crabs in the three to four pound range when available. This is a major difference since no one wants to just suck on a bunch of shells. Whenever my dad is in a down mood or craving for something, the first two words from his mouth is usually, \"La Vie\". Gee dad, I didn't know you spoke French.", "author": "Mike C."}

Having worked in restaurants and being a profoundly grateful person, I NEVER walk out of a restaurant. I just walked out of this one. We\nwaited 10 mins and had to get the waiters attention--to have to ask for water. Then, we asked if we could have the Thai ice tea made with coconut milk instead of half-and-half.The waiter told us no, but luckily the woman working there overhead the question and answered yes. The tea, however, tasted as if it had still been made with half-and-half. so, we waited another 10 minutes and no one came to take order. I attempted to get the woman's attention, but she was busy taking 'to-go' orders on the phone, and cleaning off a table. The waiter made eye contact with me, our menus were on the table closed, and walked the opposite direction! I got up and walked out and as my boyfriend was doing the same, the waiter started hassling him to pay for the two teas! The woman apologized for the slow and horrible service (and still took his money!). The restaurant was pretty full; however, not overwhelmingly so. We walked across the street to a dim-sum restaurant and had a great meal with excellent service.\n-------------------------------------------------\nand just to clarify, for all of you in Yelpland, based on the response I received from the woman I presume is the owner: yes, I have had fresh coconut milk extensively, both with and without Thai ice tea. Maybe it was made with coconut milk as we had requested, and not half-and-half ; however, it tasted unlike any Thai ice tea made with coconut milk we have ever had (and not in a good way!)--which is why we did not drink them, other than a few sips through our straws to taste. Upon further talking with my boyfriend, he did inform me that she did not apologize for the ridiculously long wait (what I would consider ignoring, multiple times). As far as her comment that we are thieves- the poor tasting, 90% left in the glasses, Thai ice tea's were paid for with cash before my boyfriend even attempted to walk toward the door to leave.

We enjoyed the garlic noodles, chicken curry, and vegetarian hot and sour soup. \n\nThe garlic noodles are not the green ones you'd find at Osha. They're simply spaghetti noodles flavored with chunks of garlic, fresh cilantro and sprinkled with parmesan. Not what I'd typically order at a vietnamese restaurant but I was feeling a bit ill and wanted something easy on the digestive system. In case you're wondering, I'm happy to report it stayed down- and was really tasty.\n\nThe vegetarian hot and sour soup is not only hearty, with good chunks of veggies and potatos (is a potato a vegetable?), but will also clean out your sinuses. My friend couldn't stop blowing her nose. \n\nThe pot of tea seemed to be bottomless- totally worth the $4.50 for at least 3-4 cups per 3 people.  \n\nTab ran the three of us $42 total. I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here, but highly recommend chowing down if you're in the area!", "author": "Kim K."}

La Vie served my and my group of 11 the best Vietnamese cuisine I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The people at the tables on either side of us also agreed that their meals were absolutely fantastic.  \n\nAppetizers: I highly recommend the Imperial roll lettuce wraps that come with delicious accompaniments that include lettuce, mint, carrots and a yummy sauce.\n\nentrees: I recommend the catfish clay pot with steamed rice, which offered a delicious combination of fish, sweetness and spicy flavors, as well as the garlic noodles, lemongrass noodles and vegetable curry (vegan and vegetarian.)  \n\nWe were a large \"walk-in\" group of 11 people on a Sunday night around 8 P.M., and after some shifting and adjusting of tables and chairs, the restaurant managed to accommodate us, and the servers, although busy with other customers, did a great job taking care of our large group.  The main waiter is a friendly and long-term employee, and I understand that the owner of the restaurant is the head chef.\n\nAfter appetizers, entrees and several bottles of wine, the per person tab with tip included came to $43.  I am definitely returning to La Vie soon, perhaps for a belated birthday party.  I'd love to see a blind tasting of La Vie's cuisine side by side with more expensive places like Slanted Door and Le Colonial.\n\nLa Vie was one of my most enjoyable restaurant experiences in a long time.

Consideration for the plight of those who may follow in my footsteps.

Well eckkkk!!!\n\nHunks of tough chicken, with fat and cartilage still attached, just plopped into the bowl.  And in case you did not get enough grease, the cook plainly deems it unnecessary to skim off the top of the broth the chicken fat that rises----insuring that even if you try to avoid the squishy rubbery fatty chicken in the hope that maybe the broth will be tasty; you are guaranteed  that each spoonful has a minimum 40%  stomach coating (and eventually churning) fat content.

However, here in the land of obesity and a thousand Safeways, we no longer NEED to eat globs of fat to insure our survival through the long hard winter. Cook with the fat to add flavor, yes indeed.

The food is very good, the service is great, and the ambiance is very pleasant.\n\nI am far from being an expert on Vietnamese food and I can't say this is super authentic Vietnamese food (maybe this is more Vietnamese/French fusion than some other Vietnamese restaurants), all I know is that every single thing I've ever ordered from this restaurant was delicious. I am a big fan of seafood, and their seafood dishes are yummy. The food always tastes fresh. Some of my favorites are the imperial rolls, the flaming beef and prawns, any of their fried rice dishes, and the prawns with garlic and black pepper. \n\nIt may be because I was raised in Europe and my bf was raised in South America, but we think the timing of the service is perfect. The staff makes sure to bring your food at the right time, in the right order. In my opinion, there is nothing worse than being rushed while you eat. I prefer not getting my appetizers all at once and not getting my main dish when still working on the appetizers. I also don't like when my food is ready in two minutes, so I like that food at La Vie takes at least five minutes to reach my table.

Worse is that they ripped us off multiple times.\n\nThe waiter who served us quoted us $48/crab when we placed the order.  Then, when we got the cheque, they charged us more.  Then, they disputed with us about how the crab should rightly be charged $53-54, because they quoted us wrong.  A few dollars off of a $300+ tab aren't a lot.  I can't believe they had a big dispute with us, when all we wanted was to get the price we were quoted.  Most businesses take responsibility of their own fault for quoting the wrong price.    \n\nOne more thing, when we ordered the Vietnamese Crepe, I noticed that they gave less lettuce than I normally get when I ordered it at other Vietnamese restaurants.  So, we asked if we can get more.  They brought it to us without telling us that they would charge extra for it.  They gave us 4 more piece of lettuce that looks like mere garnish and charged us $2 for it.  If we knew we're paying $2 for that, we would have not ordered it.  \n\nAlso, when we placed the order, they asked us if we wanted rice.  We said sure.  When the cheque came, they didn't tell us they would charge $1.25 per person for rice when we placed the order.  The menu didn't say so.  There were 9 of us.  Not all of us had rice.  If they told us in advance that it was $1.25 per person, we would have specified how many people wanted rice.  At the end, we paid $12 for 4 bowls of plain white rice.\n\nAlso, CRAPPY SERVICE.  They never refilled our waters without me keeping on asking.  One time, after I asked the water 3 times, the waiter even said, \"You had a water bottle on your table, so I thought you didn't need any water.\"  \n\nThese people are sketchy about what they charge.

We were about to do the same but then our appetizer finally arrived ... over 30 minutes later.  \n\nWe ordered the Grilled Lemongrass Chicken.  The waitress tossed the chicken around in a pan at our table.  I made a comment about how happy I was that the food had arrived but she was looking over her shoulder at the large party the whole time, and then a minute later she put the chicken on our plates and walked away.  \n\nWe rolled the chicken in our crepes and took a bite.  We chewed, we swallowed, and took another bite.  My date said the chicken tasted funny and spit it out.  I held the meat in my mouth while he poked around on the plate.  He made a face and told me to spit it out.  The chicken was uncooked.  We flagged the waitress down and told her the chicken wasn't cooked.  We weren't rude in any way, we expected her to apologize and say she would bring out a new dish ... a cooked one, but instead she said with attitude, \"What do you want me to do about it?\"  \n\nMy date said, \"Bring us another dish, this one isn't cooked.\"  The waitress then said, \"Well it's dark in here, I can't see very well.\"  At this point my date tried not to get upset.  He pointed out that it shouldn't matter whether it was dark or not, that she barely spent anytime cooking it, that we'd been waiting a long time, and that we'd been receiving poor service all evening.  The waitress then started telling us about all the problems in her life and ended with,\"How would you like it if you had to deal with all that?\"  We listened in bewilderment.  Then she continued to tell us that it was her mother's restaurant and she didn't know what she was supposed to do, etc...    \n\nI then asked her what she expects when she goes out to dinner, what type of service, etc.  She didn't answer but just proceeded to be rude and continue on with her problems.  We told her to cancel the rest of our order and bring the check.  She didn't even offer to remove the chicken dish from the bill.  We had to tell her we weren't paying for it.  \n\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER go back there again.\n\nWe went to Khan Toke instead (a fabulous restaurant!!!).  We asked for lemon wedges right away to kill any bacteria in our stomachs from the uncooked chicken.  I was fine but my date had stomach pains all night.

It had a nice romantic ambiance, dimmed lights with a rose on each tables.  Service was nice and attentive considering there was only one server for the whole restaurant.  Be warned because service is a little slow dinner will take around two hours.  When I go out I go for the food and it did not meet my expectations.  Vietnamese food is bursting with spices and flavors but at La Vie the food was unsavory.  One word disappointing. \nWe ordered \n-Imperial rolls, $9.95. The dish came with a side of romaine lettuce, carrots, rice noodles, herbs, watered down fish sauce and 5 mini thumb size rolls.  The rolls were so small that I could barely get a sense of that they tasted like.  \n-Fried calamari, $11.95.  The best dish but the portions were so small.  There were only a handful of calamari accompanied with a side of cabbage and sweet spicy dipping sauce.  The calamari was really crispy on the outside not over cooked inside and it had a nice heat to it.  Did not prefer the dipping sauce, I found that it overpowered the salt and pepper.   \n-I ordered the Basil and tomato noodle soup with crap meat and shrimp, $9.95.  I've had this dish at other Vietnamese restaurants and wanted to see how La Vie's would compare.  The soup base was tomato water, completely bland.  Sparse seafood in the dish.  \n-Coconut chicken with noodles.

So the obvious next plan was to make my mom take me out somewhere I would not normally go. I *really* wanted Vietnamese crab and I know that there is an amazing place in the sunset but I just couldnt remember what it was called! *cries* Driving around, getting hungrier by the second, more and more delirious...i remembered driving past this place while going to shop at One World Market (best russian store in the area fyi). We parked and walked on inside...\nthe decor is pretty simple, it seems like a traditional Vietnamese place....and i was in the a BIG treat and surprise because both the presentation and the flavor of the food was gourmet!! \nWe had...\nfried soft shell crab app = super most delicious not fishy and not overly fried. easily a 5 star dish.  \nshrimp cup cake = THE MOST AMAZING DELICIOUS THING i have ever eaten. seriously..... imagine a cupcake. Now..cut off the top and scoop a little hole out of the bottom part. Insert delicious whole shrimp. Oh yeah, did I mention the cupcake is made out of some sort of a delicious corn coconut type concoction? On the side..there is a vietnamese salad which is basically fresh large pieces of lettuce, a variety of fresh herbs, and a delicious sauce. I have actually been dreaming about this dish every night since I ate it... super 5 star dish. \n\nWe also had the seafood noodle soup which was...I would say a 3.5 star dish. There was nothing actually wrong with it...it just didnt have that special extra oomph that the other dishes had. Also...it probably didnt help that the guy at the table next to us was eating beef pho, which was my favorite dish in the entire world before I gave up red meat...so maybe  I was just...you know....hating myself at the moment. \n\nWe also had the shrimp hot pot which was....i dunno i would also say about a 3.5....but this is a personal flavor thing. I just wasnt digging the spice blend. \n\nMy cousin had the lemongrass chicken which she said was really good...I did not try as...well..I dont eat chicken. \n\nI also give this place major bonus points because they have a vegetarian section of the menu which is actually vegetarian, as opposed to dishes in other places like green beans with pork which can be listed as vegetarian.

From the outside, the place blends in with the other restaurants, nail salons and insurance agencies you will find on Geary Boulevard.  The burgundy awning doesn't exactly scream \"come and eat here,\" but you'd be foolish not to.  \n\nEven the decor isn't much.  It's your basic Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant setup with glass on the tables protecting once white tablecloths.  Add a few traditional gaudy gold/red decorations and a mandatory fish tank, and you've got a pretty good picture of La Vie.\n\nWhat sets this place apart is the food and the service.  The Luc Lac Beef, or 'shaking beef' as it's sometimes called, is unbelievable.  Soft, tender, juicy and tasty, the beef cubes make for a perfect entree.  I also tried their specialty, La Vie Beef, served with coconut milk and curry sauce.  It was delicious, but I am not a curry fan.  I doubt I'd find anything on their menu better than Luc Lac Beef.  The pepper and salt sauce they serve on the side adds a perfect amount of oomph to the beef.  We also had imperial rolls for our appetizer, which were good but not extraordinary.\n\nAnother great attribute of La Vie is the service.  The waiter and the hostess treat you as though you were dining at a 5-star upscale restaurant.  Courteous, helpful and knowledgeable - that describes the waiter at La Vie perfectly.  They refilled our waters repeatedly and replaced our silverware without our asking.  If my memory serves me right, the waiter once told me that he worked at the Ritz Carlton part time.  They wouldn't just hire anyone, you know.\n\nOh, and the prices are very fair.  The dinner with 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, 1 beer, 1 Thai iced tea and 1 soda cost us $110 including tax and tip.  We were very full and very happy with pretty much everything.\n\nAs a big fan of Golden Turtle (that Vietnamese restaurant on Van Ness and Broadway that closed down a couple of years ago), I have to proclaim La Vie my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant.

Not raving about it though is doing this phenomenal place a huge disservice, so...\n\nI absolutely love this place, and I will always choose it over places like Slanted Door.  Wonderful flavors and so true to Vietnamese cuisine.  While they do not serve pho, here you will find other classic dishes that you would not normally see on a Vietnamese menu, like banh xeo, a Vietnamese-style crepe.  The classic shaking bo luc lac (shaking beef) is melt-in-your-mouth-tender and so nicely complimented by the salt-pepper-lime sauce.  The garlic crusted catfish was devoured, and if we could have licked the plate discreetly, we would have.  The service is outstanding, so friendly.  The owner and staff will remember you and your favorites, which is always a warm fuzzy feeling.  They even have a delicious dessert menu beyond the 3-bean drinks, which is uncommon for most Vietnamese restaurants.\n\nThe only downside is that it is in the outer Richmond so parking is horrible, but the #38 and #1 drop you off pretty much at the door.", "author": "D k."}

I am impressed that it is consistently top notch!!!! the service is great, very friendly, professional... they come and change out plates in the middle of the crab meal, they bring the water-lemon bowls for your hands, and they are attentive without being stalkerish. \n\nthis place is a well deserved 5 stars, i wish they would open another restauarnt  closer to san jose!!! writing this review makes me crave the roast crab all over again...", "author": "amy c."}

I love Vietnamese food and this restaurant is only a few blocks from my house. I've been there three times, twice for dinner and once for lunch. The lunch was great. We sat at a small table near the kitchen and the service was impeccable and the food was delicious. I was thrilled & couldn't wait to return. \n\nHowever, the next two times I returned, I could not have been more disappointed. While their food was good, it wasn't great, and the service I received both times was horrendous. I went once with my fiance and then another time (thinking the other experience was a fluke) with another couple. Both times, they NEVER checked back on our table after our food was delivered. We had empty drinks and wanted to order dessert, but were flat-out ignored by the staff. There were two servers and only 6 tables, hardly a busy night. We practically had to jump up and wave our arms to get anyone's attention. As a former waitress/bartender, I err on the side of tipping too heavily, but I had to go to 10%, which I actually felt was quite generous given their inattention. \n\nThey have a cool aquarium in the front, and really above average food, but I recommend take-out if you're going to stop by La Vie.", "author": "Sarah S."}

We were given menus and the server encouraged us to get the crab special, which under price had the word \"seasonal\" but nothing else. Now, my friend and I are poor graduate students, and we meant to inquire into the price of this dish, but forgot to do so. Needless to say when we got a bill that charged us $50 for ONE crab we felt taken advantage of. Especially because of his insistence that we buy it. Now, after some research we understand that crab can be expensive, but the least they could have done was to have the courtesy to inform us of the price of this dish. If the price isn't stated on the menu, and is subject to fluctuations as the server explained to us, I feel that a restaurant who valued their customers would inform them of the price of such a dish. We both feel like we were played for suckers by this, and it put a sour note on the end of an otherwise enjoyable evening. \n\nThis incident has marred my opinion of this restaurant, and I do not think I will ever dine here again. \n\nBUYER BEWARE!", "author": "Christopher H."}

It's got a nice evening ambiance and is great for couples or groups of 4.  I really liked the 33 beer, which has a unique aftertaste and is a great addition to the menu.  We started with the La Vie sampler, which is a couple skewers and a chance to create your own rice paper rolls.  Lots of fun, and extremely tasty.  Then it was the asparagus and crab soup - kind of plain, but good as well.  We ended up going with the coconut curry crab for an entree, and in addition to a great king crab it came with some delicious glass noodles with a sweet curry paste underneath.  \n\nThe appetizers, soup, main course, and service were all 5 stars, so why am I knocking off one?  First reason is the garlic noodles, which taste exactly like my ex used to make.  Not that they were bad, but they came with most of the crab dishes and just felt out of place.

That being said, I happened to Yelp it, and see what other people are saying about the place. Seeing that most people liked it, the husband and I decided to try it.\n\nWe started off with Beef that was wrapped in grape leaves. It came with lettuce leaves, rice noodles, mint, and bean sprouts. Very tasty indeed. Then we ordered the garlic noodles. They were ok, but I was surprised at how little we got. It was really only enough for one person on what looked like a salad plate. I guess I am used to another vietnamese restaurant around the corner where they gave you a whole bowl of garlic noodles. But so far, everything was good.\n\nThen, we also ordered a whole crab. I know that the price said, \"market price\", but again, I guess I was comparing it to the other vietnamese restaurant around the corner. Honestly, I was flabbergasted that the crab that we ate ended up being $48 - just for the crab! And it wasn't even the best crab we ever had. So for our 3 food items, 2 lemon sodas, plus tip, the meal was almost $100! Now, I'll pay good money for good food, but for two people, not expecting it at all, well, that is just ridiculous!\n\nYes, this place is a nice restaurant. White table cloths, that's for sure.

The interior is nothing fancy, but it's surprisingly cozy.  The dim lighting would probably make me a little sleepy if not for the startlingly strong Vietnamese coffee (hot) that I can rarely resist.  This coffee's got kick, you may want to steer clear if you plan to sleep within the following five hours.  It's also possible that I'm just extremely sensitive to caffeine.\n\nMoving on.  The food is perfect.  The meat is indeed high-quality, tender and flavorful.  The sauces are excellent complements, and sometimes pack as much kick as the coffee.  \n\nThe pho is very tasty, but you can get great pho all over SF, so I tend to go with other dishes unless it's a super cold night.  I highly recommend the beef luc loc.  I'm not sure I had ever had this dish before La Vie, and it's already a list-topper.  \n\nI have not yet tried the crab, but I regularly see them being delivered in 2's and 3's to other tables, and am usually jealous.  The jealously, however, tends to last only as long as it takes me to rediscover the delicious feast on my own table.  \n\nYep, well-priced, well-prepared, and the servers are super-friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-16", "description": "I debated 3 or 4 stars for La Vie bec/ it has to be one of the sleepiest, low-key neighborhood establishments, ever. If you live in the city, you want to walk out the door and find a selection of at least 3 excellent dining choices. La Vie should be one of these. The problem is I feel drowsy immediately upon walking in, and without the assistance of supremely stimulating company (which I was lucky to have both times), it's game over. The decor, service, lighting, hushed tones?  zzzzzzz.  \n\nBarring that, I can highly recommend the flaming beef and shrimp wrap appetizer, crepe appetizer, and La Vie Chicken. Wonderful. The beef and shrimp actual come out in a bowl that is set on fire. It sizzles. Satisfaction. Your typical Vietnamese restaurant won't charge half as much, but those places tend to execute a whole lot of sandwiches and noodles (which are fantastic in and of themselves), or a number of dishes that taste disturbingly Chinese. La Vie is a place for a hot sit down meal with complex dishes, fresh accompaniments (mint, basil, limes, cucumbers, sprouts, chilies), and a flavor distinctively from Indochina. I'd say it was the judicious application and intelligent blending of ngoc mum (fish sauce) with lime.\n\nSo I ended up with 4 stars bec/ the food, and everything else, is consistent. The best part is, if you do live in the area, you always have a place to go, and can walk off some of the discomfort post-dinner bec/ you gorged yourself.

We were in Asia for a few weeks and this was the ONLY restaurant we craved when we came back!  I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants and maybe cuz I'm Vietnamese, I've always been extremely picky about them.  I've tried Thanh Long - overpriced, waaaay too much MSG and oily and the worst is, the last time I had their roasted crab, it came out COLD.  Same thoughts on Crustacean's.  As for PPQ, it's good if you're on a serious budget and you're just looking for an average meal.  We've taken many family members and friends here and everyone has had a unanimous positive experience.  La Vie gets 5 stars for the following:\n\nService - friendly staff that actually SERVES you with a smile and doesn't give you attitude when you ask for anything.  Where and when was the last time you actually had great service at an Asian restaurant???\nAtmosphere - lighting is not too dim or too bright.  The patrons that frequent this restaurant have the common courtesy to turn their cell phones to vibrate mode so as not to disturb your quiet meal.  The ambiance is conducive to a nice romantic dinner for two or a quiet dinner with friends where you can actually have a conversation and actually hear each other!\nCleanliness - Sanitation has always been almost completely absent in most Asian restaurants, but this place is very clean.\nPrice - for what you get, it's going to be a bit more pricey than PPQ, but still way more affordable than Thanh Long and Crustaceans.\nFood - The best way to rate any Vietnamese restaurant is by how authentic their flavors are, especially in their Nuoc Mam (fish sauce).  This place makes an almost perfect concoction of the sauce without compromising the authenticity at all.  I hate it when Vietnamese restaurants give you phony fish sauce!  \n**Our favorite appetizer here is the Flaming Beef and Prawns.  It's served in a porcelain bowl, cooked at your table side.  The flavors really complement each other very nicely.  You can't come here and NOT order this.  The favorite dish is of course, the La Vie Roast Crab.  They take the insides of the shell and stir fry it to perfection.  The dish also comes with garlic noodles.  There are other great dishes too, but these two are our favorites.  If you go with just one other person, the appetizer along with the crab will be enough for the both of you.\n\nThe only thing I do not like about this place is the location.  Parking usually is pretty horrible here.  The longest time I've ever had to circle around for a parking space is was almost an hour.", "author": "Selene K."}

The other appetizer was highly recommended, was the shrimp cupcake, these were shrimp placed on top of mini muffin or cup cakes hallowed out in the middle, it seemed like some kind of corn meal cup cake, there were six small cupcakes and shrimp that came and a side salad to compliment.. Overall i was not impressed, the flavors were too subtle, bland and the two appetizers without drink came to $27, a bit high for lunch..", "author": "Jim W."}

It's a little fancier than the typical Vietnamese restaurants we go to, but the ambiance and service are usually worth it.\n\nHowever, we went back recently with mixed results. Here's the good, bad and the ugly.\n\nGood\nThe eggplant dish (was it garlic eggplant?) was one of the best Asian eggplant dishes I've ever had. And I've ordered eggplant at so many freakin' places that I feel like an eggplant expert by now. La Vie, I bow before your greatness -- it was that good!!!\n\nThe Bad (though not that bad)\nGinger Chicken with Ear Mush (see note below to find out what Ear Mush is) was actually pretty good except my wife didn't like the tiny ginger slivers; she thought it should've been cut bigger to make it easy to pick out. I thought the dish was pretty good but not as good as the eggplant.\n\nAs for Ear Mush, we think they meant to say Ear Mushroom. But their typo was cool; made us laugh. When we went to China years ago as tourists, we saw quite a few funny signs in English. Those signs are getting more and more rare (sigh...) as they gear up for the Olympics.\n\nThe Ugly (but not super ugly)\nWe've been here a few times over the last few years, and until recently the service has always been very good. I mean, if you're charging a bit more, the service should be good, right? Well the last time we went, the service just wasn't up to snuff. I mean, we were surprised at the lack of service. Maybe it was an off night, I don't know. \n\nBottom line: It's been a consistently good place for slightly upscale Vietnamese food, and we'd go back. Hopefully service will be back to normal next time. It's one of my favorites for Vietnamese.", "author": "William S."}

I've had something similar involving lobster at a chinese vietnamese place down in socal but this is just better. \n\nThe other items on the menu can be stellar too. The appetizers that are flame-grilled table side; the shaking beef, even the salt and pepper calimari is a standout. The noodle dishes are a bit more ordinary, though you should really get an extra garlic noodle order with the crab.\n\nA couple of quibbles: this place is not cheap; there are less expensive places to get crab (i'm told PPQ on Clement). But those crab dishes don't contain the delish spicing/crack. Also, the wines we've gotten haven't been very good.
