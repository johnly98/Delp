When I went on a Thursday night, nobody said anything and I had to discern for myself that we were waiting for the Neapolitan to come out of the oven (there was a Sicilian in the window). The window has enough space basically for one regular and one Sicilian at a time, and that's it. People who ordered toppings had them just thrown on without re-heating.\n\nSo essentially your choice is \"plain Neapolitan or plain Sicilian\" and that's it. I'm okay with that, you might not be. I actually kinda like that your choices are so limited. If ordering a full pie of course, I'd assume the topping situation would be different. The pizza doesn't need toppings though. In fact, one of the guys said \"bad choice\" when somebody ordered toppings.", "author": "J.P. M."}

It's thin crust NY style pizza. Unfortunately, I don't live close by or else I'd be there every other day. \n\nThe sauce is the best I've come across. It is authentic. The cheese melts the right way--not too thick, not burnt, not undercooked and chalky, not too thin and has that sexy elasticity when you bite and pull away from it (I don't know about the last pie of the day but I'm certain you'll be wise enough to know it might not be like the ones earlier in the day). That glorious orange oil that develops from the tomatoes and oil during the cooking process for the sauce which can pool in some areas is just right (don't mop that up with napkins--it's part of the love).\n\nThe crust is 99% right but I blame that on the Pacific air. I learned this because I have tried my tried and true NY crust recipes here and for some ungodly reason, it just doesn't work all the way and this is for most breads here as well. NY pizza crust shouldn't be bready, nor spongy, sweet, nor thick. It should be thin, hold up the pizza when fresh, crack just a bit so when you fold it it breaks at the seam, has a touch of salt, has some black spots underneath (unless when you use cornmeal under the pie in the oven) and when you get to the crust, it should look like a cross section of a toasted American English muffin. \n\nI know it's a long review but the hardest things to make are with the least ingredients. You can't get away with bad pizza unless you're going to load it up with all kinds of things to mask it. Even NY has meh pizza but I think they exist for people with no taste for the real deal. \n\nHole-in-the-walls often are the hidden treasure for food establishments.

Most of the times I've gone I haven't had a problem. However, the last time I went was an exception. I brought a friend with me. She has lived in San Francisco for almost 20 years, but she has an office job and it was right after work, so she might have slightly looked like a yuppy (she is not one). We went in, got our pizza, and the rocker dude who works there was kind of rude to us. It didn't bother me, because I think that's just the spirit of the place- but I do think he was being especially disrespectful of my friend, because he thought she might have been a part of the wave of gentrification hitting that neighborhood. We got our pizza, it was as good as always, and then we went outside and chatted for a little bit. A drunk man from out of town came up to us and started asking us what dive bars were in the area. I don't drink, so we had to talk for a long time to get him the information he wanted. I felt self-conscious about this, because I suspected that the rockers working at Arinells were hearing and judging our ridiculous conversation with this drunk (somewhat douchey) out-of-towner. \n\nAs we were talking to the drunk man, one of the rocker guys from Arinell came out and asked us if we were waiting for pizza, even though we had just sat in front of him for about 10 minutes eating pizza and then left, so I feel like he very well knew that we weren't waiting for pizza. My friend joked, \"No, but I'll take it!\" And the rocker said, \"I bet you would.\" under his breath. This upset my friend, but I didn't actually hear it when it happened.\n\n\"They probably think they're the real deal,\" she said, \"but I'm the realest deal. And the people that were here before me are even realer than that.\" I didn't totally understand what my friend was getting at, but I live in the East Bay, and I think the division between the tech yuppies and the people that have lived here for a long time, or the people that are here for other reasons is slightly less pronounced where I live than in the Mission- and especially on Valencia Street. \n\nArinell has been around for forty years, and it is a dive in a neighborhood that is being transformed into techie douche places. Acknowledging that, I don't think we get anywhere judging people who are ultimately on your side. Maybe I'm totally wrong and the guy working there is just a jerk to everyone that comes in. Anyway, it was a gnarly experience for me and my friend, and it makes me hesitant to go back. I probably will, though, because it's my favorite pizza in San Francisco, which is why I am still giving 3 stars.", "author": "Kate R."}

Yes, yes it is. It has a CRISPY ultra-thin crust and it is drenched in delicious olive oil. Why is it not my favorite all-time pizza? Well, it's not from NY of course (jk). The only thing it could use more of is a bolder flavor for the sauce and some nicer cheese (and basil). If they offered a traditional margherita slice I may be won over to say this could rank right next to the best pizza I've ever had (Di Fara's in NY).

Simultaneous to this an intoxicating smell shot up my nose - similar to how the smell of cologne shoots up your nose when walking by an Abercrombie store - except this wasn't cologne, it was pizza!

Ate it right at the counter and it was heavenly.

So, I paid the $3 and was ready to be disappointed. \n\nBUT WAIT, I wasn't disappointed and I actually devoured it. It was hot and burned the roof of my mouth. Thin and crispy, but no crumbling all over. Salty enough for my liking. Each component not standing out, but working harmoniously together. \n\nThank you for existing in this city, Arinell's.

While the list had some good choices, someone contested that Arinell Pizza was mistakenly left out of that list.  So the curious pizza-eater in me made the trek out to the Mission and stopped over to see if this person was right.\n\nVery thin pizza!  Exactly how NY-style pizza is supposed to be.  I ordered one plain cheese slice and one with mushrooms.\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjnmVuqVArA7d-syiUCiUw?select=GiyzatkB-N31pPfYCebNag#GiyzatkB-N31pPfYCebNag).\nI figured that if they can't get a simple cheese slice right, then everything else can't be good, which I was glad that they got it down nicely.  Had the right amount of gooey-ness and oily-ness that you should expect from a NY-style cheese pizza.  I liked it very much.  The mushroom pizza was good too and they really piled on the mushrooms.  My only gripe about it is that they put the mushrooms on after the slice was already cooked and reheated it, but that's more of a personal preference for me.\n\nIf you're ever in the Mission and have that pizza craving, I'd recommend Arinell Pizza just as much as that person from Pinch-it.  It's not too fancy and is pretty much a no-frills pizza joint.  In the end it's all about the pizza and Arinell's makes a very good one!", "author": "Rodney H."}

I would recommend the plain cheese over getting any toppings because the mushrooms were a little cold and the plain cheese was just so much more satisfying. \n\nThis is cheap, fast, yummy and easy to pick up food in a great location! Definitely recommend it for a quick, yet tasty meal!", "author": "Malika R."}

Unfortunately, they can be really inconsistent (e.g., some pies perfect, others way over-baked). Unrelated to the food itself is my observation that the staff always appear annoyed by the presence of customers. It doesn't offend me personally, but come on. If I were the owner I'd be embarrassed to have these guys interface with my customers. That aside, when the pizza is on point it's tough to beat Arinell in the Bay Area.", "author": "Jeff B."}

It didn't Wow me or make me say Mmm with my first initial bite like the slice of pizza I had in NYC. \n\nHowever, I did like the thinness of the pizza and how it just had the right amount of cheese and sauce on it. The slice was really huge and I probably didn't need to order a pepperoni slice too since I was quite satisfied already. This was evident by the people who just kept ordering a slice of cheese right after me.\n\nThe service was fast and efficient. Although, someone ordering a slice with toppings seemed out of the norm for them and disrupted their ebb and flow. The cashier took notice and had to separate the line between cheese only or ones with toppings - like someone choosing to order an android phone instead of an iphone. \nDisclaimer: I'm an iphone user.\n\nAlso, this place only takes CASH so have it ready or you'll definitely mess up the rotation.

I might be overgeneralizing or maybe I was too hungry, but honestly this is my favorite pizza joint in SF. NY-style pizza is my favorite type of Pizza and I am the pizza queen. I literally crave pizza in my sleep and force myself to dream about it so I don't eat late at night. \n\nFirst off, for you fatties that care a lot about size. It's huge. end of story. It's definitely bigger than my head and yeah. But that's the thing about NY-style pizza. It's huge, but not filling, because it's thin af. But that's what I LOVE about it. The thinness allows the pizza to be crispy and not too bread-y and carb-aceous (I made up this word). Most pizza you'd eat have a larger ratio of bread to cheese and sauce, but I find NY-style pizza to be just perfection. I love how simple and crispy the pizza is. IT IS GREASY AS HELL THOUGH. IT is what it is but I rike it.\n\nLet me say one thing though, service sucks! Sometimes I walk in and the guy's just on his phone and gives me NO attention. It embarrasses me.

Apparently they don't put extra salt except for in the bread, and that may make a huge difference. \n\nDefinitely go there if:\n- you are in need for some 'real' pizza\n- you only have a $5 or $10\n- it's late night and you're drunk/stoned/any and need sustenance", "author": "R B."}

We looked at a few colleges, did some shopping in the city and decided to Yelp a spot for a good slice. I have to tell ya! I've had some delicious slices on the East end of things and... I'm sorry but, Arinell's was by far the most delicious pizza I've had on both ends of the U.S. (sorry NY/Catskills). I'm so glad we ordered a large to take back to the hotel with us! We ate that baby right out of the oven then snacked on a few slices late that night. SO delicious. I also have to say that the two down-to-earth pizza artisans were totally chill, not ALL BUSINESS like you'll get on the East. They know their pizza but they weren't just tossin' you out the door with your slice! They engaged with customers, enjoyed a few laughs, suggested a deep-dish-by-the-slice to a passerby... just real service with a smile! Like another Yelper mentions, there are no frills here (specialty pizza, crazy side dishes, etc.), but the pizza's outstanding and the service is awesome!  You won't need much else! Oh, napkins! :) You'll need napkins, for sure! Anyone who complains about pizza being too greasy needs to just STOP, now! That's just crazy-talk. Pizza=greasy! \n\nbtw: I also have to disagree with the review of \"bland bread\"... here's the thing, they note that they do not use those additives that 'others' use... it's just good authentic pizza. The bread is BANGIN' because these guys know how to work it all together without the extra shortcuts people who've trained their taste-buds for the likes of pizza at their local Round Table or Dominos! \n\n*not tryin to send negativity out into the Yelp-world... just sharing my humble opinion and a bit of perspective (take it or leave it!). \n*but DO try Arinell's, and make your own informed decision!", "author": "Teresa C."}

It was definitely really good (thin, crispy, not too greasy), but when a large majority of the yelp community and 7x7 magazine rates it as one of the 100 things to eat before you die in SF, I mayhaps had a bit more expectation than I experienced. \n\nThe place is tiny and the service is quirky, which is nice as an outfit serving pizza by the slice to a largely on the go crowd doesn't really need fancy digs. Not to mention that's why I could probably have two cheese pizzas at $2.75 a pop. They were quickly heated up and as I hungrily stuffed one in my face and the other one in a to go bag, I also saw that they had a few other choices (usual suspects - pepporoni, sausage, few others). The price is definitely better than many other 'gourmet' pizza joints, but this certainly doesn't cater to that crowd. Instead it serves a simple thin crust pizza, which can be enjoyed at any point.\n\nJust don't go in with sky-high expectations and you probably won't be disappointed.

In fact there is a pizza place 2 doors down from here that sucks so bad, but it's always packed with drunk idiots. Granted, this place is tiny and there may be a wait, but it is so worth it. REAL New York pizza in a pizza parlor with New York attitude, the way it's supposed to be! And for pete's sake, by the slice the way it's supposed to be!

To me there is absolutely nothing about this pizza that would move the needle above or below that solid three star rating for \"A-OK\" describing pizza with a nice thin crust, plenty of quality cheese, and a sure hand with the toppings. (Pepperoni is the value at 50 cents extra for a slice full of it. Pay 75 cents for anchovies like I did and you'll get 3 sorry fishies, but I had been warned by somebody down this thread). \n\nDefinitely not skanky in any way but not up there with the Delfinas or even Cheeseboards of the world. The only really special thing is that the rectangular pizza is sliced into weird triangles which might get you going late at night, depending on what else was going on with you.\n\nI am going to be the 800 pound gorilla here, and speculate that most of the comments in the Arinell legend are urban myths created in many cases perhaps by the myth-tellers themselves. The guys behind the counter were not spouting classical Greek yet they were tolerant of two very unhappy women with toddlers who communicated at the staff by yelling at them.

Sure, there's Zachary's, but that ain't no pizza (it is very good though!)\n\nWhat you want, as an expatriate New Yorker, is that thin, crisp, hot, gooey slice.  The kind that you can still taste a half hour after you're done, courtesy of the grease around your mouth that you can't seem to wipe off with a napkin, no matter how you try.\n\nArinell comes close, damn close.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it's the best I've found in the city and East Bay.\n\nHowever... there was something missing in my pizza.  I don't know what it was, but some bit of taste was lacking.  According to the sign, they don't use sugar or salt in their pizza.  Perhaps that was it?  I did try adding salt to my slice (a first for me) but it didn't help.  \n\nThe place is a little dive, so don't plan on going there for your next anniversary dinner.  Get your slice and get chowing.  It's good.\n\nAs with so many things in SF, I find the prices much higher than in NY, but sometimes a man needs some hot pie, no matter what the price!", "author": "dan s."}

They don't have the space/organization to really have multiple pies ready, so that leads to the log jam. \n\nRound pizza... er... not exactly (I'm not talking about the thicker crust rectangular one)... so if symmetry is your thing, keep moving. \n\nNot the cleanest looking place... keep it off the counter if you plan on putting it in your mouth. -- message from the FDA (kinda) \n\nHaving said that, there IS a reason this place always has a line (apart from the inefficient part), whereas the 3 other places within two blocks do not. \n\nEnjoy... and my advice when you go there.

IS HUNGRY! I remembered the event stating that Arinell Pizza was right around the corner so I decided to scope it out. Let me tell you, stepping foot into Arinell Pizza at 7pm on a Tuesday evening was the best decision I made that night.\n\nLet me give you the run down. I came in here, hoping to get a slice of a sausage pizza. I stared at the counter and they only had out a huge cheese pizza. Then next to it, there was a thicker deep dish-esque cheese pizza. I stared at that, stared at the menu to find slices listed as mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, etc. I was so confused. \n\nHeidi C.: Hi do you have anything else besides cheese?\nWorker: We have everything.\nHeidi C.: (looking dumbfounded) Oh...? Then can I get 2 slices of sausage?\nWorker: Yup! \n(Worker proceeds to pick up two slices of cheese, moves the two over to his topping counter, puts on a few slices of sausage, then reheats the pizza in a huge oven)\nAt this point in time, that's when it clicked to me. You order whatever topping you want, and they put it on the cheese pizza for you! That's pretty clever since they only have to make 1 kind of pizza. Cuts down on manual labor. Very very very smart....\n\nSlice of cheese: $2.75\nToppings: $0.75\n\nOHHHHHHH and if you're a pizza oil dabber, get ready to dab your pizza here b/c it's pretty oily!", "author": "Heidi C."}

It was with that in mind that I went to grab a slice, well, TWO slices, at Arinell's.  Generally I get my New York Style fix at Speederia down in San Carlos, so I was curious how this compares. \n\nIt is now two slices later, and I'm quite pleased.  The pizza was greasy, but then, what New York Style isn't, and isn't that what napkins are for?  The cheese and sauce itself was quite good, perhaps some of the best I've had, but like the other reviewers, I agree that the toppings were less impressive.  The pepperoni was ok, while the sausage was kind of dry and basically felt like the regular Costco sausages cut up in overly thick slices and thrown on my pizza.  I definitely prefer the sausage from Speederia.  But perhaps my greatest pet peeve here was the crispiness... I expect my NY Style to have that EXTRA crispiness, and Arinell's just didn't shine on this front as much as I would have liked.  \n\nStill, if you're going to be getting pizza slices in the Mission, Arinell's is by far the best of your options, and, for myself, I know I'll be back again!", "author": "Leon K."}

The sauce is sweet and tangy, the cheese is nice and melty and the pepperoni tastes fresh. If you like deep dish like my man friend does then you'll be happy to know that they serve Sicilian deep dish as well.\n\nOrder a Neopolitan slice for 2.75 or get a 16\" for $16.50 and an 18\" for $22. Some toppings are .50 and some are .75. They include pepperoni, black olives, onion, fresh garlic, mushrooms, anchovies, sausage, green pepper, and extra cheese.

This is more to do with the abject lack of pizza outside of NY, than it does the quality of food at Arinell's. \n\nNo fuckhead, pizza isn't supposed to have a gallon of sauce on it. And no, this isn't \"thin crust\"; this is pizza. There IS only one kind. You see, on it's way over from NY, pizza stopped off in Chicago, and whaddaknow, fat as all hell Midwesterners looked at it and said \"lets make that into a thick doughy pile of crap, and I bet we can shit all sorts of wrong toppings on it, so that my ass will get even bigger.\" Yet despite its corpulence, pizza managed to struggle its way to the west coast where like most transplants from the heartland, it lost a good amount of weight, but not nearly enough. And, like most everything else in California, people put sprouts on it. This is the story of pizza.\n\n\n2. This place is truly staffed with dicks of the highest caliber. I want to punch every single person who's ever worked here, and slap their parents. In 2004 I had words with one prick in particular, who was working the register. It's not important what it was about, only that my beef was honorable. For about 8 months afterwards I had to skulk back in there only after having cased out the joint from across the street to make sure His Highness Dickwad the First wasn't working that night.

No tofu, ginseng, pesto or chicken. No sir! Only good New York toppings like bell peppers, sausage and pepperoni. Get a slice, throw on some oregano, parmasan, garlic salt and hot pepper flakes and hope to hell that the piece of waxed paper they use instead of a plate doesn't dissolve before you finish. Then go back, get another slice and start the process once again. If you're a New Yorker, you'll swear you're almost back home for a moment. \n\nArinell is a definite 5 out of 5 - the only thing that could make it better is an egg cream or a Dr. Browns Black Cherry to wash it down.\n\nAnd remember: \"Can I get a fork and a napkin?

I come from living in the east for almost a decade so I was dying to find some good NYC pizza.  This is pretty freaking close!  \n\nThe thing I don't like about it (but is exactly how many NYC places do it) is that they put the toppings on after the cheese pizza has been cooked and warm it up.  This is not a big issue for me since I'm a pizza purist who almost always gets the cheese or margherita pizza.  \n\nAnother great option is pizza by the slice.  Perfect for singles or people on the go.  Hubby and I are lardies though and can eat an extra large pie (only $24!) between the two of us.  One warning though, if you are ordering for take out, call at least 30 minutes in advance!  This is no dominos!  You'll end up circling the area with the \"Mission\" impossible task of finding parking.  The least amount of time it's taken them to bake a pie from beginning to end is half an hour!  \n\nAlso, for those spice lovers, don't forget to dump on the free jalapenos before you go!

My belief is that San Francisco's pizza scene is generally sub-par, however I'm not very easily disappointed. When it comes down to it, I'm eating melted cheese and I'm happy about that.\n\nMy cousin's husband LOVES Arinell and has been asking me weekly for months now whether I've had one of their slices yet. No, no, not yet. That is mainly because Arinell closes early. Bad business strategy in my opinion, as the post-bar-closing drunken pizza slice is a crucial way to end the night. I keep having to go to the (lesser - now I know) Cable Car pizza next door. Who even knows when that place closes... \n\nWell, I finally decided to eat pizza before 2am for once in my life, and I gave Arinell a shot. Upon walking in, I could not help but notice the clientele of tweakers that were hanging out there. I also could not help but notice the strung out employees (jamming to the Smiths or some equivalent grimy London band). Years of drug abuse have rendered them 80-pound skeletons and left them with dirty fingernails that they use to handle slices without gloves. Some may think, yuck, walk away. I prefer to ignore these telltale signs of health code violations. \n\nAnd thank god I do. Their pizza was hands down the best pizza I've had in San Francisco. I value crust above all other aspects of a pizza and their crust was perfect. Flawless. Crunchy, crispy, wonderful. And cheap. I only wish they would stay open a smidge later so I could really grub when the time is right (late-night). \n\nAnd seriously, despite the mild dirty yuck factor, everyone that worked there was really nice.

We never considered ourselves particularly fussy about pizza until we moved here.

I penalize them by one star because the cashiers add toppings to their pizzas with the same hands they handle money without washing them.\n\nHowever, most people's immune systems can handle that, so if you are willing to overlook this, I highly recommend this place.  The slices are large, thin, crisp, and delicious.  They use just the right amount of cheese and sauce on them.\n\nThe fact that the employees don't seem to care about anything and play rock CDs all the time adds to the charm.  \n\nThe place does not have a lot of seating space, so it's basically just good to grab a slice or two, eat it, and go.  But that also adds to its charm.  \n\nIf you want to minimize the chances of infection, just order a slice of cheese.  That's what I do.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-14", "description": "Arinell is to NY Style Pizza what Zachary's is to Chicago style. About 90% authentic, and worth every bite if you love thin crust pizza. Now, it's very true they can be inconsistent so YMMV but please, don't just go once thinking you got ripped off. I got your back, so let me break it down for ya on the good and not-good of Arinell's NY Style:\n\nYay! What they do right:\n- As a previous posters remarked, the best balance of cheese, sauce, and grease you'll find on an authentic NY style pizza slice made in San Fran. The sauce is spiced perfectly - slightly sweet, but with enough of the right savory spices to make it best enjoyed WITHOUT TOPPINGS. 8/10 on the sauce.\n\n[Digression about pizza sauce - go on and skip this unless you're really bored because I spew about pizza sauce for my own, therapeutic need. And I need to talk about pizza sauce or I'll go mad!\nThe difference in pizza sauce is foretold by the tomatoes or tomato product that goes into it. Most pizza places in San Francisco use plain tomato sauce for the base or even worse, mix water with thick tomato paste. But if you walk into any decent pizza place in the greater New York or New Jersey area, look far behind the counter. You will see in the dingy back room, massive cans stacked upon cans of whole tomatoes. GASP! That's right, they start with whole, canned tomatoes and make the pizza sauce fresh - and that my friends, makes all the difference between schwag and great-tasting pizza. \nAhem. Now, back to your regularly scheduled review.]\n\n- The slices are large, and can be folded length-wise as is commonly done on the East coast.\n- They crust is wafer-thin! Slightly crispy, just enough so that you can hold it up without it flopping over and scorching your wrist.\n\nMkay, so what DON'T they do right?\n- Um, what's up with the 1 1/2\" edges of  crust surrounding the pizza? Sure, a good thin crust pizza must have a substantial edge of crust to grip but much like the less-authentic Escape From NY Pizza, there's too much crust around the pie and you gotta wonder whether or not they really wanted to make you a large pizza or, were making a medium with extra crust on the edges. If you love crust, ignore my nit-picking.\n- They will often over-cook their pizzas - and you'll know right away when you see the cheese is brown-orange or when you can hold a slice by the very edge of the crust and the body of the slice defies gravity. \n- The pizza guys are total slackers and it takes a little faith to believe that you're gonna get a good pizza.\n\nSuggestions:\n*** To those reviewers who said from their experience, the pizza had no taste, or tasted like cardboard or was too crispy. **** \nI don't doubt your experience. But the nature of running a pizzeria that sells slices is, they must make a whole pie and then re-heat the slices as they're ordered. Therein lies the fault! Re-heated pizza loses about half it's flavor and even more tragic, there's no way to keep the crust from turning into a cracker-like consistency. So! To avoid the deleterious effect of re-heating, a few things I recommend:\n1. simply order your slice as-is. Meaning, warm. \n2. wait for them to put a fresh pie up on the counter.\n3. Order a whole pie for $22. Take them about 20 minutes to make it fresh - but make sure they make it fresh and don't re-heat one of the pies below the counter!\n\nAnother consideration is that the pizza cannot be delivered so if you're thinking of transporting the pie, be practical. It's gonna loose heat when it travels - even on a hot day. I bought a pie the other day and drove it from Valencia to the Inner Richmond. Even though it was 80 degrees on the thermometer, the pizza was still room temp when I got home. \n\nNow, don't think that stopped me from binging - GF and I ate the whole damn pie and it was yum and I'm not whining about it being warm not hot. But, it was over-cooked. The inconstancy of their preparation, the fact that the product - even re-heated in their own pizza oven - loses alot of flavor and texture, and the fact that seating and eating at Arinell is only fine if it's you and maybe one other (and if you dont let your hand touch the under-side of the countertop)? I feel I have to warn you that YMMV at Arinell.\n\nStill, 4 stars for making the bestest NY style pizza in San Francisco. Alot of pretenders out there *cough cough Amici's cough* but this is the one place that actually knows what a NY style pizza should taste like and despite inconsistency, I'll keep coming back for my fix.", "author": "Ben S."}

I have always loved Arinell's. However, I know New York Slices and Arinell's does not have New York Slices. \n\nEating a good New York slice is a voyage into cheese.

Like one of those crafty water bugs that can appear to be a poisonous spider but is far more benign. This is not a bad thing. Arinell's is not overladen with cheese, nor is it burdened with too much of anything (sauce, cornmeal dusting, flavor). A marvel of crispy consistency. Arinell's regular slice (I never touch that Sicilian stuff), especially sans toppings, is a benchmark for dependability. A cold San Francisco day is lightened (much like the tender-firm crisp goodness of the crust) by the consumption of a slice whilst on the move.

I was hungry. I needed something fast.

And one thing I know I know. Excellent NYC pizza. I've eaten a ton of it (and am still so svelte what IS my secret?) There is a place on Gilman in Berkeley that almost has it nailed - I always forget the name because one of my divorce counselors was just down the block - and the pizza made it all worthwhile!)\n\nFact is that there are FIFTY different types of NYC pizza. Brick oven, Coal oven. What we're talkin' here is the stuff where the grease runs out of the slice even if you just tilt it 10 degrees.\n\nArinells has the grease down to a science. It's like they add it purposely. The crust ain't bad. The sauce is fine. It's the atmosphere that gets the 5 stars for me. Parking on Mission in front of some of the funkiest homeless encampments in the city.  \n\nAnd yes, it's been said - but my experience might have been the best:\nGUY 1: (In a hoodie) \"My welfare check is a week late, how much ya got.\nGUY 2: \"Three.\"\nGUY 1: \"I got .75, I think we're there.\"\nGUY 2: \"HEY, TURN THAT SONG UP\"\n\nPIZZA GUY TURNS UP THE SONG ON THE TINNY BOOMBOX REALLY LOUD. INDETERMINABLE ROCK AND ROLL, NOT TOO METAL, NOT BAD ACTUALLY, EVEN TO THE WRITER OF THIS REVIEW WHO IS MORE INTO BRIT POP BY FAR.\n\nGUY 1 LEAVES WITH THE SLICE. GUY 2 STAYS TO HEAR THE MUSIC, PAYS MORE THAN GUY 1 AND GETS NOTHING BUT THE MUSIC.\n\nLunch that day was a slice of Arinell's and a Apple Turnover from the Mission Beach Cafe. Yes, I had healthier food for dinner, thank you.\n\nSo, is Arinells AUTHENTIC New York pizza? No way. Is it risking your life for? Go during the day, the corner is dicey.

Basically, the opposite of every California pizza place with the inch thick cheese barrier.\r\n\r\nAnd the taste/texture more than surpassed our hopes. It was like being in a time warp back to 1980 to the pizza party my little league team had at Kay's Pizza on Maple Ave.\r\n\r\nEverything about Arinells is purposeful and perfect, from the slightly grungy interior (Most places take time to develop that vibe but they had it on grand opening day).

To the slices with the occasional bubble in the dough.To the slightly aloof, but actually cool people who I truly believe take pride in the pizza they serve.\r\n\r\nMy pizza boycott (except free pizza at work etc) of California pizza is officially over thanks to Arinells.", "author": "midas r."}

Shut up health nuts.) the sauce is generally lacking, but the cheese almost makes up for it. \n\nAs for the sanitation, well, you do risk getting hepatitis from the counter guy taking the money from the crackhead, then putting pepperoni on your slice without any thought of hand washing.

Still, worth hitting up if in the area.  Small eating area, which I imagine would be a problem when it gets busy, unless you can bring the slice into a bar.

However, the crust itself is...crunchy? I'm used to a little sloppier crust that can barely hold what's on it from nyc actually. But this is a good thing that it has a crunchy crust, the cheese to sauce ratio is usually perfect, and I usually just get a plain cheese slice. It's the way to go! I like how they cut it different triangular lengths that are larger than normal slices. That way you can fold it  with no problems!

Some trick I'm missing?\nAnyway, though I'm from CA, my parents are both from the east (mom NY, dad Boston) so we'd spend every summer there, and y'know what?  I was convinced until last week that we in the land of fruits and nuts were incapable of making real pizza.  On our East Coast travels, we rarely eat anything but pizza.  Even the crappy chain pizzerias back east are better than all the \"gourmet\" stuff (sorry, but garlic roasted chicken pizza with cheese in the crust and a side of ranch dressing is not edible) our great state offers.  Though I still do not comprehend the reason for this, I have learned over the last 30 years to accept it.  We have better weather, bla bla bla.  Anyway, I had heard about Arinell's, but I'd already been burned twice on my quest for pizza.  But I was stuck in the mission the other day, so I went in for a slice.  It wasn't even that fresh, but it tasted......It tasted like PIZZA!!  Thin, foldable, greasy, not too heavy on anything.  Maybe that's the secret?  It's not smothered in stuff that doesn't belong on pizza?  I don't know, but I'm going back soon, and I'm bringing my parents.", "author": "Alexander T."}

The thin crust cheese pizza by the slice caught our attention, so we walked in and ordered a slice to share.  The server, who had just returned change to the customer before us, used his hand (no gloves), picked up our slice, and put it into the oven to warm up.  He then took our money, helped the next customer, and later served us our pizza.  I had already seen him do this a couple of times, but my husband just had that lightbulb go off on his head and whispered, \"Did you notice that he touched our pizza with the same hands that touched the money?\" to which I answered, \"Yeah, but he put our pizza into the oven, so hopefully the heat killed all the germs.\"  I'm pretty sure he slid the pizza onto the paper for us rather than touch it again with his hands, but I don't know that for sure.  Pretty much what we decided was that if they were closed down, we wouldn't have the best NY style pizza ever!\n\nPizza is extremely thin, although a little floppy but still crispy.  If I were eating my entire meal there, I would definitely need two slices though.

We all know how Mission customers can be, obnoxious, drunk, demanding and oblivious, but these guys no matter what, have the irritability and lousy customer service of a bunch of strung-out teenagers coming down from some serious drugs and are super slow from wake-and-all-day-bake. But, hey it is  a quick slice if that's what you are after. The \"holier-than-thou, elitist\" attitude from a bunch of misanthropes is going to blow you away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-22", "description": "Arinells Pizza is a horrific establishment that has literally killed my love for pizza. My boyfriend and I recently stopped by around 10pm on a Saturday night, looking for a couple of hot, low-fi slices to enjoy after a long evening at Dolores Park. \n\nWe were immediately off put by the disgustingly greasy, old, and unattractive slices displayed in the glass pizza cabinet, but tried to remain optimistic that the fresh slices that they make to order would be better. We apprehensively order a slice of cheese pizza with olives, bell peppers, and mushrooms. The attendant informs us that toppings are $.75 each, almost as if to deter us from ordering any toppings whatsoever. \n\nMy boyfriend notes that the price is not an issue, as at this point we had decided against Little Star Pizza after being informed that the wait would be approximately 25minutes for dinner. If only we had stayed at Little Star! But more about that later. . \n\nInstead  of constructing a fresh slice, our Heroin-addled, greasy, anorexic attendant, whose smile shown of tooth decay and dental neglect, grabbed a slice of thin, greasy cheese pizza and threw a big soggy handful of olives, bell peppers, and pre-cooked mushrooms onto the pizza, and charged us $4.75 for what was the least attractive serving of food I've seen in years. At this point, the eye contact between my boyfriend and I shrieked: \"Why didn't we just go to El Farolito's?!?!?\" but we stayed and awaited our Arinells slice. \n\nAfter about 15 seconds in the oven, we were handed our slice of lukewarm pizza. We both took bites, and soon discovered that this slice was the blandest, soggiest food we'd ever eaten. There were No, I repeat no redeeming factors to this slice. First of all, the toppings looked old and canned. The pizza itself had a millimeter of cheap greasy cheese covering tasteless sauce, and even the crust was soggy! \n\nAlthough my boyfriend protested, I brought the slice of pizza up to the front counter, explained that the slice was sub-par, and politely asked for a refund. The other pizza crony, who was apparently quite used to defending the joint's deplorable meals, noted that Arinells pizza slices \"aren't designed to handle as many toppings.\" Not DESIGNED to handle toppings? In this case, wouldn't it be logical to advertise a one-topping max? \n\nToothless heroin junkie was highly insistent on NOT giving me back my money, and at that points, we threw their slice of pizza in the trash and left. Although I was tempted to camp outside their restaurant and deter future customers from walking in and wasting their own hard earned American dollars on this joke, I decided to take the high road and walk down to El Farolito's instead. \n\nThis place is a sad sad joke. I recommend Seniore's Pizza on 19th and Taraval instead.", "author": "julia s."}

The bacon dog was good, but we wanted variety.  We decided to stop in at Arinell for a slice of NY.  Touted for their NY-style pizza, we were game to try it.  The first thing you notice is that the slices come from super huge pies.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have some sort of slice specials.  It's basically cheese pizzas to which they add the topping after you order.  I personally prefer my toppings to be cooked together, rather than just warmed up.  To their credit, their crust is thin and crispy.  Much better than some of the other NY-style joints that I've tried.  It almost reminded me of a Neopolitan pie, which is good thing.  It's a small shop with room for maybe 6-8 to sit/stand around.  This is something I'd have anytime of day...whether I'm intoxicated or not.  All in all for the night, it was a satisfying foodie excursion.

It is better than that painful pizza place a couple doors down, but this is not NY.  Then, there's the the fact that I feel \"funny\" about 1/2 hour after I eat here-- everytime!  Even though the pizza goes down pretty well, that good feeling doesn't follow through.  SO, here's the good news-- they have a great crust.!  It's close to NY-style, with thinness, crispiness and the right level of char from the oven.  But, there never seems to be enough cheese or sauce on the Neapolitan-style.  And, the sauce (partly because of the lack of it) doesn't hold enough of its own savoury goodness (italian spices and hint of sweet garlic) than even EFNY's formula pies.  So, I have reservations about the thin crust sauce, cheese ratio.  Here's where they get KUDOS-- the Sicilian slice is where it's at.  For those of you ill-informed, that's the square kind where you get to choose whether you want an end or middle piece (if there's any left).  The dough (presumably the same as the thin but just more of it) on the Sicilian pie is the kind of fluffliness reminiscent of those family-style NY places with seemingly enough sauce and a good scatter of cheese- BUT, it's still not NY.  There is a totally logical reason for this being that NY WATER is different than SF water so the pizza dough (and the bagels, and the pretzels, and the street hotdogs) will never been the same.

Maybe this is how they do it in brooklyn, but this pizza can't compete with my top 10 favorites in manhattan.  I decided to seek out this place based on a lot of rave reviews, but I'd say that it was just OK.  Perhaps the pizza is better at night, as one other review says.  I went early in the day and the pizza on the counter looked old, dry and downright unappetizing.", "author": "D W."}

I didn't believe them until I had my first bite.  The dripping orange oil, oozing, chewy mozzarella, and tasty tomato sauce - I felt like I was at the old neighborhood pizzeria.  The crust is thinner and crispier than a typical NY slice, but I like it that way.", "author": "Lisa F."}

Where this place falls short is the exorbitant cost for a large pie.  $20 for crust, sauce, and cheese is still too high for me.  Perhaps I need to adjust my cost-of-living to accept this, who knows.", "author": "Interphace C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-24", "description": "Piping hot, melty cheese pizza with thin perfectly crispy crust. The whole thing practically melts in your mouth. Cute metalhead/surfer type guys serving it up. Not to mention heavy metal playing most times. Ample toppings. If I'm walking down Valencia and starving, a slice or two at Arinell is the best thing ever. Chowing down on that while listening to \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" is pretty much heaven. Docked one star because they sometimes serve with bare hands, though it's really just part of the whole seedy ambience.", "author": "Meg B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-30", "description": "By SF standards this is the best pizza in town.  Thin NY style that beats any of the California style imposters.  No goat cheeze or artichoke hearts on this pie!  You can add toppings but I recommend going with the slice of cheeze.   Great vibe to the place.  Only bummed out once when the tattooed punk rocker behind the counter had a wet hacking cough.  Also, it's a small place but that's why God gave you legs and the ability to walk and chew at the same time.", "author": "Ken P."}

As an East Coast transplant, I can say with reasonable certainty that the only thing the West does not do better is pizza.
