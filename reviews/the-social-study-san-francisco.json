It's even sadder when rich folks pat themselves on the back for pretending they've brought it back with a snooty establishment devoid of any heart whatsoever. \n\nLet me explain. First, my cappuccino was terrible. The bartender looked like he was going to have a temper tantrum when I ordered it too. I think he just didn't want to turn the machine on. He also tried to charge me for my date's drink, even though I said we were paying separately, twice. And it wasn't loud in there at the time. I took it as a subtle way of letting me know my date was out of my league/income bracket. None of the bartender's business, really. And why would he try and charge me for both of our drinks? \n\nBecause that's what the SF service industry has become. Kiss up to the rich, save the good stuff for them, and treat everyone else like crap/make their food and drinks taste like crap (like in Black Mirror, Nosedive, when she orders a brushed suede or whatever). And, while I'm down with the diverse literature on the shelves, and the Black Lives Matter and jazz posters, it comes off as kinda fake when you consider how the bartenders treat lower income artists like me- much worse than someone like my date, who apparently exuded that woke/wealthy/well-read vibe that is the essential combination for getting good service here. His online profile seemed much more down to earth. I thought this place would be too.", "author": "Shaina R."}

I think the beers weren't outrageous either, something like $7 per beer?\n\nI find it funny that there were actually people there still studying at night when it clearly became a bar at night. I like it and think it's quirky but omg some people do not lower their laptop's screen brightness. The rest of the bar is pretty dark, so blinding light coming from people's laptops was kind of annoying.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

The bar was a little dark and loud with the live DJ but everyone seemed to be having fun.

We ordered a few beers, sangria, and a lemon drink. The beers were nice and cold, the sangria had a good taste to it but seemed a little watered down, but the lemon drink was just right.\n\nWe tried to order food but the kitchen was closed so we had to continue our food adventure elsewhere.\n\nThey also had seating and space for people to play card games and board games, all provided by the bar which is a great touch.\n\nMay visit again for another relaxing night of drinks, music, and games.", "author": "Camera P."}

The place has a great vibe: books line the shelves, the brick wall on one side gives it a sort of old rustic feel, and the music is on point (a lot of 90s pop, hip hop, and r&b, as well as some less annoying modern tunes). It's a nice spot to grab a drink and chill with friends, but definitely better suited for groups of 2 or 4 based on how the seating is arranged. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the Chocolate Factory and Buzzkill, both of which include Guinness stouts. I really liked the first drink, especially when I saw the bartender grab a pound of Trader Joe's chocolate and grate the chocolate straight on top of the drink. It wasn't too sweet and the stout added a smooth flavor that wasn't overpowering. With the Buzzkill, I instantly smelled the bitter espresso but the Guinness definitely balanced out that flavor to be quite enjoyable. Both drinks were $9 each, and the Buzzkill actually came in a tall glass so we got our money's worth - however you probably won't get turnt off of this LOL.\n\nThe storefront is pretty plain and inside isn't very spacious, but hopefully it'll stay lowkey and not get too popular because I don't want it to get crowded lmao.

As the evening rolls around, the lights get dimmer, and the loungey/R&B music starts to play, converting the space into a happening spot for friends to convene or for great dates to happen :). \n\nI love their unique spin on cocktails that are categorized as either winetails, beertails, or soju cocktails (karatetails). From their winetails, I recommend the Little Apple - delicious taste! For beertails, the Chocolate Factory is decadent. For a karatetail, order The Crane!

I have a thing for brick walls (they remind me of home) so plus 20 stars right there obviously. But in all seriousness, the ambiance is dope. Awesome music (lot of 90s hip hop and R&B- which will win me over every time), nice looking young crowd, movie projected a movie on the brick wall...ready to drink all the drinks now please!\n\n.....and that's exactly what we did. What was supposed to just be a drink or two turned into three or four...or was it five? Don't you love those type of nights?! Well we haven't had one of those since we moved from New York so I would like to think that this alone is very telling of Social Study's vibe. We just enjoyed the atmosphere so much that the cabernet sauvs basically poured themselves and made their way over to our cozy little table (which is a quirky little set up by the way). The barentder was cool and I hate myself for not remembering his name but we basically closed the bar out with him. \n\nI definitely want to come back soon and try out the food and other drinks. It's a great place for a date night or a group of friends.........err but don't all at once go the same night I'm there please!! ;)", "author": "Monica T."}

The people are also nice and the decor is cozy, intimate, and I don't have to yell to be heard. You don't feel weird if you just wanna come and read and have a glass of wine. There's always at least one guy at the bar with his laptop just hanging out.\n\nIt's close to Kabuki theater so its fun post or pre show.

The SO and I were waiting to eat at SBP and wanted to kill some time -- this place is pretty nearby so we decided to give it a visit around 7pm on a Sunday night. \n\nThe Social Study is effectively half cafe, half bar -- neat combo. The decor is pretty cool -- chairs that flip out from the walls, plugs underneath the bar, books lining the walls -- it feel like that secret hideout that you've always wanted to do your work. It's also got large wooden tables for larger parties and some small nooks against walls with comfy seating. Overall, just a really neat space to be in.\n\nThey have a pretty good food/snack menu and drinks and Four barrel coffee! We got the cookies and milk and a latte. The best part about the cookies are that they actually bake them the minute that you order them, so they come out of the oven hot and delicious. The latte was also fairly decent -- a little too foamy but still decent. The SO got the fresh squeeze IPA that he was pretty happy with.\n\nThe Fillmore area has a surprising lack of coffee shops, so I love that the Social Study fills that gap. It's got a great vibe despite being half study space and half bar -- looking forward to visiting this place again in the future. \n\ntldr; really neat cafe and bar -- yummy snacks too! would highly recommend, great scene", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Yes, the music is turned up and you still have to project but they have sound foam all over the ceiling which eliminates the echo.

There are seats at the bar, and the tables, and there are also little nooks in the front with benches that are intimate and a nice place to just sit and talk. They also have a collection of board and card games which was a great touch!\n\nWe didn't know they only served beer and wine until we came in, and although I was looking to get something a little stronger I didn't mind it. They also have a list of wine and soju cocktails (called 'Karatetails'), so I decided to try the Goldeneye. It was pretty good - just would have been better with a shot or two of something!

I loved the intimate and small space of the cafe/winebar. You can see that in the mornings this place is gunning for a study atmosphere but around 5 it turns into a great happy hour/date night place. We were initially going to get a cheeseboard but then we saw the great promo/happy hour offered on sundays .. which by the way ends ends at 9, we decided to get that! For 9 dollars you get 2 fairly small but nicely sized bbq sliders, a very small cole slaw and a draft beer. Sandwiches were nicely done, spicy meaty and very tender. They only have 5 beers on tap, and I opted for a pilsner and overall I left very satisfied .", "author": "Eleana H."}

I tried the Yellow Diamond (lillet blanc, prosecco, and mandarin peel) which was refreshing without being overly sweet. A little pricey at $9, considering it isn't as strong as either a glass of wine or a regular cocktail, but fine for a one-time try.\n\nI also wish the kitchen stayed open even an hour later. I stopped by after a Kabuki movie where I'd skipped dinner, and missed the kitchen closing at 9:30.

Two types, in fact - both a prankster and a PranQster.  The former thinks he's funny.  The latter tastes awesome.  Though, I guess I should be thanking the prankster for introducing me to The PranQster.  \n\nA coffee shop by day and a bar by night, The Social Study is similar to Sugar Cafe down by Union Square (minus the hard alcohol).  However, I like the vibe here a lot better.  While Sugar Cafe is a little more spacious and trendy, The Social Study is smaller with a much more intimate and mellow vibe.  Which, essentially, makes them my kind of spot.  Of course, it didn't hurt that the DJ was playing a bunch of 90's hip-hop either.\n\nSince we were only stopping in for drinks after having dinner at State Bird, I can't speak to the bar bites listed on the menu (or the cafe offerings, for that matter).  However, I did like the selection of beers and wines that were available.  Especially the PranQster.  The giant ass bottle it came in was a little unexpected (\"Dude, it's that small bottle, not the big one.\"), but it certainly was delicious!\n\nWith its relaxed ambiance welcoming nature, and relatively cheap prices, I'd definitely come back to The Social Study, whether it be for some coffee, enjoying a drink or two with friends, or to cap off a hot date with a girl.  After all, things only get livelier when there's a little PranQster in you!", "author": "Mike L."}

Only the chicken salad sandwich. Which was so good, I had to come back only 2 weeks later. (I live nowhere near this area). When I was there in the day originally, there were lots of people with their laptops out. This seems like a great little place to get some work done during the day. They have a good coffee and tea selection. It kind of doubles as a cafe/bar.\n\nNext time I was there, my friend and I met for drinks and stayed all night. It's definitely an intimate setting. Lots of seating for 2 people, some community high tops but that's about it. Music selection is always inspiring. First time I was there they were playing motown, last time they had a DJ that was really matching the vibe of the place.\n\nThe staff is incredibly endearing and pretty cute too. They recommended drinks to us all night and we loved everything we had. I think they only sell beer, wine, and agave wine and such - no hard liquor - but I hardly missed it. And I'm a die-hard bourbon girl. I was impressed at the inventiveness and sheer tastiness of the cocktails we had. We left very sauced up and happy.\n\nI highly recommend this little hideaway bar for the type of person who prefers a more intimate and curated experience. 5 stars.", "author": "Jenna K."}

There were just a handful of us so we ended up working our collective butts off first preparing and assembling appetizer and dessert plates then walking around the venue serving dozens upon dozens of rounds of appetizers to paying guests.  The event staff kept us well hydrated, and the awesome chefs from Charles Phan's Slanted Door kept us well fed and even packed up some huge plates of leftover delicacies for all of us to take home.\n\nAll that work left us drained though and we really needed a place to just sit down, chill and reboot for the evening.  Social Study was just around the corner.  We looked inside and saw there was an empty communal table that could fit all of us so we decided to give them some business for the night.\n\nThe place is darkly lit mostly from dim overhead lighting very high above on their acoustically enhanced ceiling and by bowls of flickering candlelight on the table tops.  The Social Study theme is well represented with books (many were law reference books of the kind that nobody actually reads) stacked and lined across one wall atop comfortable looking individual booths.\n\nTheir menu is quite varied featuring small bites, many wines, draft and bottled beers and hot coffee drinks served in round bowl-like mugs.  You order at the bar, get your drinks and return to your table.  The bar staff was working in slow motion though and as more people walked in the line just grew longer and longer.  I guess having a varied drink menu doesn't always work in their favor.  We heard one of the ladies behind the bar apologize a few times for the long wait.  It all worked out and we all got our drinks eventually.\n\nThe tall wooden chairs weren't super comfortable but it was a seat and all of us really just wanted to sit down.  We toasted the night knowing that all of us worked really well together and we had just rocked a successful fundraiser for an awesome school.  My bottled beer was ice cold, and we were getting the rest we wanted so badly.\n\nAs the place became more crowded we found ourselves having to speak louder and louder just to hear each other.  They had loud hip-hop (Jay-Z, Beastie Boys, etc...) music blaring in the front of the house and they were projecting the movie \"Sin City\" high above the brick wall.  I enjoyed the random scenes of ultra violence on the big screen, but the combination of loud music, loud conversation and other people crowded behind our chairs grew tiring very quickly.  We finished our drinks and collectively agreed to get out of there.\n\nFor just a moment this was a great place to chill.

I love \"craft cocktails\" but the whole speakeasy, industrial rustic, fancy cocktail bar is really getting tired in this city and I've been yearning for something different. I realize how ridiculous I sound complaining about craft cocktail bars but it's the truth. Enter the Social Study. They've got great cocktails and a solid wine list, so they check that box off. The feel of this place is awesome and what sets it apart. It's some sort of mix of the 90s and a bit of So-Cal skater vibe all perfectly wrapped up into an intimate bar with a Brooklyn feel. It sounds eclectic but it all blends together perfectly. They also have a snacks list including homemade chocolate chip cookies and milk if you decide you need something to nibble on.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-29", "description": "This place is too cool! Coffee shop, bar, and study lounge all rolled into one. I've been searching for some time for somewhere that I can do work and really get into the zone. The Starbucks on Fillmore just hasn't been cutting it recently. Loud, closes early, and awfully exposed to outside distractions. Walk a little bit south on FIllmore though and take a left at Geary, and you're in a completely different world! \n\nFirst off, I'm a huge fan of dim-lights when I do work and when I do drank. And sometimes even when I do eats. So I knew when I set foot in The Social Study that I would enjoy my time there. The very very first thing I noted beyond the dim lighting was the general atmosphere about the place. Macbooks scattered about with their lights glowing bright in the low light, coffee cups and wine glasses at everybody's side, and the occasional group of friends/couples engaged in conversation. There was a DJ booth one floor above, although it was empty when I was there (9 pm on a Sunday night) and a movie being projected onto a wall with hip hop playing in the background. FANTASTIC. I don't fancy myself a hipster, but I do enjoy it when a cafe gives off a hipster vibe and this place fit the bill. Even had a book shelf with books on the side. \n\nI'm not a huge coffee drinker (especially at 9 pm) and it was a bit late for grub so I just ordered up myself some tea and got to work by joining the ranks of customers with their Macbooks out. Got some productive work done and left after last call. I'm definitely coming back here for my studying/productive needs, and most likely coming here for my eating and drinking needs too.", "author": "Philip W."}

The vibe is excellent and incredibly chill. Its almost scary to write a review about it because it feels like such an unknown secret but really people should know about this place cause they deserve all the business. \n\nLocated just a couple blocks from the shopping and restaurants of upper Fillmore and far enough from the sketchy parts of the Fillmore its is the perfect location for grabbing drinks on a date or after work. There are never a ton of people here which is really great. If don't want it to feel like work to go to a bar then this is your place. It is a very small location with minimal seating at the bar or otherwise. You are welcome to stand make your own seating. There are games as well for those wanting some board game action. There are also books everywhere. I forget the story but they are incredibly random and fun to thumb through. There is an attic above the bar area where a DJ plays tunes on random nights and during the weekend. \n\nSometimes there are random movies and old tv shows being displayed on the wall. I never know what its going to be so I can't tell you what to expect. I saw scooby doo once but then I love lucy another time so yea who knows.\n\nThe music deserves its own five stars. Whether its a dj or a set playlist in the background you will hear some of your favorite 90's R&b or even classic blues and soul like Otis Redding or Sam Cooke. The best playlist in the city hands down. \n\nIts very dark in the place which adds to its chill vibe plus wifi makes it a great place to get work done or drink with someone special. The bartenders are excellent and their drink menu is incredibly fun. There are mixed drinks that are very rare and exclusive to the social study. You owe it to yourself to try them. \n\nIts usually really quiet and intimate here which makes it perfect for meeting people or dates. Candles flickering dark atmosphere and being surrounded by couples feels good. \n\nWhether you are looking to kill sometime before heading into Fat Angel or seeing a band at the Fillmore this place is the best reason to come into this area.

With recent additions to the project-lined streets like Maven (well, more Lower Haight... but still within a doable walking distance), State Bird Provisions, and now The Social Study (to go along with pre-existing hot spots like Fat Angel, 1300 on Fillmore, Yoshi's, etc...), the Western Addition sure is making a run at being one of the niftiest destinations in town.\n\nThe Social Study is right up my alley -- they carry a wide array of different wines from all over the globe, feature piquant small bites like artisan cheese and charcuterie boards, and the space has a hip, minimalist vibe that'll make you feel right at home the moment you boot, scoot, and boogie through their front doors along Geary. It's still in its infancy being open only a handful of days at this stage in the game, but as they find their sea legs and carve a niche into a part of town lacking similar haunts, I can see this being the type of place I dip into before any show at the Fillmore or an evening romp at the Kabuki. \n\nBeer and wine only, but word has it their sangria is second to none. Will have to give that a go next time!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

Instead of shoving our way in, we decided to go down the street to Social Study.\n\nThey have a pretty nice list of wines by the glass and they also do wine cocktails. That's what I went for and I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a Nojito which was white wine, soda, lime and mint. So basically a mojito but with wine instead of rum. It was really delicious! For the second round I got a Agavarita which was like a mango margarita but with agave wine instead of tequila. Again, really good. My friend had a few glasses of red and enjoyed them. They also have a beer list but we didn't get to that.\n\nThe space itself is cute. They have some nice longer tables so you can fit a group of 4 or even 5.

Very attractive space, friendly owner, great coffee. I was there between 11 am and 1 pm. Several parking spaces were available nearby.

The owner offered and brought me a glass of water without my asking, which was very nice. The wifi is free (the owner will give you the key), and it worked well.\n\nThe downsides are minor: Outlets are scarce because of the brick walls. Some conduit along the floor could take care of that. There were outlets at the bar, at the table nearest the bar, and at tables near the window.  As pretty as the inside is, the view outside is of a a wall of the Geary underpass.\n\nI would have spent more money if they served lunch, but the kitchen doesn't open until 4.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-17", "description": "I hate to give a new establishment a so-so review, but my first visit to the Social Study was a bit less than stellar. \n\nA girl friend and I came in at around 8:45pm on a Saturday night. We were the only two patrons in the establishment as we came in just as a couple others were leaving. No one greeted us, so we decided to seat ourselves. A quick look around and we saw some wall-seats (two-tops with small tables jutting out of the right-hand wall; seats without backs), and some bigger tables for groups on the left side of the room. Since no one else was there we opted to sit at a bigger table. We sat for a few minutes but no one came around despite seeing the bartender at the bar, so we grabbed some menus from another table. After perusing the menu and making our choices over the next several minutes and still nobody came around, I got up and placed our orders at the bar. Strange that despite being the only two in the whole place, and especially for a new establishment, the bartender and other staff made no effort to greet us or offer us any tips/pointers about the menu.\n\nWe each had a glass of SANFRANGRIA ($7) and we shared the BRANCH & BOARD CHEESE PLATE ($9). The sangria was solid - I liked that they included fruit in our glasses and that the apples and pears were not so wine-soaked that they were inedible. It was nice to munch on a few cubes of fruit along with our cheese plate.\n\nThe cheese plate was fine - it included a blue cheese w/ honey, a gruyere, and a cheddar, with a small cluster of grapes and a couple of small slices of bread. The blue cheese paired very well with the honey. Unfortunately, the bread was fairly stale, and there were not nearly enough slices of bread for the amount of cheese on the plate - there were only 6 pieces of 1.5\" rounds of bread. Eventually I was smearing blue cheese onto the slices of gruyere and cheddar as we ran out of bread. The cheese plate would be much improved if they included either more bread, or opted to offer some crackers instead. \n\nNote about the ambience: The room was quaintly decorated and was sufficiently dim for a low-key feel. The music could use some help - it was way too loud and I couldn't discern any theme to their mix. At one point they were playing oldies, which then turned into pop and even some EDM. Hmm...\n\nOver the course of the hour and a half we spent there, the bartender only came by to bring us our sangria and cheese but she never came by again to ask how we were doing. A man, who appeared perhaps to be the owner, came by once to ask us how we were enjoying our drinks and cheese. At one point, a large group of people came in and congregated near the bar area. They appeared to be the bartender's/owner's friends, and the staff dedicated all their attention to this group of people while ignoring the two of us. Eventually when we wanted to pay and leave, we took out our cash and had it laying on the table for quite some time. Clearly no one was paying attention to us, so I got up and handed cash to the bartender, who took the money without asking if we wanted any change. We had included enough in the amount of cash to account for tip, but it was a bit rude of her to not even look at the amount and ask if we needed change. \n\nOverall, the prices were fair and the ambience was fine save for the music being too loud. They've got a great concept going on and a solid menu and drink list as far as I can tell. If The Social Study could fix the bread-to-cheese ratio and seriously improve their customer service, I could see myself coming back.", "author": "Megan L."}

We ordered our drinks, a honey latte (delicious) and I got the chocolate expresso beer (I can't remember the name of the drink, but it was divine. It went splendidly with my honey latte.) It was exactly what I woke up craving! A nice Guinness stout with expresso syrup, and shaved chocolate on top.. mmmm.  The BF got their Fillmore Shandy and a cappuccino, the shandy was delicious as well. I also ordered their veggie sandwich, which was very tasty and light.\n\nOverall, definitely going to be visiting more often. Their food was great, the bartender was friendly, and the decor was very welcoming. The food selection is pretty minimal but filling. I want to see what their wax poetic after dark events entail, it seems like a lot of fun.", "author": "T M."}

She knows how to treat her regulars right, or anyone else in off the street. They've also added a happy hour and the tacos and sliders are bomb dot com!\n\nNow that I've tried several things off the menu, I feel safe in writing a review. I live just on the next block, and I definitely agree that I'm glad I don't have to leave my hood if I just want a beer or a coffee and a low-key, but comfortable hang out. Believe me, that wasn't true when I first moved to the hood in '04.\n\nHarmony makes a great latte (not a huge Four Barrel fan, but she does right by it), and I could drink a tennis bracelet's worth of Yellow Diamonds - a sparkling winetail. If it's got bubbles, I'll drink it. I like to stop by after farmer's market on Saturdays which is perfect if I can't decide on coffee or alcohol or both. I like the oldies R&B on the turntable perfect for chillaxin' and dreaming up what I'm going to cook with my farmers' market veggies. They've usually got some nice pastries, too.\n\nI dropped by after 4p the other day to check out their cheese n charcuterie boards. For some reason, I assumed it was a sandwich, but close enough. I chose Fiscalini Cheddar (try Fiscalini Gold - great local cheese) for my Branch and Board plate. One of the meats (which I've forgotten already) would be great for a picnic if you're a bacon fan - smoky with paprika. I liked the vibe at this time.\n\nI do like the ambiance - exposed brick, dark wood bar, timeworn books atop the shelves, and a rich looking upholstered blue wall with jumpseats at two-tops.\n\nHmm ... and I was just wishing for a place where I could read a book and have a beer or maybe play a card game with a friend where my choices aren't limited to coffee and tea.\n\nI'll be looking forward to a few more menu items and a happy hour. I've got to try the sangria, and it's good to know I won't have to get behind the wheel to get home.", "author": "Myla A."}

We got to sit in the window area, which probably enhanced the evening.  They have a good selection of beers, and the ambiance was perfect for a Friday night.  \n\nThey need another bathroom.  They only have one single occupancy bathroom, and the line got long.  Curiously, the bathroom is extremely large and could probably be split into two separate rooms.  Behind me in line were 4 young women who ended up pounding on the doors screaming \"Whatever happened to chivalry?\"  Geeze, was I supposed to let FOUR women go ahead of me in the bathroom line?  That is absurd.  They expect me to be chivalrous, yet they were completely unladylike.  And let's be serious, if I had let them go ahead of me, they would have been thinking, \"OMG, this creepy guy just wants to hit on us in the bathroom line!\"  Right?  I didn't just fall off of the turnip truck yesterday.  This wasn't my first trip to the bathroom.  I've been to the bathroom a few times in my life.  \n\n I have to remove one star for the limited bathroom situation and the douchebags in the bathroom line.\n\nP.S.

I love to happen upon cool places like this.  The bartender / barista was very welcoming and kept a cool stream of music going - I kept asking, \"Hey, what is that?\"  I \"discovered\" some great new music.  LOVE.  I liked the fact that I could decide if it is coffee time or wine time ;)  (Pah Starbucks!)  The swirly cinnamon bread was warm and tasty; scones, bellissimo.  There was an eclectic smattering of people studying, reading, wandering in, meeting - purple-haired girls, old black dudes who talked scat like they just put down their smoking guitars, buttoned-down suits sitting at these crazy desks-for-one attached to the wall on their computers.  Regulars and first-timers.

Unfortunately it's comfier on the eyes than the ass, but the large tables and chair make up for the lack by providing ample room for studying.

It is not made by the cup as I assumed rather lives in a store bought plastic urn for who knows how long. My cup of joe tasted old/bitter, and I later found a bunch of sludge at the bottom and in my mouth upon final sip. For $2.50 you deserve better. \n\nINSTEAD get an expresso drink.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-06-10", "description": "I really wanted to like this place. I came here once a week for the first month that they were opened. I came in during the day, hoping to avoid any crowds or annoying drunk people. And 3 out of the 4 times I was here, the owner (I believe) brown haired girl, was okay, but she just never really made conversation. And believe me, I don't come into places wanting the conversation, but if you saw me once a week for over a month in an almost empty place, and I tried making conversation about the ipad POS system and suggesting square cardcase, that just maybe she would ask me if I lived in the neighborhood, or telling me about the bar so far. She was polite, but doesn't seem to be a natural at customer service. At least with females about her age. She did make a lot of conversation with 2 regular guys a couple of times. \n\nDespite the lackluster conversation, and the mediocre music during the day, there also is no good snack/food option before 4pm. The pastries never looked very exciting. It has such a classy/hip vibe, that I'm surprised they don't take note of some easy bar snacks like at Alembic. Good olives, upscale nuts, chips with a whipped dip. Seriously, go check out Alembic for some tips on adding some amazing food on a bar/coffee snack menu. A customer even brought her pizza one day from down the street and they both ate it right in front of me. It made me cry a little inside because I was so hungry.\n\nAlso, San Franciscans like drinking deals. I believe they have a happy hour now, but I'm talking make it really worth it. With places like $2 beers at Bean Bag Cafe, half off pizzas at Fly Bar, or the 8 million scoutmob/groupon deals in this city, clearly you need to up your game. \n\nAs others have said, the seating here isn't really designed for camping. Which is fine for a lounge night place, but during the day it is a bit painful to watch people on their computers sitting uncomfortably. \n\nI think I would start coming back here if I knew the girl wasn't working, and if they had some day specials to make it worthwhile. I like the whole concept, and I love the location, but I just never had a great experience there. I really don't see this place lasting unless they make some serious adjustments.", "author": "Courtney s."}

A better place for four barrell coffee is just a healthy walk up Fillmore at  Jane Cafe ($2 a cup with FREE refills and a fair amount of plugs for people who like to study on their laptops).  Jane also has decent food at anytime of day- for some strange reason Social Study doesn't serve real food before 4pm, just day old scones, bananas, and chocolate muffins.

But I still cannot understand the loud and jarring music playing from the speakers during day time.  I can understand the desire to be musically expressive and loud during evenings.  But why during the day time?   \n\nWhat is wrong with all these indie coffee shops?  They are like \"Let me find the most annoying, arbit and haphazard musical arrangement to portray my uniqueness, and then pipe it up to a million decibel level.  This way my customers have absolutely no way to enjoy the sip of what I am really known for or carrying some work during the peace of the day\".  \n\nMaybe I am the only one feeling like this but I surely won't come solely to enjoy coffee, do any work or study.  I am going to go back to Royal ground coffee shop, a few blocks up Fillmore.  Doesn't have the same ambience and the coffee might be just a notch lower, but the overall atmosphere is very serene and simplistic.\n\nFinally, the bartender seems to be friendly or willing to look or sound friendly only to locals, not noobs like me.\n\nIf they pipe down the day music, I will update this review.", "author": "Krish R."}

I started to smellucinate what they could possibly be serving  in this effortless cool urban bohemian looking hipster of a place in Lower Pac Heights-- Since I'm neither from Bohemia nor am I a hipster, I did want some more stiff drinks to ease out of my headache.\n\nThe Social Study, is a library-like part caf\u00e9, part lounge, part bar or part 747 cockpit sans the seat belts hangout. I didn't know whether I should have card cataloged my order first with the bartendress or  put my tray table up with my seats in an upright and locked position then find the stewardess button.\n\nSince I was sobering up, I couldn't help but stare at the communal table and the long wooden bar, or the pale-blue, studded-leather wall fold-down seats, all  while trying studiously to absorb what's written in this library like bar menu. I liked what I saw because it was diverse in category but focused on the good selections. I thought a pitcher of house made sangria might be good; but no, I wanted to drink my dessert and try the cocktail (Chocolate Factory) that had some Guinness, some shots of espresso and a smidgen of chocolate syrup; but wait, I also wanted to try some red wine like  'sexual  chocolate syrah/zin 2010' or  'cucao carmenere'; but, no, I was tempted by some whites like 'augustus viognier' or 'count karoly gruner'; but, hold on, they also had a list of winetails like 'sanfrangria', 'nojito', fillmo'sa' (proscecco and tangerine); oh, but there's a nice selection of bottled beers, from Jamaican  Red Stripe, to some local  Arrogant Bastard Ale, to Belgium's Chimay Peres Trappistes; ---at last, I decided.  I opted for some Fillmore Shandy of Schrmshaw Pilsner, house ginger and citrus.

All day and night they play old skool soul and hip-hop. My nickname for SS is \"Cafe Shazaam\" because that's the app I'm always pulling out to ID the old skool joints that I here when I'm there. Could it have a few more outlets, sure. But I just bring a splitter and extension cord and I'm fine. It's a very unique place and definitely worth at least checking out the next time you're in the Fillmore.", "author": "Eric W."}

I, and most, like hot coffee.  The coffee was good otherwise.\nHowever, like a lot of new coffee bars, the place is trying  to be condiment hip.  Stevia is NOT a good sugar substitute - not sweet and leaves a metallic aftertaste.  Why not blue or pink packets?  Where is whole milk, or even 1/2 & 1/2?  Soy milk and lo-fat milk only.  Let me decide for myself what I like in my coffee.\nAnd the coffee is expensive:  $2.50 for a small.  It is not THAT good.  The entire package for a coffee drinker is not appealing.  \nThe atmosphere/environment is nice.  Especially if one is not drinking coffee  ha ha.  Better for the wine/beer crowd later.\nWindows were dirty (noticeable since the entire front is window - which is nice) and many cob webs above.  \nI'll go back one more time in a few weeks.  I think this place might make it with the wine/beer.  But it is not a coffee destination, and to attract morning coffee drinkers, it needs to be a destination since it is out of the way. I hope they make it.", "author": "Bob M."}

The ordering process is a total chaos. Bartender was very rude and not attentive. The only good thing about this place is the ambiance..", "author": "Jan K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-01", "description": "Social Study is my favorite place in the Fillmore for a latte Monday through Friday- the coffee is delicious and Harmony the owner and her staff are the best. I found out this weekend that it is also the best spot in the Fillmore for a party- the drinks are fantastic, the food is really really tasty, and the atmosphere is ideal for hanging out with a group of friends. Social Study is stylish, intimate and comfortable all at once and your guests won't want to leave! The best!", "author": "Alexandra M."}
