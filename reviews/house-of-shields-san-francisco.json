Very sturdy old architecture and it's dark and gloomy and miserable like the rest of San Francisco.\n\nFor a Saturday night, I played tourist to the city I grew up in.  A couple of friends and myself walk about SF bar hopping.  As a tourist, bar hopping in San Francisco is quite fun.  I hate the city because parking, traffic and the people suck.  But on weekends, if you do not have to worry about driving, walking about downtown, chinatown, North Beach and even Aquatic Park can be fun.  We started by watching a 1pm Giants vs Dodgers Game, then, checked into our hotel on the South of Market, went to at least 7 or 8 bars and finished here where we mellowed out with a perfect gin and tonic.\n\nThe darkness inside here is true San Francisco.  Bar hop and make this your last check in.  It's like walking into a morgue.", "author": "Tony U."}

Tons of people crammed in front of the bar while staff tried to finagle through the sea of people while breaking glasses and pushing patrons to the side.  \n\nThere was hardly any place to stand but we lucked out and took a table from a few people who were leaving shortly after we arrived. \n\nI ordered their pimm's cup and it was well made. My complaint is how long it took to make since there was only one bartender and about thirty people trying to order drinks/waiting for their order at the bar. There should've been at least two people downstairs. \n\nWith all variables considered I wouldn't recommend this place if this is how it is during a peak time in SF. \n\nNot a atmosphere that's very relaxing after a long day of work. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back to this place.", "author": "Ashley L."}

I've been here for many-a work events, discussions with clients over drinks, and just with friends after work for Happy Hour. The bartenders are nice, the drinks are strong, and the space is classy...but the crowd is always a blast. Nothing is uptight here, just come and enjoy.\n\nIf you can snag a seat at the bar I'd say go for it, but expect a crowd and the booths go fast too. It's narrow between the bar and the booths, but squeeze your way to the back for a little more open space. Wait your turn for drinks, they will come and I've never seen the folks here not hustle. Upstairs is a nice private event area and I've attended a few up there. It's a tad dark and musky, that's the vibe of this high class dive. Their pour a great pint of guinness, the moscow mules are good, the old fashioned is solid and a personal favorite of mine is a Negroni with Hendricks. These guys do it right with a twist of orange rind.  Their signature cocktails are good too, I can't recall any names as I'm more of an old-fashioned or negroni guy, but every one I've had here I've liked. \n\nAlso, please stop complaining about it being packed. They cannot magically double in size, they have no control over the serious lack of good bars in SOMA and let's not confuse that with consistently good drinks and service. My advice, if you can get off a tad early, hit them at 430-5pm and you'll be fine, if not, suck is up or go somewhere else.", "author": "Nate E."}

A small lounge space upstairs. A weird giant urinal. You know. The works. \n\nPrices are not absurd. It gets a little packed at peak times, but not SUPER packed. There's plenty of seating. I'd complain that it gets hard to hear other people talk when it's super busy, but... C'mon. It's the Financial District. It's going to get jammed with people at 6pm and they're going to have conversations and it's gonna get noisy. \n\nThe Smoke Stack is a pretty good cocktail.

The inside is delightful! The ambient lighting and cozy booth seats make this bar not only classic but so dreamy! We enjoyed a couple of martinis here and were thrilled with the service and the care and detail that went into making our cocktails. I love that (unlike your average bars in San Francisco, or anywhere else for that matter) this bar did not have TVs plastered all over the walls. What a nice treat from those loud bars where some kind of game or tv show is always streaming! I feel like my boyfriend and I enjoyed our time together as it was intended, without distractions. What a special time here! As a matter of fact, we lost so much track of time sitting in here sharing our drinks and some laughs that I almost felt like I was in Las Vegas where there is no concept of night and day until you stroll out of those casinos and realize it's the next day!

The vibe of the space is a little odd - a place that hearkens back to a previous, simpler time where boozing was done in secret and illegally, but falls short of the charm of some of the other speakeasies in the city.\n\nIt certainly has classic drinks like moscow mules in copper cups, and a pretty good old fashioned.  The thing that irks me a bit about this place though, is that sometimes I can feel slighted by the service, like when I tried to order two old fashioned and it took 15 mins to get them!  I know drinks can take a while, and I know I should be more patient, but the drink is also $12!\n\nI expect to have to wait at Zeitgeist, and I expect to be intentionally demoralized there when I go to order, but I think the classic watering hole should have a slightly higher bar for service!", "author": "Alex H."}

The bar itself is spectacular. The woodwork is incredible and from what I understand, it's original to the building? Not totally sure but definitely worth checking out.\n\nThe back bar was small and the spirits selection was somewhat limited. I like scotch though and without being too picky, there were a number of scotches to be had. The cocktails were also great and my friends and I enjoyed a few hours here hanging out and catching up. I'd definitely pop back in for another drink if I'm in the area. Not really a destination bar for me... As in I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but it's pretty close to my office so odds are I'll be there again soon enough.\n\nThe doorman was extremely kind and forgiving when a friend of mine was a little too tipsy.

Walked in and I thought it was kinda narrow and dark, but the positives were sloooowly revealed.\n\nI mingled a little first, not knowing what I wanted to drink. I went up to the bar and hovered while the bartender made someone else's drinks, hoping for a suggestion or a drink choice to come to mind. \n\nThen it was my turn. So much pressure, I still didn't know what I wanted, but I didn't want to miss out, so I asked for something pisco-y, since that's what I drank last. He, Patrick, the bartender, made me a pisco capa-something, a different version of a mojito. It was great, and it was about 6x as much drink (basically a full pint glass) as the last bar for almost half the price ($8). There's muddled lime in it, which I was worried about. I don't normally like alcohol with lime, but the taste was very subtle it didn't bother me. I must have really sold it too, because I got someone else to order one... AND that person even bought me a second. Score.\n\nPatrick, the bartender, was awesome. He played punk rock music, he dealt with our huuuge group all by himself (Seriously the only other guy working there was the bouncer, but don't get the wrong idea about the place... not a club.) He's a man wearing many hats: bartender, musician, engineer, and historian? It's true, he told me the bar - this beautiful tall, wooden, antique-y thing, from what I remember through beer-goggles - was about 105 years old. Gorgeous. Check out the picture of the dudes on the wall, too. In addition, I used the bathroom and felt like I 100% stepped into Downton Abbey maids quarters. I kinda didn't want to leave.\n\nBadass bar that I'd totally return to for being the kinda place I'd want everyone to know my name.

Years ago, I used to come here often with business associates and spend the afternoon drinking far more than I should on a weekday.  But, that's the purpose of House of Shields and we weren't alone.\n\nAfter all these years, the only thing that's changed in the bar is that it's cleaner than it used to be.  I don't mean that it was dirty because they didn't sweep the floors, but the walls and ceilings were coated with years and years of smoking (when they allowed it) and the general dirt that wafts through the air of a small, dark city bar.  When the new owners took over a few years back they cleaned the place from head to toe and now it sparkles with a sheen it hasn't seen in many moons.\n\nThey have a few special drinks that will tickle your taste buds, but Hubby's favorite is this drink with ginger beer that's served up in one of their special mugs.  As always, I drink red wine which is good enough quality for picky me and served in a glass that reminded me of a mason jar.  Charming!\n\nSo if you're looking for a nice place to have a few drinks that's not one of those chain bars or a chi-chi corner pub, House of Shields serves up good people and good drinks.", "author": "VB L."}

In a city where owners spend millions on remodels to make a new breed of bar and then pretend depserately that they're not trying, House of Shields is quite the opposite. Architecturally, it's in kind of a gorgeous space and has the bones to be a really swank spot. But that's just because of who they are and who they've always been. And when it comes to trying, well... they're just not *trying* to be anything other than a bar that pours you drinks.\n\nWere it me, I'd probably fall into the trap of adopting a gimmick. Go with the history of the place. Or the old school sipping lounge. Or dive bar. Or one of countless other things that bars try desperately to be known for without revealing that they're trying to be known for it. But kudos to the HOS peeps who just let the chips fall where they may and serve drinks.\n\nThis is not to say that they don't have a reputation or a feel. Every bar has a vibe, and theirs is an after work hangout to grab drinks with friends. Slide into the tall, deep booths and get a quick whet for your whistle or sit up at the long, classic bar and let the fella there take care of you. (Perhaps there's ladies too.. I dunno. It was a fella when I went.)\n\nI didn't see any of the infamous bike messengers that Yelp tells me the place is known for. Or too many suits from Financial District folks headed home.

There really isn't much of one. Don't mistake that, though. Come on a Friday or Saturday and it's as packed as many SF bars, but on a weekday, you'll find a fair amount of collars along with a sprinkle of women. \n\nThat crowd leads to the second good weekday bar quality, the ability to carry a conversation without needing to expose any of the veins in your head. The music is varied in genre, never bad, and presented at a level to create a landscape or theme to conversation. Which is nice because it allows for the opportunity to engage with the people around you, friends, strangers, and bartenders alike. \n\nHence, the third quality; an unpretentious, familiar ease. The decor of the bar establishes its presence with its vintage, grand decor but doesn't upstage the activity it invites within.  Rather, it frames it, making even any inebriated patron look stately. And this unpretentious, familiar ease extends to the bartenders as well. Not only can they make solid drinks (in particular, Shanti and Eric), raising conversation and introductions come as free-flowing and tasty. \n\nA real gem of a weekday bar.", "author": "Shirley T."}

In recent years, I've stayed closer to the Embarcadero so it's been awhile since I last had a drink at HoS.\n\nWell, this past weekend, I made a return trip to HoS and it was my first trip since their remodel. The decor is pretty much the same, they seemed to clean things up and made a few minor cosmetic changes behind the bar.\n\nIn the past, they use to have live DJ's on the second floor balcony, and it served as  a \"venue\" on Friday and Saturday nights. Those days are over, from what some of the regulars told me, the owners wanted to \"class\" things up and get rid of the Art Academy crowd, so the live music stuff is doneski. Which is fine with me, I kinda liked the new setup, and the drinks were great. The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve. \n\nWhen I arrived at 8:30 p.m., only a few of use were there, but things quickly picked up at around 10 p.m. and it was pretty much standing room only. \n\nI plan on returning here when I visit San Francisco next month.", "author": "Henry F."}

I've noticed that it gets packed right after work and then is totally dead in the later hours. So, if you're headed there after work your best bet is to show up early and snag a booth. I recommend the seating upstairs if you have a bit of a larger group but your group will have to go back down to the bar for drinks again (which can kind of be a good thing if you're footing the bill). I recommend their specialty, the Moscow Mule, but be forewarned that you'll have to let them hang on to your ID so that you don't steal their coveted mugs.

They'll tell you the sordid history of this place if you ask, and all while mixing a mean drink.

We were able to get a seat at the bar, although there were plenty of little dimly lit booths too. \n\nIt was one of our girls' birthdays, and turned out one of the bartenders, too, so he made us up a tasty celebratory shot.

They checked on us often enough, and were handy for drink suggestions as well. I like my drinks to be delicious (or one might say girly), and this is kind of a no-frills place. You won't find anything fancy in a martini glass here except for maybe a dry gin martini. So, on one's recommendation, I tried a Greyhound, which wouldn't have sounded good, except he said it would be made with St. Germaine's vodka. I hadn't tried St. Germaine's, but I thought, why not ... so glad I did! My drink, topped with a garnish of three black cherries, really hit the spot. So much so that I opted for my next drink to be the same, and my husband gave it a try as well. \n\nThat Greyhound was so yummy I've been thinking about it ever since, and plan to revisit soon. \n\nI really liked the atmosphere.

I remembered that House of Shields had just reopened and so I tearily ambled down Market Street to drown my sorrows.\n\nI sit down and ask what kind of beers on tap- un-smiing bartender begins rambling off a list- not even looking in my direction.Halfway through the list- I say, \"Trumer please.\" He continues to ramble all the names- i again say, \"Trumer\"- He brings me back a beer with a lemon in it. I say,\"That's not a Trumer.\"- He acts like it's my fault and without apology says, \"I thought you said Wedmer\"...and brings me back a Trumer. Five bucks. I pay, I tip. He mumbles something about a slow night. Drink. Ponder movie. He asks me if I want another beer. I say, \"In a minute.\" I think,\" Hmm, something stronger.\" I ask what's a great drink- he suggests a gin drink- I say no, make me a Manhattan. Brings it. Damn good cocktail. \n\nI start up a conversation with nice gentleman. He offers to buy me another drink- I say sure and he orders one for himself.. Another Manhattan shows up- great cocktail. We talk, totally pleasant conversation. I go out to smoke- and as I'm coming back in my new friend and I have decided to go our separate ways- my friend says, the bartender is worried you are not going to pay your bill. I said, \"Yes I'm going back in.\" I go back in and the bartender tells me my Manhattan is $18.00. I don't argue- I pay. I think,\"Fuck, that's crazy.\"- \n\nI texted my friend this morning- apologizing for the expensive drink he bought me. He replies, \"No I paid $18.00 for both our drinks...\" I realize that the bartender is not only unfriendly, a poor listener, lacks social skills, is either really bad at math- or a rip off artist- thinking I would never apologize to the guy the next day for buying me such an expensive drink....either way- it doesn't bode well with me. I rarely write a negative review of any business.\n\nLove the bar- it's always been glorious-but the service is absolute shite. \n\nGet someone who wants to be there. Period. One, when a woman comes into a bar alone, be nice to her. Period. Bartenders should have an ease about him. This guy was not that...even my new friends mentioned what a bad vibe he had from the minute they walked in. Bartending is a combined art of mixology, class, and personality and this place deserves just that. \n\nHe might want to think about why it was a slow night..Maybe it is him.\nI will go back-it's too lovely of a spot not to- but I will be very careful to pay my drinks when I get them.", "author": "jules m."}

Yup, it was used for sneaking the hooch over to the hotel.\n\nYou will get your dose of messengers, iron workers, business folks, art students, etc here.  You will also get a chance to order from a full bar with a good beer selection.  I don't know crap about wine, so you're on your own if you want to know about their selection.  \n\nI LOVE the old handmade aspect of most of the fixtures in the room.  Things were made with a lot more elbow grease in those days.  Many of the tiles on the floor seem to be slightly crooked, or at that's what they look like after a martini or so.

But oh man, I was surprised when I got there.\n\nI guess it's not just me who experienced the WORST bar tending service last night (Tuesday, 8/5/08). I thought the woman bartender just hated our group. My guy friend bought the first round. When he came to get a second round, he was completely ignored for 30+ mins. The bar wasn't too crowded and he made eye contact with her several times. She would serve other people who didn't even need a drink and completely ignored my friend. Eventually, he finally got the round. For the third round, he waited again...and waited...and waited. He tried going down to the other side of the bar, but he waited again...and waited...and waited.\n\nHe came back to our table discouraged. We joked about how he needed to show some skin to get better service. We wanted some beers, so I tried my hand at it. I went up to the bar and waited. She made eye contact with me. She served a few people that were before me and then ignored me for a while. Weird, but I can understand it. Eventually, I started to say something and she came up to me holding a stack of used glasses. One of them broke which she threw in the trash. A loud sound but nothing startling. The guy next to me, on the computer, didn't even seem phased. Instead of asking me what I wanted, she started flirting with the guy on the computer! \"I didn't mean to startle you,\" she said as she continued smiling. She tried to continue the conversation, but he was more interested in his computer screen that what she was saying. Eventually, I said to her that I'd like to order 3 beers. \n\nShe poured them. Then went to the other side of the bar and helped a group with about six drinks while ours waited by the tap. Then she helped another group with their drinks while our drinks were just sitting on the other counter waiting to be picked up. Eventually after serving two parties that came after me, she brought the drinks over. I told her to put it on my friend's tab and apparently, my friend noticed her give me a dirty look when I said that. \n\nLuckily for me, that was our last round. I can't deal with terrible service when it's unnecessary. I definitely would avoid this woman bartender (short brown hair and pale skin) if I came back. This place does have some memories for me - I always run into my friend I hardly see every time I come, which is almost never. By the way, the music alone was so bad that I wanted to line dance out of there. Yes, LINE DANCE. I think if someone wanted to go here, they'd have to drag me there and pay for all my drinks.

Large groups are the WORST.  Ordering fancy cocktails rather than sticking to beer, wine, and simple drinks (when a bar is crowded.. please don't ask them for a -tini cocktail or a margarita. Stick to the basics.) \n\n- Regular customers (who leave decent tips) are a bartender's bread and butter and they will always trump all other customers. They'll get drinks faster and get waited on first.  \n\n- Perhaps someone in your group was snotty to her, and indicated that there would be a very small (or no) tip.  I waited tables and bartended for years.. and there's nothing more frustrating than a large, high maintenance group who makes it pretty clear right from the start that they're going to give you a shitty tip. \n\n-  And really.. if you leave zero tip on a 200.00 tab, expect to get cursed at, and possibly have something thrown in your direction.  \n\nAnd yes.

A haven for the all walks of life to meet and and socialize and enjoy the company of down to earth people not concerned about the superficial. A place where day and night were no different and one could escape the hustle and bustle of the world outside in a house that shielded them from that very place.  \n\nThe new place, while pretty and clean, is now a shadow of the soul of San Francisco that it once was. It has been remade into another trendy bar and catering to a trendy and superficial crowd more concerned with image than content. Prices have gone up about 60% and the selection has gone down. \n\nIt now feels artificial and plastic and like a new car attempting to be classic. The speakeasy feel has been wiped clean. Like Hollywood bastardizing a classic movie with another remake. Its been wiped of the spirit and much of the history that had been ingrained in the 100+ years that it has been in existence. \n\nIts too bright, the windows are open, velvet red curtains replaced by mini-blinds. I can see the world outside that a person would once come in to leave behind for a few wonderful hours in that once glorious hole.  Time no longer stands still inside. \n\nThe crowd its currently attracting seems like a carbon copy of itself, people who would be seen at Rye or Absinthe.

I prefer bars to clubs, but I've been working too late to go to happy hours downtown. Last Friday, a friend decided she needed a drink, and I decided I needed a break.\n\nWe ended up here by accident; the rain forced us into somewhere close, and you can see the sign outside from a half a block away. It definitely has a pub-like feel, with dark wood and booths. It's much smaller than the Bank of Ireland, and it wasn't too crowded on a Friday night. We were able to get seats at the bar right away.\n\nThe blustery weather suggested that whiskey was the way to go, and HOS serves Powers Irish Whiskey. Most bars in the City (and everywhere) stock Jamesons and Bushmills. They're sort of the Coke and Pepsi of Irish whiskeys (provided that drinking a Coke let everyone know you're Catholic). I guess that makes Powers the RC Cola of whiskey. Anyway, they have the whiskey I like, so I'm adding a star for that.\n\nOur bartender took our order straightaway. My friend was feeling rather frisky, and decided to steal olives out of the condiment holders behind the bar. This pretty much destroyed the bartender-patron relationship. When she was unable to make my friend a proper sidecar (which from reading the reviews is an apparent problem), we decided to head elsewhere.\n\nThis place has potential, or maybe its best days are behind it.

So introduce she did.\n\nUpon walking in, we encountered several bicycles -- and bicycle messengers saddled up at the bar. Rule of thumb: If bicycle messengers frequent a bar, chances are good that it's a good place -- and that the bartenders are good people. So the first impression was solid.\n\nGiven the history of the place -- and the fact that I'm a history geek -- I was intrigued by the bar's long run, the large urinal in the bathroom, the original tile work on the floor, and the lore of the tunnels beneath. Usually when I'm in San Francisco, I hang out at the Buddha Bar in Chinatown (which, if http://www.yelp.com/biz/51gscyjxkVari5gK3qIsTA is any indication, has changed immensely since I used to frequent the joint; what happened to the aging woman tending bar? The Chinese soap operas on the TV? The scarcity of non-Chinese?) -- and it, too, is rumored to have tunnels underground. Like bike messengers, tunnels beneath bars are a good thing.\n\nWe took a two-top on the side, and I ordered an Anchor Steam and a sparkling water with lemon. Total? $4 plus tip. Nice. While we hung out for two hours catching up and hanging out, the messengers left, more people came in -- claiming the larger booth beneath the loft-stage area -- and the volume increased, largely because some idlers at the bar got progressively drinky and thinky. But the place never got packed. Nish, you might enjoy it after 7:30 on a weekday.\n\nThe place is a little too clean for me -- and the ceilings perhaps a little too high (although there are indications that there used to be a suspended ceiling; I honestly can't picture that) -- for it to sing frequency to me, but I can see the House of Shields as a pleasant occasional watering hole. (It's also in a weird neighborhood for a solid local; in fact, it feels like a local waiting to happen.)\n\nKudos to all involved.", "author": "Heath R."}

Harding died in the House of Shields. His addiction to pussy and alcohol is tantamount to his signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and on a warm night in August 1923, the booze finally did him in. His wingmen found him upstairs, face down dead, surrounded by panicked prostitutes. Public knowledge of his rather shameful demise was of course out of the question (it is not statesmanlike to drink oneself to death during Prohibition while fucking hookers), so his two brave associates carried him through the tunnel which connects the House of Shields to the Palace Hotel under New Montgomery St. and escorted the corpse back to his room, claiming fatigue from his recent train trip from Seattle. I imagine this as the Jazz Age version of Weekend at Bernie's.\n\nEager to verify this tale, my colleague and I performed a quiet search for the tunnel, and I can confirm its existence. However, the exit point is behind the front desk at the Palace Hotel, and unless you can think on your feet faster than I can, I advise you come up with a reason for being there before starting your subterranean journey (look for my one-star review of the Palace Hotel's security staff in the coming months [hi, Gary!]) I don't want to ruin the adventure by telling you where the tunnel begins, but your first step will be in the ladies' room.\n\nThis bar must be saved, if purely for historical reasons.

I am not.). \nThe trouble is this: The bartenders (on our last trip, at least) blew chunks. Like really. They BLEW. At one point, one of them had been talking to (showing her boobs to) a guy for about 5 minutes to the exclusion of everyone waiting for a drink. This is one BIG bar. There are lots of thirsty people. Lisa and I finally asked the dude she was desperately showing her tits to if HE would buy us a drink, since she didn't seem concerned with helping US. He agreed. This is how we got our drinks. Oh, please...Then it happened again when I went back for another round. Except this time, it was another dude and she was flipping her hair around like she was posessed.  It was really annoying. And sad.\nHOS is a great place for large groups and there are usually plenty of cute boys with which to occupy one's self. If you're a girl, chances are good you'll get plenty of free drinks.

Actually, I was there that night (as well as many nights ... HOS is one of my favorite bars in the city). The bartender was not fired, she had already given notice and was moving on to bigger and better things (she said afterwards). I think one too many prissy as$ yuppie customers ordering expensive drinks and being cheap with the tip pushed her over the edge. That bar was packed full that night and she was the only one there (great owner eh? real professional....saving a few minimum wage hours while causing employees to bust their asses). The yelp crew was prissy, yuppyish, pretentious, and obviously out of place. If you didn't like the service, why did you stay and run up a 200$ tab? Why not just go to any of the bars within 1/2 block that are more friendly to your snotty ilk? They are not understaffed and over worked and there would be some other prissy yuppy there to wait on you hand and foot. But no, you stayed, ordered 200$ worth of drinks, all the while planning your little purile revenge by stiffing a minimum wage worker who was serving 200+ people solo out of her sole source of income. You suck and you're exactly what I suspected yelp employees to be like. I also work around the corner and request that you stay out of my bar...better experience for everyone...no I am not the bartender and I don't know her, but I did witness the event and as someone who used to have to serve shallow self-entitled customers while I worked my way through college, I completely understand her bitter rage. She was near tears when you left ... jerks. Hope you had a good sense of satisfaction.", "author": "jojo b."}
