I've never had Senegalese food before, but I'm glad I found this place.\n\nMy friend and I got the fried plantain appetizer (sorry, can't remember the name). It came with a yogurt dipping sauce. I normally do not like plantains, but this stuff was GOOOOD. I wanted to eat the whole plate to myself but of course, sharing is caring. \n\nFor my main dish, I got the Risa Au Cari with chicken which came with red curry, potatoes, carrots, etc. I got it with rice but next time I'm going to try couscous instead. The curry was not too thick and not too watery, which I like! The flavor was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and fell off the bone when I tried to separate the meat and the bone with my fork.\n\nI can't wait to try the rest of their dishes next time!", "author": "Julian Y."}

There is a first for everything... it was such a HIT.\n\n- FOOD, amazingly good\n- PRICES, affordable\n- SERVICE, fast\n- AMBIANCE, reminds me of a Caribbean place but not really\n\nWhere do I begin?\nI've always wondered about this place. It is a \"hipster\" joint BUT IT IS A VERY WORTHY HIPSTER JOINT. Every Tuesday night there is something happening and this evening they had dancing and drumming. Place gets very packed and we got a table. Great menu, alcoholic drinks are cheaper then regular drinks, and there's happy hour specials on the food. \n\nHEFER STATS.\n\nWe stayed with the happy hour food special (1 cocktail, 1 appetizer, and 1 main dish) for $20... worth it and you will be leaving STUFFED. Check-in with yelp and you get free Aloko.\n\n(1) ALOKO - Ripe plantains fried to perfection and served with our handmade tamarind yogurt dipping sauce. This was pretty good, that handmade tamarind sauce put the good sweet factor on top of the plantains.\n\n(2) BAOBAB GAMBAS - Sauteed prawns marinated in garlic and cayenne pepper, served in a red curry with pita bread. CRACKING!!! OMG SO GOOD!!! It came with pieces of flatbread. If you think chachacha's gambas are good, you really have no idea about Baobab Gambas. One of the best gambas I've ever had. I couldn't get enough of this. I like to call this GAMBAS IN CRACK SAUCE, so addicting and delicious. We wrapped up dinner a couple hours ago and I'm still sprung on it.\n\n(3) MAFE - Chicken, sauteed mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and spinach served in a curry peanut sauce. This was very nice. The chicken was fall off the bone good and the sauce reminded me of a Filipino dish called KareKare. It had a nice peanut flavor, at first the heat isn't there but after half way you will start to feel some heat. ITS SO GOOD!!!! \n\n(4) TATU - hibiscus margarita. Nothing margarita about this drink at all. It tasted like spiked hibiscus juice!!!! \n\n(5) PITCHER OF SORANGE - i think thats the drink. We shared a pitcher, enjoyed each others company, and some music. I think i like this drink better then the Tatu.\n\nAfter dinner we were able to watch the performances of drummers and dancers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-01", "description": "Senegal.\n\nWell, we all know how my geography is. I thought Cancun was in the United States so naturally, I thought Senegal was in Spain. Why? Because \"Senegal, Spain\" had a nice ring to it. I then remember that I confused that with Portugal.\n\nUmm yah, I wouldn't last a day much less a round on the Amazing Race. =/\n\nAnyhow, Senegalese cuisine is like Afro-Caribbean cuisine; where most meat and veggies dishes are stewed then poured over rice or couscous. Bissap Baobab and Little Baobab are the only restaurants in SF that serve Senegalese cuisine. They're actually two places in one as Bassip Baobab (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bissap-baobab-san-francisco) is inside Little Baobab. Both serve the same food but Bassip has late night live music performances while Little Baobab turns into a club after dinner.\n\nLittle Baobab is one funky place; it's divey, loud, hot, and kitschy. Not an ideal place to bring a date because there's just too much going on (i.e annoying flashing lights) that it's distracting to even maintain a convo, however, it's a cool place to check out once as it showcases the vast diversity of the city. \n\nLittle Baobab offers numerous deals. From their everyday happy hour menu: http://bit.ly/17xI6Yj and 1 app, 1 entr\u00e9e, and 1 house cocktail for $20 before 7 pm to their 30% off your entire dinner bill (including drinks) if you book a reservation on Savored.com. Looks like they also have a Yelp deal and my friend told me they have a Bloomspot deal as well. Make sure to take advantage of these if you come. Had it not been for the Savored.com deal, this would be a 2 star review. As a a side note, there seems to be a lot of sketchy 5 star reviews. \n\nOverall the food and drinks were about 3.5. The much raved about Tatu: Hibiscus Margarita ($7): http://bit.ly/1038Auk was way too strong but the Coconut Infused Rum ($7): http://bit.ly/18cPXvv was deliciously creamy. If it wasn't a Sunday night, I would have gotten a pitcher all for myself. \n\nThe Avocat Creole ($8.75): http://bit.ly/130czNG was canned tuna with spicy mayo NOT crab (they should update their menu to reflect this since some people are allergic to fish). The accompanying yucca fries were hard and stale. I would skip this app. For my entr\u00e9e, I order the Mafe w/ Chicken in a Peanut Sauce & Couscous ($11.75): http://bit.ly/11VI8qM which was delicious. The chicken drumsticks were stewed to a fall-off-the-bone tenderness with a decadently creamy peanut sauce that I slathered all over the couscous before devouring. It was one satisfying dish. \n\nService was a whole other story though. \n\nFor a 15 year old restaurant, they sure operate like a rookie. Service was like watching paint dry on the wall.\n\n6:50 pm: Arrived for our 7 pm reservations.\n6:55 pm: Ordered drinks.\n7:10 pm: Ordered one appetizer while waiting for our friend to arrive.\n7:15 pm: Ordered two more appetizers and entrees.\n7:35 pm: Asked waitress for an update on our apps.\n7:45 pm: After a 35 min wait, the wrong app was brought (ordered yucca fries but received chips and guacamole).\n7:55 pm: Second app (Avocat Creole) arrived and we ask what happened to the third app.\n8:05 pm: We were told they ran out of shrimp which was why they couldn't make the third app. It took 50 minutes to figure out they ran out of shrimp?!?\n8:06 pm: Entrees arrived 50 minutes after ordering. \n\nMost of the dishes are stews which means its pre-made or at least semi pre-made so it should NOT take 50 minutes to get your food....on a Sunday night...at a less than half full restaurant. \n\nOur waitress was super sweet and apologetic about the wait and comped the apps (thank you). We later found out it was her first day so we can't fault her. Instead, the owner/manager who was making cocktails for his friends at the bar should have been overseeing his staff especially new wait staff. Instead of socializing, he could of helped the kitchen and waitresses to ensure the food arrives to customers before the paint on the walls dry.\n\nA good restaurant doesn't need to offer deals to attract business especially not simultaneous deals. Although dinner was cheap with the Savored.com deal, you get what you pay for at Little Baobab. A lot of wasted time.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

For the past four years, Little Baobab was my absolute favorite place to go dancing in the city. It had an amazing vibe: good Caribbean/African music, chill people looking to dance without inhibitions, People of Color (POC) having drinks and enjoying the night in community.... but the scene is no longer that way. \n\nMy past few visits have made me realize that the Little Baobab I knew and loved no longer exists; it has become a victim of it's own success. Little Boabab has become extremely crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. They've expanded the venue and it is still bursting at the seams; there is simply no space to move around. The crowd has changed as well. Last night as I was struggling to dance without getting hit, I saw that the majority of people dancing with clueless vigor were mostly white hipsters and yuppies. The usually energetic African and Black dancers were standing to the sides just watching, maybe they were feeling what I was feeling: displaced in my favorite spot in the city. \n\nThe vibe has changed. No longer is it a small, familiar, and safe place for a night of dancing and flirtation. Girls were getting catty in the line for the bathroom and the bartenders looked stressed out. Usually ones to close the night out at Little Baobab, we left early last night, disappointed. \n\nIf you want taste of the Little Baobab of the past, head over to the new and still cozy/genuine Baobab in Oakland before the masses find it and turn it into a mainstream club as well.", "author": "Krithika H."}

I enjoyed every dish and can't wait to come back for more.\n\nAloko is their fried plantain. The description says it's served with a yogurt  sauce but I thought it's more like a vinaigrette. I preferred a heavier yogurt base in the sauce, but still good. \n\nPastellas with beef: Carbs and Protein are my absolute favorite! This reminded me of an empanada except it's served in a sauce which was delicious.\n\nBaobab Gambas: Shrimp in red curry  sauced served with pita bread. I am so happy they have this dish. All I needed was a scoop of rice and a spoon.\n\nMy favorite dish here is the Seafood CoCo with Talapia. The Talapia is skewered on a bamboo stick, seared to perfection and served in a coconut curry sauce with rice. BOMB! My fianc\u00e9 couldn't stop pointing at the dish with his fork after each bite. The rice is a bit dry so make sure you mix it into the curry to soak up that flavor.\n\nWe also ordered the Chicken Mafe. Its drumsticks braised in a peanut based curry sauce. The chicken was soft and fell off the bone. The description says peanut curry, so expect a very strong peanut base. I don't mind peanuts, but this was a bit much for me.\n\nThe hibiscus juice was a popular item on yelp so we ordered a regular hibiscus and ginger hibiscus. It was refreshing, but not worth the $3.50 price tag.\n\nLastly we had the Thiakry for dessert. I didn't like this.

But...it's a little over-rated. \n\nSome of my most fun & interesting friends are Baobab devotees. They praise the laid-back, unpretentious, multi-cultural vibe. They swear by the sweaty, bass-heavy dance floor sessions and the cheap tropical drinks. It all sounds so promising. \n\nWe checked it out on a Friday night, but were disappointed that the \"world music\" Baobab prides itself on, was really just a DJ. There were no actual musicians or instruments. It was just like any other club, only the DJ was playing some very un-danceable Latin music. I LOVE Reggaeton, but on this particular night, the music was just off. We felt old, and too sober. \n\nBut, the coconut-rum cocktail was SO amazing (and worth a 2nd round at just $7), I'm tempted to return just for that. There's a dude making crepes in the front of the club, and has his own little dance party going on behind the counter. The cover is $5 for girls, $10 for guys, and the male:female ratio was pretty 50/50, despite the unfair price difference. \n\nIt's totally A-OK: not douchey, very casual, and has potential for fun depending on your mood & level of intoxication.

Apparently they've expanded in the last few years. Decor is very \"worldly\". Here's a timeline of the night's progression:\n\n~10pm - $5 cover. It's sparsely populated, a good African-sounding music going. Not many people dancing, mostly standing around and chatting. Easy to get to the bar - get their ginger cocktail - DELICIOUS! Plenty of room for my group to take liberty with the space and start dancing. Line for the TWO single bathrooms already long. I say: risk breaking the seal - go to the bathroom now before the line gets worse!!\n\n~11pm - getting more crowded. Music definitely more top-40-esque. Get your drinks now - it's much more crowded up at the bar!\n\n~midnight - the place is packed. It's HOT - like muggy, stuffy, not. Either bring a fan or grab one of those laminated dinner menus that might still be sitting around because you'll need it. Music - definitely Top 40s now, but they have a guy banging on an African drum so I guess that makes it like African music? Doesn't seem quite authentic but the music's still upbeat and fun to dance to. A few circles form around some good dancers.\n\n~12:30am - I am old and lame and decide to walk the few blocks home. Given me a few years back and I would've stayed til closing - it honestly was a good time there - but I was just damn tired. My ears are ringing on the way back the music was so loud. \n\nI'll be back, for sure! To try their food too.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

They're always friendly (though sometimes I feel they could use more help) and they chat if you seem open to it and the place isn't too packed. \n\nOne of the best things? Little Baoab turns into a dance hall at night, and the music is lively. I went on a dinner date once here, and found myself being pulled into the dance floor by my boyfriend who rarely dances.

Educate yourself, people. \n\nAnyways, went for the club night last night. I was hesitant at first because the guy who invited me made it sound like it was an african drumming place or something, like it was just performances going on. While I am all for watching performances, it's Friday night and I wanna get crunk! I wanted to dance club-style with dim lights lol so I'm glad I discovered that the guy just didn't really know what he was talking about (he's not black hahaha).\n\nGood mix of reggae, dancehall, and other African music. I am all for the top 40-ish being mixed in. Top 40 is top 40 for a reason, I for one like hearing popular songs that are played on the radio played in the club. I don't like having to dance in the car only to good hits. That's the thing I hate about most SF clubs; too much EDM, electro and mash-ups when all I really wanna do is twerk like they do in videos! \n\nApparently it's $10 after midnight?

Fuck that.\n\nI've actually been here for the restaurant AND the \"club\" part afterwards. \n\nThe space is TINY, but the music and people make up for it. \n\nThe cover is usually around $3-$6\n\nLet's be honest - it's mostly music I have never heard of, but I'm cool with that. You can't NOT dance here. The music really moves you, and I am not much of a dancer. \n\nI love their drinks. They have drinks with tamarind, pomegranate and other fruits that you don't usually see. Best part - they're cheap. I average about $6 per drink here (as opposed to $10 at most places I go to).\n\nIt gets hot as hell in there and it cracks me up when people rush over to the fans. \n\nThe people are there to dance. While most places have smarmy guys hitting on anything with a pulse I have to say that when I have been there they guys really just wanted to dance and were pretty respectful. \n\nThere's nothing fancy about this place but it feels like I am in Jamaica somewhere just groovin' and not caring about what others think. It's a remarkably different feeling I get here than any other place in the city. \n\nDon't forget to grab a bacon dog across the street afterwards :-)", "author": "Carlos A."}

I got a reservation through Savored, which gave us 30% off the meal. Sweet deal.\n\nThe coconut rum drink was rich and delicious. It can sneak up on you, so be wary! I ordered the coconut tilapia dish with couscous, which was also wonderful. The fried plantains with tamarind sauce was a highlight. You could say I went a little cocoNUTS, because I had the Kokomo at Blackbird later that night. ;) But I digress.\n\nOnly one thing irked me - on the menu, coconut rum drinks are listed at $7 a pop. Margaritas and the like were for the most part, also $7 each and $28 for a pitcher. Through this thing I'd like to call logic, since the pitcher price wasn't listed, I deduced that a pitcher of the coconut rum drink would also be $28... it showed up as $65 on the bill. Just for the pitcher.\n\nWe spoke with the staff, and they stated that the particular drink is priced that way because it requires more work/components? I'm still baffled, because their regular and top shelf pitchers are $28 and $34, respectively. Anyway, we were charged $34 instead, and still got 30% off as promised.\n\nI'd definitely come back here! Love the live music and food. I just wish they'd be a little more transparent with the drink menu.", "author": "Sophia T."}

At 8:30 pm, the place was pretty crowded. There was only a few tables left but I'm sure it was for reservations. While we were waiting for a table, we sat at the bar for some hibiscus cocktails. It was pretty delicious! Although it can use more alcohol... the drink went down like juice! About halfway through our drinks, we decided to order our entree at the bar. We had the Tilapia in coconut sauce. The dish now comes with white rice which is not Sengalese. We asked for the traditional style which comes with couscous. We drenched the couscous with coconut sauce and ate it with the Tilapia. It was totally delicious! I highly recommend asking for couscous hands down. The 1 entree and 2 cocktails were perfect as we weren't stuffed and no food wasted! Next time I'll try the plantains appetizers.\n\nWhen we finished, the owner walked us next door to show us the live African band, dance floor, etc. They host dance classes next door.

The ambiance is lovely: somewhat dim lighting, but candles light up every table, while lights on strings line the walls and parts of the ceiling. \n\nThe Tropical Salad was refreshing and delicious. Plenty of feta cheese sprinkled on top of fresh salad leaves and a circle of grapefruit and orange slices on the plate's outer ring. Bursts of flavor, sweet, slightly salty and sour, made it a great appetizer. Only bummer was that I asked for it with shrimp, but maybe they ran out? All good, still very appetizing.\n\nTook a tiny sip of the tamarind margarita, Salaan. Stung instantly and I scrunched up my face at its bitterness, but the aftertaste was alright; it settled into a smoother, sweet flavor. Guess I just like my juice/other basic sweet drinks haha. OJ over here, please!\n\nChicken Mafe with couscous. YUM. The sauce was just right, not over or under whelming, and the chicken meat just fell right off the bone. That is chicken done right! Came with two large drumsticks and a hearty serving of couscous, which I was surprised to find tons of raisins in - good thing we like raisins! The proportions of couscous and chicken were just right and both tasted great.\n\nBanana Flambee... wow. Anything banana is a plus in my book, but it was warm, chocolatey, rich, and the perfect ending to the meal. There were plenty of banana chunks too, so we were stuffed with dessert goodness.

For example, I've gone here a couple of times with friends and had a great time -- great music, everyone dancing, people on top of the benches/chairs, strong drinks being passed over from the bar.  Sooo much fun.  Granted, on these nights, we'd started out elsewhere with a few drinks, so perhaps you have to be in A State to have a great time here.\n\nBut I've gone twice without a big group (just with one other female friend) and ... it was not so good.  We realized the drinks are actually not that tasty nor strong after all, the music was a little cornier than we remembered, and we were constantly and aggressively hit on by guys who would just not take no for an answer.   It got to the point that we did not feel comfortable and decided to leave.  \n\nAlso, as a \"club,\" this place gets extremely crowded, and there is no coat check nor place to leave your belongings, other than shoving them on or under the benches along the wall.  So ladies, make sure you travel lightly!

Since I've had limited exposure to African food, I agreed.\n\nAfter hearing good reviews about the margarita, we got a pitcher of the tamarind and hibiscus margarita. We figured that since it's a combo of the tamarind margarita and the hibiscus margarita, both which are raved about individually, we would enjoy it exponentially. WRONG! It was so gross that I chugged it to save myself from having to taste it. It was like drinking a Long Island without the benefit of getting drunk in the end (okay fine.

Jenny C. got some garlic chicken with fried plantains (I think it's called the Dibi). It was okay.

It took adjusting of the taste buds but I ended up really liking the flavor of both... and you can't even taste the alcohol which is awessssomeee.\n\nWe started with the Pastelles which was helllla bomb.

Mmmmmm.. and the best part was the dessert -- Mango Melba -- who knew mangos could taste so good with chocolate sauce?!\n\nLittle Baobab becomes a dance club around 10. The DJ played a good mix that night, comprised of mainly reggae. Its a good spot if you're just looking to unwind and not get too cray cray.\n\nThe shack-like feeling of the restaurant, the benches, the cramped space, the paintings/photos on the wall, the friendly service, the amazing food, the good music at the end of the night -- makes you feel like you're not even in SF anymore!

Extending the city's global palate alone is a praiseworthy feat.  The drinks use a lot of uncommon drink ingredients such as hibiscus further adding to the unique character of the place.  The food gives a nice sampling into flavor combinations you don't find elsewhere.\n\nPlantano: The tamarind yogurt sauce made this dish with its tart, sweet and sour profile.  The plantains could have stood to be cooked softer, but they were decent and the dip made them beyond good.\n\nN'Dole: This was totally worth the trip!  Delicately tender lamb in a savory spinach peanut sauce.  I'm relatively unfamiliar with African cuisine so don't know the exact spices, but the flavor combination is not comparable to any other lamb curry from any other area (India, Pakistan, Caribbean, Middle East, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand) I've had before.  The couscous was a great carb choice since it absorbs the stew much better than rice and it is a nice change in this rice-centric town.\n\nMango Melba: Disappointing.  The mango bits were hard and not ripe enough.  The ice cream wasn't nearly as good as the artisan shops in the neighborhood and the chocolate sauce tasted cheap.", "author": "Adam B."}

I came here for the first time over a year ago after paying a visit to the San Francisco Tenant's Union around the corner (I've had monstrous landlord and roommate issues in the past, don't even get me started... but this is beside the point and a review to write another day). Anyway, there's nothin' like a little Senegalese lovin'--in the form of fried plantains and yogurt, sweet curry shrimp kebabs, and $5 cocktails--to nightcap ya after a long, tiring day of housing drama. Or at any point, really!\n\nI finally returned to the scene of my first affair a couple nights ago, when Jen. O and I met here to do some serious catching up over drinks and food. It turned out to be the perfect place for it. We were welcomed at the bar and not rushed as we carefully chose our first round (by the way, Little features all the same delicious cocktails as Bissap and more with a full bar, plus they're 2 or 3 bucks cheaper here!). Jenny went for a tamarind margarita and I did a hibiscus/vodka concoction--apparently hibiscus juice is a popular refreshment in Senegal... it's on the sour side, like cranberry juice. I liked my second choice more, the self-titled Little Baobab cocktail (vodka/passion/lime), and got two of those. Though I was tempted, I didn't order any food this time, but I did notice that the menu is similar yet a bit different from Bissap's. \n\nWe enjoyed a couple of hours in this colorful, laidback spot. The fact that it's off of Mission--just a little, but enough to make a difference--gives it a local yet homey vibe. Now I'm totally stoked to come back sometime for their African and Latin musica and/or live performances.

Get a reservation and  reach on time to get seated. We had  to wait at the bar till we were seated as we reached late. The ambiance had a cozy and fun vibe.\n\nWe ordered : \n1 pitcher hibiscus margarita and a tamarind pitcher - both of which were delicious like never tasted before!!\n\nEntree : \nGambas - prawns in curry sauce with rice, was yummilicious!\nseafood coco - heavenly with the creamy sauce \ndibi - tilapia dish, totally enjoyed\n\nThe food and drinks score a perfect 10, everyone enjoyed the heartiest meal. 5 star for food.\n\nHowever inspite of the great food we had a few complaints. As they started rearranging the dining area at 10 to make the dance floor everything went hay way. They didn't care of the people who were still eating and the service completely disappeared. As we were still eating, tables and chairs were removed, many of our orders just didn't arrive and noone even bothered to inform, for every little thing we had to run after a waiter to catch their attention! WHAT THE HELL!! You cant just throw away the customers who are still dining to start off your dance floor or atleast have some plan of order !!\n\nSomehow we finished our food in a hurry and as a compensation to our complaints we were offered a complimentary pitcher without an apology! Great!! Hence the service deserves just 1 star.\n\nOnce the music started the fun began, a complete refreshment to hear some different music unlike other clubs. The music was fantastic and everyone enjoyed. But the space was soo crammed that soon we could hardly stand and had to leave soon. \n\nMight return some day due to the impression the food made, but still forces to give a second thought for the clumsy service!!", "author": "Payal B."}

The decor is also very appealing to the eyes - African music in the background, candle lit atmosphere, African murals on the walls. Our waiter was very friendly and made sure that we enjoyed the food, which was very homey in a way.\n\nWe started off with the Pastelles, which were oh-my-god good but had us screaming for more after we devoured it (3 of us). Consequently, we shared the Yassa with tilapia and the Chicken with peanut sauce. Get the Yassa - you will not be disappointed. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back to this place again.

That was weird. \n\nFinally we got to sit and order, the waiter made it clear that he wanted us at the 2 person table and not the 4 person table immediately next to us. \n\nTen minutes later, the Karma Afrika crew shows up and some want food...well, they sat next to us at the 4 person table. We filled the place up so much they turned people down who wanted to have dinner here. \n\nI ordered the Tofu Curry with rice. I got the Tofu Curry with cous cous. The carrots undercooked and the other vegetables seemed overcooked. \n\nI noticed other people leaving who were waiting to order food, they were starving and went someplace else to eat. The service is pretty slow and confusing. They took a while to even take our friends orders. \n\nOnce the party started, we danced, drank yummy cocktails (tasty, sweet, lots of ginger, although sadly weak in alcohol), then started the Afro Raffle. \n\nThe other people working started taking out all the tables one by one. They wanted to take the table we were using for the Raffle prizes and event information.  We had already told them we would clear it after the raffle, since we needed to put the raffle tickets and Karma Afrika stuff there. They were very insistent and before our friend even got back to the table after announcing the winners and handing out prizes, they came at me for the table again. I had to gather everything before they swiped the table. One table, in the front corner of the room.\n\nMusic was good, we had fun. \n\nAll they need is a better system for the dinner turn music, bar and dancing.\n\nThe place is small. We deal with it.\n\n3.6 stars", "author": "Lorrie N."}

I've never been on a bad night.  There is always good music and good dancers.  (Salsa, African, reggae, etc. = all my favorites).  \nThe crowd is very mixed ages and ethnicity.  I've been there with every color friend, and they all had a blast!  I'm in my 20's and love it, but it's a place mom could even dig, because it's that well-rounded.  \n\nI especially like the vibe on the dance floor.  It's not like most clubs where if you dance with a guy once, you can't shake him & he thinks you're going home with him..  At Baobab, I can dance with everyone!  I've never had a problem with anyone's girlfriend or date getting mad either.  I mean, you dont have to dance with everyone (my friends spot the finest, most single-looking guy in the room and...).  \n\nThe men are always nice and respectful.  You can grind them if you want to, but that's not my style.  I like to keep a little room to show off some moves, and so far, most of the guys I've danced with there have some great moves of their own!  \n\nOne time, I did have a problem with a (really drunk) guy be really persistent trying to dance with me.  I gave him half a dance and he was too close for my comfort, so I walked away.  He kept trying to dance with me, until finally (without me asking), some guy I dont know (who was on a date), stopped him and said \"hey man, leave her alone, she's my sister\".  The drunk guy tried to dance with me one more time, and the sweet man on a date kindly escorted him out (not rough or anything...the drunk guy didn't even resist being guided out the door).  From there, the bouncer didn't let the drunk guy back in.  \n\nBut that's the type of place it is:  a total stranger will look out for you.  Everyone is polite there.  It's just an all-around great place, and I haven't ever been to a place that remotely compares to how awesome Baobab is.  Really!\n\n***************\noh!  There is the Baobab restaurant (fabulous food, and a great way to start the night!), then around the corner, there is the dance-club, which most of this review is based on.  I've gone to the restaurant a few times, and I am always very happy with the food.  But watch out if you think you're gonna be dancing later!  The portions are so large, and so delicious.  I almost fell in to a food coma on my way to the club (had to put my leftovers in the car first).  Once I got to the club, I had to sit for a few more minutes before I could hit the dance floor.", "author": "T T."}

The aftertaste of it is amazing.  It tastes like Asian food but has a delayed flavor that tastes like taco seasoning!  It is something that I may have to copy if I have to make an appetizer for functions.\n\n2. Plantano- Fried plantains - great flavor and cooked to perfection.  I didn't realize how much I missed fried bananas!\n\n3. Cari Volaille - chicken curry - very flavorful chicken with a broth almost like oxtail soup - great and filling entree\n\n4. Crevette Coco - shrimp in coconut sauce - very good dish in itself, but it feels like it could have been from any restaurant.  It did not stand out like the other dishes.\n\nThere was also excellent service from the one waitress tackling the whole place on a Monday night.  Beer was warm but I just pretended that's how it was supposed to be there.  I will definitely go to Bissap Baobab to compare it to this restaurant.  I would highly advise getting the first two appetizers I mentioned along with the Cari Volaille.\n\nTotal tab with the restaurant.com certificate: $19", "author": "Joey S."}

There was limited room at the bar and lounge so had to stand/huddle in a corner of the bar. While we waited, we ordered a few cocktails, which ended up being pre-mixed. They were extremely watered down so I asked the bartender to make it a bit stronger and she agreed; when my friend requested the same thing, however, she poured a little bit of extra mixer into his drink (ew). \n\nWhen we eventually sat down, we all found the food to be rather bland and forgettable, the service to be extremely slow, and the restaurant too loud to talk in. \n\nI have heard subsequently that it is a really fun place to go dancing later in the evening on a Friday or Saturday but I don't recommend it for a dinner with friends on the weekend.", "author": "Maggie J."}

This is a restaurant that turns into a club after 10.  Parking was a pain and after driving around for like 20 mts trying to find street parking, decided to just bite the bullet and pay $15 for parking. The neighborhood is a little iffy but there are usually a lot of people around so you should be ok. The place is tiny!  I am always looking for new kinds of cuisines and was excited to try Senegalese for the first time. The drinks were not that good. I tried a lot of different ones and the ginger and the orange cocktails were very disappointing. The hibiscus one was decent. The appetizers were good...had something that had bread with dipping sauce with shrimp. Then we had Aloko- plantains with sweet tamarind sauce which was surprisingly good. I had the chicken mafe with rice. This was awesome. Chicken with peanut sauce and spinach. Very tasty. If I was just rating this dish, I would give it 5 stars. \n\nNow on to the club.  I like African beats and the music was very catchy. It seemed like a combination of Caribbean, House, Meringue and Salsa. You know the awkward moment at any club at the beginning of the evening where no one wants to be the first on the dance floor and people hang around till there are more people on the floor so they can lose themselves in the crowd. Well, I am kinda like that too. Anyways, since the music was really good, we got on the dance floor and were doing our thing. But other than a couple of other people, nobody else was dancing! There are benches on the sides and it seemed like folks were content just sitting and watching us. My date got weirded out after like 5 songs and we ended up leaving. Good food, great music, could have been an awesome time if only the more people got up and danced. Come on people,  get up and DANCE!", "author": "Sunil R."}

Unfortunately, while the lamb itself was tender, the sauce was overly heavy and salty and overpowered any flavor that the lamb itself had.  The couscous was pretty dry flavorless too.

It definitely seems like a hole in the wall from the outside, but I was pleasantly surprised. The interior decor although very festive and nice, has some bits lacking like the exposed drywall that never got seamed, but it still has a nice ambiance that makes you ignore those parts. Now, as for the food, at our table of 20, everyone loved their dishes. This seems like one of those places where you can't go wrong with what you order. Everything was good, and I loved that tamarind and hibiscus were a bit of a theme (in the drinks too). At 10, they took away the tables and it turned into a dance club, with good music that was a mix of african, latin, reggae, and pop. It kept you moving, and was an all around good time. Our group danced for about 2 hours and left just past midnight, where we saw people waiting to get in outside, and it seemed like they may have to pay a cover if you hadn't been there for dinner before hand. Only negative: the bathroom door doesn't lock... which makes you pretty nervous and it's best to go with a friend so they can watch the door to make sure no once barges in on you. Also- there was a sign that you can't flush the toilet paper, so you had to throw it in the garbage container next to the toilet... NOT appealing.

Psych. What a let down.\n\nI write this review as 1 member of 5, out of a group of 10, that were completely dissatisfied with this place (math is hard, half of us liked it, half of us didn't).  Service was slow and spotty.  Our reservation was for 8:00 pm and we didn't get our food until 9:45 pm.  Mind you, the place turns into a dance club at 10:00 pm (and not a minute later) so by 10:01 pm dinner was forcefully over (no major disappointment as I was not really planning on eating my tofu mush anyways).  Drinks are delicious, but prepare to feel more sober then you arrived after finishing a couple (I will suggest that this might have to do with the extreme amount of sugar, oh, and the fact they have no alcohol in them).\n\nUGH. The dancing.  Don't even get me started on the dancing.  Now, I will preface this with: I am not much of a dancer.  But after a few (real) drinks, decent beats, and an inviting crowd, I can get down with the best of them.  Let's just say, no bueno.  I haven't been gropped this badly since my unfortunate decision to head to Tijuana for my 18th birthday.  All I needed was a whistle and someone pouring tequila down my throat.\n\nI would have given it \"0\" stars, but like I said, half my friends did dig this place.

It was good, although Steph and I were longing for a little sugar sprinkled on top, but the tamarind dipping sauce eventually grew on us. The meat in our entrees (lamb and chicken) was overcooked, so the meat was tough. The tofu curry was very mild and lacking flavor, but maybe that's just how it supposed to taste. I will say that the couscous was excellent, very light and fluffy, and probably the best I've ever had.\n\nIt's a bit cramped inside, but it wasn't crowded on a Monday night, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

She's wanted to go to Little Baobab to dance the night away. So off to SF and the Mission District we went to celebrate. \n\nWe got to Little Baobab around 11PM. The best way to describe it is a shack playing really loud music you can hear down the block. There was no line to get in but there was a $5 cover. We paid the cover and walked in and holy sardine city, this place was packed. And by packed I mean you barely enough room to move in the place. If the fire Marshall came, this place was definitely be over the person capacity and they would probably fine the place. \n\nI managed to get us to a spot where we can leave our jackets and try to squeeze into the dance floor. My wife and her friend went to the bar to get drinks (I figured being girls they had a better chance of getting served than I would) and they managed to squeeze their way to get drinks. Low and behold in a crowded bar, 5 minutes later, they had our drinks. I have to say the prices for beer on tap here is pretty cheap. I think my wife said for all the drinks they paid under $10. Pretty good price for beer on tap on a Friday Night. \n\nSo off to dancing they went. As I said before the place was crowded, and it seemed like they let even more people in. I guess their policy is if you got $5 bucks, they're going to let you need. At one point it was so packed in there we could hardly move, let alone dance. The other problem, was the music was so loud. I think my wife and her friend said it was a combination of Reggatone, Caribbean, and Afrocentric Music, to me and my poor ears, it was just loud thumping music that made my ears rings all the way home to the East Bay. \n\nAlso 2 disturbing things here, it's a gropefeast and they guys here are extremely aggressive and don't get no for an answer. My wife on more than one occasion when someone tried to cut in on us pointed to her ring on her finger and pointed to me and they would turn around and see me and I would nod and jerk my head and they got the clue. Her friend wasn't as fortunate and had to be a little bit more aggressive and just flat out rejects the guy and point to us. Other other thing is both my wife and her friend said on a couple of occasions they got groped by someone. Hell even I got my ass grabbed a coupled of times. Not sure if it was on purpose or by accident because it was so packed in there, none the less, it didn't make either one of the girls truly comfortable in Little Baobob. \n\nAs to rating, I guess if I was in my 20's, into really loud music, and didn't have any issues with personal space, Little Baobab would be a fun place to come hand out at. But being in my 30's and married, I left all that behind me and for me Little Baobab is nothing but a place that is way too small, that plays way too loud of music, with way to many people trying to get a cheap feel on one an other. Not my way of spending a Friday Night and 2 stars for Little Baobab as a night club.", "author": "Chris C."}

I'm obsessed with Africa. Get me talking about my travels and I will NOT stop. So to find a little piece of authentic Africa here in San Francisco is like a dream come true.\n\nWe got there semi-early (10pm or so) on a Thursday so we didn't pay cover and the place wasn't very crowded. We instantly clicked with the bartenders (yummmy hibiscis drinks, but a little too sweet) and we started the dance party the second the DJ started spinning. He played awesome beats from Africa, reggae and a little hip-hop mixed in. From the decor to the clientele to the music, I felt like I was back in West Africa. The most authentic detail of this place? Over eager African men with amazing dance skills hitting on every girl in the place. But I couldn't complain because when someone can move that good you can forgive them for creeping all up on you. \n\nI intend to be a regular so if anyone wants to join me for some awesome dancing to great music, hot & friendly bartenders and a taste of Africa, I'll see you there!", "author": "Lauren B."}

I've been looking for a low-key place with interesting music.\n\nHowever, this review is for the food.  Last time I was at Little Baobab was over a year ago for dinner, and I guess it didn't make a huge impact on me cuisine-wise as I haven't returned despite being right in the neighborhood.\n\nI returned when getting a phone call from Arnold G. saying that he was there with Steph P. for dinner and would I like to join them.  They are such good company that I will join them anywhere.\n\nI give them kudos for frying the tofu right for the Cari Tofu dish.  It had that slight crispy exterior that I feel is perfect for pan-fried tofu.  However, the sauce was too unassuming and lacked spices.\n\nThe Chicken Mafe...eh.  Chicken was tough.  As Arnold G. pointed out, white meat chicken is not the easiest to cook.  I do feel, though, that any restaurant serving white breast chicken should learn not to overcook the breast.  Also, oddly, the chicken breast was a large chicken breast filet rather than chicken chunks.  For a dish where so much is about the sauce, I feel that the chicken filet is a disservice.  One wants maximum sauce-sopping opportunities. The sauce was okay, but I've made better chicken in peanut butter sauce myself (look up the Gourmet recipe for chicken and okra in peanut butter sauce on Epicurious...it's excellent.  Just remember to keep stirring so that it doesn't burn).  I always hate that feeling of paying for food in a restaurant that I can cook better myself.  What can I say...I am a penny-pincher that way.\n\nThe Lamb N'Dala (I am using Steph's reviews here to recall the names of the dishes...which I've promptly forgotten) was the best of the three dishes we got.  It was the most assertive and complex of the sauces.  However, the lamb cubes would have benefitted from being braised for a long time in an oven on low heat.\n\nPlaintain...nothing special.  Something you can pan-fry quickly yourself  if you remember to get really ripe plaintains.\n\nPrice was cheap, roughly $14 per person.  But I can do better at Chutney or Pakwan, get more tender meats and spicier sauces.  I know it seems weird to be comparing Indian restaurants to a Sengalese restaurant, but the sauces have many similiarities.  I think next time I will skip the novelty of the Sengalese food, go to Pakwan, and head over this way for the dancing.", "author": "Sooj O."}

The ginger and vodka w/ cran is of course my standard at Little Baobab. \r\n\r\nI remember one night meeting 2 guys from Morocco (one of whom I will call Mr Touchy) and here we are chatting it up about our families , life back home in the mother land , about the fact that Mr Touchy  has  a girlfriend ...blah blah blah blah... (like I give a hoot...while of course am giving goo goo GA GA eyes) and having drinks which led to last call and we ended up sharing a cab home. Of course with anyone a bit inebriated the sexes can get confused (Oh please...another excuse) and of course next thing you know dude is rubbing my legs and am like \"YO ... u got a girlfriend what's up with that?... not that I mind... (should have been minding my own business and could have been invited up for a night cap or it could have turned into a knee cap considering the job to be done).\r\n\r\n... so anyways weeks go by and Bambi is at the O'Farrell and Mason Garage getting the rental and who do I spot Mr Touchy and his dude date (holding hands) ... so much for his Gf and so much for my weak ass Gay  radar... well u win some and you lose some... \r\n\r\nBut for sure good times will be had at Little Baobab alone or with friends.", "author": "Teddy d."}

Head here early for an intimate little dinner with friends before they clear out the little tables for dancing to DJ music. The ginger-infused cocktails are amazingly intoxicating (yes, pun intended). They are unique and delicious. The food is just as good as at Bissap Baobab. If you have more than four peeps in your group, get there early so that everyone can be seated as there is not much seating there. \n\nWhen the DJ starts, this place gets packed, _packed_, fast. Now you understand why all the chairs and tables are taken away. The dancing is pretty good until there's no room to even sway side to side and some inconsiderate couple decides they want to take up the floor doing wild swing moves.

They graciously accomodated our party of about 20 despite telling them only the day beforehand that we were coming.  They sat us outside, and luckily it was a beautiful September night, warm enough to sit outside without a coat!\n\nWe started with a pitcher of their \"Rose\" cocktail.  If I remember correctly it is vodka mixed with cranberry and ginger.  I liked it so much it was all I drank the rest of the night, though others in my party branched out and tried the other drinks, all of which were made with FRESH fruit juice.\n\nThe food was decent.  The appetizers were great, but my entree of shrimp kebabs was disappointing.  To start, try the sauteed shrimp and the fried bananas. \n\nAfter dinner, when they clear away the tables for the dance club, the place picked up.  They gave us stamps so we wouldn't have to pay the cover, and when we were finished with dinner we headed inside, as you can't have any alcohol outside after 10.  It was really fun, as the music is different from anything I'd been to in SF, and I felt like I could dance with my friends without having to worry about being hit on by sketchy guys.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

My roommate and I decided to get something different from each other so we could sample as many menu items as possible.  So between two of us, we had the avocat creole (stuffed avocado with spicy crab and rice-delicious!!!) and the baobab gambas for appetizer (shrimps in a spicy, yumm broth). For our entrees, we had the Crevette Coco, a plate of shrimps with your choice of couscous or rice covered in coconut milk cream sauce (kinda similar to thai curry..this was my favorite dish of the night), and the N'Dole, a huge plate of spicy lamb in a peanuty spicy sauce with couscous or rice. For dessert, we got one of each of the 2 selections they had: the warm chocolate cake and the mango melba, which is just vanila ice cream over mango and covered with caramel/chocolate sauce. For our cocktails, we got the the Flamboyant (hibiscus lime vodka) and the Little Baobab cocktail, my favorite!! It had hints of passion fruit and tamarind.  The flavors melded perfectly! I got an extra one cus it was so good and it gave me a lovely buzz :)\n\nThis was the second time I came here.  The first time I came, I decided to go vegetarian and ordered the Mafe Tofu.  It was good, but I heard the Chicken Mafe is much better.  \n\nAll in all, my experience here was lovely.  Our server was a cute young man who was in training still, but we thought he did a fabulous job! Super friendly staff, great food and drinks, exotic music, and a cute little intimate space.  Great for dates!  I hear they have dancing and a dj at night, so I must check that out one day.  I hear it's really fun!  I recommend going on Monday nights so you can get a little taste of everything.  For $20, you can really get the Senegalese food experience and a lot of it too.  I came out with a big buddha belly.

I came here a few saturday nights ago with my sister & her entourage to meet my girls from college. Despite the spot not being very big at all, I kept losing my peoples because of the place being so dark and crowded. \n\nMy only complaint is the same complaint I have with all san francisco locations: lack of parking.

It can get crowded.  \n\nThere was a $5 cover, and after that, the beers are $3, and the special margaritas were $5.

I am from Jamaica and since I have moved to California I have not been able to recreate that familiar feeling of the islands.  I have been to Little Boabab four weekends in a row and absolutely love it.  I am pretty much against admission to clubs. I think after age of 26 years old you pretty much stop paying to get into places. If you have to pay then you know the crowd is too young.  The admission cost is only $5.00 so I don't mind.  The cocktails there are scrumptious but do not MIX because you will get sick. I normally stick with the Tamarind, Ginger, and Whiskey drink. I can only handle two of them, strong and good.  They are reasonably priced and well worth the $$. \n\nThe music is amazing!!!! I love the reggae, roots, and African beats. They make my body respond in ways that I can't describe... ha ha ha ha! The only fall back is how damn CROWDED it is. Every one is shoulder to shoulder and it is HOT as in heat!  I normally do not like crowded places but like I said it reminds me of back home.  The sweaty crowded experience contributes to the African pulsating rhythms of  UNITY.  A very diverse crowd, which I love.  All races, all classes, all together having a good time.

You can tell that the people who work here really care about the quality of the food.

They have a great happy hour deal from 6 to 7:30 where you get an appetizer, entr\u00e9e, a dessert and a drink for $20. We each started with the tropical salad that was incredible. I'm not a big fan of salad but I enjoyed every bite. For the entr\u00e9e I had the N'Dole. It was very good but the lamb was just a bit tough. It was very tasty and the couscous was also very good. My friend had the crevette coco. She said it was delicious. For dessert we both had the warm chocolate cake. It was small but very good. Everything was presented beautifully.

I also enjoyed the mango ice cream, again very good. Then the bill came, first it was the wrong bill, then the server brought the correct one but the happy hour price hadn't been applied. It was then corrected. I guess I would expect that my portion of the meal would be comped because of the water in my lap but it wasn't.

My girl got the hibiscus margarita (@ $5)- also quite excellent, but I am glad I had my choice. \n\nI will definitely return for their happy hour - goes from 5:30-7:30, with $2.50 house cocktails!", "author": "Brett H."}

It felt like a small houseparty with a GREAT DJ spinning some awesome reggae (both unheard tunes as well as the typical crowd pleasers). Little Baobap is located in a very quaint area of the Mission on 19th & Mission, so you could easily miss the bar if you do not have a street address. My best description of the space is like a beach shack that you would find in Goa, India where people go to basically to dance the night away. You can show up in sneakers, t-shirts, beanies, and still not receive doorman attitude! The $3 cover to hear some fantastic beats is well worth it - and you know that a place is still hot when people of all ethnicities are dancing it up to the same music. Go to Baobap if you are willing to dance - not to visit a meatmarket. Sitting on the sidelines drinking a beer is not going to cut it here...\r\n\r\nI can't wait to check out the music on the other nights because this place is known for their eclectic music selections. I think the best way to do Baobap is to bring a group of 6-8 ppl. who are ready to move.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I went here on a Friday night with about 11 people and I had one of the best nights ever in SF. The Afro-French music was sick, and all the people were having a great time. I think I must have sweated off about 2 lbs in the hot bar. Sogie has to be THE DJ that has the best taste in international music that I have seen yet! This is definitely my place to keep visiting again and again. My only wish is that the bar was slightly bigger now that it has gotten so popular.", "author": "Nirav K."}

The curry that i love most (cari vollaile) now comes without yam or potato.  Previously the menu said it came with yam and potato, but on occasion it didn't and i would count the days when i was sadly surprised by the lack of potatoey goodness on my plate as bad little baobab days.  Also, the chicken used to come cut up into little pieces that were nicely placed on top of the curry, for easy mixing in and capturing of flavor.  On my most recent visit the chicken was just a big dull single chicken piece.  Why do I care so much about these things?  I don't know, but this is my review so I'm allowed to.\n\nNow it's probably best if we don't even talk about the service at this place.  Because it's good about one out of every five times, and when it's bad it's very very even pushover sharon doesn't want to leave a tip bad.  \n\nAnd the music is too loud when you're trying to eat.\n\nbut, on the plus side,  it IS an incredibly cute place with really unique food that you can't find elsewhere (or at least i haven't been able to).  and it IS very very near to  my house.  and it never fails to impress visitors.", "author": "Sharon M."}

The second pitcher was a pinkish cocktail named something flowery, but it was basically straight whiskey with a touch of some sweet nectar.

(NOTE:  There was one time when I went and the usual DJ must've been MIA because this DJ had NO IDEA how to blend beats together.  In between every song, there was an awkward pause as each of us repositioned ourselves accordingly to the beat of the song.)  Not to mention the crowd is, more often than not, laid back, relatively attractive, knows how to dance and not just grind their genitals on each other.  \n\nLittle Baobab is one of my favorite places to go out because it's chill, dirt cheap, there are no Forever 21 skeezies and popped-collared \"brahs\" rubbing up on each other, and the music is amazing.  If you prefer bass-humping and girls who like to wear headbands as miniskirts, I would guess that this place is not for you.", "author": "Grace K."}

It was perfect. Price wasn't that bad at all either. \n\nMy only minus one was when the restaurant turned to a dance floor, the guys just abruptly took the tables without prepping us....but the waitress was very nice and courteous enough to acknowledge that.", "author": "Yo S."}

I stuck with a cup of ginger tea since I wasn't feeling too well.

Yum. I'd come back to try out their other dishes.\n\nDidn't stay for the nightlife, but we passed by on the way home and there was a line outside the door with bass bumping against the walls.

I like Little Baobab for ambiance a bit more than Big Brother Baobab, but granted I've only gotten drunk at BBB, not eaten there.

Because there's nothing worse than wanting to get down on a Saturday in San Francisco without a car.  What it boils down to is one shot (unless your date/friends/whoever is a trooper/drunk/gullible) and that one shot needs to be right.\n\nAs said previously, Little Baobab is small, hot, and cramped.  The DJ's selections are hot and cold: sometimes ol' boy is on the money, sometimes (between the less-than-graceful crossfade and the hopeless attempt at beat syncronization) you'll have to work twice as hard to keep your groove . . . provided you dance to the groove.\n\nActually, here's a PSA for all you Little Baobab regulars: please, PLEASE dance in the groove.  If you actually have to stop and think on whether or not you danced in the groove, YOU DIDN'T DANCE IN THE GROOVE.  Your sharp elbows, heavy feet, and awkward bodies make it hard on those who can sufficiently control more than 30% of their body mass.\n\nLittle Baobab is one of the cooler spots to go to in SF.

It gets crazy humid so wear clothes accordingly.  The cover is also usually only $2-3.  Most of the time it is nothing.\n\nGetting drinks would be the only drawback.

The specialty about the food is only really the sauce because the food across the plates seem pretty standard also another thing that is worth noting is the dishes are quite small and for $12 a dish or $13 a dish I think that they should really serve more food, sometimes I feel that this is only about snack size, it was quite a small bowl of soup whiff not that  many shrimp when I had the shrimp stew also the service was decent the two subsequent times I went, and nothing to compare to the first time at all also the boxes aren't the greatest quality, as at one point when I bought three boxes of food while all the boxes and all the food became one saucy pancake and this was all before the boxes got a little crushed from moving around, because they were merely paper the sources were already leaking from Box to box I also think it was here that I fell off of a chair, because the chair that is at the back room of this establishment isn't as sturdy", "author": "Rachel N."}

I spent a lot of time mashing the rice in the coconut milk and eating it because it tasted good but it was a little like eating a bowl of cookie dough -fun while you're doing it, and later you think maybe that it wasn't such a good idea and you'd better not do it again.

We ordered Soju and Pineapple (They were out of a few other concoctions) and as we sipped them down, he poured the extra for us! 2. Our favorite song was playing and after we took a shot we went to go dance without paying yet.

While he didn't have Beanie Man and some others, he did suggest bringing it to play next time! The music is unique, cultural, and great! \n-The crowd is very international.

When my friends and I first arrived the crowd was still warming up.  There were people on the edges of the floor still getting comfortable with the idea of dancing.  Not too long after our arrival the people started arriving.  And boy was it packed!  All races were there and in what seemed to be a very genuine way.  I was surprised because-even in places that seem diverse like the mission-usually the crowd is regulated to a bunch of white well read folks or hipsters or something like that.  Rarely do you get Hispanics and African Americans and Asians.  It was refreshing.  Honestly-a bit of a seeming paradise in a way.  It is a bit of a meat market pick up scene where some macho like guys sort of surround some of the dancing women on the floor.  \r\nAnd=counter to the tropical vibe-because the space is so run down and you can see the chefs in the background washing dishes and the ground feels unfinished, the ceiling sorta falling apart and the makeshift bar on the side-it kind of just feels like a high school party.  Like some guy had his basement for the weekend while his parents were away so invited every one and their brother over to dance.  And dance you do and dance you will.  You pretty much have no choice.  Because if you are in the room you have to move with the collective sweaty mass of people or you will be left out, literally left outside.  \r\nI had a great time here on Saturday night and I highly recommend this place for  a good time with friends.  \r\nI did not eat there and honestly would be somewhat afraid to based on some of the horror stories involving roaches and such in past reviews.

Well, we tried to diversify and had Cari Tofu (a thin, translucent curry sauce, but very different from any other curry spice blend that I've ever had. you think curry and expect something a little more piquant), Chicken Mafe (peanut sauce served w/ the fluffiest, most buttery couscous I've had in a while), and the Lamb N'Dala (well, it was N'something - lamb w/ a thick brown spinach sauce).

As soon as we open the door, I was simply drawn in by this energy that was buzzing around. I can't explain it, but it just produced a fever to dance. And that's what I like about Little Baobab. Everyone is there to dance. Not sway, not bob, not holding your drink while you dance in a circle with a pile of purses in the middle and check out the meat market produce of the night, but DANCE! And by Jove if you don't dance you will just be trampled. It was mostly Calypso/Soca with a little Reggaeton sprinkled in here and there to keep it diverse. I was never a fan of Calypso music, but it just sucks you into this tornado of happiness and bliss.\nSure the air was dense with sweat, which would have really bothered me, had it not been for the fact that there were fans on throughout.

A group of friends and I were out in the mission looking for a group that could comfortably handle our 12-15 size group when a friendly guy waved at us and invited us to sit. This was where it all started to go wrong. \nWe were at the bar trying to awkwardly fit, when we saw some empty tables. We all filed in and were happy to finally get a spot for everyone when we were suddenly told we were only welcome to sit for \"5 more minutes\" by a member of the staff. We decided to at least finish our current round before discussing our next move, when no kidding, a minute later, another staff member comes and tells us we will need to move in 5 minutes. A little annoyed, we continued on with our drinks and conversation, when a minute later (not quite the five minutes we were expecting) we were told we would have to get up NOW. We still had drinks in hand! So a friend stood up to tell some of us out of ear shot what was going on, and his chair was taken from underneath him, without warning or apology. Slowly tables were taken right from under our arms, and we were not offered alternative seating. \nDisgusted, I pulled the man aside who had been taking the chairs and told him how I felt about their choice to force us so quickly from our seats. He offered a sorry, but said it is \"the rules\" and quickly went back inside to take more tables from still seated friends finishing their drinks. \nNow to be fair, I didn't try the food, but it didn't look awful. We never got a chance to get further than our single round of drinks, and that it probably as close as I'll get to their food. In a neighborhood filled with great food and atmosphere, I wouldn't risk the embarrassment of going through this again.", "author": "Kelly B."}

I didnt mind when it was packed and could hardly move or plenty of space and first on the dance floor, was great people and great fun!!!! Then one night a friend and I were dancing on the floor when a random lady pushed my friend for no reason, almost knocking her on me. Remind you this is a packed club and my friend and I usually ignore random bumps and elbows since it will happen at a club. But my friend turned around when it happened a second time and said  \"EXCUSE YOU\" - may not have been in a nice tone, but neither was the push. Immediately this woman starts placing the palm of her hand in my friends face and told her \"I need my space, b****!\" We have been dancing in the same spot for over 2 hours already, and we are peaceful people who have NEVER EVER in the 15 years I have known my friend, NEVER ONCE have been in a fight or even a heated conversation with another person. My friend felt threatened and was ready to defend herself from this crazy person who was continuing with her threats and \"ENTITLEMENT\" of the spot she has now claimed on the very packed dance floor. I grabbed my friend and we went outside, I told the bouncer that there was a woman inside that was starting fights and pushing random people and that she pushed my friend and started attacking us. They asked me to point her out and I did, I told them I don't mind giving a statement and pointing this person out because I would hate another person who was having a great time to be disturbed by a person on the dance floor pushing her way through. They then told my friend and I that this person knew the owner and there was nothing else but to talk to her about the incident. As I was waiting on another friend to come out of the bathroom, I noticed the bouncer talking to this woman and thought good, they got her. Then saw her go back in. The bouncer told my friend and I that they cannot kick her out because she knew the owner, so we left! I am sorry, but I will not give business to someone who allows their friends to disrespect their place of business (who does that - FYI I would never have the nerve to disrespect any of my friends places of business, whether they work there or own them!) and has the right to disturb and harass their PAYING customers in that sort of way.

I was on board for the big electronic music scene in 2000, but over time the scene became incredibly repetitive... same people, same music, same everything... and the reality no longer lived up to the hype the way it used to.\n\nAnd besides, I'm a breaks girl... hands down.  Finding good breaks is next to impossible these days with the glitch & constant house overload.\n\nI think I've found a good compromise though at Little Baobab.  I first found the music at this place during carnival & I loved the vibe.  I've started going on the occasional Friday night for some really great African fusion that gives me the syncopation of breaks, the hip action from the latin influences, and a generally good crowd.\n\nIt's small, sweaty, and crowded as hell, but I'm completely down with the hibiscus drinks and fun djs.  It's a place where you might get groped, but it's also a place where someone could be asking you to dance because they genuinely want to DANCE with you.  Refreshing.", "author": "Kelly W."}

After a few seconds I found his whole style rather cool.\nI dunno if if I like dark places to have dinner, anymore. It always feel as if the establishment is hiding something.\nI make my way to the restroom. Which was near someone's table. Eek.\nI couldn't see the light switch. Is this it?

Spicy Lamb with spinach and peanut sauce. And the Sande. Vodka with ginger and oj. I like spicy. It's like 'Vivacious'\nSounds good right?\nBetween 7 and 10 minutes my our drinks arrive. Hey, the bartender was busy. \nWait. This don't taste like what I ordered. I taste gin, grapefruit juice and ginger.\n'Dude. I think she got you the Saff!' My friend tells me.\nAh well.

I'm satisfied.\nI thought the bill/prices a bit too high for the totality of what we got, but hey, it's SF,right?\nWhat tripped me out the most was that we were in the middle of their transition from dining room to club/dance place. Tables were being taken away. Our bill was dropped even though we didn't ask for it and i was planning to order more drinks. It was freaky. We were finishing our dinner and there was people sitting and milling about. And we were  one of the last tables. Some guy came by and said something incoherent to us and stamped our wrist.\nWait?

DJs were good playing a good mix of reggae, latin, and hip hop music which got me dancing most of the night.  So Little Baobab is a very small restaurant turned into a club at night and it gets very very crowded as the night goes on.  To the point where you can't even walk but reason being the place is not much bigger than my living room.  So the more people the hotter it gets and I was sweating profusely due to the fact that it was hot and I was dancing.  There's only one bathroom and it's in the back so you have to push through the crowd to get to it.  But the biggest thing is that drinks are expensive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-30", "description": "I first went here a little way back, maybe late '05.  It started on a wednesday night and a co-worker was telling me that there's this koo ass spot on mission that plays some good dancehall.  Knowing me, I'm all down for dancehall so a bunch of us went to go check it out after work.  \n\nSo this review is for Wednesday night at Baobab..\nWell, to start, this place is very small.  If you think Milk on Haight or Blue Triangle (do they still call it that?) on Fillmore/Lombard was tiny, you'll be amazed how small this spot was.  the DJ took up most of the spot, and it's hard to distinguish what part is bar area or dance area.  Dancefloor is small and can get crowded with drunk people dancin all over the place. Cover was like $2 I think, somewhere rougly at that price. It has a small (very very small) patio outside where people socialize and blah.  The crowd is diverse and down to earth, none of that \"I'm urban and I only listen to underground hiphop\" or \"i'm a bimbo and I'm here to listen to some radio top 40\"  type of people that flood the MILK bar (haight).  Ok. Lemme apologize that all sounded kinda stereotypical but, it's not a stereotype for nothin.  But anyhoo, the music was good.  I forgot who was mixin, but I heard alot of music I haven't heard of at that time.  It was koo, because each time a song came up I would tell someone, or anyone, \"This is my jam!!\" or \"Oh My God!! I love this song\" and I'd just pull anyone to dance with me.  It could be guy, girl, animal, whatever.  and that's the story of what happens when they play good music.\n\nI know it doesn't sound much exciting, but I had a blast there.  People that go there usually are strictly into the music, and just bein high and sittin there jammin is already good enough. Not sayin I do (don't tell), but also I'm just the type of person that don't care much about goin to a spot JUST to talk to the opposite sex.  Which is the reason why there's so many whack people at clubs.  Whatever.  Thats just some fake ass shit to me.  Why can't alot of people just meet someone when they're sober at  a more suitable spot. Why you gotta have a girl or a guy drunk to be attractive to you? or even ATTRACTED TO YOU? haha! that's some lame game. My bad, needed to vent..but back to the point..\n\nYou'll enjoy this spot if your into dancehall, and fine with dancing in with limited space..\nand another thing, I don't know how it is now cuz everytime time I pass by there on wed night, it's packed.

That said, my experience here was a bit disappointing. I had been to a big birthday part at Bissap Baobab (what I guess was the larger version of Little Baobab...duh) and really enjoyed myself. The decor, the food, the drinks, everything. Upon returning in search of a unique, fun experience I was disappointed to find out they had downsized to what was no longer fun funky, but sort of depressing funky. The food was even funky, a bit scary to behold and not very impressive in flavor. We ordered the crab and avocado appetizer and I could have sworn it was canned crab with mayonnaise and cumin. Kind of gross, and presented with no care. Basically, its a sad shadow of what it once was and it left me with a bad feeling in my stomach.

We shared the crab/avacado dish (the taste was perfect, but I think the avocado was a little too hard and should have ripened for one more day), lamb salad (I'm not a fan of lamb, although, I did try one bite, and I admit it's the best lamb I've eaten... still wouldn't eat it again though), chicken curry w/ couscous (awesome!), plantains (the sauce that goes w/ it is sweet and tangy... a good addition, but I can happily eat plantains by it's lonesome), and curried shrimp (maybe a little too sweet or coconutty?, but worth a try).  We each had two rounds of our fave drinks (little baobob & hibiscus margarita)... so good & so cheap!  I love it.  And, to top it off, we dug into a warm brownie a la mode.  That night couldn't have gotten better.  The cool guy who sat us even gave us free admittance back in for dancing.  And, my friend commented that our bill entailed we were cheap dates... I'm cool with that.", "author": "Christine O."}

Being my attempt at senegalese cuisine, I really had no idea what to expect.  I ended up getting the N'Dole as an entree, while we split the Plaintain appetizer.  The plaintains were quite good, lightly fried on the outside, tender on the inside...how it should be.  The N'Dole on the other hand was pretty mediocre.  It was advertised to be spicy and was not spicy at all.  In fact, I would say the entire entree was on the bland side.  The lamb itself was not particularly tender slices of meat.  On the other hand, my friend got the Cari Yap.  I was able to get one piece of the lamb, which was far more juicy and tender than the lamb in the N'Dole.  I also got a Banana Drop as a cocktail, and the fresh ginger is definitely a nice touch in a cocktail.  Overall, there were some decent things that I would try it again (but not the N'Dole), but I would say I was rather lukewarm about the whole thing.", "author": "David L."}

Too grabby and stupid music for the most part, and I hate having to dress all slutty or risk looking like the old lady. But this place was awesome! The music was fun (even though I didn't know a lot of it) and the crowd was all there pretty much just to have fun, from what I could judge - and I know I had a lot of fun. Cover was cheap ($5) and they have a free water cooler. I hate when clubs charge for water. I was driving so I didn't try their drinks. The missing star is because the decor could use some work and there was pee all over the one tiny bathroom, but really not such a big deal in the big picture.

My apartment is larger than the entire club, yet they somehow cram in 60+ people, a DJ booth, coat check, bar and 1stall bathroom into the space without violating fire code. They have a cover ($3 before midnight, $5 afterward--we got there at like 12:15, so they probably would've had 5 stars had we not had to pay the extra--I know so little money, but it's the principal of the thing) but once you're inside, you're treated to some of the most delightful drinks (delightful, that is, if you like your drinks sweet, like House Party 1 kool-aid sweet-holla at me if you know what I mean). $5 got you a strong mix of ginger, tamarind, hibiscus and rum. Great stuff, goes straight to your head. The music is a booty-shaking mix of dance hall and reggaeton.  I definitely had fun and will be back again, this time arriving before midnight.", "author": "Donna W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-16", "description": "We finally tried Little Baobab the other day for dinner. We had a party of 6, which gave us the opportunity to sample most of the menu. We went for the $20 3-course prix fixe menu (served until 7:00pm) which includes appetizer, entre, dessert, and cocktail and is a huge bargain. The appetizers were a little hit-or-miss. The best were the gambas (shrimp), perfectly cooked and served in an intensely flavorful broth accompanied by little pieces of pita bread, and the fried plantains with tamarind sauce. The crab and avocado appetizer was underwhelming (it seemed to be mostly canned tuna with a little bit of crab meat mixed in), and the salads were fine but unexceptional. The entrees were all excellent. I had the salmon and also tried two different lamb dishes (one in a peanut sauce and one in a curry sauce), a chicken dish, a tofu dish, and a shrimp dish. Everything was great but the lamb, and especially the curry lamb, really stood out. Dessert was a little bit of a letdown, as they were out of several items and the only option was a chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. The souffle was quite dry but was tasty enough. The cocktails were also a bit hit and miss. I had a \"fleur,\" a strong ginger and whiskey concoction which I quite liked. I sampled a banana drink which was drowned in what seemed like generic margarita mix to the point where you could barely taste the banana. Overall, the food and drinks were very good, if a little uneven, with a few standout dishes. At $20 the overall value was outstanding, and this is what really pushes Little Baobab into 4 star territory. I might even consider rating Little Baobab 5 stars if not for the terrible service. Our waiter was extremely inattentive and impossible to flag down  (or even find- taking a \"smoke\" break maybe?). In an establishment this small, where there were maybe one or two other parties dining, this was just inexcusable. Despite its flaws, I'd certainly recommend Little Baobab for a casual, bargain-priced dinner or drinks.", "author": "Brian H."}
