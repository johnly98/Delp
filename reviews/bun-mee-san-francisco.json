The meat (I ordered a Grilled Pork Sandwich) was a bit dry and their bread a bit tough. The shredded carrots and white radish weren't as pickled as I'd like them to be. They charge extra for pate, which was an interesting decision. The place is OK if you're craving, but if you have the time, find a better restaurant for your Bahn Mi. \n\nI would give them three stars instead of two, but when I went in I discovered their card system was down. I couldn't order sweet potato fries since I couldn't pay with card. Food came out slower, but I predict it's their volume of orders during the lunch rush.", "author": "Christine Z."}

Vietnamese Fusion.\nIf you are looking for authentic viet sandwiches or food, this spot  is not the place for you. We came knowing it was viet fusion and it was pretty good, but nothing spectacular to keep me coming back. \n\nFOOD: \nThey offer, rice bowl, salad bowls, sandwiches and small dishes and drinks. The only thing on the menu that scream Vietnamese are the sandwiches, but other than a few viet oriented ingredients I would not know is was a viet food shop. We ordered: \n+ 5 specie chicken sandwich $8: sandwich was pretty small, had little chicken. Mostly packed with lots of veggies, specifically carrots. \n+ Caramel Citrus Chicken Rice Bowl $11: I appreciate that they have an option for brown rice :) The bowl also came with 3 slices of orange, grapefruit, some mango, avocado, carrots and your choice to meat. I thought the fruits would be a good touch to the bowl, but the strong acidity of the citrus and the saltiness of the sauce was not a good mix. Chicken tasted okay, but looked like pork. \n\nSERVICE: \nThis is a order, grab the number and sit kind of restaurant. Servers are friendly and the food comes out relatively fast. \n\nAMBIANCE:     \nLooks pretty small on the outside, but there are about 5 tables insides and plenty of bar seats in the back. There are also some outside seating as well. \n\nVerdict: Overall, decent food and I like how it's on the healthier side with simple ingredients.

The space is nice and service was quick and friendly with typical fast casual flair. \n\nB\u00e1nh mi's are one of my favorites, and while this sando had all the right components - wonderfully sweet and acidic picked veggies, hot Jalape\u00f1o, cooling cucumber, and fantastic bread - the flavor of the meat was pretty lacking. While I appreciated that it was leaner and of a higher quality than you'll find on most $5 mi's, the seasoning was pretty flat and left a lot to be desired. For the $8 price point I expected quality but I also expected a decent balance of sweet and salty that was entirely absent. \n\nThe bread tho, was stellar, with a distinct sourdough tang and big hearty crunchy outside that was good enough that I would come back and try another protein. It's uncommon to see sourdough on this type of sandwich and it was a welcome and successful change.", "author": "Sean S."}

Everything is the \"do it yourself\" afterwards. \n\nFOOD: \nThey have Banh mi, noodle/rice bowls, sides, and various drinks.  The restaurant is small and with limited seating. I went with a group and we got the pork belly, lemon grass, combo, and 5 spice chicken banh mi. Then we also got a noodle bowl. The sandwiches are just okay but nothing that impressive. It was fresh but its very different from banh mi from other Vietnamese food places. Food comes pretty quickly (~5-10 mins from the time you order). \n\nSERVICE: \nThey are a very small restaurant so many times one person basically works the cash register, wipes the tables, makes the drinks, and etc. So it may seem like they are inattentive to you the customer. \n\nOVERALL: \nA pretty good addition to the neighborhood.

I feel as though the same general sentiment applies to banh mis. The best I've had are on street carts in Vietnam for under a dollar a pop, or in the States, in a small shop nestled next to a gas station. I was hesitant when I walked into a hipster, modern, and spacious interior of Bun Mee, but I gave it a chance. I kind of wish I hadn't. And my initial hypothesis still stands. \n\nI got the crispy tofu \"bun mee,\" which contained tofu, soy mayo, shaved onion, julienned carrots, daikon, cauliflower relish, jalapenos, cilantro, and shallots. The vegetables were plentiful, which was good, but didn't taste... vinegary enough? They didn't have the characteristic sweetness cut with a tinge of acidity from the vinegar and fish sauce that one would typically expect from a banh mi.

While I appreciated the vegan options (including soy mayo), the flavors were lackluster. First and foremost, I am obsessed with vegetarian spring/summer rolls and invariably like, and on some occasions...love, spring/summer rolls from every vietnamese place at which I dine. However, the summer rolls at Bun Mee were inedible; they were filled with too many carrots and had a strange taste overall. In addition, the peanut sauce that accompanied the summer rolls was thick and tasted very bad, almost like vomit. Second, the crispy tofu sandwich was not as described. The tofu was not even close to crispy and the sandwich was loaded with those ill-flavored carrots. The one aspect I did like about the sandwich was the soy mayo and the cauliflower; therefore, I took the carrots and tofu off and ate the sandwich as so. My partner felt disappointed with his meat sandwich, the Combo. Overall, for $30 total (two banh mi sandwiches, summer rolls, and a beer), Bun Mee is not worth the cost for uninspiring vietnamese sandwiches.\n\n**PS- Be careful here too.

My goodness, this place is everything I could want in a fast, explosively tasty, healthy Vietnamese option--they have literally anything you'd want to eat: Salads? Check. Sandwiches? Check. Rice bowls? Check. Noodles? Check. We got the steak banh mi with pate, specified \"mild,\" and also got the garlic rice bowl with egg and shrimp. The sandwich comes fully loaded with pickled carrots, mild creamy pate spread, little sprigs of cilantro, bits of shredded cabbage, slices of tender steak, and likely some fish sauce piled atop a fresh crusty baguette, everything nestled here. And the bowl--on a generous mound of mildly spiced garlic rice, not overpowering, a perfectly yolked egg and grilled shrimp, large enough to deserve the \"prawn\" designation. Everything came out super fast, and the flavors were insanely explosively flavor-packed and tasty, to the point where my husband and I entered some soert of hypnotic zone, not talking, simply inhaling the food. We also got their coconut chocolate cooke and shared it. Big mistake: I should've gotten my own :-) It's a crunchy dark chocolate thin cookie sandwich and between two layers is a moist creamy coconut cream. It's not artificial sweetness or gunky; instead, like all their stuff, it's fresh and in a few bites, disappears. Yes, the prices here are more than you'd pay at a local Vietnamese joint in the tenderloin, but it's more than worth the prices because the ingredients and preparations are more refined, have a degree of sophistication and freshness that you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere. If I had one of these near my house, I'd likely sleep there :-) Did I mention--the staff is always friendly and on the ball?

My boyfriend and I were deciding on what we wanted to eat when suddenly, he said, \"I want banh mi.\" I'm just like, \"sure\", as I let him take me up the street and to the entrance of an unfamiliar venue. I looked at the storefront sign and immediately perked up when I read \"Bun Mee\". I was thinking, \"Hey! It's this place I've been wanting to try for a while now!\" You know that feeling. \n\nI walk in with my sweetheart, admiring the decor. Everything is as hip in person as it is in all of the website photos. We were impressed. \n\nWe take a few moments to look at the pretty menu board posted on the wall. I end up ordering the Bun Mee Combo; my guy orders the Grilled Five Spice Chicken bun mee. \n\nEverything is going swell. There's a cool bus boy moving about the restaurant to clean up the tables. He's friendly as he excuses himself around us. Limited space, thus he was unavoidable. It's SF, so the place is super small, of course. That's all good, though. I didn't mind that. So long as the establishment is kept clean, which it was. \n\nThe sandwiches I see other customers eating look pretty good. \n\nWe grab a table in the window nook and await our food. The sandwiches came and ours were just as pretty as all of the other sandwiches I was onlooking before. We begin to eat.\n\nThat was when... the fancy mirror started to crack. It was as if looks are all that matters to these people. Yeah, you've got a nice place. Yeahh, your sandwiches are good looking. But what about the taste, people?? At best, the sandwiches were mediocre :/. That is at best, but in my honest opinion, they were lame. \n\nThe bread did not taste fresh. It was stale and dry compared to authentic banh mi's I've had the pleasure of eating in the past. That is the biggest tragedy, as we all know... a good banh mi needs good banh mi! \n\nThe meat? Seasoned poorly! My boyfriend thought his chicken sandwich was subpar, and when I took a bite, I had to agree. My combo bun mee filling was all over the place. The pork was a weird sponge food with a flavor that didn't really compliment anything. As for the p\u00e2t\u00e9, I could barely find any, let alone taste it. \n\n(Side personal story: When I first received my sandwich, I opened up the bread, only to take my order back to the register. All that I saw was Kurobuta pork in-between the buns.\n\nIt prompted me to say to the cashier girl, \"I'm sorry. We ordered the combo, but received the pork.\" \n\nShe looked at me, shifted her eyes, looked to her monitor to read something, looked back at me, and then said, \"No. You ordered the pork. I'm sure.\" \n\nI'm a bit passive, so I took the sandwich back to my table feeling bad that I made a fuss. I talked about it for a minute with my guy, and we basically agreed with confidence that we did order the combo. \n\nIt just didn't feel right, so I took the sandwich to register again. Being mindfully polite, I said, \"I'm really sorry, but we're sure we ordered the combo.\" \n\nShe then took the sandwich to the back, as I'm now firm on receiving my correct order. A minute later, she brought the same sandwich back to me, saying, \"Oh, the chef says it is the combo.\" \n\nShe pointed to a small sliver of p\u00e2t\u00e9 that anyone would miss. I mean, I missed it. My boyfriend missed it. She even missed it herself, as she previously believed it had to be pork. \n\nThat specific part left me most confused! When the chef confirmed that the sandwich was the Bun Mee Combo all along, I couldn't understand why the cashier girl insisted earlier that we ordered pork. She made it seem like she was positive we ordered pork, and that she proved it by checking the monitor history. Was that all just an act? I think my guy said it best when she walked away. \"It's like her first instinct was just to lie.\"\n\nAnyway...)\n\nWith the stale bread and poorly tasting meat, the best part of the \"bun mee\" is the vegetables, which can only be described as plain and ordinary. Not really great adjectives to describe the best component of a meal, now is it? \n\nNo. Not great.\n\nThus, overall, these sandwiches were very lame. They were like a pretty face that draws you in, only to reveal a character that lacks depth and substance. Well, I'm not about that. Thus, in conclusion: Bun Mee? Ehh. Tap it once then pass. 2 stars just for that.", "author": "Mimi N."}

Take popular Vietnamese diner food dishes, \n2. make them seem healthy to the average White American 30s something \n3. dressed in LuluLemon Athletica yoga gear, \n4. charge double what you would find in Little Saigon for the same thing \n5. but don't use as much authentic Viet greens and ingredients,  \n6. hire Latino help to prepare your casual Americanized Viet Diner food. \n7. keep the place small and crowded to seem even more popular\n8. make a lot of money! \n\nBun Mee is Viet food meets white yuppies. \n\nTo be fair, Banh Mi is actually a derivative from the French, when they occupied and tried to colonize Indochine in the previous century. The sandwich uses a small French baguette like roll, baked perfectly for a sandwich. These became legendary at places like Lee's Sandwich shops and other similar Vietnamese establishments in Little Saigons in Westminster, San Jose, and other west coast cities. \n\nAnd also to be fair, it is Vietnamese owned. A mother-daughter team of Ms. Tran and her Mom, Ms. Truong, own and run the place. Mom is originally from Hue, the ancient capital, in central Vietnam. I asked her if the old Vietnamese saying was true:\n\n1. A girl from the North is good in your living room parlor\n2. A girl from the South is good in your kitchen\n3. A girl from the Central is good in your bedroom\n\nShe smiled and laughed! I asked her if she is from Hue, why doesn't Bun Mee offer the classic signature dish from central Vietnam, Bun Bo Hue? \nShe said that they would have to hire a Vietnamese cook to make it, and there are too many ingredients. \n\nSo if you want simple, tasty, and fairly healthy Viet diner food, come here because there aren't any authentic Vietnamese Diner restaurants near here, because the rent is too expensive. \n\nUse the magic formula, and then replicate it downtown.

My other boss goes for the Grilled 5 Spice Chicken Salad. I've never eating it myself until now, because my mom makes this stuff at home. I get it for free, mommy/home-made. I was skeptical every time I ordered the meals for my team after seeing the price and what you get. Although, I have to always remind myself Vietnamese food is way more expensive in SF, because people here are willing to pay a lot for something that's really cheap and easy to make. I'm pretty sure Bun Mee knows this and good for them. They will charge an extra $1 for extra fried tofu...good for them. I don't think they give that much more extra tofu, but I wish they would.  \n\nAnyways, besides me ranting about how I think the food is overpriced. I got to try Bun Mee for free, which is the only reason why I even tried it. I was debating to try a normal bun mi with chicken or pork, but then I saw they had a Sloppy Bun which was one of their recommended items from Yelp. I ordered that with a side of Mango Salad. The bread was soggy, but that's normal for a sloppy joe. I enjoyed the red curry flavored ground beef. There's a good amount of lemon grass flavor that I really liked about the sandwich. I had 3 sprigs of cilantro, 1 jalapeno, and 2-3 shredded pieces of pickled radish/carrot. I had to transfer this sandwich onto a plate because it was messy...something I appreciated...brings me back. The side salad was meh. For some reason, I was thinking it was going to be with spicy fish sauce...but I was tripping. There wasn't much flavor except for the mango. The cookies are different. I've never had anything like it before. My team swears they're really addicting. They're good, but I didn't care for it. It's a sweet cookie with coconut in the middle...maybe it's something where you either like or are ok with it. \n\nOverall, I think Bun Mee is overpriced for what you get. You can get bigger bun bowls and more protein elsewhere. Please note, I'm super biased when it comes to Vietnamese food.

Jamie W. had the $6.50 Bun Mee Combo, which combines roast pork, mortadella and a more upscale pate with the standard Vietnamese ingredients of onions cucumbers, and pickled carrots and daikon - all perfectly julienned - as well as jalapeno, garlic aioli and cilantro (see photo). Mine was a tad fancier and more satisfying, the $7.95 Juicy Steak, which you guessed it - contains grilled steak with the same Vietnamese ingredients plus crispy shallots, lotus root relish and lime pepper in the aioli (see photo). \n\nBut I have to admit one thing as a non-Pac Heights glutton - they seemed a mite small to me to be completely filling for dinner. Good thing we ordered the Sweet Potato Fries which came in a little aluminum bucket with a red curry aioli (see photo). Jamie was a bit miffed that we were forced to have the upscale Boylan sodas, a sure sign of elitism since they do not dare offer the dregs that represent Diet Coke. I had less issue with my Diet Cane Cola since I just needed to wet my whistle. We ended our mini-meal with a $1.50 House-made Coconut Cookie Sandwich, a sliver of a chocolate cookie dessert with an Almond Joy-type filling in between (see photo). \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...good sammies with top ingredients but really overpriced compared to the likes of Lee's or Saigon Sandwiches \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...hipster rural and quite compact \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice guy at the counter \nTOTAL - 3 stars...Bun You!", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-04", "description": "I just wasted $7 on the WORST Banh Mi ever!\n\nLet me preface by saving that I have absolutely no qualms about spending $7, $10, or even $15 on a sandwich; a good sandwich is a good sandwich period. And given that Bun Mee is a hipster, fusion type establishment located in Pac Heights, one of the most exclusive areas in San Francisco, the higher prices are to be expected. However, what I have a problem is wasting money on a poorly made and flavorless sandwich.\n\nFor those who have read my reviews, I often note that not very keen on fusion cuisine because the flavors tend to be dumb-downed in order to appeal to the general public. But lately I have been having a good streak with fusion cuisine: Curry Up Now, Bushi-Tei, Betelnut, etc, so when I saw Bun Mee on the \"Hot on Yelp\" list today, I wanted to give it a shot.\n\nToday, 4.4.11, I came to Bun Mee at around 6:05 PM. As soon as I walked in, an employee said, they were \"closed\" but then I could still order. I asked what time they normally close and he said, \"Today at 6 PM, tomorrow at 7 PM, the next day at 8 PM and eventually at 9 or 10 PM\" because they've been running out of things. Err, ok...not to sound harsh, but as a business owner, if you know you've been running out of things shouldn't you plan accordingly? It's plain commonsense, but anyhow...\n\nI wanted to order the Belly Bun (Pork Belly Sandwich) but they were out of that, go figure; so I opted for the Bun Mee Combo - Roasted Pork, Pate de Campagne, Mortadella, Garlic Aioli, Onions, Pickled Carrots & Daikon, Cucumber, Jalapenos and Cilantro ($7.12 including tax).\n\nWhen I was handed my order, juices started to soak through the paper wrapping and onto my hands which was already not a good sign. As I unwrapped the sandwich, the sandwich looked very unappetizing and sad as the only meat I saw was a slice of deli ham which was suppose to be the mortadella. Here's a pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_KtkAiwyxHbkn9O6yEMvjA?select=-jKCGO0uryFv3PBnbYUSzA\n\nOne of the essential components of a good, authentic Banh Mi is the bread; the french baguette should be light, crusty and chewy with a fluffy center. The combo of meats along with the accoutrements of the pickled veggies, cilantro, jalepenos and mayo (often egg yolk based) should pop with layers of salty, savory, tangy, sweet and sour flavors.\n\nKeeping in mind that the Bun Mee Combo was fusion based, this banh mi was poorly excuted and lacked most, if not all, of the flavor profiles that a authentic banh mi has. Within minutes, the baguette was soggy and wet in the middle. The fillings were very scant; the little roast pork and one slice of \"mortadella\" in the banh mi got completely lost in the bread. There didn't seem to be any pate or at least I couldn't taste any as there was no hint of that rich, slightly gamey taste. The very few slivers of pickled daikon and carrots there were was bland and lacked the pungent sweet and sour flavor that I'm accustomed to. Sadly, it was a bahn mi FAIL.\n\nIf you're a loyal fan and/or have tried Saigon Sandwiches in the TL (http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-sandwich-san-francisco) which is the BEST bahn mi in SF in my opinion, you will probably be very disappointed in Bun Mee's version especially for twice the cost. \n\nIf you're a Saigon Sandwich virgin and/or looking for an authentic banh mi jam packed with fillings and bold flavors, you MUST try it! For ~$3, this hole-in-the-wall will tantalize every one of your taste buds and leave you wanting more. \n\n2 stars is being extra generous; 1 star for the friendly service and 1 star for filling my belly with empty carbs. \n\nSorry, Bun Mee but I wouldn't want to \"Bun\" you again...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-30", "description": "IMHO, the most important part of a good banh mi is the bread, and Bun Mee has that part down perfectly.  The baguettes here are just the perfect texture: crunchy crust with a soft and light center.  Most other banh mi places I've tried in the area use much harder bread which takes away from the whole experience of a good banh mi sandwich. \n\nWhat's also cool here is that while you will find the traditional Vietnamese combination banh mi here, you will also find some less than traditional interpretations here.  Sloppy Joe banh mi with a fried egg?  Pork belly banh mi? Check and check!  They call them \"gourmet banh mi-inspired sandwiches\".\n\nNow, don't let the \"gourmet\" part scare you.  Sure, they are on Fillmore where rent is high.  Sure, if you compare them to the super dingy, hole-in-the-wall, traditional banh mi shops, you may think of them as expensive.

It made the sandwich much more tastier then it looked. Spice? My palate is sensative to spice and I felt like I only recieved 0.005 spice instead of 5 spice. I had wish my sandwich had more cilantro as it only had 1 stem of cilantro. The french bread was fresh, easy to eat - unlike other places the bread is too toasted (or old) where the texture is hard. I'd definately order this again.\n\nGREEN PAPAYA SALAD ($3.50) - enjoyed the papaya salad. it was very fresh and had that great kick to it that really complimented the sandwich. people may complain the blandness of the sandwich, well next time they should order this salad because its pretty flavorful and will balance the blandness out.\n\nHOUSE-MADE STRAWBERRY LYCHEE AGUA FRESA ($2.50) - oh WOW now that was a refreshing drink. I'd probably have to order 2 of these in my next sitting. I cannot explain how yummy this drink was.\n\nIf I had brought friends who grew up eating authentic Vietnamese food to this establishment, they'd probably punch me in the face.

For enjoying this chipotle-tizing of my beloved Vietnamese food. \n\nI ordered the lemongrass pork as this was the closest thing on the menu to something that would actually be on a Vietnamese sandwich.  (where's the thit nguoi btw?). I was so ready to hate it.  How dare they try to improve the perfect sandwich?\n\nAnd damn it. I liked it. It was actually good.  \n\nI think my problem is that they're calling it a Banh Mi and are charging 8 bucks for it.  I remember when Banh Mi's were $1 each!!  And yet, I have no qualms with paying $11 for sandwich from ike's which is equally as filling. I guess if they just called it a sandwich on a french baguette I wouldn't be so mad.\n\nThis really makes me think. My roommate hates Mission Chinese. He feels like it's a bastardization of his beloved Chinese home cooking. And here I am waiting in line just like everyone else for their thrice cooked bacon and pastrami.  Now I know how he feels, it's this fusion of Western and Easter tastes, clashing with my strong Vietnamese sensibilities.  I considered him too conservative, too... Old World when it came to this topic.  I said to myself, things change, things evolve.  They pick up new bits and pieces of every culture it passes through.

Yes, I took the crazy (and wildly expensive) dive to live in the Bay. Luckily, I'm enjoying this move thanks to the delicious food this city has to offer. Bun Mee has the distinct honor of being my first SF Yelp review mainly because it's one of my favorite neighborhood discoveries so far. \n\nI've known about this spot for some time, but each instance I've visited SF over the last year, I didn't have a minute to drop in. I live in the neighborhood so now I have to chance to. I went in the other night and was quite pleased with the food, the pricing, and the variety of items... oh, and I personally found the setting (and surrounding area) quite charming! \n\nI ordered the lemongrass pork banh mi, the pork belly bowl with brown rice, sweet potato fries, and the strawberry lychee drink. Now, I am well aware this is not the most \"authentic\" (this word is problematic -- sorry, it's the academic in me) Vietnamese food (as my mom reminded me repeatedly when she came in with me: \"Umm... this isn't traditional Vietnamese!\" \"HAHA I know, Mom. That's part of the point.\" \"Hmm... okay...\" \"Let's just give it a try... please!\"). Nevertheless, I liked the banh mi very much. The pork was deliciously seasoned and the fried egg (for $1 extra) added some moistness to an otherwise semi-dry sandwich. Of course, the pickled daikon, cucumber, and carrots are essential for this and they were awesome. The pork belly bowl was quite massive and a \"steal\" (at least for SF) in price. The pork belly was braised beautifully and the accompanying sides were sorta sweet and spicy. The spicy cauliflower added a fantastic \"oomph!\" in flavors. The brown rice made this bowl quite substantial and could easily be eaten over two meals or between two people. The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the red curry mayo dipping sauce completed this cheap side of fried pleasure!! The strawberry lychee drink was lovely --- though I have to admit a bit on the sweet side. It could've used a couple tablespoons less sugar or simple syrup. \n\nI liked the setting. We sat in the sorta-awkward booth facing the doorway, but I liked that we were able to watch sidewalk traffic. That's always a simple pleasure -- and free entertainment of course! In case you wanted to know the clientele: Well, what do you expect? Bougie \"hipster aesthetic\" Yuppies! (It's fine. I too enjoy my plaid shirts, corduroy, and brown suede shoes. How stereotypical of me!) The service was alright. They bring the food out to you and while they don't \"wait\" on you, I'd like a little enthusiasm or at least a smile with the delivery.

I'd heard about Bun Mee down in the FiDi and when we saw it, we figured why not go for something different and try it!\n\nDespite it being lunch time on a Saturday, this location isn't busy at all. There were a few people seated in the restaurant, a few at the outside seating, and only one person ahead of us. We ordered the Crunchy Tofu sandwich, the Lemongrass Pork sandwich, and a side of Salt & Pepper Garlic fries to share. We got our number, grabbed a seat and waited for the food to come out.\n\nService was quick and polite, and our food arrived in under five minutes. First off, the sandwiches were made to order (one without jalapenos, the other without mayo). The pickled vegetables were crisp and sour, the cilantro fresh and tasty! I loved every bit of my crunchy tofu and ate almost the entire sandwich. The only reason I couldn't finish it was due to the fries that came topped with salt and pepper and bits of jalapenos and fresh garlic. There's not a lot of garlic on them, so if you're looking for true \"garlic fries\", this isn't it, but between the various seasonings and toppings, plus the insane crispness of these fries, you're not going to care!\n\nThe price was incredibly reasonable, although definitely more than the more authentic hole-in-the-wall bahn mi places, but it's the Fillmore and Lower Pac Heights, so what else do you expect.\n\nI'm looking forward to putting this place on my list of \"places to regularly get a sandwich at\".", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Admittedly more quality meats, because anything from an unidentifiable animal part would make them balk.\n3. Really mild, unoffending, and bland flavors -- with all the wonderful pungent notes and spices of an actual banh mi being squelched for the opportunity to douse one's sandwich in Sriracha (which, by the way, I love as much as anyone else but I'm not a big fan of needing to sauce up my sandwich after I've already paid the premium price tag for you to hopefully flavor it properly for me to eat as is).\n4. To top it off, everything is served to you by a bearded hipster man or a female in plaid and Warby Parker glasses. The slightly cleaned up versions compared to Mission folks for the Pac Heights crowd, but still trendy enough so that it still feels like a cool and modern place to frequent.\n\nI'm totally not above a bastardized version of any ethnic food item if it's tasty and warranted.

In Italy, you will be forever spurned if you dare ask for parmesan cheese to splatter over your perfect Italian pasta. In America, these things are expected and accepted. This is because most traditional food from other countries becomes Americanized along its journey to the states. General American consumerism seems to require ethnically diverse foods to cater to its palate.\n\nWhat the hell does this have to do with Bun Mee you ask? Bun Mee is Americanized Vietnamese food. It is absolutely tasty, well made and a pleasure to eat, but not authentic. When you have tracked down authentic Banh Mi in the past, you know this right away. It's not necessarily a knock on Bun Mee, but something to note and something to consider in the larger picture of how ethnic food gets adjusted in America (see the long list of rolls on sushi menus with ridiculous names like Love Roll).\n\nBun Mee is an engaging restaurant to dip into off of FIllmore with very smart three-on-one-side seating with two benches in the window. You order at the counter, get a number and get your food quickly. The menu is diverse and intriguing if not authentic, but overpriced. \n\nThe Bun Noodle Bowl (Vermicelli rice noodle, Mamma Tran's crispy egg roll, lettuce, pickled carrots and daikon, spicy cucumbers, Vietnamese herbs, cilantro, roasted peanuts, and crispy shallots served with a nuoc cham dipping sauce) was excellent once you mixed all the parts together - a flavorful bowl of goodness that is unfortunately overpriced at $13.75 once you add chicken. There's just not enough in the bowl to warrant almost 14 bucks.\n\nThe Belly Bun (Braised Kurobuta pork belly, salted radish relish, shaved onion, pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber, jalapenos, cilantro) is a better deal at $6.75, but the construction of the sandwich is more assembly line than assembly for the eater. All the delicious pork belly is at the bottom, then all the dressings are on the top so unless you have a mouth the size of Andre the Giant you will be taking one bite of all pork and the next of all veggies. To make this sandwich perfect, it needs to be mixed together before and not made Subway style just following the flow chart of ingredients.\n\nWith all that said, if you are not looking to eat truly authentic Vietnamese food and are looking for a hip, quick, stomach full of some tasty food, you won't be disappointed at Bun Mee.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-26", "description": "I've been getting my banh mi fix here regularly since they opened.  I suppose it's impressive that they've barely raised their prices in this neighborhood for the  ~1.25 years they've been open, as most sandwiches are only 25c more than the early prices (and dropped a little for some other items?).  That said, lately it seems to have some consistency issues compared to the earlier days of its existence.\n\nBought a sandwich one night recently, and now I have to worry a little more about eating bread that will scrape up my mouth.  At first I thought it was stale (toasting stale bread does not magically turn it fresh; it just trades a bad chewiness for something hard that is more likely to scrape up the roof and bottom of your mouth as you eat!), but Denise the owner informed me that they get bread baked fresh every day, and that they even changed to a higher quality more expensive bread recently.  To be fair, it was around 7pm or later, so maybe the bread just gets a little drier faster than expected?  \n\nAlso, I could've sworn the sandwiches have gotten thinner over time, but I was assured that they've never changed the amount of meat in them.  If it's not that, then the workers are inconsistent.  At any rate I was fooled last week during lunch.  At first glance at the cross-section cut down the middle, a nice portion of meat is visible, ready for nomming.  But that's because it was all piled in the middle!  It was pretty much devoid of any pork for 25% of it, the lump of meat in the middle, and the remaining 25% had maybe a very thin slice of it.  I don't recall ordering a half veggie/half meat - of course, spreading out the meat would make it look skimpy for that first bite, heh.\n\nThe flavor is still good when the bread is fresh and you have meat in your bites, but now I worry that their $7.05 pork sandwich may not be any more consistent than the cheaper yet very tasty ~$4 buns you can find elsewhere around town (e.g. Fresh Brew Coffee, Sweet Aroma, Saigon Sandwiches).  As they have the monopoly on the lower priced banh mi in this part of town (Out the Door has tasty meat with a different flavor, but is way over priced at ~$13), I will still visit them on occasion, although I'm a little more wary about the evening.  The owner did also apologize for my more recent experiences, so I do want to give them the benefit of the doubt!  Curse this addiction...", "author": "Linus W."}

The catfish stood up to it's name (crispy!) and was well-seasoned, the toasted baguette did not hurt the roof of my mouth (success!) and, though extremely stuffed at the end of my meal, I still wanted a little more catfish. The pickled carrot and daikon was just ok (I like it with a little more pickle punch). The Napa salad was pretty tasty -- think Thai papaya salad but with cabbage instead of papaya. I love lots of dressing on my salads, but because they sometimes serve it on the same plate as your sandwich, this salad was way overdressed -- it made my friend's sandwich go mushy...eh.

The banh mi that I enjoy is when meat is was well-seasoned (and was delicious enough to eat on its own), was consistent throughout each bite, and didn't have pickled vegetables or cilantro or spices that overwhelmed my taste buds. \n\nFor Bun Mee, the meat quality was good enough, but the flavors/seasoning felt out of place. The ground beef (sloppy bun) was a little too salty and didn't go well with the jalapenos. Furthermore,  it wasn't well balanced, and with each bite I wasn't sure if I was going to get a big bite of jalapeno or a big bite of onion.  \nFor the pork, also way too much jalapeno, and again nothing memorable.\n\nIf each sandwich were the typical price of a banh mi (aka not fillmore prices), I still probably would not come here again.

The buns are a little tough and sometimes I feel like I'm sacrificing a layer of skin on the roof of my mouth every time I go there, but the flavors are really good. Adding avocado is tasty, but they don't give you much. As for adding a fried egg, it's really hit or miss. Sometimes they'll place it in the sandwich and it'll be a great addition. But other times they'll just haphazardly throw it half-on your sandwich, flopping out onto the tray, and you're left thinking \"how do they expect me to eat this??\" and end up with a tray full of runny egg.  \n\nBut, their rice bowls are lacking. Their old menu had a really nice variety of things in each of the bowls (I once got one with chicken, avocado, grapefruit, oranges, plus assorted veggies), but now it's just rice with some meat and assorted veggies.

Crisp veggies and mint with pineapple. I thought the pineapple was a great touch to balance out the spicy peanut dipping sauce provided. ( I love peanut sauce BTW). As for the sandwich: crunchy baguette, soft in the middle. Beautifully seasoned pork not too salty. Crisp pickled veggies. I usually don't like cucumbers without ranch but I ate every bit of it. \nSide note there was some excess oil on the outside of the bread. I just dabbed it with a napkin and was able to look past it.

I messed up and left the salad out on my stove overnight, so I didn't get to try it. Boooo me!\n\nI tried my mom's catfish sandwich and it was really good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-09", "description": "On our walk down this block, we noticed that there's a cluster of restaurants which appear to be trying to take hole-in-the wall Asian street food upscale and hip.  We passed by the expensive steamed bun shop, turned the corner at the expensive street taco shop, and finally arrived at Bun Mee ... the expensive Vietnamese Sandwich shop.\n\nWell - they actually offer some hot food as well ... but stay with me here.\n\nYeah.  It's cute.  And no doubt the rent on this stretch of Fillmore is high.  And it looks like they spent too much money on the kitchen, which takes up half the restaurant.  Apparently, I can pay up to $7.95 for a banh mi, though most flavors are a little over $6.\n\nThe flavors are not exactly normal - you can get pork belly, or smoked eggplant.  And this is where you have to start asking yourself the question - do exotic ingredients make a sandwich *better*?  Or just more expensive?  I mean, to me, a properly made, traditional banh mi is pretty much one of the best things ever, and changing it really isn't worth *more* to me.\n\nSo we came armed with a Blackboard Eats deal - $10 for $15 of food!  Or something like that.  Actually, you could get a sandwich ( except the steak sandwich ), a side salad, and a drink.  The minimum possible value for your $10: $11.  The maximum: $13.75.  This was not the deal we were looking for, or expecting.  In fact, the only way to get even close to the deal advertised would have been to get the steak sandwich, which was specifically excluded.  That was kind of rubbing it in, I think.\n\nIn any case, we got the combo and the eggplant sandwiches, shredded napa and mango salads, and strawberry/lychee agua fresca and a beer.  Beer Lao in bottles was all they had, so that's what we got.\n\nThe sandwiches were good, though we had a hard time finding any pate or mortadella in the combo sandwich.  Salads were fresh, the mango salad having plenty of mangoes.  The agua fresca was similarly good.  I have no problem with the taste or quality of the sandwich.  I just happen to like the real thing from the local hole in the wall ( or Lee's ) better.\n\nThey were not crowded at all on a Thursday evening around 7pm.  We found seats right away, and did not have to wait in line for longer than it took to figure out what we wanted to order.  Food arrived relatively quickly.\n\nWe did decide to try out their famous coconut creme cookie after dinner.  $1.68 after tax.  And after they for some reason decided that they needed my *name* to enter the cookie order.  I have never had a more complex cookie purchase experience.  The cookie is thin, and as my companion said, it's \"kind of like a coconut oreo, but more expensive.\"\n\nIn the end, it's a perfectly fine place if you're willing to pay that much for a ... different ... banh mi sandwich.", "author": "Albert H."}

Full disclosure, we didn't try their sandwiches, just an afternoon snack. \n\nI'm a stickler for good cafe su da (Vietnamese coffee) and was struck that when I ordered mine, it came to my table immediately, which made me suspect that it wasn't dripped to order, the authentic way. Already knowing the answer to my question, I inquired about the process by which they make their coffee, and was told what I already suspected, that they typically make a batch of it every one or two days. At $3.50 a glass, it's overpriced and weak compared to what the \"real\" Vietnamese places are doing. \n\nThe fried egg rolls were decent, but again, the $5.50 sticker price seemed way too high for two small egg rolls. I'm usually not fazed by overpriced food, because to me, if it's good, it's worth it. But in Bun Mee's case, it was both expensive and underwhelming. \n\nOn a positive note, the overall feel of the place was great and the use of Cafe du Monde coffee cans as chopstick/napkin holders was cute.

As SOON as I got to the counter, the blonde woman turned her back on me, (no acknowledgement whatsoever) and proceeded to flip through papers, back and forth and back and forth. Her co-worker, the only guy in the front of the house, was working his tail off and was great. But, I had to wait for him to finish with his customers because this woman was not going to do a finger to assist a customer. Oh, until he couldn't find my order and then she assisted HIM, not me. \n\nWhen we finished our meals and I needed a take out box, I went to the counter again and stood there and stood there and stood there while she ignored me AGAIN! her co-worker, the guy, who was doing all the heavy lifting, was busy serving meals to tables, something I noticed she didn't do... and finally, I just went up to her and asked her for a take out box. She was terrible. IF I owned a business and had an employee who were ignoring customers, I would write them up and have a LONG discussion. IF it didn't change, I would fire them.   I may not sign her paycheck, but I sure as hell am paying her salary by patronizing the business. Too bad that is lost on her. Hopefully, the owner reads reviews or will see her work performance and correct the situation. I sure don't intend to go back soon so that i can be ignored again.

If they wanted to be an authentic restaurant, they would've named their restaurant \"banh mi\", right? i digress.\n\nJuicy steak sandwich and braised pork belly sandwich is what I ordered, along with a bucket of sweet potato fries and momma tran's egg rolls.\n\nThe steak sandwich lives up to its name. juicy and steak-y. the steak was cooked medium rare, and for a sandwich of its kind, it's the perfect temperature, since if the meat is overcooked, it'll pull out of the sandwich when you bite into it (and I hate that!).  The flavors are bold, clean and pronounced.\n\nThe braised pork belly sandwich (add the boiled egg!) is my kind of sandwich.  Complex in flavors and textures, it definitely defines what forward-thinking Vietnamese sandwiches can inspire to be.  the aioli adds the creaminess complexity to this sandwich that balances out the richness of the pork, and the pickled vegetables provide the acidity that cuts through the richness. \n\nSince I'm used to having some shrimp chips to munch on when I eat Vietnamese sandwiches, the sweet potato fries are a nice substitution.  It actually fits the menu perfectly since if you're familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, the Vietnamese use a lot of sweet potatoes to make the traditional northern banh tom.  \n\nIt's a great spot for the pac heights area, and if you're lucky enough to score one of the tables at the window, it provides a perfect opportunity to eat and people-watch all the glamorous and upscale patrons who stroll along the fillmore (and who can definitely afford these sandwiches - so quit complaining!!!).", "author": "Lucy W."}

You def cannot order that at Saigon or Lee's and I really think that's the direction they should go in. It's awesome that you can add egg (in a few difft styles) to your sammie as well, my preference, the runny egg :)\n\nThe steak caesar salad was big portion, so that was nice to share. The steak was actually grilled beef, so that was nice, but nothing special. We also got the pork rice bowl with the garlic rice, giving that dish a nice touch. Tho, I felt the rice was a little soggy.\n\nLimeade was definitely refreshing, the strawberry lychee drink started out really good, but got too sweet towards the middle. I liked that there were bits of lychee shredded into it. \n\nWould I come back? Prolly not unless someone else wanted to check it out but I'm not against it.

I mean, I was absolutely STARVING. I was willing to eat two sandwiches just for myself, but I didn't want to be too much of a heffer, so we each got a sandwich and a salad to split. I ordered the roasted pork sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the 5 alarm chicken sandwich. For the salad, we got the Vietnamese ceasar salad with steak (or was it pork? It was so unmemorable I don't even remember, and I ate here 2 days ago. CHRIST). \n\nThe good thing about the sandwiches is that the bread is nicely toasted, and not too hard. I absolutely despise toasted bread that is so rock hard that I might lose a tooth biting into it. Anyways, the bread was good...and...that was pretty much it. I mean it's a decent sandwich. The meat is cooked well, but for nearly $7 for a sandwich that isn't even that big?! No thanks. The 5 alarm chicken sandwich was seasoned better, but don't call it a 5 alarm spicy chicken sandwich when it's not even remotely spicy. Lame.\n\nThe salad was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I think it was about $11, and definitely not worth the price. Overall, it's just mediocre food--and kinda pricey if you ask me. 2 sandwiches and a salad cost $26. NEXT.", "author": "Victoria B."}

The 'nuoc cham' dipping sauce was SO spicy--I was double dippin' all over the place b/c I could not get enough. \n* [grilled five spice chicken sandwich, $5.95+$1.50 for sunny side up egg]: love in a bun! Bread was well toasted but still soft enough that it didn't assult the roof of my mouth. 'Five spice' was not overwhelming & chicken was mostly lean. Lots of crunchy veggies, but jalape\u00f1os were not hot enough. I would definitely order again. \n* [caramel citrus rice bowl w/ brown rice & grilled steak, $11.95 & strawberry lychee drink. $2.50 for my BFF]: my amazing BFF wanted me to point out that he doesn't even like citrus & he loved the burst of orange flavor in his bowl.

This is the first time i've ever paid more than $5 for a banh mi. At $6.25, my expecations were pretty much, as high as could be.\n\nSo I will break this down objectively:\n\nBread - Very good. Light.  Fresh. Crispy crust. Soft insides. 4 Stars.\nPork - The most tender roast pork I've ever had in a banh mi. Nice flavor. Seasoned just right. 4 Stars.\nProduce - \"carrot salad\" and cilantro were stuffed inside and overflowing. A couple of jalapeno peppers added nice balance. 4 Stars.\nGarlic Aioli - Different enough when compared to mayonnaise. I like it. 4 Stars.\nValue - 1 Star. $6.25 seems a bit much when I break it down. If the sandwiches were just 25% larger, I'd be giving 4 star value. 50% larger, and it would be 5 stars.

Under-toasted, the roll was still a flaky mess; it should be soft with a crunchy outer shell but not be brittle.  The roll nearly disintegrated in my hands as crumbs rained all over my plate and lap.  I was expecting something sort of tangy, but instead the \"garlic aioli\" reminded me more of plain creamy mayo and was excessively smeared, overpowering even the texture of the pate de campagne which is a shame given the generous portion of pate.  \n\nNevertheless, I was greeted with lots of friendly smiles so I'd love to make this cheerful spot a regular check-in when in the 'hood.  Just hope they continue to develop their recipes.", "author": "Irene S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-01", "description": "As the saying goes, \"Never judge a book by its cover.\"  Well, this statement can easily be applicable to restaurants - as I, myself, fell for Bun Mee's cool, modish exterior/interior design.\n\nTo start, whoever is responsible for their marketing did a fab job at designing the logo.  You can't help but be intrigued by the bold \"BUN MEE\" sign outside their door.  Being a huge \"Banh Mi\" lover myself (the actual spelling of the Vietnamese term for bread), I had to stop by for bite (even though I was feeling full from my Yoppi froyyo). \n\nBUN MEE's chalkboard menu somehow makes a simple Vietnamese dish feel extremely trendy.  There are about 9 different sandwiches to choose from, which you can pair with a side of sweet potato fries or salad.  I'm not sure how sweet potato fries are relevant in this picture, so I refrained from ordering some.\n\nSince I love pat\u00e9, I ordered the Bun Mee Combo (with roast pork, pat\u00e9, mortadella, garlic aioli, shaved onion, pickled carrot & daikon, cucumber).  \n\nBefore even taking a bite out of it, I knew I would like it.  But boy, was I WRONG!\n\nReasons why my Bun Mee was a fail:\n- Although there were multiple ingredients piled into my banh mi, all I could taste was bread and bland pork\n- While the pork was relatively tender, it had no substantial flavor.  I couldn't taste the pat\u00e9 or garlic aioli whatsoever\n- For $6.50, it was a tiny sandwich.  At Lee's Sandwiches, you could get one almost twice as big, half the price, and with more authentic ingredients. \n\nYelpers, if BUN MEE was the first time you ever had a Vietnamese sandwich, I recommend that you try Latte Express 5, Lee's Sandwiches, or Spice Kit (a decent \"Americanized\" version of the Banh Mi).", "author": "Judy C."}

Today, I opted for the Bun Noodle Bowl which is essentially a small tong-ful of vermicelli noodles, some herb sprigs, and too much dressing/sauce (granted, I poured all of it into the bowl simultaneously expecting more noodles). If it wasn't for the additional lemongrass pork, it would have been a VERY sad and disproportional $10 lunch. However, this restaurant is in a good location, limited seating (but good use of space considering the small size of the place), trendy atmosphere, & acceptable service.\n\nIf you want a super authentic Vietnamese sandwich, I'd suggest hitting up Saigon Sandwich in the TL ($3.50 sandwich? I think yes).", "author": "Briana F."}

Sorry, no more visits!\n\nPrior to visiting Bun Mee, my rule of thumb for Asian eateries was: If there are Asians eating there, it should be decent.  However, after visiting Bun Mee (where there were surprisingly a lot of Asians for Pac Whites), I have revised my rule of thumb to, \"If there are *no* Asians eating there, it is probably not too good.\" \n\nThat said, I had high hopes for this place.  Ignoring that this is overpriced Asian street food, I wanted to love the pork sandwich.  However, it was sadly quite flavorless both times I tried it.  Here are the highlights (lowlights?):\n\n-Meat was flavorless\n-The carrots/veggies/cilantro were not vinegary or flavorful at all. Just crunchy\n-Only a few hot peppers.  No fiery kick at all.\n-Too much aioli\n\nRandom Business Etiquette: If anyone's ever done business in Asia, the etiquette is to use both hands when presenting someone with your business card.  I was reminded of this when the (caucasian) woman who handed me the paper bag with my sandwich handed it to me very precisely with both hands.  Anyone else notice this?", "author": "Caroline I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-20", "description": "Bun Mee's take on the Vietnamese sandwich is one that intrigues me greatly, and am glad that their product met my expectations, and thus worthy of 3.5 - 4 stars!\n\nLately, the store fronts of Pacific Heights (predominately up and down Fillmore) have been turning over and changing.  As mentioned, was intrigued by the fusion nature of Bun Mee's sandwiches especially because I've often said that banh mi's may be my favorite type of sandwich outside a panini.  Plus, their \"scooter\" street food menu is well balanced and not overwhelming.  \n\nIf you've read my reviews before, you know Asian fusion is one of my favorite cuisines, and I think Bun Mee does a fine job of mixing traditional Asian/Vietnamese ingredients with American ones.  Here's what my dining companion and I ordered and shared:\n\n- Sloppy bun was surprisingly good!  I didn't grow up eating sloppy joes, but I'm a fan of flavored ground beef in pockets and pastries, so why not a toasted baguette?!  The curry flavor was on point and shone with just the right amount of other ingredients: onions basil and jalapenos.  Good call not adding the traditional bahn mi ingredients such as the pickled carrots and daikon.  It's suggested to add an egg, but we passed.\n\n- Belly bun was equally, if not more delicious!  Braised pork belly was tender and seasoned well.  And in this sandwich it was a great idea to bring in the pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, jalapenos and cilantro as it added freshness and texture to the otherwise pretty heavy and flavorful pork belly.  With a boiled egg it's one helluva sandwich.\n\n- Side of green papaya salad was just okay.  While the ingredients were fresh tasting it lacked flavor and heat.  However, the sweet potato fries served with red curry aioli were crisped and season right!\n\nStaff is friendly and offer great suggestions, and space is clean and fun.  I'll likely go again with another bahn mi aficionado and try the Bun Mee combo since it's most like the traditional and one of the rice bowls or salads.", "author": "Marie B."}

My hubby and I got to check this upscale Vietnamese sandwich shop out during their soft opening. So lucky us, we got to sample almost everything on the menu! Here are some of the standouts:\n\nSloppy Bun - This one's a real winner. Think of the comforty goodness of your mom's sloppy joe - but spiced up for an international vacation and then dressed with a soft boiled egg, sweet basil and hot peppers. Ooh, yummy!\n\nSweet Potato Fries - I'm a sucker for homestyle fries, and these were awesome. Thinly cut, so as to maximize the crispy factor, but still soft inside for a great texture contrast. They have that sweet but salty combo going for them, plus the portion is huge - plenty for two.\n\nNapa Slaw - Do most people go to a sandwich shop for a salad? No - especially not when Bun Mee's bread is so exceptional... but if you find yourself in a salad mood, or just needing a little extra something, something... check out the Napa Slaw. No, it's nothing like Cole Slaw (other than that it's made with cabbage). It's more of a traditional vietnamese salad with peanut sauce, carrots and the good ol' standbys of basil and pepper. Light and lovely.\n\nFinally if you appreciate the art of presentation, Bun Mee is for you. Yes, the food is fantastic, fresh and fast... but it's also served with an eye for style. This is the kind of place you where you can take your foodie friends. They'll be impressed by the cool hipster vibe and the yummy pieces of art Bun Mee serves up.

But, the dark side is eating away at me.\n\nAfter walking up and down the street with my wife who was in shopping bliss, we decided to give this place a try.  \n\nWe've been to many banh mi places (LA, SF, SJ) so we have our preferrences.  \n\nI was sort of in sticker shock.  The point of eating banh mi is that you could get a nice quality meal for just a couple of bucks.  In many cases, we'd buy more sandwhiches for dinner if we love the sandwiches.  So, for 2 or 3 bucks, you wouldn't think twice about ordering more.\n\nIn this case, the \"combo\" was  about 6.50.  The equivalent of a \"dac biet\" or \"special\" banh mi.   I don't know, I've never paid 6.50 for a banh mi.  I saw the hipsters working the cashier and kitchen, so I thought about the overhead and the local economy.  My philanthropic side took over, so I ordered 2 sandwhiches for about 13 bucks (the other was a chicken banh mi).  As I handed over my cash, I felt slightly raped.  It was like paying 10 dollars for a beer at a game, 2 dollars for a banana at the airport, 8 bucks for top ramen, or paying  5 bucks for a cup of  joe at a specialty coffee shop (long story).\n\nThe sandwhiches were good.  They were not great.  They were not worth their weight.  The bread was not of the quality I expected for a banh mi- as I was hoping for more of a slightly chewier consistency.  It was light, and flaky, but it's all about the bread's glutanous quality that makes it taste substantial.  So, was the increase in 3 bucks there?  No.\n\nThe ingredients were there, though I was hoping for a bit more.  I don't know, maybe julienne the carrots differently?  I mean, they're marinated carrots and radishes for goodness sake.  How much more special can you make them?  Sure the cilantro was fresh, but it's cilantro.  The meat was good, but I feel that they drowned out the flavor of the meat with their sauces.  If I wanted Ike's, I'd go to Ike's.\n\nAnyhoos, it was a good experience.  I'd probably come back here if I lived in the area and didn't want to hop in my car or bus to go to the TL for some awesome banh mi.  \n\nFor now, I'll just leave it at that and not be a meany.", "author": "John L."}

He got the Sloppy Bun and I got the Smokey Eggplant (their only vegetarian bun option).  Maybe it's unfair to compare this place to the Chairman Bao Truck from Off The Grid, since I know they are different styles of buns, but Bao wins for sure.\n\nI think my main issue was that one small, cold, soggy piece of smoked eggplant with some cilantro on a tiny ass and sub-par roll was about $7.  I suppose cold is the style, but it was really unappetizing.  It was good enough to finish, though.  Their homemade limeade was very tasty, as was their coconut cookies!  Their cookies actually upstaged the bun for me, which is not good if your place has the name BUN in the title.\n\nThe other comparison I will make to Bao is that the Bao bun is actually good on it's own.  Even without their tasty tasty filling, I would eat Bao's bun on its own, it's very yummy.  Bun Mee's bun was like a small stale Subway sandwich roll, it tasted Day Old if you know what I mean.  Maybe if they got some fancier buns, warmed up my sandwich, and brought the price down to $4, I would give them four or more stars.", "author": "Kyle T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-21", "description": "Bread quality is a pretty big part of any sandwich.\n\nIn my opinion, there are two distinct types of banh mi breads in use throughout SF.\n\nType A is the light, flaky crusted, straw colored, football shaped variety that generally leaves a pile of crust shards on your plate the second you bite into it.  \n\nType B is more like a slice of a baguette.  The sort of baguette you might find at a bakery, with a hard, amber crust  and big sourdough style air holes filling up the insides.\n\nI'm partial to type B, but it tends to be the more uncommon of the two.  \n\nBun Mee uses something closer to type A, but of a slightly higher quality than that which I am generally accustomed to finding.  It squishes flat when you hold it in your hand, but the flaky crust doesn't just disintegrate.  It tastes fresher than it appears to be.  \n\nLikewise, the quality of the meats and veggies is pretty key.\n\nAt Bun Mee they have a working grill right there in the store for all to see.  They grill up the chicken and pork in big batches in front of you before chopping it into sandwich sized morsels for the assembly trays.  \n\nOffhand, I'd say that it appears that most banh mi stores grill up the meats a day in advance and microwave them up for each individual order.  \n\nFor all of this attention to detail at Bun Mee you pay a steep premium, of course.  A sandwich that would cost $4 at most places will set you back $6.50 here.\n\nIt probably doesn't hurt that there don't really appear to be any serious competitors within 10 blocks of this spot either.  \n\nI'd rate Bun Mee as the sort of place that's clean enough, and makes a nice enough sandwich that you wouldn't be ashamed to bring a date or a coworker here.  \n\nIt might not ever displace that greasy and dingy sentimental favorite of yours though.", "author": "Gopal R."}

In fact, when I walked past Bun Mee, I squeaked with delight and then took a photo as a reminder to try it. First of all, there isn't that many \"ethnic\" restaurants on Fillmore so it's nice to diversify the area. \n\nOur first attempt failed because Bun Mee underestimated how much business they would attract and therefore ran out of sandwiches and had to close early. Bummer! \n\nSecond time is the charm. Wow, business was booming and  there was a line out the door. Do not be deterred by the long line because it moves fast!  Thanks to two cashiers and four sandwich makers in the back. \n\nThe insider recommendation was pork belly bun and 5 spice chicken sandwich. I ordered the Bun Mee Combo and imperial rolls while JN ordered the 5 spice chicken sandwich and papaya salad. We typically share our food to enrich our tasty ventures.\n\nOverall, both Bun Mee Combo and imperial rolls were disappointing and was on the bland side.

Wish I could rate them a minus ten stars or something.\n\nAnd what's worse than their amazingly bad food, it is unbelievably and disgustingly over priced.  I had a peanut rice bowl w/ chicken and small side salad that costed me $17.  The rice bowl was served with just a small piece of dried tough to chew chicken without any flavor (amazingly no flavor at all) and over cooked brown rice in an artificial wooden plastic bowl.  Yes, a plastic bowl.  If it was like I was having a $5.99 rice bowl at an Asian fast food place, I wouldn't totally mind but the dish I had was $12.  Bad food plus high price added trashy food performance.  It was truly a nightmare.\n\nThere are so many Asian joints like Bun Mee in this city that use pop and cute decorations for their places and serve unbelievably bad food with high price.  And what's so funny about those places is that somehow there are always people who even line up for them - e.g. bad Thai restaurants with cute interior designs in Tender Nob etc.  There were two Marina looking like girls right next to me who were constantly saying \"It's soooooo good!

Didn't order anything that time and didn't really get an answer.  Play on B\u00e1nh m\u00ec?  But, Bun means rice noodle, right?  No noodles here.  Design was nice, so it looked promising.\n\nAsked a few Vietnamese folks for their thoughts on the place.  Most were put off by the price.  But, hey, it's Fillmore street, so not really out of line.

Noticed that the majority of the staff was not Vietnamese, there were folks who looked like owners who were; no problem.  It was hot in front of the cook tops and also loud throughout the restaurant (they had a big crush around opening).  \n\nOrdered at the cashier.  Went with a standard roast pork and a side salad (out of Mango Sesame Salad), so I got the cabbage slaw.  While waiting in the kitchen, I noticed that they were cooking up most of the meat ingredients in house.  Chatted with my neighbor at the bar about this new place.\n\nFirst, I have to say that the slaw was very good.  The sandwich was fine, but not great.  Not as good as Out the Door (the most direct competition).  Different enough from Lee's or your typical inexpensive Vietnamese sandwich place that it's not really a direct comparison.  The roast pork didn't have the pink color and distinct Chinatown flavor of the typical Banh mi joint.  In fact, the pork was a bit bland and very thickly cut.  The bread was interesting, but a bit on the fluffy side for my taste (would have liked a bit more crunch).  \n\nI should confess that I'm not an expert.

As we sat outside enjoying our caffeine fix, Bun Mee beckoned us towards its glorious hipster storefront. We were at the mercy of its aesthetic appeal, and after we had drained our mugs we somehow found ourselves bustling into the tiny restaurant, bumping shoulders with each other and everyone else. \n\nSince we already had dinner reservations, we just ordered one sandwich to taste among the 4 of us. It wasn't the most polite thing to do, perhaps, but we just had to see what the sandwich was like! The cashier didn't seem too pleased with us, but who could blame him? \n\nWe ordered the lemongrass grilled pork banh mi and sat ourselves at the bar, away from the crowds. The sandwich came out after a few minutes, and we split it into four delectable pieces -- the perfect appetizer! The french bread was excellent, as were all of the yummy pickled vegetables. My friends all loved the fattiness of the pork, and I really liked the lemongrass seasonings, though the fat was a bit of a deterrent for me personally. \n\nThough I wish the prices were more on par with other places selling the same fare, and it would be nice if the place was just a bit more spacious and had more seating, I think that the ambience and the tasty food make up for the drawbacks. I would definitely come back. Very fun!", "author": "Sam L."}

This place gets a solid 3.5 stars.\n\nThe interior is nice and clean, with a cool decor and casual feel.  There are a handful of tables up front and a row of bar seating in the back where you can watch the food preparers hone their craft.\n\nI had the 5 spice chicken sandwich and an order of tofu salad rolls.  The ingredients were fresh.  The sandwich tasted great, but like most bun places, the meat was a little scarce.  The tofu salad roll was better than expected.  I tried to order the regular salad roll (which has meat in it) but they were all out.  The peanut dipping sauce that came with the rolls was excellent.  It had a nice kick to it.  I was tempted to scoop out the remaining sauce and eat it straight.  It was that good.\n\nOverall, a cool place to eat and moderately priced for what it is.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty sandwich at a reasonable price.", "author": "Grant W."}

It's cute, modern, and stylish while maintaining it's super casual feel.\n\nFor two people, we ordered a 5 spice chicken sandwich, a roast pork sandwich, and a side of imperial rolls (total with tax: $19.11.  yikes!).  The roast pork was fine, but too delicately seasoned for banh mi.  The pickled carrots and hot peppers take over (didn't notice too much daikon in the veggie mix).  The 5 spice chicken had more flavor, but I thought it was more hot spicy than flavorful 5 spice-spicy (at a loss for words today).  Bread on both sandwiches was too soft for my liking.  The imperial rolls (2 per order) were fine, though small.  I would have liked a more traditional dipping sauce--theirs is very heavy on the lime, which didn't quite complement the meat filling.\n\nI would eat here if I was really craving banh mi and didn't want to go into the Tenderloin for my favorite sandwich place (no, not Saigon).  However, I think it's too expensive for what it is for me to eat here regularly and feel good about it, and the sandwiches have too much bread and not enough meat.  I ended up pulling off pieces of bread and not eating it.  I guess this is good for meal portioning--I definitely don't feel too stuffed like I usually do with a whole sandwich!\n\nNote: this is not a quick service place (though service is good!).

Alternatively, the wait staff and cashier (don't forget the cashier, the person who takes your order, Jay D!), might simply be forgetful, not paying attention or too caught up in the whole scene to focus on their primary work objective:  make the customer happy. \n\nHaving knocked elbows and scored a scarce table (ain't supply and demand a bitch?) we were presented with a takeaway package containing our dinner.  Instead of rectifying the mistake by taking the food away and properly plating it, our waiter apologized for the mistake and brought us plates and utensils to spruce up the inside picnic dinner we were about to eat.\n\nAt any rate, I do like the food served here and could only recommend that the front-of-house team do justice to those dedicated professionals working in the kitchen.\n\nUntil then, you might want to bring post-it notes and pen with which you can write reminders like, \"We're taking our meal here; not in the park\", \"Might you go light on the cilantro, please?\", etc., etc.", "author": "Jay D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-02", "description": "My hubby and I decided to grab an early dinner before seeing a play at a local theatre, and wanted to check out this place based on all the buzz it received.  In one word - overrated. I'll get to the food review in a sec (it was ok) but I have to rant first. The thing that HORRIFIED me was when I saw the cashier go and clean up a table after some patrons left - he wiped the table down with a rag while dusting all of the crumbs and food bits from the table onto the FLOOR.  Who does that??!  Would you do that at home?  If so, I don't care, but brushing stuff onto the floor at a restaurant is unsanitary and gross.  Note to management - please train your staff.  You're running a restaurant, not a barn.\n\nOk, for the food. Since I'm a vegetarian, my options were a bit limited. I decided on the Saigon Peanut Rice Bowl (with tofu over brown rice) and the hubby had Salad Rolls and the Belly Bun. I was a bit surprised at my bowl - it was almost all rice, with a tiny bit of the cabbage salad (which was really tasty), and about 12 daikon sprouts. The rice was slightly undercooked and dry.  The tofu was nicely grilled but a bit chewy.  \n\nMy suggestions to improve this dish - modify the ratio of ingredients that go in the bowl.  There must have been over 2 cups of rice in that bowl, and it could benefit from a bigger portion of salad, less rice.  If you prefer to cook your rice to a very dry state, that's fine, but it needs a bit more salad.  While the slabs of grilled tofu were good, either bring a knife to the table in order to cut the tofu (I ended up picking up the slabs with chopsticks and attempted to delicately nibble at it), or dice up the tofu before serving so it can be mixed in with the rest of the stuff in the bowl.  Peanut sauce was ok - the overall flavors (creamy peanut sauce, tangy dressing from the salad, pickled shallots) combined well, but everything was dulled by the massive amount of hard, chewy rice.  \n\nThe hubby said his rolls were \"ok\" and compared them to the fresh rolls at Zadin - nowhere near as good as Zadin (no one does those better!).  His sandwich was also ok - he's willing to go back there and try another sandwich, but he'll have to go by himself because I don't think I need to go back.", "author": "Usha M."}

I'm actually jealous that it is not in my neighborhood but thankfully Pac Heights isn't too far away.\n\nBun Mee takes an old standard, the Vietnamese sandwich, and does it well.  On my first visit I was able to try two of their sandwiches.  I ordered the sardine sandwich (after seriously considering the pork belly sandwich for a good five minutes) and my fiance ordered the roast pork sandwich.  Both were good but I would have to say that the roast pork was better than the sardine.  The sardine sandwich could have had more flavor, I actually added hot sauce to mine, and could have been served warmer.  By comparison, the roast pork was juicy and tender and full of flavor.  \n\nBun Mee's bread was beautifully toasted and very soft.  Unfortunately, it was a bit cold by the time my sandwich was served to me.  The pickled radish and fresh chili contained within both sandwiches was delectable.\n\nWe paired both sandwiches with a side of sweet potato fries served with Bun Mee's house made aioli.  The fries were perfectly fried and the aioli had great flavor.  \n\nI washed all of this down with a glass of house made kaffir limeade which was excellent and achieved a perfect harmony between tart and sweet.   \n\nI'm looking forward to my return visit to Bun Mee and their Pork Belly sandwich.

The food is just too flavorless and bland. You don't do chicken breast, you need to do chicken thighs and where's the nuoc mam? The pickled veggies need to taste like they have been actually pickled. It was a terrible and tiny sandwich for $7. \n\nSave your money, and head over to Saigon Sandwiches where the ladies don't have you stand around and wait, where you can get 2 sandwiches for the price of this overpriced one, and the sandwiches are as good as what you can get in San Jose (where really good Vietnamese food is).", "author": "Debbie A."}

Sorry, I haven't eaten bread in three years for dietary reasons, so there's no way I would have ordered a pork sandwich.\n\n\"But there is no pork salad!\"  he said.  Strike two.  Then I told him why would there be an option for other meats on the salads if I couldn't get a grilled pork salad?

I'm pretty sure that was the point. \n\nThat being said, it is a solid establishment with several pros and cons. \nI liked the sandwhich I got which was the combo. I also tried the pork belly sandwhich was very good as well. The bread they use for the bahn mi is very large and crusty --- just how i like my bread to be. I give it props for not digging into my palate like most breads do. I was a little bit underwhelmed by the spread on the sandwhich. I'm used to them putting that thick buttery creamy stuff on it. There seemed to be a little bit of dead space in the sandwhich, which I guess is pretty common for a banh mi, but maybe it was just because the bread they use is so large that they don't have enough to fill it with. \nI also tried their imperial rolls which were very good! Packed full of meat and served with lettuce, mint, pickled carrots and dipping sauce. The dipping sauce didn't taste like the normal fish sauce... a little off, but still good. I thought the imperal rolls were better than ones you'd find at your nomal vietnamese pho restuarants. \n\nLet's be real here, this place is a pretty big hit with the non-asian folk. I found myself in a sea of non-asians for the first time in .... i dont even know when. I love the idea of this place --- trying to modernize a seemingly vietnamese dish. But I'm torn... as an Asian, I still feel like I can get a better and cheaper sandwhich at many spots in the city (although you may compromise the cleanliness, but that's a different story...) . I give it 3 stars because the taste was pretty good, but more can be done to improve the sandwhiches.", "author": "Tim B."}

It'd be completely inconvenient to hop on Muni and go to the Loin just to keep it real.  \n\nI've had the grilled pork banh mi a few times and thought it was great every time.. the ingredients are quality.

I wanted a roasted pork sandwich, but they're out by 4:30 that afternoon, fine, i'll just get another one and come back and try the roast pork next time, no problem. So i ordered the 5 spice chicken instead. It not only took us a long time to get the food, one of my friends' order was lost and he wasnt getting his catfish sandwich for a while until he noticed someone behind us has already gotten his order. My friend basically had to go up to the counter and asked for his sandwich for them to realize he even ordered a catfish sandwich, sad for the business's disorganization. \n\n2nd of all, my chicken was UNDERCOOKED! the first bite of my chicken sandwich was pretty delicious, but the 2nd bite was disgusting because i chewed on a piece of undercooked  chicken and literally spit it out because i was so grossed out by it. and when i actually opened up the sandwich, i saw another couple chunks of undercooked pinkish chicken, i was pretty annoyed of course, so i had to talk to the girl behind the counter and she made the kitchen make me another sandwich and gave me a plate of papaya salad for free as a compensation in addition to her apology. I'll give her props for trying to resolve this issue the nice way to ensure customer's satisfaction. However, my chicken sandwich never came because apparently no one remembered to make my chicken sandwich, and i was just sitting there with my friends waiting and watching the cook grill meats (they have these counter seats where you can see the whole assembly line of each sandwich they make). after talking to the counter girl again, she then realized no one made the sandwich for me and she had to make it herself. after i finally got my sandwich, the bread was not toasted so it's soft all around, that to me was very disappointing because one essential part of a good banh mi is the crusty french roll. first my chicken came undercooked, and now my bread was undertoated, it really ruined my 1st impression with this place\n\n3rd, there's probably a reason why i always hear people say \"you dont wana know what goes on in the kitchen in a restaurant\" because just by sitting at the counter where i could see the cooking process, i was already grossed out and started to question the quality of the cook. for example, the guy who's grilling the chicken, he first touched the raw chicken and steaks with his gloved hands, and later on he grabbed some fries into a togo box with the gloved hands that touched the raw meat instead of the tongues he's supposed to be using, uhhh, talking about being good with sanitation. that is NOT how you serve food, uncooked meat should NOT come in contact with cooked food in any way! \n\noverall, their sandwich is not bad, but i definitely have a lot better ones in the city. and being a 6-7 dollar viet sandwich, i would actually expect more than just the long wait, undercooked meat, and improper food handling, dont you think?\n\nPS. i will give it a month to get over the learning curve and see if they've  worked out the kinks and i'll update after that. hopefully the next time i return my experience will be better", "author": "Joyce C."}

I also have to recommend the housemade Kaffir Limeade. I'd like to say it's the best Kaffir Limeade, but honestly I've never had one before. You should still try it though, as you won't regret it. There's a good amount of people piling in during lunchtime, but the wait isn't long.  \n\nside-note: I \"think\" they're also selling T-shirts, since they have a bunch of orange cans behind the counter that say \"TEE-SHIRT\".

I am from the east and never had a Vietnamese sandwich before moving to San Francisco. A friend of mine took me over to lil Saigon on larkin and that's where I've always gone, to be honest I never quite knew what was in the sandwich except what kind of meat I was having. Now that I have had bun mee I actually know all the produce that is in the sandwich and the sauce on it, never knew I was eating diakon?  Well I took an order to go a few days ago and I have now had it 3 nights in a row, it's sooo addicting, I am a sandwich gal, I could live on sandwiches and they are so affordable, really there's not too many sandwiches that are 6-7 dollars. I tried the chicken and the pork and I loved em both. I actually got the sweet potato fries with the sauce, I would actually love you to package that sauce I ate the leftover with plain chips and it was delish. You could package that and sell it to go.  Americans love that creamy slight spicy sauce on everything. I also had the egg rolls and they were sooo good.  You could eat the order by yourself.  I used take out all 3 days and my order was done fast and everyone was nice, maybe I'll dine in sometime, I like the atmosphere.

Although Bun Mee is definitely not the typical Vietnamese sandwich, I really appreciate the twist on the Vietnamese sandwiches.  I can go elsewhere for great traditional Vietnamese sandwiches, but those places don't have the sloppy joe with a side of crispy sweet potato fries.  :)  I'm deducting a star because while the sloppy joe is my favorite, I think their other items range from good to average and it's a bit pricey.\n\nAs a side comment regarding the other reviews about this place:\nIt's true, you can get a great sandwich at Saigon for half the price, but I see it as two different restaurants completely, specializing in two different things.

Any random Vietnamese place makes better bahn mi and noodles. Previously, I did say I enjoyed their customer service. Tonight was not the case. We ordered one sandwich and one bun bowl. It took 45 minutes, while three people who ordered behind us got their food before us. Customer service was crap. No apologies or explanations were offered. They just looked around nervously without even addressing the issue or offering an apology. It was appallingly bad customer service. Oh, and a line cook wearing nothing but a sports bra is pretty unappealing. Their sweat can easily fall into your food. To top it off,our food was cold, soggy, and pretty disappointing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-02", "description": "Let me start by saying that Bun Mee is a welcome addition to Fillmore St.  There are other French and other Vietnamese restaurants nearby however none of them specializes in the unique sandwiches offered by Bun Mee.  \n\nI visited today (Opening Day +1) for lunch at about 1pm with my girlfriend.\n\nAs far as decor, the restaurant has a clean open feel to it and a very legible simple menu.\n\nPerhaps it was growing pains but the 30 minute wait for a sandwich seemed a bit excessive.  \"Made to order\" sounds good in principle but given the simplicity of the menu, it seems a little absurd.  If they were to prep at least some of the ingredients in advance, they could shorten this time.  I observed many patrons departed without ordering as soon as they heard about the long wait time -- not good for the income of the restaurant!\n\nNow to the food.  I ordered the \"juicy steak\" sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the citrus rice bowl with chicken.  My sandwich was good, but not great.  The vegetables and meat were fresh and cooked well however the flavors were not as interesting or as complex as those you might find at Out the Door, Slanted Door or Heaven's Dog.  That said, I would order it again.  My girlfriend's dish was incorrectly prepared which was a little disappointing after the long wait.  To be fair:  the staff was extremely polite and understanding.\n\nOne area of improvement would be at the front register.  The attendant was not very familiar with the food's ingredients, did not know they were completely out of certain items (the reason my girlfriends dish was wrong) and forgot the drink portion of the order.  It seems like the owners and operators have placed all of their best people in the back cooking and running orders while the front isn't well nailed down.\n\nPricing is very fair although you might have to add 30-60 minutes of parking ticket charges to the bill -- an $8 sandwich is a value, at $11 it is not.\n\nNormally the long wait for a botched order would be a reason not to return however the extremely attentive response from the staff combined with some sympathy for their early days would lead me to give it another shot.\n\nI really do hope this place succeeds....", "author": "D G."}

The pork and chicken needed more marinating- lacking in flavor. The tofu was ok. They should consider marinating the tofu with something other than soy sauce or cooking with lemongrass - and mine was missing cilantro - maybe a fluke, but it's a key ingredient and I missed it. I would probably give 2.5 stars if I could. The bread and pickled carrots was good at least.", "author": "MyHanh H."}

First, I had the 5spice chicken sandwich - it was good, but didn't have the tangy juice associated with this type of sandwich, and had TONS of hot peppers on it - plus it was $6.25 - now I know, if I want a good Banh Mi, go back to Civic Center area and get it for 50% less!  Second, we also ordered the sloppy Joe Banh Mi - it was the worst - a little smear of meat, no red curry taste whatsoever, and again TONS of red peppers.

Their sandwich/banh mi selection is amazing - there's something for everyone, ranging from chicken to tofu to pork to fish to beef. My friend and I split two banh mis, one pork and one catfish. Both were soooo good, but I preferred the pork one while my friend liked the catfish. They give all the Vietnamese fixins with it: carrots, the pickle stuff, etc. It totally tastes Vietnamese, but it is by no means authentic. It definitely has a Western/Americanized flavor to it, so be prepared to expect that. The bread the sandwich is served on is very good, and every sandwich is about $7-9.

I finally went and had mixed thoughts. I ordered the Sloppy Bun (curry ground beef) which was about $6. That's pretty solid for a sandwich on Fillmore, but their drinks are all $2.50+, even for a soda so you'll end up spending $10 or more. The ingredients were definitely fresh, and flavors were good. My biggest complaint had to do with quantity. I felt like my sandwich had no meat in it, it was almost all shaved onion and aioli. I sat by the bar, where you can see the ingredient cheat sheets they have for their employees for all of their sandwiches. The sloppy bun said \"3oz sloppy joe meat\". That would be why my sandwich seemed light. If I go back, I'll try another one of the sandwiches. The 5 spice chicken looked like more care went into seasoning the meat, and perhaps the quantity is a bit higher. One other gripe those of you that like spice... I ordered the 'spicy' version of my sandwich, and it definitely wasn't. It was covered in jalapenos, but those little guys tasted as hot as a yellow bell pepper. Not sure why. My coworker said the same thing. He can't handle spicy food, accidentally got his covered with jalapenos, and he even thought it was mild. \nI also ordered the vietnamese iced coffee. This was tasty and larger than the ones you would get at my father's kitchen. But they aren't made fresh, it was poured from a large pitcher.

I come here often but they are new so still trying to figure some things out.  I really like the simple sandwich's. I generally get the five spice chicken.  The only thing is the pricing is a little off for the sides.  The sandwich's are ok priced but the problem is with the sides.  The fries are additional 3 dollars and come on the same plate that barely fits the sandwich.  For the fries it is about 15 of them.  They should just increase the price of the sandwich and add the fries or salad or give you a realistic amount for 3 bucks.\nI came for dinner to grab a rice steak bowl which was good but the brown rice was undercooked.  I finally asked the waiter and he went back and checked.  It was hard and he apologized and tried to give me a coconut cookie.  I don't do coconut.  He then brought me a side of white rice.

Its a lil' bit pricier here due to location but I had the Bun Me combo with egg and it was very good. I was impressed about the flavor they got with the grilled pork, warm, good char level, and a bit unctuous. The organic fried egg was cooked perfectly which enabled it to ooze a bit and congeal on contact with the perfectly toasted bread. Pate used was very fragrant and very savory. Enjoyed the egg rolls here. They were done perfectly and almost brimming with pork. Very good place with a cozy interior and very good flavor. I'd come again when in the area but the flavor can be gotten at any good banh mi joint in Ctown or Little Saigon.", "author": "Peter H."}

The pork in the belly bun was perfect with the seasoned veggies, hard boiled egg and the garlic aioli (which I might have stolen from my husband's sandwich) made it divine. The bread was perfectly toasted. My husband ordered the Bun Mee combo and loved the varied meats. He devoured it as I did my sandwich. My 2-year old couldn't get enough of Mama Tran's crispy egg rolls and the sweet potato fries. The fries were tasty and perfectly salted. Loved the d\u00e9cor, music and overall ambiance.

The meat was grayish in color and chewy.  Plus, it was bland.  I asked for them to add a fried egg thinking it would be nice and runny.  Nope...wrong again.  Instead of cooking the egg quickly in a hot pan so that the yolk stays soft, they put it in the oven so that the yolk cooked all the way through.  Not a hint of yummy runny yolks in sight.  My friend ordered the papaya salad and it was such a sad plate of wet, soft shredded papayas with what i think were vermicelli noodles.  WTH?  Vermicelli noodles?  Seriously?  The decor was nice, but really that's the only good thing about it.

Walking the Fillmore, (the good parts) and pass by this place. Craving a Bon Mi sandwich we decide to pop on in. The decor was nice, nice art and we liked the aesthetics and surroundings with the decor on all the walls. But hey, we're here to eat right? We order the Chicken Bon Mi sandwich no sides and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee for me. The sandwich was ok, it had good flavor, the pickled carrots and daikon were just right and the chicken had good flavor and the price was ok but a little high. If I were to order some fries and a regular drink, we'd probably would get out of here for over $20 bucks for both of us combined. We gotta remember, if Vietnamese food is even relatively expensive it has to bring something else besides the regular flavors. It has to be a step above regular Vietnamese food and this wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special like \"ahh Bun Mee, gotta have it...\" This place is like a Vietnamese Chipotle just streamlined and catering to folks in the need but haven't explored around the city to get a cheaper and equally flavorful sandwich. The iced coffee wasn't bad but it was a little too sweet and like I stated before, nothing too spectacular. Give it a shot and it may be for you but I know of other Vietnamese sandwiches that just hit the spot and is very good on price.
