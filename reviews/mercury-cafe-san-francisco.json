Yeah, the guy with the tin porkpie hat with the little wings glued on it. Anyhow, there is some point of irony I was trying to make about speed not being an atttibute of the customers who park themselves in here as they are generally individuals focused on their laptop screens, not making human contact, and barely making any movement (photo: http://bit.ly/2CfH1xR). Speed? It was more like a still life that was slightly breathing. The barista, however, was fleet of finger in her successful effort in making a solid $4 Cafe au Lait (photo: http://bit.ly/2NgAkQg). Since I didn't want to interrupt the still life inside, I took advantage of their parklet which bore only the slightest hint of auto fumes from the constant traffic on Octavia. Hell, I liked it there.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...very smooth and rich\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...probably not zombie enough for indoor seating but I'm good in the parklet\nSERVICE - 4 stars...the barista was kind and capable of human contact\nTOTAL - 4 stars...just the right corner spot for a coffee break\n\nRELATED - Looking for dining options in Hayes Valley?

Listen, I can eat my share of meat but I figured I would give this non-deli and vegan option on their menu a try (after all, I'm in SF). Absolutely excellent decision. The red peppers were so creamy and delicious, and the whole wheat bread was thick, soft and oh-so-good. I found out the owner gets his bread from Acme nearby almost daily! Finished it off with a neat cappuccino which was a punch of bittersweet\u200b coffee and had a solid espresso in it to wake me up to do some work. \n\nOverall, a solid cafe with low noise and an excellent spot to grab lunch, a coffee, and just chill.", "author": "Emily C."}

I ordered iced tea and avocado toast (basic, I know), the iced tea is okay but the avocado toast is really bland. They could improve by adding a thin layer of spread. It's just sourdough toast topped with avocado. A little onion and olive oil. I tried to sprinkle lemon juice on it from the lemon wedge that came with it, no effect. I could have done better if I were to make it at home. It just feels like not much thought is given to it. Plus the AC is not strong enough for a warm day. I think 3 stars does it justice.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Other than that this was a no-frills cafe that I don't think I'll be back to visit regularly. \n\nI ordered a chai latte. I liked that it was different (much spicier) than your average coffee shop chai.  \n\nI forgot being Martin Luther King Day that the library would be closed, which is where I had planned to get a little work done. I tried to hit up another coffee shop and they too were closed. I almost gave up and was on my way home when I found this place on Yelp. I appreciate that Mercury was open but it was a pretty lackluster experience. Staff was friendly and it's entirely possible they weren't expecting as much business as they received this day (all the tables were full) however they were incredibly slow. They have lots of seating but it wasn't super inviting, felt a little awkward and cramped. They do offer food, not sure I'd try it after watching them make sandwiches without gloves (maybe that isn't a health violation in San Francisco). I just can't imagine they were diligent about washing their hands after touching the register, collecting dirty dishes and making food. \n\nMaybe it was an off day and I should give them another shot but I'll be sure to check out some other places in the mean time.", "author": "Tarah P."}

Haha) I was looking forward to checking out Mercury Cafe because it looked beautiful and airy with a high ceiling and lots of natural light. However, besides the lighting and the neat rustic door, I encountered a series of unfortunate events:\n\n- There's a frickin PIGEON that nests in one of the lamps. I very genuinely detest pigeons aka flying rats, and this one was flapping its wings all over right on top of the tables! As if that weren't bad enough, it brushed off all the dust, feathers, and various disgusting things that accumulate in lamps, and you could actually see a shower of debris in the middle of the cafe. A dead bug and a dead spider landed on my laptop -___-;; At least I hadn't gotten my food or coffee yet.\n\n- I wanted a bagel with hummus and they ran out, so I got tomato instead. I had expected some type of spread, but it was literally just a bagel with 3 slices of tomatoes and a small sprinkle of pepper. What a waste of the extra $2... I could have gotten an entire local organic gluten-free tomato from the farmer's market. (I believe it was $2.25 for the bagel + $2 for the tomato) At least the pigeon wasn't moving around as I was eating my overpriced tomato bagel.\n\n- There were quite a number of flies; I'm not sure if there's a garbage dump nearby or something. A fly kept landing on my leg as I was eating my overpriced bagel, and I couldn't get it to go away--I must have looked like I had restless legs syndrome. \n\nThat's my rant of exasperating issues; everything else was rather standard for an SF cafe--friendly hipster-ish barista and decent coffee (except I can't say I was too excited over the $0.25 extra charge for iced drinks). Mercury Cafe has a nice neighborhood cafe vibe, but the pigeon, the flies, and the tomato bagel disappointments were too out of this world for me.", "author": "Edna C."}

On my way to the bathroom, I get yelled at \"This is a hot pan!\" by a young person with green hair carrying out fresh scones.  Fine, people get stressed.  I'm in the bathroom for two minutes and I keep hearing the barista shouting out my latte is ready.  She looks annoyed when I arrive to pick it up.  I then sit and wait and wait and wait for the bagel.  The green hair person returns to the front, looks at the food orders lining up, and goes into the back.  Maybe they prepare the food there?  At least someone knows they're waiting.  After 10 minutes with no food coming out to anyone, I return to the counter and am told that \"She's working on the avocado toast right now.\"  Sure enough, the barista is now prepping food.  Okay, must be someone else's order.  I want to ask for a refund and get back to work but I'm trying not to be a bitch, so I wait.  Avocado toast gets delivered.  Counter guy is now in the back.  Barista is making food while greenie stands next to her, crying, about who knows what.  I go up to cancel but then see my bagel is cut, tomato is sliced, just needs cream cheese and assembly.

Characters are near constantly buttering scones and gorging themselves on the flaky crumbly goodness and I can't take it anymore. I need a scone rightthisfuckingsecond.\n\nYelp tells me that Mercury makes a great scone. There are tons of reviews with people raving about these amaa@@aa@zing scones, but I'm thinking they're maybe a little nuts, because how good can a scone actually be? If there was an elementary school play put on about baked goods, the scone's only lines would be \"Oh no, I simply couldn't! I am but a humble scone!\" \n\nI go anyways, the craving can't be denied.\n\nThey pull out a fresh batch right when I arrive, I sit down with my scone and a chai, and that's it for me. I'm done. I was doing that combination of scarfing because it's so good and eating obscenely slow in order to savor it. It's warm, it's perfect, with fresh bits of strawberry hiding in its pockets. I am losing it over how good this thing tastes. The crust is crumbly and perfectly sweet, the insides are just ohhhhhh, words fail me. This is the scone to end all scones.\n\nThe sweet and dirty iced chai also comes highly recommended. It has a slight spiced kick to it, which is perfect. It's actually similar to how chai is supposed to taste, with none of that saccharine nonsense you see in most coffee shops. I polished these two guys off in 10 minutes flat, and then grabbed a second scone to go. Already looking forward to popping it in the oven and having it for afternoon tea in a few hours.\n\nTo summarize: get the scone, get the chai, ignore me in the corner tripping out over how much I fucking love my scone.", "author": "Dede G."}

So I ordered tea because lately I'm lactose in tolerant when it comes to milk and I also ordered one of their freshly baked scones which was bomb diggity! Nice and soft and warm!\n\nThe cafe itself is very spacious and has good seating. My boyfriend ordered a caprese sandwich which was $10 and good but way over priced! It wasnt the best I've tried but it was decent. He also ordered a latte and that wasnt too strong and had a great taste so I was pleased with that. \n\nMy yogurt was straight up greek yogurt and tasted like sour cream with some granola and blue berries.

If you order it \"for here\", they serve it in a big ol' pint glass. I asked for mine with soy milk, and the barista kindly obliged.

It's a quaint, cozy spot just off Octavia Street, a hop, skip, and a jump from Civic Center or Van Ness. They also offer some vegan soups and possibly sandwich options.

Very relaxed environment free Wi-Fi is a plus and the main draw in addition to proximity. I appreciate their true independent cafe status, which signs all over are quick to point out. The staff is always friendly and pleasant. My main complaint is with the tea selection. I cannot comment on coffee as I am not a coffee drinker. It's probably decent... I don't think a cafe can survive in this town without decent coffee. I digress, the tea selection is bagged Stash brand teas. \n\nThis is a general gripe for a lot of cafes from me so please don't feel singled out, dear Mercury Cafe. But why oh why do cafe's think that serving what amounts to be the Folger's coffee of the tea world is acceptable? As an avid tea drinker I implore you to find a better tea. In general it tastes like, well, nothing. Additionally, Stash Tea is not local. If you want to serve amazing tea from a local supplier, then there are options! Really good options! Delicious loose leaf options that won't make this tea lover cry on the inside when she is asked to shell out $2.50 for a mug of dark, hot water with a bag floating in it (I mean, let's be real that bag of dried flavorless plant matter cost you $0.10 at MOST and I wouldn't even care if it tasted good, but it doesn't... $2.50 is pretty steep. no pun intended. ha!). \n\nIf you change this one thing about your cafe this tea lover would be a most devoted tea drinking customer. I would even stop moping about the fact that you charge $7 for a bowl of granola. I get it, I get it, it's organic and local. yada, yada, yada. In fact, I would even go as far as to end this review on a good note-- I like the music in here and in all of my visits I have never heard anything even remotely as terrible-sounding as whales dying. I mean, most of it I'm not going to go out of my way to listen to or buy BUT I appreciate hearing the musical meanderings of the staff while I work...and sip my flavorless tea as my heart weeps inside my chest. Ha. Sorry I couldn't resist. \n\nAnywho, this cafe is a great place to work and I will keep coming for that reason. Maybe I shouldn't tell you that... I mean, I'm taking a stand against bad tea. :P Ok, I think you get the point.", "author": "Meagan M."}

At any rate, some of these folks seem like they don't care a whole lot - stuff like service, cleaning tables, doing basic things like preparing your drink in the order it was received even if it's as simple as a mocha. I get it - you have to stir the chocolate in the espresso and it takes longer than serving a cup of tea. That's not a commentary on your job, I'm just not sure it takes 5 minutes to eventually get around to my mocha when there's no one else you were helping and when I walked in you were leaning against the counter listening to the really cool punk music.\n\nBut you can only be so frustrated with ordering a mocha, right?

The staff is tatoo'd and hipster'd to the appropriate degree, and not a shade more.\n\nSomething I'd tell an earlier me, other than 'Don't move to Portland,' is that love gets harder as you age.    Or at least my experience of loving has.    When you're 25, your prime dating years yawn like an abyss in front of you, and all is easiness, and worn copies of 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' read naked,  maybe with a fresh cup of coffee, to boot.\n\nBy comparison, dating in your 30's is like an Excel spreadsheet.    Do I detect in this person's smile the fatal glibness that ruined X?   Does this person's ambition foreshadow another fruitless year-long-chase like with Y?   That this person wants children so badly-- is this another taste of Z's incessant clinging to expectation?    How much can I expect this person to contribute, realistically, to household finances?   Do they seem to value their health?   Do they understand 401(k) investment strategies at a competent level?   Why the odd fixation on Polish food?\n\nQuesions on questions, memories of memories,  and you have to fight all of this while being charming and answering questions and appearing fresh-faced and optimistic and present and pleasantly self-depreciating (because us slightly older folks can spot a poisonous narcissist a mile off) and all of this in real time, with no breaks.\n\nSo you can see why I insisted on having an ad-worthy stage for this particular drama.    Mercury did not disappoint.    The iced Americanos were deep, and cool,  and rich,  like a cup full of the Amazon night right there in front of you.   The staff were attentive but got the 'first date' vibe and kept their distance.     There was no rush.\n\nI caught my eyes in reflection on the way out the door, when it was over.    They were the eyes of a disappointed person.    \n\nI did not call or text, as is the privilege of cowardice.   She got the message.\n\nThe long and tedious task of lining up the next one begins anew.    I think I'll use the Mercury as my control location.

I moved to the neighborhood recently and this little spot just struck me as ... well home. A few big tables and a bunch of little tables, free wifi, good selection of coffee. It's a little slow but I come here to chill out after work and work on stuff. You can also grab a beer and a sandwich. Sandwiches are a bit pricey but tasty. I have had the roasted red pepper (basically a bunch of humus some roasted red peppers and some greens). It was quite good. Their scones are pretty good as well. Overall a great place.\n\nThey take creditcards but prefer cash, as their sign says. I think this is the nicest sign that says, \"Hey we get charged a fee everytime you make a credit/debit purchase, so please don't take 3% of our coffee sale\" I got to give them props for being polite about it :)", "author": "Greg G."}

One huge bonus is the abundance of power outlets for laptops and the free Wifi with no password. So, it had that going for it before I ever ordered.\n\nI ordered the vegan chili with chips and guacamole. It was 7.50 and very filling and tasty. They warned me that the guac was spicy and the guy who was making it talked about how he burned his hands on the jalapenos. So, bonus points for the warning and for the super fresh and spicy guac. I'll definitely be stopping in there more often.\n\nNext time I think I'll try the red lentil soup or maybe the roasted red pepper sandwich. They both sound delicious.", "author": "Robert M."}

This place gave me mixed feelings.\n\nThe food: Ok so far I tried a sandwich that came with mixed greens. The holiday. It was ok nothing special, but that stood out, it's a cafe and they don't specialize in it.  The coffee was tasty strong but not super bitter. 3stars\n\nThe staff/service: The service is avarage, they're nice, they great, but are not very attentive. The music like was mentioned in another review is a mixed bag of genres depending on the barista, which is fine cause I like different types of music. But it was blasting!!! It felt like a club rather than a cafe, I could barely hear my own thoughts. I'm here trying to work, read or even talk to someone next to me I shouldn't have to be yelling.  The owner/manager should let the barristas know what the maximum music blasting level should be. When I asked him to turn it down, he seemed annoyed, and turned it down a bit. I sat down and had to politely ask him to turn it down again, which he did, it's still a bit loud. I shouldn't feel like it's unpolite to ask him to turn it to a reasonable level like they have it at most cafes.  I could hear it through my headphones. He wasn't rude but wasn't happy about my suggestions, the guy with the long brown hair could learn to be more aware that it's not a club/bar. He did turn it down more when he noticed I was on yelp haha. There was a girl barrista last time I came that was playing different music but didn't blast it as much. 2star \n\nThe ambiance: The seating is average, lots of little tables packed in together. The art and arrangement is ok. It looks a bit old and worn down, it could use a good cleaning and a paint job. Overall it's a good spot to sit at and work on but again without blasting music, and a bass that makes my chair vibrate. I liked the music but not the loudness. The place looks meh. It has outside seating which is nice a bit addition so they get, 3stars\n\nI'll give them another try and see if they improve. This is all things that they could use to improve their business and bring more customers. I'm sure people get turned off when things like this happen.", "author": "Juan C."}

Great chilled vibe that doesn't distract from your work. One caveat: the WiFi, while free, is paint-dryingly slow.\n\nFood and drink here is good quality, and more or less your standard organic fair-trade coffee shop fare.

Along the side there is a long bench that flanks about seven small tables, along with four other small tables off towards the center (that makes about eleven small tables). Each of these small tables comfortably seat one person's laptop, drink, and other work, though some of them have an extra seat so that two people can cram in. There aren't enough outlets here if it gets packed, but you'll most likely be able to get access to one of the plugs.\n\nOverall: Great service, great study cafe, but the coffee I could be better and cheaper.

The combination of the natural light, white walls and wooden seats and tables make a great work-from-home, studing or reading atmosphere.\n\nThe coffee is single drip and I recommend the one that has hints of cherry. I forget the name, and I could barely taste the cherry, but the overall flavor was tasty (as suggested by the Barista when asked what her favorite one was).\n\nThere IS free wireless but it was somewhat spotty the day I used it. I think I lost signal every 20-30 minutes. Not the end of the world, but if you're doing anything where that might interrupt your work, you might want to invest in Xanax.\n\nThe only downside (and this con is more for me, not universal) was the selection of coffee condiments. With only milk, 1/2 & 1/2, and soy as options and no Splenda in sight, I was left without being able to create my ideal cup.", "author": "Jared S."}

The environment was very chill like any other cafe. Everyone seems to come here for a cup of coffee and a place to sit to work on their papers lol. It's a nice place to just sit and talk.\n\nSandwiches:\nTuna - Pretty good\nSalami - Pretty good\n\nEach sandwich comes with a side of salad topped with balsamic vinegar. I thought the vinegar was a nice touch to the salad. I probably  had better tuna sandwiches elsewhere but overall it was still pretty good. I mean my friend, who despised tuna for about a little over a decade now, actually thought the tuna sandwich was pretty good lol. The sandwich and salad were good, but I was a little disappointed after they told me that they were all out of wheat bread. \n\nConsidering that I live halfway across town, I probably wouldn't travel all the way here to grab a bite of sandwich, but if I were in the neighborhood and wanted to chill with a friend, I would probably consider eating here again.", "author": "Annie T."}

Heck, I still remember when this place was pretty much abandoned for like, three or four years. Now, as part of the new wave of hip, slightly upscale eateries to pop up around Hayes Valley, we have a new neighborhood coffee shop.\n\nI have to admit, I'm big on both sandwiches and coffee, and while I do like the offerings at Mercury, they're actually a bit more expensive than some of the surrounding places offering similar products. Most of their sandwiches are around $8, and although they come with a little side salad they're pretty basic and small. And their coffee starts at $2. Up until we raised our prices at Peet's I always said I never like to pay $2+ for a cup of coffee ... and I still don't, actually. Still, Mercury's sandwiches and coffee ARE pretty good. And they have beer. On tap!\n\nSeeing as it's a hip little neighborhood joint it's always pretty crowded with people plugged in to their MacBooks and whatnot, but when the place is as tiny as Mercury it's sometimes hard to find a seat, so if you want to sit down and enjoy your meal you might be out of luck on a nice day or a weekend. And oh man is it hot in there, too. Whew!\n\nThe staff here are very friendly though, and are genuinely helpful. No complaints here!\n\nStill, with the price and the small space it's not really a place I'd want to hang out at as often. I still like Cafe Trieste down the street better, so I think for now I'll stick to that for my sandwiches, and since I get free coffee from work I can do without expensive espresso drinks.

We usually go out to a caf\u00e9 in the afternoon and dinner in the night. At least one Thursday a month we try to find a new caf\u00e9 to experience.  Last week we tried out Mercury caf\u00e9 for the first time.  We were there for 2-3 hours.  They have a bunch of small tables set up along one wall with access to outlets and all the laptop folk sat along there.   They have free wifi.  We picked a larger solid table near the window. I like that there was room to spread my books and journals out and the table did not rock. We both had tea and fruit turnovers. The tea came in small white diner coffee cups. The kind of cup that says drink this fast and leave. However, the guy at the counter was very friendly and refilled the hot water whenever I wanted. Still, I like to have enough water/tea so that I can maintain my focus on reading or journaling or talking with my bf and not have an empty cup after a few sips. The caf\u00e9 gets noisy easily. The table next to us had 3-4 people talking loudly and they completely filled the small space with their business meeting. Luckily we weren't trying to communicate just then and both turned our ipods on.  The other drawback was that there were small gnats flying about and some other kind of vermin, maybe fleas.  Really a lot of cafes in SF have fleas, but it's a terrible feeling to be out enjoying the caf\u00e9 and have the little devils crawling up and down you.  I should have remembered to put some repellent on my cuffs.  It was an ok caf\u00e9 experience, but not great, and we probably won't cross town again to return. Maybe I should do a summary because my review wandered a bit:\nPros: Well lit, friendly good service, hot water refills, comfortable tables, wifi, electric outlets, good music, tasty pastries.\nCons: small space--gets loud quickly, too small tea cups (tea pots would be best), not a cozy space.", "author": "Herschell L."}

The Mercury Cafe wasn't incredibly easy to find (it's tucked in a corner of the street amongst a lot of traffic and few other noticeable landmarks), but once I found it, I was immensely happy with its service. \n\nThe coffee is strong, but delicious and they offer refills for $1. Since I was basically homeless for those few days, I ended up getting two out of three meals a day at the Mercury Cafe. They have terrific selection of food (including breakfast food!), delicious and health-conscious sandwiches as well as a fabulous variety of drinks.\n\nLuckily, they have free wireless and an abundance of plugs. It never feels to cramped in that cafe, which is probably because the tables are all situated just far enough from each other, so no one ends up feeling like they're working in each other's bubble. The chairs are comfortable, and it never gets too loud. \n\nI've spent entire days working in coffee shops before, but the Mercury Cafe had such a homey environment and friendly staff, that I kept going back every day I was in town.", "author": "Rachel B."}

Attractive space with good natural light, friendly staff and consistently delicious food.  Nick pays exquisite attention to detail with his baking and coffee.  The scones are the best I've had in San Francisco.  Raisin walnut are the mainstay with other flavors such as organic strawberry and rhubarb, apple oatmeal, and orange with dark chocolate making seasonal appearances.  And the apple (and other fruit) pies really are that good.  Very large organic, free trade coffee selections and high end espresso equipment make for consistently good drinks.  Lunch options include a very good tuna salad sandwich, and various interesting turkey sandwiches among others.  While others are complaining about the twenty-something hipsters on their iPads, I'm 40 years old and have never once brought a laptop here and always feel welcome and comfortable... and regularly see plenty of folks older than myself as well as a few families with little ones.
