While there are a variety of a la carte options I noticed that had a choose two combo for 22 bucks so I decided to go with that option because while I was sort of feeling for a hot dish I also felt like some sashimi as well so this combo was right up my alley.\n\nI ended up going with the chicken katsu and sashimi (chef's choice) as well as a side order of salmon skin roll and a warm sake to start.  The combo also included a miso soup and small salad which is pretty standard with places serving bento boxes or some sort of set.  The sashimi came after both starters but the rest of the plates quickly came right after.  The chef's choice included 3 pieces of red tuna as well as 2 pieces of mackerel resting on shredded radish.  As for the katsu it was served with a side of rice and the salmon skin rolls are what I was expecting which was nice crunchy salmon skin in a nice, tight roll.\n\nFor a late dinner, I thought this was a good choice since I had a bit of variety with both hot, cold and a roll on the side and it was served up both quickly and the service was great.", "author": "Lambert P."}

The best thing about it probably is its size so you don't have to wait long for a table. \n\nI was quickly seated at the bar and then no one came to me until the sushi chef asked a waitress to help me.\n\nI ordered the 12 piece sashimi dinner which came with soup and salad. \n\nThe soup and salad came up first. The miso soup was so thing, it really was disappointing. There is a place in Sacramento called Hana Tsubaki that makes real miso. The salad was good with fresh and crisp vegetables. \n\nThe sashimi came next. I didn't like the cadence of the order. While I was eating the soup, and hadn't yet touched the salad, the sushi chef said \"Here you go sir,\" and handed me my dish.

Maru Sushi also has a really wide price range, from about $5 for an inexpensive roll, going all the way up to $15 for some really good size ones.\n\nFor lunch, we ordered the Ume Shiso sushi (pickled plum) and Popeye sushi (sweet potato tempura with spinach and peanut sauce), along with a 3 piece combo plate with chicken teriyaki and ton katsu. \n\nOur food came out within a reasonable time. I was impressed with the size of the Popeye sushi, which made it well worth the cost (as it was on the higher end of the price range). My partner's combo plate had an impressive amount of food, so between the two of us, we wound up with more than enough to sate both of us. \n\nOverall the food was pretty decent, but I'd say the two sushi rolls I ordered were quite impressive. I was not disappointed at all in the flavours and taste, even though I was initially leery about the makeup of the Popeye roll. I was really glad I ordered it and barely added soy sauce or ginger while eating every piece. \n\nI look forward to trying several of the other vegetarian rolls they have available!", "author": "Cassandra J."}

The gyoza which was kind of greasy/ soggy rather than crispy. I was so excited for nigiri and rolls and this was the part which was kind of a bummer. They gave me sushi when I specifically asked for nigiri. The fish was just slightly warmer than it should be, a health hazard. The salmon and tuna portions however were descent sizes. I also got the red devil, which for $15 I thought would be much better. The tuna was a shredded thing, why would you not just do pieces of fish? And had off textures in the roll.\n\nOnce we got our food we did not see our server again, had to get up and ask someone for our bill.\n\nWhen we got back to the hotel my friend got sick.

Honestly, most of what we ordered was just fine, but one roll, the Volcano roll (salmon), was very obviously spoiled. My bf and I each ate one piece of the roll at the same time and almost lost our lunches right there at the table. We immediately alerted our waitress who called the owner over. The owner said that it is not possible for her food to taste bad and basically told us both we were lying to save money. We told her that our bill is around $100 so why would we make this whole production to save $10?? After arguing back and forth, which was embarassing because at this point the entire restaurant was staring at us, she finally said that she'd give us 50% off that one roll.\nI am usually extremely polite and non-confrontational, so we just paid and left to end this embarassing ordeal. I immediately reported them to the health department and am waiting for their analysis. (They take 7-21 days for a complaint like this so it will be a while.) I just really hope neither of us get sick.", "author": "Michelle W."}

A great portion for the price and the rice was superb. The vegetables and meat tasted fresh and was very flavorful. \n\nDuring the course of the meal a few others entered the restaurant, and the hostess directed some to seat themselves and assisted others.

It's a reliable fairly cheap lunch in Union Square. Nothing amazing but certainly good enough. This time, I ventured from the Bento and ordered the curry donburi. It's vegetarian, and when it arrived I found that it was potatoes, carrots, and a few peas in curry sauce over rice. Unfortunately with the first bite it was obvious that the potatoes were overcooked, and possibly not very fresh in the first place. I mean, how do you mess up potatoes in curry sauce? It just wasn't good. It didn't taste fresh, and the fact that it was only the potatoes and carrots and a few peas meant that I couldn't ignore that the potatoes weren't good. \n\nWhen I put it aside, the hostess asked if everything was okay, and I told her that I didn't care for it, and then it didn't taste very fresh. She responded by saying \"oh no it's very fresh we made it last night!\" Somehow hearing that your food was made the day before it does not inspire confidence in its freshness. Do they sometimes serve curry that's even older than one day? I again said \"it's not good.\" She responded by saying \"oh no it's very good.\" And walked away. \n\nThe other waitress noticed that I wasn't getting , and asked if it was okay,  so I explained. And again she just sort of said oh and walked away. There was no offer to replace it, or to remove it from our bill. So, I wound up paying for it and ate half of my friends Bento. It was clear that I was going to have to make a scene to get it taken off the bill, and I just didn't feel like it. And that was that. I won't go back.", "author": "Jamey M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-13", "description": "The whole time I was eating I was debating whether to give Maru 3 stars or 4. Although Yelp doesn't allow it, 3.75 seemed the appropriate rating, and I laughed when I logged on later and saw other Yelpers said that as well. Then, when I got the check, I made my final decision (see below).\n\nFirst the good: service was fast and friendly. The sushi cuts were fresh and tasty, although definitely not the best I've ever had. There were some cuts clearly showing their age in the case. The cuisine is inventive, as the 49er roll I had came with a razor-thin lemon wrapper. It was indeed tasty if a *bit* sour. I ended up removing the lemon on 2-3 cuts, but overall I applause Maru's zeal in using peel. The building itself is one of the most traditional restaurants I've been too. Took me back to numerous Tokyo trips. If you similarly have pangs for long past trips to the land of the rising sun, the ambiance alone makes it worth a single stop. \n\nThe not as good: the price. My roll was $13.50 which although not setting records for sushi was clearly on the higher side considering what you can get for the same money at other local fish slice-and-dicers. The price ended up helping me decide on a clear 3-stars. I tarried over the food though before this. As noted, it was \"good\" but definitely not great. Beyond the fish as mentioned above, the edemame was clearly microwaved. The seaweed salad was tasty but not winning any Michelin stars. \n\nOverall, if I was close to Union Square and wanted to bring a date here without walking far, I'd come here for the ambiance and expectations she wouldn't turn up her nose at the food. But if I wanted to impress a date, or enjoy a higher caliber cut myself...or save money...I'd go elsewhere.", "author": "Christopher M."}

I visited in the early afternoon for lunch and ordered two fresh oysters and the nigiri combination plate.  The total bill including tax and tip was just under $30.\n\nI'll get to the food in a moment, but the first good thing was that the men's bathroom looked and smelled clean, and it was adequately supplied with hand soap and paper towels for washing any public transportation remnants off my hands before enjoying my meal.  I appreciate restaurants that take care to make sure the bathroom isn't gross.\n\nThe service today was very good.  The waitresses were friendly and attentive and I didn't have to wait at all before they gave me a menu and asked me what I wanted to drink (water and green tea).  Slight disappointment at the temperature of the tea.  I would have preferred it to be a bit more hot than it was, but it wasn't a big enough deal for me to ask them to heat it up.\n\nI chose to sit at a table at the front so I could look out the window and watch the cable cars full of tourists going up and down the slope that is Powell Street between Bush and Sutter.  The weather was good today and they all seemed to be having fun.\n\nOK, as to the food, it was clearly very fresh and it was delicious.\n\nThe oysters were served with a tasty mignonette which nicely complemented their flavor without overpowering that fresh taste of ocean that I love so much.  I should have gone with the half dozen instead of getting just two.  Next time I will.  My server didn't say, but to me it looked they were kumamoto oysters, and they set me back $4.95 which seemed a reasonable price.\n\nThe nigiri combination, $17.95 for 8 pieces, was nicely prepared and everything on the plate looked, smelled, and tasted very fresh and delicious.  When I requested no tuna (I really don't care for it), the sushi chef substituted with a second salmon nigiri and the salmon was outstanding.  Everything from the shrimp to the yellowtail was excellent, but hands down the salmon was my favorite thing on the plate.  It felt like it was melting in my mouth.  The sushi rice had very good texture and was nicely seasoned, and the fish-to-rice ratio was the way I like it: big fish, little rice and not the other way around.", "author": "Claus C."}

That needs some clarification. I may have moved but I'm still a Giants fan and a Niners fan. \n\nBack to sushi. Doing the airbnb thing near Union Square, I set out to find a nearby sushi place. The usual suspects were all jammed up so I wandered around not so aimlessly until I stumbled upon Maru Sushi.\n\nAt first I was a bit hesitant as the place was fairly empty. Hunger trumped (I'm not sure if any word with t-r-u-m-p in it should be allowed) hesitancy so I took a seat at the sushi bar. I was greeted warmly and enthusiastically by the sushi chefs, both of whom looked like they've been doing sushi for many years (years trump - there it is again, that word! - youth). \n\nFeeling frisky for fish, I ordered a Kirin and small bottle of unfiltered sake and asked the sushi chefs if they would think of me as both sushiphile and sushinewbie. The trick question didn't confuse these Senmon-ka. Immediately, they motioned the waitress to take away my menu. Then they went to work creating an amazing array of nigiri, sashimi and rolls. The only thing I asked was that they don't slip me any squid (I harpooned a squid once in the Andaman Sea and I can still see its ink enveloping me).\n\nEverything was fresh, nicely and respectfully presented. \n\nSo here's the thing - try Maru Sushi, you won't be disappointed, even if the hipsters are somewhere else.

To do this, I ordered the 49ner and the Dragon.\n\n49ner: Being a Vikings fan, I despise the 49ners and I really didn't like this roll too much either.  I believe the roll consisted of crab with topped salmon with lemon.

I've walked by the restaurant tons of times, but never ventured in due to its proximity to Union Square. The restaurant was super quiet we walked in, which was a little awkward. Our server was quick to get us seated and take our order - even before we had opened the menu. We ordered edamame and miso soup to start, and started gabbing away. The server came by three or four times afterward to take our order, which I thought was a bit pushy. The miso soup was tasty and salty (I normally add a dash of soy sauce for added flavor, but it wasn't necessary this time). The edamame was fine, nothing special. We also ordered the 49er roll, crazy roll, and spicy tuna roll. The crazy roll was by far my favorite - it was packed with a random assortment of fish. The other two rolls were also good, although a tad pricer than I expected. The server was good about refilling our water glasses, although slow with processing the check. All in all, a good sushi spot, but would not be my go-to. The vibe/ambiance could be spruced up, and the rolls a little less expensive.", "author": "Regina L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-03-02", "description": "If there was an option to select zero stars instead of just one I would. This was the WORST sushi experience I have ever encountered. \n\nI absolutely dread writing horrible reviews because it is a waste of time and energy but I wish someone did earlier to save me from such a horrible experience.\n\nBACK STORY: The initial visit was on 2/28/16 around 2pm with a party of 5 including myself. We were all tourist in SF on a quick trip to union square. We also all happen to be craving sushi because we are all frequent eating and sushi lovers. Found this spot randomly walking around and thought it was fate. The restaurant had two other customers but was pretty much empty (SUPER SLOW). Thought that was a sign of bad service but Yelp gave it 4 stars so we just decided to go with it.\n\nTHE STORY IF YOU CARE: Upon our arrival, viewing the menu wasn't very clear. Tons of options but little did we know it would be so strict with pretty much basic sushi if you wanted a \"deal\" otherwise you're better off just ordering the expensive rolls for a better taste. Right off the bat our server/waitress was extremely rude and brief. I asked her if we could split checks within our party so we can order accordingly just to make it easier for her. She yelled at me and told me we would do it at the end. She had ZERO patience to explain the menu when asked questions and rushed us to order. Her assumptions caused confusion and chaos as well as ordering the completely wrong thing I asked for. Thinking that I ordered the deluxe meal (10 pieces of Nigiri and a roll that I thought was your choice) she was extremely rude when the sides were given and ordered my party not to give me the miso soup since all of their orders included the following. She was extremely rude about it. I continued to keep my patience and politeness. We waited an hour and a half for our food in a empty restaurant and over the course of time asked her several other times for water because she kept forgetting and we were dying of thirst. Around the third hour everyone received their food except me with only receiving one roll.m and waiting for the nigiri. Once we realized, we acknowledged her that I had wanted the deluxe special. Clearly we misinterpreted the order on both ends but if she explained the menu better and wasn't in such a hurry the mistake would've been prevented. That is completely her job to help the customer. She quickly left the table to tell the chef about the order with once again not caring to understand what we exactly asked for. As soon as I could get her attention again I asked her how long would it take and she rudely interrupted me and was so quick to answer my question and (AGAIN not listening to me) gave me the wrong reply. She then lied and said the chef made it already. I no longer was hungry but didn't want make a scene or ruin the time I had with my party. At this point I just wanted to leave and ask for the check. Lastly, she confused our checks (that I tried to prevent) charged me for the deluxe meal and two extra rolls. I pretty much paid $83 including my partner's meal and a picture of beer. The outcome was for a half empty stomach and bad attitude. I would've never paid that price but then I remember that she was an older lady probably working for her family and I didn't want to take it out on them.\n\nOVERALL: Customer service is extremely important and can make or break a business. I just hope no one has to go through this situation and this saves them the time and trouble. The worst part was the service was so terrible the sushi may have been good but the entire experience left a disgusting taste in my mouth. I will never visit this place again even if I was starving.", "author": "Alani E."}

They also ended up having to give half of my boyfriend's meal to go because they didn't realize they messed up the order. We didn't think to ask if it was coming because the timing was so off.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the udon noodle was great. However, the sushi left a lot to be desired and was poorly constructed.", "author": "Matthew O."}

One menu said lunch combo for two items was 10.95 then she gave me a new menu saying it was now 11.95. I ordered my food and waited much longer than the 10 minutes I was told it would be. I asked for no salad and instead for extra rice as well. When she came out with my food she handed me the hot plastic container without a bag. I asked her for a bag and, with an attitude, the worker said she forgot to charge me for one as if that meant I wasn't allowed to pay for one after the fact. When I got to my office to eat the food, my sushi (California roll) was drenched in teriyaki sauce from the chicken. I wouldn't have cared for a simple mishap but as I got further into my meal they kept occurring. The salad I asked to be withheld seemed to have been put into the container on accident and then not thoroughly removed. The rice was placed on a few bits of salad and drenched in dressing. This is not to mention the sushi wasabi that was placed within the rice compartment (for the chicken) of the container. The chicken itself was tough and hard to swallow and the California roll was tasteless aside from teriyaki sauce they managed to get all over it. Do not eat here. My pet peeve is restaurants that try to play their customers especially though dishonest pricing. Definitely not worth it.", "author": "Sabrina A."}

Restaurant is full of patrons, so this looks promising.  Wife started with uni and tobiko nigiri sushi.  She said the uni and tobiko were both fresh, and the rice to uni/tobiko ratio were adequate.  We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen, and found it to be meh...One reason was the noodles were really over cooked and mushy.  The broth had flavor, but was lacking something...not sure what it was, but it just lacked that umami thing.  Additionally, they had an overcooked boiled egg sitting in the broth which could have influenced the slight sulfer flavor in the broth.  Along with the tonkotsu I had an order of deep fried oysters.  Nothing special. Wish they hit it with some salt after it came out of the fryer.  Was cooked OK, served with a lemon wedge and katsu sauce.  I then noticed they had specials of monk fish liver and kampachi nigiri.  Both sushi were excellent, and again had decent product to rice ratios.

This evening sushi was one of my choices and being near Union Square I decided to finally visit it.\n\nFirst it was a good sign that more than half the tables were occupied.  I chose to sit at a table over sitting at the sushi bar.  I went for the regular sashimi combo, which is 12 pieces which this evening consisted 3 each tuna, albacore, salmon, and white tuna.  I was disappointed yellowtail was not included.  Otherwise the fish tasted good and fresh.\n\nI may try some of the other Japanese restaurants nearby, in particular on Bush Street nearby, next time I want to check out a Japanese restaurant in this area.", "author": "H K."}

I usually went for lunch on weekends, as the prices for the same amount of food are a lot cheaper at lunchtime.\n\nHowever, after the way I was treated there last night, I will NEVER eat at Maru Sushi again.\n\nI was having a late dinner with my boyfriend.  We ordered salad, tempura, vegetarian rolls of various sorts, and miso soup.  The miso soup was cold - not just tepid, but cold.  But the real problem was the sake.  We ordered a bottle of hot sake to split.  When I was almost finished with my second glass, I noticed a small insect in the glass.\n\nI understand that restaurants, just like homes, sometimes get insects.  This is the second time I have eaten there and gotten an insect in my sake.  I have to wonder where they keep the sake jugs and glasses - I'm sure the health department would be just as interested.\n\nThe first time this happened, our meal was free and we received a personal apology.  I believe it was still the Tempura House then.\n\nI could not believe this had happened a second time.  I immediately brought it to the server's attention and asked for our food to go.  She did not offer to replace it, or to remove it or credit our bill.  She simply took the glass away and proceeded to spend 5 minutes busing tables, and ignored our request for food to go.\n\nI am not quick to anger, particularly given that this is one of my most visited and convenient places.  I brought the fact that our requests were being ignored to the sushi chef's attention.  The server was still busing tables and would not make eye contact with me.\n\nThere were by that time no other customers in the restaurant.  They made no offer to credit or even provide us with the bill.  They did not apologize or try to fix the situation in any manner. \n\nIt is my opinion that a sushi restaurant that cannot keep bugs out of the sake jars probably has more problems than just that.  I didn't see what their inspection rating was because the certificate was not visible.  Although I will not be returning there, this is serious enough that I believe the health department should be notified.  This is a busy restaurant that is usually packed with both tourists and locals.  \n\nI have to wonder how many others got a side of insect with their sake.  It felt to me like lightning striking twice.  I am a believer in second and even third chances, but this is inexcusable.\n\nDear Maru Sushi: you have lost a good customer.  Even though your food is overpriced and your service completely lackluster, I always tipped at least 15% and I enjoyed the majority of my experiences with you.  I feel both personally slighted at the way I was treated upon the second bug incident and disappointed that any business would treat a customer as discourteously as you treated me.\n\nDear Yelpers: If you'd like overpriced average sushi prepared in what I strongly suspect is an unclean kitchen with insect infestation, this is your place.  I am now taking applications for a new sushi restaurant in the lower Nob Hill area, so message me if you know of a good one where I won't find a bug in my sake.", "author": "Jillian W."}

I didn't finish it, maybe because of the sumo-sized chicken, or maybe I was just saving room for the Fried Tempura Ice Cream. Who doesn't love fried goodness? I've never seen a dessert item like this on a menu before, but since I'm a little ignorant to Japanese cuisine I don't know if this is traditional or a novelty. They had some interesting flavors like red bean, green tea and mango. I decided to keep it safe and went with the mango. It was really good. Again, the portions are out of control.

I tend to order the bento boxes or some sort of terriyaki meat dish. So for me the food was pretty good. The service however was poor and will unfortunately keep me from returning. On a positive note, they take American Express. Which is good since they wouldn't have gotten paid any other way today.", "author": "Heather L."}

Sure there are \"nicer\" places for sushi in the city but when you want a nice quiet evening and you live downtown there are not a lot of choices that aren't crawling with tourists.  Consistanly good/fresh sushi, decent service, big comfy chairs and clean bathrooms. Pretty much covers all the bases for me.", "author": "Mother L."}

First, the food is ok, but the staff needs training.  Why are the three staff members talking in a corner and not serving the customer; get one of those call buttons on each table so we do not need to get up and find help.   When a customer asks for a dish or plate say \"yes madam\" or \"yes sir\" but not \"you do not need a plate\".  And why does it take three staff members 5 minutes to calculate the bill.  Sorry, but the three persons and the light bulb theory does not work in the restaurant business.  So, please have your staff go to Math.com for a quick review on addition and percentage.", "author": "jon f."}

That would have earned them a 2 or 2.5-star rating.  But then the bill came: $27 for 1 order of toro sashimi???  Are you serious???  It was on their specials board, with no price listed.  The sushi chef just said \"Didn't you know?\"  No, I didn't know - how was I supposed to know when you didn't say anything when I placed my order and there's no price on the board?  He said \"Have you had toro before?\"  Yes, but not here, and I sure as #@!! didn't pay $27 for it.  Well, it was already eaten, and we were late for the theatre so we paid, but we won't be back, that's for sure.", "author": "J T."}

We decided to try Maru sushi in San Fran.  We parked across the street in the garage and came in for dinner.  We were seated and the waitress made us wait for a really long time before we could place our orders.  The food arrived with the sushi first and then the pot stickers came later.  I was not very happy with the service.  The waitress seemed irritated when my friend asked for the sushi to be prepared without avocado.  Granted, its an interesting request but  simple request.  She kept trying to offer suggestions but they were not the same kind of sushi and were more expensive so it didnt make much sense.  She eventually just put the order in without the avocado but it just seemed to be and odd situation.  There were not many people in the restuarant but she never came back for refills.  The food was ok but nowhere near the best sushi I have had in the city.  I would say that if you were in the area and looking for sushi, you could find better options.", "author": "Adam B."}

This place was the next closest Japanese place and they had a lunch special, with 2 items for $8.50 and 3 for $10.50. There was one lady working as the greeter and waitress so it took a while to get our order though she was nice. Our \"Romeo and Juliet\" came and it tasted fine, but nothing spectacular. My friend and I both got the bento boxes and it came out like 20 minutes later but hers came first and then mine. Then there was a problem: mine wasn't mine. Apparently the lady gave me some guy's order and he got mine. I called her over after like 5minutes because she was in the kitchen and told her and she quickly switched it over. It bugged me because I waited for a while so if I was a bitch I could have easily picked at the food but I didn't. The guy just got it so I assumed he didn't touch it yet either. The food was alright but my beef Yakinkunu dish was really rubbery or hard to chew, but the sashimi wasn't bad though  The lady was nice, but she gave us our bill twice when the bill was already on the table. It wasn't busy but her mind seemed pre-occupied. I might visit this place later on if I am craving for cheap Japanese food during lunch but otherwise I might go to some other places.", "author": "Annie T."}

The service here is from the cutsey-off handed school: reaching across you, argung, hurrying you, sloppy and distracted. We ate here once a year or so ago then returned last night to exactly the same service with different waitresses as though they had been \"trained\" that way. The food is good, a bit above most Japanese restaurants for what they do. And, if you're 19 you may not even mind the vague, high school approach. If you're a little older it will be better to control the service the moment you walk in. Not worth it for the meal and, as far as an experience, there is none. There was an outrageously drunk and load woman at the bar and the fact that they nothing to try and control her is an indication of the level of service at this place. Walk past.", "author": "TW M."}

So the fiance and I are trying to hit up all these neighborhood joints before we move out of the neighborhood. I wish we wouldn't have wasted one of our meals on this place and just stuck with a pizza from uncle vito's instead. First of all, it was Friday night around 9. The place was pretty much dead. They sat us by the door and left it open the whole time. Yes, it was fairly warm night for the city - but still, 9pm in SF, it was coldie by the door! Close it already, it's not really summer time yet. Then I went to the rest room to wash my hands before dinner - NO SOAP!? What? How can a restaurant have no soap in the bathroom, ever, isn't there laws or something about having to wash your hands, and allow your customers to wash their hands. So, stuck to the hand sanitizer int eh purse, but still was annoyed. Then the waitress was so shy we could barely make out the words she was trying to say to us. We asked about a specific roll another table had ordered, she told us it was some expensive roll of the specials, it looked awesome so we ordred it. What we got was a totally different roll than the table we'd tried to copy. The sushi was only ok, but the service and atmosphere was lame lame lame. Will never go back and this place will definitely help me not miss the neighborhood anymore once we move.", "author": "Audrey V."}
