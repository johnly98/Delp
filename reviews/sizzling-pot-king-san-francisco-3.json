Overall the dish was okay, I've had better elsewhere, but it wasn't terrible either. The flavoring was a little bit boring, despite the spiciness of the whole dish, there wasn't much going on besides spicy, sweet and salty.\n\nYou are able to add a variety of other toppings, the noodles and fish/crab balls being good choices to balance everything else in the pot.\n\nWe also ended up ordering a side of noodles (which were pretty much boiled noodles and a soy-like topping), but there weren't too bad. We got a pitcher of the plum juice, but that mostly tasted like a sweet sugary drink. Good for relieving spicy food, but not that great tasting on its own.", "author": "Tyler T."}

Also go the dry pot with beef and cuddlefish (hot and spicy + extra spicy). Got rice cakes in both and vermicelli.\n\nOne thing to note, when you come here, it just feels like a rundown place. It's not a date spot for sure, but I didn't care.\n\nIf you like spicy but don't want to be like dripping sweat, probably don't get the extra spicy. As you keep eating it, the heat stacks on. I enjoyed both pots and it was nice having a really spicy one, and then a \"cooldown\" one.\n\nI wouldn't get cuddlefish again and probably not the lamb. The lamb was actually just chopped up lamb pieces and not slices. I was thinking like hotpot lamb slices, but that was not the case. The duck was actually really good. Thought it had good flavor and still was nice and tender. The beef was standard, I'd opt to go for other less \"safe\" options like tendon or intestine.\n\nThe bowl itself doesn't come with toooo many ingredients so be sure to add on more things. Some kind of noodle is a requirement IMO, we added vermicelli and we all loved that addition (really soaks up the sauce, similar to the potato). \n\nAnd this place is pretty cheap too.

A huge vat of cooked-to-order spicy food, with a burner placed underneath so the oily sauce bubbles while you eat.  Perfect for sharing, though gorging by yourself is definitely a possibility too.  Lunchtime seems a lot less crowded than dinnertime.\n\nSpicy & Hot Beef Short Rib w/ Instant Noodle (Very Spicy option): I ordered the spiciest option and was not disappointed.  Reminds me of the spicier dishes at some really good Sichuan restaurants in Chinatown.  Except something magical happens with the bubbling/sizzling; the liquid vaporizes a little so you might be inhaling spices if you don't wait for your food to cool down.  This could be good or bad, depending on how much you like aromatic spices.  Of the default veggies, I really liked the fried potato chunks.  They did an awesome job of absorbing the chili oil.  The celery created a cooling contrast to the spicy sauce.  The sprouts and cauliflower were boring though.  I added some instant noodles for my carbs (instead of paying extra for a side of rice) and that was a delicious choice.  Loved how the chili oil really clung to each noodle.  Only downside was that the noodles were placed on the bottom and some were scorched then stuck to the pot partway through the meal.  I had mixed feelings about the beef short ribs.  They were delicious, but super awkward to eat.  It's look like someone took a Korean short rib and cut each rib into like 6 pieces, sure to cut through every big bone piece to make smaller bone pieces.

I am surprised, however, at its unlikely replacement, a bustling Chinese dry pot restaurant that acknowledges the huge Asian youth populace living in the immediate area. I didn't see the regular Orpheum theater-going crowd or the wandering tourist traffic I usually see around the 'hood. It was packed with gaggles of giggling Asian girls in the booths and tables of bickering Asian couples, so I fit in just fine albeit longer in the tooth than everybody else.\n\nPots were indeed sizzling at most of the tables. I was seated in the middle of all the activity and tried to figure out what I could order on my own. In the evening, the only sizes they offer are the $22.99 Medium and the $32.99 Large Combo. The $11.99 Small is apparently offered just at lunch from Monday through Thursday.  Oh I see. When I asked the server if they had a vegetarian selection, she shook her head and told me to get the chicken. All by myself. (Don't wanna be) All by myself. So I ordered a Medium Grilled Cooked Snails in Garlic, medium spicy - that's the second hottest level on their heat meter (photo: http://bit.ly/2FY29af) and hoped for the best. It arrived post haste, and my goodness, it was a mass of sizzling food in a hot pot.\n\nThe snails were cooked tender and mixed with broccoli, bean sprouts, peppers, mushrooms, cauliflower, and cilantro in a heavy garlic sauce, and frankly the spice was not nearly as amped up as I was expecting. Even with all that food in front of my face, I needed some kind of side dish and went for the $1.99 Black Fungus, which presumptively came stir-fried in the hot pot itself and not as a separate item (photo: http://bit.ly/2FsEPna). The result was that the fungus was not providing the taste of freshness I was looking for to contrast the hot pot ingredients. Meanwhile, the gas-fueled flickering flame was starting to make me nervous. Lesson learned: Next time I'll bring my posse with me, but first, I have to hire a posse. Now where can I rent one?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...bring an appetite, bring several appetites, and oh yes, be Asian\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...still has the all-white finishes from the Thought Style days but it felt as busy as any Chinatown eatery\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...not that helpful\nTOTAL - 3 stars...it sizzles, it's hot, and there's enough for an army", "author": "Ed U."}

Not that kind of \"facial\", you pervs! \n\nThere's not really a shortage of shabu and hot pot places in SF but dry hot pot places? Since Celestial Flame closed, I don't know any restaurant in SF that solely serves this fiery Sichuan specialty. \n\nSo, say hello to Sizzling Pot King that took over the short-loved Thai fusion restaurant: Thoughts Style Cuisine) (https://www.yelp.com/biz/thoughts-style-cuisine-showroom-san-francisco!\n\nSizzling Pot King is a small chain (Sunnyvale, San Diego, Seattle) that serves dry hot pot consisting of meat and veggies with a myriad of chilies and spices that will light your toilet paper on fiyah! Don't worry, there's a non-spicy option. The good thing about dry hot pot is there's no steam so if you have cake face like me, you'll leave with your eyebrows intact and not melted off! \n\nMy coworker and I thought we were beating the lunch rush by arriving at Sizzling King Pot before 11:30 am but we didn't - it was popping! It was packed with Mandarin speaking customers which was a great sign. \n\nSince Sizzling Pot King is in soft opening mode, there's a limited menu. The only apps available are potstickers and mantou (steamed buns).\n\nFor Dry Hot Pot:\n*Choose your proteins (tons of choices): Lamb, pork, beef, rabbit, snails, frog, intestines, tripe, gizzards, tongue, or seafood (lobster, crab, crawfish) are just to name a few.\n\n*Choose your 3 size: Small ($11.99), Medium ($22.99), or Large ($32.99). The small is only available Monday - Thursday. For the large, you can choose two meats. \n\n*Choose your flavor: Hot & Sour, Garlic, Sweet & Sour, or Seafood. \n\n*Choose your spice level: Non-spicy, mild-spicy, medium-spicy, or very-spicy.\n\nAll dry hot pots come with fried potato, cauliflower, celery, and bean sprouts.\n\nYou can customize your dry hot pot with extra veggies, carbs (noodles)and other proteins like spam, sausages, and pig's blood for an extra $.99 to $3.99. \n\nI highly recommend ordering rice ($1.50/bowl) to help balance all the spicy goodness. \n\nNO MSG is used. \n\nMy coworker and I ordered the Large Dry Hot Pot w/ half beef tongue and half beef short ribs ($32.99):  http://bit.ly/2onZ0Ie. Flavor: garlic. Spice: medium-spicy. We added silk noodles ($1.99) which is yam noodles like Korean japchae.\n\nThe meat, noodle, and veggie medley was so good! The beef tongue was sliced thin and tender with a nice bite. Luckily, there was a good amount of beef tongue because the short ribs were all bones (boo!). The noodles and veggies were all cooked well with the proper texture. I loved the fried potatoes for a crunchy texture element. \n\nThe medium-spicy garlic flavor was on-point, aromatic with a good mala numbing spice. The large pot can feed 3-4 people but we couldn't stop digging in for more because of that addictive spice.\n\nFood service took a long time because a group of 20 rolled in before us which delayed the kitchen by 45 minutes. The staff was super apologetic and gave us several updates on when our order was coming. \n\nThey do have a note outside to let customers know orders may take longer than expected because they're in soft opening mode. Not going to dock them for service since they're managing customer expectations which I appreciate. \n\nIt's a small space so it's best for groups of 2-4 people.\n\nParking, well it's SF but it's not as tough in this area since there's not that many commercial businesses on the block. \n\nThere's nothing like Sizzling Pot King in the area so I think they're going to do really well in the hood.

As far as the decor is minimal, white washed walls and basic table and chairs. The menu is colorful and the prices are very reasonable. The one thing about Gan Guo's is that no matter how many items you add to the pot towards everything is stir fried in one sauce and one pot. Therefore we tried to order some side dishes to change up the flavors. Out of the 7 side dishes we wanted they only had one, the gizzards which was awful. We had leftover gizzards and we did not want to take it home. The pot itself was pretty good. The main items we chose were the baby cuttlefish, tripe, lobster balls and the beef tongue. The beef tongue was especially good, well cooked and tender. We were the second to last customers for lunch that day and the staff wanted everyone to finish up and get out even though they were polite about it. The Sizzling Gan Guo's is ok once a year for me.

I added a lot of add-ons like fish/shrimp/lobster ball, pig blood, enoki mushroom, vermicelli, tofu, etc.\n\nThe spicy pot is served over a live fire so the food is consistently kept hot. Each pot comes with a 'vegetable base' like bean sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, potato, and celery.\n\nI think overall the flavor is pretty singular.

As the only dry pot restaurant I've ever found in the US, it definitely satisfied my craving! \n\nYou start with a protein base that also includes a few vegetables already (potatoes, bean sprouts, cauliflower). You can pick the flavor, level of spiciness, and size. For dinner there are only two sizes, medium and large. We tried both, and realized that the large doesn't have that much more food, so instead of getting a large combo, we thought it was a better deal to pay $10 more and get two medium pots instead.\n\nNext you can do some add ons, which includes a pretty wide selection of protein, vegetables, and noodles. We added a couple of veggies to every pot and everyone loved the extra flavor. It didn't take too long for the food to come out. Since we had a big group, we got to try a few different things. The beef was a little dry, but generally all the other meats were good. \n\nAll together we tried 4 pots and the fish for 4 people. The fish was so so, definitely not the giant portion you get in China and less flavorful, but we liked all the pots. Total came out to ~$25 per person and we were absolutely stuffed. I think between 2 people one medium pot with lots of add ones would be perfect.", "author": "Julie Z."}

Usually the door is usually open and you can see there's a wait inside for dinnertime. Plus all the patrons are Chinese-speaking so it seemed like an authentic spot to me.\n\nIt's sizzling hot pot (but dry, so with a sauce instead of soup broth) so the food comes in a pot with a flame that they light underneath. You pick the meat options and it comes with potato and celery by default as sides; you can also order more sides for small fees. I got the medium size both times and it's enough to feed two with leftovers, or three just fine. At around $20, that's a pretty good deal in SF! The food is pretty tasty.\n\nI like spicy food and tried the spiciest level the first time, and it was a little bit painful, so opted for medium spicy the next time. There's the fancy options here like beef tongue, snails, pig intestine, etc. which is up my alley. Came here with a non-adventurous person the first time so had to get regular beef. The second time I got snail, which felt a little underwhelming since they're little pieces and lacked much flavor. But you never know until you try...\n\nI want to come back and try the different meat options! Next time I'd probably try the beef tongue and squid or cuttlefish. If you come right at 5 or 6 on a weekday there shouldn't be much of a wait. I went back on a holiday (July 4th) around 7pm and we had to wait about half an hour. Also, you supposedly get 10% off if you pay all in cash.\n\nIt's crowded, probably not the best service and not the classiest ambience, but the food is what I'm about and Sizzling Pot King gets a good rating in my book.", "author": "Electra C."}

We always get the garlic sauce, which is delicious. \n\nAfter you choose a base (we like chicken), you can add as many toppings as your want. We always select fried tofu and instant noodles, which really soak up the sauce. I might even get double orders of the fried tofu next time, because it is so tasty!\n\nNOTE that the size of the pot only affects how much of the base you get. The amount of topping appears to be to same. So if you get a lot of toppings like we usually do, you will not see a noticeable difference between the medium and large sizes. \n\nOther dishes there that we love: fried potstickers, pumpkin cake, and the steamed and fried chinese bread with condensed milk. \n\nExpect a wait on Friday and Saturday nights, unless you get there at opening or after the first round of diners leave around 8-8:30. The restaurant seems to be packed with customers from mainland China, which is a testament to the quality of the food.  \n\nNo complaints about the service.
