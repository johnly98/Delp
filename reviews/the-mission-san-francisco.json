The Mission District used to be the happening place in San Fran but as of late has become a bit sketchy. I won't lie this is the most homeless populated area I've seen in the city so far. But I will say there are also hipsters so I guess the thing to know I'd enter at your own risk?? On a real note, I felt safe the whole time it's just not as clean as other areas. \n\nA couple neat thrift shops and great restaurants I will say. If you're a fan of Mexican food, you have to go to La Taqueria, best burrito I've ever had! A cool area but if you're wanting to spend the better part of the day in the area, go to mission for lunch and then go through the mural alley to Valencia st. Mural Alley isn't the actual name I don't think but you get the idea, a whole alley with murals on both sides by local artists. Super interesting to look at and there's tons of people also there looking and taking photos. So take this alley over to Valencia and find more caf\u00e9s and vintage shops. Same area but I would say Valencia is nicer and more hip. More people too but worth it to go down both streets.", "author": "Cara H."}

You'd think the architecture would clash but somehow one complements the other. \n\nOften gritty but paradoxically now out of reach for anyone but the super affluent (hello Zuck and Liberty er, Facebook Hill), you'll find a schizophrenic district that's seen more change and upheaval than almost any other part of the city except for maybe Dogpatch.\n\nBut, the Mission's population density is what makes the dichotomy so striking: The great push forward of an ever-more-expensive city paired with the heartbreak of artists, families, both recent and established immigrants unable to hang on or just pushed out for the far better-heeled new residents, dollar-eyed developers and city leaders way too comfortably nestled in VCs' pockets. \n\nIt's the Mission that makes me pause and question if it's time for us to go. \n\nI think there's still a place for us.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

All I noticed were the dirt, garbage, filth, crime, junkies, gangs, homelessness and corruption from the union halls.\n\nOh wait, that's City Hall. \n\nBut in seriousness, I did not like coming to The Mission and it was my least favorite neighborhood in San Francisco. I was young, na\u00efve, dumb and stupid. Now, I know better and appreciate it a lot more. \n\nLong before it was called San Francisco, The Mission was populated by the Ohlone and Yelamu Indians. After the Spanish Missionaries colonized this place and named it Yerba Buena, they established Mission San Francisco de Asis. The natives were used as slave labor to build and finish the Mission and their population dwindled to just fewer than 50 in a few short years. \n\nSounds familiar to what's happening now? \n\nWith streets named Valencia, Guerrero, Dolores, De Haro, Bernal, Mariposa, and Noe, these were the original Ranchos (mostly Spanish-Mexican families) that were granted lands devoted to raising cattle and sheep. With the expansion of the Mission after the Gold Rush, it was subdivided into permanent housing for the incoming working-class immigrants like the Germans, Italian and Irish.  \n\nDuring the 40' and 60's, there was a large influx of Mexicans as most of them came to complete the western span of the Bay Bridge. Ever since then, through the 70's, 80's and 90's, most of the immigrants came from Central America, which gave The Mission it's distinct Latin culture that has been prevalent until today. \n\nWell, until the Dot-Com boom, Hipsters and Techies suddenly started moving in initiating gentrification as we know it today, which has created a culture clash for better or worse. But the more things change, the more they stay the same and history appears to repeat itself. \n\nBut what I do love about The Mission is the cornucopia of different cultures that has created a vibrant place, especially when it comes to the food scene. You can just about taste the world in this neighborhood with so many restaurants representing each corner of the world, it seems. \n\nThe Mission is home to the first Philz's, Carnaval, Mission-style Burritos, street food, Michelin-rated restaurants, hole-in-the-wall places, great bars, bakeries, street art, ice cream (Mitchell's, Bi-Rite, Humphry Slocombe), murals, music and so much more.

There are tons of Mexican restaurants that are located throughout the neighborhood, showcasing a localized styling of Mexican food. \nDid you know that San Francisco is the original home of the Mission burrito? There are also tons of great Salvadoran and Nicaraguan restaurants there as well as a large number of street food vendors. \n\n A large number of other restaurants are also popular, including: Mission Chinese Food, Mission Pie, Bar Tartine, La Taqueria, Papalote, and Foreign Cinema on Mission Street, Delfina on 18th, and Luna Park on Valencia\n\nRELIABLE TRANSPORTATION:\nThe neighborhood is served by the BART with stations located on Mission Street at 16th Street and 24th Street.  Muni bus numbers 9, 12, 14, 14L, 22, 27, 33, 48, 49, 67, and  the J Church Muni  line, which runs down Church Street and San Jose Avenue.\n\nWith that said, this is great place to visit in San Francisco and get a different look at the city from a different view!", "author": "Porsche C."}

I think the first time I ever stepped foot into the Mission was after a day spent at Dolores Park eating good old Bi-Rite Ice Cream. It was really at that initial experience that I fell in love with everything about the Mission District.\n\nSpanning several blocks, the Mission District literally houses all the best culture that San Francisco has to offer. If I remember correctly, this area used to be all Hispanic back in the 80s and 90s. Now, there's such a hodgepodge of different groups of people that all come together for one person: to relax and have fun. \n\nJust go out onto the street and it will be difficult and nearly impossible for you not to see something interesting. Whether it be a beautiful mural, the famous women's center on Mission, or even the Truffle Man with his \"special\" chocolate, the Mission has EVERYTHING to love and die for. \n\nA number of famous eateries, dessert places, etc. are all located in the Mission as well. Some personal favorites include Yamo (burmese street style food), Poc-Chuch (el salvadorian food), Tartine bakery (best bakery), and of course Bi-Rite (best ice cream). Honestly, there's the best everything in the mission. Oh yes, don't forget El Farolito - the best quesadilla in the world.\n\nSo overall, the Mission is perfect. I am so jelly of people who live around here. There's so much life around here. I don't care when people say it's dangerous. That's life. Hop on Bart and get off at 16th and Mission. You won't regret.\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

There are some people that look shady that may possibly approach you for money, drugs, alcohol, etc. Then there are those that are the hard working business owners or blue collared workers.  There are also the artists and performers.  And these types appear during the day.  The area can be quite lively at night as well with young professionals looking to drink, have a good time, and relax.\n\nTons to see, do and taste here. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area as well. As businesses keep popping up and doing well here, I think the area will be more expensive like the rest of San Francisco.

This area has everything you could possibly need, and never need all while being in SF. \n\nThe restaurants go from your local organic vegan restaurants to the most romantic Italian cafes, to the best dive peruvian taco spot open till 4:30am. Endless eateries if you are a foodie like me. \n\nBeing in SF is all about walking and you can have an entire weeks worth of dates just walking to and fro different places.\n\nThe bar scene is FUN! Not your typical douchey Marina crowd with 40yo Peter Pans trying to pick up on barely 18s. Everyone is genuinely there for a good time and never a problem since I've been making my rounds.  Just to name a few, Mission Bar, Elixir, Uptown, Double Dutch and Elbo room I have definitely frequented and had a pretty good night. \n\nAll in All, this area is a great time for any age, gender, race.

I remember back in the 80s/90s when this was a dangerous place.  Not so any longer.  I took a walk through in early June 2014 on a nice sunny day (it seems it's always sunny in the Mission).  Sure, there's still some rundown areas but overall the Mission has sooooo changed and improved.  True enough, the newbies have taken over and are driving rents up.  This is called capitalism.  They've got the capital; the poor/poorer don't.  While I don't like the complete gentrification that's happened, that's the new reality.  Deal with it.  Lots of shops, restaurants, and taquerias everywhere.  And wow, so many of the Victorian houses have been lovingly restored.  And murals all over the place.  Sure, some are just graffiti.  Most are pretty quality.  The Mission deserves at least a couple hour walk about.  Divert off the main streets to see some of the nicely renovated houses.", "author": "Tim L."}

From the food places to the different bars, there's a million and one things to do in this area. The culture, diversity, and atmosphere are a few of things that make me feel so comfortable and welcomed in this area. There are also a ton of small local businesses that are really great to find unique clothes and gifts. As for the food, I would say the Mission's staple is definitely Mexican and Hispanic food. There are so many delicious taquerias that I haven't even tackled half of them yet.

I have known it since the low riders would cruise down Mission Street.  It has gone through an interesting metamorphosis and I have a love hate feeling about that change.  I know that in the name of progress sometimes things must change, but in the name of progress... some will lose.  Those are the people that used to live in the neighborhood that have been displaced due to high rent, etc.  The Valencia corridor has become a hipster hang out and I am guilty of enjoying these places.

I've seen it change in a lot of ways.  Almost all for the better.  I find all those complaining about the \"marina-fication, or hipster\" nonsense disingenuous and are probably those who don't live in the hood just looking for a reason to look down their noses like they do at everything.  For the record, the Mission in the last decade has always been a mix ranging from sordid to elite.  There's nothing, not one thing, nada that's new about that.  All the spouting to the contrary is ignorance blaring at the top of its lungs.  \n\nThe Mission has some of the best weather in the city.  We are frequently warm and sunny when the rest of the city is cold and foggy and it's less windy than many neighborhoods. That's reason enough to live here for me.  I'd much rather sweat than shiver. \n\nResidents in our hood are incredibly diverse.  Artists, street people, professionals, scum and the general SF lot mix with great ease which is another reason I like it so much.  The Marina, Pac Heights, NoPa and so many other areas are just sterile, clone filled oases of boredom.  Not here I say.  I've met more interesting people living in the Mission than any other place in my lifetime. \n\nThe walking score in the Mission is off the hook.  You don't need to get on Muni, or in your car to find anything you need.  Restaurants, grocery, bars and shopping in tremendous variety and price-tags are all within just a few blocks.  It's entirely possible to buy $300 jeans at one spot and walk next door to a $1.25 taco.  Try doing that in the Marina or Pac Heights.  \n\nYes, the sidewalks are often dirty and the crowd on the street might be scary to the uninitiated, but in my decade of life in this hood I can say I've never encountered an instance where I felt unsafe or had any trouble of any kind on the streets and my car has never been vandalized.  I can't say the same for some other areas of town.  My car was broken into in Hayes Valley the only two times I was dumb enough to drive and park there.  \n\nI LOVE THE MISSION!  It's entirely too hip, too gritty, too old-school, too historic, too new, too unpretentious, too diverse, too cool and too comprehensive for all the small brains to understand it.  So to all you Mission downers pick it up and go hang in another hood.  Thousands of us love it and always will.", "author": "Russell D."}

Once they find their \"real job,\" they'll be outta here in less time than it takes to spot the nearest crackie. But for me, this is where I grew up. \n\nI have lived in the Mission all 24 years of my life. I went to Flynn Elementary, did grocery shopping at all the produce and meat markets on 24th Street with my mom, satisfied sugar cravings with 25 cent cookies at King's Bakery, etc. \n\nI understand why more and more people appreciate the Mission for what it is NOW, but would these same people have had such an affinity for it 10 years ago? What about 15 years ago? Back then it wasn't safe to be out on 24th or 18th after 4pm because of all the gang violence. Have you ever seen a grown man get pushed out of a bus window? Have you ever seen a kid get gutted in the back of the 14? Has your mom and her fellow shoppers ever been held hostage at a Casa Lucas? Has a random gunman ever showed up to your elementary school and stuck up two of your classmates for no reason? Did your elementary school have gun drills because stray bullets entered from the projects across the street? \n\nI can answer affirmatively to all of the above, as can other people who grew up in the old Mission. It's not that I miss all that ghetto shit, but at the same time I feel like I've lost an old friend. Because of TICs, people I grew up with were forced to relocate at the last minute. Mediocre coffee shops have replaced family-owned businesses that used to do a fine job of repairing your worn shoes or hemming that dress that was a few inches too long. Burritos can cost you up to $9. \n\nYet after all that, I still give my neighborhood four stars cuz you can't take the old Mission outta me (yeah, I still wear a mean mug cuz you had to wear a straight face as you walked past the cholos) and because I still live here.\n\n*Just as a disclaimer, the newbies I'm referring to our well-off people who can easily afford to live elsewhere, yet move into the Mission or the Tenderloin and displace families who struggle to make ends meet.\n\nPS: I don't understand why anyone would give this review Funny votes.

This bitch took me down dark streets and nobody fucked with us.

I would say born and raised, since I'm a San Francisco native, but my parents lived in the Richmond and Sunset while I was born before moving to the Mission when I was five. So I remember the dangerous days of gang shootings heard from outside to the '89 earthquake and the reaction of my neighborhood... when Cesar Chavez Elementary was called by its REAL name: Hawthorne Elementary (even BEFORE the mural went up.)\n\nI remember it all... before the hipsters came to live and the yuppies came to hang out. A lot of the original locals here moved out when they began tearing down the buildings in exchange for more expensive condos and the suburbanites that moved in.\n\nAt first, I didn't think it was appropriate to say it, but since I'm half white, I think I can say it... and apologize to my mom's side later... the white people moved in and it was an entirely new place. I don't know when it happened. Maybe when I left for college and came back? Not really sure... it went from being afraid to wear red or blue to avoiding the pretentiousness of the hipsters. Sure, it's a less dangerous here, but it lost a lot of its coolness.\n\nIs Capp Street still infested with $5 whores? I'm just wondering. (Updated Note: True story... I was about 12 walking along 21st and South Van Ness after playing some arcade games with some friends when I got propositioned by a prostitute and her pimp. She wasn't that bad looking, compared to some of the nastier prostitutes in the area... but come on! I was fucking 12! What kind of money would a 12 year old have? She must have been REALLY cheap and, sadly, REALLY desperate. I digress.)\n\nAnyways, I have a lot of fond memories here... and a lot of bad ones. There's some good restaurants here and some overrated ones. The streets are dirty but that never bothered me. There's this one homeless guy that I kinda befriended who's probably no longer with us... or he's in another part of the City... I really don't know. And then there's one who's just holding out his hand, doing nothing, hoping for a handout. Lamer. There's some cool shops, and there's some I don't bother with.\n\nFor nostalgic purposes, I can't give the Mission anything less than three stars... but for the gentrification and becoming Marina with Mexican restaurants (ok, that's not totally true.... but it sure feels like it sometimes), I can't give it anything higher than three. That and 16th and Mission. That place is STILL a dump, despite the construction on the outside of the BART stations. I've always been a 24th Street kid, I guess.\n\nOn a positive note, they've got a Good Vibes here... so it can't be THAT bad :)", "author": "Chris S."}

As a result, most Mission taquerias are full of dudes sporting the Paul Bunyon look and girls who keep diaries. As mentioned above, buche and cabeza don't come in the Boca variety. Thus, the ever savvy business owner started shitting down the menu like an episode of Oz. Meat got bland, spices got dull, and prices went up, (for more information, see the city of SF as a whole). Places like Pancho Villa, that back in the day used to serve fried blood, have gone the Chipotle route. Yeah, maybe Beck shows up there now and then, but who the fuck cares? Like his music, the food there is a total rimjob. \n\nWhat about Cancun, El Farolito, La Altena, etc? Yeah, them shits is ok. They're about as good as any taco stand in any Central Valley town.

Bart is NEVER as crowded as MUNI even at rushhour.  The weather - the mission has better weather than anywhere else in the city.  Love all the warmth and the sunshine.  Sometimes I actually start to believe that I truly live in California.   Also, there is no shortage of bars and cheap places to eat - good for anyone on a budget.   Also, the Mission has some of the most beautiful and colorful murals.  Fun just to walk down the streets and check out all the free urban art! \n\nThe Cons - people who live in the Mission seem to think that the sidewalks and the little grassy areas around the trees constitute garbage cans. When I take my puppy out, it's difficult to find any grassy patch for her to go potty that doesn't have broken glass, used condoms, other dogs \"business\", or some other variety of trash in it.  C'mon people - pick up after your pets and hold on to your garbage until you find a garbage can.  There's no shortage of them!  \n\nAlso, all the convience stores around my house close between 8-10, WTF?  In the lower haight, convenience stores were open until midnight at least!  Frustrating to have to scour your neighborhood for an open convenience store at 11PM on Saturday night!   Not to mention for a neighborhood with the best weather in the city, there's a noticable lack of outdoor seating at restaurant and bars.   I would figure that with the nice weather, the Mission could become more like North beach in terms of outdoor seating. \n\nAnd while I've never felt particularly threatened in the Mission, the recent rash of violence, culminating in the deaths of 2 of my best friends' co-workers, has me a little uneasy, to say the least.  \n\nAll in all, the Mission is kinda cool - but I think I'd rather live in Noe Valley...", "author": "Alison L."}

PG & E created a little filth zone under the freeway that people felt obliged to contribute to, including a case of petroleum jelly that busted open and DPW apparently never got around to cleaning. It got more and more gruesome and is now a stain that steam cleaning might get out, maybe. BART renovated the plazas at 16th Street and used paving stones so cheap and porous that they were filthy before they were even open to the public, and nothing will get the grime out, ever. I went on BART today thinking about Yelpers going on about how dirty the Mission is. Ever notice how dirty the BART trains are? \n\nThe Mission is filthy come to think of it. And it pisses me off, thanks for reminding me. But have you been to Alioto Park at Capp and 20th? Considering the neighborhood, there's no reason why it should be so nice. But it is nice. Kids play there, crazy people take refuge there, people garden there, cholos smoke pot in there, there's something for everyone. Alioto Park is just one of the 1000 things I love about the Mission.

This neighborhood started getting too much attention after the dot-com thang. I knew we were in trouble when Prez Clinton and Mick Jagger were seen dining at the (old) Slated Door. Please continue writing bad reviews of the Mission so people don't come here unless they want to be here for the right reasons.\n\nWhat, you ask, are the right reasons, and who do you think you are for being so presumptuous (my spelling sucks) as to declare those reasons? Huh? Well, I am nobody special, but I have lived mostly in the Mission for the past 14 years. That makes me a dinosaur. Here are the reasons I love the mission and I hope these reasons inspire others:\n\nPublic Art: I will never forget strolling down Mission St. at night and happening across and entirely free concert by Rube Wadell. They would play a full set under the awning of Leeds (now Sketchers). On another random day strolling in an alley between 25th and 26th I find a full-on altar, complete with offerings. Walking down my street I discover my neighbors have dragged a bath tub out front of their house covered it with broken tiles and filled it with soil and plants. Some person used to post ceramic tile hearts all over the mission, another ties brightly covered yarn strands all over the abandoned locks and bicylces left on meters and street signs. I have never seen any other place so passionately devoted to public art as this neighborhood. I mean just look at all the murals. That in and of itself justifies having to step in the occasional desposit of doodoo or whatever. Everytime I see that free public art my heart leaps. And.  I get to see it everyday.\n\nReason 2: Diversity. This is the only place in SF I know where you can regularly see old people and children. Nearly every other neighborhood is filled with 20-30 something types who never reproduce and have seemingly not been spawned from anyone from a previous generation. It's like they all sprang from the head of Zeus, or something. No so the Mish. When I walk down the street I see hipsters (whose clothing I appreciate as more public art) gangsters, kids, grandmas, overworked and harried mothers pushing strollers, homeless people, immigrants, basically a fun mix of people people way richer than me and people who make me quietly appreciate that I have as much as I do. I don't know why this makes me happy, but it does, all these years later.\n\nReason 3 : The weather. It's always sunny in the Mission.\n\nReason 4: Buying food in the Mission is ridiculously cheap, especially on 24th st.\n\nHaving said all of this, I am ready to leave here in 2 years or so. My son will become a teen soon and while I feel very safe here, I don't consider it a safe place for a teen to live based what I've been told by friends who grew up here. But this will always be my favorite neighborhood in the world and I am confident that when my sons are grown and gone I will return.", "author": "ellen c."}

I'll never argue with that.  If you're writing a review based on running around on 16th street, or immediately surrounding blocks on Valencia/Mission  . . . I'll let you in on a little secret . . .alot of the residents avoid that area particularly from Thurs-Sat 1) because of you 2) because we're not fools and KNOW its rough.   If you lived in that area and dig it you are a more patient person than I, no judgment intended, its just not for me. IF however, your are judging an ENTIRE diverse neighborhood based on what is arguably its least attractive attribute . . . I am judging you. \n\nI live in the mission because of its COMMUNITY. Where else can you find day laborers, progressive yuppies with incredibly well-dressed babies, hipsters, young, old  and  immigrant families (mostly latino/a) that have been here and built a culture here for at least two generations? Answer . . . Brooklyn or Queens, NY and maybe somewhere in LA but really, if you're in SF you don't want to live in LA and the weather here will ruin you for BK. \n\nAs for the Mission/Marina ridiculousness. Many in the Mission (myself included) have been guilty of using \"The Marina\" as short hand for the kind of person who does not value a diverse community (and yes, where there is diversity life is a little more complex) or an independent spirit.  Most of us know better and let's not kid ourselves, I have seen many MANY a group of ethnically/racially uniform Mission residents running around in nearly identical \"hipster chic\" outfits.  Similarly,  I've heard Marina residents use the Mission as short hand for aloof, inauthentic scensters or alternatively some sort of crime-ridden den of filth. Well kids, I've been out around up there and guess what, the population of aloof, inauthentic scenesters is pretty darn high.  And yeah, it can be dirtier here, but don't hate, just get on case of SFPD or Sanitation to care as much about this neighborhood as it does about yours.  \n\nSo I'm not in the STAY OUT camp . . . I love it when people come and check the great parts of where I live (well, until I can't get a table . . . and then I get a little grumbly, but I generally get over it).", "author": "Jen A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-07-06", "description": "To simply write The Mission off as a vile cesspit of filth & depravity (which is true in many ways) would be, I think, oversimplifying matters.  But to say that it is grossly overrated would be fairly accurate.  I have very mixed feelings about The Mission, to be sure, and I will do my best to articulate them here.  Let me begin by clarifying that I am not a Mission Hater.  To the contrary, my arrival in San Francisco was THROUGH The Mission, and I, too, once believed it to be the center of the known universe (I have since come to my senses, however).  So, where to begin?  How about that cesspit factor?  It is fairly strong.  Mission STREET is about as disgusting as you can get, complete with crackheads, heroin addicts, drug dealers, prostitutes, gang bangers, mentally ill people, and a constant, lingering stench of alcohol & urine.  It is rivaled in its repugnance only by The Tenderloin, the only neighborhood in San Francisco which manages to be WORSE (hard to imagine, but true).  People speak of gentrification as if it's a dirty word, but in the case of the Mission, it is a much-needed force, because much of it is absolutely disgusting.  There are great restaurants & bars on & around Mission St, yes, but the fact that you have to fight your way THROUGH, and step OVER the above-mentioned degenerates is a real downer.  As one makes their way West, over to Valencia & Guerrero Streets, however, things change quite a bit.  Valencia St, in contrast to Mission St, is much more habitable, with lots of bars, restaurants & cafes to choose from (there's still quite a bit of sketch up at 16th, though).  The negative, once one arrives at Valencia St, however, is The Hipster Factor.  Make no mistake that once you get there, you are in the stronghold of the Hipster Movement in San Francisco, and I find it every bit as nauseating as The Marina.  I can't even bring myself to ENTER such establishments as Ritual Coffee Roasters, despite the indisputable quality of their product.  The scene there is just too much to bear (see my review of Ritual Coffee Roasters for the full story).  Still, there are some gems: Amnesia (one of my favorite bars), Range (always quality), Tartine, Delfina, Little Star, Ti Couz...  These places are all great.  But the overall grit of The Mission, combined with the tragic Hipster vibe can sometimes be a bit overwhelming.  I must also speak of this sort of chip that many Missionites have on their shoulder, that makes them believe that The Mission is just inherently superior to all other neighborhoods in San Francisco.  I remain unconvinced of this argument.  San Francisco is full of cool, vibrant neighborhoods, each with something to offer.  And The Mission gets far too much credit, in my opinion.  The Mission is good IN DOSES, but I wouldn't want to live there.  You owe it to yourself to familiarize yourself with some of San Francisco's other neighborhoods, as they have great things to offer, and are often overlooked in favor of The Mission's cooler image.", "author": "Eric H."}

I have never run into any problems, never been shot at, except maybe tripping over some drunk lying on  the ground.  I must agree that it is dirty so don't wear your nice shoes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-13", "description": "First I want to point out to previous reviewers that Duboce Park and Buena Vista park aren't in the mission.  They're nice parks, but different neighborhoods.\n\nAnyways, I was born in SF, and raised in SF, in Noe Valley, and I'm still living here (was born in the Mission in fact, at St. Luke's).   Went to school in the Mission, my best friend lived there (and still does), and I spent--and still spend--plenty of time chilling there.  There is crime, gang violence, grit, but damn what a neighborhood.  I feel more at home in the Mission than almost anywhere in the city, except for maybe the block I grew up on.  It's changing though, and just about everything from Valencia Westwards is basically Mission District lite.  Less and less working class people and immigrants, and more and more upper class white yuppies, hipsters, etc, etc.  I remember when there were crackheads and shootings in Dolores Park.  The police would ride dirtbikes through it, and up and down the steps.  The pedestrian bridge used to be a drug-dealing hotspot that my mom would warn me about.  I also remember when homies would have parades of Lowriders rolling around at random times, and I remember when the burritos at La Taqueria were actually 3 bucks, and Valencia was still a little bit cutty.  For all the change though, I still love it, and in some ways I'll admit, I love it more.  From 24th street and Valencia to Potrero.  Harrison Street, Bryant Street, the old warehouses and factories by the central freeway (wandering around the area as a kid, finding all sorts of interesting...and grimy, disgusting shit).  South Van Ness and Folsom, Back down to Cesar Chavez, and up along Mission, all the way to from the Daly City to the Embarcadero.  You can take Mission Street out of the Mission, but you can't take the Mission out of Mission Street (alright, maybe you can...Downtown, starting at about 5th Eastwards).     \n\nFOOD:\n\nLa Taqueria, 25th and Mission\nLa Corneta, 24th and Mission\nTaqueria San Jose, Mission between 24th and 25th\nTaqueria San Vicente, 25th and Mission\nEl Farolito, 24th and Mission\nPancho Villa, 16th between Mission and Valencia\nMi Tierra, South Van Ness and 14th\nMi Lindo Yucatan, Valencia and 15th\nLa Palma, 24th and Florida\nLa Victoria, 24th and Alabama\nDianda's, 25th and Mission\nTartine, 18th and Guerrero\nPork Store Cafe, 16th and Valencia\nBombay Ice Cream, Valencia between 16th and 17th\nBi Rite Ice Cream and Market, 18th between Dolores and Guerrero\nFritz or frjtz or however the hell you spell it, just down from Bombay\nTaco Bell on Valencia and Hill (RIP)\nTaco Bell at Valencia and Mission (RIP)\nPapolote, 24th and Valencia\nBig Mouth Burgers, 24th and Valencia\nPopeye's, Mission and 22nd\n\nThose last three have special meaning for me from my middle school days.  I was at both Big Mouth and Papalote on their grand openings, and me and my friends became cool with the owners, and we would get free food all the time.  Sadly, I don't think that would work anymore.  As for Popeye's there's something alluring to a 12 year-old about eating at a fast food chicken place (that's better than KFC) where 5 people were shot the day before. \n\n\nOther stuff...You have pawn shops, 99 cent stores, latin music stores and drug stores, hundreds of corner stores, mexican and asian markets, bookstores, coffeeshops, boutiques sprouting on Valencia, autobody shops, funeral homes,  the only gun store in the City, an open air drug market anywhere east of Valencia and north of Cesar Chavez...\n\nGetting Drunk:\n\nThe Dovre\nZeitgeist\nClooney's (the epitome of a dive bar.  The first time i went there, there was a fight within two minutes literally, between a tall skinny white dude, and a chubby, shirtless, tattooed-up homie...it seemed to have started over a pool game.  The bartender lady knew them both by name and yelled at them to leave before she called the cops...and they hung their heads and obliged, as if she were their mother, heh.  I also have fond memories of watching the old drunks stagger out of the place at 11 in the morning, as a kid)\n\nGetting Drunk.  Not bars:\n\nDolores Park\nPoplar Alley\nHouse Parties on 24th and Florida\nSecret spot at St. Luke's Hospital.  Even better on the 4th of July.  \n\nGenerally: stay west of Valencia, and you can play it safe, but still be there and experience many great things.  Go east and you'll find it cheaper and more diverse, as well as dirtier, more hectic and at times dangerous.  Also those who have mentioned the filthy breed of bum that resides in the Mission, you are correct.  They must have spawned in hell and then climbed out through the shower drain in some boarded up crackhouse on Shotwell street.", "author": "c b."}

Mission Street is still old school (yes, i know there's Foreign Cinema - which i love - but it's still good.)  and who said there are no good places to eat???

Don't be a sourpuss! quit your grousing!\n\nYes it's dirty, yes, there are crack hos, shootings, and the occasional human feces sighting (huh-if that's what's bugging you, don't even THINK about living in downtown Oakland.)
