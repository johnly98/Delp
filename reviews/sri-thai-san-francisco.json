They've let me down in the past but they're on an upswing right now. \n\nMy last 2 orders have been pleasing and I'm happy to give a higher than average review.\n\nI always say I either give 1 star or 5 stars- otherwise I'm not inspired to write up a review. \n\nBut Sri Thai has the same caliber Thai food as most other places but charges a few dollars less. As long as they keep delivering food that's hot and fresh they'll rerain my 4-star review. \n\nAnd, God willing, if they put more ingredients in the Tom Kha, and make my food spicy with peppers instead of including hot sauce instead, they may get 5 stars!!!\n\nBy the way - their calamari is AMAZING - but only order it in the restaurant.", "author": "Grizzle J."}

The nicest feature is the yelp delivery or pickup orders, they're rather prompt so you aren't stuck waiting an hour or so for your food. \n\nAs for the food itself, it's good ol' Thai food so curries, pad thai, pad kee mow, and the usual good stuff. It's a pretty varied menu so try not to panic order too much. That's really all there is to it, sit down, order affordable thai food, and enjoy a nice meal.", "author": "Derek T."}

Their attitude that is!  \n\nCame here on father's day for the first time since most places were packed or closing.  We called to RSVP & got hung up before we finish leaving our name.\n\nHowever, I got here thinking that ima let that go and just chill!  Ambience seemed decent, spacious table for our family of 5 + an 8 mos old infant.  The food was fair with some good & bad dishes.  \n\nFOOD TIP:\n\nRoasted Duck Curry: Spot on with the duck. Somewhat crunch on the outer skin and not too fatty.  The curry was not spicy and good. \n\nGreen Curry w/ Beef: Beef what somewhat tough but it's ok because the curry was very good.  Kinda spicy (just right for me) \n\nTom Kah Soup: Dirty shrimp with poop still all in there (not cleaned), but the soup was good.  You just have to pick out your own SHRIMP POO \n\nPad Thai: OK; mediocre\nPad See Ew: OK; mediocre, on the sweet side, not my go to dish here\n\nBrown Rice: Good but there are grainy parts so if you don't like that type of texture don't order this.  It's $2 each bowl to go with the a la crate dishes and curries.\n\nWAITRESS RECOMMENDATION: Salmon & Eggplant:  Salmon did not taste fresh.  No flavoring besides fishy fishy ocean yuck with some bone bits in it. Eggplant was good.  They don't compliment each other; living in their own world in that dish.  FAIL recommendation.\n\nTotal: 3-4 star for food, but this is why they deserve 1 star\n\nNASTY WAITRESS!!  \n\nWe had an 8 mos old at our table, my infant baby niece.  All she does (like all babies) is eat, sleep, play, cry, scream, and baby talks with high and low vocals.  With this said she's also a girl so yes sometimes her pitch can be high.  I looked around & notice the guy behind our table laughing & giggling hard with us b/c he knows how random babies are.  (8yr old at his table) I'd laugh if I heard someone else's baby do that too.  \nThe next thing I notice was the same waitress (PAT or PACK) who gave me poor food recommendations glaring with burning angry eyes right at my niece (the baby).  I thought it was a fluke.  maybe she just have an RBF (resting bitch face) which is natural for some people LOL... since she had that pissed look from the beginning, I just thought it was normal for her & ignored it.  \n\nHowever, she suddenly became confrontational with us & told us in front of the entire restaurant to SHUSHHHH quiet & keep it down in a very disrespectful way.  It was not discrete or quiet, she looked like she want to strangle the infant!  WE WERE pretty quiet, besides baby random vocals of self blabbering & random screams..she's an 8 mos infant, just wow...!  Thought I was on the show WWYD (What Would You Do)! HAAAAaa & John Quinones was gonna come out & say we got yoU!!  WRONG!!\n\nwe are suppose to somehow silent the infant.  Or should we feel guilty for taking baby out for a family day for father's day???  \n\nDespite what we thought inside you know we told the waitress sure yes, we'll keep it down.  My sister in law (SIL) tried to hush the baby, gave her pacifier, swing her around, (can't eat while she's doing this obviously), all sorts of baby comforting things... I mean what else can we do besides leave??? I wish they would have told us from the gecko like hey this is not an infant baby friendly place, but no... just straight up embarrass & humiliate us after they rob our money.  In the middle of eating, shut up or gtfo kind of attitude... OokKayyyy there.... \n\nSo my SIL was going to write a review saying this place is not baby friendly to warn others, so asked another server for the RBF server's name (PAT/PACK) -I'll call her \"P\" for short. Suddenly P freaks out & does her weird DEATH STARE straight at my SIL with piercing eyes & said \"WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM\", so my SIL explained that it is practically impossible to control an infant baby's random sounds; how can we silence a baby?  P again freaks out & points at my SIL right in front of the whole restaurant & yells, \"YOU ARE THE MOM, you STOP your baby! OTHER MOMS STOP THEIR BABIES!\" Like OMG my jaw drops! How rude is that to say to your customer??  So we find out she's not a mom but she's judging someone else's parenting abilities & embarrasses us in front of the whole restaurant... I THOUGHT WWYD. JOhn Quinones can come out now because that is just something out of a TV!  Such NASTY NASTY attitude from P the waitress!  \n\nSo fellow foodies, please beware of this place.  They are NOT infant/kids/children friendly unless you have a mute.\n\nWith this poor dramatic experience, I really felt bad for my Dad who had to sit there & watch this like a show for Father's day.  I really regret taking him here.  I wish it was different.  I wish P would just learn how to be a proper respectful human being so that she don't ruin people's happy day with her negative vibe, poor energy, and doom and gloom demeanor.  With that said, I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone with families or friends who have smaller ones to bring.  \n\nDon't think I'll be back!", "author": "Juila L."}

Server name Pat, Pak or Lek was beyond rude. I have never experience anything like it. NEVER. I have a 8 month old baby that likes to sing or scream. Halfway into dinner, Pat/Pak/Lek came to our table and told us to \"SHHHH...quiet and keep it down...keep your baby quiet\".. yes a baby! My baby wasn't even crying at the restaurant at all, she was just just practicing her vocals. Not once did my baby cry inside the rstaurant. Pat/Pak/Lek didn't even ask us nicely, she was rude as hell. I have never in all my years (15+ years) of working at restaurants have EVER asked any of my customers to tell their baby to be quiet. What kind of sick human being does that? This is unbelievable. \n \nI was already holding my baby and putting a binky in her mouth. She was not crying. She was just singing randomly and doing baby blabbers like what babies naturally do.\n\nI asked the other server Tanya what that rude server's name was... it was Pat or Pak or Lek, And I was gonna just write a review on yelp to warn my fellow yelpers...btw Tanya the nice server was super apologetic because she probably was in disbelieve too at how stupid and ridiculous her co worker is.\n\nBut then Pat had the audacity to stare me down at the register and mug at me and ask \"what is your problem\"? She walks around and mugs at my baby. HAHAHA this bitch! I should be the one to ask what the hell her problem is. She tried to argue with me that it's a public place and people should be quiet at restaurants. Is there a sign that says no kids allowed? I asked her if she had any kids, and of course she said no. Oh thank god! She doesn't have any kids bc she would probably be one of those assholes caught on youtube that beats their kids up. She tried to yell back at me and was not apologetic at all. Not only did she sound and look stupid AF, she then goes to another table of customer n tried to justify that she was correct. Like her being rude to us can be justify. I told the customer what happened, and the other customer felt bad too. When my baby was singing and babbling, the table behind us with children was laughing and saying how cute she was. I don't know what the server's problem is. Maybe she is mad she isn't able to celebrate father's day and instead she is working? \n\nThe server yelled at us to quiet an 8 month old, that wasn't even crying. And had the nerve to keep yelling at us. I hope she gets fired and I feel bad if she ever have kids on her own. I feel bad for all the bad ass karma she is going to have. \n\nI told Pat/Pak/Lek that I wanted to speak with the owner. She said the owner was inside the kitchen. Tanya said the owner wasn't here and was super apologetic. I hope the owner can see how rude this server is. No one should be paid for that kinda \"service\".", "author": "Tammy F."}

I placed a delivery on Eat24, and it gave a generic delivery time of 45 to 85 minutes.  After 90 minutes we called, and the person on the phone said they didn't see the order until a half hour after I placed it.  So that means they don't pay much attention to that system, it's probably best to call in your order here.  \n\nWe got our food late, and for the most part, it wasn't very good.  The portions were small.  The pad thai was one of the worst we've had (reminded us of instant).  The fresh roll was cut poorly and had no flavor.  It was difficult to get a piece without ripping it apart since it wasn't cut all the way through.  The spicy basil crispy duck, while it had good flavor, seemed more like spicy beef jerky with a couple of duck pieces.  It may very well have all been duck, but most of the pieces of meat were too dry to be able to tell.  The tom kha soup was actually very tasty, not too sour, very creamy.  However, it didn't have very many ingredients in it, it was mostly broth.\n\nThe late delivery and subpar food in small portions won't have me ordering from here again anytime soon.", "author": "Jon B."}

I don't normally like carrots in my curry but here they are slices so thinly that they are still a little crunchy and taste really great.

At most Thai food restaurants you are given a choice of spice level however not the case here.  Last time I was in SF we ordered in from here and thought the food was very bland so I remembered to ask this time.  Glad I did!  Made a huge difference.  The reason for a low rating is that the fried appetizers we ordered were still cold in the middle, obviously cooked from a frozen state.

Pad Himapan chicken is one of my favorite meals. I've ordered & devoured it for 15+ years.  It was there when I first moved into the neighborhood.  It was THE dish. It was the stay at home, order takeout, and rent a movie dish.  It was what I craved when I was pregnant.  It was the, \"take my son out to eat lunch on a Saturday afternoon dish.\" It has been a consistent in my life.  \n\nUnfortunately, as the years have gone by the dish has changed.  I know I must sound like a crazy person.   The potions have gotten smaller and smaller.  The bell peppers cut into huge slices and huge green onions thrown on top serving no real purpose. (Make the portion look bigger?) Sigh.  The chicken & sauce are still awesome, but alas the veggie portion needs some help.  My family rarely orders from Sri Thai anymore because we know how it use to be.  The grilled chicken entree was once big enough for 2 adults and a kid. We use to order once a week and even received Christmas cards from them.  I LOVE supporting my local restaurants and will probably still order from them certain dishes.  The Wo Sen soup is excellent when you are sick , and my son lives their sticky rice with mango.  \n\nI guess just like everything else in this city, change is inevitable.

You have to order rice with the curry because it doesn't come with which is kind of a bummer, but that's pretty standard across the board. The tea came out very quickly and was delicious; there's something about Thai tea that really gets me. The curry was delicious- spicy, but extremely flavorful. I left very satisfied.\n\nAll in all, I had a very positive experience at Sri Thai and would highly recommend you check it out; support the local businesses!

None of the food that we had was very good or authentic. THE ONLY REASON I EVEN CONSIDERED THIS PLACE WAS BECAUSE IT HAD A 4 STAR RATING.  THANKS YELP!\n\nWe had two bowls of the the Tom Yum soup.  One with shrimp and one with chicken.  This is a very staple soup for a Thai place and should be an indicator of whether or not the food will be any good.  Well, this is when I first doubted the 4 star rating that this place has.\n\nThe soup was watery, bland, and overly sour.  I believe there were only a few pieces of chicken or shrimp in each bowl.  I was already put off that there were no family options for the soup, but the flavor and quality were sub par.\n\nMy Thai iced tea came after that.  This was more of a syrup than a drink.  It was extremely sweet, and when I asked if they could water it down with some tea, they only offered me hot tea.  This means that the Thai tea base was pre-mixed.  It just gets worse and worse doesn't it?\n\nNext up was the papaya salad.  This salad was just sad.  It came on a tiny plate, and if that wasn't enough, there was a bed of iceberg lettuce underneath it.  This was obviously a cost saving tactic.  The taste was also off as it wasn't spicy and definitely didn't have enough peanuts.\n\nThen came the pad see ew and the pineapple fried rice.  Both were embarrassingly small portions.  On top of that the pineapple fried rice was burnt.  BURNT!  There were specs of black in it.\n\nLast to come were the pumpkin curry and the green Thai curry.  Not much to say about either of these, except that I think they may have mixed up the sugar and the salt.  I know Thai curries are sweet, but these were practically deserts!  Also the pumpkin curry just tasted like a red curry with pumpkins in it.  If that were the case, it should of been listed as red curry, you can choose if you want pumpkin thrown in.\n\nI hope this makes you as disappointed as my stomach was last night.  Go to King of Thai instead.  You get the food quicker and it tastes better.", "author": "Eddie C."}

There was little chicken in the entire dish, maybe 4-5 small bites' worth, and what chicken was there was nearly cold. (This was despite the food arriving thirty minutes before expected delivery, which was initially a pleasant surprise.) The food was not spicy in the least; it was fairly bland, and oddly stuffed with carrots.

Was craving some kind of Asian food once my family and I got back from a camping trip and didn't want to go back out into the world after a long drive back home and unpacking.\n\nHighlight: The wonton wrapped shrimp.  Crispy and tasty with two sauces that were not too overpowering.  I liked dipping the shrimp in both the sweet and sour and soy sauce with pepper sauces. \n\nOther items we had were A-OK.\nPad Thai Tofu: This may taste better if eaten at the restaurant.  When I was taking my portion of the pad thai from the delivery plastic container, the noodles were clumped into one big irregular ball of noodles.  The pad thai had big pieces of broccoli and I'm assuming burnt pieces of flattened scrambled eggs.  There was something off about the noodles.  I still can't really figure out what was off about the taste of the pad thai....  I ended up finishing most of the noodles anyways because my husband didn't want to eat any more of it even though he was the one that suggested pad thai noodles over pad sae ew.  Should have gone with pad saw ew.  More often than not, that's the safer choice.\n\nPapaya Salad:  Vegetables were crunchy but the dressing could have been brighter.  Dressing tasted watery.\n\nBBQ Duck:  The duck was not overpowered with saltiness or sweetness, which I find happens often at various other places that offer BBQ duck.  It was a good balance between the two, so I was able to enjoy the flavor of the duck meat.  I also appreciated that there were decent amounts of meat given to us.  There's been a lot of places where I've been given a lot of bone and not a whole lot of meat.  At Sri Thai, that was not the case.\n\nI have been to Sri Thai several times before, and honestly, it's been a hit and miss.  I really want to enjoy the food here because it's so close to home and there aren't a lot of options in the Outer Sunset.

I looked up delivery on Yelp and called this place out of the blue.  The very polite lady answering the phone took my order, despite my hypoglycemia-induced indecision over what to get.  There was a $15 delivery minimum charge, but no delivery fee...so I had to order two entrees (no problem - now I have lunch for the next day).  She recommended that I get the pad see yew with beef (\"it's really yummy that way,\" she says), and I also ordered a pad thai with chicken.  They take American Express, hooray!  She tells me it will be 45 minutes....how will I survive that long??  I had to have a snack.\n\nAnyway, food finally arrives (it was an accurate time estimate, unfortunately for my hungry tummy).  Very nice delivery guy.  I decide to eat the pad thai and save the pad see yew for tomorrow's lunch.  First thing I notice when I open the bag is that something smells a bit stinky.  I open the pad thai container and I realize it's the cabbage that is on the top of my dish.  I don't think I've ever seen pad thai with cabbage before (bean sprouts, of course..but cabbage?).  Anyway, I dug in, pushing the cabbage aside.  I wasn't blown away, but it was decent.  The chicken was a bit dry (as it sometimes is when they slice it really thin in Thai food) and the flavor was only okay.  But I ate half, and saved the rest.\n\nI ended up eating the pad see yew for two meals as well.  It was much better.  The beef was really good (I strongly recommend this over the chicken!) and I liked that the broccoli was just al dente and not mushy at all (a pet peeve of mine is mushy vegetables!).  The flavor was good, and there was plenty of beef and egg in there.  The only thing is that it was kind of oily.  But it was goooood.\n\nFor saving me from hunger and the good flavor and quality of the beef pad see yew, this place gets 4 stars and a pledge from me to order again to try more things.

They also packed the curry in a nice, spill-proof container which was legit. The spring rolls were pretty ho-hum, nothing too exciting. They weren't very flavorful and I didn't care for the sauce that they served with them so I would recommend passing on these.", "author": "Sam F."}

I've probably had close to 5 Sri Thai banquets on my bed. Maybe I'm lazy, but who else gets home after 9 hours of work and loses the will to do anything including cook? Probably most normal humans. On these such occasions, Sri Thai hasn't let me down. \n\nIt goes without saying, but they're always great to work with. Friendly and receptive phone service, and rapid delivery results. Not to mention their prices are very reasonable. \n\nI always go with an order of Tom Kha. Always. It's literally hot perfection in a bowl. The coconut makes it deliciously creamy and thick, but the lemony flavors keep that in check. I've never liked mushrooms until Tom Kha entered my stomach, and Sri Thai's makes mushrooms kind of crazy good. \n\nThe Pad Thai is great -- lots of flavor, lovely texture, and is always a go-to dish. Same goes for the Pad See Ew. Order with confidence! \n\nChicken skewers are darn tasty -- slather them in peanut sauce and blow each tiny mind in each of your tiny taste buds. \n\nOne day I might make it to Sri Thai and actually sit in their restaurant, but the great service and tasty food I get in my bedroom might delay that occasion.", "author": "Chelsea B."}

I hate going to a thai restaurant that serves subtle flavor, I think we can all agree that subtle thai food is an oxymoron. My friend order fried chicken over thai fried rice and I was a bit envious of his choice. Usually the fried rice that comes with the fried chicken is pretty basic, but damn it was good. Enough to make me want to order it on its own without the chicken. I myself ordered the pepper and garlic pork and it was gone shortly after it touched the table. I might have left 2-3 grains of rice which I usually would clean up but was too lazy from a stomach full of food, portions are appropriate for a hungry man. And it was cheap. Most dishes under 9. Decor was lovely, dark and warm, like most thai places I'm akin to. They dress up their place a little more than usual with the waitresses in very traditional looking dresses. Close to the beach so there's plenty of parking. How nice to walk on the beach to your car after dinner? I bike but, how nice anyways. Will def go back.", "author": "Elton F."}

So far, this is the best place I've ever had green curry. The ambiance is nice. Nice lights, wine bottles everywhere, clean, not crowded, fast & friendly service. Couldn't ask for more in that aspect.\n\nI always check a restaurant's reviews and menu online before going to a place and I like their system for online ordering. They deliver or you can pick up. Prices are good too.\n\nI'll go over the food we had there now:\n\nGreen curry - thick and soupy. Just the right spiciness. I liked the addition of cucumbers, which tasted very good with the curry. Chicken tends to get overcooked as usual with curries. Everything in the dish went well.\n\nSpicy Fried Snapper - The breading was kinda tough to cut through with the spoon. They didn't give us knives lol but it was tasty. The \"red curry\" was moreso just a spicy sweet & sour sauce. The fried basil leaves on top were delicious! Kinda like really thin potato chips, but they were tasty basil leaves!\n\nBrown rice - They had run out of white rice for the night and gave us the brown rice for the white rice price :) That makes me happy. I could hardly tell it was brown rice, but it still had that slight chewiness that brown rice has. Very plump though!\n\nWanted to try the fried banana and ice cream, but we were too full.\n\nWoulda gave this place 5 stars if we didn't get the runs a little the next day :\\ but I'd still come back hahaha it tastes good and a little bit of extra bowel movements won't hold me back!", "author": "Timothy L."}

The red curry tasted good and the consistency and the portions were pretty good. The only downside was that it was missing the aromas that make Thai curries stand out. In addition, they also made it medium spicy when we asked for extra thai hot. The Spicy noodles were very tasty and it's definitely a dish that would drag me back to this place. \n\nThis my criticism when it comes to most of the Thai places in the bay area. Not giving a side order of rice for something you can only eat with rice seems a bit sneaky way of charging higher prices...and then charging for a refill of rice seems that much more unfair. I really hope Thai places change this. Here at least for me, the side of rice wasn't large enough to go with the curry portions.", "author": "Ravi C."}

What went on in this guys lil mind in those 2 seconds i'll never know, but he thought of something, perhaps something totally irrelevant like \"oh I can't wait for American Idol tonight\", and then turned his back to me and continued walking to his car.\n\n\nWTF? asshole...", "author": "Belito L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-18", "description": "Since moving to the Outer Sunset, I've made a point of visiting local neighborhood restaurants as much as possible. I've had both the pleasure and misfortune to eat at Sri Thai, several times.\n\nFirst let me say, that the service is always friendly. I feel completely welcomed when I'm in this cozy nook. However friendliness does not make up for, lack of experience or ability to judiciously guide diners.\n\nI am not an expert on Thai food, and unfortunately, the people who have served me at Sri Thai, are fairly non-commital about their menu. Seeming to need direction from their diners, they most often nod and smile at my questions, and can rarely offer anything of substance in regards to menu suggestions.\n\nThe food is hit or miss.\nPumpking Curry - Very Good, though there is an issue with their coconut milk. (see below)\nTheir 'vegetarion' Thai Samosas are absolutely exceptional! I order them everytime I've gone in. Crispy, light and delicious.\n\nBeverage choices are lacking - no Green Tea? Seriously?\nBlack Tea is too bitter for me and Thai Tea to sweet.\n\nThen there's the coconut milk.\nI love Tom-Kha, as well as most Curries, but there is something off with their coconut milk. It has a thick, almost gluey mouth feel, that leaves me slightly repulsed. It tastes fine, but for some reason, my brain interprets that texture as 'Gone Off', and I cannot enjoy the dish.\nI had hoped it was a one time thing, but each time I've ordered something with coconut milk, I get the same effect.\nI have no idea if it's the product, or possibly the cooking method - but it makes any dish containing it, unplatable for me.\n\nOn top of that, there is the price. Frankly, just too high for Thai.\n\nCertainly not the worst food, or dining experience I've ever endured - far from it. But with the plethora of Thai choices (see later review) there is no reason for me to return to Sri Thai.", "author": "Timothy M."}

We then had the pumpkin curry (w/ tofu) and pad thai (w/ chicken). The pumpkin curry was delicious - like the soup, all the ingredients tasted fresh and made to order; there were distinct textures and tastes in every bite (as opposed to a nasty mush).\n\nOn the other hand, the pad thai was pretty disappointing.

I was happily surprised to find their food delicious. Personally, I really enjoyed the chicken satay, the pad se ew and the samosas. And, their customer service is exceptional. Though they messed up one of my orders (I ordered a salad with no prawns and they delivered it with prawns), I called them and the lady who picked up the phone was very helpful. She offered to redeliver the salad or give us credit for the future. I asked her to contact Livingsocial and refund my credit card, which I realize was more complicated, but she did it anyways and I received my credit less than half an hour later. Good food, good service, 5 stars!!", "author": "Svetlana K."}

Been eating here for at least seven years.  Our standard favorites are the Pad Himapan Chicken or shrimp.  Tried this dish at other thai places and nobody makes it like them.  Everyone else just does a quick stir fry with cashews but this place batters the chicken/shrimp so they have a slightly crunchy texture.  Love it!   Sadly, over the years the portion sizes have gone down, but alas, nobody makes it like them!\n\nCan't go wrong with their pad thai, and the YUMMY samosas made with sweet potatos.  If I could only get their recipe!  My four year old loves the samosas.  When I'm sick I usually order their Wo Sen soup (its a clear broth with noodles, tofu, veggies)   \n\nMy husband has been addicted to their satay for years, but we stopped ordering it when we realized the grilled chicken entree was basically the same thing (not on a stick of course) but you get a larger portion for a little bit more money.  You just need to have some peanut sauce to go with it.\n\nExcellent fast service!", "author": "Regina V."}

I've seen this place sooo many times, but it doesn't look very attractive from the outside.  It looks a lot better on the inside.  It was actually quite full too.  Just a couple of empty tables - one of which we soon occupied.\n\nEverything was really quick.  I think we had the Pad Broccoli, Spicy Fried Snapper, and Pad Thai.  The broccoli was pretty average for a broccoli dish.  The snapper wasn't spicy at all, so it was actually pretty tasty.  And the Pad Thai was okay.  I was a little hesitant because it was very monocolor when it arrived.  Just very brown and bland looking.

Been here once before awhile back but can't remember what we had. This time we ordered:\n\nFresh Spring rolls- OK/good:  Light on the palate with a tamarind sauce that wasn't too sweet. Fresh veggies but all a bit bland. The sauce made it good.\n\nChicken Wings - Good! : These were slightly sweet with a kick from the chilli sauce. Not too spicy but I had a recovering sore throat and ate a few anyway because they were so good. Skin was still crisp, chicken was moist and fully cooked through and fried basil for garnish was yum.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice w/chicken - Good!: Rice was a bit mushy/soft but not in a gross way. Just not what I'm used to with fried rice. Big chunks of pineapple. Flavorful. My favorite dish of the night.\n\nPad Thai w/shrimp - OK: Noodles were a little lacking in flavor. Not enough spices and although it was great for my now damaged from chicken wings throat, it could have had a bit more of the sauce since it seemed a little dry.\n\nPad Se Ew w/beef - OK: I liked this better than the pad thai but again the noodles seemed to lack any flavor. The veggies were cooked perfectly, not overdone or too hard.\n\nI came with a friend who normally doesn't like Thai food because of all the spices so needless to say she loved everything I didn't. \n\nOverall: 3.5* if I could give them that. They tend to skimp on the meat with all dishes but service was good. They didn't come over too often to pester us but not so often that we'd stare at our water glasses hoping they'd magically refill. My fault for chugging it after the first chicken wing though. Portions are smaller than  what you'd get at most restaurants but at the same price. \n\nI'll come back again only because it's the only Thai place good enough within walking distance from my house and I dont each much anyway so the small portions might be less wasteful for me as I dont like taking leftovers home.", "author": "Lisa D."}

I must confess I haven't eaten in here but have mostly ordered out.  The delivery is fast and friendly.  The first year I discovered this place I was ordering very often.  I was rewarded come Christmas time with a tin of cookies and a Christmas card delivered with my order.\n\nI would highly recommend the following:  Appetizers:  Corn cake (delicious pancake made of corn kernels mixed in batter and then fried); and the deep fried boneless chicken wings stuffed with ground  shrimp, chicken breast, corn, carrot, mushroom, bamboo shoots and silver noodles.  (One word:  Addictive)\n\nFor your salad course I would recommend the papaya salad or the beef salad.  If you'd prefer soup instead, then I would go for the tom kha  with your choice of shrimp, chicken, or tofu.\n\nMain course I would recommend trying the grilled chicken or duck, which is served on a bed of veggies and rice or the grilled salmon.  If you'd prefer a curry, you can't go wrong with any of the curry selections as they have yellow, green, or red curry.  When ordering a curry I usually order the yellow curry chicken or the delicious pumpkin curry.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood then I would highly recommend you stop by the place for some really good Thai food.

I love Thai food... really.\nLast night my boyfriend and I went to Sri Thai and were impressed by the Green Curry, and disappointed by the Pad Thai. \nMy green curry was subtle with spice that didn't hit me off my seat but was gradual and warming with a sweet after taste. The eggplant in the curry was to die for, melt in your mouth and a thousand other food cliches all wrapped into one.\nHis Pad Thai was less than impressive. He is a strict vegetarian and was put off by the fishy smell that the meal was giving off. The taste was OK but nothing worth trying again. We decided to put some of my curry over it, which improved the dish immensely.\nThe Thai Ice Tea was very sweet, I think they use half-and-half... mmmm... tasty.\n\nOverall the service was very good, smiling waitress and reasonably quick service. Besides the amazing green curry what really pushed this restaurant into the 4 star category was the interior, the music and the location. \nThe interior was very nice, comfortable with enough space between you and the next couple to have good conversation. Wine and two glasses hand next to every table, and good music plays at a background loudness. \nThe location is great! I love the outer-sunset, and being only a block off of N line, 3 blocks from the beach and facing GG Park... lots of parking and easy to walk to is all you can ask for in the city.", "author": "Tre B."}

That sure ruined the night. But their food is still decent if not great. I won't let one bad experience ruin this place for me :)", "author": "Christina X."}

Too many mobile hobo camps taking up parking spots on Lincoln makes it rare to find a spot later in the evening after neighbors have come home from work, and have also parked. The curries are a little watered down. The meat you get with an entree is very skimpy especially considering they've significantly upped their prices a few years back. The chicken satay is dry, and tasteless. The soup is a little watered down, and also lacking meat. Fried bananas, and coconut ice cream are very good.

Food came in about 50 minutes (a little long, but I'm also pretty impatient). Pad Eggplant was delicious! I often get this at Thai places and it's super oily, so I made sure to request light oil. This one was not too oily, the tofu was lightly fried but not greasy, and the peppers and onions were nice and crisp. The Fresh Roll was good, but I would've liked more veggies in it.

The Pad Thai was a little mushy, but the pork that I ordered with it was good.  The curry was a bit watery, and the herbs were a bit over powering; the beef was a bit chewy, but it was all still edible.  Service was friendly enough and food came out in a timely matter.", "author": "Long H."}

Nestled in the outer sunset, my husband and I stumbled upon this place after walking home one Sunday afternoon because we had missed the bus. We saw this place and decided to give it a shot and we loved it! The prices are reasonable, the environment is quiet and peaceful and the food is great! I highly recommend it!", "author": "Marilyn W."}

I may not have been to a million Thai restaurants, but of the twenty or so I've patroned I've gone a lot and eaten the shit out of the menu.  In my honest opinion, Sri thai is the second best thai place I've ever eaten at (1 is Thai Tom's in Seattle).  The food here is so damn good I can't stop eating it.  The pumpkin is amazing as is the pad prik king and himapan and the pad se-ew and the spicy fried noodle and... Plus they deliver and the prices are fairly cheap.  Sure the pad thai may not be the best ever but then again, where is it ever the best ever.  Pad thai is often eaten, rarely perfected.  So Sri gets five stars", "author": "David V."}

All the standards, pad Thai, Tom Ka Gai, green papaya salad, and various curries are just as Thai food should be.  The kabocha squash with fresh plump prawns is especially good.  Sri Thai is often full.  The service is competent and gracious; the atmosphere is fine.", "author": "Laura C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-11", "description": "3.5 stars, really. This place is always packed for some bloody reason, so I am typically forced to call ahead for take-out. The food is really yummy, but I wouldn't say it's more yummy than other Thai places at which I've eaten, so I don't really get why people rave about it so much. If you're here, and it's packed, keep in mind there's also a place on Judah @ 46th about 2 blocks away that's just as tasty (no, I don't work for them). Sri Thai is good at having things fresh and hot, so if you're looking for consistent thai food, go here. Just plan to wait during regular dining hours for a table.", "author": "Kid F."}

They had these rice flour samosas filled with taro and yams that were yummy. The eggplant dish was succulent and cooked to perfection, not too oily. Their brown rice was mixed with some wild rice and cooked just right. The staff were so nice and good service. I can't say enough!", "author": "Mariko M."}

It had a rusty weathered looking sign. The person working at the motel I was staying at highly recommend this restaurant. I am a college student and I went with two other students. We ordered the sweet and sour chicken fried rice, fried duck and a spicy chicken disk with flat noodles. This is by far the best Thai food I have ever had. Nothing was too sweet or too spicy. My only complant would be the portion sizes could have been slightly larger. We went in around 4 pm and waited 10 minuties for the chef to arrive, it was worth the wait. I have been to San Francisco more times than I can count and that was one of the best meals i've had.", "author": "Aaron J."}

Rolled there with my roomates and have been back 4 times in the last 2 weeks. this place is awesome the food is great, service is good except sometime you have to wait a lil while for the bill wich sometimes can be annoying if you are in a rush, but aside from that everything is great. my roomate is vegan and they took care of him they knew how to change their dishes to fit his diet. great thai iced tea", "author": "lord v."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-20", "description": "This restaurant is solid overall. Good curries -- pumpkin is indeed a noteworthy dish, papaya salad (my favorite!) and this appetizer that essentially looks like a fried and breaded drumstick, only the chicken meat has been shredded and mixed with veggies and noodles into a wonderful melange of good-tasting yumminess. I like the place because it has low-key character, good service, abundant parking (it's the Sunset!) and best of all, good prices for the food you get.", "author": "Frida K."}

If you like spicy, get this, but you can also ask them to ease up on the spicy if it's burning up your mouth like it did mine! Other dishes were the pineapple fried rice, fried calamari, pumpkin curry, and garlic pork (forgot the Thai name) dish. They were all very delicious. The Thai Iced Tea was too sweet though. The prices are very decent with the majority of the menu priced under $10 per dish. All in all, a great place to dine.", "author": "Amelia G."}
