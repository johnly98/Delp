I have gone to Bunn Mi, pretty decent and Mai's good stand by as well and super friendly. Today I finally tried Little Vietnam (not sure why I took so long) and I have to say it was the best noodle bowl I have had. I had the 5 spice chicken and the chicken was mostly thigh, I think, and perfectly cooked. The pickled veggies were perfectly in proportion to the rest and with the smaller bowl I was not overwhelmed with noodles. \n\nThis is my new go to. The service was friendly and truly appreciated and I will be back as I can eat bun many times a week.\n\nThank you. It was a pleasure.", "author": "J A."}

For an appetizer, we got one of their ready made shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce. It was the best thing we ordered. \n\nA woman from the kitchen brought out the sandwiches and placed some napkins on the table for us. It looked like the perfect sandwich so I was ready to dig in! They were served hot and the rolls were toasty. Like a traditional Banh mi it included long thinly sliced carrots and cucumbers, but only a lone jalape\u00f1o.\n\nA few bites in, I noticed it was very dry. There was absolutely no mayo or p\u00e2t\u00e9!! I was very surprised and asked my boyfriend if he had anything in his. There was a tiny smidge. We needed some kind of sauce to finish our sandwiches and luckily there was a small amount of peanut sauce left from our spring rolls. My boyfriend let me know there was a change of ownership. Wish I could've tried a sandwich from the previous owner.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

To caveat, I only eat fish and veggie, so that's what I'll be reviewing here. \n\nOther banh mi spots in the city that have options that I can eat tend to be fish cake, tofu, or some sort of a shredded veggie situation, which isn't always a crowd pleaser. BUTTTT what I love about the fish option here is that it's a freshly breaded/fried lemongrass fish filet! REALLY great lemongrass flavor. Perfectly flakey fish. Yum. In previous visits, I've also come by for bun rieu aka crab noodles aka super delish. \n\nService is very basic bc it's mostly a to-go spot. There are a few seats inside and outside, but not really a sit-down restaurant by any means. Sandwiches are def on the pricier side, which bothers me a bit when you can get these sandwiches for half the price elsewhere. I'm usually pretty happy w the banh mis overall, but today, the bread was a bit on the stale-esque side.

I love that...it's typical to see Christmas decorations year-round at Asian eateries but it's nice that this place kept up with the seasons. The restaurant is small, but there is a decent amount of seating inside and outside. \n\nThe menu has a wide selection of Vietnamese food, including banh mi, spring rolls, rice dishes, and bun. I ordered a grilled chicken banh mi and my boyfriend ordered the lemongrass pork banh mi. I overheard quite a few people ordering the vegetarian spring rolls as well as the bun dishes. Sadly, the sandwich I had was definitely not the best banh mi. But still better than Lee's. My sandwich came with mayo instead of the typical butter that is in Viet sandwiches. There was also a bit too much cilantro and only one stick of cucumber. Also the baguette was just OK. The meat on the other hand, was fantastic!! If I were to go back I would probably try the bun since I know the meat will be good. \n\nOverall, this place is a bit pricey for Vietnamese food and the interior is a bit dirty.

It turned out to be very bland today (they tend to be pretty inconsistent with the way they make their bun rieu here). So I went up to ask for some shrimp paste. It took them a while to get that to me as I was standing there in front of the register waiting. After going back to my table I realized I needed more lemon as well so I went back inside to ask for one more slice of lemon. The owner/cashier told me abruptly that I can't keep asking for one thing after another rudely, and that completely threw me OFF to the point where I told him to forget it. \n \nIt's one thing where I'm intentionally being an annoying and inconsiderate customer asking like 3+ times for additional condiments but I wasn't. I simply didn't realize I needed more lemon until after. I'm a usual regular here at this place and I was astounded by how rude this person was to me today.

They have Banh Mi, spring rolls with different toppings: pork, chicken, cold cut, tofu,etc. They also offer a variety of noodle soups. I was craving for Bun Rieu, an original Northern noodle dish. Here they made it with a Southern flare: the toppings include pork ham as well as the shrimp paste ball which was absolutely delicious. The broth has a strong shrimp paste flavor, which instantaneously made me salivate. A good amount of tomato wedges were included. The tofu slices were very thin though. I prefer a thick piece of tofu that is juicy when biting into it. This was not the case. This is one of the reason I gave 4 stars. Also the amount of noodles were meager compared to the amount of topping. I ordered the small size as recommended by the dude at the register, but it was too little for me. I read other reviews about inconsistency with this particular noodle dish. Maybe I was there on their good day. Hope for the best in my future visits.", "author": "Thuy V."}

It's super fast and easy to order. Simple and clear menu, and delicious vermicelli bowls. \n\nI find many Vietnamese places tend to overcomplicate things. It's really what sets Vietnamese food apart from other Asian food, its simplicity is what makes it unique, healthy and delicious. There is a delicate balance one must strike. Herbs, check; carb, check; protein, check; sauce, double check. \n\nOften people underestimate the power of sauce usage in Vietnamese cuisine. It's vastly important and must be fully appreciated if you intend to fully appreciate Vietnamese food. \n\nWhat I like about this little cafe is that it delivers the V. bowls in a delicate balance with uncomplicated flavors, then their light sauce serves as a pour over, toss it all up, you get a noodle salad with freshly grill meats, veggies and herbs.\n\nLady behind the counter is your typical sassy second generation Vietnamese American. Fluent in both languages, gives you non-nonsense suggestions, and communicate clearly as to what each of the over the counter items are as you are having trouble to decide which item to order. \n\nWe both got our vermicelli bowls.

Seating maybe 10-12 people max, Little Vietnam is hard to spot from the sidewalk because it is off of busy Clement St. located a few doors down 6th avenue. The restaurant appears to be run by an old Asian couple, the wife takes orders and works the cash register, while the husband brings food out from the kitchen. \n\nEating in can be somewhat awkward because of how small the place is, but the food is very good! I had the beef pho which was delicious. Rich salty beef and bone broth, plenty of noodles, very thin slices of rare beef, along with the usual sides of hoisin, srirarcha, lime, beansprouts, jalape\u00f1os and mint leaves. The GF got the chicken pho which she enjoyed. We also split an order of the lemongrass spring rolls which were very good as well. The flavor was delicious but the bowls of pho were slightly smaller than the ones I am used to at other pho places I go to and priced the same. On the one hand this was a good thing as accordingly I could not over eat, and on the other hand I believe the prices are a tiny bit high relative to the proportions. \n\nThe \"restaurant\" is tiny! So small in fact I have a hard time understanding why they offer \"eat in\" options. They basically have bar stool sitting for 6 and 2 teeny tiny tables that could seat 3 small people each, the tables are the sort you'd see on an outdoor patio. Almost looked child sized. I am approximately 6'2 I had to sit at the bar because I could not physically fit my legs under the table when seated in the chair. \n\n\n+1 Star Good beef pho, broth very savory and flavorful, beef very rare\n\n+1 Star Good chicken pho and spring rolls. \n\n+1 Star Mostly reasonably priced (under 10$ for a bowl of pho) \n\n+1 Star A decent helping of local, family owned, SF charm\n\n-1 star for how ridiculously small and awkward dining in here is.

First off, the place is very small, a couple of tables for seating outside and like 5-10 very tight seats along the wall on the inside.\n\nPrice wise, I'd actually have to go $$ on this one.  It's fairly expensive for Vietnamese food.  A bowl of Bun Bo Hue or Pho will go around $8.80 - $9.30.  Banh Mi sandwiches are around $5.25 which is pretty steep considering these kinds of sandwiches are very simple.\n\nI had the Bun Bo Hue, which is a spicy beef noodle dish.  I've had this plenty of times and I was not impressed with this one.  It's tough to review this one, because I'm use to the broth having a strong flavor with a hint of spice.  This one was bland to be honest.  Also, I've always heard food in Vietnam tend to be on the bland side.  So may be this is very accurate and representative, not sure.  Either way this was just OK.\n\nMy GF had the garlic noodles which turned out to be OK too.  These garlic noodles were really dry...SUPER dry.  It's not oily like other garlic noodles.  Sad to say, but it was a little on the bland side as well.  We have pretty bland taste buds too - we don't like strong flavors and even to us, it's bland!\n\nThe imperial rolls were pretty good - typical and is what I expected.

I was worried when I saw the recent reviews because I hadn't been back in a few years and was wondering if the quality had gone down; UH, NO!  The last time I visited I had a delicious veggie banh mi for about $5. No complaints. This time, I took a serious risk and got vegetarian pho. As a vegetarian, I usually just order pho tai, get the steak rare on the side, throw it in my husband's bowl and pretend that the bowl of meat juice I'm drinking is the one cow that died of natural causes that year :( I do all this because I was tired of being served bowls of hot, composted, flavorless garbage filled with weird, unnecessary vegetables like broccoli (BROCCOLI IN PHO :O). But I wasn't disappointed this time. LVC didn't just give me trash juice with scraps floating in it. The broth was complex and coconuty, more like tom yum than just plain veggie broth.  The tofu was braised, not just mushy, uncooked cubes carelessly tossed in. And there were APPROPRIATE veggies, like bok choy, in the soup. And not just a whole damn bok choy bunch tossed in (yes, I have been served a bowl of pho with a whole head of still attached bok choy, like an asshole) but actually chopped bite-sized. I can, without equivocation, say that it was the best bowl of veggie pho I've ever had and it solidified for me that yes, despite my whole life's experience, veggie pho can be a thing.  For what it's worth for you animal murderers my husband said the meatballs in his pho were delicious and velvety as well and that he could taste their sweet tiny screams. My husband is an asshole.", "author": "Sasha G."}

So I started coming here instead and now I just go here. It really is a special place.\n\nThe man you order and pay with is the man you always order and pay with. A very neighborhood place where people of all types come in here to grab a roll or a sandwich - lots of take-out. The man is very nice to all the patrons, definitely a lot of regulars comes here and he talks like he is proud of his food. (But not boasting or anything - it's more endearing.)\n\nPeek inside the window where he shouts orders to in Vietnamese, and it's like you've got all of your surrogate Vietnamese grandmas and aunties back there cooking your food. I may not have a Vietnamese grandma, but today I do! She's asking me if I've eaten yet... and why haven't I?! So she plops down a giant bowl of Pho, and boy is it delicious!\n\nWith so many ....I'll call it... fusion... banh mi places popping up, you have to come to a place like this to get the real deal. To me, it's not a real banh mi, unless it's got strange meats on it with pate. They do them just the way I like it here.\n\nLike I said, I like Cafe Bunn Mi - Their pho is good, but their \"bunn mi's\" are definitely the fusion variety. If you'd like to try the real deal walk a block down to Little Vietnam Cafe and give your surrogate Vietnamese grandma-ma a visit.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

Some counter seating is available inside and some small tables outside.\n\nWe came in on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm to pick up banh mi for dinner that night. There was no line at the time, but a few people either eating outside or waiting for their to-go order. I opted to try the Five Spiced Chicken Banh Mi ($4.15, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/little-vietnam-cafe-san-francisco?select=Fe4sCZTBV11SaX3Cmqkz7Q#Fe4sCZTBV11SaX3Cmqkz7Q) which was good, but the chicken wasn't my favorite. However, I loved their mayo, and the pickled vegetables were also really good. The baguette was also solid. I tried a bite of my friend's grilled pork, which I liked better and would opt for that one next time. The people here are really nice, and they make your sandwich quickly (took 5-10 minutes), so I will definitely be back for more sandwiches in the future!

The spicy beef soup wasnt very spicy, and didn't have any of the big chunks of tendon etc that I'm used to in bun bo hue.  The combo soup was relatively bland, not much there.  The beef rice plate we got was also very bland, and too fatty.  I don't usually mind fat, but when there is lots of fat and still no flavor, es no bueno.\n\nJust so I could have a taste of everything, I ordered a couple sandwiches to go.

While they're famous for Five Spiced Chicken Banh Mi (which honestly may be the best in the city), the lemongrass pork never has disappointed me with its delecate interplay of well-heeled citrus notes and slightly charred exterior. Neither one of these options are overly salty, and the ratio of meat to veggies is absolutely perfect.\n\nIf your feeling spendy, order your Banh Mi with \"Peter's Special\". Despite sounding like an act you would find in the pages of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", the extra $1.25 will get an over-easy egg and a generous dose of \"special sauce\" added to your lunch. The rich flavor of the cholesterol-endowed egg helps immensely to unify the textures and flavors of the sandwich, while the fish-sauce and garlic based jus seeps into the bread, imparting every bite with a fantastic marriage of flavors not to be found anywhere else in the City.\n\nOn the non-sandwich side of things, their Bun Rieu ($8.00)--featuring generous servings of crab, egg and tomato--is the Richmond's ultimate comfort food. Served piping hot and with a side of vermicelli noodles, the soup is extraordinarily filling, and an absolutely delightful panacea against the cold and foggy nights pervasive in the outside lands.\n\nService in this family-run restaurant is superb, with sandwiches and soup coming out quickly. Everyone is exceptionally friendly, and the owner (who works the counter) doesn't forget a face.\n\nFive Stars: Excellent Sandwiches, excellent Bun Rieu, and excellent service makes this hole-in-the-wall one of my favorite places to grab a lunch on the go.\n\nExtras:\n\n-Outdoor tables available.

In my opinion, if you made that stupid mistake then you should not ask a customer to pay you back for that mistake. \n\nA similar situation happened another time I was here to a guy who ordered extra carrots in his sandwich and was charged $6.50 total for his order, the woman behind the counter forgot to give him back his $.50 change in the midst of a lunch rush and after handing him his change and sandwich, told him that she forgot to charge him an extra $.50 for the carrots! \n\nOther than that, great place, great sandwiches. Oh yeah, don't forget that there are STAMP CARDS! BUY 10 GET 1 FREE! The stamp card is on the back of their business cards, they do not advertise or offer their stamp system, so be on the lookout to get one yourself.", "author": "Kawai N."}

Out for a nice slow jaunt on a fine day?\" A wise old man once said, \"You can tell everything about a place, by the demeanor and attitude of the roaches that reside there. If they are darting and hurried, then they are uncomfortable and always under pressure and attack. Grab and run. If on the other hand, they are slow and casual and appear accustomed and comfortable, not fearful, then that means that they are long term and permanent dwellers, familiar and comfortable with their surroundings, as they eat unobstructed and unbothered and grow and prosper with the establishment.\" Wise words from a wise old man? Nah, no one old or wise said this, only me, yeah old but def not yet wise, haha. So, sitting at the counter window seat, preparing to take my first bite of the chicken sandwich i ordered, I suddenly paused, as I studied the demeanor and attitude of the large roach that slowly and casually strolled down the counter and stopped in front of me and lazily lifted its head to stare at me, I felt almost as if he was greeting me, and letting me know that from here on in, we would be sharing this counter. Me very temporarily, him long term. He was home, I was gone. Oh welps, I had suddenly lost my appetite anyway, and plus, the \"five spice\" chic sand was prolly the worst version of this Viet mainstay that I had ever tasted. And hella expensive too! ($6? for a mediocre version of an excellent $3.50 sand? Wth?) It was tasteless anyway. More like \"no spice\". I bid farewell to my slimy shimmering friend, as he stood there staring at the visitor that suddenly abandoned his living room, leaving him alone. \"Stupid humans\" he prolly thought. \"Always comin and goin. Where the h--l are they always so busily off to? Why are they always in such a hurry? Leaving without breaking bread together, how rude! He left before we could both sit down and eat together. \" I felt remorse at abandoning him suddenly, but as I turned to leave and head to the 38 Geary and the TL and Saigon, to try again, and I accidentally glanced in the kitchen, and seeing dirty plates piled high, unwashed, in the back of the dark kitchen, I left comforted, knowing that my new found slimy, shiny friend had many other similar friends, and a large extended family to keep him company and to give him permanent, daily, constant solace. Because as that same old wise man once said, \"For every one you see, there are 30 you do not.\" No, this time seriously, he did say that.

From the outside, you can see through their cute windows to find their small seating area, but the interior was not much bigger as the menu with pictures were posted behind the counter. Next to the register was a colorful array of packaged spring rolls that were nicely positioned  for easy pickup. \n\nI had a hard time ordering but eventually settled for their warm lemongrass pork sandwich ($4). Unlike any of my other banh mi ventures, their French baguette was not flaky or tough but it was more like a soft roll that was thick and moist with great texture. It was by far the best bread I've tasted on a banh mi and it was filled with generous portions of thick, tenderized grilled pork, jalapenos, cilantro, and pickled carrots and turnips. This banh mi was so good and satisfying it led me to become curious about the rest of the menu that included pho and vermicelli. I was able to convince my yelp buddy David N. to share an order of fresh shrimp roll ($3) which came with two humongous pieces that disappeared faster than we could anticipate. I thought the dipping hoisin could be better or instead be replaced with fish sauce but I can't really complain when it was wrapped tightly and richly bolstered with large shrimps and loads of greens and rice vermicelli. I love these goi guon!\n\nAs a hole in the wall, this place serves up some badass sandwiches. The ambiance was modest and laid back, and service was accessible but brief as the server tends to hang out in the kitchen and only to emerge when necessary. 4.5 stars for great value and for the tandem of two supersized torpedoes that were loaded with flavor.

I started getting pretty dang hungry and I was in slightly unfamiliar territory near the Warfield. \n\nDum-ta-da-dum! Yelp to the rescue. I checked out a few reviews from fellow yelpites (yelpers? yelpies?) and opted for giving the Little Vietnam Cafe a shot solely based on Lauren S's note that the food was so good she might be selling her body outside of the cafe to eat there. Good food plus the chance of meeting the infamous yelper equaled me walking 6 blocks to get my bahn mi on.\n\nSo I totally dug the fact that this place had 'Authentic Vietnamese' on the awning but it looks like a trendy little deli. Really it was not what I was expecting when going to any Asian styled eatery. But different is good. The place was clean and it was easy to get what I wanted and go. To be safe I grabbed a pork banh mi and a spicy chicken. Not knowing how long I was going to be out doubling up seemed like a good idea; and if the food was as good as they say I might just pig out on the second one anyway.\n\nThe pork sammy was  delicious! Not at all what I would have expected. For whatever reason, it felt so much like a deli, my taste buds assumed it would just be a normal pork sammy. Two thumbs up for the bahn mi!

I signed up as a \"yelper\" the day I read about Yelp in the Chronicle the year they debuted. \n\nThe thrill of seeing my opinions about random SF eateries was titilating. I even got a few compliments. Which happened to be my mom, but still, it felt awesome. \n\nAnd then, like everything else, it became so goddamn hip. Fucking idiots with smiley icon faces as their lone review started cropping up. Fucking politics of the \"yelp-way\" became a matter of contention. Threads about profile pictures, or celebs or orther non-important issues were seemingly becoming de rigueur. Lastly, my favorite hole in the wall spots now were donning those obnoxious red  \"People on Yelp love me\" stickers.  Now numbnuts from New Jersey were trickling into Cordon Bleu. \n\nBut here I was today, on my way to Green Apple Books in attempts to make some cash and off load some old books. Last time I was in that part of the hood, I happened upon a hole in the wall Pho joint. Alas, my beef tendon pho was severly lacking in freshness and tastiness. So I thought I'd consult the old standby (and yes, their admittedly awesome \"things nearby\" option) for some reputable Vietnamese restaurants/delis.  \n\nLittle Vietnam Cafe seemed to be loved by most Yelpers, so I took note of the address and was on my merry way. \n\nSo it was good. I am not here to bag on the place, but it was just so fucking Americanized and over-yelped. Every single customer in there was white. NOt the best start. The group in front of me was a foursome of ladies who obviously were dragged there by their Frisco girlfriend, the one who had pink streaks in her hair in high school, the one who left all of her friends in randomtown Ohio to escape to the Wild West. Now here they were, all timid, meekly all asking for a chicken sandwich, and -gasp- of course no jalapenos!  I kind of was embarassed as every other customer there I witnessed made a substitution like it was fucking Applebees!\n\nOh well. People are weird. I've worked in restaurants many years, I am accustomed to the odd requests of something the chef created because, ya know, s/he's the chef and that is her/his art.  But good luck doing that at Saigon Sandwiches!\n\nI digress. Back to the review (see! It's happening to me too! I want to feel vindicated by writing a long-ass review!). So my spicy pork banh mi was like a Mc Donald's version of the classic French-Vietnamese sandwich. The bread was good. Too good. Needed to be harder, like only a slightly stale piece of French bread can only offer. And the good stuff, the stuff that makes banh mi's so damn good, like the cilantro and the jalapeno, were pretty much nonexistent. I don't mind eating cilantro stems, in fact, I crave them in my banh mi's!\n\nI bet they weren't like that pre-Yelp days. I bet I would have walked by it a few times deciding if I wanted to try it or not. I bet there wasn't  a large sandwich board describing offerred items. I bet I would have been ignored upon entering.  I bet it would have cost me $3.50. And, surely, I bet it was a damn good, rustic, and authentic banh mi.", "author": "Jane I."}

Yikes.  \n\nI'm going to continue my journey to find a Pho place around this area that takes the cake.  \n\nTruth be told, if there were no other Pho places even remotely nearby, I'd probably justify coming here for their Pho.  Like I said, it isn't BAD, per se, it's just not as good as some of their local (3 blocks away!) competitors.  \n\n2.745396 Stars for their efforts... even though they messed up on my order!", "author": "Johnson N."}

This is the bahn mi bread I expect- super light but with a crispy outside that just has to leave crumbs all over your shirt with every bite. This sucker was loaded with carrots and cilantro, sweet mayo dressing, a few jalapenos and deliciously thin chunks of tofu. The owner was very friendly and seemed to know his frequent customers.

Prices were standardly cheap.\nI'm not a picky eater, especially when it comes to pho. I understand that the perfect balance is hard to strike for a bowl of pho, especially for pho ga (chicken), which is often bland compared to the beef. This is my first time eating here, so it is very possible that the restaurant was just \"having a bad day\" or my bowl was the \"1 in a 100 miss\". In any case, here's the breakdown: the broth was the blandest I've ever had. Period. The absence of taste actually grossed me out. The noodles were okay, the texture was a little off but it wasn't what made the soup bad. The chicken also had absolutely no flavor and some pieces were undercooked. Overall, one of my least satisfying bowls of pho. \nConsidering the other reviews of this place, my advice would be to stick to the sandwiches.", "author": "Yana N."}

I'd be back to try it again to make sure.\n\nThe flavors were all there...it was just the consistency of the chicken was a bit tough and thin, the bread not toasty enough (again it could be because I ate the sandie later rather than right away), and one half of the sandwich had a great dollop of mayo which I don't like in my bahn mis.\n\nI need to research if mayo is usually used in bahn mis because I've had it with and without.  I'm not a huge mayo fan and I actually think it detracts from the flavors that make a bahn mi so delish.\n\nBut again the flavors were good (when the mayo didn't overwhelm): the saltiness of the chicken mixed with the nicely sweet pickled veggies, burst of cilantro, the crunch of the cucumber matched with the hint of heat from the jalapeno all worked.\n\nAnd at $4 a sandwich, not bad...not bad at all.

A sandwich with carrots? Get the hell outta here with that. Clearly you don't know me and we shouldn't be friends, because I fuggin' hate carrots. Except I love them on bahn mi and I am on the verge of selling my body outside of this cafe just so I can eat these sandwiches everyday. Chill out guys I'm only going to have to do it like once a week because these things are like $4 a pop. Actually, if I'm going to whore myself out, I'm going to do it for Bun Mee because 1. it's closer to my house 2. it's slightly better and 3. they have authentic Vietnamese sweet potato fries with the authentic Vietnamese spicy mayonaise that I like. \n\nI went here with some fellow good looking Yelpers after a walk around Land's End, during which we encountered this cute Australian chick who was looking for Baker Beach because apparently China Beach wasn't g-d good enough for her (maybe she wanted to see some franks and beans?). My friend Peebs, who is very sweet and would never make fun of me, asked if she was from England and I followed up with: \"So, are you here by yourself?\" BECAUSE I AM A CREEP LIKE THAT and while I totally didn't suggest she come to a party in my basement, I knew there was no recovering from my attempt at being polite to foreigners so I kept my damn mouth shut from then on. \n\nThe point of me telling you that story is that SHIT GOT WEIRDER with strangers at Little Vietnam Cafe. Peebs got some kind of rice noodle dish that had some kind of fried roll in it that looked hella good. So good in fact, that not just one old Asian lady stopped to comment about it, but two old Asian ladies at two separate times stopped to comment about it. After the first one, Peebs was already on the verge of strangling the next person that came up to her because naturally she wanted to eat her lunch in peace. The second lady came over, hovered over Peebs while commenting on each individual ingredient, as steam slowly started shooting out of Peebs' ears and I was sitting next to her laughing my ass off. \"Oh, rice noodles are good for you...oh and pepper! Pepper keeps your body warm...Looks soooo good!\" I think that old lady wanted a bite, and was seriously standing there until Peebs would give her one, except Peebs didn't because THAT IS WEIRD, LADY.", "author": "Joe T."}

I ordered the lemongrass grilled pork banh mi and an iced coffee to go.  I thought the portion size was pretty small for the price you pay.  The sandwich had an uneven distribution of meat (a large proportion of which was fatty/gristly), pickled carrots/radish, jalapenos (not very spicy at all!) and cilantro.  The bread lacked the crunchy/flaky crust I've come to associate with banh mi baguettes, and was chewy.  All these criticisms aside, the flavors were harmonious, and what I expected when I ordered the sammich.  The iced coffee was SO anemic.  Two to three sips later, I was hitting the dregs.

I, who abhor walking anywhere that the muni goes (because I bought a pass and it expires soon, and I want to get the most use out of it), walked the good 25 mins to this location.  Luckily it was all downhill after we got over the lone mountain.  And Lou made fun of me the whole time, wheezing and panting.

Plus, it yanked some hairs off my BF's body when he unromantically rolled on to my arm in the middle of the night.

But, the silver lining is, I get to shop or eat around the Richmond dist.  After 2 long hours in the dental chair, a growling stomach and sore tush, I hightailed out of the dental office to go get me some grub  even 'tho one side of my lower jaw was all numb and I was barely coherent when I spoke.

I'm on Clement St.  Even if the food was drooling down one side of my face, I was gonna eat.  After a little shopping, I turned the corner and decided to give this place a try.  For $3, I got a fancy pork Banh Mi.  I'd have to agree with Lolia \"Smurf/Froyo Girl\".  There was alot of cilantro, and doesn't hold a light to the sandwiches at Saigon Sandwiches or Irving St. Deli.  The bread was dry and harder than I liked, a layer of mayo, lots of carrot slivers, slices of jalapeno pepper, turnip and 3 small round thin slices of pork.  \n\nThe Banh Mi looked large and when I got home (hoping for resolution of the numbness), I took a bite and found the taste rather bland, even thru my paralyzed jaws.  I also picked up their 5 spiced chicken lunch tray for $5.  Slivers of dry BBQ chicken over thin rice noodles, served w/a sm salad and one chewy Vietnamese fried egg roll and a cup of sweet dipping sauce.  This was better than the sandwich.  \n\nI wouldn't really call this a cafe.  I remembered it used to be a take-out dim sum shop years ago and the space is cramp with a couple of 2 person tables if you must eat there.  For Banh Mi, Saigon Sandwiches is still tops for me.

We yelped a couple of places and for some reason they were closed on this Tuesday evening, and I'm glad they were or I wouldn't have ever discovered this little gem. Sure with their positive reviews I knew it wouldn't suck but I'm glad they lived up to the hype. I satisfied my Pho craving with their Vegetarian Pho...delicious - fresh veggies, great broth...yummy. We also ordered their Crispy Vegetarian Rolls (another delish dish) and their Garlic Noodles (OMGosh - not very gluten friendly, but for those days you need some comfort food...this will do it.) The staff was friendly and very attentive. They only have 1 2-top table inside with 5-6 counter seats and 3 2-top seats outside, so if you want to eat here, get here before 6 (when they close) and maybe don't go at your typical lunch hour!

So after hearing over and over about these Vietnamese sandwiches, tooted as the best bang for your buck in terms of cheap eats ($4 here), I recently found myself biting into my first. I obviously have no real reference point for other Banh mi in the city but I do like to think that I have quite the repertoire for tasty food references and this place definitely has made the cut. So to all you Banh mi connoisseurs, you're going to have to bare with this \"rookie\" assessment til I get to the legendary Saigon sandwich... \n\nI have to go and recommend the lemongrass roasted pork sandwich. The bread, tightly holding together the pork and veggies, was a good balance of crunch on the outside with a soft fluffy texture right before you hit the inner fixings of the Banh mi. The meat came in a good portion with a lasting flame roasted flavor that instantly gave me flashbacks to many a happy, meat-filled barbeque. And with a big ole portion of cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, cucumber, and carrots, I found a good bit of crunch to contrast the tenderness of the meat. And well I just happen to be a big fan of cilantro and anything with a high spice level! But the one thing that did put me off was the sauce. It definitely didn't stop me from eating the sandwich but not being a fan of mayo I would have definitely enjoyed a more easy application. So beware mayo-phobes, but otherwise definitely recommended! If not for the food then just for the friendly neighborhood chat with the unusually nice staff!\n\nAs for the rest of the menu, it doesn't seem too extensive but you'll probably find what you need. The spring rolls were big and filling, with no great surprise but overall a quality I'd come back to. And I can't say much for the pho but I'm pretty biased living around the corner from the tried and true inner richmond staple, pho clement. But if their sandwiches are any reflection of the rest of their menu ... I'll definitely be back soon for some new ventures.", "author": "Dominique C."}

I tried the chicken sandwich and my partner in crime had the pork combo. We split a little plate of rice boodles and Imperial rolls. It was really good! Definitely coming back again.\n\nThis place is tiny. There are 6 folding chairs inside along the window where there is a slim marble counter acting as a table. The day I was there there were 3 patio tables outside as well. It ain't got ambiance. Take it to go, I say. Which is what we did. The old guy behind the counter was really nice. When I asked what fancy pork was, he gave me a slice to taste! That was shocking to me because Chinese peeps don't normally don't give samples. I'm just sayin'.\n\nDespite the look of the place and all the dry erase menu boards, they do have a decent menu for something this size.\n\n***4.5.08  I've also tried the pate banh mi and the chicken rice noodle soup.

The bread can also be nice and soft like a Phillie cheesesteak Amoroso roll or completely dry on the outside. Luckily I haven't run into both at the same time. I think this place is owned by the same people who run the Vietnam travel agency next door as I have walked into the cafe with nobody at the counter when all of a sudden somebody from next door runs in and takes my order. I like all there Grab n' Go items such as all the various fresh rolls and their lemongrass tofu. I will give the benefit of a doubt and give them four stars bcuz although the sandwiches aren't up to Saigon Sandwiches standards in the TL, they still are better Than Little Paris ( I still miss them and the friendly man behind the counter though).", "author": "Brian J."}

The meat was quite tasty, however the bread didn't quite hold everything together, and the sauce was just OK. It just doesn't match the perfectly toasted baguette that Saigon Sandwich uses (along with their tastier-than-ever sauce) that'll hold up even until the next day!  However, if the TL is too far from where you live (and you need to pick up a quick lunch on the way to work), then I'd say that Little Vietnam cafe is adequate.  I found a hair in my banh mi today (this is my second time getting a sandwich from there), so that kinda bummed me out.  But hey, it happens.  Hairnets should do the trick in the future.  I prob won't be trying another banh mi from here, personally, but I'll have to come back and try the soups.

Little Vietnam Cafe is a poor excuse for a Vietnamese restaurant.  Their sandwiches are utter disgraces to the Vietnamese cuisine.  The bread was soggy, not crispy as it should be.  There was not enough meat. It was poorly seasoned.  Because it was so soft, the sandwich fell apart before you could even bite into it.  I bought three sandwiches on my first and last visit.  Purchased the chicken, pork and combo.   I judge a sandwich shop by their combination sandwich. A true banh mi dac biet (combo) consists of slices of pork, pork skin, pate, and cha lua (a type of vietnamese sausage/meat).  Little Vietnam's cafe sandwich consists of regular cured American ham, a slice of cha lua, and american mayonnaise.  It was horrific!!!!  If you want an authentic sandwich, I strongly suggest another sandwich place.  Do not visit this shop!!!", "author": "Vivian T."}
