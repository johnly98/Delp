My boyfriend took me here since he always raves about thee La Trappe. And I must say, he was right once again. \n\nEverything in the menu sounded scrumptious, it was hard to pass up on several of my options. I went for their Beef Beer Stew with the side of Belgium Fries. The beef was so tender and melted in my mouth. Also, the gravy was so flavorful and rich. The Belgium Fries was amazing, seasoned to perfection - I'm getting hungry just writing this review.  My boyfriend ordered their Konkan and Marinere Mussels - both broths tasted amazing. \n\nOur waitress was very attentive and sweet, despite of the very loud noise and amount of people dining in since we decided to eat downstairs.\n\nWe will differently stop by again, this time for lunch.", "author": "Johanna M."}

They change the cheese that's stuffed in the croquettes daily, which I though was impressive for a gastrobar. Regardless, can't go wrong with fried cheese.\n\nBrussel sprouts were a tad bit over doused with a mayo, and weren't as crispy as I would have liked, but that's just me being a little picky since everything else was fantastic.\n\nIf I lived in this area, it would most certainly be my go-to local bar.", "author": "Allie L."}

I'd love to, but I can't, because I never got it. \n\nWe arrived around 8:15 PM, and it was immediately clear that the waitstaff wasn't having a good night. I heard a waiter apologize to two different groups about the service before he even took our drink order... which took over 30 minutes to appear and was incorrect when it arrived. As for the food, it looked good on the menu, but we weren't able to try it; at 9:15, almost an hour after we ordered, it still hadn't appeared despite several assurances that it would be right out. We finally gave up and left (politely), since we had a show to see. \n\nThe waiter was apologetic and didn't charge us for our drinks, blaming new staff and no-shows. On the way out, a manager type chased us down to apologize as well, and, strangely, told us that the waiter was lying to us - that the problems were all his fault. I don't know what he hoped to accomplish by telling us that; it certainly did not increase the likelihood that we'd come back.", "author": "Larry C."}

Both times they blamed being short staffed due to a no show. \n\nThe first time we were just dropping in quickly for a round before dinner elsewhere. We got overwhelmed by the menu and ordered a couple of the triples on draft and liked them. Server was a bit flustered for someone having to serve like 3 or 4 parties total, so it took a bit but overall experience was fine.\n\nThe next time we were super excited to dive into that beer book and try the mussels. It was pretty full this time, but we found a table, poured over the menu and couldn't wait to order that special bottle. After sitting there 15 minutes the table next to us (who was there first) got their chance to order. The server said he'd be right back for us and about 5 minutes later he was. We ordered, but he said it would take too long to get bottles and could we just order something off the draft list. A little disappointed, we did so. We put in our food order at the same time.\n\nWhen the food was delivered to the neighboring table they still hadn't gotten their beers. They struggled to flag the server down for quite some time. When they got him he said he didn't know, the bar was really backed up, and ran off again.\n\nAnother several minutes went by and they had no drinks, we didn't even have water, and had to leave for a show at Cobbs so we unfortunately had to cancel our order and eat there. \n\nI'm giving stars for the atmosphere of the downstairs which did remind me of some dark spots where I've drank in Belgium, and for the impressive beer list that I still hope to try.

Boy, was I wrong. Turns out there's far more space in the basement, which is a reasonably sized yet far more intimate space. And, most importantly, there's a tremendous beer selection, good food offerings, and good service at the bar.\n\nThere's a huge variety of beers here, whether domestic, Belgian, or global, many of which pair very well with both savory and spicy dishes on the menu. Some brews I've enjoyed include a Petrus Aged Red, a Verdi Imperial Stout from Birrificio del Ducato, and a Hitachino Nest XH. The servers were very knowledgeable about the beers, and it seemed a lot of the patrons were too. Moreover, there's a good food selection, whether burgers, bistro fare, moules in a variety of styles (mariniere, a la biere, Konkan, you name it), or Belgian specialties like stewed half rabbit, Ghentse chicken waterzooi (traditional Belgian chicken stew), or stoofvlees (traditional Flemish beef beer stew).\n\nSo if you love beer like I do, especially in a Belgian pub-inspired setting, La Trappe is a reasonably authentic place to get your booze and grub on.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Maybe that's why I haven't been all that motivated to come here until Jamie W. and i strolled by on the way back from the Marina one Saturday. We peeked through the window and didn't see anybody in the dining room. It wasn't until we walked in that we realized all the activity was downstairs in the basement where we saw a lot of chugging and guzzling underway.\n\nWe secured a table for two and noticed yes, they serve food, too. We knew we had to have the $8 Belgian Fries since we just assumed it was a house specialty. It came with our choice of two dipping sauces, so we tried the Roasted Garlic Mayo and the Belgian Mayo which had a tangier flavor from the white wine vinegar (photo: http://bit.ly/2fRjNSO). It definitely held us over as we waited for our appetizer. I ordered the $10 Vegetable Tart for us, a nice surprise with slices of zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, and tomato with herbs, lemon and melted goat cheese on a flatbread pastry shell (photo: http://bit.ly/2feJ3yO).\n\nThat was a much lighter treat than you would expect from an underground pub. For his entree, Jamie was a bit adventurous and had the $18 Ghentse Chicken Waterzooi, which looked like a creamy soup except it was centered around pieces of chicken, fennel, celery and onion. A Dutch specialty originating in Flanders, it was actually more of a stew with a soup base made of egg yolk, cream and thickened vegetable broth. The fries had yet another place for dipping beyond the double mayos (photo: http://bit.ly/2fvmMfq).\n\nI went all traditional and ordered the classic $16 Mussels Mariniere bathing in white wine and butter filled with thyme, onions, shallots, garlic and parsley (photo: http://bit.ly/2esTmxw). This is indeed where they excelled as the mussels were fresh and succulent, full of the brothy flavor I was expecting. It would have been a shame if we didn't try any of their beers, so Jamie had an 48 pint of a local brew called Defenestration, a nice, golden beer (photo: http://bit.ly/2fpPIXp). Not being a major beer drinker, I just had an $8 bottle of Hank's Gourmet Diet Root Beer to wet my whistle (photo: http://bit.ly/2fpQFyT). \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...unique Belgian specialties served here and there's the beer, too\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...dark underground spot enlivened by the beer drinkers, a bit loud with the tables a bit too close together\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and helpful in explaining the dishes\nTOTAL - 4 stars...it it's Tuesday, it must be Belgium...or it could be Saturday, too", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-26", "description": "The vibe and ambiance of La Trappe have changed a lot since my first time there in 2012. Sometimes it's a hit, and sometimes it's a total miss. Given how many different experiences we've had here, it's a bit hard to write this review so I'll break it down the best that I can.\n\n*Ambiance: the restaurant itself is pretty unassuming. When you walk by, the top dining area is usually empty, but if you head downstairs, you find yourself in a grotto-like space where the Belgian beer flows and people get rowdy. At some point a few years ago, they started playing house/techno music downstairs and we stopped going. The vibe is definitely less party-party now, but it hasn't really regained the charm that it had back in the day (or maybe my mind is playing tricks on me - I guess we'll never know). \n\n*Beer: they have a very extensive beer list that comes in the form of a book that is reminiscent of Harry Potter. The beers are categorized really well, and the server is usually really helpful when it comes to choosing what to drink. If you are a beer aficionado or have a very international palette, I highly recommend you come here for a drink. \n\n*Food: the food here is pretty damn good. Their main dishes are mussel or french fry based (try both if you can). The mussels and fries come in/with an array of sauces or dipping sauces respectively, and they also have a variety of traditional Belgian dishes. My two favorite items on the menu are the Boudin Blanc (white sausage with a creamy mustard sauce) and the Ghentse Chicken Waterzooi (chicken stew). It's a hearty, filling meal no matter what you order. \n\n*Service: four out of five times, the service is pretty bad. The downstairs area goes from empty to packed really quickly, and they never seem to have enough staff to handle the influx of customers. We've had forgotten orders and item mix-ups more than a few times, and the wait time for your order can be anywhere from 15 to 40 minutes. The servers usually seem frazzled and more often than not, dirty dishes and empty water glasses litter your table until you ask a passing staff member to clear and/or refill. \n\nLa Trappe has become a place that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to people, but would certainly end up at for a casual Friday evening meal. I would love to see this place get a dose of TLC from management in terms of getting consistent service and a warmer ambiance.", "author": "Regina L."}

The beer selection here is second to none for Belgian and sour beers from outside of the US.  The menu is a little overwhelming at first, it must be close to 100 pages, and has the weight of a text book.  Since many of the beers are uncommon to most they have great description of each beer and a table of contents.  The draft list is maybe 20 or so but all are pretty hard to find and most you just don't see anywhere else.  I could go on about the sours and belgians here but you get the idea.  I'm serious, places that have a selection like this just don't exist.  One of the bartenders told me the owner even cellars his own stuff for years at a time so they have good vintage stuff.  \n\nThere is a small seating area at street level.  If it's sunny it's worth it otherwise I prefer the cavern style basement.  The bar is down there too and it just has a cool underground vibe.  When in Belgium you eat Moules-frites (mussels and fries) so I had to get them and I was not disappointed.  They are served in the traditional black pot, and they offer 4 different broths and the mussels were perfectly cooked.  They also have 8 or so handmade dips including the traditional beligie-style mayo.

I brought my family to San Francisco for a long weekend, and when we wanted to find a place to have dinner, that was different, this was the place (my wife, two older teenagers).  \n\nFirst, you go downstairs, and it is cozy, a little dark but that is ok, part of the atmosphere.  Juan was great... he handed me the beer menu and I thought it was the manuscript to a movie, it was pretty thick... After talking with Juan, he made a recommendation of a Belgian Beer which hit the spot.  They have ginger ale or bottled root beer for the kids... the root beer was good, real good.  \n\nWe started with a meat plate, and then the entrees. We had a burger, spaghetti, rabbit stew, and Boudin Blanco (white sausage)... all of it was great...

I was not expecting this from the modest exterior, but OMG come in, especially on a cold, SF day, go down the stairs to the more \"taverny\" downstairs, and enjoy a true feast!\n\nService is amazing - the wait staff are beyond friendly and will go way out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.\n\nThe beers and wine selection is on point. The waiters all can guide you to the perfect beer/wine if you can describe what you're looking for. I wanted a dry, sour cider, and they got me to the perfect one for my meal. They're also happy to provide samples, so just ask!\n\nAnd now the food. Oh. My. God. \n-The Frites - you cannot go to a Belgian spot and not try the frites. They invented fries! These are crispy all around but not overcooked like some twice-fried fries can be. There's a plethora of sauces available, my favorites being wasabi mayo, chipotle ketchup, and the traditional belgian ketchup. I'd recommend getting one mayo-based and one ketchup-based sauce to try. For added kicks, mix them for a blush sauce!\n-The mussels - we ordered a large order for 6 people to snack and share, in the traditional Mariniere style (The classic preparation with shallots, garlic, celery, onions, wine and witbier). It was so good! The sauce seeped into the mussels and they tenderly burst with flavor. It's a lighter, white sauce and not too thick, perfect for dipping bread or fries into.\n-Steak Frittes - steak and fries, a classic. But this was so well done. The steak was cut into strips, making it a very share-able plate. It was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The fries were, as mentioned above, fry-perfection.\n-The grand finale, my favorite dish of the day: GHENTSE CHICKEN WATERZOOI, a traditional light Belgian Mary's organic chicken stew with cream, potatoes, carrots, onion, and celery. TRUST ME PLEASE, THIS IS INSANELY GOOD. I did not expect this to blow me away, but it was creamy, just sweet enough from the aromatics, hearty without being heavy, and had such a unique flavor. It was crazy crazy good. I would recommend this dish over and over and over, and will over it over and over and over.\n-Dessert was delicious and light. I forget the name (not helpful) but someone from my party said they could now die happy. I'm sure whatever you get here, you won't be disappointed!\n\nHighly recommended for a cool date night, a group outing, guys meet up, or anytime you just want good, homey food and drink!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

But my favorite part would have to be the fries - perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. You get to pick a couple sauces out of a wide selection and my favorite was the garlic mayo (you can never go wrong!). Pro tip: The sauce from the rabbit is also an awesome dipping sauce for the fries! They also have a wide selection of beers and are very nice about supplying small tastings before you make your final choice.

I'm from Reno, where there really is no last call unless its empty on a Monday and even then, some bars are always open. When you come to an empty place you get worried! We walk inside and its a small knit beautiful little \"cafe\" with an open kitchen, kinda neat!! But nobody is there, besides the cooks. I was thinking damn! My chance to get a beer in an awesome city before I had to catch the BART out of town, and I walked to an empty restaurant with no actual bar in sight. Ya know... when you're sitting at a regular table just ordering a restaurant beer? It's just not the bar and beer/gastropub experience I was looking for. But then I notice a sign, it says \"join us downstairs.\" Now, I'm like oh yes! As We walk onto this spiral staircase taking us underground, we are immediately met by someone downstairs, very friendly! He points us towards the bar, and it is moderately busy down here!! People are ordering food! Getting drinks! It was an awesome atmosphere. We sit at the bar, which is just such a cool little bar kept up near the underside of the spiral case, and the bartender was asking us about beers and explaining some other ones to us.

As a beer lover, please do come here because they have over 200 beer selection. Parking isn't that bad, but try to come early to ensure you get a table since place is small. They have an upstairs and downstairs but almost everyone likes to sit downstairs. Nothing wrong, but downstairs carry a better atmosphere. \n\nI wasn't as big of a beer lover as my boyfriend, so this was like candy-land for him. They had their own beer menu with a table of contents (it was that intense). It was really hard to choose, so we asked our server to recommend us one. He was super nice and knowledgeable. My first beer was strawberry flavored. It was so good I was hesitant to drink it that fast. I didn't really know want my boyfriend got, but according to him it was very good. \n\nFor food, we started with a dozen oysters, as usual. They were pretty small, but they packed such a taste! It was actually perfect for its size. We were excited for their rabbit stew. Supposedly the meat is very tender and tastes similar to chicken. A whole sectioned rabbit leg was presented along with mashed potatoes and some veggies. Our expectations was slightly skewed, expecting actual \"stew.\" Sadly, rabbit meat tasted like chicken we buy from Asian BBQ places, but just slightly better. Well, at least we can say we tried rabbit!\n\nRound 2 of beer, I ask my server to recommend me another one. Boyfriend orders a Japanese kind. We weren't full so we ordered two more appetizer dishes: curry mussels and croquette with shrimp and cheese. \n\nCroquette was a let down, too. Barely shrimp and too much cheese. The sriracha avoili was a bomba$$ dipping sauce. Curry mussels was another let down as well. Curry was great, but they added too much ginger which caused it to be pretty spicy. They give a hefty amount of mussels though. \n***Tip: Don't waste the sauce! Use their free bread to dip into it :)\n\nRound 3 of beer. I called it ends. Server surprised my boyfriend with his personal favorite IPA. I think SF may have won his heart over, finally.. \n\nSHOUTOUT to our server for his great personality, service and friendliness throughout our meal. He definitely made our experience nice. \n\nOverall, food was normal, didn't struck as anything special. I wouldn't come here for the food, but I would come here for their beer. I found it super cute how each beer had their own glass which sometimes came with cute cartoons. It's too bad their wine selection couldn't be as extensive as their beer though.

If you like the sweeter side of things try the Wild Strawberry Lambic - it was incredible (hence the 4 starts for this drink alone!). \n\nWe split the steak meal which came with two sides and large enough to share if you have an appetizer or salad as well. We opted for the harvest salad (I think) with the candied nuts. It was good with a light salad dressing and bread with Roquefort cheese spread (too heavy for me).\n\nThe ambiance in the basement is cozy with large wooden plank style tables and chess boards.

Wow. \n\nI came by with a close friend on a Friday night, after a full day of marathon boot shopping (for her). \n\nAt 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening, we were able to be sat immediately. *Cartwheels!  In fact, one of the things I liked the most about LT was that it was not uncomfortably crowded. We were able to enjoy our evening in peace, relatively speaking. \n\nWe sat downstairs, which definitely embraces an old school pub atmosphere. If I could picture what the inside of the shire looks like, this would be it. It's warm, dark, old and wooden. Nothing fancy. \n\nThe beer menu is frakking epic. I normally fear no beer, and certainly no beer menu, to be sure, but I must admit that with 400 imported beers and a beer menu exceeding 35 pages, I was a little flummoxed. But fear not, friends, your server knows what SHE'S doing (*throws another wrench into assumption that beer drinking is a man's sport). If you tell her what you normally like, she can walk you through it and make recommendations based on your tastes.\n\nWe started with a traditional lambic, moved on to a red, and finished with a very sweet lambic. We shared bottled import beers, which I strongly recommend because you can try more that way (and you drink less as well). With such an enormous beer list, you're going to want to try a few and figure out what you like (and don't like). Don't forget, practically everything is imported, so even the most seasoned American beer drinker might run into questions. Again, the staff knows what they're doing, so please ask. \n\nFood wise, we started with the ratatouille, which I was only lukewarm about ordering--but it turned out to be delicious!  It was flavorful, fresh and healthy. Then we shared the Boudin Blanc (3 white sausages in a mustard sauce with scalloped potatoes). The BB was a lot lighter than I expected.  It was so good--my companion was like, \"Please, make me stop eating this.\" So I took my plate and put it on top of the BB, and was about to signal our server to remove the plates when my friend removed my plate and continued eating. Well then! It was that good. \n\nWe were physically unable to do dessert. So full. \n\nFor three bottled import beers, ratatouille and BB, it was about $70, which isn't too bad for dinner in SF.

The upstairs has just a few tables but tends to be much quieter than the cavenous space downstairs.\n\nWe ordered a couple different styles of moules and frites (mussels for the non-french speakers).  I tried the typical white wine and garlic sauce and also tried the curry sauce - both were fantastic.  Frites were nice and airy and crispy- just as I would expect.  I enjoyed a framboise lambic beer- was surprised at the selection of lambic- several different peche, framboise, currant, gueze, etc.\n\nMy only disappointment was the Belgian waffle.  If you've ever tried an authentic Belgian waffle, you expect it to be very light and airy, with special sugar crystals baked right into the batter that are little bits of gooey sweetness when they're warm. Unfortunately, our \"belgian\" waffle was heavy, dense, made from whole wheat flour (which could be done successfully), had a slight bitter taste from the type of flour and lacked the sweet sugar crystals.  \n\nSo I would love to come back and try other menu items and hope that they can work on getting my beloved Belgian waffle done right!", "author": "Christine S."}

This was perfect including the Russian Hill drive as a SF introduction. Do not be confused by the small upstairs. Go downstairs to the main restaurant. The decor is dark and cosy and the crowd noisy. The place was crowded on a Friday night and they didn't take reservations. We arrived at 8 and didn't need to wait.\n\nThe food was epic. We had a beef stew which was like no other I have had. It turned out to have been cooked with gingerbread spread with mustard.  This made a unique and awesome taste. The chicken waterzooi was also quite good. The stew came with fries and a choice of two dipping sauces. We choose the red peppers based sauce which was excellent. I would rave even more but the fries were seasoned so tasty we forgot to dip them half the time. The portions were huge and though quite hungry we had a lunch worth of doggy bag left over.\n\nThere is an awe-inspiring list of beers and the waiter was able to match beer preferences with potential choices. I had a most delectable stout with chocolate and cherry undertones. My dinner companion doesn't drink. For her there were interesting imported sodas.\n\nThe dessert was good too.

Everyone who was working seemed to be rushing to get things done (whatever they were doing).\n\nI ordered the moules pastis (creamy baked mussels) with an Affligem blonde (Belgium ale) while my friend got the chicken videe (shredded organic chicken with cream in a puff pastry). \n\nThe mussels were delicious. I was very happy with my choice. The fennel sauce really added a nice depth of flavor to the entire dish. Without it, it would have been just okay. I wasn't particularly happy with the slice of bread they gave me since they placed it on my platter to make it look normal...but was burnt on the other side. \n\nThe beer was pretty good.

The service is terrible as the servers focus almost exclusively on the affluent, almost-entirely testosterone-laden tables of 12, loud, vulgar, raucous 25-35 year old male techies. \n\nLocal,  tourist and dating couples are shunted off to the corners of the downstairs beer cellar dining room and forced to listen to the techies swear profanities and whoop and yell extremely loud as though they are still in the fraternity house which they were surely never members of because as nerds they not only would not have been accepted into university Greek life, they would have known not to even rush. \n\nDon't worry. They're making up for lost time all across San Francisco, Emeryville, etc. making going out in public difficult for normal people - whom they disdain.\n\nBack to the service at La Trappe: On the last few visits whether we have dined downstairs or upstairs service has been terrible. Food orders are incorrect. Food arrives slowly as others are served ahead of us. Servers fawn over techies and look at the rest of us as though they wish we weren't here. \n\nMy last server seemed as though he shared in the general mysogyny, ageism (and perhaps even the homophobia/Lesbophobia) of the multiple large- tables of techies that night. \n\nWe (two Lesbian women in a couple who are long-term neighbors and  customers of La Trappe) were there on what was a special occasion for us, a cause to celebrate. La Trappe needs to fire some people or bring in a professional diversity trainer. The dinner was ruined for us by the server and his attitude (he treated us as though we should not even be there)  the unwillingness to control the vulgar, loud, disturbing behavior of techies, the disappointing food. \n\nWe were not the only other couple trying to have a quiet dinner down there that evening. There were at least four other tables like us, romantic or just tete-a-tete discussing life or business QUIETLY. These other restaurant \"guests\" all had that \"never again at this restaurant\" look on their faces. \n\nDid I mention that at a table for two or four downstairs it is nearly impossible to hear your companion(s) once the nightly tech crowd arrives? Its hard to even hear yourself think. The atmosphere which used to be quaintly \"Left Bank, beer-cellar continental\" is now darkly claustrophobic. I don't care how many beers, ales, etc. you have on your menu as thick as a novel if there's no pleasure in being there to imbibe.\n\nLet's discuss business models: Not a good idea to hitch your star so completely to the rise of the tech boom. San Francisco has seen this before. I predict that when the tech bust comes...and it will, it just may not be as big as the last time... THIS restaurant, so dependent on techies for business, will be OUT OF BUSINESS and FAST!!!", "author": "Scout F."}

The food while not mind blowing does an excellent job of satisfying appetite, and does taste excellent. I had mussles and frits paired with a leipziger gose. (Incredible btw). I also had their blue cheese burger, a little blander than I had hoped but still tasty AF. Where this place really shines is the service. Zack was our waiter twice. I was thoroughly impressed not one time, but both times! Zack, although being the only waiter on staff twice; one of those times being crazy because pliny the younger was on tap, has consistently exceeded his role as a waiter. He consistently goes to extra lengthes to keep me and my people happy. He is always smiling.

I can't tell you how amazing it is to have a waiter as perceptive as Zack. If you want outstanding service, incredible craft beer, and great food La Trappe is the place to go.

This is in part due to its newly-refurbished downstairs, which hides the fact that locals actually enjoy their fine food, beer, and even wine selection. In fact, the downstairs is so comfy, so full of tables with chess boards built-in, and so full of old brick and funky wall coverings -- I could spend an entire review just raving about the decor and ambiance. Let's be glad I'm not actually doing that, eh?\n\nWhile my partner and I are both not exactly beer aficionados, we both had to be impressed at the extensive menu, including some interesting-looking gluten-free Belgian triples and quads. That said, the wine list was up to the task, which is not something you normally get in a place geared towards beer.\n\nWe got the fried Brussels Sprouts for an appetizer, which came with a light tangy sauce, and were cooked right to that place in-between crunchy and not-so-much, with a nice crispy outer coating. My partner got the steak con frites, and was very pleased by both the perfect medium-rareness of the meat, as well as the fries and the various dipping sauces that came with them. She's not a big mayo fan, and their dipping sauces are a little mayo-heavy, so there's that as far as complaints go. \n\nI got the roasted rabbit with perhaps the most amazing mashed potatoes I have EVER had in my life. They were just a hair salty but not too much, creamy, but not overly so, and sat on top of the most basic but incredibly flavorful red wine reduction. I serious started using my fingers to get the last little bits of potato off the plate at the end. My rabbit was well-cooked (not overdone) and came with both half a rack and a full hind leg, which was actually a surprisingly filling portion.\n\nThe waitstaff was all incredibly friendly and helpful, and our waiter was very much an easy guy to have a laugh with. And when he made the small mistake of not bringing a steak knife? He immediately corrected the error and apologized within 2 minutes, which is more than enough service for me.\n\nIndeed, it is wabbit season. La Trappe, I'll be back for that triple... although I wish I had asked if you had your own chess pieces.\n\nOur one complaint? What the heck is up with that weird taxadermied cat photo, making the taxadermied cat look like he was kneading out some pizza dough? Seriously -- what the HECK?

I invited a few friends out to see our favorite comedian and planned to go to La Trappe for dinner prior to the show. We gave ourselves ample time (about an hour and a half) so we could eat, drink, and still have time to find good seats at the show. As much as I want to base my review on the beer and one appetizer, the one star is mostly based on the slow chef in the kitchen and the hostile manager that left such a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nWe sat down to eat, ordered a few beers, a few appetizers, and a few dinner plates to share for the six of us. The beers took 10 minutes to get, which can feel like a long time but it was a bit busy and understaffed... we let that slide. About 40 minutes goes by and one appetizer comes out... ONE. We wait another 10 and the second comes. When I say appetizers, I don't mean something extravagant or hard to prepare - one of our appetizers was a meat and cheese platter; is it that hard to put meat and cheese on a wooden block?? 20 more minutes pass for a total of 1 hour 20 minutes, and our last appetizers come with salads to our main plates. At this point we're running late to our show and we ask the waitress for the check and to cancel the rest of the food. \n\nWhat happens at this point, I've never had happen at any other restaurant and is the main reason for my one star. The manager or owner comes up to our table and asks what the problem was, looking very upset. We explain the situation, telling him that we're running late for a show. He gets irritated, clearly holding back his frustration, but puts the blame on us by saying \"Why didn't you inform your waitress?\" We plainly reply \"We didn't think it would take over an hour.\" He stomps away from our table into the kitchen. Cooking up a dish in a timely manner is one thing, but to lose your composure and blame the customer is UNACCEPTABLE. I do not plan on ever returning. We left the restaurant bewildered that anyone would treat their customers that way.\n\nBreakdown:\nBeer is Beer = Great = 4 stars\nService = Poor = 0 stars\nFood = Not Applicable\nTotal = 1 star", "author": "Jose H."}

The french fries, honestly, were off the chain, and the dipping sauces delicious.  I believe the spicy chipotle was my favorite.  \n\nMy only real complaint was it took close to an hour to receive our food once we ordered.

These little fabric bits I speak of were also in our water glasses. Deal breaker: my boyfriend's cutlery had dried mustard on it.\n\n2.

The waitress sneakily upsold my friend on the cheeseburger (\"eg. what type of cheese would you like with that?\" when cheese was an extra $1.)... not that $1 is an incredible amount or that he wouldn't have ordered cheese anyway, but I didn't appreciate this sneaky upsell. \n\n3. Bad food:  My boyfriend and friend got burgers (not done to temperature requested) and I got the hot dog. Burgers were bland, fries were limp and likely out of some Ore-Ida bag. Sausage was a sausage with some mustard at $10. I asked if they could make me the portobello sandwich, but not fry it. She said it's all \"preprepared\" so she couldn't swing it.

I'm not local, so a friend, who has been in SF for a couple years, told me this was one of the first places he found. This was my last night in SF, and I got to say, great place to finish the trip.\n\nSo when you walk in it looks like your normal cafe/sit down place. However, there's a spiral staircase that leads to where the good stuff is. It's a little dark down there, but your eyes will adjust. Tables, booths, old wood, a bar and zero flat screen tvs reside downstairs.\n\nLooking at their beer menu, it's massive. Asian karaoke song book massive. I recall trying to pronounce the names because the bartender jokingly said you can't point at the beer you want, you have to attempt to say the name. My first beer was a quadruple (unfortunately I can't recall the name because it was 6 words long), so it was a little sweet & raisiny tasting. I actually really enjoyed that one. My second beer was a St. Bernadus Abt 12. I remember this one because the monk on the label looked like he was really enjoying his beer (as was I).\n\nI really wanted to sneak one of the Belgian beer specific chalices out. It just a different feeling when you drink out of a Belgian beer glass. I would have drank my OJ out of it.\n\nThe only issue I had really was that it got pretty warm down in the basement. I know San Franciscans are sensitive to cold air, but a little AC would be great (how about an oscillating fan or two).", "author": "George Y."}

A few minutes later we are all talking and owner comes down stairs yelling at us for no reason. He himself knocks a few drinks over and blames us and then kicks us out. No wonder we weren't happy.

These people meant business when it comes to seafood. Since the dish came with fries, I get my pick of two condiments. I decided on the peanut sauce and wasabi mayo. I also tried Orin's roasted red bell pepper mayo; think that was my favorite. The fries had a lovely crispiness and mushy on the inside, just the way I like it.

I had the Peche Mel and the Duchess here. Both were delicious. If you like strong fruit flavored beers, the peche mel is the way to go. Please stop and smell it before your first sip. Its fragrance is absolutely delightful and totally fruity without being overly powerful. The duchess is a sour beer that pretty much tastes like black cherry champagne. I'm HOOKED. A glass of the beers will cost you $8.50-$9.50 on average. There are more expensive bottled beers available if you want to go all out. As an amateur of craft beers however, I'm well satisfied with the $8-$9 selections.\n\nThe ambiance is warm, cozy, and underground. One star off for being sat next to a huge portrait of Edith Piaf's stuffed dead cat. Its face is literally grotesque. It looked like it was rotting and molting all at once. Not exactly the most appetizing view, which is a shame because the food is so very appetizing.\n\nFor example, take the Belgian fries. You can choose from a variety of  dipping to accompany them. From roasted garlic mayo to dijon mustard or spicy ketchup, these fries are sure to delight the palette. I also had the Chicken Videe which was shredded chicken cooked in yummy cream sauce and baked in a flaky, puffed pastry. I was afraid it would taste like chicken pot pie (which I do not enjoy), but to my surprise it was really great! Not too salty and not too heavy (which summarizes how I feel about chicken pot pie). The Chicken Videe is served over a bed of greens, which creates a really nice balance.\n\nI will definitely come back to this place to try more beers and eat more delicious food!", "author": "Evonne L."}

Great place to hang out and catch up with friends if you get there early enough.  By the time we left there was quite the wait, so we made the right move in getting there a bit early.

I would imagine that we would eat at an Italian place, but he had other plans...\n\nThe downstairs was PACKED.  I mean packed. The bar top was filled and the booths and tables were filled with beer drinkers.  We somehow got the attention of a busser who put us on the wait list and also recommended beers for us.  We couldn't pronounce it for the life of us so he wrote them down for us to show the bartender.  Bartender wasn't too friendly, but I suspect it's because his bar was crowded and getting a bit out of control.  We got our drinks and sipped them and people-watched while we waited for a table to open up.  No more than 10 minutes is what it felt like when the Asian busser came to us and asked us if we wanted to sit upstairs.  \n\nHELL YEAH!\n\nWe sat upstairs literally, next to the door, so cold air came around us everytime the door opened.  Pretty wack, BUT we wanted to sit and it's not their fault it's cold, right?  Later on through the meal, the table next to us left and our kind server let us scoot over so we weren't' next to the door.  \n\nWe ordered a few small plates.  the mussels and frites with the garlic white-wine, sardines and a smoked salmon salad. \n\nThe mussels were the highlight of our dinner.  We just kept dipping our bread and fries into that gorgeous broth.  The mussels were ridiculously good-  and it didn't cost an arm and leg.  The sardines were on point too, grilled, served with lemon, fennel and a duo of herb sauces.  The smoked salmon arugula was great too-  served with a lemon vinaigrette, cherry tomatoes red onions and goat cheese. We also dipped our frites with the sauces they recommended.  Garlic mayo and spicy ketchup were good (We killed the garlic mayo first.  Duh)  I wanted to bring the mussels home, but for some odd reason, La Trappe doesn't allow guests to take home food?  Their excuse is because mussels go  bad.  Listen, I eat Chinese seafood all damn day, and I take that shiz home too.  It ain't bad, It's wasting!\n\nI think the best part of our meal, aside from the mussels, was the service.  Not the bartender, really but more so our server and busser.  Our server was gracious, on-point and always around to help us.  The dining room was small and he somehow managed to practically dance the ballet weaving in and out of the limited space he had to drop off food.  I always appreciate good service, as I once did a heavy amount of time at the restaurant.  \n\nHe told us he had to work St Patty's day, so we hooked him up extra, cause nothing's worse than working on a night where you should be enjoying beer and festivities, NOT serving obnoxious, singing drunkards.

In fact, I'll probably give this place one more try, and if the experience is as flawed as the last few visits, I'll just stop coming here:\n\n1) On THREE out of my 5 visits, the servers have been somewhat inept. This could be because they always seem new (management can't retain their employees?), and having an extensive beer menu and foreign names doesn't help anything, I'm sure.  That could explain why I was given an incorrect beer (which I didn't realize until tasting it)... but it DOESN'T account for the fact that two different waiters have spilled beer on us: the first time, they knocked a beer over on a nearby table, splashing everybody in the vicinity; the second time, they didn't seem to know how to pour the beer, and poured it way too steeply/directly, foaming up and overflowing the glass.\n\n2) Last time we were there, we had a show to hit (Beach Blanket Babylon) 2 hours later, so we were on a time crunch, but that should have been plenty of time. We arrived early, and the place was pretty empty, so we were promptly seated and served. We made sure to order our food first (mussels, rabbit, and \"Wallonian hot dog\") to make sure it got started while we perused the beer menu.\nThen our beers arrived, but it seemed to be taking a heck of a long time for the food... then I started looking around, and noticed: about 10 PEOPLE that had come in AFTER us were being served their meals (they weren't even in the restaurant when we arrived.)  We had difficulty flagging down the waiter, but when we did, we pointed out that we had ordered food 40 minutes earlier, and he said he would check on it... he brought 2 of the dishes but said \"Sorry, the mussels are going to be a few minutes more... there was a bit of a backup.\"  If there was a backup, shouldn't our order have been AHEAD of the 6 people next to us who weren't even there when we placed our order? And it can't be what I ordered... 3 of them got their orders of mussels, while I had to wait for mine.  Basically, this place seems like they simply do not have a good system.  It's like our order was somehow lost or forgotten entirely...\n\n3) On a previous visit, I was overcharged for a beer, and the manager wasn't exactly friendly about it. I was charged $2 more than the price listed on the menu, and when I brought this up with the waitress, she got someone (manager? owner? It was a guy with a dark beard) to come talk to us... he seemed very agitated and said \"The price printed on the menu is wrong, but since that is what is on there, we will adjust the price for you this time.\" \n\nLook, it's not my fault you don't update your menus, or print the wrong price on it, or whatever happened (or maybe try to fleece people when they are inebriated and hope they don't catch it??)  There's nothing unreasonable about me expecting to pay the price that is right there in black-and-white... in fact, if it had been more expensive, I wouldn't have ordered it!\n\n\nOther than the service, the place is pretty cool -- I like the atmosphere, the beers are good (but sometimes overpriced), some of the dishes are excellent -- particularly the mussels and the rabbit dish (the french fries aren't anything special and are way too expensive for what they are, which is a shame.) \n\nBut the total lack of friendliness and professionalism is starting to leave a sour taste in my mouth (and it isn't the gueuze)...", "author": "Matthew G."}

Because I would imagine if a restaurant owner would like to protect himself from the wrath of people who don't consume bacon, he'd include those 5 letters on his menu. \n\nA bit of backstory. We decide on La Trappe for a lovely meal, pre Cobbs Comedy Club. We've done it before and had a great experience. We're feeling a bit adventurous so we order a rabbit. Out it comes smelling great and looking delicious. I take a bite and it oozes flavor. Seriously it melted in my mouth. I exclaimed, which I never do out loud, \"The onions are so goood\". I take a few more bites of the rabbit, sauce, potatoes and green beans. My friend then discovers why the onions were so good, huge pieces of bacon! But I don't taste any bacon! That's because I've never had it! \n\nFast forward 7 minutes. We ask our lovely waitress if there's bacon in our rabbit and she says no. She asks the manager, who we'll call A$$hole, in front of us and he says \"yes! Prunes and bacon\". They both take off to go check out the menu. He didn't even know his own menu and didn't bother to return. Oh and A$$hole wasn't busy at all except at being the resident a$$hole.\n\nFast forward 3 more minutes after a nice apology from our waitress and after we pay full price for a half consumed bacon rabbit, we walk upstairs and my friend seeks out A$$hole. She politely as all hell mentions that maybe they should say bacon in the menu. A$$hole doesn't say a word and looks at her as creepily as possible and keeps nodding condescendingly and then says \"I can change the menus\". Nothing else. No apology and no offer to comp our bacon infused rabbit. A$$hole's obviously not given a sh!t about his customers before us. Dude was an expert in making us feel like idiots for politely mentioning bacon should be included in the description of a dish. A simple sorry would've resulted in a Yelp positive review. He has no intentions in changing those menus.\n\nCliff notes. We order rabbit. We get bacon rabbit. We stop eating bacon rabbit. We mention they should describe it as a bacon rabbit and not just rabbit. We get the death stare of all time for attempting to help future customers. \n\nCliff cliff notes. Avoid A$$hole if possible. Everything else about La Trappe is great.", "author": "Sameem S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-11", "description": "I've been to Le Trappe a handful of times over the past year since I live in the neighborhood.  I've never been overly impressed or disappointed so never wrote a review.  (In fact I haven't wrote a review on here in a long time apparently) But I witnessed something at La Trappe the other night that was downright disturbing, so here I am.\n\nA customer seated near me at the bar ordered something and was asked his name on the tab.  Apparently the customer was annoyed having to give his name each time he ordered (he said 5 times that night)  I can see this being kind of annoying since the bar only seats about 8-10 people and he's seated right at the bar and it was loud in there.  Having to shout out your last name every time you order a beer could get old.  I mean, even at chain places they put your tab in front of you at the bar in a cup.  Anyway,  the customer gave his name again, and said,  \"you guys need a better system\".  A pretty fair statement perhaps.  Well, NOT TO THIS BARTENDER!  You would have thought this customer just insulted this bartender's mom with the insanely crazy way he reacted.\n\nThe bartender jumped down the guy's throat, (forgot what he said exactly but it was nasty) and refused to serve him something his wife ordered.  When the customer asked to speak to the owner this guy said, I AM THE OWNER!!  Honestly the way he was acting in a rage I think he was on major drugs....or, he has serious anger issues.  The 'owner' started screaming out his name and how his family has been in the neighborhood forever and other nonsense.  The customer must have felt threatened.  Hell, I felt threatened.   It ended with the 'owner' threatening to find the customer in the neighborhood and that the customer should watch his back because he knows everyone in town!   ARE YOUR SERIOUS?  This owner was going to hunt down the customer for expressing his opinion.  Class act.  \n\nThat would have been enough entertainment for my night but then it got better.   As the customer was leaving he shouted;  \"Oh you look like one of those \"yelpers\"....and made a sour faced gesture of a geek  typing at a keyboard. (no exaggeration)  He said \"what are you gonna  do, go write a bad review?\" then he laughed.  He said this so condescendingly, so rudely, so arrogantly, in front of so many people, I have no idea if this guy has any brain in his head? \n\nI mean isn't Le Trappe the beneficiary of a 4 stars review on yelp?  How much of his business is coming from \"yelpers\", the same \"yelpers\" he seems to despise so much? My guess would be A LOT! \n\nNow, I know this owner doesn't take advice well but I have some for you:  Don't bite the hand that's feeding you buddy.  The \"Yelpers\"  are clearly helping put food on your table.  Give props where it's due!\n\nI don't know what was wrong with this young owner.  Maybe he was just having a bad night.  And a negative comment of his perfect little business just wouldn't be tolerated...I'm not sure.  If I had to guess it's probably more a case of nepotism: mommy and daddy handing the keys to the restaurant to the bratty underachieving son with anger issues.  A great recipe for sure.\n\nLook, we've all run across jerky bartenders with attitude.  Le Trappe certainly has them and we learn to live with these types, but I've never seen a proprietor act so shamelessly.  I could never imagine in a thousand years that a  business owner would ever do such a thing to a customer for such an innocuous comment.  Because of the outright thuggery displayed at this place, I won't be back.  I felt dirty just sitting there.\n\nI'd suggest CHURCH KEY on Grant / near Vallejo for some great beers and great atmosphere without the attitude, and definitely without the hostility.  I'm also sure that they would appreciate your Yelps, unlike ahem.......Mr Whatshisface.\n\n3-Stars for beer and food. (decent but bland and overpriced)\n0-Stars for staff & service.

Really? There are 4 of us who are about to drop $8 apiece on a HALF-PINT, TIMES THREE OR FOUR, plus possible appetizers, but we don't merit a table for 2 1/2 hours while the tables upstairs sit empty and the bar is standing-room-only with the nice, big tables being occupied by sometimes only 2 diners each?\n\nAnd for a place of this caliber and price point, why isn't there table service in the lounge area?\n\nAll in all, I can definitely see the appeal of La Trappe, but I'll file it away as a potential \"date\" spot and keep going to my beloved dives.", "author": "Valeria R."}

Ok, there might be more but those are the only things I care about. \n\nFriday night I met up with some friends at La Trappe for a couple of beers and we were all impressed (so much so that one of my friends brought a group back on Saturday night) We tasted some fantastic beers and had a great conversation with one of the owners who filled us in on some of the history of the place. There are a few bistro tables  and an open kitchen upstairs but the highlight of the space is the basement dining room/bar. We nibbled on some tasty fries and were all salivating at the dishes coming out of the kitchen - this is the type of place where I could roll in solo and grab a burger and a couple of beers at the bar without feeling like a total loser.

I wonder what's down there...oh! It's the rest of the bar, and OoOoO look at all the pretty colors on the taps, and the bar is so smooth and look at the nice couches with it's pretty pillows and...well, you get the picture that I was about excited about the place as a 5 year old in a candy shop that was just handed 100 bucks.\n\nSo I'm sitting there, looking at the menu, and suddenly Keane's story pops into my head (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-trappe-san-francisco#hrid:P3hGSmY02YhIs-bt1hB-Sg).

Do you have any idea how difficult it is to take the awesomeness of this story, and try to explain it to someone else? It's hard. So hard, that I'm the only one laughing by the time I'm finished. \n\nBad story telling aside, the beers here are actually really awesome. The white beer, so light and flavourful, was awesome. The other two beers I tried were robust and full-bodied, and the bartender was extremely knowledgable about them and even offered me a taste. \n\nAt the end of the night, my friend said, \"You know...I would have thought it was 4 bucks too.\" Score!

They're super helpful about finding a beer that suits your taste buds.(I like bitter and not at all sweet- we got it right by beer #2). It gets really noisy downstairs so I wouldn't recommend for people wanting a quiet evening out. I like dark, loud, late dinners so I really enjoyed the scene. \n\nThe mussels were awesome!

Making it especially good is that we arrived shortly after 8pm and the only thing I had really eaten that day was a hot dog on the ferry to Alcatraz.\n\nI had several beers, wit, trippel, sour, etc.  Each were some of the best tasting beers I've had.  The special Lady friend scored some fruit beer that tasted like kool-aid and she put down quite a few of those.  Good times.\n\nThe food was very rich and tasty.  I got some chicken sausage and sauce... with fries.  Oh man, the dipping sauces with the fries are great.  My lady had a burger, which was was decent, but this place isn't known for their burgers.\n\nWe had to wait a LONG time for a table, but it was 8pm on a Friday night.  I didn't really mind, aside from the fact that I just came from Alcatraz and I was tired of being on my feet.  In all fairness the place is pretty small and we were downstairs and it is more of a bar, and not the type of place where people are leaving at regular dining intervals.  It's really not such a bad thing, I wasn't in a hurry, and it gave me plenty of time to try various beers.\n\nThis place rocks, I've already began informing people they know to go to SF and have a few drinks here.\n\nCheers,", "author": "Jeff C."}

This is what leads you to the downstairs bar.  I enjoyed drinking delicious beer in what feels like a cave.  It's cozy and comfortable.  They have a number of different seating areas, many which would work for large groups. \n\nThey have an amazing beer selection.  If you are not sure what you may like, talk to a bartender, they will help you.\n\nAfter enjoying our beer we placed an order for frittes (Belgian fries).  For four of us, we got two orders and six sauces so we could try them all.  The ginger mayo was my favorite, followed closely by one that tasted like bacon (chipotle?).  The fries were prepared well but were inconsistent in size which made dipping (and not also dipping your fingers) a bit difficult.  \n\nI look forward to returning to La Trappe soon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-27", "description": "I absolutely adored my experience at La Trappe when visiting San Francisco this past week. La Trappe was just a short walk down the hill from our hotel, which was incredibly convenient.\n\nUpon arriving you walk right into the kitchen/small restaurant area where the host told us to head downstairs for drinks and dinner. The downstairs area has no windows, but is dark and cozy, making for a great dinner and/or date spot. We were promptly greeted by our waiter who gave us the impressively long beer list and let us browse through it for a solid 10-15 minutes before checking back on us. It was hard to narrow down our selections, but my boyfriend and I went with a draft tripel and a saison, both of which we were happy with. \n\nAs we were sipping on our beers, we put in an order for the charcuterie plate. While this was being prepared the waiter brought us over some freshly made bread with butter. The bread was absolutely delicious--very soft and flavorful on the inside with a nice contrasting crunch of the crust. The charcuterie plate arrived a short time thereafter, which I was thankful for as we had done quite a number on the bread basket.  The charcuterie plate provided a great variety of delicious items, including cured duck sausage, garlic salami and pork rillette with a side of pickled onion and bell peppers. My favorites were the duck sausage and the salami, and the vegetables were slightly pickled which gave a nice contrast between the freshness of the vegetables and the vinegar flavor. I'd highly recommend getting this as a starter as it went wonderfully with our Belgian brews.\n\nFor the main plates, we decided to split two items, the first being the Birds Nest which was a trio of organic beef meatballs, breaded and deep fried with hard boiled quail egg in center and topped with a tomato based sauce. These were fantastic as all of the flavors complimented one another while standing out individually. The beef was flavorful and well seasoned and the richness of the quail egg was outstanding. They weren't overly breaded as many places tend to do and the frying process didn't rob the meatball of its unique flavor. As for our second dish, we went with the Mussels Mariniere which was cooked with shallots and onion that were sauteed in white wine, witbier, butter, creme fraiche and parsley served with fries and two dipping sauces of our choice. I absolutely adored this dish. The mussels were tender and soaked up all the flavors of the wine and witbier, and a silence descended upon our table as we enjoyed these. The frites were perfectly crispy and dipping sauces (Chipotle BBQ Mayo and Roasted Red Pepper) were great additions to the dish. I have no complaints whatsoever about the meal!\n\nWe finished our dining experience with another saison and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. It wasn't bad, but it fell short when compared to other tiramisus that I've had in the past. The dessert was a bit dry and lacked the almost overpoweringly strong coffee/espresso flavors.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and food came out promptly, so I have no complaints there.\n\nLa Trappe is definitely worth the visit, so if you're in the mood for frites, Belgian Beers, and mussels, definitely check this place out.", "author": "Megan K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-04", "description": "My husband and I went to La Trappe last night and it gets 5 stars for a few reasons.\n\n1. My husband has been to all the 7 Trappist monasteries. He did a beer trip to Belgium two years ago. He is a bit of a fanatic when it comes to beer...so if I can take him to a place where he can order some of his favorite beers (some on tap) and they come in the beers own special glass-five stars for making him smile. \n\n2. Service. We arrived at 6pm on a Friday night and went straight downstairs. We picked a small table for the two of us. Our server, at tall beautiful gal, explained a couple of changes on the menu to us. She was very attentive and kind. Towards the end of our meal the place was packed and I was worried that the service was going to go south but I started to realize that other people were helping her. Moving plates on and off the table, refilling waters etc. All the staff worked as a team to keep everyone happy and that really impressed me-5 stars.\n\n3. Food...We had a cheese plate. 2 cheeses were $12 dollars. Typically when we order cheese you get such a small amount. NOT HERE. Holy Queso my friends! There was so much cheese as well as grapes, honey, dates, olives, gherkins and this delicious dark nutty bread. My husband had the lasagna which was moist and very tasty. It wasn't an Italian lasagna but was very flavorful and a welcome surprise. I order The Boudin Blanc. Dear god. There are no words. The sausage was amazing, the gratin was cheesy and flavorful...bring it all together with the sauce and it's like an orgasm in your mouth! 5 stars!\n\n4. They have Duchesse Du Bourgogne on tap. This alone gets the place 5 stars. Not many people are into Flemish Sour Ales but I am. I didn't see anyone else order one that night. I have a feeling that if all those women that ordered wine would have been a little adventurous they could have enjoyed something so amazing and not a glass of wine made 20 miles away.

It was around 9pm, and surprisingly, the downstairs bar was not terribly crowded. Prices were fair, and it was easy to get the beer that I wanted. The selection was heavy on certain types, light on some others. I don't know if they were going for a certain theme, but being in SF, I was on a hop kick, and there wasn't anything that was exciting me. We had just missed PTY, so that wasn't happening. I split after one beer, mostly because I was tired.\n\nComing from Philadelphia, which is a bit of a beer mecca (Monk's and Eulogy to name a few places), I wasn't terribly impressed.

Had a few drinks downstairs and was ready for food and found out that it was a 45 min. wait for a table downstairs, so upstairs we went for grub and immediate service.\n\nTried the Mussels with Fries (and don't say \"french\" fry) and it was nice that you picked the style of broth (i picked fennel, shallot, tomato and white wine aka pastis) and a couple of flavors for your mayo cuz that's what they dip their fries into over across the Atlantic.  The dish was good with the mussels being plentiful but small, but the broth smelled better than it tasted, maybe under-seasoned.  I expected the \"belgian\" fries to be better but it wasn't any different than say a frozen fry at a greasy spoon.  The mayo for dipping was homemade and spot on.\n\nOther members of our table ordered their Braised Rabbit ($24), which was heavily sauced with a tomato and bacon reduction with the end product being real close to store bought bbq sauce.  Not bad tasting, (actually the dish tasted like bbq chicken, if you would've been blindfolded) but maybe was just expecting something more/better.\n\nWhere this place excels however is in the beer menu.  Their menu resembles a fine dining restaurants wine \"book\", yes book, not list, and reading it is like browsing through a Western Civilization history book, with stories of Abbeys and monasteries with long histories of brewing.  \n\nI tried a very tart Flemish Red which was unique, but the star was this Duchese de Bourgogne, a brownish redish beer with a very complex flavor and the most perfect balance of tart and sweet.  It was cherry, raspberry and caramel notes on every sip and it lingered.  I've had many beers over the years but this stamped an impression on my palatte front and center.

Location (near streetcar line and bus line in North Beach) is very convenient.. The hours of the restaurant seem to be kinda strange, I actually tried to come here twice before and was not able to because it was closed when it seemed like it should be open.

From the outside it looks small and cozy and never super busy. Friday night rolled around and we decided mussels and fries sounded pretty Belgian and tasty so we pulled on our boots, grabbed our coats, and marched our way down the hill to what was supposed to be a cozy little eatery. \n\nWe walk in to what I later found out was just the top floor and were promptly ignored by the two waitresses walking by. It was obvious we had NO idea that we needed to go down stairs to put our names in. After standing there for five minutes we finally asked only to be told to put our names in at the bar. So, we headed down stairs only to find a medium sized room PACKED with people. After finally making our way to the bar we put our name in and waited. Upon looking around and checking out the different crowds of people that were there I had to note that the beer must be STRONG if there was a table of four tourists where one was passed out at the table and another kept knocking over her chair. hmmm.. note to self... take it easy on the beer. \n\n40 minutes later we had already finished one beer and were finally seated at a small table. We ordered Fries and mussels to start along with a seafood palooza plate for him and a fried portabella mushroom burger stuffed with goats cheese for me. And don't forget the 2nd and third rounds of beers as well. The food arrived about another 40 minutes later and even though I was a little perturbed that it took so long the atmosphere and energy were positive and the food was worth waiting for. \n\nOMG, the fries with the spicy ketchup, red pepper aioli, and wasabi mayo sauce was finger licking good. The mussels were perfect and the sauce they came in ... OMG. The main course is kind of a blur due to the food coma and amount of beer I had already consumed but I know it was delectable. \n\nOverall, I had alot of fun at this place and would totally go back with a group of people or even with just my man again.

In my opinion, I think this is the kind of beer that a person should enjoy sitting down over light conversation.\n\nI just happened to come here to help celebrate an old friend's birthday and we took up a lot of space. There were probably 25 of us congregating all over the open area. They were still open to dinner the time we were inside. \n\nLast call for drinks was at 11:30pm and the bar was closed by midnight. A few of us headed back out to North Beach to get a snack at Golden Boy and satisfy our munchies cravings. I would make another trip out to La Trappe in the near future and get to know their varieties of fine Belgium beer and food. As unique as it is, La Trappe is a definite 'must try!'", "author": "Hogan W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-08", "description": "Two things I hate more than anything when I dine out: going with a large group where someone isn't on time, and a restaurant that makes you feel like the worst customer because you are with a large group where not everyone is on time. \n\nOn one hand, I don't want to wait an hour and half for everyone to show up and THEN start to wait for the next table available (supposedly there is only one place in La Trappe that fits 10 people), on the other hand, I can see why the staff is irritated that our group got bigger and bigger over the night around our table that's supposed to fit 7. \n\nActually, I don't really see why the staff got that irritated. We never burdened them with our problem. We just kept on getting cozier and cozier as more people came. And we asked people around us for empty chairs and everyone around us was totally cool about it (afterall, no tables crammed like we did; most tables that seat four comfortably were occupied by two people.) And it's not like the late-comers didn't order anything and just took up space. \n\nMaybe the staff is just over worked, so the mere thought of having to rearrange chairs after we leave got them all riled up. In the entire basement, there was one waitress and one guy who waited AND acted as the host. \n\nThe food came out pretty slow after we ordered, but it was okay because everyone was enjoying their beers. Most of us got the moules et frites for $17. I got moules mariniere which was a bit overcooked. I chose spicy ketchup and curry ketchup as my condiments for the fries and spicy ketchup reminded me of sriracha sauce. Fries were fine, but I am not sure if you can really mess up fries. \n\nDespite the mediocre food and grumpy service, there were a couple of highlights of La Trappe. We came with a friend who is Belgian and he totally endorsed it. He had been here before and thought the food was authentic. And he licked his bowl of rabbit stew clean, so it must have been good. \n\nThe restaurant itself is super cute. The basement is a bit stuffy, but still really spacious and comfortable for a basement. The lighting was great: not too bright, not too dim. \n\nThe beer selection is outstanding. They have a whole binder of choices and have (if i remember correctly) 19 beers on tap. It reminds me of my favorite hang out when I lived in Lyon, this cozy bar called La palais de la biere where our manly friends can enjoy brews that are way too bitter for me, and I can enjoy a very girlie framboise bierre. And I don't think SF has places like this, so this really fills a void for all the beer lovers here. \n\nSo, if you want to impress your beer connoisseur friends (don't bring more than 3) while munch on some Belgian food, this is a perfect and chill place. But don't try to come here with a large group. It'll drive you and the staff crazy.", "author": "Candice B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-07-15", "description": "I should come clean and start by saying that I went into La Trappe with a giant bias. My mom is from Belgium, I went there every few years growing up, and I was literally there three weeks ago, so I may have a big Belgian chip on my shoulder. I went into La Trappe expecting reasonable greatness, and I ended up finding good-ish food but horrendously overpriced beers. This was, in short, disappointing.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers have said, the beer selection at La Trappe is huge. You pretty much need the drink menu to sort through all your options, and there are pages and pages of options. My issue was with the prices of the selections. Okay, I know we're in San Francisco and drinks aren't cheap here (and yes, I was spoiled by the cheap Belgian beer in, you know, Belgium), but this was too much. The basest Belgian beer will put you out $7, and if you want anything you've (or I've) heard of, you're looking at spending A LOT more. I gravitated immediately towards the Lindeman's Kriek and Gueuze, family favorites, and was shocked to see that they were on the menu for $29. \"Maybe it's a giant bottle,\" I thought to myself. No siree, it's $29 for your run-of-the-mill 12 oz. bottle. And yes, I do realize that importing beer is expensive, but you can go down to Cost Plus World Market to buy Lindemans and you won't pay more than $9 for a big bottle. I resigned myself to a cheaper, less delicious beer and put our group's name on the list for a table.\n\nHere's where I had another issue with La Trappe. We were a group of eight, and I know that that can be very hard to accommodate, especially on a Saturday night in the city. When I arrived there were only two of us, so I was more than happy to wait at the bar with my cheap beer for a while until more people in our group arrived. Not too much later, we had six of our eight people and asked if we could be seated. Unfortunately, we were told that we couldn't be seated until our full group had arrived, and any other full groups that came in the meantime could take the table we had our eyes on. In principle, this seems like a pretty good system so you don't have groups taking up a table long before they're ready, but I know that when we came in, we were asked if we were a part of a partial group that was... already sitting at a table. I don't mind being told to wait, but not if I know the rules aren't being applied across the board.\n\nYou'll be shocked to hear that by the time our last two people showed up, our table had been taken not five minutes before. We were told we could wait in the lounge area, but we could only have appetizers there and not the regular entrees. Since we had a show to get to, we decided that appetizers would be the best option; there were a lot of choices and many were just smaller plates of the entrees anyways. The group had several orders of twice-cooked fries and beef sliders, and a few people tried the mussels, mac n cheese, and \"Chicken Videe,\" a kind of take on chicken pot pie. There's a great selection of dipping sauces for the fries, and aside from a lack of salt (I suppose if we weren't in the lounge we could have used the table salt), they were pretty good. Everyone seemed to enjoy the sliders, especially with the Chimay cheese, and the couple who got the mac n cheese raved about it. All-in-all, the food was enjoyable and reasonably priced for the amount we got.\n\nGood food aside, I still couldn't get over the drink prices and the inconsistent service we received from the host (I should say that the bartenders were very nice). Maybe you'll think my two-star rating is a little harsh, but I won't be bringing my Belgian mom here any time soon.", "author": "Kristen L."}

Actually, the resumed search was for ANY Belgian bar in SF.  Note to the establishments who bill themselves as Belgian bars: I know that Chimay is a Trappiste Ale- just because you have on tap among Anchor Steam and Sierra doesn't qualify you as a Belgian bar.  I was in search for the real deal- a place with a big binder of Belgian brews I can't pronounce and a menu loaded with different flavors of moules, frites, and stews.\n\nWhen I arrived at La Trappe, I was greeted with an empty, dead dining room.  But there were steps leading downstairs and smells of malt and mussels wafting from below.  Downstairs, I was greeted with a lively, packed lounge of patrons.  The first thing I noticed was Gulden Draak and Rodenbach Grand Cru, two of my favorite Belgian brews, on tap!  Next, I was handed a thick binder of an extensive Belgian beer selection.  So far, La Trappe is passing the authenticity test.\n\nThe menu was authentic, although somewhat limited (only 4 or 5 entrees offered).  It had the standard staples of moules and frites.  The frites were very authentic- double fried and served with different types of aioli.  For the entree, I want with the Chicken Gentse Waterzooi- a traditional hearty stew with chicken and vegetables in a lightly seasoned cream broth.  It was well-done with fresh ingredients, but could have used a bit more flavor.\n\nOverall, La Trappe seems to be your best bet in SF for a true Belgian experience.  I'm looking forward to returning again.", "author": "Mike B."}

There's usually about 12 Belgians on tap and a variety of other interesting styles or varieties, including domestic takes on Belgian beer.

Either way you're going to have excellent beers, hearty food, and great ambiance; it's simply a question of how long you want to wait for it.\n\nYou can eat upstairs, but I recommend the basement, with its rustic brick walls, dim lighting, and bar crowd that provides an ideal locale for good company and beer. On a weeknight the sound level is perfect for conversations while still feeling decently full. On weekends, I recently waited an hour for a table (no reservations accepted) and it was uncomfortably crowded and more suitable for drinking than dinner. \n\nNonetheless, the meal was superbly satisfying once it arrived. In true Belgian form, they specialize in moules frites (mussels and french fries) which are served up in many different forms - classic mariniere (beer sauce), provencal, spicy tomato, and an alternative coconut curry sauce. They're all served with two dipping sauces you get to choose (wasabi mayo, roasted red pepper aioli, etc.) I've also had the boudin blanc sausage, which was served in a tasty mustard sauce over a potato leek gratin. The cheese plates are also a good starter.\n\nOf course you're really coming for the beer list, which is extensive. A good number on tap, and many many more to choose from. I buy a number of Belgian beers from Whole Foods and I must say, however, that La Trappe does mark up their prices considerably. But if you're coming for these calibers of beer, you probably weren't expecting anything cheap anyhow.\n\nMy friend likened his last experience to coming into a small Belgian tavern for some hearty food and tasty beer to escape the winter cold.

On its walls were black and white images of people and places in France and Belgium.  I felt like I was in Belgium again.\n\nMoules frites, belgian beer, and rabbit stew graced the pages of its menu.

Fifty pages of lambics, whites, trippels, Trappist beers, and abbey ales filled it's menu.\n\nI began my journey with the Cherish Kriek.  Basically, it is a champagne-like beer, brewed with love and the taste of cherries.  This is a very popular drink in Belgium, second only to the infamous Lambic.\n\nMany beers were being passed around the table, such as blondes and trippels, but the greatest beer adventure was the \"La grande Blanche\"  7.5% white beer. Hazy golden amber color.  A complex combination of tastes and aromas such as orange peel, mango pudding and lychee nut.  The finish was \"sweet citrus spice, buttered bread and delicate herbal undertones\".\n\nAside from the Belgians, there are Canadians and German, as well as Italian and Japanese beers.\n\nIt was a thoroughly enjoyable experience, feeling like I was no longer in the Americas, but back in a centuries old pub drinking beer brewed by trappist monks.\n\nI highly recommend this as a place to meet with friends, sample beers, and eat mussels and fries.

You walk down a dark staircase that leads you to a room with a bar and tables where jolly people laugh and chat with one another.  It makes you feel special.

I can't remember which mussels dish I had, but I really enjoyed it.  My wife also had mussels and enjoyed them as well.  Between the two of us we tried four of the sauces for the frites.  One of the spicier ones was our favorite (can't remember which one it was).\n\nNow on to the good stuff.  If you like Belgian beer, I don't know why you would go anywhere else in SF.  This place has the largest selection I've ever seen outside of Belgium itself.  Yes, I'm dead serious.  My wife and I spent about two weeks in Belgium in 2008 and the beer list at La Trappe would rival many of the places we visited in Bruges, Brussels, Dinant, and other cities.  Not all beers on the menu at La Trappe are from Belgium, but I didn't see one that wasn't either from Belgium or a Belgian style (Triple, Quad, etc).\n\nPerhaps my favorite thing about this place was the beer menu.  Not just the selection of beers, but the physical menu itself.  The organization was unlike anything I've ever seen.  The beers were listed by style, but each style had a definition of said style.  The section on Trappist beers was nice to see as well.  If I recall, the beers are also listed alphabetically.  I've never seen so much thought put into a beer menu like that.  If I was a clepto, I totally would have walked out with one (I didn't).\n\nWe dined downstairs in the corner and received good service.  Our waitress seemed fairly knowledgeable about some of the beers my wife asked about.  I ended up having Rochefort 6, St. Feuillien Triple, and Orval (one of my favorites of all time).\n\nLike the Publick House in Boston, if I'm every back in SF, you'll most certainly find me here.

It's also pretty close to where I live, but I wish there were more bars like this on Polk st in Nob Hill.  I was really dissapointed with the selection a few blocks down and actually with SF in general.  However, La Trappe definitely did not dissappoint.", "author": "Paul W."}

Heaven!! \n\nIf you're headed to La Trappe for the mussels and are indecisive about the four different ways they are served, here are my favorites in order of preference: \n\n1) Provencal (White wine and garlic tomato sauce with parsley)\n2) Spicy Tomato (tomatos, pureed with rosemary and dried chili)\n3) Mariniere (white beer sauce with lemon, shallots, and fresh herbs)\n4) Coconut Curry on Jasmine Rice (Jalape\u00f1os, lemon grass, cilantro and fresh lime juice)\n\nThe mussels come with twice cooked fries... can we say fried heaven? You have the choice of two of eight dipping sauces. Favorites were Roasted Red Pepper Aoli, Honey Graham Dijon Aoli and Spicy Ketchup. \n\nI would love to comment on the EXTENSIVE beer list; however, I just listened to the server's recommendations as I held the 2390438 page beer menu in my hand. Ok, I exaggerate but as an amateur beer drinker, I entrusted my beer choice to the waitress and was not disappointed.\n\nMy advice is to call for a reservation to ensure a seat downstairs in the more lively drinking and dining area.

Swiss Chocolate?  French Fries?  No, no no; Belgian, Belgian, Belgian.  Ahh, Belgie.  What do the smurfs and the saxophone have in common?  That's right, Belgian.

Great, cosy decor, wood, stone and even some stained glass and a fountain.  Nice job.\n\nThe beer list is great.  They don't have my favorite, Westvleteren, but that is really tough to find, since the monks that make it are strictly old school (like, medieval old school) and only sell it right out of the Abbey.  Check it out.  http://www.sintsixtus.be/eng/brouwerij.htm  (Toronado is the only place I've ever found it stateside.)  But La Trappe had all of the other trappist beers, and a lot more.  \n\nAs for the food, they not only have the usual suspects, mussels and fries, they have stuff my grandmother used to make, like rabbit and even (gasp) the classic Belgian stew, waterzooi!  I actually wasn't crazy about the food (had the rabbit, mussels and fries, which were all on the bland side), and our server was a little absent-minded, but hats off to the owner for putting these Belgian classics on offer.  \n\nBottom line:  For a taste of Belgium, check this place out.", "author": "Peter V."}

The Belgian Beer Selection is quite impressive, but the the \"on tap\" beer sizes vary and most selections are only offered in a single size.  I am used to being able to order any beer in 2 or 3 sizes when in Belgium.  For the most part I thought the Beer was overpriced (at least the beer that you can find at other establishments around town).  I tried a few different beers with my meal which I ate in the cellar. \n\nThe food did not knock my socks off.  The \"grass fed\" burger was nothing to write home about... I didn't even finish it despite being hungry.  The fries were delicious, but not worth making a trip back for, I would probably head to Frjtz if that was what I was craving (they have more dipping sauces). My companion had mussels and fries which were served in a huge pot  filled above the brim, but they did not match the mussels I had a day earlier in Belden Alley, although there were more of them.\n\nThe round table for two was so tiny that our food and drinks were fighting for places to sit and helped to make the place feel even more cramped than it already was.  We asked if we could move to a slightly larger empty table when the food arrived, but were told someone was waiting for it.   It sat empty until just before we finished our meal. The noise level was incredible.  It was very hard to communicate and be heard despite there being a few empty tables while we were dining.  \n\nI might come back here for beer and appetizers if I planned on sitting at the bar or if I had friends who wanted to drink Belgian beers in North Beach.  However, I don't think it is worth going out of your way to eat or drink here. It is very small, so not great for large groups.  The noise level due to the low ceiling prevents it from being cozy.

(BOOM! POW!! Right off the bat I'm throwin' around names like Naomi Campbell throws phones. I probably should have used a Larry Bird or a sports simile but my first instinct was to go the supermodel route. What does that say about me Dr. Freud??) He was telling us the history of the building which has been in his family for years. During prohibition his family used the basement as their own hidden speakeasy/distillery, and it still has that feeling to it which is fantastic. In fact, from the outside La Trappe doesn't look like much. A small restaurant with a couple of tables... no biggie. It's not til you walk down the winding stairwell that you get to the heart of La Trappe.   It's intimate, welcoming, and tastefully decorated. \n\nEnough of that namby pamby interior decorator bullshit... Let's talk beer!! Are Belgium Beer Bars becoming the new Wine Bar?? There's the new Trappist in Oaktown and this spot. If so, I wouldn't mind that trend at all, because the beer we had here was crazy delicious. I wish I could remember the names because they had beer on tap that no one else on the West Coast has... and it was fantastic. Their been menu is slightly overwhelming but the staff behind the bar will guide you to the right choice.\n\nAlong with the great beer they have some seriously great food. We split the mini-burgers (the beef they used is from Marin Sun Farms) and the mussles and fries. The mussles came out in the pot they cooked them in and my wife is still talking about the cute presentation... and this was weeks ago.

Date me, dump me, then let me take you out to a nice dinner for your birthday. I'm that nice. I could have chosen Taco Bell or some equivalent, but no, I chose an amazing restaurant with an incredible beer selection for my former lover's birthday. \n\nEverything* about this place I love. The ambiance is perfect. Love the cave for private parties (hi phil!), the checkerboard tables, the speakeasy feel. \n\nThe food was top notch. We had the pancetta wrapped shrimp, pork in a beer reduction with amazing brussel sprouts, and the rabbit stew. For dessert we had some chocolate hazelnut pudding thing with raspberry sauce. Every bite was delicious. \n\nThe beer was incredible. I always forget how fruity the blondes can be. (and no I'm not talking about me. or my faux date ex boyfriend). Having such a wide selection we took our time with the beer list. Everything we picked was great though. And our waitress had fun trying to teach us how to say them properly. I tried the whole point and say the one part of the beer you think you know, and she'd reply, \"Oh? you mean the crazyforeignicantrememeberwhattocallit beer? You'll love it, it's got a great bite.\" Uh... yeah. What she said. \n\nThe worst part of the meal, besides the whole staring into the eyes of the man who broke my heart thing, was this woman dining a few tables away. OMG. SHUT UP. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR IMPERSONATION OF MIKE MYERS IN SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER. YOU HAVE THE LOUDEST SHRIEKIEST VOICE I HAVE EVER HEARD AND MY EAR DRUMS LITERALLY HURT FOR THREE DAYS. HOW DO YOU HAVE FRIENDS? Seriously. SHUT UP. Conversation was extremely difficult having to wait between shrieks and it's a bit hard to put the fork in your mouth when you have to plug your ears. Bonus points to the waitress for making fun of her and apologizing to us about her ambiance-ruining abilities. \n\n*The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is three things. And they are minor and easy to fix. \n\nFirst - when I ask for my food to be boxed up, I meant all of it. Not just part of it. I purposely saved half of my brussel sprouts so that when I heated up the pork I would have something to go with it. Also, please include the sauce. Every chef should know that when reheating moisture will be lost, so all that sauce sitting at the bottom of the plate, please pour it over the pork so I'm not chomping at a dry piece of rubber the next day. Having the meal taste good the next day just reminds your customers of how great it was the first time and brings them back. \n\nSecond - Please print more menus. There aren't enough for every table so we couldn't keep the beer list with us the whole time even though it was one of the big things we were looking at and talking about during dinner. We are HUGE beer fans so we like to compare and contrast and find the ones we haven't had. It is likely to be a passion of a lot of patrons, so having lots of beer lists will only benefit you. \n\nThird- Make a real host stand at the entrance. Being greeted by the chef and a waiter picking up food is great but I think people immediately feel lost when walking in.\n\nThese minor complaints aside. I absolutely love this place and can't wait for another ex to have a birthday.", "author": "Ali R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-10", "description": "I was very excited when I found out that there would be a Belgian beer bar and restaurant opening in my neighborhood. If it's not obvious already, I'm a big fan of beer - even brewing my own - and Belgian ones are widely considered to be the paragon of said beverage. Dubbels, trippels, quadrupels, saisons, lambics, Flanders red ales - very, very, very tasty. So I was looking forward to visiting La Trappe. Unfortunately, they had issues in the first couple of months after opening - irregular hours and problems with equipment kept me away.\n\nHowever, all that is past. I've only visited twice, but hopefully that plus $150 left behind (mostly spent on beer of course) qualifies me to say a few words. The place is split-level: a few tables upstairs and a big, Belgium-style \"beer cave\" downstairs. There is a bar and a few tables, which can accommodate parties from 2 to 10 people. The food menu is quite decent, if not extensive. I had a salad and some moules et frites here. The moules were good, but a bit on the small side, and the frites didn't quite compare to the ones served at Frjtz.\n\nThe beer menu on the other hand is extensive. There are about 30 beers on tap and 100+ in bottles. The vast majority are Belgians exhibiting the full range of the styles, with a few Belgian-style ones from other countries. Prices range from $6 to $30 per serving. You have to realize that some beers are served in big, champagne-size (750ml) bottles, so that $18 gets you a long way towards beer bliss. I've probably sampled 10 beers here and enjoyed all but one. Belgian beers are generally higher in alcohol content, reaching 10-11% sometimes, so don't expect to pound down a dozen in one sitting unless you want to be carried out rather than walk out. These beers with their complex aromas and flavors are made for tasting and you can spend a great evening doing just that with a couple of friends.\n\nThe service is a bit spotty. On the first visit, it took forever to order our beers on each round, but the second time around was better. The servers seem to know the menu fairly well, but are not experts in all the beers obviously. I'd try to research the beers on a site like BeerAdvocate.com before coming here and definitely take notes so that you know which ones you liked and didn't like.\n\nI'll definitely be back to continue sampling the beers. If you happen to visit, try Zoetzuur Flemish Red and see why beers can be as complex as wines.", "author": "Andrei Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-15", "description": "I met a friend for dinner here last Thursday night. She had recently broken her foot, so I waited for her upstairs. Downstairs seems to be where the party's at though - it was so loud you could hear everything upstairs, and it seemed really crowded. Service wasn't exactly prompt or attentive, and confusingly, we had at least three different servers. It seemed like we waited quite a while for one of the three to notice that we were definitively ready to order.\nThe only reason to come to a Belgian place aside from the beer is to try the classic Moules Frites. So we went for the traditional Mariniere preparation with white wine and shallots. A steaming cauldron of mussels & broth showed up. I asked for an additional bowl and got a perplexed look. We were *sharing* - was I supposed to lean over my friend's shoulder and pick out my mussels from the pot on her side of the table? The mussels that we were able to eat were delicious. Unfortunately, at least 6 or 7 of the mussels at the bottom of the pot were still closed, ergo inedible. The broth was a little watery as well, but had good flavor. The cone of frites was on the average side. It was a good-sized portion to share, but the fries were quite unevenly fried - some nice and crispy, others limp. The roasted garlic mayo and the spicy ketchup were both very tasty though.\nI'll reserve my highest praise for the beer selection. There is so much going on with this beer list! Their draft selection is extensive, and then there's an additional bottle list! It's organized by style and even includes a brief glossary of beer styles, which is very helpful. We had 4 beers in total, including the St. Feuillien Trippel, the Affligem Blond, the Ertvelds Wit, and the Ephemere Cassis. All except the Canadian Ephemere were Belgian, but they were all incredibly good and arrived in the appropriate glassware. The Ephemere was a great \"dessert\" beer - the cassis flavor wasn't overpowering at all, just subtly tart. I really want to come with a larger group so that we can explore the bottle list a bit more - they apparently have over 400 beers.\nIf this place stepped up the service, I'd definitely award another star. I'd also love to come back to try the Moules Pastis appetizer because it sounds delicious: baked mussels in a fennel & Pastis sauce, yum!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Strikes 1, 2 and 3 all happened this past Saturday night.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I love their beer list, I love their food, and I love their interior.  So I took some significant douchebaginess to earn my dislike.\n\nWe came on Saturday around 10PM,  knowing they close at midnight.  We had our first beer and just about 11:30, went up for a final round.  There were two bartenders, one who was helping the waiters and still providing beer, and another who seemed to be pissed at the world about his horribly difficult life working at La Trappe.  A waiter tells us last call was at 11:30.  I look at my watch and it's 11:32.  I also look at where we're sitting, about 12 feet from the bar, and wonder how 4 people could have missed any announcement about last call, until I realized there hadn't been one.\n\nWe continue to wait, hoping for service, when the nice bartender leaves to grab a last beer for one of the tables.  The other bartender, Captain McDouche, storms by us and says \"We're not serving any more beer\", before slamming some stuff around in the sink.  We keep waiting, hoping for either the other bartender, or the opportunity to close our our tab.  When Captain McDouche comes back and repeats his not-so-friendly admonition, we have to practically throw something at him to get his attention for our tab.  All in all, great service.\n\nStrikes 1 and 2 for not calling last call and for such an awesome, passive aggressive, 14 year old pubescent bartender.  Strike 3 came in that my girlfriend left her cell phone there and it has, of course disappeared.  This obviously happens, but it's rare that you can prove it had to be a La Trappe staff member who took it.  She left her phone on the table while we were putting on our jackets to leave - I saw it, and she saw it and each thought the other would grab it.  We were literally the last people to walk out up the stairs Saturday at midnight and they are closed Sunday and Monday.  We called, stopped by, etc., and no one could get downstairs to check on it until Tuesday.  When we got back there, it was gone and the person we talked to swore that nobody there would have taken it.  Sorry buddy, but that ain't true.", "author": "Matt Z."}

However, beneath the street level dining space is a wonderfully cozy bar and eating area overflowing with an old world vibe.  There is a private enclave that you can reserve for parties (seats at least 12).  \n\nThis is the closest I've been to eating at a European bistro since I was in, well, Europe (go figure!)  La Trappe made me long for a computer so I could log onto Expedia and book my next trip to Euro-land (i.e. it gives you the warm fuzzy \"I'm on vacation\" feeling)\n\nIn addition, La Trappe satisfies one of my many food fantasies: beer and food pairing (because I am too gauche for wine and food pairing)\n\nThey have such a wide selection of interesting beers, and the owner/staff is eager to help you pair them to your appetizer/dinner/dessert.\n\nFinally, I can feel a little more sophisticated without having to relinquish my beer!

This place is simply one of the best bars that I've been to in the past few years for a couple of relaxing drinks with friends.  I've been very stingy with my 5-Star ratings, striving for a normal distribution in my reviews.  La Trappe gets 5 stars from me, for the stellar beer selection, cozy/sophisticated European decor, and the comprehensive Belgium Ale manual of a menu.  \n\nMy friends and I got there around 7pm on a Saturday night.  I initially thought that it was an empty bar, as that's how it looked from the outside.  To my surprise, we went downstairs into the basement area, and found the main event.  The basement bar was an intimate space, featuring soft, indirect lighting gently accented by masterfully coordinated red walls and yellow light fixtures.  The couches in the back area create the prime real estate that optimizes the combination of lighting, exposed brick pillars, and a one-way mirror looking into the outside of the restroom that definitely gives you something to talk about!\n\nThe process of selecting our drinks was more like choosing a sophisticated wine at a wine bar.  Except that for the old friends that I was there with, talking about each beer was more than just about the flavor.  Each beer they spoke of also triggered fond memories.  I get the sense that these Belgian brews also came with the magical properties of story making with every drink.  \n\nIt is a great place to get lost in the moment there, exploring and learning about Belgian Ales with close friends.  For us, that moment ended up running 3 hours.  I am definitely coming back to La Trappe!", "author": "Leo C."}

To start, we were seated fairly promptly and then placed our orders for Beer and apps.  The beer (Brasserie De Roc, Saison Dupont, and Affligem) delivered and were quite yummy.  The apps (smoked trout in endive cups and the salad were mediocre.  \n\nThen we placed our orders for dinner (2 orders of the mussels and fries, 1 S.F. Burger, and 1 Portobello w/ Polenta) which didn't make it to our table for close to an hour.  Given the fact that there were only 7 other tables with people and 3 cooks upstairs, that was unacceptable.  \n\nThe Food: mussels were small and had little taste to it.  There was a lack of broth, which would have helped retain some of the flavor.  The fries that came with it was rather dry and didn't have much over say.. McDonald's fries.  The buddy that had the burger was extremely disappointed with what was brought onto the plate.  The burger was dry, tasteless, overcooked (he ordered medium and the meat looked a dark grey) and the Portabello and Polenta was undercooked.  \n\nOverall this is how the scores stacked up:\n\nBeer - 4 Stars  Weighting Factor  20%\nAtmosphere - 4 Stars                     20%\nFood - 1 Star                                    50%\nService - 1 Star                                10%\nOVERALL - 1  1/2 STARS             100%\n\nSo, I would come back to grab a beer but not eat any of the food, if you can call it that!", "author": "Tom L."}

Not only do they have a very, very good selection of Belgians both in bottles and on tap, the food are also quite tasty.  Our little group was very satisfied by the end of the night. The North Beach location, with a view of the cable cars running up and down and a view of Coit Tower, is also a nice touch, like the best of SF and Belgium combined. Sure, Toronado's location might be more \"authentic\" (Seriously, if you've been to Brussels you know that 3/4 of that city looks like Lower Height anyway), but there is a reason I live in (or near) San Francisco, not Brussels.\n\nThe service was a bit slow (waiting for a table despite reservation, waiting for beer, waiting for server), but since they just opened I'll give them a little time.\n\nFinally, a wonderful Belgian place in SF.

I harassed my friend, inquiring why we had to trek miles away, into the middle of residential area, past perfectly good bars. Especially since he didn't know the exact name of it, only that it was \"some belgian beer place\". Finally we're at the corner Greenwich and Columbus. Only there's no bar. Only a restaurant  with three tables in it.\n\nWe found an awning, my buddy called his source and low and behold, this itsy-bitsy place is it. We enter skeptically. But there's a stair case. A gorgeous , dark-stained wooden staircase with black metal railings. It's almost like that moment in \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" where Lucy's expects the back of the closet to be there but there's actually no back and it leads into snowy woods. It was like entering another universe (ok maybe not that extreme but at least another country!). The downstairs is beautiful, there's a long bar on the right and to the left are tables, longer, Hofbrauhaus-style. The walls are brick, and slant at a slightly inward angle towards the bottom. The whole place is very soothingly lit with a variety of hanging ironwork lamps.\n\nIn the very back there's a lounge area, black leather couches, some small tables. Ideal for a group of people to hang out and drink Belgian ale that comes in goblets. We chatted with the owner for a while, he is a very cool gentleman and gave us some great suggestions for beverages we should try. \n\nAnother thing I loved about this place was that the music was very low, so it was easy to carry on a conversation.\n\n5 stars for atmosphere, and a variety of beer I haven't tried before.

(He said he would help us out as our waiter seemed to be \"tied up\" - but we didn't saw \"our\" waiter for at least another half hour.)\n\nWhat happened next may show why there was such slow service.The waiter seemed to go to the bar, try to get one of the overwhelmed bartender's attention, and then wait while the the barman actually poured our beers. Surely the waiter had something better to do other than wait?\n\nThe best things about the service were the bus boys - there seemed to be two of them constantly filling glasses with water. Seemed like overkill to me - people are not here for the water - they are here for the beer! Someone should have given those guys a tray an had them delivering our drinks.\n\nFrom this point of view, I should award La Trappe just one star. But the food was good and the beer was excellent and well priced, so guess two will do for now.\n\nI hate to write a bad review. I will have to return when it is not quite so busy - maybe they can win another star or two.", "author": "Kingpin X."}

As i perused the menu of beers the only thing catching my eyes was the column telling of alcohol content. I have never in my life seen so many beers with 11-12% alcohol content. I heart Belgian beer.\n\nThe food was excellent from what I recall(mind you, I was into my third or fourth glass of the 12% beer at this time). The mussels and frittes(fries) is a steaming pot of mussels placed in front of you and a cone of fries on the side. The steak was not bad but it wasn't memorable either. The rabbit stew was the highlight of the night. The meat just melted in your mouth and they plate it over polenta which I found excellent. I've never liked polenta by itself but with stew I found that it is one of those pairings that was meant to be like pb/jelly, spaghetti/meatballs, corned beef/cabbage, chitlings/ducks blood?!... I am so used to the american way of plating stew with mashed potatoes that the polenta at La Trappe was such a refreshing new take on stew. It feels lighter and carried more texture than your typical mashers that can feel like an anvil in your stomach.\n\nAnd since this was a belgian restaurant, theres not a better way to end the night but with a plate of belgian waffles, strawberries and whip cream. A little too sweet for my taste but none the less fulfilling. \n\nPrice and ambiance is a bargain for the area. The beer was the only thing out of whack at $8 a glass but then you come to realize that the 12% makes up for it. There were just as many people sitting and eating as there were drinking and hanging out at the bar which was all in one room in the basement. It was a nice mixture that didn't get too intrusive to either groups.", "author": "Ron T."}

They have a respectable menu of beers on tap, but the impressive part is when you open the ~50 page menu of bottled beers that they have in the fridge.  \n\nAmbiance was excellent.  Upstairs is nice, but the key is below ground.  They have turned downstairs into a dimly lit, well decorated, midscale bar with a limited amount of seating for dining.  They have a small lounge in the back, but probably only 10-15 people can sit back there, very small.  I was disappointed that our group was quoted 60-90 minute wait for a table downstairs, but perhaps that is my fault for not getting us there earlier than 7pm on Friday night.\n\nFood is good, but not 5 star food.  Better than your average pub grub, but this is not your average pub.  They specialize in their mussels and frites, both of which were good, not great.  The prices for mussels are standard for North Beach restaurants and I expected a little more flavor in them.  Frites were good, but after my trip to NYC and craving Pommes Frites in East Village and dining on them at 3am....I haven't found anywhere that stood up to that 5 star mouthful.\n\nBeers (Belgian ales), the beer list, the awesome basement ambiance, and decent mussels make this a place I will visit again with more buddies.", "author": "Chris C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-16", "description": "I wasn't overly impressed with La Trappe.   The Belgian Beer Selection is quite impressive, but the the \"on tap\" beer sizes vary and most selections are only offered in a single size.  I am used to being able to order any beer in 2 or 3 sizes when in Belgium.  For the most part I thought the Beer was overpriced (at least the beer that you can find at other establishments around town).  I tried a few different beers with my meal which I ate in the cellar. \n\nThe food did not knock my socks off.  The \"grass fed\" burger was nothing to write home about... I didn't even finish it despite being hungry.  The fries were delicious, but not worth making a trip back for, I would probably head to Frjtz if that was what I was craving (they have more dipping sauces). My companion had mussels and fries which were served in a huge pot  filled above the brim, but they did not match the mussels I had a day earlier in Belden Alley, although there were more of them.\n\nThe round table for two was so tiny that our food and drinks were fighting for places to sit and helped to make the place feel even more cramped than it already was.  We asked if we could move to a slightly larger empty table when the food arrived, but were told someone was waiting for it.   It sat empty until just before we finished our meal. The noise level was incredible.  It was very hard to communicate and be heard despite there being a few empty tables while we were dining.  \n\nI might come back here for beer and appetizers if I planned on sitting at the bar or if I had friends who wanted to drink Belgian beers in North Beach.  However, I don't think it is worth going out of your way to eat or drink here. It is very small, so not great for large groups.  The noise level due to the low ceiling prevents it from being cozy.

I'll take it! \n\nA couple of weeks ago some friends and I began a Belgian brew tour of the greater Bay Area, and we may have found our Shangri-La at La Trappe in North Beach. It looks small and unassuming from the outside- a corner restaurant with a few tables and chairs- but enter and descend the staircase and you'll find yourself in a spacious yet cozy underground bar, with tables for food service and a lounge in back tricked out with cushy booths. You'll also find lots of premium Trappist brews both on tap and by the bottle. \n\nIt is wise to exercise caution (or at least awareness) when you're doing it Belgian style. La Trappe lists the alcohol content of each beer on their menu to help keep you informed of how much of a punch you're getting in those innocuous looking chalices. Leaving this bar sober is unlikely at best. Luckily, you're a hop skip and a jump from Cinecitta so you can suck down some awesome pizza to help soak up the alcohol.", "author": "Angie R."}

A small group of us (4) arrived for a friend's birthday - a group that would grow to about 8-9 people eventually.  First we were disappointed to see no food served until 6 pm (it was 3:30 on a Saturday).  Someone asked if they could get food and bring it so that we could stay together.  They were told no.  (Our group was split on whether this should have been allowed.)  \n\nUpon arrival, I stood away from the 3 others and ordered my first round - a diet coke and a beer for the birthday boy.  I started to pay with cash and the bartender asked me if I wanted to start a tab.  Wanting to save my cash for parking I said sure.  45 min later I went up and ordered another diet coke and a second beer for my friend.  Another in my group was at the bar and the bartender asked him his first name to make sure and charge the right card.  I then gave my name so my order would be charged to the right card.  30 min later I went to cash out and received a bill for $43!!  The bartender had put 5 beers on my card that I had not ordered.  I asked him how that had happened and he said that HE had asked people I was sitting with if he should put their drinks on \"THE tab.\"  Problem was those people had left to get their food so I couldn't even collect money from them.  I asked that he change the charge and he refused.  \n\nI have NEVER been to a bar where the bartender would allow someone to charge to a tab without making sure it was authorized by the cardholder.  NEVER.  In fact, in this case, he had volunteered my card to others, which I find even more despicable.  He should have reversed my charges and approached the table to either get cash or another card.  \n\nI have written the owner requesting a refund - we'll see what he does.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

The ordeal took 3 hours which was beyond ridiculous and can be boiled down to bad timing and a poor server.   The downstairs was moderately busy,  but everyone seemingly arrived at once.  Our server,  1 of 2, was quirky and just out of it.   We arrived at 7:30, did not receive drinks until 8:30.  Nor did our server return  to retrieve our dinner orders during this time.   Ordered dinner at 8:30, just after 9, he returned to ask if it was a half dozen or two dozen oysters.   Five minutes after,  he returned to advise the kitchen had notified him they were out of scallops.   It was at this point we determined that he had just put the order in,  and it was also at this point the other server,  possibly the owner? Noticed our situation and took over our table along with the bartender.   They tried their best to make up for the issues.  We did not ask for compensation, but they took it upon  themselves to take 1 dozen oysters off the bill,  and all of our drinks which included 3 beers,  1 glass of wine and 1 bottle of wine.  The food itself,  OK.   Lastly,  we never received one of the appetizers we ordered,  nor was it on the bill.   Must have forgotten about it in the 45 minutes he took to put our order in the system.   Sadly,  I would try this place once more as the tables around us seemed to have reasonable service time,  the downstairs ambiance is cool (although music would be nice),  and they have an extensive beer selection.  One last note,  upon leaving we noticed an application for new ownership transfer in the window dated 9/30/13.

The list is so extensive, its hard to know where to begin, but fortunately the bartenders are really nice to let you sample as many as you want (it seems) before deciding on a refreshing glass. Mmmm.... Belgian beer.\n\nIf its good food and attentive service you're after, venture elsewhere. The experience of La Trappe was killed the moment we were seated for dinner. Though we didn't have to wait for a table, we sure as hell waited a long time our waiter to take notice of us. After we got our menus, we decided on three appetizers. We told our waiter we'd like to order them, then take a little more time to decide on entres. Instead of checking back after 5, 10, hell even 15 minutes, we notified a bus boy after sitting idly for 20 minutes that we were ready to put in our mains. All he could respond with was \"ask waiter.\" I asked if he could please get our waiter, as he was nowhere in sight, but all he could respond with again was \"ask waiter.\" Finally, our waiter made it back to our table. He asked if we could use more drinks in the meantime and we asked for recommendations. After my friend decided on an ale, I decided to try a sample of the same beer. 10 minutes later the beer came, but the waiter forgot my sample and had to go back for it...another 5 minute wait.\n\nAfter waiting nearly 40 minutes, our appetizers came. I can't imagine it takes that long to throw some frites in a basket, but perhaps it was the mussels and the mushroom polenta dishes that did it. For 40 minutes, I was hoping these would be outstanding dishes. Well, what do the 2 stars tell you? \n\n*The Frites: how can one be expected to dip fries into a sauce if they are the length of your pinky fingernail? Its impossible! The curry ketchup sauce was pretty good, though the curry sauce at Frjtz in the mission is better and comes with fries that can actually be dipped without a fork!\n\n*The mussels: are apparently steamed in a beer sauce, but you wouldn't know it because they completely lack in any flavor. And the onions they're served with are thin and few.\n\n*Portabella mushroom on polenta: this was the best appetizer, with polenta not too fried or soggy.\n\nWe were 5 people, and considering we were clearly sharing the the starters, it would have been nice if they'd considered giving us plates that were a little bigger than a teacup saucer so we didn't have to keep passing the food around in circles, trying to cut and serve it up without knocking each others elbows and drink glasses. \n\nAbout a half hour after getting our appetizers we got our mains. I got the cod gratin with salad, two people got the rabbit stew, and two others got the moules frittes to share.\n\n*Cod gratin: getting to sample the others' dishes, I concluded this was the best dish. It was cooked in a decent beschamel sauce and not overly cheesy. The side salad, however, was just a few pieces of lettuce with some red vinaigrette. If you get yourself this dish, ask to substitute the salad with veggies. The veggies that came with the rabbit were far better than the salad, though a little bit overcooked.\n\nOur waiter did not once come to check on us while we were eating, and only offered to bring us the check after we asked our waiter to please get him (again, \"ask waiter\"). \n\nI was totally unimpressed by the food and would never want to deal with the wait staff again.

I'll spare the details, but let's just say I would be more forgiving if the mains weren't going for $21 each - I know that isn't Gary Danko prices, but I would expect that at those prices, I had a right to some sort of service.\n\nThe food ranged from pretty good rabbit stew to inedible gnocchi.  My husband ordered it and ate it, but it was scary - little balls of flour in a cheese soup.  I swore he would be moaning with stomach pain by the end of the night.  The sliders were overcooked - kind of like little burned meat pucks.  But you put enough ketchup on anything and yay, tasty delight!\n\nBut...the beer!  It rocks!  I lived in Brussels for a while, and this really reminds me of my favorite place there.  A review with a happy ending!  Great selection and they are pouring them in their proper glasses - how  cool!  Really great atmosphere too.  I am looking forward to going back and ordering beers at the bar.  Hopefully they will hire some more help.", "author": "Melissa G."}

Overall the place feels welcoming.  Clientele was mostly 20-something and a few older folks (50+); we were the only 30-somethings I noticed.  Amazing selection of beers (average $9-11).  Bartender was helpful and friendly.  \n\nThe 8 if us decided to have dinner and I connected with the SOLITARY server in the downstairs dining area to let him know we'd like a table.  He was nice, and we had a table within 15 minutes.  \n\nAfter we were seated almost 25 minutes went by and we still hadn't had the opportunity to order anything (we wanted food and BEERS!).  Our server was taking/delivering orders elsewhere and never looked our way.  Finally, we told a busboy we'd like to order.  Then we saw our server run upstairs, and we waited some more.  Then we told another busboy we'd like to order.  And we waited some more.  That's right, folks, until someone with a brain and some authority sent down reinforcement around 9:15 on a Saturday night, one server was all alone with approx. 10 full tables of 35 customers!!  Finally a girl came down from upstairs and took our drink/food order (no less than 40 min. after were were seated).  While she was at our table the other male server gave me an apologetic look from across the room and mouthed \"sorry.\"  Sure, it's okay dude . . . don't mind us.  I know you're busy.  \n\nBeers took at least 15 minutes more of waiting.  We were very happy to finally have something to drink (having been seated for almost an hour)!  Then we waited for our food, which took another 20 minutes. \n\nFood -  Panchetta on the prawn appitizer was burnt - so black it looked and tasted like charcoal (ick!), calamari salads were very bland and lacked any distinct flavor, burger was average, fries were fine, portobello burgers were so salty that's all you could taste. \n\nAfter our table was cleared by the hardworking busboys we waited about 20 minutes for the check until one of us waved his hand and our server came over and we asked for our check.  She nodded and went away.  We waited about 10 minutes.  Check didn't come.  We saw the male server and asked him.  He went away.  We waited another 5 minutes or so before we signaled to him across the room.  Finally he came over with the check and my friend's boyfriend said (very loudly) \"Alright! The check!\"  Sure, it was pretty obnoxious, but heck . . . we were genuinely thrilled to finally have the check . . . could we be blamed!?  So, here's the icing on the cake - the male server (remember the nice guy who was all alone down there and got us the table right away?), looks down and away from my friend's boyfriend with a face twisted with anger and mouths \"Fuck you.\"  WTF????  \n\nYou know, I truly felt his pain and don't blame him for being at the end of his rope, but he needs to tell the managers/owners of this train wreck of a restaurant \"fuck you,\" not us!!!  For the amount of money they charge for beer, I can't believe they can't afford more than one server for 10 tables, 8-9PM on a Saturday night!  \n\nOn our way out a group of young guys were apprehensively heading in.  We jokingly warned them to get ready to lay down some cash and advised them NOT to order any food.  During this exchange a guy came out of the restaurant, sarcastically yelled at us \"yeah, thanks for your honesty,\" and appeared to go around the corner and into a side door.   Ummm. . . . so we're not supposed to tell other people about our negative experience!?  Sorry La Trappe, that comes with the territory.\n\nIn summary, without a doubt I would absolutely never go back to this place.  I don't know the real story, but La Trappe feels like it's run by a bunch of trust fund frat guys who came up with a great idea during a late night of beer pong and who know nothing about running a restaurant.

Burger, mini burgers and salads - very tasty, reasonably priced.

This place is kinda upside down with a small dinning room and kitchen when you walk in and a very cool restaurant, bar and lounge downstairs. I can't imagine anyone wanting to sit upstairs unless downstairs was packed. Just a dull, empty room with no atmosphere. Why were asked if we wanted to sit there? Why not make this room more inviting with a bar and set up more like a lounge area so you'd want to hangout there. Second, we saw a sign in the bar downstairs that said happy hour 3-6.

The initial reason why we decided upon La Trappe was the beer selection.  But surprisingly the food was absolutely top notch.  Upon entering the restaurant we made our way down a spiral stair case to the basement bar and dining area.  The brick arches and water fountains gave this lower level an intimate speak easy type atmosphere.  It was both warm and inviting.  Once seated our servers were attentive, knowledgeable and prompt.  We each were recommended some draft beers that were to our individual liking and were given plenty of time to look over the menu.  I asked the server what he liked best.  I was told \"Mussels, steak and burgers\".  At first, that is pretty much all that I saw on the menu and that had me worried that the food was going to be poor quality red meat prepared by nuking with little attention to detail.  Was I wrong in a good way! The steaks were cooked perfectly and served rare/medium rare per order.  The burgers were perfectly seasoned and never robbed of moisture during the grilling process.  The fries that came with the burger and steaks were blanched and had the perfect color and crunch.  A friend I was with got an order of the mash potatoes with bacon and the consistency was perfect.  They were whipped but still held together well from the bacon fat.  In all, I strongly recommend La Trappe as a dinner and drinking spot.

Downstairs is where all the magic happens. You'll find a cozy dining area that plays audience to a centrally located bar. They can handle reasonably sized parties (around 6-7 to a table) but any larger than that and you'll be split up. \n\nOf all the food we ordered, the fries and mussels stood out. These days, fries are often an afterthought, filler if you will...not at La Trappe. They're served with a dipping sauce that simply rocks...each plate didn't last but for a few minutes at our table...and by the night's end, we'd had ordered 4 or 5. Thinly sliced, with potato flavor that stands up to the light frying, it sounds trivial, but they're damn good fries! Their mussels come in a big bucket you could wear as a helmet...'nuff said! \n\nLast but not least is the beer...they have a HUGE selection of Belgian beer and if you don't know where to begin, just ask your server. Our server for the evening was very friendly and gave some excellent recommendations. While friendly and helpful, he was only 1 of 2 servers for the night, which meant we were waiting awhile between orders. Overall, the food was good, the beers awesome, and the vibe awesome. Try to make reservations ahead of time because the place gets packed on Fridays and Saturdays.", "author": "Eric N."}

We were meeting friends and upon arriving and entering the restaurant we were a little leery...there was NO ONE in the place (or so we thought).  One of the wait staff told us to head downstairs; and what a surprise!  A nice, cozy, dark, intimate, stone walled oasis filled with other diners.  Totally different from the empty, stark interior upstairs.  (I can see foot traffic being turned off by what seems like an empty restaurant so I hope it gets the business it needs to stick around.)  We sat at a nice big wooden booth that would be great for a party as large as 6 and had a great time.

My husband was hoping to find Leffe on tap and low and behold... there it was. They had Chimay, Leffe, Alfigen, Hoegaarden and about 15 other beers on tap. Plus, they had pages and pages of beers on a menu that you could order. It was very, very impressive. The bartender, John explained to us that yesterday 12/21 was their first day opening to the public. The ambience was great, the bartender offered us several different beers to taste and we had a really enjoyable time. This bar is only a few blocks away, so, we are really excited. I've been searching for a place to have good Belgian beer. I don't think any place in San Francisco compares to the selection at La Trappe.\n\nWe had 2 glasses of Leffe, and Affligen and an order of Frites ($5) for a total of $22. I think that is a pretty good deal seeing as most places will sell you a glass of Chimay for about $7.  We did not have dinner here yet, but, we will be returning in the next week or so.\n\nIf you love Belgian beer, this is worth the trip. They are open to the public now... really!", "author": "Joan L."}

Sat there with menu's and some empty glasses for about 15 minutes.  Finally, we flagged a waitress and said we were ready.  She was like, oh, no one has waited on you.  Takes forever to get a beer. \n \nFood - Burger was good.  Fries were good.  Moules a la Biere was good.  Steak, eh.  Gnocchi, YUCK!  Undercooked pieces of raw dough.  We first thought, maybe there was some type of cheesy filling.  But not really.  \n\nOverall, it seems like many of the employees are in constant motion, but not getting too much accomplished.  The bussers are very efficient, though.\n\n************************\n\nMy husband made reservations for us on Valentine's Day.  I greatly dislike going out on Valentine's Day, as you're usually surrounded by starry-eyed couples who make me want to throw-up.  We're not old, but the last time we dined out on Valentine's Day was in 2000, when we just started started dating.  So, I was very apprehensive about going out.  \n\nMy husband chose this place, as I LOVE french fries and Belgian beer.  Unfortunately, even through he called in the reservation on Monday, no one mentioned to him that the regular menu would not be available.  Luckily, we found this out on Wednesday when I went to peruse the menu and saw only the set-price four course dinner was the only option available for $60/person.  So, we were not taken-aback when we were seated on Thursday (as some other couples obviously were).\n\nWhen the hostess gave us the menus, she said for $20 more, one could get the suggested beer pairings with each course.   My husband said, so like, 4-6 ounce tastings, and she confirmed yes.  \n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the moules a la biere and the artisanal cheese plate.  Both were huge servings and extremely tasty.  When we received our beer, we were surprised that the specialty glasses were full.  Having not quite finished the complementary glass of prosecco and realizing that we'd be getting four beers each, I said this is going to be a long night.  \n\nLong story short, the experience at La Trappe was wonderful.  Great beer: an extensive list of Belgian and Belgian style beers from around the world (though they are missing the Corsendonk Brown); and great food: huge servings, excellent flavors (we had, in addition to the above-mentioned appetizers, Cream of Ginger Carrot Soup, Harvest Salad with Roquefort toast, the filet with potatoes au gratin and green beans, Ricotta and Spinach Ravioloni, and for dessert, the Chocolate Ganache and Creme Brulee).  \n\nThe service in my opinion was good.   Perhaps it was because we were experiencing a differently paced meal.  But our server was friendly and the busser always kept our water glasses full and cleared our plates.  \n\nThe atmosphere was nice.  It seemed a little off the beaten path of North Beach establishments, so it looked pretty free of touristy type people.  All the tap handles for the different Belgians certainly doesn't detract :-)\n\nWe will definitely be returning.  Hopefully so I can sample some of the frites.  But the extensive list of Belgian beers is enough to draw us back.", "author": "Jory R."}

This seemed strange, since the bar was very loud and rather casual, and it seems it would make sense to offer diners the option of eating in the more romantic and peaceful restaurant if that is their preference.\n\nOnce seated, we ordered beers.  I like beer more than most people like anything, and La Trappe definitely deserves recognition for their extensive, varied, and detailed menu of Belgian and Belgian-style beers on tap.  I tried three, and while I didn't find any of them to be phenomenal, sometimes that's just the way it goes when you're trying new beers.\n\nLa Trappe has a mouth-watering menu of European-inspired cuisine.  I'm always looking for bars with a great list of draft beer, and decent food, so any beer bar that goes beyond wings, sliders, and nachos earns points with me.  We awaited our mussels, steak, and chicken stew with great anticipation, and unfortunately were generally disappointed in all of it.  The mussels did not taste very fresh, and the beer and cheese preparation was not very good.  Both the steak and the chicken stew were bland, and while the steak was enjoyable once I tossed some salt on it, the chicken stew really had no redeeming qualities.  The fries, which so many people had raved about, tasted rather ordinary, but the Belgian and chipotle mayonnaises were quite tasty.\n\nOverall, I appreciate La Trappe's effort to be a beer bar with real food, but I do not think i would choose to eat here again.", "author": "Megan S."}

This is the third time I've been to Le Trappe and each successive trip is worse than the last.  Tonight we sat and waited for a table for 40 minutes, only to be told once we finally sat down that the restaurant had enough mussels left for one order.  The mussels are one of four or five entrees on the menu and quite honestly the only reason to dine here in the first place.  Well, we've already waited 40 minutes, it's too late to leave and go wait to sit somewhere else, so we decide to stay.  We order a few beers, which arrive a good 10 minutes after our mussels get there and it turns out that the last order of mussels is actually only a half order.  Oops.  We order our dinners.  Three steaks, all medium rare and one hamburger, well done.  The waiter informs the hamburger orderer that the well done burgers tend to have the consistency of a hockey puck and strongly suggests going medium well, to which the orderer agrees.  The food comes and of course the hamburger is medium rare, nowhere even close to medium well.  It gets sent back and doesn't return for a good 15 minutes.  The steaks are absolutely without flavor and mine appears to maybe have taken a brief look at the grill, but moos at me when I cut into it for the first bite.  Medium rare steak is not purple in the middle and does not require you to chew it for 5 minutes in order to swallow a bite.  All these screwups and they still have the nerve to charge an extra $1.50 for the cheese on the undercooked burger.  All the aforementioned issues are mentioned to the manager and his only response is to say that they fixed the burger and to question why I \"finished my meal\" if the steak was underdone.  I took three bites of it.  The manager refuses to do anything with our bill and says that it's ok when we inform him that we will not be back.  To have the manager activities  extremely rude after everything that already happened was just adding insult to injury.  Dine at your own risk.

So good as a bar, and a horrible mistake to try to cook anything.\n\nMy recommendation: if you want good mossels, go to Frjtz on Valencia St.  Don't waste any penny in this Trappe.", "author": "Pierre S."}

I myself have never been much of a beer connoisseur, but I liked Stella and that was Belgian, right?! ;-)\n\nWe walked in and the upstairs was practically empty...I wondered where everyone was...it was a Friday night after all.  Had this place lost it's shininess after only a few months?  Non, non, non!  The people were below!  We were directed to go downstairs where I was told that this was a traditional Belgian Beer \"Cave\"...who knew that they had beer caves?  I was under the impression that the only things made or grown in caves were wine, mushrooms or bats!  But apparently the Belgians have their own way of doing things.  \n\nWe walk up to the crowded bar to grab a menu and the waitress hands us this five pound tome of beers.  How do you choose a beer when you have 35 pages of choices?!  Luckily Andrei Z. was there to help Gene X. and I out as it was our maiden voyage at La Trappe.  He made great suggestions based on what we liked.  We sat down in their lounge area since we weren't there to eat.  It's a comfortable open space of cushioned benches....it's quite dark down there and even I was struggling to read the menu in the light....however I didn't do what the 50ish year old gentleman across from me did...he used the candle to read the menu.  Youthful eyesight prevails!  Speaking of youthful, I got carded both times I went up to the bar.  Yes, they were different bartenders but still....I was flattered the first time, annoyed the second time.  Do they really get that many under age drinkers in that place?!  Somehow I doubt it.\n\nOverall I think this is a great location, great idea and they've managed to do it quite well.  The beers are on the pricier side though, so don't expect to go in for some sort of happy hour.  I think the majority of beers are in the $8-12 range and if you're buying a large bottle they can be in the $22-34 range.  That being said, if you're a fan of good Belgian beer, you're probably okay with spending that kind of money.", "author": "Melanie N."}

My guests and I sat with a board member, Jeri B.  Our dinner was set for 7:00 pm.  The appetizers  were ceviche (calamari, veggies resting on an endive leaf) and Fresh shucked oysters.  It was a long stretch between the salad or soup (minestrone) to the main entree.  As noted in previous reviews, probably due to new opening jitters.  The salad was excellent (spinach, radicchio, walnuts, and apples (thinly sliced).  They were great at making sure we were well stocked with water, drinks of our choice, and bread (baskets and more baskets).  My guests and I had their very tender pork chops (steak size) cooked in Belgian Beer!  Jeri B. had the Monk Fish.  The people on the next table had the impressive Belgian mussels and frittes.  They gave me a sample of their mussels.  Huge pots - about 3 dozens!  I spied the one half of roasted chicken, risotto, and gnocchi.  We came away happy and content.  We were given the choice of cheese cake or chocolate tart ( we had the latter).  I am not much of a dessert freak so from the looks of one of my guests, he inhaled the chocolate tart.  \n\nI was amazed that they had only two wait staff and 3 bus boys for 70 people.  The music they \"channeled\" was inconsistent  and hopefully they will have better selections.  \n\nMy family used to dine quite frequently when it was Bucco Giovanni, so I was impressed with the newly renovated interior on the top floors (kitchen, seating for 8) and the stairways down to the main dining area which still had the original brick facade (similar to Cafe du Nord), and the rest rooms are totally well designed.\n\nMy guest and I decided to give La Trappe some time before returning soon, but we will definitely put our chops on the mussels and Belgian Fries.  \n\nThe Signature Entrees are excellent.  Give this establishment a few months to work out the kinks and they are off and running.", "author": "Marian G."}

I would give them five stars out of the gate, but even opening-night jitters cannot explain the disappearance of our waitress for nearly an hour, while we sat with an empty, yet formerly delicious, cheese plate and utterly beerless. When we did see her, it was to hear that yet another beer we ordered could not be located or had not arrived in their stock yet. All of this would have been entirely forgivable had she not abandoned us without so much as a panicked smile and a \"I haven't forgotten you, it's just my hair's on fire\" look. But as sweet and lovely as she was when she did materialize, her frequent and prolonged absences were frustrating. \n\nThat's the bad news. Everything else was fabulous. The basement dining room and bar area was beautiful and transportive--you felt like you really were quaffing fine ales in the basement of a monastery in a tiny town in Belgium. The beer list is truly phenomenal. Even my brewmaster, beer geek boyfriend was struck speechless by its breadth and length--and the shear number of beers never before (or rarely) seen on these shores. The food menu was an exercise in enticing simplicity. We only sampled the amazing cheese and pate platter, but I will eagerly return for a more complete meal. \n\nAnd once we moved our tab to the bar, everything was wonderful. The bartender, clearly overwrought, but thrilled with the beer and the business, was attentive and friendly and funny. The crowd was very local, which was refreshing for a Saturday night in North Beach. \n\nI anticipate many lovely hours spent in this very welcome and welcoming place.", "author": "Sage R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-13", "description": "I am definitely a fan of La Trappe, and would come back for another round. This was my choice when The Boy came up to SF for a dinner date. He just wanted something laid-back with tasty food. I knew that he liked beer, and wanted some place quiet-ish for us to relax and chat while we ate dinner as well. La Trappe has over 200 different types of bottled beer, and about 30 on tap. They do serve wine as well, but that seems rather, well...stupid. \n\nWe walked in, and noticed about six tables upstairs, and asked if we could go and seat ourselves downstairs. You walk down, and are in this cozy warm lit space that has a bar, several tables set up, and a back space that was being used for what looked like a little party going on. We decided to sit at the bar, as there were 2 seats next to each other on the end, and it was obvious that no tables were going to free up anytime soon in the larger space. We were almost snuggled up right under the stairs, and we were quickly handed the beer book and their 1 page menu after being greeted by one of the beermen. I was totally overwhelmed by the list, and The Boy seemed pretty impressed as well. \nI actually managed to wade through a bit of the beer book and select something, and we ordered the sliders as a starter. My suggestion? Get the sliders. You can thank me later.\n\nThe beer man that helped us was so wonderful at giving us some of his time (as it quickly became PACKED within 15 minutes of us sitting down) in explaining the different kinds of beer, why they cleaned certain glasses and not others, and the types of glassware that they used at the bar. He did check in with us from time to time, but not so often that we felt smothered. I ordered the mussels and frites, and The Boy ordered the black cod. My food came pretty quickly, and as we sat and waited for his food (and nibbled at my fries), they realized that the fish order hadn't gone in, and quickly put it in with their apologies. No worries, we said, and they got that order down to us in lightening time. We ordered 2 more beers at this point, and the one The Boy picked the beerman said had a very distinct, almost sour taste, and let him taste it (since it was on tap), and let him choose something else to finish off his meal with. \n\nWhile obviously, this place is about the Beer, the food is certainly not to be missed. My mussels (which I ordered in the Mariniere style), were of a generous portion, and the fries were hot and crisp and consistant in size and style. They were also well seasoned - where they were not too salty, nor did they need any additional work should you so desire to eat them plain. They also come with 2 of their dips. The Black Cod (which is now off the menu, sucks to be you) was served with some potatoes and veggies, and was cooked pretty much to perfection; I remember it being moist and fresh seafood flavorful. It really was high end pub style food. \n\nWhile it did get busy, it never seemed like I was shouting at The Boy  in order to have a conversation with him, though we did have to cozy up to each other at the bar to let other people get in and order. When we asked for the bill, our beerman has comped one of our rounds of beer since we had to wait for the fish (which was almost the price of the dish anyways). They quickly processed our order, and we got out the door for a very reasonable dinner about for the amount of food and drink we consumed. \n\nKeep in mind that the beer here is not cheap - you won't be getting any $5 PBR. Be nice, be patient, and enjoy. I am excited to bring people back.", "author": "Jessica S."}

After reading some of the reviews about shoddy, unwelcoming service, I was reluctant to give LA Trappe a shot. However, my partner and I were desperate for a good burger and beer and inevitably said 'what the hell.'  \nI couldn't be happier that we decided to stop in for a few. The basement is insane, and that's a good thing. The feel of the downstairs dining room is somewhere in between a wine cellar and an old European gastropub. The real highlight, though, is the Beer Bible. The list of beers, both bottle and draught, is so lengthy the Bible requires a table of contents. And if you're feeling overwhelmed, no need to fear, the attentive servers are extremely knowledgeable and will undoubtedly steer you in the right direction.

That said, I do not believe that their friendship prevents me from being able to review this place  honestly.  I have only met Mike a few times, all as he was working on turning this space from the old shell of Buca Giovanni into what is now La Trappe.  As you can see from my numbers, I have been doing some serious Yelping and this is not one of those reviews from someone's Mom/aunt/best friend who just created an account to review their new place. Now on to my review. . .\n\nAfter many months of waiting, we were very excited to finally check out La Trappe on their opening night.  Having seen the space when it was completely gutted and totally under construction, I can say that it has come a long way!  It is absolutely beautiful inside.  The upstairs is a warm, inviting dining area with terracotta colored walls.  On such a cold night, it was a very comforting color choice!  A very sturdy wrought iron staircase leads downstairs to the bar area, where there is also additional seating for drinking/dining.  WOW.  The downstairs area is cool.  We actually sat upstairs on this visit and then cruised downstairs to check it out. OH MY GOD.  The back corner is like a fabulous little drinking cave.  Now I know when you hear cave, you think BATS or OSAMA BIN LADEN, but I am telling you - this is so freaking cool.  Next time we are totally cozying up in the cave.  Trust me, check out both the upstairs and the downstairs before deciding where you want to settle down.  The downstairs was definitely louder, but you have got to see it!  While you are down there, make sure to pay attention to the beautiful wood that is the bar itself.  It is one piece of wood and just gorgeous.  I was seeing the edge of it from upstairs and drawn downstairs to take it all in.\n\nNow, for the beer.  They have a bottled beer list that is 4 pages long.  I believe that almost all of those beers are Belgian, with only a few exceptions.  They also have 9 Belgian beers on tap.  My fiance had the Delirium Tremens on tap and the bottled Cherish Raspberry.  (I had my neurologist in my head telling me to stay off the beer and on my epilepsy medicine.)  It would take you a long time to get through all of the beers on the beer list.  You could go many weeks, even as a heavy drinker, without having the same one twice.\n\nFoodwise, I decided to make a meal of sides.  So I had mixed vegetables, polenta, mashed potatoes, & frittes.  My fiance had the potato leek soup, the chicken dish, & frittes.  Everything was very tasty and the portions were definitely ample.  The portions were so ample in fact that we never even made it to the dessert menu.  :(  Next time!  I can't really comment on whether or not the Belgian-style dishes are authentic or not.  I have never been to Belgium in my life, so I will readily admit to having no idea.\n\nService - There were definitely some opening night snags that were to be expected.  I was shocked to see how many people were there.  Not only was the place packed, but there was a wait (for upstairs dining) the entire time we were there.  The staff definitely had the opening night jitters, but I don't think that there are any problems that won't work themselves out over time.\n\nOverall - La Trappe is a great addition to the neighborhood.  It is so nice not to have another Italian restaurant.  We look forward to coming back again and spending some quality time in the cave.", "author": "Squirrel L."}

Twenty minutes later there's no sign of a table, so we go ahead and order some apps.  30 minutes later there's no sign of a table or our apps :( we manage to flag down the waitress that took our order and ask her how long our table be - her response is \"they ordered dessert\" she shrugs and walks off.....OhKay, maybe ten minutes later we manage to flag her down again and ask after our apps...and are told \"the kitchen is working on them\"  We just ordered fries and salads for apps.  Finally one person goes to cancel the food order only to be told its on the way out....And they do come straight away with our fries.  Twenty minutes later our salad followed.

I ended up with a really good wheat beer and a thirst for all the rest of them he let me try (this place could be very dangerous for my credit card!).\nMy friends got a bottle of wine which they were impressed with, and from the few sips I stole so was I.

I don't like beer (I know, weird)...and it's not that I haven't tried enough. I have worked in 5 restaurants and bars over the years, as a server, cocktail waitress, beverage cart driver, and bartender. So I've had plenty of opportunities to try my share of beer over the years...never liked any. Anyway, that was my disclaimer...now back to the review. \n\nSo this place doesn't seem like it would be as amazing as it actually is from the outside, or even walking in the front door. The good times to be had are downstairs. Yes, there is a downstairs that a lot of people might not know about. It used to be a speakeasy, so it has a cave feel to it, with a waterfall and plenty of tables and booths, great for just hanging out with friends or a date. Mike, the bartender/owner was beyond helpful and attentive to us and here's the highlight...HE FOUND 2 BEERS THAT I LOVED. Mike hit the spot (sicko, not like that)! The first was the kasteel rouge, and it tasted like cherry soda. The second, and my favorite was the framboise raspberry lambic, and it tasted like a raspberry cider. It was delicious. Each beer comes with it's own glass, unique to that beer. Neat, huh? \nIf you're looking to check out new craft beers or just love a good Belgian beer, this is the place.", "author": "Julie F."}

I can see it being fun to order everything over the course of time just to check out the glasses). \n\nWe were inspired to discuss international beer experiences. Terry's was the best; at about 20, she spent 3 days in Brussels sitting in the youth hostel drinking dollar beers w/o ever going outside. \n\nSomeone mentioned how Tommy's Joynt doesn't really have all the beers they profess to have, and within minutes the waiter returned to our table to say they did not have the beer I ordered, a Val-Dieu Grand Cru, \"Dark Ale with chocolate and port wine overtones, Deep dark color is oily and spicy with aroma of roasted malt and chocolate finishes slightly dry. \" So then I chose the Duchesse De Bourgogne \"Matured in oak casks blended 8 and 18 months-refreshing and smooth iwth interplay of fruit and chocolate - long dry and acidic finish. After 2 years in the barrrel, Iris goes through another hopping process for two weeks making it smell and taste more bitter.\" But he steered me away from that for a reason I can't recall, and in the end suggested the Gulden Draak, \"Thick beer malt toffee like sweetness with a mellow happiness and some hoppy accents, like a barley wine. It's to sip and enjoy.\" I did like this last one a lot - it was just what I was wanting and the waiter seemed to understand that.\n\nIt was someone's birthday so we ordered the belgian waffles with beer sauce and a chocolate trifle, all of which were really good.

Hidden down in a tiny sweat box basement you will find one of San Francisco's gems of beer selection. Actually, let me rephrase that. You will find San Francisco's most important beer gem that provides us humans with the highest and most premier quality beer from around the world. La Trappe carries hundreds of beers traveling many oceans and continents from all over the world. Specializing in Belgian style beers, La Trappe also offers almost every trappist style beer one could have. There are a couple trappist breweries that do not allow their product to leave their country. If I recall, Kwak being one of them. The two boys running the ship, Mike Moore and Mike Azzalinni, provide their friends and customers with the most reasonable prices in the bay area and support many local beer events, such as strong beer month. They also have teamed up with a local butcher creating awesome culinary events, one of which was a breakdown of a pig and serving it many different ways. Not to forget of course to have a beer pairing with every course. These boys know their stuff, and I encourage you to stop by and have a beer with them.

The trip started off well enough as we made our way downstairs to the cellar-type dining room and settled into a small table for two.  After that, things were just so-so.  The service was pretty slow, but friendly enough when they were around.  We ordered our apps and entrees and some beers.  The potato leek soup was ok flavor wise, but it was only lukewarm, which didn't help matters.  We had some oysters on the half shell which were actually quite good.  My husband had the burger, which he said was pretty good. I had the Moules Frites in the white beer broth, the entree portion.  It was enormous - so I'll give them credit for that, but I wish they had paid more attention to the quality than the quantity.  The broth was virtually flavorless and the mussels were unevenly cooked (some overdone, some fine).  But, really the biggest disappointment were the frites - I mean, this is your mainstay - they should be perfect!  Sadly, they were barely more than mediocre.  Each one should be perfectly crisp on the outside, unfortunately, only a few actually were.  Most were soggy and I ate only about 1/3 of the portion, very unusual for me as I'm a bit nuts for frites, normally.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, maybe it's like that all the time.

On the other hand,  they had a great selection of beer, but then again, failed to present them in the appropriate glass (this is oh so important to a Belgian!). The Trappist in Oakland does a much better job here. Finally, they overcharged us on all beers (1, 2 or even 4 (!) dollars on the Grimbergen). So double check your bill.

There were only a few Belgian food  items on the menu and everything was overpriced. 24 dollars for a steak and fries??? You pay that much and you expect your fries to be warm and at least to be served with mayonaise! \n\nThe beer list was great but the beer wasn't always served in the correct glass, which was disappointing. On top of that, we were overcharged for almost 10 bucks so keep your eyes on the bill and double check with the prices on the menu!

It has a crypt-like feel to it, featuring brick alcoves, and the bar set-up is perfect.\n\nAll in all, I'd go back to La Trappe for the beers if I happen to be in the city.

I can't speak to the food or the beer selection - after one glass of wine I was pretty ready to leave.  When my date and I arrived, the bar was not overly crowded so the waitstaff apparently had nothing to do but mill about behind the bar ignoring us.  It took quite some time to be given all the various menus (beer, food, wine), and then even longer to get a drink.  I made eye contact repeatedly with a waitress who could not be bothered to ask if I needed help.  Finally, I asked the bartender who I should speak with to order.  He rudely told me he would get to me when he wasn't busy.  I guess they didn't teach multitasking at his bartending school.

It's a belgian beer and food hall, with a cellar area and a bar that has a huge selection of beers.  That said, the service is terrible, the place is totally disorganized, and worst of all, the owner / bartender is absolutely awful.

So, we show up at 7:30 pm, and the place has two huge empty tables with \"reserved\" signs on them.  I ask the owner what the deal is (hello, I thought \"no reservations after 7 pm?!\") and he arrogantly and coldly tells me \"well, some times people can make reservations for later\" and then folds his arms and stands back behind the bar glaring at me.  What the heck!??  The owner (who also doubles as the bartender) was completely rude and arrogant, and made no attempt to accommodate at us at either of the huge empty tables, or at the rather large lounge area that was also totally empty (\"no, we won't serve food over there.\"), or anywhere else.  He said, \"You can wait an hour.\"  (For what!? There appeared to be no other customers ahead of us).   Um, ok (!?!?).   As we walked out the owner again glared at me the whole way up the stairs.  I'm sorry, but the guy was a jerk, and being the owner of a new place I don't think being rude and completely cold and unaccomodating to your patrons is any way to generate return traffic.

I didn't dine, having just gorged myself on dan-dan and chicken soup at Z & Y, but I'll have to return for the moules frites - they're the most interesting item on the menu (offered three ways) and nothing goes better with a Belgian ale.\n\nNo, I was here for the beer - and headed straight downstairs. Contrary to earlier reports the music was tasteful (Sonny Rollins) and played at a very reasonable level, so that I was able to carry on normal conversation with one of the owners, and a nice young French couple next to me. The cellar \"Trappist Lounge\" is suitably dark, decorated in stone and soft woods, and does a good job capturing the mood of a European beer cellar. As for the main event, I would rank this place on a par with The Trappist (and well ahead of Monk's Kettle) for the true Belgian beer geek. Outstanding selection - about a dozen on tap, and around a hundred more in bottle, including a number of seasonal Belgians and non-Belgian Euro offerings. All were priced more fairly than at MK, with very reasonable markups given the setting. While the tap list included what have become the usual suspects (Chimay White, Maredsous, etc.) there were a couple nice rarer options - Grimbergen, and a lovely white beer called Wittekerke that I hadn't had on tap and really loved (and according to the owner, Duvel may be available on tap in the States soon - we can only hope).  \n\nI asked the owners at all three places if any of them had a theory on why - after an eternity of virtually no Belgian-themed bars, the Bay Area got three new ones within a month. None of them, as it happens, had any notion of the others' existence basically until they were open. In short, a coincidence - except, of course, that SF has been woefully underserved in the premium beer arena and three groups had a good idea at about the same time. All nice people, but the (British) owner/bartender at La Trappe was exceptionally convivial and gregarious.

While the mussels look like they are going to be great, they are sadly mediocre. The mussels made with beer rather than white wine are especially tasteless.

It was high time this city had a refuge for Belgian beer and cuisine fans.  After one visit, some good and some bad:\n\nGOOD:  Two words: atmosphere and beer.  The downstairs \"cave\" reminded me of a true Belgian cafe.  Very convivial, non-stuffy, I could come here once a week and hang out.  The beer list is beyond outstanding.  They have Rodenbach on tap which blew me away and would keep me coming back for this alone and to delve deeper into the list.\n\nBAD:  the food was dissapointingly mediocre.  While I was excited to see some Belgian classics on the menu such as Waterzooi and an interesting rabbit dish, I opted for a first visit to go with the classic \"Moules Frites\" on which any Belgian establishment should be judged.  It was easily the worst mussels I have ever had anywhere on both continents.   They were small, shriveled and dried out and basically not even an edible dish.  In Belgium, there is definitely a \"mussel season\" and if you order them out of season  the waitstaff will kindly steer you away when they are not plump and juicy as they should be. I don't get the impression that level of care is taken here judging on what i was served.  Frites were decent but nothing to rave about.  They served a few mayo-based sauces as is tradition but the server was at a loss when i asked what they were.  The serviceable provencal sauce with pastis was mediocre and didn't incite you to lap it up with a spoon.  The shrimp croquettes, another classic, was well done and about double the portion size of what you would expect.  My guests both had Steakes-Frites and the steak looked like NY Strip from Safeway with an odd chunky vegetable saute that wasn't touched. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: I would come back here for some after-work beers but skip the food and go eat somewhere else until they get a handle on something as classic as  Moules Frites.", "author": "Peter L."}

For all of you who want a very large selection of Belgian and Belgian style (Japanese Belgian beers), this is your place. The downstairs cave, with the bar and the primary dining area, feels very warm and reminds me of Brugges. My husband looked longingly at the bar. No, they aren't open for lunch yet, much to my husband's regret. They were out of 3 of the 5 beers he ordered (hey, he only drank 2), but the selection is large enough to keep him very, very happy. Not as impressed with the wine selection, but it is a BEER house, so I'm not complaining, just informing you. My rabbit entree was delicious and my husband said that it went well with the beer, better than his fish entree. His beer had a pear note to it, so he drank that with the cheese plate and was very pleased. The chocolate mousse with raspberry reduction was excellent and belongs on the San Francisco Chocolate Trail (it's like Boston's Freedom Trail, but for chocolate), although the chocolate mousse at Le Petit Bistro in Mountain View is even better (world class).", "author": "Vena V."}

Walking along Columbus we almost passed it because we didn't see it because it's kinda a small place...initially. After getting in and going into the downstairs we soon found out it was a lot bigger than the eye sees. The ambiance and the environment was a lot of fun, though, they could use more light to read their menus. We had a lot of trouble with the book o beers(yes, they have a lot of beer there). So the main word of warning is that if the number to the right seems too high....that's the page number. The food was good and interesting and complemented the beer very well.", "author": "Mark M."}

It was definitely worth the wait.  The downstairs area is very cozy on a rainy night.  The number of Belgian beers is mind boggling, and it was very hard to choose which to order from all the great options.  For food, we shared a large cheese and pate plate that had an amazing duck sausage on it. We also had a huge pail of mussels and the harvest salad.  Our waiter was a bit overwhelmed with a very big group next to us, but he was still pretty attentive and friendly.  All in all, we're looking forward to going back, and we're so glad to have this new edition in the neighborhood.", "author": "Jen Y."}

Although the bartender admitted one beer of the 180 was not available that night. Very delicious beer. Downstairs bar area is fun. Little waterfall, euro bartenders, and wood beams. I felt transported somewhere in Burge. I learned the lie of the french fries. Apparently french fries came from Belgium. So of course we had Belgium fries and the dipping sauces we're delicious. So much to like in this neighborhood place. However, my fiance's brother's wife is Belgium. She ordered the white asparagus and a traditional Belgium dish. She said it was good and then said just okay. She wanted to love it.  We still love the place for the beer and the Belgium fries but not for the Belgium food.", "author": "Seymour S."}

The food is pretty good as well (though the portions could be a bit bigger). The best Belgian Waffle I've had outside of Brussels (and possibly the only authentic one I've had in North America). Overall a faithful representation of the sultry food and beer of Belgium, with an excellent location across from Washington Square Park. Guys, if you take a date here, I'll predict you go to bed with dessert.", "author": "Jeremy J."}
