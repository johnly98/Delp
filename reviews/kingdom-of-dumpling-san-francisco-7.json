I swear they must have paid someone to write their review on a foodie blog (which is how I found their place and therefore decided to try it out). The dumplings were not cooked properly and clearly made from frozen stock. We also tried the meat bun and it was soggy and flavorless. The tea they served hardly had any flavor at all. I strongly suspect they gave us yesterday's leftovers from the quality of the food.\n\nIn addition the wait staff is horrible and racist as a bunch of other reviews here have mentioned. There is a sign in sheet on the wall but the waiter does not respect it. There was one group that put their name on the list and was waiting patiently for their turn but other people came to the door and yelled that they were next in line so the server gave them the next spot. There was a Chinese family waiting outside and the waiter literally WOULD NOT LET THEM IN before they ordered even though  there were 2 empty tables in the restaurant. One of the family asked if they can order more later since they weren't ready and the waiter said in Chinese \"Why don't you breathe some more fresh air then\". We were inside, had menus and were allowed to order while seated at the table but this Chinese family needed to order outside in the cold? I was so apalled. Maybe it was cus my group had a Caucasian member?\n\nNeedless to say, me and my friends won't be coming back even though we live in the neighborhood based on food quality and most importantly on principle.", "author": "Rena S."}

Recently, I did a delivery from this place because I missed it (my friends and i used to come here every single week!). So this week I decided to stop by with my friends in person to get their food again.  However, the treatment from this place went downhill from my past visits.  \n\nLet me explain to you the issues we had here.  \n\nFirst, when we ordered our food, we asked specifically if we can order more later on in case it wasn't enough and the waiter said it was ok.  However, that wasn't the case!  When we wanted to order more again, the waiter said \"No!\" and didn't even give us an explanation and just walked away!   \n\nSecond- Aside from the attitude the waiter gave us, the food that day was horrible! The pan fried dumplings were horrible!  The ratio of the meat to the dough was like 3 to 1.  Since when did they become so stingy! I know things are expensive in California, but if you are going to be stingy with your items, you're going to lose some of your devoted customers!\n\nThird- This irks me the most.  We noticed that the waiter was super nice to the non-asian customers here. And the treated their Asian customers here with more attitude and no respect!  In the words of Eleanor from Crazy Rich Asians \"kaki lang\"  Why must your treat your Asian customers  with so much disrespect.  Show your \"kaki lang\" some respect! \n\nI used to come here every week back in the days, but now I can't even say when i'll be back ever again.

I had to ask 3 times just to take our order. we looked around and other tables had tea and plates and had their orders taken but our table was completely empty. We finally received a pot of tea but no cups! I had to ask another 2 times just to receive cups for tea. \nWhen they finally brought the bowls and plates for our table, they didn't even bring it to our table but just put it on the table next to us without saying a thing! The dumplings and noodle soup that we ordered were ok but nothing special and certainly wasn't worth all the hassle and poor service. We will not be coming back here.", "author": "Rob L."}

No one bothered to wipe the table; it was acceptable I guess in an equivalent of a Cantonese greasy spoon. \n\nThe place is a hole-in the wall but many great meals can be had in shopworn mom & pop spots so I wasn't deterred per se -but I also kept in mind that Dumpling Kitchen just up the street is closed on Wednesdays and I had two hungry kids in tow. \n\nBut the beef chow fun was so forgettable (heck, I'm Irish and can rock this dish that would *shame them - and I've only made it three times).\n\nI braced myself as more plates came out of the kitchen in quick succession.\n\nBoth XLB  (6 to an order) and chicken and corn dumplings (I believe there were 12) had awful, thick and sticky wrappers like they'd been steamed and sat there then maybe dunked in a finishing pot of boiling water. \n\nOf course the kids liked the XLB because they're fun- there's soup in them- and my little boy got to be the boss and show his friend how to eat them so I got a second order.\n\nI had to ask for spoons for the XLB. They were brought out testily as if mine was a special request. \n\nThe chicken wings, meh. The string beans were solid, the only high point.\n\nSince the servers aren't responsible for the food, I tipped 21%, despite the snippiness, and said \"goodbye' in Cantonese..\n\n...and I got nothin'.  \n\nIndifferent service in a small space with no ventilation and really mediocre food, especially their dumplings- tell me how this place garners a line out the door and a table is \"worth waiting for\"?\n\nI can't in good conscience bump this review to 3 stars: Total pass.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-13", "description": "We ordered an onion pancake, chicken dumplings and string beans. Onion pancakes were lightly crunchy and mildly flavoured; not spicy, a hint of pleasant salt along with a red sriracha sauce. The sauce was spicy-hot but went along well with the pancakes. \n\nChicken dumplings were as expected; a bit juicy, gooey and the chicken was mellow and well cooked. Again, it went well with the sriracha sauce. I would suggest going for string beans irrespective of what you order. They go well with whatever you order and this is after having food at Kingdom of Dumpling for at least five-seven times. They come with a base of a tingy saline and sugary sauce. \n\nOverall the food is good, worth experimenting if your taste buds are open to exciting and novelty food. Service is average, usually need to follow up on orders following the first one. Example, I remember asking for a coke, but didn't get one till the very end. \n\nOverall the food was delicious and we had a scrumptious meal. \n\nPS: they serve a complimentary green tea which is refreshing.", "author": "Darshan B."}

I first saw a TV commercial for this place many years ago and decided to give it a shot. I keep passing by it when I am on the L-Taraval line but eventually I gave in and paid it a visit. It's not as glamorous as how people see it on TV but actually really worth the price. It costs less than Din Tai Fung and it's a good diversion from the overpriced food on the other side of SF and parking is not an issue here. There are plenty of spots nearby for all sorts of vehicles. I tried the lamb dumpling and it tastes good. Normally I make my own XLB or dumplings but if there's some random ingredient I can't do then this place does the trick. They even have other nice dishes that you can get here. Also a good place for a family dinner too. \nDrawback: it can be real noisy here so please keep that in mind. The food here is no stranger to me so that too is generic.

I was circling and circling on those lookalike residential blocks hoping a space would open up, but no, I was constantly fooled by those little three-quarter spaces between the driveways. Alas, I finally found a place to park four blocks away from the restaurant, and Jamie W. and I were fighting the biting evening cold walking to this cramped spot. You can imagine our disappointment in having to sign a waiting list and sitting on a bench outside for our table to be ready.\n\nIndeed it was ten minutes later, but you had to squeeze between chairs, strollers and waitresses to get to it. We didn't waste time ordering as we started with the $7.95 Garlic String Beans which were wok-fried and thoroughly blistered the way I like 'em (photo: http://bit.ly/2nYMAFs). They were tasty if a tad oily. Jamie must have been in a takeout mood because he ordered the $7.95 XO Chicken Chow Mein which turned out to be a hefty portion of thick noodles mixed with the standard vegetables and again heavy on the greasy side (photo: http://bit.ly/2ogwHN2).\n\nI went with one of the specials way above my head on the whiteboard, the $13.95 Rack of Lamb with Rice. It wasn't a rack like Jayne Mansfield has a rack. It was three grilled lamb chops. The plate came with a bowl of rice, a dipping soy sauce, and three lonely asparagus spears - their idea of a gourmet dinner (photo: http://bit.ly/2oo5qsB). I was hoping for a little more lamb and a lot less salt but that's probably the best they can do for the price. Now you can't come to the Kingdom of Dumpling without ordering dumplings.\n\nIn order to fulfill our mission, we first ordered the $4.95 Shanghai Soup Dumplings because that's our litmus test for true dim sum and as expected, got a half-dozen in a basket (photo: http://bit.ly/2oQ5NwQ). They were just OK with a couple bereft of any broth inside. That was a bummer, and they certainly don't provide any worthy competition for Din Tai Fung. We ended our meal with the $5.95 Pork Pot Stickers (photo: http://bit.ly/2oWMO0t), which were steaming hot, hearty, and finally satisfying after all.

Maybe she should try posting something positive to help local businesses thrive instead of putting people down and making them look bad. I understand that Yelp is a forum for people to express how they feel but being someone who works in the industry it is often times just used as a forum for people to write negative and nasty things. \n\nHey lady, how about writing a positive review about something so we know that you're capable of actually liking something. You see that's what pisses me off... people who have so much time to express their hate and disdain for something yet they have no time to write one single review for an exceptional or even just a good experience they had somewhere else. In my opinion, if all of your experiences are unpleasant maybe it's because you're unpleasant.

Are you people blind? \n\nThe chinese pancakes  are always disgustingly greasy--i wrap them in a kleenex first to absorb some of the oil.  All the pot stickers are thick  lumps of half cooked white flour....again, did somebody rate this dump 5 stars?  Who? A relative of the owner's perhaps?\n\nIf you want to get rid of your current love interest....go on a eating date to Kingdom of Dump.....ling, I can guarantee that your love interest will DUMP YOU.  \n\nBETTY DAVIS said it the best, \" WHAT A DUMP!\"  \n\nThat must be why it's called, KINGDOM OF DUMP.......LING.\n\nA DUMP, stay away.", "author": "Michelle C."}

They still do a decent job on the pork dumplings, but the star used to be XLB. Today the dough texture was strangely brittle when you pick it up with your chopsticks yet mouthfeel was mushy. Flavor was decent, although the ginger soy sauce plays a big part in its balance. \n\nBeef chow fun was standard, what I expect out of a Chinese restaurant. The beef noodle soup was bland. \n\nNot sure if the owners recognized the Yelp reviews on service, but this time the greeter was too attentive; he asked us if everything was ok about 5 times during our meal, and we were only there for 20 min.

To me, it was the only visit-worthy restaurant on our short trip up north that would be open on Christmas day.  But to our disappointment, when we drove to SanTung, they were closed! \n\nSo after a quick search on Yelp and a phone call to Kingdom of Dumpling, our plans were changed.  \n\nWhen we arrived, there was no wait.  We were seated right away, which is surprising considering the many reviews and accolades that this place has received and also the small size of this restaurant.  How fortunate we were.  \n\nI didn't have much time to prepare myself on what I would order.  After all, this restaurant was a last minute decision and there was no wait time to see what others were ordering.  I had to trust my fellow Yelpers:\n\n* XLB (shanghai soup dumplings)\n* pan fried XLB (shanghai pan fried soup dumplings)\n* XO Beef ChowFun\n* Green Beans\n* Pork & Shrimp wonton with wide rice noodle soup\n\nEach dish was delicious.  \nAnd without a doubt, probably the best XLB I've ever had anywhere. In addition, their orange colored hot sauce is a beautiful mystery of its own.  I put that sauce on my dumplings, on my xo noodles, in the soup... it was outrageously addicting. \n\nI regret not ordering their non XLB dumplings or their Green Chives pancake. As I sat there eating my food, I noticed that these were also probably some of their staple items that I didn't get a chance to order.   By the time I looked up from my plate to notice the tables around me, I was already getting full. \n\nI am so glad that SanTung was closed on Christmas because it led us here. I will definitely be coming back for more.", "author": "Miyeon L."}

The shop is small, so be ready to squish your party! That also means be ready to wait. When I found this place a couple years ago, the wait went up to nearly an hour, but it hasn't been that bad as of late. The service REALLY depends on who's working. There used to be (?) an older man whose priority is to get people in and out. So don't expect great service when their priority is to get sales.\n\nWith that in mind... these are damn good dumplings. Honestly one of the best dumplings for the prince point and casual environment. I've tried other items too, chow mein, green beans, eggplant, beef and onion pancakes -\u00a0all so good! And that sauce!!! It looks like La Vics, but perfectly suited for literally anything on the menu. Creamy, spicy, and tangy. We've tried to buy their sauce before, but they don't sell it!\n\nIf you're gonna complain about parking, welcome to SF. This is the Sunset, so it's not even as bad as the rest of the city.

Uhhhh wth? You only have so many dishes on your menu, it shouldn't be that hard. Then the wide bean noodles seemed a bit undercooked (too chewy). Guys, swap your cooking times or something! \n\nLuckily the fish dumplings were standard. Standard as in YUM.

Each item came with a good number of dumplings for the price (I think 10 for all but the soup ones). The order came with only one tiny thing of dumpling sauce with was far too little given the number of dumplings. It tasted as expected, but about 3x more would have been easily used.\n\nThe vegetarian dumplings were pretty flavorless, and clearly the equivalent of mystery meat but for vegetables (a mash of vegetables with no big chunks or anything clearly identifiable). It was probably mostly cabbage. \n\nThe shrimp in the shrimp dumplings was really good, but there was only 1-2 little pieces per dumpling!!! I'd say 90% of the filling volume was chive, meaning that if you ate the dumpling in two bits, you really only got 1 with shrimp in it. \n\nThe soup dumplings looked the best and after a little zap in the microwave there was actual soup in them. I didn't try them, but I was told they were far and away the best part of the meal.\n\nThe outside of the dumplings was solid, a good thickness and texture.

I personally liked their steamed soup dumplings which were steamed just right not to make the soup inside too scalding hot to eat. Tried the pork and shrimp dumplings with chives and the chicken with chives. The pork and shrimp were ok but unremarkable, the chicken dumplings in my opinion were the better. The chicken tasted juicy and worked well with the chives. Also ordered the fried soup dumplings which weren't my favorite, it was a bit too doughy for my tastes. Ended up also ordering some wings and string beans. The wings were meh, I wouldn't recommend them. The string beans were a surprise as they were very flavorful and the string beans themselves were fresh and crunchy. The place is tiny so expect a wait on busy times. The food here I'd say is reasonably priced. FYI they only do 1 credit card per table so have cash or venmo ready if you're going with friends.

The soup dumpling, garlic beans, crispy green onion and beef pancake was amazing. If you are in search of this kind of cuisine then I say this place is a must.  I will go again. I look forward to taking friends. The restaurant itself is a small hole in the wall. Be prepared to stand in line. The inside is old and in need of help. The zaggot awards gave it 25 out of 30 for food, 6 out of 30 for decor. The staff is a bit rude and that may be a bit because their English is limited.

Also, you apparently have a twin called King of Noodles in Inner Sunset, which I did not know served xiao long bao! I guess I took your names at face value.\n\nThis place is quite petite, but the waiter has the best sense of humor. We ordered dumplings and noodles, after which he commented that we didn't have any vegetables. I replied, \"Carbs only!\" and he laughed and said, \"But you're so skinny!\" A+++ for you, my friend.\n\nThe first dish that came out was the BEEF STEW SOUP NOODLE, $7.45, which you can customize to be spicy (they just throw in some of their homemade orange spicy sauce). My friend wanted it spicy, which, fortunately, is not that spicy for those weak-of-chile. The noodles, like King of Noodles, are homemade, doughy, and not that chewy. The broth is surprisingly light and unsalty in a good way. The meat is thinly-cut beef shank, and some quarters of bok choy and black fungus mushrooms are thrown in for good measure. However, I personally prefer beef chuck cubes over beef shank, so I wasn't in love with the dish.\n\nThe next dish was the CHICKEN DUMPLINGS WITH GREEN CHIVES, 12 pieces for $6.95. Hearty filling, delicious dumplings. I like it.\n\nThird dish was the SHANGHAI SOUP DUMPLINGS (xiao long bao), 6 pieces for $4.95. The dumplings are shaped as thin peaks rather than wide blobs, which is a change of pace. The thickness of the wrapper is on par with that of Dumpling Kitchen, the soup is plentiful, but the amount of pork filling is somewhat lacking.\n\nSame issue with quantity of meat applies to their SHANGHAI PAN FRIED SOUP DUMPLINGS (sheng jian bao), which, despite the English description, contain no soup. $4.95 for 4 pieces, which is kind of pricey... BUT. Even though their meat insides are quite minuscule, they do the best job with a light, fluffy breading, shaped into a cute bun, fried golden brown on the bottom and topped with sesame seeds and chopped green onions on top. This has been the least dense and least oily of the sheng jian baos I've tried in the city, which makes it my favafav.\n\nDumpling Kitchen for xiao long bao, Kingdom of Dumpling for sheng jian bao and an ego booster.", "author": "Adele F."}

The dumplings are house-made and flavorful and have a good skin thickness to meat ratio (pretty balanced). Sauce isn't 100% soysauce and/or vinegar thank god. Dumplings are 100. And although they have a wide variety of foods on the menu, I'd say most of them are pretty standard and not extraordinary.\n\nTheir beef pancake is a little disappointing in that it's very greasy and the pancake isn't the usual chewy scallion pancakes I'm used to, rather it's some type of fried, dense, dough? Maybe a regional nuance but the beef is also ground but I was expecting tender beef slices (ok I'm probably thinking of Taiwanese beef rolls which aren't pancakes but that's what I wanted). \n\nI also had their beef noodle bowl which was alright. Towards the end the noodles started tasting like salt and I couldn't finish it--especially since there was too many noodles for the toppings that came with it. \n\nWill return for more dumplings!", "author": "Lydia Z."}

Let me explain, part of this experience was the interaction with Lee, he took our order at a rapid fire pace. There was a large group that left ahead of us and 4 tables were seated at once. I swear he took all four table orders in about 1.30 seconds, when you sit down know what you want to order! When he took our order we heard green beans and they were delivered to the table and they were so good, they were in a soy sauce base with so much cooked garlic I was stealing every piece I could get my chopsticks on. \n\nWe were a little boring, we had the pork and chive dumplings and they were wonderful. We had Beijing bean paste noodles, on the menu it said it was a soup, there was no broth but it was ever so good. The couple next to us who are regulars told us to order the dumplings in a soup because the broth is so good. \n\nThis is not the place for the long conversation, be kind, and mindful that there are 15 people standing outside.

Yes! But beware. Kingdom of Dumpling is the perfect definition of \"hole-in-the-wall.\" This place is TINY. We had to put a chair on the side, making a two seat table to accommodate three people. \n\nMy first thought was, \"Wow this place is tiny.\" Then it became, \"Wow, how am I supposed to pig out with such a tiny table!??!!\" It's a real problem! What if I want to order the whole menu?! \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't have the stomach to order the whole menu. Instead, we went with two orders of their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings), one order of pork and chive dumplings, one XO beef chow fun, and one onion pancake. The food was ready very fast! \n\nTheir Xiao long bao were done really nicely. They weren't sweet and the soup was yummy. However, there wasn't enough soup in some of them. Some of them just looked like plain dumplings -- all dried up on the inside! I also wished that they had more flavor as well. NEEDS MOAR MSG!!!!!!!\n\nThe pork and chive dumplings were juicy and really delicious! The skin of the dumplings was a little on the thick side but I love that! It gives it a little chew. And you know what else is great with these dumplings? THEIR HOT SAUCE. Their hot sauce is filled with minced garlic and peppers. It was spicy and delicious! It went wonderful with the dumplings! I think by the end of the night, I had about 4-5 spoonfuls of the deliciousauce! \n\nThe XO beef chow fun was pretty much beef chow fun. Why is it called XO? I don't think there was a gram of XO sauce in that thing haha! It was pretty decent regardless. It had enough of that wok aroma! Gotta eat it when it's still hot/warm though! \n\nThe onion pancake? It was really oily but it was still very good. It did lack the stretchiness that I typically love. It was also a little bit more thick than what you would imagine it to be but that's fine. It tastes good and my boyfriend gobbled pretty much the whole thing up! \n\nIf you need the restroom, you'll have to venture past their tiny kitchen to get to it (but hey at least they got one right?!). Surprisingly, the bathroom is not as tiny as you would think it is. It's actually quite roomy.\n\n:) I would definitely come back for their dumplings and hot sauce.

Just be mindful of how much you order. Seriously. Everything is so cheap that I need to constantly keep myself from ordering half the menu. To get a little taste of all they have to offer, I'd recommend 1 order of a dozen dumplings (I love the lamb and chives dumplings), 1 order of flat noodle soup with dumplings (comes with 6 more of your choosing), and of course, the garlic string beans. That's enough to share between 2 people. Their dumplings are very juicy and seasoned well, that's what separates them from the rest. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Small place.

My favorite is the shrimp and chive, which admittedly is 80% garlic chive and 20% shrimp, but I think it tastes better that way anyway. I also love the beef noodle soup, both spicy and regular. The broth is on the clear-ish side with a bit of five spice seasoning. Don't expect a dark brown Taiwanese style broth- this isn't that. My only complaint about this place is that they no longer use hand-pulled noodles though- now they just use standard factory made flour ones.", "author": "Jean L."}

The interior is a little sanatorium-esque with all white walls, and the specials are written on paper taped to the walls... in guess what color?  :P White - no way!  Tables are covered with checkered table cloths under glass top.  The signs taped to the dirty window overlooking the street are crumply and stained.  The signs taped to the walls are outdated, bragging of dishes that have been offered for years, purporting them as \"new\" (per my boyfriend, who has been there many times in the past).  \n\nOrdering experience:  It was slightly difficult to order because of the language barrier with our server.  He also pressured us into expanding our order with another dish, and by our own fault, we chose a dish that ended up being our least favorite by a large margin.  We were not even that hungry to begin with and we shouldn't have succumbed.\n\nFood:\n\nJellyfish with cucumbers and carrots - BLAND 1/5\n\nTofu skin with cilantro - SALTY and terrible, also, the pieces of tofu that were stuck together were a little undercooked. 0/5\n\nIn my opinion, both non dumpling dishes should be better flavored.  Either work on the non-dumpling items, or remove from the menu.\n\nPork and chive dumplings and soup dumplings were fine. The dumpling skin is thick and white in color, not the most appetizing looking.  My boyfriend said it tasted better before, and it has gone slightly downhill at least in presentation.  For example, they used to plate the soup dumplings on top of Napa cabbage. Now it is presented on top of wax paper. 4/5\n\nWhen asked how everything was, I told the waiter the tofu skin wasn't my favorite and he said nothing.  Wait staff was nice enough but did not do anything to ensure we had a good experience.\n\nI wouldn't mind the ambiance and look of the restaurant if it could back it up with spectacular food.  This was just kind of a hole in the wall with average quality dumplings and below average other offerings.  Disappointing.", "author": "Christina G."}

Over the last half decade, it has exploded with popularity and now, the place is always packed with a regular group of people waiting outside. \n\nTheir dumplings are soothing and delicious! I always order the pork and napa cabbage dumplings, which has a nice soft skin and subtle juicy flavors in the dumplings. Although the flavors by itself are not heavy, it pairs perfectly with the soy sauce/vinegar provided. I also love their garlic string beans and garlic cucumbers, very fresh, flavorful, and crunchy. The beef pancake is a pretty good size and tastes good also. It is a little oily, but that is to be expected with these types of pancakes. Recently, I tried their beef stew noodle soup, which has a nice and soothing soup broth with plenty chunks of beef stew, soft and delicious noodles, fresh bok choy, and mushrooms. This would be perfect for a cold day.\n\nA couple items we ordered that I think I can skip next time - the salt pepper tofu and the green onion pancake. The salt pepper tofu lacked a good salt pepper flavor and instead, kind of had a little odd flavor to it. It was a little bland. The green onion pancake was not bad, but it should be ordered with traditional small dishes that compliment the green onion pancake. By itself, it was a little plain and a little dry.  \n\nIt was HOT inside the little restaurant. We sat at the table next to the kitchen, which made it even hotter. The owner and staff were very attentive and talkative. Although I do like eating here, I usually don't like to wait long for a table. I definitely would recommend this restaurant, but incase you don't like to wait, you can come before or after peak lunch/dinner times...OR you can buy frozen dumplings from their to-go shop on Taraval and bring them home to cook.", "author": "Jean S."}

It is cramped and warm from the fire in the kitchen and I love it so so much! As with many Chinese restaurants, they excel at certain dishes and the rest is mediocre.  I've eaten here at least once every other month for many years and I still love it. Their orange hot sauce is house made mouthwatering. If you want to have more Kingdom of Dumpling in your life, you can walk down the street to their wholesale and buy bags of dumplings from their freezers. \n\nHere's the tasty bites you should try!\n\nAppetizers: \n\nMa La Niu Jin (spicy beef tendon) - It's the best tendon dish I've had. It's thinly sliced to perfection and easy to eat. I've fed it to many unsuspecting, unadventurous eaters who loved it. \n\nTofu noodle with cilantro - It's a very simple dish. It's light, fresh and satisfying.\n\nCong you bing (green onion pancake) - It's delicious and crunchy. I make it at home so I don't usually buy it, but it's great. \n\nDumplings:  \n\nMy favorite are the lamb dumplings and pork with chive. The rest are amazing as well, although I would not recommend the fish dumplings or the vegetarian dumplings since the filling texture is too mushy. \n\nSheng jian bao - pan fried buns with soup are excellent. I don't think they're listed in the menu but they always have them! \n\nDon't get their xiao long bao (soup dumplings). Often times they soup has already drained out of them and the skins are a little too thick. Stick with the dumplings and walk down the street to Dumpling Kitchen for your XLB. \n\nMains: \n\nFried string beans are delicious.

All were pretty good for the price you pay. I would def recommend the green chives pancake; it was very crispy and full of flavor!! The XLB was ok. The dumplings seemed like they were boiled for a bit too long as the skin was soggy and was about to rip. I would not recommend the spicy beef noodle soup because the soup base tasted like water with a HINT of beef flavor & they used chili oil to make it spicy. The best part about the noodle soup was the beef itself-- very tender and flavorful. It's too bad the soup and noodles couldn't complement it. \n\nService was great.

Still tasty for a starter. \n\nIn terms of wait, the wait is semi long (30 min to an hour at times) especially after 5:30, but it is worth it if you really are craving some dim sum!!

Tucked in in a little shop, you find amazing, petite sized little mouthfuls of yumminess in each dumpling! This restaurant is extremely small (imagine the size of a kitchen and a small dining room that holds less than 15 people). Extremely cozy and staff are kind. Sitting in close quarters, you can see the chef cook in the background as well- something that is so comforting especially in a small business restaurant.\n\nI would have just bypassed this place if I was walking by but thank goodness my little sister found it! Each plate of dumplings has 10 pieces and the soup dumplings have 6. My little sister and I got a plate of shrimp and chives dumpling, a plate of chicken and Napa cabbage dumplings, an order of soup dumplings and an order of fried green beans.\n\nThe green beans were cooked perfectly with a nice sear to it and perfectly crisp. As she was cooking it, I noticed a flash of flames in the background behind me and I realized those were our green beans cooking, the chef does have some amazing cooking skills!!\n\nOur shrimp and chives were so flavorful- lots of chives and a penny sized piece of shrimp in each dumpling but oh so flavorful! The chicken and Napa cabbage dumpling tastes like a dumpling from trader joes but a lot fresher and you can tell the skins of the dumpling are made fresh to order.\n\nWhat are soup dumplings you ask?! It is a steamed dumpling with a small amount of broth in every bite!!!!! At first, I cut it open on my plate and noticed a bit of soup coming out on my plate, then I realized I can put the dumpling on my spoon, bite off a piece of it and sip the soup on my spoon. \n\nAll in all, for sure I will be coming back to this restaurant!!!

Lamb dumplings, also a must. Guys, I don't even eat lamb. But I pop these little suckers like they're popcorn. Actually, I always eat dumplings like popcorn. Then chug some vinegar after.

It is a indeed a hole-in-the-wall, but not in the cutesy romanticized sense--it's small and modest with no Instagrammable ambiance, and it doesn't help that the red-and-white plaid plastic tablecloths look out-of-place like they have been transplanted from Bucca di Peppo.  But nothing can stop me in the never-ending quest for the perfect XLB.\n\nWe started with the CILANTRO BEAN CURD, which was refreshing and makes you feel healthy (if I ever go through a vegetarian phase, Taiwanese bean curd noodle will definitely be a staple).  The chewy tofu texture is the QQ-est of all noodles, and whatever mystery sauce they use complements the soy flavors very well: an appetizing appetizer.\n\nThe PORK AND NAPA CABBAGE DUMPLING tasted deliciously homemade and I especially liked how light it was.  Dumplings at some places use pork so fatty it's almost sickening, but you can devour the Dumplings of the Kingdom and still have space in your stomach for more of their other amazing food\n\nMy honest opinion of the XLB is that it is a good honest attempt with nicely balanced soup and pork flavors.  However the skin is horrendously thick and chewy--for any XLB snobs that make comparisons to the DTF/Crystal Jade (which are such juggernauts it seems like they engineer their XLB to perfection).  It also has a bit of a funny look that reminds me of stiff peaks (yes I've been baking lately) so your food porn may be a little silly.\n \nI was excited to try the green chive pancake which looked like pockets of chivey goodness, but they said they sold out se we replaced it with the BEEF PANCAKE.  The beef could arguably be bland, but on the plus side that means it wasn't too salty.  The pancake was toasty, and like the rest of the food here, I really liked the light, (relatively) healthy, homemade cooking style.  It's like I just became best friends with someone who can cook delish TW/Shanghai food from family recipes.\n\nTotal after tax was ~$25.. whaaa!  (Or in Chinese lingo, I guess it should be waaah!)  In the Parkside Three Kingdoms for dumplings (the other two being Dumpling Kitchen and House of Pancakes), I think Kingdom of Dumping wins.\n\nTip: They have another location on Taraval that sells frozen dumplings!  They should call it the Kingdom of Dumpling kitchen just to troll with Dumpling Kitchen", "author": "Edna C."}

I've been visited Kingdom of Dumplings couple times but haven't really thought about writing a review for them.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling is the typical small and homey Chinese restaurant. The seats are limited and customers sit very close to each other when dine in, however, that doesn't affect any bit of the comfort food they've got here. Friendly with smiles on their faces, the staff sure know how to warm the customers' hearts up. \n\nFor the most recent visit, we had Grilled Lamb Skewer, Shanghai Soup Dumpling (aka Xiao Long Bao), Stir-fried String Beans and Beef Roll. \n\nGrilled Lamb Skewer: be aware if you are not the citizens of spicy-land, they sprinkled canyon pepper on the top and that made us in fire, had to order soda to cool the tongues off. Surprisingly it was less spicier the next day after re-heated in the microwave. Nice texture, meat itself was tender and very flavorful.\n\nShanghai Soup Dumpling: I guess I don't have to put anymore words on this but the portion was on point, I usually dip light in the sauce and then eat the whole dumpling, let the soup explode in my mouth and experience everything in that little thing.\n\nStir-fried String Beans: your go-to veggies. If you like medium cook and still have that little crunchy-ness when you chew it, this is for you. A little bit heavy on the dressing and I just dipped on the edge and it was all good.\n\nBeef Roll: different than I expected, I was thinking about the pancake and beef roll together (with cilantro which I usually hate), this one had the stuffing (beef and green onions) in the pancake, and slice in equal 4 piece -- think about pita bread (pocket) with meat patty in there -- here you go. Tasty, juicy, filled up my tummy. \n\nThe owner (seems like he is the owner) was busy checking on every table to make sure everything is alright. Before we left, he came up to the door with a big smile and said goodbye. I smiled back and said \"thank you\". Reasonable price, good portion, nice staff, I will be back again for sure. \n\nps.

Like I went to Saison and rated them five stars, but me giving Kingdom of Dumpling four stars doesn't mean they are 80% as good.\n\nAnyway, within the category of cheap Chinese food, I think this place is amazing. I've been here a ton of times and it's always solid. The variety of dumplings is great, with clearly different flavors. Pork and corn is a particularly good one, as the sweet corn taste goes well with the salty pork. The xiao long bao are perfect to me, granted I've never been to Shanghai but they are as good as any I've had anywhere in Northern California or NYC. I would also highly recommend the beef pancake, which is amazing! The crispy skin and spiced beef mixture is so intensely savory. If you want to kick it up one more notch, slather some of the orange spicy sauce they have inside. It's got vinegar and hot peppers in it, and adds to the whole thing. Just remember that when these come out of the oven, they are lava hot, so give it a few minutes to cool!\n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars rather than 5 for two reasons. First, the bathroom situation is ridiculous. You have to walk through the cramped, steamy kitchen to get there, and while it's clean enough, it's just too small. My second complaint dovetails with that, in that the restaurant itself is way too small. I get SF rent is crazy, but come on, there's like 8 tables and the line can get ridiculous. The place makes enough money to warrant some sort of expansion.\n\nThey take credit cards, which is awesome, but in typical Chinese fashion will only split 2. Also, if you find yourself behind a big line of people, put your name on the list and go have a drink across the street! This place is pretty close to the ocean, and it gets cold and windy at night, so instead of waiting on the sidewalk like a chump, go into a bar and grab a cocktail like a pro.\n\nLast thing, I wish Yelp would disallow pictures of food that have been bitten. I wish I could speak to everyone who posts pictures of half-eaten xiao long baos and tell them \"hey idiot, nobody wants to see your mid-meal food!\" And I get that sometimes you eat some food, then remember you wanted to take a picture, but come on, do you think people want to see photos of dirty plates with solitary dumplings on them?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-04", "description": "Kingdom of Dumpling tastes like home to me. Beijing, Northern China home. Everything, from the hole-in-the-wall location that boasts of ten cramped tables at most, to the authentic handmade dumplings, to the \"\u5927\u5988\" in the back of the kitchen yelling orders is nostalgic. If you're not familiar with Northern Chinese cuisine, you should know that it's on a whole not known for its stir-fried dishes, but rather for its flour-based foods such as noodles, bready pancakes, and most of all, dumplings. I sampled a variety of three kinds of dumplings this time around, and I was incredibly impressed. \n\nOne thing that's important to note is their policy for no add-on orders. You must order everything at once.  If you're looking for to-go frozen dumplings, you have to go to their other location a couple blocks away, as this location only serves as a restaurant. They also provide each table with old-school dipping sauce: black vinegar with ginger slivers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#297YAMl2nK_XjTHRi3OnVA).\n\nSliced pig ear appetizer (cold, spicy if desired):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#CdY82DteUpyjwv3VOm6MMA)\nI thought this cold appetizer dish was well-made. Pig ears are cartilaginous in the middle and soft on the outside, so it creates a contrast of textures on its own. The sauce was just the right amount of saltiness, and we added on some spiciness to give it some more kick. I think this would have been good without the spiciness as well though.\n\nLamb dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#SEYoCOs31U5C0q-9FFSuaQ)\nThese are probably the heaviest dumplings out of the three that I tried, but the flavor was quite good. Lamb has that gamey taste, but even without too many other ingredients, the flavor of that wasn't overwhelming here. Dipped into the black vinegar to cut the grease, these were really good. I might still prefer the chive and napa cabbage and pork ones more though.\n\nPork and chive dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#zkNKOXn4c9L6cCZjJ887Vg)\nSuper authentic, and really delicious. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, but the filling wasn't overly salty either. The dumplings were boiled perfectly (three times!) so that they were cooked all the way through but the wrappers were still elastic. The chives were plentiful and cut (not chopped) to a good size. Probably my favorite rendition of pork and chive dumplings in the states.\n\nPork and napa cabbage dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#PuB9utjf1xXVFVNpym9yUQ)\nNapa cabbage has a more subtle flavor, probably the most subtle of the vegetables used in dumplings, and it's easy to try and overcompensate for it. But not here! The ratio of pork to napa cabbage was spot-on, and the flavor was really good. Again, these were perfectly boiled and I loved the elasticity of the handmade wrappers. \n\nI can't remember the last time I had such authentic, homey dumplings.. possibly before my grandma passed away. I'll definitely be back, although it'll be hard to try their other fare since I already have my heart set on their chive and napa cabbage dumplings..", "author": "Maggie X."}

Placed an order on Eat24 and got a confirmation my order would be ready in around 30 mins. I showed up around 30 mins later. \n\nWhen I walked in, no one would acknowledge me. When I finally talked to one of the ladies clearing a table, she checked in with someone from the kitchen. She told me to wait outside so I walked outside. After some back and forth between the employees, a man walked over to me and told me they didn't get my order. I mentioned that eat24 confirmed it, but he said since they have 2 locations, the boss who confirmed the order was at the other location so he hadn't sent the order to this restaurant yet. So I gave him my order again and waited outside. \n\nAt this point, the roommate had been circling around cuz parking in this area sucks. So now I had to tell him it'd be another 20 mins. He found a place to pull over but this was super annoying to say the least! The guy who took my order kept saying 5 more mins even though I knew it would take longer. We finally got our order and went home. We ordered the following:\n\nCrispy chicken wings ($5.95)\nShrimp dumpling with green chives ($6.95)\nShanghai soup dumpling ($4.95)\nShanghai pan fried soup dumpling ($4.95)\nPork pot sticker ($5.95)\nBeef pancake ($5.95)\nXO beef chow fun ($6.95)\nGarlic string beans ($6.95)\n\nI actually enjoyed a lot of the non dumpling dishes. The string beans were crunchy and flavorful. The XO beef chow fun had a good amount of beef and bean sprouts. The beef pancake was filled with delicious layers of beef. The dumplings were actually a disappointment. Not sure if it was cuz we got take out, but the Soup dumplings lost all their soup. The Shrimp dumpling with green chives was mostly chives and not so much shrimp.\n\nI might come back to sit down and eat since I really wanna try the deliciousness of the XLB that everyone seems to have experienced. But I'll probably never get take out from them again. If you decide to order online, make sure to call them to confirm!", "author": "Elena N."}

We came around 8:30pm on a Saturday, and our table of four was seated immediately. I think we were pretty lucky, because a few other groups came after us, and they had to wait for table. \n\nAs for the shanghai dumplings, each had a huge mouthful of soup in each one. The soup to meat ratio felt like 2:1. There actually wasn't all that much meat in each dumpling; it was mostly soup! The dumpling skin wasn't especially thin, but I guess that made easier to pick up. The dumplings were served PIPING HOT, so I'd recommend letting them cool for a good few minutes before popping the whole thing in your mouth. \n\nOther good dishes were:\n:: Farmer's cucumber - classic pickled cucumber served in China. Bonus, they use ORGANIC cucumber. \n:: Cold wide bean noodle - another good starter dish with cucumber and bean noodle. It has a similar flavor to the farmer's cucumber though, so I'd probably order one or the other.\n:: Pork and corn dumplings - the corn gives a nice hint of sweetness to the dumplings. Very authentic. \n:: Pot stickers - the skin has a nice chewy texture, and the bottom is slightly crispy. They had originally botched up this order, and they made a whole new order for us. The boss paid high attention to quality! Wish they had told us this rather than wait for us to ask about it before explaining.\n\nDishes I'd pass on: \n:: Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) - the bottom wasn't crispy enough, and the bread was soggy from the soup. I've definitely had better.\n:: Canned soda - not served cold, and no ice.\n\nThe boss made the whole experience that much better, because he was extremely attentive to every table -- I don't know how he did it! He heard every comment that we made, even though he was rushing around serving dishes and taking orders. He was also very friendly and constantly came back to check that we were doing well. Great service, but he could've communicated better about the pot stickers instead of waiting for us to ask about it. Awesome that they take credit card!", "author": "Audrey L."}

I've had Kingdom of Dumplings bookmarked for a while and decided to try it one night so I picked up three of my friends from Embarcadero and Fillmore to come here. This area is not very public transportation friendly apparently! \n\nWe came on a Sunday night and street parking was fairly easy to find. There were around 4 groups of 2 to 4 people ahead of us. The restaurant is pretty tiny and doesn't seat very many people so it was always packed. The wait was surprisingly short though and not too bad. Service was super friendly as well. This restaurant was a little overhyped in my opinion but I still enjoyed it and it satisfied my craving for a home cooked meal. \n\nString beans 4/5 - I loved dipping my dumplings in the soy sauce that came with these string beans. \nXLB and dumplings 4/5 - We ordered two dumplings and one XLB. They all came out hot and fresh but I still like my mom's XLB and dumplings better. \nBeef pancake 4/5 - This was good! I've never had pancake with meat inside. \nChicken wings 3/5 - For some reason, I was expecting the fried salt and pepper chicken wings so I was surprised when these came out. The wings were sweet but not too flavorful. \nChow Fun 2/5 - There wasn't enough sauce or flavor. This ranks maybe at the bottom of the list of chow fun I have tried. \n\nAfter dinner, we walked around for dessert and found Marco Polo ice cream down the street. I would definitely recommend going there for an after dinner treat!", "author": "Karen L."}

You will not need to venue too far from Taraval Street, which blends in the Parkside Neighborhood and outer Sunset District. This neighborhood happens to be home to several of the best Chinese dumpling houses in the city without having to shell out a premium price. The options for stellar dumplings may be plentiful. Kingdom of Dumpling, however, may be my personal favorite. The dumplings here are superb! They are 100% handmade in-house daily and delicious.\n\nThese Beijing style dumplings are characteristic for their thicker, more doughy skins. The texture, however, was almost velvet-like soft. The pork and other main ingredients wrapped inside the skins came piping hot, juicy and so flavorful. \n\nXiaolongbao or Shanghai Soup Dumplings (12), $9.90 - their prized soup dumplings were prepared flawlessly! The skin was soft to the touch but kept enough firmness to hold its texture. The meat actually bounced in the broth inside. The soup was still simmering hot and the pork, customarily rolled up into a ball, was unbelievably tasty. They were right up there on my short list of the best xia long bao I have tasted.\n\nThe other dishes we ordered I would highly recommend as well.\n\nPork Dumplings with Green Chives (12), $5.95 - one of my favorite dumpling combinations because these green garlic chives really enhances the flavor of pork. You get a hint of garlic as you bite into each juicy morsel. \n\nPork and Shrimp Dumplings (12), $6.45 - I always order this combination and it is a good barometer of how special the dumplings are. Both the flavors of the pork and shrimp really came through and had just the right amount of firmness, not overly cooked. The juiciness of the shrimp indicated its freshness and that it was not frozen prior.\n\nPork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage (12), $5.95 - another undeniably delicious combination. There is just enough cabbage to marry the flavor of pork and balance the saltiness. It also added texture to the meat.\n\nShanghai style donuts (2) , $2.95 - a gooey flour dough, topped with sesame seeds, and filled with warm sweet red beans. It was incredibly delicious and a wonderful surprise.\n\nThe preparation and taste of the dumplings here are hard to match.

We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated in a cramped corner where both myself and one of my friends could feel the heart beat of the guests behind us because we were seated so close. The first round of complimentary tea was cold as the North Pole the next was hot as the devils piss. In the time we were seated with menus, the six top next to us had ordered, gotten their food, and was half way done by the time our server even acknowledges us. We made eye contact with all of the servers and attempted to flag them down but nothing. Right after they took our order, the server proceeded to take the orders of people waiting outside for a table. What the heck man. My friends beer took at least 10 minutes to get to the table. But wait... there's more. After an eternity our dumplings were scrumptious. However the server dropped our hieroglyph check when we were all still very clearly eating. We gave exact change and did not tip. Don't waste your time here, they have no clue how to run a flipping restaurant.

Since San Jose is too far away and the waits are ridiculous, does Kingdom of Dumpling scratch that XLB itch? For the most part, I'd have to say yes. \n\nThe xlb are flavorful and well constructed. They come 6 to an order, and were ready to go as soon as we sat down (they take your order while you're waiting, which I think is a pretty cool way to compensate for the lack of space within the restaurant). The broth has a good amount of depth and the pork is very flavorful. They're certainly not as delicate as the DTF offerings, but are delicious nonetheless. The thickness and consistency of the shell reminded me of the xlb at Shanghai Dumpling King, another one of SF's hole in the wall XLB joints. \n\nWe ordered several other dishes, some of which I actually enjoyed far more than the xlb (for just the xlb I would give this place 3 stars). \n\nOrder these:\n- Pig ears: Fantastically seasoned, chewy and tender. Served cold and was a great complement with the other hot dishes. I would order these again in a second.\n- Lamb dumpling w/ Chinese Vegetable: The lamb/veggie filling inside was delicious, and the dumpling skin was far more delicate than the xlb. Another must order dish.\n\nCould take or leave:\n- Black bean string beans; The flavor was pretty good, but they were really under-seasoned, The black bean sauce was fairly watery so it didn't really stick to the beans very well. Okay, would probably order again for a veggie dish.\n- Salt & Pepper Tofu: Again, it tasted good. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which is what you want. However, when this dish came out the soft insides of the tofu were hotter than the surface of the sun. I ate and entire one and just bit into it, and am still feeling the burn on the top of my mouth today. Let these cool down for a few minutes unless you want to destroy the inside of your mouth.\n\nSkip these:\n- Bei Jing Bean Paste Noodle: This is their take on black bean noodles. There was a decidedly unpleasant metallic taste that the noodles had. The noodle texture also wasn't too great. I only ate a couple spoons, and didn't want to eat any more. Definitely not one of their stronger dishes.\n- Onion pancake: The flavor was pretty good, but dense and very oily -- so much so that some of the pieces were almost transparent.

Hm, where to begin..\n\nLet's start off with walking into the restaurant.  It's like a heatwave just exploded into your face.  For my fellow yogis out there, it's literally like stepping into a Bikram studio.  Then, cram about 25-30 people into a very small space where everyone is pretty much elbow to elbow.  The back of my chair is back-to-back to the person behind me, and I am pretty much sandwiched in between the table and my chair with maybe about an inch of breathing room.  Keep in mind that you are also in a very warm and steamy environment.  While it may be great during a Bikram sesh, it's definitely not a pleasant experience when you're trying to eat.  Wonder if I can introduce them to a good contractor so they can get some ventilation in there...\n\nThen comes the service.  Ok I'm not expecting Gary Danko-level of service at a dumpling house.  I think I'm being totally reasonable.  Our waitress got into a small altercation with 3 tables.  She got orders wrong, she was not very friendly, and every time someone ordered a dish that took a bit longer than usual (i.e. if you decide to opt for pan fried dumplings versus steamed dumplings, it's may take up to 15 minutes to prepare), she would try to convince them to get something else.  And when she was unsuccessful, she would roll her eyes and stomp away.  We didn't order enough food for everyone, so we tried to get a server's attention for a menu.  Our table was in the very back corner, so it was a little difficult to flag someone down.  It took us, no joke, 10 minutes just to get someone's attention.  However, the plus side is, the food actually came out pretty quickly.  \n\nIf you don't mind all the above, I guess the redeeming quality would be the food.  The dumplings aren't the BEST I've had, but they are decent.  The prices are fairly low and servings are fairly generous, so you can order a bunch of stuff and sample different things.  Salt and pepper fried tofu is one of my staple dishes that I always order.  It was, again, decent, but it could use some garlic or some more spices to give it that extra kick; the Shanghai Dumplings were the best out of the dumplings I tried; and lastly I really enjoyed the grilled lamb skewers.  They were perfectly spiced and grilled to perfection.  \n\nPerhaps a two-star rating might be a bit harsh.  But I don't think i can give it 3 stars for an overall experience.  There are plenty of other establishments that serve delicious dumplings in a much more pleasant environment. \n\nIn sum - 2.5 stars.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

The servers are utilitarian at best and clearly are most comfortable with Mandarin, followed by Cantonese, followed by limited English.

My sister and I came here on a Saturday night at around 9pm, put our name on the list, and waited no more than 10 minutes for a seat. Prior to being seated, Lee, whom I'm assuming is the owner asks us what we would like to order, so we quickly scanned the menu and placed our order for Chicken Chow Mein, Xiao Long Bao, Chicken with Napa Cabbage dumplings, and String Beans. Our orders came out fairly quickly, which was nice because we were starving! We both concluded that the Xiao Long Bao and the String Beans were the best out of the four dishes we ordered, so placed another order for the Xiao Long Bao shortly after. I would skip the Chicken with Napa Cabbage dumplings and the Chicken Chow Mein!\n\nKingdom of Dumpling is the true definition of hole in the wall type place with cramped seating holding no more than 20 people at a time, servers using Starbucks aprons, and Asian ladies yelling in the kitchen. Loved it! Lee was great and seemed genuinely happy that his customers enjoyed the food! After correcting my pronunciation of Xiao Long Bao, he showed us how to eat the soup dumplings and even commented that we were doing a good job. He seemed very hospitable and wanted to talk to everyone in the restaurant, which was great to see. I noticed that whenever people left, he made sure to shake everyone's hand and personally thank them for dining at his restaurant!\n\nOur total was $40, but should have been around $32. With tip, it was $50!\n\nThe XLB is amazing, the service is great, and the prices are reasonable, however, please do yourself a favor and check your receipt before you pay!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-11", "description": "I have been writing this review in my head for days.  Let me just start by saying that this is the best Chinese food I have ever had, along side with my beloved Gary Chu's in Santa Rosa, CA.  \n\nI have lived in SF for almost 10 years, searching high and low for good Chinese food and I have finally found it.  When we showed up around 7:30 on Friday night there was a line outside waiting for tables.  The wait staff came outside numberous times to bring more chairs for the waiting people to sit and asked each party personally what their name was (there was a list hanging from the door that you can just write your name and party size on), to be sure that we felt we were not being forgotten or overlooked.  The one sort-of head honcho male server was so friendly and when he sat us at a table squished in the corner, he apologised and said we could move when another one opened up- we didn't mind at all though.  The restaurant is tiny with very few tables, but you get your food quick so we only waited outside for about 15 mins tops. \n\nI noticed, what I thought were asparagus, on every table.  I looked for asparagus on the menu and didn't see it but did see Garlic Green Beans, I figued the \"asparagus\" might be really large beans and if not, the green beans would still probably be good.  Turns out they were green beans and they are the winner winner Kingdom of Dumpling dinner.  They are amazing, you MUST order these, end of story.\n\nI ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, cuz #WIR (when in rome, it's gonna be a thing, spread it around) and they were good, some might say a tad bland but really comforting and delicious, I appreciated the delicate flavor. \n\nThe potstickers were wonderful, nice and soft dough with yummy inside and one crunchy side, the vinegar dipping sauce with shallot was great with them. \n\nThe chow fun was good, I wouldn't necessarily order it again though, we got it with beef per the recommendation of our friendly server.  I would just imagine there are other more incredible dishes to try on the menu.  Next time I would like to try the green onion pancake, I get the feeling it is really great there- lots of people ordering it and I kept hearing the staff recommending it. \n\nThe real winner was the fried rice. I know that sounds crazy but I'm telling you.  You MUST order the chicken fried rice.  I told the server \" ummm we want to get some friend rice too I think\" and he matter-of-factly said \"chicken fried rice\" and wrote it down with no questions asked.  This fried rice was the most flavorful and texturally pleasing fried rice I have ever had.  It was soooo flavorful.  But the best part is the pieces of chicken are white meat, from what I noticed, but I think what they do is take skin-on chicken, render the skin and cook the meat, then probably refrigerate it.  Then they probably chop it up when ready to cook with it and throw it into a screaming hot wok.  What you end up with is moist, juicy chicken with the crispiest, thinnest layer of skin on it.  I am getting emotional just remembering it.  It was phenomenal people. \n\nI cannot wait to go back to Kingdom of Dumpling, I won't be eating friend rice anywhere else from now on!  Worth the wait, worth the slightly steeper price than neighboring Chinese fare.", "author": "Emma H."}

Choice is yours but your preference may not be in stock.\n+ Each bag costs $6-7 for 20 pieces. Almost a negative factor since they used to throw in more bites in a bag and now have cut back.

Must buy in bulk to make it worthwhile\n- Cash only\n- Street parking only\n- Trader Joe sells a bag of chicken dumplings for $2.99 which makes it a more convenient and cheaper option than Kingdom of Dumpling\n- No sauces to buy upon checkout unlike its original location on Noriega which had offered dumpling sauces on their shelves\n\nTIP: Consider bringing an ice box or freezer bag to store your purchases.

On our list was Kingdom of Dumpling which many people claim has the best XLB in the city. \n\nWe ordered a whole slew of items, including the wings, lamb skewers, marinated beef, beef tendon, garlic green beans, chicken corn dumplings, beef pancake, XLB and fried XLB.\n\nI'm going to skip over most of it since in general most of it was average, except the wings which were below average. The fried XLB, which took an extra 30 minutes, were also average and not worth the wait. The steamed XLB were actually pretty damn good. I'm not sure if they're the best in the city as there are still many I need to try, but it was definitely one of the better ones.\n\nThe one item that I really loved though, was the beef pancakes. These were soooo good. Thick, filled with multiple layers of meat and perfectly soft yet crunchy, I ended up eating half the plate.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the spicy house sauce in the jars on the table. I couldn't get enough of this stuff. \n\nOverall, I really liked Kingdom of Dumpling.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-17", "description": "Widely lauded as one of the best places in San Francisco to get dumplings, Kingdom of Dumpling had been on my to-eat list for a while. Especially the Xiao Long Bao (a.k.a. XLB or soup dumplings). I was surprised by the tininess of the space. There were 5 tables of varying sizes, with room for no more than 30, the largest tables having room for no more than 8. On a Monday night, a line of at least 10 people waited outside for coveted seats. \n\nWe decided to get takeout. The servers were understandably busy. I didn't want to wait for too long, so I forewent the radish cakes (2 per order), which would take 30 minutes to prepare. Our order was ready in 10 minutes, and we quickly drove home to eat it as freshly as possible.\n\nThe XLB, as their \"signature dish,\" was amazing--flavorful, yet delicate. Still steaming when we got home, letting them cool down helped me not to burn my tongue upon first chomp. Beware of the spurting jizz effect if you bite into it (it helps to hold it on a big soup spoon). If you let them cool down TOO much, though, the broth may solidify back into its original gelatin form (which may happen if you do takeout, though it's probably not as much of a risk when eating in). \n\nTheir dumplings are packed wonderfully fat. I love the way they cook chives in their dumplings. The chicken wings are juicy, tender, and highly recommended, I would definitely order them again. If anything, I wish they were bigger. The wings are on the lighter side for wings--not breaded, more of a light basting as opposed to doused in sauce. The flavor is like a sweet soy sauce and not very deep fried. The garlic green beans and garlic bok choy are deliciously garlicky and covered in diced garlic bits that add tons of flavor. \n\nThe prices seemed extremely reasonable. It would be cool if they sold some of their dumplings for less than 12 pieces per dish (for the friend-challenged/smaller parties), but you know they'll get eaten eventually. \n\nThe Engrish name only adds to the appeal. My only regret: I didn't get to sample more dumplings. I know I'm coming back for more.\n\n*Sources: http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/340-the-best-chinese-dumplings-in-san-francisco \nhttp://tripque.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/food-challenge-best-soup-dumplings-%E5%B0%8F%E7%B1%A0%E5%8C%85-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area/\nhttp://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2014/05/who_makes_the_better_chinese_d.php", "author": "Jade V."}

Tons of rave reviews from friends and Yelpers alike, but they've both fallen short of admittedly lofty expectations.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling epitomizes \"hole in the wall\" being a tiny restaurant in the middle of a residential area in Parkside.  After church, my family and I were lucky enough to be free around the time these guys opened so we nabbed a table right away.  Otherwise, you'll have to put your name down on a list at the front and wait accordingly.\n\nGetting the misses out of the way first, skip the Scallion Pancake and Beef Tendon Noodle Soup.  The noodles were fine, but the tendon pieces were entirely fat and the broth was terribly bland.\n\nDumplings came in dozens with fillings including pork & Chinese spinach, pork & chives and lamb.  The skins were quite well done - not excessively thick and gummy, and the meat and veggies were fresh and seasoned well.  As for the infamous xiao long bao (XLB), pretty tasty with the juices and flavor being the strong points.  The skins were borderline too thin as some of them broke open, but most held up no problem.  Unfortunately, the pork filling was very skimpy and not nearly tender enough as you could notice the gritty texture.\n\nKoD looks to be an entirely family run establishment, so don't expect particularly speedy or efficient service.  Props for taking credit card on orders over $15 though.  So the key question: Would I come back?  Good, but not great and not quite worth the trek out for a return visit.

I came here New Years Day and I knew this place had to be open because it is an Asian restaurant and they are always open on a holiday. I called them around 12:30 to see how long the wait would be and they said it was 20 minutes. When I arrived, there was just a huge crowd outside and there were at least 15 names in front of mine. This place is friggin SMALL with only 10 tables or so and I understood why the wait was so long. Supposedly, it was only supposed to be a 20 minute wait when I asked again (it ended up being an hour wait since people just jotted their name down and never came back). My group had 7 people so it was pretty tough getting a spot but eventually we got two tables and pushed them together. By this time, it was awkwardly 3pm so it was definitely a linner. We walked down a few blocks to get Super Cue and sipped on boba and ate Taco Bell before lunch.....hahha. We walked back and our name was actually called but he still allowed us to be seated, which was really nice since I had just missed it.\n\nOur group of 7 ordered:\n-- 4 xiao long bao (6 pieces each)- I was slight disappointed in this because that was the whole reason to go here. The dumplings are pretty flat and piping hot but I thought it was pretty average. The tip was hard and the soup and meat wasnt extremely flavorful.\n\n-- 2 fried XLB (4 pieces each)- These are just huge xiao long baos that are fried and are supposed to still have soup but these just ended up being huge fried dumplings. The skin wasnt flavorful and the meat was dry.\n\n-- 1 green onion pancake- This was probably the most tasty item since you cant really mess up a fried pancake. I liked that it came in a lot of pieces and they were all fried. I hate when the pancake is squishy since they didnt fry it all the way. I would say this one is a must. \n\n-- 1 pork dumpling with corn (12 pieces)- I wanted to try something different and saw that this dumpling had corn. No one at my table liked this one but I thought it was alright. The corn is sweet so it didnt quite mesh well with the pork. Maybe you should just get the regular dumpling with spinach or leak. \n\n-- 1 beef noodle soup- This one was pretty disappointing since the soup and meat was whatever. The noodles were soft but I wouldnt crave this at all. I would pass. \n\n-- 1 green bean- The owner suggested we get more food so we ordered a 4th XLB and a green bean. This dish was alright and I guess we needed some veggies up in here. A lot of people get this but once again it is nothing special.\n\nThis place is a cute mom and pop shop but the food wasnt up to par with the rest of the SF cuisine. Good try though. I will say that the owner is a straight up playa balla status. He said we didnt have enough food and suggested we order more even though I thought we had more than enough. We ordered two more dishes and even though we finished everything, I am sure if those two dishes werent there, we would have been completely fine. In the end, I wasnt so full that I couldnt breathe and I left satisfied. I heard the owner go to two other tables and used the same like of Oh I dont think that is enough food and they ended up ordering more. He sure is a smoother talker that can sure sell his dumplings. We got trolled by his charm but I guess it was alright since the whole thing ended up being only $65 or so. The owner was so funny and every time we made a comment to each other about the taste or after we took a bite, he briskly walked by and joined our conversation and said \"Good job!\" or other random comments. Haha this guy. Overall the food is alright and I definitely want to try the other XLB places to compare.\n\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Parking isnt that bad over here so it should be fine to drive.\n2) This place is verrry small so expect a long wait and only bring a small group.\n3) Enjoy!", "author": "Amy H."}

My friend suggested Kingdom of Dumpling insisting that their dumplings were better so we gave it a shot. We came on a Friday night, but luckily the wait was minimal. After ten minutes in the wind, we were seated inside the cramped dinning room. We spent a few minutes deciding which items we would get on the menu but it took 15 minutes for them to take our order. We flagged down the waiter a few times but he told us to wait a minute. It seems like they were swamped with to go orders.\n\nWe ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork and cabbage dumplings, pork and chive dumplings, and beef chow fun. I had my heart set on the shanghai pan fried pork dumplings but they said it would take 45 min - 1 hr to make. Unless if they had to make it from scratched then and there or make it from frozen, I don't think it should take that long. Other places like Dumpling Kitchen whip it out within 10 minutes. They waiter asked if we ordered enough food and that we should make sure we order enough at the beginning, because we would probably have to wait an extra 20-40 minutes for a second order if we were still hungry. The fear of not having enough food caused us to order their fried chicken wings as suggested by the waiter.\n\nOur food came out 15 minutes later nice and hot. Unfortunately the taste didn't impress me too much. The skins of the dumplings didn't have a firm bite to them but rather a brittle feeling. The meat was nothing memorable and the soup of the soup dumpling was mild. The chicken wings were crisp, but the sauce didn't have a punch that would be expected.\n\nIn a nutshell: \n- The wait can be long \n- They prioritized to-go orders over taking dine in orders\n- Slow on fulfilling orders so make sure you order a good amount\n- Nothing really stood out and some dishes were a bit bland\n- The prices are affordable!", "author": "David C."}

This restaurant is only slightly bigger than a walk-in closet. The nondescript squared interior was stacked with small tables leaving very little elbow room for anyone to maneuver. The atmosphere was very festive as there was a long line of people waiting outside for a table. The servers seemed to be working on a frantic mode, and they were very kind to offer us hot tea as we looked on and drooled until seating became available for our group.\n\nWe shared Pork Dumplings with Corn (12/$6.95), Pork Dumplings with Spinach (12/$6.95), Shanghai Soup Dumplings/XLB (6/$4.95), Pork & Shrimp Dumplings with Chives (12/$6.95), Beef Stew Noodle Soup ($6.95), and String Beans ($6.95). Everything we had was outstanding and 5 stars quality. The ingredients that were used were fresh and the dumpling wrappers were spongy, flavorful, and came with a good bite. Excellent wrappers! The fillings were robust and not skimpy with the right balance of ingredients and great flavor. Furthermore, the Shanghai Soup Dumplings came with juicy squirts of flavorful broth until the rest of the steaming meaty dumpling collapse into the taste buds. From dumpling to dumpling, each bite was very consistent.\n\nI also enjoyed the Beef Stew Noodle Soup tremendously. The broth was light, flavorful and the thickness and texture of the noodles reminded me of the street vendors of Taiwan. I still prefer the same dish at Din Tai Fung, but I would not hesitate to order their Beef Noodle Soup again. As a string bean snob, I initially had under estimated this dish but it turned out perfect. The texture was stir fried to dry and there was wonderful flavor coming from the string beans itself. It was obvious that the chef knows a thing or two about the art of wok too in addition to their delicious dumplings. I was thrilled.\n\nI was torn between a 4 or 5-stars for the rating since I thought the service was very rushed and not attentive after our food arrived at the table. I also wished I could have more ginger to complement the soy sauce and dumplings, so those who are interested shouldn't expect too much from the service when dining here. Instead, their strength is at providing our group with taste and value that comes with a good price tag. All of us left the restaurant full and satisfied.

The place was hot, because it has no air conditioning. It was probably hotter in the kitchen.   I tried the lamb dumpling and beef pancake. Both were fabulous, I cannot think of anything bad about the dish.  The lamb dumpling was good, soft, tasty. The meat was good and fresh. The beef pancake was good. It looked like green onion pancake with beef dumpling stuffed in it.  It was tasty and filling. Service was slow, but friendly. It is a very popular place.  I look forward to trying out their other items.  \n\nIt is listed as the Top 100 Chinese restaurants in the United States in 2011 (Top 100 Local Favorite)  and 2010 (Top 100 Specialty Dish), according to the Chinese Restaurant News Magazine.

It was a bunch of food for an affordable price. Out of all the food we ordered, I would have to say that my favorites were the onion pancakes and the soup dumplings. All of their dumplings are well made, and I especially love their dumpling skins.

The one on Taraval?\nMOM: Yes, it's been there for a few years. \nME: I knew it!\nMOM: You've never been? I've been there about a bijillion times.\nME: *faints*\n\nWe went on a random weeknight, and there was a line out the door. Luckily, we got seated right away since it was only the two of us. Unluckily, since we were sitting by the door, the server got distracted by people walking in and spilled soy sauce all over our table. He didn't even notice the big pool of soy sauce until I pointed it out to him. Great service! (sarcasm intended)\n\nFood-wise, it was pretty good for the most part. The XLB had a nice seasoned filling, although I found them on the small side. The pan-fried buns were decent. I had high hopes for the beef stew noodle soup, but it was average. The broth didn't have great flavors and there were few pieces of beef. My favorite dish of the night was the chive box. Overstuffed with chives and ingredients and pan-fried. It was crunchy and delicious!\n\nBesides the small mishap, I can see why my mom's been here so many times! =D", "author": "Marti L."}

Was I being too harsh?\n\nBut a recent visit just reconfirmed my original review. The shanghai soup dumplings were good though the broth tasted a bit fatty. The other dumplings - vegetarian, pork with chives, shrimp, shanghai fried - were all good too but not great. 3.5 stars for the food though the value for money bumps that up to 4 stars.\n\nSo why just 2 stars? Weird weird service. They're super good about splitting up and combining tables to fit parties as they come and go. When we arrived we waited around 15-20 minutes for a table right next to the door. Fine. We can sit next to the open door on a cold night. No big deal. \n\nFirst guy who served us was super nice but also super pushy. He kept asking us if we wanted to order a specific dish while we were ordering. Like, we would ask \"can we have 2 orders of XLB?\" and he would reply \"how about the chicken with corn dumplings too?\". This happened several times. At the end he shook his head indicating he didn't think we ordered enough food. When we told him we would eat what we ordered then get more if we wanted that wasn't good enough. He kept pushing us to order more food and we had to again tell him that we would - later. Fine. Whatever. Pushy staff. We can live with this.\n\nAt some point our server leaves and we get another guy. We order some more dishes okay. But then we want to order the shanghai fried dumplings they tell us that they just ran out. Okay. So we order some other dumplings. After some time the shanghai fried dumplings come out to us (surprise!) but the other dumplings don't. We ask about the other dumplings and they say \"no more\" - which we take to mean they ran out. So then after some discussion at our table we pick out a different type of dumpling to order. Only to be told again \"No\". We were extremely confused so we asked if they meant they ran out. The guy practically yells at us \"No more orders. You have to leave. There are people waiting\". What? Even though we're ordering tons more food we can't stay and eat? How come we're the only ones being hustled out the door when there are people who've been sitting down as long as us?\n\nTotally rude. 2 stars. NOT GOING BACK.", "author": "Jean K."}

Everything was prepared fresh and came out piping hot. The Salt and Pepper Tofu could have used more consistent seasoning but the texture was perfectly crisp. All the dumplings were delicious! Great flavors in the pork dumplings and the shrimp and chive dumplings were subtle and tasty. For some reason even the green tea tasted extra good. Great low key food experience. \n\nI'd give four stars except for the waiter experience. We got there at 3PM: \n\nA very nice pregnant woman who knows the staff and may be part of the business noticed we weren't being acknowledged and got the waiter's attention. She was super sweet and apologetic. \n\nBeware any waiter there that tells you the kitchen is closing and if you want anything else better \"order now\" - when there's 30min before the kitchen closes. Our waiter wouldn't take no for an answer when he tried pushing all sorts of dishes on us. When I said I'd like to hold onto one menu, we may order something else in a few minutes - He said No, and took both menus away. We thought hmm, pretty hard core about closing the kitchen, but it's their kitchen so fair enough. \n\nAt 3:20 and 3:25 three more people were seated and placed orders! \n\nAfter that we felt like he delayed greeting us to shorten the time window so we'd feel pressured to order tons of dishes before the kitchen closed.  All he had to do was let us place our first round of orders, rather than act - admonishing - and take our menus away when we didn't order every dish he recommended. I was thinking of ordering food to go but not from that waiter and anyway he took the menu away. Silly. \n\nWe love tasty small local places and this is one of them.  \n\nThey are worth checking out! And the other staff seem to be more in tune with basic customer service. We're not looking for white glove treatment and I can tell that waiter is not a reflection of the rest of the business.

This is going to be good!\" The meal was indeed good, if not great. Every time I've gone, I've always ordered the same thing - pork and chive dumpling, XLB, and chive pancake. There was one occasion that we ordered the shrimp and chive too, which was good, but I am not much of a shrimp eater, so I can't say much on them. \n\nPeople say that dumplings in LA, specifically SGV, are better than here in SF -I beg to differ. I've been to the popular Mama Lu's and was impressed, but not where I thought the dumplings were superior. Yes, the skins are thicker at KOD, but the overall flavor I felt was better than that of ML's. I will say that ML's meat is processed and prepared better. Meaning, there isn't pieces of gristle that you occasionally find at KOD. \n\nThe dumplings always come out steaming hot and are tender. The orange chili sauce is like crack and I dip to my heart's fiery content. The chive pancakes are good here, although, I will say, that the outer skin is a bit too thick for this dish. Also, the pancakes aren't ever consistent. Sometimes they have a pronounced garlic and chive flavor, other times they have a more mild veggie taste, and the last time I got them they had a fishy taste to them :/ \n\nThe XLB are yummy!  They have great flavor and the filling is tender. However, I have had better tasting XLB at Shanghai Dumpling, but that's it from that place. Everything else I enjoy more at KOD. \n\nThe reason I gave three out of five stars is because this place needs to work harder on their consistency in flavor, refining the way they make their filling, and getting some ventilation in that place!  The window is always steamy, lol!", "author": "Josh S."}

I grew up eating and making dumplings with my grandma, and these dumplings at KoD are. For. Real.\n\nI can't even describe how good they are; they're perfect. When you enter this hot and muggy little restaurant, you'd never know it, but you're actually entering Dumpling Nirvana.\n\nMeditate while you bite into that pork and shrimp dumpling. Close your eyes and just focus on the plump, tender skin and the wonderful meaty filling while the crisp green onions and fresh shrimp pop in your mouth. Add some of that ginger and vinegar that they serve you before you even order, and some of that orange peppery hot sauce in an almost empty jar on the side, and it'll fly you to the moon.\n\n---\n\nEverything we ordered was around $5-$6, so we went all out:\n\n1) Green Onion Pancake - crispy, flaky, oniony, cut into 8 pieces, enough to share between two people. It's a simple appetizer, and they do it well.\n\n2) Five Spice Beef - a platter of thinly sliced, marinated beef. This is a very traditional homey Chinese dish that goes really well with the pancakes (think, Shandong beef rolls, basically). Really tender, moist, flavorful. Solid.\n\n3) Pork & Shrimp Dumplings - MY FAVORITE. I love that every dumpling had a good sized chunk of shrimp in it, and it tasted so fresh. The texture of the crisp veggies and the pop once you bite in to the shrimp, with the flavor of the pork. Just. Heavenly.\n\n4) Lamb & Green Onion Dumplings - This one was solid as well, but I don't think the lamb flavor really came through, it was more mushy in texture than the pork which holds together a little better.\n\n5) Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) - These were good, but not the best I've had. The skin is more akin to dumpling skins (too thick), tasty, but not what an XLB should be like. The soup is tasty and will coat your lips with its wonderful fattiness :) And the meat is good, but very basic. Order one just to try it, but I wouldn't come here just for these.\n\n---\n\nSo, if you don't mind circling a few blocks for parking and waiting for maybe 10 minutes outside to walk into a sauna with small sticky tables and little squeaky chairs and waving down a rather curt and sweaty server, you'll find a nice reward at the end of this ordeal once you have their AMAZING, PERFECT DUMPLINGS.\n\nAlso, just a note: Their new location at 2048 Taraval is \"to-go\" dumplings only, which means, they're DIY take-home-to-make dumplings, as in, you can't eat the dumplings there.

Those are bad choices and merely distractions on the road to dumplings, and that's probably how the owners feel, too.\n\nI came here on a saturday afternoon, and it was packed. My friends ordered dumplings and I ordered the special - prawns and eggplant. Theirs came out in 5-10 minutes. They were both done with eating their food items when mine finally came out. The owner was nice in letting me know that it took awhile, but when I asked if I could just take it to go, he kind of did one of those, \"ehh...\" like I couldn't take something to go. It felt like there was too much going on for them to accommodate someone who hadn't just ordered the dumplings.\n\nThe prawns and eggplant were meh. Kinda tasted like a little more flavorful thing you'd get at a Panda Express. The dumplings were delicious and fresh and pretty cheap.\n\nThe thing that's the worst is that to get to the bathroom, you have to go through their kitchen, which is small and full of people and boiling pots of water. I can't believe that's not illegal. This building was not designed to be a restaurant. I can see why they've got a 72/100 health code score.

Here is a breakdown of the stuff I get:\n\nAppetizers:\nCold wide bean noodle: it's one of those things you're like... What could this possibly be? It's this noodle made of mung beans and it's flat and chewy, kinda like a firmer rice noodle. It's doused with sesame oil, garlic, and packed with flavor. They're also topped with cucumber shreds for an excellent dish when it's hot out (or inside). \n\nSalt and pepper tofu: pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. They're tiny little morsels with lots of fried outer bits and only a dash of the salt and pepper flavor. If you're into that, then this is for you. I like bigger pieces with more flavor, but that's just my preference.\n\nDumplings:\nPork and Shrimp Dumplings with Chives: super delicious if you like chives! Also, it goes great with the habanero sauce that they have on the table (it's that orange thing) if you're into hot sauce. I've been trying to get them to bottle that stuff for years, but they won't do it. (Sad for me.) They make that sauce fresh every week, but I digress.\n\nShanghai Soup Dumplings: flavorful and soupy, but they come out super hot, so watch your tongue or you might get burned.\n\nVegetarian Dumplings: for friends that don't eat meat, I'd wish they put more variety in these dumplings, like ginger, woodear mushrooms, or shiitake mushrooms, but they mostly consist of cabbage. They're nice and crunchy though, and vegetarians won't complain about having a dumpling option. :)\n\nOther:\nGarlic string bean: the texture is firm and it's a staple every time I come. I will never come here to not get this. It's a mix of soy, garlic, and magic. It's delicious. If you ever look around the restaurant, you'll see that half of the people will order this.\n\nShanghai Donut: \nA light and flaky bun with sesame seeds on top, filled with ground up, sweet, black sesame filling. It's delicious and there's two in every order. One for you and one for a friend. The perfect snack to end the dinner!", "author": "Amy N."}

The wontons had a good taste and the wrapper was cooked just right.  The onion pancake wasn't memorable.  It had a few pieces of green onion here and there.  I dipped it into the hot sauce that was on the table.  Be careful.  It's tangy and very spicy!\n\nAs I finished my two dishes, I noticed that the table beside me had ordered the lamb skewers.

She obliged and said I would have to wait.  I was fine with that.  I brought the box of lamb skewers to my car and ate two skewers.  Oh, they were so delicious!

Having been spoiled by din tai fung, I wasn't sure what to expect from KoD. We pulled up right in front (RIGHT in front, yah, it deserves repeating :P) late on a Saturday night and were seated right away (in fact, we had our pick of tables). I knew as soon as we walked in that it was gonna be good - the decor is super simple, in that non-pretentious-we-only-care-about-food-here kinda way. THE BEST. \n\nNow the hard part... choosing. Xiao long bao - check. My eyes grew big as I read over green onion pancake. There is nothing that brings me home more than eating green onion pancakes. We ordered this (naturally), along with one order of the pork xiao long boa, garlic green beans, pork and cabbage dumplings, the beef onion pancake, and.... Roy C. - am I forgetting anything? I think that was it. Everything was super good but the onion pancakes and xiao long bao were most memorable. In comparison to din tai fung, i would say the flavor is on par - VERY VERY tasty, but the wrapper is way thicker (which I actually like better, cuz it reminds me of how my grandma and mom make it). The hot sauce on the table is way tasty. I also loved that the dumplings were boiled (which, IMO, is the best way to enjoy dumplings). Service is great, cost is very reasonable, and it's cute that the whole family works here. I even overheard the son complimenting his mom on her cooking.\n\nWHEN we return, I know exactly what to (re)order! Thanks for yet another amazing date Roy C.!", "author": "Corrina S."}

String bean with garlic is cooked perfectly with just the right amount of smokiness from the stir-frying action.  Chow mein with chicken wasn't what I expected, pretty similar if not the same as the chow mein they serve at Chinese fast food spots, but tasty nonetheless.  \n\nHomemade hot sauce is bomb, but also super garlicky...but also pretty spicy!

I guess this is a sign of how stereotypes still linger to this day. Tipping isn't something many Asian dinners do well, if at all.  50 cent tip on a $20 tab isn't uncommon for the elders in the community. But as a younger couple, who always tip 15% or more, it sucks to be lumped into the same group and as such get shitty service as a result.\n\nThe wait was long when we arrived, but that's usually a good thing. The restaurant was small and packed, so I understood.  After 15 minutes we were seated (luckily we came early, within those 15 minutes, 10 other parties showed up).\n\nWe had been perusing the menu posted on the door and we were ready to order.  Unfortunately, 1/2 of the items we wanted they couldn't make that day because there was only 1 chef. Ok, no big deal, being short staffed in the kitchen sucks.  So I ask the waitress, ok, can you give me a minute then to change my choices? \n\nShe stares daggers at me, huffs, then walks away. Wow, nice. I didn't see you do that to the table full of white people.\n\nFinally we decide, she comes back, we order a few items and say, we'll order more if this isn't enough.\n\nNO. YOU ONLY ORDER ONCE.\n\nOh really? How come that other table had you come back for a 2nd order.\n\nWhatever. She takes our order and walks back to the kitchen in her knock off \"Channel\" t-shirt.\n\n20 minutes later food comes out, again, no big deal, kitchen is understaffed, it'd be unreasonable to demand the food to come out faster. \n\nBut come on, for a place that's named KINGDOM of DUMPLINGS. You'd think they'd take some more pride in their dumplings.\n\n2/3rds of the shanghai soup dumplings had burst and all the soup had leaked out leaving a dry hunk of unseasoned meat. Wow.

I'm actually craving some more dumplings by just thinking about reviewing it right now. Unfortunately it's 10pm and they're already closed and a bit of a drive. We planned ahead and had a friend wait in line for us and the total wait for the 5 of us was around 40 minutes. We were kind of worried that we weren't going to be able to sit together because this place is SMALL! There are only 2 tables that can accomodate a group of 5 with about 6 other tables that are good for couples....so keep that in mind.\n\nThe server was hilarious and very jovial. He's making a lot of money from all the dumplings he's selling. I found it interested that a Lexus SUV rolled up delivering extra dumplings and I think they actually handmake all the dumplings offsite and bring it in...kind of odd I know! Did I mention this place was small? Standing outside in the rain you can just feel the hot air coming out of the restaurant. Plan on taking all your layers of clothes off when you sit down.\n\nThe food! Started off with the XLB and wasn't impressed at all. I compare all dumplings now to Mama Lu's in Alhambra and this place just doesn't even compare. The XLB are small and the skins were all irregular shaped and didn't really hold their soup at all. The string beans were good and I would prefer getting that over the cucumber. My favorite variety would probably be the pan friend dumplings. They were the largest and the most flavorful. The beef noodle soup was also pretty good but wish the noodles were the thicker kind. The noodles served here almost reminded me of ramen.\n\nAll in all, I think the place is good. At least this place isn't called \"King of Dumpling\" because that would be a misnomer...but Kingdom of Dumpling is a fitting name and I'll definitely come back when I have to get my dumpling fix.

I had been hyping this place up to them so much that they thought I gave them unrealistic expectations but they soon understood why I love this place so much.\n\nFirst off, get the xiao long bao. Don't even look at the menu, just start off ordering that. They will be some of the best XLB that you'll ever have. On top of that we had some pork and celery dumplings (my mom is oddly obsessed with celery) and they were delicious as well.\n\nGet the scallion pancakes as well, won't go wrong. The jellyfish is the best jellyfish that I've ever had - and I've had a lot. Black fungus with garlic was also amazing. The cilantro bean noodle was incredible! I had never had it before but now it is something that I will be coming here for.\n\nThe place is really small, so make sure to be either prepared to wait for a table or a really small place. They don't have many tables, so if you have to wait, just wait! It well be well worth it!\n\nFor the more adventurous, get the pigs ears. Now, I love pigs ears already. It's a great snack to pick up from chinatown when you need a snack and it's one of my dad's favorite treats. My mom, sister and boyfriend all think we're insane. Well not anymore! They all tried the pigs ears and loved them! So don't go \"ew, you're so weird, I don't trust this girl because she eats pigs ears\", just order them, eat them and you can thank me later.

Because I want my dumplings now! Sorry, I'm all about instant gratification. Call me spoiled. Sigh....unfortunately, the wait time is the only thing that keeps me from returning on a regular basis. Because Kingdom of Dumpling is incredibly popular and only seats about 25 people max, waiting to have some dumplings requires lots of time and patience. Fortunately, if you do make it inside and have the opportunity to try their fresh, handmade dumplings, you will not be disappointed. These are some of the best dumplings I've had in the Bay Area (other than my mama's kitchen).    \n\nTwo of my cuzzos live within walking distance to the Kingdom. We strolled down Taraval on a Saturday around 1pm for a late lunch. Of course, the Kingdom was packed inside and had a few groups of people waiting outside. There is no room to even wait inside. That is how small the place is. We put our names down on the list and waited on the sidewalk. Girl talk ensued for about 40 minutes. As we watched happy patrons leave sporadically, our hopes got higher and higher. Finally, our turn came to go inside and we were seated by the door. It was super cramped and warm in there and you can definitely smell the hot grease coming out of the kitchen. Every time someone opened the door, the door would hit the back of my chair. But all was forgiven because cuzzos and I were on this mission to consume some dumplings. \n\nWe ordered the shanghai soup dumplings (xao long bao), pork and chive dumplings and the salt and pepper tofu. The dumplings looked amazing and were so delicious!  The pork stuffing on both dumplings had great flavor and the handmade dumpling wrappers were the perfectly thin, not too doughy. The salt and peper tofu was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Yummy! One of my cuzzos even got another dumpling order to go for her husband at home. \n\nThe prices are super affordable.

Just come when you're hungry and hope there's not a long wait.\n\n---\n\nMy mom is from NE China (aka. home of fat dumplings and tall women), so I've literally had dumplings as soon as I could eat solid food. During Chinese New Year, my mom used to go to the bank to exchange completely new coins to be added to the filling and randomly wrapped into dumplings. The people who get the coins in their dumplings during the big family dinner is supposed to have a prosperous new year :)\n\nKingdom of Dumpling (KOD for short) is quite good, on par with Prosperity Dumpling in NYC if you've ever been there. They have a lot of variations so you'll probably find something you like.\n\nI love the cabbage and pork dumpling here - it's well balanced and perfectly seasoned. Napa cabbages usually emit a lot of water when cooked so even my mom's cabbage/pork dumplings tend to be soggier when she makes them, but you don't really find that at KOD. They're just perfect bursts of flavor and joy here :)\n\nIf you want a more nuanced taste, just replace cabbage with chives. Note they're not the western chives that you see on top of smoked salmon sometimes. Chinese chives have a stronger flavor, kind of like a mild green onion - it's great, try it! There, I've described for you the two big Chinese dumpling staples - cabbage and chives.\n\nOf course, depending on your dietary habit you could swap pork out for shrimp or chicken or even beef/lamb. I don't think I've ever tried a beef dumpling at KOD but their lamb dumplings were a surprising let-down (actually kind of bland). Their shrimp one is also good (although still a stretch from the pork IMO), if you want to switch things up a bit.\n\nOne of the things that I didn't discover until my 5th or 6th visit here is their GARLIC STRING BEANS. I'll just leave it at that and leave you to discover for you its greatness. We had to get two orders of that because it was just so good. The baby bok choy is a milder version of the string beans (and less oily :P), just FYI.\n\nIf you come by yourself, I'd recommend getting a boiled dumpling, another type of dumpling*, and you're good to go. It'll come out to about $15, but you'll feel great after washing everything down with a pot of tea :)\n\n* other dumpling assessments:\nXiao Long Bao - they have the funniest shaped XLBs I've ever seen...they're shaped like little turrets. They're not bad, but they're also not ridiculously good. Try it once and decide if you want to keep getting it - it's good to switch things up a bit and have a steamed dumpling though.\n\nPan-fried versions - a hot oily griddle + dumpling is a match made in heaven\n\nor you can also just get another order of boiled dumpling. or two. ;)\n\nps. The wait can be kind of long at lunch/dinner rush hours so try to come at an off time if you can. It'll save a lot of waiting since the restaurant is really small and there's no covered area to wait.

We had previously been to Dumpling Kitchen during an earlier visit and I was excited to see how this compared.\n\nWhile standing outside waiting, I was noticing all of the accolades the restaurant has received (articles posted in the window, etc.)  When they opened, we were the first to be seated and we waited about 10 minutes before anyone came over to take our order, even though our menus had been put down on the table 5 minutes earlier.\n\nWe ordered:\nShanghai Dumpling (2 orders)\nPork and Napa Cabbage Dumpling\nCrispy Chicken Wings (because they told us the Green Onion Pancake was unavailable)\n\nThe Shanghai dumplings arrived first and I noticed the skins at the bottom were very thin and fragile such that they would break when trying to pick the dumpling up.  This resulted in the loss of all of the liquid which was not a good thing.  Also, the tops of the dumplings had large amounts of dough where the dumpling was sealed.  Some of these \"knots\" at the top didn't taste fully cooked.\n\nThe Pork and Napa Cabbage dumplings arrived next.  They were good, but nothing spectacular.  Seemed to me to be run of the mill.\n\nThe Crispy Chicken Wings arrived third and although they didn't look all that crispy, there was a slight crunch to the skins.  The sauce was pretty tasty, but again, nothing spectacularly out of this world.\n\nWe finished up most of the food and were chatting when another Pork and Napa Cabbage dumpling plate was delivered.  We let them know we didn't order it and they took it away.  After that, a Green Onion Pancake arrived.  Apparently after they told us they didn't have any, they decided to put the order in anyway.  The gentleman that brought it out told us that it takes 30 minutes to prepare, but had we known that we were going to get the pancake, we would not have ordered the chicken wings.\n\nThey removed the pancake from our bill and we paid and left.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the food and service.  I'm guessing all of the accolades had led to laziness and the food and service that had brought them all of the awards no longer exists.

I am not really a big fan of soup dumplings in general so can't say much about that but the dumplings here are so delicious. I like how it is small and is perfectly wrapped. The owner of the place would usually walk around and make sure everything is okay. The place is very, very small but you can get a table when you come during off times like at 2-4.

We were already on Taraval and stumbled upon Kingdom of Dumpling and the little hole-in-the-wall piqued our interest.  Already pressed for time, we decided to drop in for their popular xiao long bao.\n\nThe prices were totally reasonable so we decided to go sick and order 4 dishes.  These included the xiao long bao (of course), the pork and cabbage wonton noodle soup, some pork dumplings, and the saut\u00e9ed green beans in chili paste.  The xiao long bao had more soup and a thicker skin than I'm used to but had great flavor.  They only came 6 to an order and were a tad more expensive than other places, but are definitely something you have to order here.  The wonton soup was super refreshing on the cold night and the green beans were really tasty too. The other dumplings were just so-so in my opinion and seemed to lack its own definitive flavor.  I guess I was just looking for something different.\n\nOverall, the food here was very good.  Everything was clearly homemade and I've never seen the shape of xiao long bao they do here anywhere else.  It was definitely a great experience and I look forward to coming back.\n\nFood: 8/10\n\nService: 7/10\n\nPrice: $$\n\nAtmosphere: 7/10", "author": "Joe M."}

While we're not fond of crowds or lines, it's usually a good sign at a restaurant. Also a good sign - all of the patrons were Chinese (points to the food being authentic). \n\nWe were seated soon enough. It was chilly outside, yet the kitchen made the dining room feel like the inside of a furnace. Thank goodness I dressed in layers. \n\nThe owner, managed the room with the theatrical flourish of a ringmaster, and alternated between greeting people, seating people, and taking orders. Since he was so busy, when you're ready to order, you have to be assertive to get his attention. When placing your order, stand tough. No matter what you've already decided on, he'll attempt to cajole you into also ordering an extra appetizer or one of their other specialties. My husband and I weren't prepared for the onslaught, and I'll sheepishly admit we ended up ordering 6 dishes between the 2 of us (lotsa leftovers!). I've listed them below FROM BEST TO WORST.\n\n1) STEAMED XIAO LONG BAO - This is what we came for, and they didn't disappoint.  The hot, juicy little buns had just the right balance of meat and fat. The wrapping could stand to be thinner, but then I'm holding them to a high bar against the likes of Ding Tai Fong.\n \n2) SESAME PANCAKE WITH STEWED BEEF - Just like what I ate at home growing up. My husband couldn't get enough of this. Word to the wise: if you like spice, try it dipped it in their secret hot sauce. \n\n3) GRILLED LAMB SKEWERS - This is apparently a popular street food in Beijing. Smoky cumin is the standout flavor and the meat itself is really tender. But I didn't like the occasional mouthful of fat. I would have been happy eating 1 skewer, no more.  \n\n4) GARLIC STRING BEANS - These were yummy, but nothing special.\n\n5) PORK, SHRIMP, AND CHIVE DUMPLINGS - For a place called Kingdom of Dumpling, I had high expectations. However, ours were overcooked. Several of the skins had broken apart and were mushy to the bite. The saving grace was that the few intact ones had a good amount of juice, like in the xiao long bao. \n\n6) PORK & CHINESE SPINACH WONTON SOUP WITH WIDE RICE NOODLES - Uber bland. We ordered this because many other patrons had ordered it. Big mistake. The broth was straight up chicken broth. The wonton skins were mushy and as flavorless as the broth.\n\nAll in all, the dishes were a little hit or miss and I didn't care for the up-selling, especially when we already had too much food. However, I would consider coming back some day.", "author": "Cindy T."}

A small sign hangs on top of the entrance to the tiny room meant to fit no more than about 20 people. Yet at 10am on Sunday morning, it already has a waiting list. \n\nEverything is made with fresh ingredients and by hand. The people behind the dishes and dumplings have been making them for generations, so they know what they're doing. If you take a peek in the back room where all the magic happens, you will see a scene out of a typical Chinese dumpling store, with each dumpling carefully hand crafted.\n\nOn to the food:\n\n- Lamb Dumplings: Phenomenal. You just can't go wrong with a lamb dumpling. Juicy and flavorful just how they should be.\n\n- Vegetable Potstickers: We had to get this for the vegetarians in the group, but I still got a try. These are filled with delicious vegetables goodness and grilled to perfection. The perfect dish for a vegetarian here.\n\n- Stuffed Green Onion Pancakes: I'm used to cooking the ones they sell at Ranch 99, but the ones here surpassed those in quality. I didn't even know you could stuff them in the first place. The filling here seems to be with veggies and egg, which combine together wonderfully.\n\n- Egg Rolls: Pretty standard, yet still delicious. Nothing to complain about.\n\n- Beef Noodle & Beef Tendon Soup: This was for the two ladies who suffered the worst hangover, and everyone knows soups are a perfect hangover cure, which is why Pho is typically the #1 choice. I didn't get to try too much of them, but I remember the broth as being very delicious and the soups were packed with hefty chunks of meat. \n\n- Lamb Skewers: Although a bit spicy, these were unforgettable. I'm a sucker for anything lamb, especially on a skewer. These were marinated, thoroughly grilled, and just overall delicious. Many American places tend to screw up lamb, but that was definitely not the case here.\n\nHow does such a small place attain almost 1000 reviews and such a high rating? Come by and see.

And after a while of my full stomach growling at me, I spent a good amount on the toilet. Yay for unwanted bowel movements.\n\nSecond stomach churning experience: Because I LOVED this place so much and it had done me right before, I had to BEG my boyfriend to come back to this place again because he had endured the same thing as me from our first bad experience. Reluctantly, hungry, and grumpy, he agreed. I love it when I win! :) Little did I know that everything was going to go horribly wrong. \n\nWe ordered less than normal: chicken wings, string beans, soup dumplings, and a noodle soup. Here's the order of which everything came out: string beans... noodle soup..... and soup dumplings. Why the hesitation? Because it took forever for each dish to come out. Are we really going to scarf down string beans first as an appetizer? No, you have to wait to pair it with something else! Not very good to pair it with soup, either. Oh what happened to our chicken wings? They NEVER CAME OUT. We finished our entire dinner and couldn't wave down anyone for a refill on our water. They walked back and forth, right passed us and ignored us every time we said \"excuse me.\" We were sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN DOOR. \n\nIt took the waitress 10 min to finally come over (after we were done with our meal). We asked for the check and told them we no longer want the wings. She had panic in her eyes. She literally took two steps back and stuck her head into the kitchen (this is how close we were) and said, \"hey, hurry up with the wings.\" Yeah, that's right. I'm chinese. I understand you. She told us that it will be right out. We had to argue with her for 5 minutes that we just want the check because we already finished eating. *arguing in the kitchen* Check comes out minus the wings that failed to fly. What a bad feeling in our stomachs. We realized a little later, yep, it's LITERALLY a bad feeling in our stomach and we spend the night on the toilet again. #notwinning Finally scarred for life, I had to let go of my favorite (& overhyped) dumpling place. \n\nAbout a year later, I finally gave another dumpling place a shot- it's literally one block down.

As we came later in the day, we were seated within several minutes.\n\nFOOD:\n*XLB (3 orders): YUMMY! The XLB was perfectly bundled in its wrapper and steamed. The wrapper was a little thicker in texture than the ones from Shanghai Dumpling King, so it was a lot more sturdy and didn't fall apart and/or rip when you picked it up. The savory soup was bursting with flavor and the pork filling was moist, tender, and very flavorful. The accompanying soy vinegar ginger sauce was a perfect complement as it gave a salty, sweet, and tangy punch to the XLB.\n\n*Pan-fried XLB: Good! This XLB's wrapper was thicker and resembled and tasted more like a mini pan-fried pork bun. The wrapper was nice and crisp on the bottom and soft in the center. The pork filling was similar to the steamed XLB and was still moist and very flavorful despite not having the soup in it.\n\n*Beef Pancake: OMG--SOO GOOD! Who doesn't like a beef cake?!?! Lol! It was essentially a triple layer of a thin, crisp pancake filled with two thin flavorful beef patties. Their homemade creamy garlic chili sauce was a perfect complement to the pancake.\n\n*Green Chive Pancake: It was good! This was basically a chinese version of a pita wrap. The pancake was crisp and a nice doughy texture to it and was generously stuffed with a green onions and QQ noodles (clear vermicelli noodles). All the flavors were really subtle, so you must dip it on the garlic chili sauce.\n\n*Pork w/ Napa Cabbage Dumplings: GOOD! The dumplings wrapper was slightly thicker than a wonton wrapper and was al-dente. The pork filling was very moist, juicy, and flavorful. It went very well with the soy vinegar ginger sauce.\n\n*Shrimp and Chive Dumplings: It was just ok. The same wrapper was used as the pork dumpling. There was more chive than anything, so I didn't really taste the shrimp.\n\n*Shrimp and Pork Wonton Soup w/ Wide Noodles: Perfect hangover food! The wontons were perfectly cooked leaving an al-dente skin; the filling which was mainly pork was moist and flavorful. The broth was DELISH and was definitely very pure; none of that MSG killer. The wide noodles (chow fun) noodles were cooked al-dente which gave it a nice bite. \n\n*XO Beef Chowfun: YUM! Although I didn't taste any components of XO sauce (dried scallop, fish, shrimp, chili paste, garlic, and etc), it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The noodles were al-dente and wasn't too oily. The beef was tender and flavorful, although there very few pieces of it. The bean sprouts and green onions gave it a nice crunch and freshness to the dish.\n\nPRICES:\n*Apps (i.e. pancakes): $3.95-$4.95\n*Dumplings (4-12 pieces): $4.95 to $6.95\n*Noodle soups/Noodle Dishes: $5.95-$6.95\n\nWe ordered 10 dishes among 4 people (yes, our eyes were and always BIGGER than our stomachs) and it came to $20/person including tip and we had leftovers to feed another 3 people.\n\nSERVICE:\nPretty good for a hole-in-the-wall. The manager/owner (?) was very friendly and even demonstrated on how to properly eat a XLB. Initially, they sat us at the back table near the kitchen which reeked of vinegar and he gladly let us move to another table when another party had left.\n\nThe first dish came out in 5-7 minutes and each dish after than came out in 4-5 min increments.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nKOD is epitome of a hole-in-the wall. It's tiny and can accommodate about 20-24 people. The sticky tables are very close to each other, so don't be surprised if the table next to you bumps you with their chair. The place does reek of pungent vinegar, but you get use to the smell within 10 minutes or so.\n\nPARKING:\nSince it's located in Outer Sunset/Parkside, street parking is a little easier to come by than the Inner Sunset. But, nonetheless, do expect to circle around especially during peak lunch hour.\n\nKOD, I *bow down* to you!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I was really surprised that Kingdom of Dumplings was rated so high on Yelp, yet the overall satisfaction we had at the end of our meal was little to none.  This is a legit hole in the wall with six small tables and a wall blocking off the kitchen area.  There's no cash register to go to since it's possibly behind that wall.  The cleanliness of the kitchen is questionable from the small glimpse that you get if you're sitting near the kitchen.  \n\nPlace was stuffy as hell with no ventilation with the exception of the front door being open.  Four workers there: two at a table kickin' it, one sitting outside and the fourth playing on his phone.  When we walked there was no greeting, just pointed a finger to the table we were expected to sit at.  The young gentlemen tossed two pieces of paper on the table (their menu) and set out two cups with tea. \n\nAfter a few moments he walked up to us as if he didn't even want to be there, dragging his feet along with a notebook and pen in hand.  I ordered the green onion pancake and the second order was the wonton soup.  I asked for water, which was probably a bad idea since the water tasted like faucet water and accompanied with two pieces of ice.  \n\nThe onion pancake was alright.  Nothing too dazzling about it just the same as the soup.  After we were done, we had no idea where to pay our bill since there was no register in sight and the workers now talking to each other not paying attention to anything other than themselves and the fourth texting away.

Here is what I ordered on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nXiao Long Bao (6 pieces) $4.95: I like XLB to have a very think layer of skin. This was sooo thick that it was not soupy inside if you let it sit there past 5-10mins! I picked one up right away, punctured a hole in it, poured the soup onto my soup spoon.... it had tons of soup! I was excited and love the first XLB! Then 2-3 mins later, I picked up another XLB and it had half the soup as the first one. 7-10 mins after receiving our XLB, I picked up one more and this one had no soup at all! I am sad that the thickness of the XLB skin soaked up the soup inside of the bao just after 10 mins of getting it! http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f5sicAwCzSC11yFAdmoREQ/l.jpg\n\nPork with chives dumplings (12 pieces) ~$6: this was really good, this was actually the reason why I didn't make this place two stars.

But Kingdom of Dumpling just didn't cut it for the three of us.\n\nWanting to eat somewhere near my friend's pad and slightly craving Asian food, we came here as it had pretty high ratings and seemed to be packed with people whenever we had walked or driven by. We came by around 1 pm on a Monday and there was only one table dining. The restaurant is incredibly small, able to seat 9-10 parties, as well as incredibly hot inside. We were quickly seated and given menus. The three of us decided to share xiao long bao, shen jien bao, and beef noodle soup.\n\nWe should've known not to order BNS in a restaurant owned by mainlanders as the Taiwanese make the best, but I figured why not; it can't be that bad. I was right, it wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't delicious. Edible at best. The soup was filled with mushrooms, something I've never seen in BNS, and the aroma of it was way too strong. The XLB were okay. I've had better at even the worst places in LA. The skin was thick and the soup was barely existent. Definitely wouldn't order again. The best thing was probably the shen jian bao, but even then, that's really not saying much.\n\nBy the time we left, there were four other parties dining and they were all non-Asian. I'm convinced most of the rave reviews are written by people who weren't raised on authentic Chinese and Taiwanese food. With that said, come here for a quick Chinese food fix if you're in the area, but don't expect anything spectacular.", "author": "Ivy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-13", "description": "Kingdom of Dumpling can't figure out what kind of Chinese restaurant it is. Is it Shanghainese? Is it Northern? Is it Cantonese? Is it Taiwanese? The staff are no help. They range from speaking Cantonese to Mandarin with a Taiwanese accent.\n\nThe food reflects this confusion. We ordered the beef noodle soup (an obsession of mine that I must try at every place that offers it), soup dumplings, pan-fried soup dumplings, fried chicken wings and 5-spice marinated beef.\n\nThe beef noodle soup was bizarre. The beef was tender and cut in the traditional Northern \"red roast\" style. The bok choy is also very Northern. But the noodles reminded me of the kind used in Cantonese dishes and the broth was nothing more than salty stock mixed with more salt and maybe a drop of soy sauce. Seriously, where was the rich beef flavor? Where were the traditional seasonings like garlic and chili peppers? It was obvious the beef had not been stewing in the broth for hours as it typically should be. This dish felt as confused as an in-bred dalmatian.\n\nThe XLBs were terrible. First off, the skins were way too thick. Guys, you don't make soup dumplings with such thick skins. You know why? Because the soup will inevitably get absorbed by all that flour leaving none for the filling. And that's exactly what happened. Half the soup dumplings had no soup. The other half had a pitiful amount. I've had some pretty mediocre xiao long baos over the years, but even the worst of those had a full dumpling of soup in them.\n\nThe pan-fried soup dumplings were exactly like the regular ones except slightly crispier. If soup was meant to be in them, it had certainly dissipated. The 5-spice marinated beef tasted like one spice and the cuts were really chewy, not soft and tender like they should be.\n\nI refuse to believe that these are the best xiao long baos in the city. That's just too sad a thought to accept. So I will continue to search for the city's best soup dumplings. I guess the only positive thing about this experience is that if you start really low, you have nowhere to go but up.", "author": "Josephine L."}

It looks similar to the green onion pancake but filled with delicious grinded up beef in the middle.  The beef pancake was very flavorful and has become a must order for us.\n\n*Shanghai Dumplings - MMMMM... The skin is not thick, but sturdy enough to pick up the dumpling without the broth spilling out.  I will admit, the meat is okay, but the dumplings are probably the best I've had in the city.  A vinegar soy sauce with ginger slices is provided to dip your dumplings in.\n\n*Pork & Shrimp Wonton - The won ton is delicious and flavorful and comes with wide rice noodles (hof fun), greens, and mushrooms.  The broth provides the perfect hangover cure (trust me, I speak from experience).\n\n*Pork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage - Yummy!  They're similar tasting to the Shanghai dumplings, but wrapped differently.  The pork/cabbage combo was delicious and the insides were juicy.\n\n*Beef Dumplings - Another must order!  Although it doesn't sound so appealing, the minute I bit into it, I loved it.  The dumpling is flavorful and juicy inside.\n\n*Pan Fried Shanghai Dumplings - It was okay, not what I was expecting.  I expected a dumpling similar to a potsticker but found it was more like a bun and it didn't contain the broth in the middle.\n\n*Pork Potstickers - It was fried very well but a tad on the greasy side.

I could have eaten all four pieces by myself - yum\n\nSpicy Green Beans: Like other yelpsters - the kitchen prepared this with just amount of spice, sauce and best of all \"crunch\" of the beans. This was another winner for all of us.\n\nKeep in mind, the other couple had previously had the above items many times before so it helped to be able to try their favorites.\n\nWith that being said, even though they were in a rush to clear the remaining tables and close, the server was very nice and later explained that on Monday thru Thursday they close at 9:30 with Friday and Saturday - closing at 10 pm. KOD is like everyone says - is a very tiny hole in the wall place with being able to seat approx. 25 people.

First off, you'll notice how small the space is, there's about 8 small tables (made for 2-4) in this place and the kitchen is separated from the dining area by a small wall.  I'm sure on busier days it can get pretty steamy in there.\n\nWe were seated right away and were brought tea.  I already knew what I wanted to order, XIAO LONG BAO (soup dumplings).  But they definitely had an extensive menu.  In addition to the xiao long baos, we also ordered pork and chive dumplings, spicy beef tendon & beef pancakes.  I really wanted the sheng jian baos (soup dumplings, but FRIED), but was told those would take 30 minutes, I was really disappointed; those are even rarer to come by in the states than xiao long baos.\n\nAfter ordering, we were given small sauce bowls of vinegar & ginger (?).  And our food came out in about 5 minutes, the chive and pork dumplings took the longest to come out, about 10 minutes.  The beef tendons were tasty - thinly sliced tendon, and it wasn't too spicy at all.  The pork and chive dumplings were good as well, I enjoyed them.  The xiao long baos were definitely the stars of the meal, delicious, a must if you come!  The beef pancakes definitely filled me up, pan-fried and huge. My friend and I couldn't even finish it, but that was probably we stuffed ourselves full of dumplings first.  And the hot sauce is definitely spicy, so beware!\nTook me a while, but I finally made it to Kingdom of Dumplings, and I'm so glad that I did.

Sure, the dumpling was steaming hot. Sure, the soup was simple, flavorful, and not oily. Sure, the meat and vegetables inside were smoothly grounded. \n\nBut the most important part of the dumplings, the skin, was just plain MEH. The skin is supposed to be very thin so that you can taste the meat and the soup inside the dumpling, and allow you to easily take a bite into the dumpling to get a bite full of skin-meat-veggies-soup. But the skin was very dough-y and a bit too thick, making it hard to chew the dumpling, and allowing me only to get an unsatisfactory bite of just plain skin.\n\nThe pork & Chinese spinach dumplings were actually better than the xiao long bao, maybe because the skin was less dough-y. The green chives pancakes were not worth it. They gave you a lot of onions, which was nice, but the outer skin was too crispy to the point it seemed like it was overcooked, and the whole thing was just dripping with oil.\n\nTotal bill came out to be a little over $20 which is very cheap, but I wouldn't come here for the xiao long bao only, which is what they're famous for.\n\nTip: \n- Very small restaurant, so come early! I went on a Saturday night at 6:15 and there was no line at all!\n- NO PARKING. Must find street parking! \n- They DO have take-outs, so maybe that could be another option to beat the long line.", "author": "Evelyn S."}

The beef stew noodle soup was decent, although we thought the broth could have been hotter.  \n\nAnd now the main event...LET\"S GET READY FOR DUMPLINGS!!!!!  Let just say we were not disappointed one bit.  The xiao long bao was probably one of the best I've had in the whole Bay Area.  They were hot and juicy.  Some may think it's a little greasy, but who cares?  The two orders of boiled dumplings (pork/chive and pork/shrimp/chive) carried some well balanced flavors.  Some may think there's not enough meat in the dumplings, but to me the meat/chive ratio is proportionate.  We also had an order of sheng jian bao (pan fried).

The restaurant itself is tiny, literally \"hole in the wall\". Seats comfortably 20 people, but each table has a third chair which the occupancy can go up to maybe 30. Low ceilings and you'll smell like the kitchen once you leave. \n\nWe ordered the Shanghai dumplings and onion pancakes. The dumplings didn't take that long to come out but once they did, I was excited to try them. Ugh, first bite was a disappointment. The meat didn't taste fresh, the dough was doughy and flavor was flavorless. Good amount of soup in each dumpling though. Whole time I'm sitting there, I'm just thinking \"why does this place have high Zagat review?\" \"why do Yelpers give this 5 stars?\" I don't get it. After we chowed down our order of dumplings, we waited another 20 mins for the darn onion pancake. It felt like a lifetime. We asked the waiter a few times where it was and his response was it's coming, it's coming. I asked for the bill and he said it's coming. UGH! Well it finally came, and yum it's good. It tastes much like the Burmese Palatha but with onions.

I'm a fan of their restaurant but the size of the place makes it hard to snag a seat! \n\nI just picked up a bag of their pork and chive dumplings (juicy, amazing $6.49/bag) and chicken with Napa cabbage dumplings (clean flavor, good cabbage taste $6.99/bag). I also picked up a sleeper hit: the beef pancake (huge $3.49). I pan fry and steam dumplings according to others who have posted on the method. For the pancake, I put the hefty frozen disc on a hot, well oiled cast iron and let it go then flipped it when it started to puff at the edges. The result was a deliciously beefy, thick two layered pancake that was crispy brown on the outside and juicy inside. \n\nThe service here is very helpful, attentive and sweet.

It was really good food, but the ingredients in each item we got were very simple and to be honest, lacked a bit in flavor.\n\nTheir wings weren't exactly crispy, they were very tender and delicious, with a semi-sweet glaze. Typical \"Asian\" style wings though.\n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings were pretty good. Very traditional taste and flavors. However not as soupy as I'm used to. In fact some of the ones I got were a bit dry.\n\nLast were the pork and chives dumplings.

First the service.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night at around 8-8:30pm. We got there and there was a little bit of a wait, maybe 10 minutes so it went pretty quickly. We got seated, decided what to order, and it took us around 10 minutes to get our order in. Normally at any other restaurant I've been to, a long wait time between getting seated and getting our order in was due to a combination of the restaurant being busy, understaffed, or the waiters not up-to-par. However the only guy taking orders in the restaurant was very, very polite and courteous, and even though it took us a while to get our order, he kept reminding us that he was trying to get our order in, but had to take a phone order or seat some people. I thought that was a really nice gesture by him since it didn't make us feel neglected at all.\n\nSecondly, the dumpling wrappers. Normally dumpling wrappers I've gotten in restaurants have been the pre-made ones, where they're kind of dry, tough, and very thin. That was not the case here. These dumpling wrappers definitely looked, felt, and tasted homemade. They reminded me exactly of the dumpling wrappers I would make with my family, and that's really what made the experience here much more enjoyable.\n\ni would definitely recommend this place, and when I'm in town I'll definitely be coming back.", "author": "Andy C."}

I told her I didn't want to even touch the rest of the dumplings on my order of my vegetarian dumplings out of fear that I would bite into another dead animal. She looked at them and said the rest of them looked vegetarian. Seriously? I asked for a glass of water. She took her time in returning.

The only thing that is good here is the Shanghai soup dumplings (XLB), but they'd run out by the time we tried to order more. That should not happen at a dumpling place--especially one where you must wait 20 minutes in the freezing SF cold for (there's no seating for waits here). The shop is incredibly small and cramped, so that doesn't help either.\n\nHere's what we had:\nXLB: (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IwJAd9MzoqgOng2uZC8LEw/l.jpg). Yummy, juicy. Skin could be more delicate, but that's the hardest part it seems.\nPork dumplings: (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BKQ2nkWT_RT5Tks0g8Y-tA/l.jpg) We tried pork and napa cabbage dumplings, and pork and chive dumplings. The skin was too thick and not chewy enough, and the filling was quite bland.\nGreen onion pancake: (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hwIfHaXVE-JG5uly9kimWg/l.jpg) I liked the texture of this (thin and slightly crisp), but it was seriously bland. Needed more salt and flavor.\nBeef noodle soup: (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lBaY3e9LFM50koN1vSjkTw/l.jpg). The noodles weren't particularly good (lacked chewiness). The broth and beef were decent. This was okay. Again, a little bland.\n\nVerdict: The XLB is worth coming here for, but make sure that they actually have it when you get here. The other dishes are incredibly bland, even for someone like me who is partial to lighter tastes.", "author": "K W."}

That's quite an ironic name because this is the absolute definition of a hole-in-the-wall: sticky wobbly tables, old beat-up chairs (minimum amount of seating might I add), closet-like bathroom in the back passed the kitchen, and their one of a kind overwhelming pungent smell of vinegar once you enter. Some eateries in Chinatown got it better than this! Anywho, my friends and I came here the other day because we heard word of amazing Shanghai Dumplings, which is quite tough to come by in San Francisco, so we had to check em' out.\n\nSpicy Beef Tripe - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mjLiWoKHx6M5eKQ2oNJ1wA&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nIt looked great but it really didn't taste like what tripe is suppose to taste like. More similar to Chinese style jellyfish. Thinly sliced, mildly spicy, and a tad gelatinous.. not what I was expecting.\n\nGreen Onion Pancake - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Mk9JSThJdHa5_GmZa_vf0g&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nYour typical Korean style pancake but made with green onions, except there wasn't much of it (see picture). There wasn't any dipping sauce that came with this dish for that matter, so we weren't sure if bland was what they were going for.\n\nCurry Duck Meat Over Rice - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qn2JDujeXAX1_XgN4gp72g&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nSauteed eggplant, cucumbers, and duck meat, which meticulously looked like Pai Gwut (Chinese Short Ribs), all cooked together in it's own juices (rather than a curry). Despite the watery curry, the ending result was pretty good. The duck meat was fall-off-the-bird tender which coexisted nicely with flavorful veggies with a small spicy kick at the end. \n\nShanghai Dumplings - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jeZcx2y2QhNsYP18HVXorQ&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nThe dumplings that made this hole-in-the-wall \"kingdom\" known across the land.. well, they were \"alright\". They were indeed made-to-order fresh and had the \"soupy\" first bite to em' but it just didn't impress me, or my friends, that much. They arrived no more than 10 minutes at our table, which was awesome, but a few of the dumplings just didn't have enough filling to them (rushing?). Perhaps I've just been eating too much Chinese food lately but my friends agreed that we've all had better before.\n\nService was substandard: the regular Chinese experience where they'll silently take your order, bring you your food when ready, and you'll only get attention if you flag one of them down or walk to them yourselves. The food wasn't bad but wasn't great either: I didn't get a chance to try their Xaio Long Baos or Potstickers because they were out but their orange curry-looking hot sauce was surprisingly good. Overall, just your average Chinatown joint moved Sunset kinda deal. The overwhelming smell of vinegar was just too much for me to come back for seconds.", "author": "Albert L."}

I absolutely love dumplings of all kinds, fillings, steamed, boiled, what have you. This place was perfect because it gave me just that ... dumplings of all sorts and especially XLBs. For those of you who don't know, an XLB (xiao long bao) is a sort of famous Shanghai-nese dish where a bun filled with meat is also filled with a cube of slightly frozen \"soup\" so when its steamed, the frozen \"soup\" becomes liquid and you end up with a little dumpling with soup in it. Delicious with a little ginger and some vinegar.\n\nTheir XLB... I'm not impressed.\n\nHowever! Their other dumplings (mainly steamed) were delightful. The skin was perfectly cooked and had the right kind of chewy texture without being hard or mushy. Their filling was just the right amount of seasoning, meat and veggies depending on which one you pick, and their other traditional Chinese dishes are fantastic. Being kind of a native and growing up in China for over 10 years, it really brought back childhood memories of my favorite dishes. This place is an A+.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

As I get older, my tolerance for waiting to eat at a restaurant is slowly waning.\n\nIn any case, the food isn't bad here. I tried the chicken & chive dumpling noodle soup, beef pancake, green onion pancake, cold wide mung bean noodle, and vegetarian dumplings. Overall, I thought that the food was cooked well, with the exception of one piece of my beef pancakes which seemed to be falling apart and inexplicably wet (the rest of the pieces were fine though). The pancakes had a good texture, the dumplings came out hot and the wrapper had a nice soft texture.\n\nMy main complaint with the food is that across the board, it was pretty under seasoned. I think a little more saltiness could've gone a long way in making it a better experience.\n\nGood thing they provide some sauce to liven things up a bit. The tableside house hot sauce is really good. It's pretty spicy with a numbing quality to it and has some kick, although it couldn't completely salvage the lack of seasoning.\n\nI'd be willing to give this place another try, but with other better options in the neighborhood it might be a while before I do.\n\nNOTE: This place is also pretty vegetarian friendly as it appears there are a lot of options and the waiter was very helpful in identifying which dishes were indeed vegetarian.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

My meal at Kingdom of Dumpling was one of the best I've had all year, and it's been an especially good year for eating on a personal level.\n\nThe dining room itself appears to be a poorly converted living room space, decked out with terrible lighting, a few drab pictures and signs written in completely indecipherable English. Similarly, the menu was translated by someone who I could only guess has a tenuous grasp of the English language. It's riddled with mistakes and it's an absolute wonder this place operates as a business, seeing as how you have to dodge waiters and cooks alike through the kitchen just to get to the bathroom (unisex, one toilet).  This isn't some million dollar fine dining establishment - it's the cozy mom and pop joint that those million dollar restaurants can never seem to top in the actual taste department. \n\nIn truth, you will be sweating when you walk in here, as a thick blanket of heat wafts right into the dining space, straight from the kitchen mere steps away. But none of the tiny, nagging little things about this place will matter once you have the food. All you need to do is order dumplings. It doesn't matter what kind because they are all monumentally good. The lamb, the beef, the soup dumplings. Order all of them.

Yeah, this place has a lock on dumplings. \n\nIt may have a ton of reviews on this website, and it commands a consistent wait time on most nights, but I still believe this is one of the better secrets for food lovers in SF.

Too bad our experience did not meet our expectations! It was terrible and I am probably generously giving it two stars. Not worth my $20 spent here!\n\nThe service is extremely slow. Our three dishes came out separately 25-30 minutes apart from each other. The servers are really slow and seem unaware of their customers, as well. When we walked in we were ignored even though one of the workers was watching us. During our meal they would randomly reach over us and one time dug through our chow fun when we weren't even done (and without asking) because we left the meat due to the fact that it tasted old and overcooked. I'm not sure if it is the language barrier but it made us feel extremely uncomfortable and totally unsanitary! \n\nThe food wasn't very good. The chow fun was alright and had flavor but again the meat tasted old. We also got the shanghai dumplings as suggested and they were just okay. I prefer Shanghai Dumpling King. The dumplings here were a bit too moist and soggy and overall not tasty enough. Lastly we got the sesame pancake rolls with beef shank. The rolls were warm but the meat inside was cold. The pancake was really bready and flakey like it was stale. I only took a couple bites because it took over 45 minutes to serve and at that point I was kind of grossed out from seeing dumplings coming in uncovered from outside the restaurant. \n\nIf you are coming here just beware that it is literally like eating at a hole in the wall. Not your typical yummy hole in the wall where the unsanitary flaws somehow make your food taste amazing.....", "author": "Britney L."}

We ordered these cold glass flat noodles marinated in a sesame chilli oil and topped with sliced cucumbers (this was my favorite). Then, we got 4 different dumplings --- shanghai soup dumplings, chicken & chive, shrimp & chive, and pork & corn. Then, we ordered a qq noodle (glass vermicelli) and pork dumpling soup.

We wanted to order the pancakes, but just couldn't eat another bite!\n\nA couple of things to note - this place is not the easiest to get to without a car.

Their cookies, croissants and brownies are amazing! Life's too short, have dessert first!\n\nAlso, make sure you use the restroom elsewhere before you come here, because like the Kingdom of Dumpling seating area, the kitchen is miniscule and you'd have to go through it to the teeny tiny bathroom.\n\nWe had the Soup Dumplings, which were great, the pork and green bean dumplings which had a nice gingery taste to them and soft outsides, and were our favorites for the evening, garlic green beans (these came out first and were perfectly cooked and seasoned, not to spicy but with a bit of a kick), onion cakes (super flavorful with not too much egg filling--a nice crisp yet chewy texture), and spring rolls, which I would skip next time I go. The spring rolls weren't bad, per se, but with so many other excellent dishes I could do without them (they were sort of mushy and mushroomy inside, and pretty flavorless). The total with two beers came to around $40, which isn't bad for the amount of food you get. It's nice they take credit cards, I wasn't sure they would since it's such a small restaurant.\n\n\nOur food came out sort of sporadically, kind of like at San Tung, which was okay. The place is so small that it's easy to flag down a waiter or waitress for extra items (yes, I wanted a fork, oh the shame).

I'm Taiwanese, and in Taiwan, dumpling skins are A LOT THINNER. And more monotonic, generally we just put minced pork and green onions in it; sometimes there's chives flavor which I hate. \n\nI usually dislike mainland Chinese-style dumplings. I don't like their thicker and chewier dumpling skin, it just feel....less refined. This place did change my perspective on thicker dumpling skins. They somehow make it work. Perhaps it's because while being thicker, the consistency is still good, and they fill it up with a lot of fillings so you don't feel like you're just eating the skin.\n\n\nWhat I get here:\n\nDumplings (of course) --- They have 10+ flavors. My favorite is the lamb dumpling which is rare to come by. I've only seen lamb dumplings when I was in Beijing and these are quite comparable.\n \nXiao Lung Bao (soup dumplings) --- These XLB are also slightly more thick-skinned. Compared to Ding Tai Fung's (Taiwan's most internationally famous XLB), their XLB I must say is equally good if you can accept thicker skin. \n\nSalt & pepper tofu --- Lightly-fried tofu cubes with little salt and pepper sprinkled. A rather light (and if you must, bland) dish. But I sometimes like the refreshing contrast against all the heavyweight dumplings.\n\nMarinated enoki mushrooms --- Rather unusual cold appetizer. The enoki mushrooms are marinated in a cold vinegar-ish sauce. I like it.\n\nBaked sweet cake \u87f9\u58f3\u9ec4\uff08\u751c\uff09 --- One of my favorite dessert dishes. It's a baked pastry shell with usually some kind of sugary filling (sometimes melted sugar, sometimes sesame). When it comes fresh out of their oven ...OOOOOH SO GOOD.\n\n\n\n\nAlso important note:  DIP THE DUMPLINGS and XLB in the sauce they give you! It's vinegar + soy sauce + ginger. It will make the already delicious dumpling 100% better!", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

There were many breakages, and the dumplings were not filled with as much soup as I expected. The meat was also not very flavorful and had an over-processed, slightly chalky texture.\n\nThe shen jian bao were pretty good, but they are erroneously called \"Shanghai pan-fried soup dumplings\" on the menu-- these are not pan-fried XLB; there is no soup in these dumplings! They are more accurately small meat-filled buns that are pan-fried and steamed concurrently.  The \"skin\" is actually leavened dough instead of unleavened dumpling skin. These took about 20 min to come out because they are made fresh to order.\n\nGarlic string beans were crisp, garlicky, and quite oily.

It tastes like milk. Trust me, just don't get it. I asked them to add more tea and got it back tasting the same. I have never experienced bad-tasting Thai tea and this place won that medal! I should have known better than to order Thai Iced Tea from a Chinese restaurant. \n\nAnyways, the garlic string beans were EXCELLENT.

Placed our name, number of people on a paper list, hanging by the doorway.

Item 5 onion pancakes (1) USD 3.95, cut into eight pieces stacked, was hot, oily, crispy, quite tasty, I liked it.\n\nUnder latest new dishes, item 3 the grilled skewered lamb (4) USD 6.95, a slow low mild spiciness that builds, was very tasty; item 18 garlic black fungus with cucumbers with vinegar and garlic USD 5.95, was a cold, slightly crunchy, quite tasty and different.  Q style jelly fish is one of their latest items not on their printed menu, but is posted on the wall.  Also under this catagory are:  green chives dumpling with egg, farmer's cucumber, boiled peanut with celery.\n\nUnder Wok dishes, item 4 garlic string beans USD 6.95 was excellent, cooked, but still crispy, flavored with soy sauce, oil, garlic.  Under drinks, item 2 Thai tea USD 1.75 was iced, sweentened with milk, tasty, not too sweet as I have tasted at other places.\n\nWe ordered one dish too many or didn't really need.  This was before adding the onion pancakes afterward, asked if this was enough food, our waitress said not, so we added under soup noodle, item 1 pork & shrimp wonton with wide rice noodle USD 5.95, which came after every other dish ordered was okay, I thought the wonton skin was rather thick, the soup base passable, but Yin Du Wonton Noodle on Pacific Ave at Beckett St would be superior with thin wonton skin, amazing soup base.\n\nRecommend calling to see if they have Shanghai pan fried soup dumplings before making the trek to the restaurant.

However, there's always a line out the door, so my curiosity got the better of me. They also seem to have cleaned up the place and have doubled their inspection score to 84 according to the link.\n\nI walked in at 5p on a Sunday, and there were still many empty tables. As we ordered and waited for our food, all the tables filled up and a crowd of people began to wait outside. It takes a while for the food to arrive since they steam everything, and, like its predecessor David's Kitchen, the place gets very hot while you're waiting. The male server seemed preoccupied with his iphone and barely looked around the dining room. \n\nI ordered the xiao long bao and the pork/corn dumplings with qq noodles. I didn't know what qq noodles were, but this was the only menu item that combined dumplings with noodles. Qq noodles ended up being the glass/cellophane noodles (reading the menu again after I ordered, I found out that I could've substituted the qq noodles with another noodle of my choice). The dumplings were much tastier than the xiao long bao; the xlb's soup was good but its skin was too thick for my liking. I heard a couple ask the server in Chinese if they could split a dumpling order (boiled, 12 dumplings per flavor) between two flavors of dumplings (so 6 each), and I think she said yes. I'm not sure if they normally allow that, but half orders would be good for smaller parties.", "author": "Diana B."}

The soup wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked. It comes with 6 dumplings for about $6. Try out Shanghai Dumpling King, their XLB are much tastier.\n\nPork and chive dumplings- I was worried the chive flavors would be overwhelming but luckily it was a subtle taste of chives and the pork was soft but once again, bland and nothing special. On the plus side, everything is made fresh and in house. The dumplings come in 12 pieces.\n\nPot stickers- Nice and crispy pot stickers, but the meat filling tasted exactly the same as the XLB.

He gave us menus as we were waiting then tried to take our order from outside of the door instead of letting us take a seat first. And when I suggested that we would like to step in and take a seat before ordering, he gave a very obvious expressions of discontent mixed with frustration. He followed us to our table, sat down and listened to our order--7 items for 3 people. After we were done ordering, he tried to get us to order extra things. First suggestion was chicken wings \"for the ladies\", then cucumber salad and when we said no to the cucumber salad he suggested it once again. He totally blew us off when one in our party asked for a glass of water.

Who knew that it would be found at a restaurant that manages to squeeze in ten tables and a kitchen in a room the size of a small garage.  Talk about a hole in the wall.\n\nCame here with one of my high school friends after hearing about this place for a while, and we both agreed ahead of time that we were going to have to put these dumplings to the test.  After perusing their somewhat extensive (relative to the size of the kitchen) but mostly dumpling comprised menu, we decided to go with:\n\n- Chicken and Corn Dumpling - a favorite among my friend's family, I thought it was pretty good.  The filing wasn't as moist as I would have liked, but I liked the combination of chicken and corn.  I would definitely get this one again.\n\n- Xiao Long Bao - my favorite and the star of the meal to me.  Just the right amount of delicious soup and meat on the inside, and perfect skin on the outside.  It was thick enough so that it wouldn't break apart when lifting it with chopsticks, yet still very soft and thin.  The only negative?  The tray came with just six of them!  \n\n- Cold noodles, cilantro, and dressing (I can't remember the name of the dish) - pretty good, and fortunately just a trace of cilantro flavor (yes, once again...I HATE cilantro).  Noodles were pretty al dente so they had some bite to it, and I liked the dressing.\n\nAs for service, it's a Chinese restaurant, so it's never going to be outstanding.  Even still, I thought it was pretty aggressive.  When my friend and I ordered, the waiter suggested we get a fourth dish, and went as far as to try to order the Chinese pancake for us.  Throw on the fact that the guy dropped the bill on our table when we were only halfway through our meal, and how the young waitress repeatedly ignored my friend whenever she tried to flag her down until it was time for us to leave, and it definitely put a damper on how good their food is.  In fact, it's the only thing that's held me back from five stars.\n\nGreat food and the best XLB I've had in SF, but expect to get rushed out so they can turn your table over.  Try to come early or a little late to avoid the main bulge of people coming here, especially on the weekend.  Despite the service, I'll be back...but maybe I'll shoot for take-out instead.", "author": "Mike L."}

As a recent summer transplant to SF, I've been searching the city for the elusive perfect soup dumpling (which I've been craving like crazy since they don't have them back in Chi-town) and YELP took me to this place.  Starving after hiking in Muir Woods, my BF and I arrived around 5 on a Sunday,  and there was already a wait - 4 people sitting in chairs so I figure it will be good.  We write our name on the clipboard,  I take a peek inside and start laughing - it's literally like you are in someone's living room.  I ask the waitress while waiting outside whether I can see a menu and she just waves her hand at me (huh?! I'm one of your own people!) but the menu is posted on their window.  We wander around for 30 minutes, contemplate going to a different dumpling place down the street, but finally get in.  \n\nI've often found the quality of the food at Chinese places is directly correlated with the engrish-ness of the menu: the more grammatically incorrect, the tastier.  At this point I was expecting a few Michelin stars.\n\nFrom best to worst:\n\nGreen Beans: Fried in really hot oil with delish garlic and soy sauce.  Not hard to make at home but they do a pretty good job with the sauce.  I keep telling myself its a vegetable, even though it tastes like crack (someone mentioned this)\n\nBoiled dumplings with shrimp and pork: Dipped them in the green bean sauce since the vinegar soy sauce with garlic they brought out was too vinegary.  Some bites you can def taste the shrimp, others you can't, but they were a big plateful (12) for $6.\n\nCold sliced beef: Not sure what this is called, but it was a decent appetizer. Drizzled with sesame oil and on a bed of wilted spring mix, it was too late before I realized that the lettuce probably wasn't meant to be eaten.\n\nSoup dumplings: UGH. So disappointed - this is what I came here for and they were so anti-climactic.  I'm used to juicy dumplings that burst when you bite the corner, but there was barely any of the succulent broth and the inside just tasted like mush.\n\nTotal bill for everything including tip, tax was about $25.\n\nMy quest for SF's perfect soup dumpling has resumed...", "author": "Mengo Z."}

You'll lure me in with sweet promises of soupy dumplingy goodness, only to scorch the inside of my mouth with your molten broth. Well, not this time! I'll set you aside for a moment and try the shrimp, pork and chive dumplings first.\n\nWell, the plan backfired. You know a mouthful of food is too hot when you try to douse the heat with hot tea. A day later, the roof of my mouth is still sore. And you know what? I have no regrets. Both types of dumpling were good, but the shrimp-and-pork were particularly worth a bit of mouth-scorching.\n\nThese are boiled dumplings rather than the steamed ones I'm more used to. The shrimp was not overcooked and rubbery, as it can be at cheap dim sum places. They went well with the vinegary dipping sauces, augmented with the strange orange stuff that was on the table instead of the more common chili oil.\n\nThe soup dumplings, as always, were fun to eat. If you aren't familiar with the procedure, I believe you're supposed to use your chopsticks to lift them into your spoon, suck out some broth, dip, and slurp the whole thing out of the spoon like an oyster from a half-shell. (Why not just serve the broth on the side, you ask? Stop asking so many questions. Eat your dumplings.) These were a little light on the broth, but still enjoyable.\n\nA note on getting a table: there's a little clipboard outside where you can put your name on the waiting list.

I don't expect great service from a Chinese restaurant, but this is ridiculous. \n\nAsked for refill on tea. Waiter takes it away and we don't see our teapot for 10 minutes. I inquire about it and they bring it back. Well, this happened twice. Same exact thing. I did not ask for the teapot to be taken away. I asked them for more tea. There was no miscommunication.\n\nSomeone on my table asks for water. 20 minutes later. Nothing. Gotta ask again. It takes 10 more minutes. So it takes 30 minutes to get water?\n\nWe are constantly running out of the vinegar. We ask for refill. Same poor service. It takes like 10-15 minutes before it comes out. Now that stinks because we need the vinegar for our food and we have nothing to dip the xiao long bao or dumplings in.\n\nThe wait staff is incompetent. They don't apologize either for being so delayed in everything.\n\nWe ordered the lamb dumpling. We never got it after 40 minutes so we ask what's going on. They said they sold out. Well, why didn't you tell us earlier so we don't expect it? Do we really need to be the ones who inquire?\n\nOne of our orders never came out so after 50 minutes we cancel it. We waited a long time for it and that just is no good. Another bun type dish came out but it was all burnt on the bottom and I mean black. The waiter said that's just how it is. I'm like \"What?\" He should have taken it back and apologized but instead he wanted us to eat it and pay for it. \n\nWe also had a red bean friend pancake. It took forever to come out. I would say 1 hour and that's after asking multiple times where it is.\n\nThe wait staff seemed like they wanted to just leave and get out of the restaurant so they can seat other customers. I tried ordering potstickers and another dish and was told it takes 40 minutes. I said that's fine. She proceeded to just cross that dish off and wouldn't place the order. That's wrong. So what it takes 40 minutes?! It's on the menu. There's nothing on the menu that says I can't order it.\n\nNear the end of the meal the owner shows up and tries to make amends because we told them about all these problems. I appreciate that. He's a nice guy, but his wait staff is horrible. I really don't like their attitude.\n\nThe total bill was $84, but we didn't know how they got there. There was no line item with price. We didn't know if we were charged for the items that were sent back to the kitchen or the items they ran out of. They let us calculate it ourselves. This really should be the job of the wait staff. \n\nA horrible, terrible, experience as it was someone's birthday. I am embarrassed to recommend this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-21", "description": "Kingdom of Dumpling was hyped up to me as legit good Chinese food.  It was good but not amazing.  I can be harsh with my dumpling reviews, but it's only because I love them.\n\nEverything at Kingdom of Dumpling is hand made and feels very homecooked.  This is what works for and against Kingdom of Dumpling at the same time.  The dough used for the wrap is thick, unlike the premade wraps you can buy at the market, an obvious sign of being hand made.  The soup and pork used for the fillings have the flavors you expect from restaurant quality food while still retaining that grandma made feel.\n\nDespite these excellent qualities the food just isn't up there with the best.  I'll compare the xiao long bao against Ding Tai Fung, the best and non-existant in the Bay Area.  The thick hand made wrap doesn't really work for the xiao long bao.  It's not as thick as the regular pork dumpling but it's too thick for my liking.  The soup base is good but not great, good pork flavor, soup is not greasy and struck me as having no MSG, it just didn't wow me.  The pork was solid but not amazing.  There isn't that much soup and the ratio of ingredients skew too much to the wrap.  3/5\n\nThe Sheng Jian Bao (pan fried dumplings) are bad.  Yes they are hand made and we were warned it would take 30 minutes to make.  It did indeed take 30 minutes to make and was not worth the wait at all.  The bread is too doughy, not enough of it is pan fried.  There is not enough soup.  The pork is ok but strikes me as having almost a minced texture which is bad.  The bottom is barely pan fried.  Shanghai style food is known for being greasy and some baos have a hint of sugar in their soup mix.  This is not that greasy and no hint of sugar.  I would eat this again but I wouldn't pay for it.  It doesn't taste bad but it's not a real Shanghai Sheng Jian Bao. 2/5\n\nThe Pork Dumping is the best dish I tried.  This is a typical dumpling that your mom or grandma would make.  The thick hand made wrap works perfectly for this dumpling since it is not fried.  The pork and soup mix taste home made and works for this dish.  Clean and distinct flavors here and a seeming lack of MSG make me give it two thumbs up.  This is not my favorite type of dumpling but it is 100% like the kind your grandma made or the kind you wish your grandma made.  The only down side is that the pork and soup are not up there with the very best of the best, but that's being too picky.   4/5\n\nSesame Pancake with Marinated Beef was a surprise.  I enjoyed this.  The sesame pankcake was crisp.  It seemed like a small sandwich.  Beef was ok.  I'd order it again but since it's not a dumpling I'll end it at that.\n\nThe waiter warned us that you may not order a second time so you'll need to make sure you get your entire order in the first time.  I assume this is because the place is very small and there is often a line here.  This is not a place to enjoy a casual meal.", "author": "Vincent V."}

It was very soupy, and I loved how it was actual soup and not just a ton of oil. But be careful, when eaten fresh the soup inside is still boiling hot, so don't burn yourself when you bite in.

I initially ordered chive pancake but the persistant waiter said, \"You order onion, since you Americanized.\" I looked at him puzzled and told him, \"But I like chive...\" and he replied back muttering what I thought was him saying he'd do a half and half order. When the pancake arrived at the table, it was onion, no chive.  I brushed it off cause it tasted good.  Not what I expected but it was good.\n\nI've eatten here once before a few years ago, and I remember the soup dumplings. Which was my favorite of the lot.  My sister and I finished the chow mein and seen the table next to us with chow fun.  The sister wanted more carbs so I put in an order for beef chow fun.  My niece decided she was hungry and ate the remainder of the pork and cabbage dumplings.  I then asked our waiter who was in passing if we can put in another order of the soup dumplings.  He made a rude comment and said, \"Give me a minute. You can not keep putting in orders.\"  AGAIN putting a puzzled look on my face.  I looked around and it wasn't even that busy.  At that point I was put off.  There was another waiter who was on staff as well.  When he passed us up, I asked for the check.  The chow fun took a while to come out. As soon as it came, we asked for a to go box and paid our bill. IDK if I'd come back.  I would give em a 1 star - \"Eek! Methinks not\" but the soup dumplings are delectable.

The dumplings were, quite simply, amazing. It was worth waiting 20 minutes in the rain for a table.\n\nFirst impression: KoD appears to be a converted Parkside home, with the dining area being smaller than the average livingroom. After hovering under the awning with two other couples seeking shelter from the rain, my eyes lit up as a table opened up and we were seated near the window.\n\nThe place was bustling with families and couples seated cozily near each other in close quarters. The two servers darted in and out of the kitchen in hurried fashion. After flagging one down, we ordered:\n\n- Xiao long bao (soup dumplings): It would be a crime not to order their famous XLB dumplings. After all, they were featured in SF's 7x7. Delicate and bursting with flavor, we poked a hole in each dumpling to let the steam out, then carefully spooned a bit of KoD's spicy orange sauce and soy sauce into each. Be careful - the soup is hot and bursts out when you bite into it. You might want to eat these from your spoon rather than from your chopsticks. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=yb1Ebv6jVkoilxESYH3qTA)\n\n- Pork with napa cabbage dumplings: To my surprise, I loved these even more than the XLBs. So much flavor! I even took two dozen frozen dumplings home with me. Just knowing I have them in my freezer right now makes me giddy with excitement - hee! \n\n- Shrimp dumplings: They were out of the pork & shrimp dumplings, so I settled for these. Good, but not as flavorful as the XLB and pork w/ napa cabbage dumplings. I think pork is the key differentiator here.\n\nService was a bit scattered, but it was very busy and they were as attentive as one could reasonably expect. I'm not sure how much the frozen pork and napa cabbage dumplings were, but based on my $35 bill, I think they're only like $4 or $5 a dozen. Could this get any better?\n\nIMO, a restaurant deserves five stars when I miss their food long after my visit is over. Those pork dumplings in my freezer don't stand a chance - they're being devoured today. And after that, I'll be in \"dumpling withdrawal\" until my next visit to KoD.", "author": "Mariela D."}

Hidden far away in Park Side, without the sign and the line of people waiting in the from, it could easily been mistaken for some sort of elevated basement. Despite being tightly packed into the square room, the patrons waited patiently to be served, as the late afternoon shined through the front windows.\n\nI was most excited to have found spicy beef tendon on the menu, even more when it appeared before my eyes. Beef tendons cooked in soy sauce, rock sugar and anise seed, chilled then thinly sliced. It is then mixed with chili oil, garlic, pepper, chopped cilantro and sesame oil.\n\nThe tendons see-through when picked up. It was cold and refreshing at first, the texture gelatinous but on the chewy side. Chopped up cilantro brought a nice aroma that erased any unwanted fattiness. Then - as we sat and ate, before we knew it, the stealthy numbing spice hit us. Like wild fire it spread through our mouth, making us sweat yet unable to stop going for more.\n\nAs for the dumplings, you could really taste the hand-knead dough. Thicker than the store-bought, machine-made ones, the dumpling skin was thicker and a chewier, the perfect kind that holds the stuffing together. Inside, ground pork and cabbage made a great pair - juicy, sweet, with a nice crunch from the green veggie. A light dip in black vinegar and some ginger slices gave a rounded taste.\n\nNext up, the tiao long bao. These dumplings were steamed instead of boiled. Enveloped within is a pork filling, prepared with solid pork aspics that melted into the tasty broth when heated. Because of the hot soup that could burst at the bite, it was recommended that we open up the dumplings a bit to let it cool before eating.\n\nUmami was its profile. The broth was on the greasier side, but tasty nonetheless. It provided a whole different experience next to the spicy tendon and the boiled dumplings - which were felt like a hugely satisfying, working man's meal.

So all those trying this place for the first time, please, do not set your standards too high. Because by the time you reach the bathroom in this place, you want to get out. I would rather have a port-a-pottie outside rather than the awkwardness of going to the bathroom here. They have a clean bathroom, but to get there you must go through the kitchen, dodge flying elbows from chefs, fit yourself in about 10 inches of space, avoid getting splashed by frying pan oils. Trust me, this is part of the whole experience of dining here. \nOr you can just not use the bathroom.\n\nThe menu is very straightforward. It's divided into 2 sections, the way I saw it. New stuff.... or .... Old stuff. But from the looks of the menu, the paper was written decades ago. So it's old stuff... or... old stuff. They have some Mandarin styled dishes, then they have a lot of fried stuff, then they have the dumplings. Chicken, beef, or shrimp with either corn, spinach, chinese spinach, chives, or a couple other choices. Everything is hand made, of course, and that's why it is amazing! One serving is enough to fill one person, provided they eat with rice. The Sesame donut looks good for desert, also, so try that too!\n\nSpace is tiny, decor is nonexistent, and ventilation is sufficating. I came around 5pm on a weekend, not busy at all, but with only 8 or 9 tables, I can see that it will get extremely busy real fast.  I was sweating like a pig by the time I finished eating, because it was sooo stuffy, I swear I thought I was eating in the middle of Beijing. Still, this is part of the experience. Although I am not coming back in the summer. I am getting it for take out. \n\nOne thing that I love is the hot sauce! I want to buy a whole jar of it, where can I get it? Dumplings made by experienced hands with lots of love will not go wrong. You must try this place, despite everything I said here!!! Service is also quick and efficient. They bus tables within 30seconds, get you  situated asap, but you just can't speed up dumpling makings.", "author": "Andrew I."}

So I ordered the regular dumpling from the waiter and he told me, \"you can not order anymore after this round.\" That was extremely rude and I didn't want to order anymore after his comment. After we finished our second round, I saw the waiter bring out the Shanghai dumplings to another table. This place is ridiculous. I'm never coming back here again.

I've just been twice in the last 2 days so I figured it was time to write a review for this place. \n\nFor two, we ordered the pork and napa cabbage dumplings, shanghai dumplings, green beans, cong you bing, and \n\nFor four, we had an additional 2 orders of dumplings, additional order of shanghai dumplings, additional green beans, bok choy, and wings and were very full. \n\nThe BEST thing (something i'd actually crave and would go out of my way to get) are the green (string?) beans, which are passed through oil and seasoned with soy sauce and garlic, and are very tender. The bok choy is also quite good. \n\nOf the dumplings, the Pork and Napa cabbage are my favorite, though the shrimp/pork/chive ones are good as well. I haven't tried the chicken but I've heard they aren't great. The xiao long bao are decent but I prefer Shanghai Dumpling King. \n\nThe wings were disappointing - they are 'fried' but not crispy since they were drowning in a rather sweet sauce :/ The cong you bing were also a bit of a letdown. Not quite crispy enough, and not much flavor either. They could have used more green onion as well as some salt. \n\nOverall I always leave this place very satisfied though, and would come back again and again for the green beans and the dumplings for a guaranteed satisfactory meal.", "author": "Kathleen L."}

That's a pretty big claim to live up to. Maybe my expectations were too high. (btw, I do not rate Chinese restaurants based on service...in my experience, the ruder the service and the dirtier the restaurant, the better the food -- this only applies for Chinese restaurants).\n\nMy friend and I got here at 12:20pm Sat, right before the rush. It's a very very small restaurant, with maybe seating for like 20-30 people. Very small. That's why there's always a wait (but I saw the owner giving little kids yummy Japanese fruit gummy candy while they waited...that was cute!). Don't forget to feed the parking meter like we did and end up with a hefty ticket!\n\nBecause of its popularity and crowds waiting, you gotta decide on everything you want in the beginning; you can't order more later. They try to get you in and out of there as fast as possible (i.e. they put the bill on the table while you're halfway done eating).\n\nI felt like we were pressured to order more (\"that's not enough for two people! I recommend getting _____ or _____\")...I wonder if it's because they want to reach a certain minimum order per table for it to be worth your sitting there instead of someone waiting outside who would be willing to spend more money. ;)\n\nAnyways, here's a review of what we got:\n1. Xiao Long Bao: this is what they're famous for. Very juicy and tender, not quite up to par with what I've had in Shanghai, but still good.\n\n2. \"Dumping\" soup with QQ noodle (lol Engrish): I did not expect QQ noodle to be the thin vermicelli glass noodle! QQ noodle to me meant thick chewy noodles. Definitely not it. The dumplings were good though...we chose pork & chives dumplings. Apparently you can buy these frozen dumplings at their other store at half the price. Hmm...sounds like a good idea!\n\n3. Green onion pancakes: They were okay, pretty thin, but they had absolutely NO SALT in them at all. You gotta put SOME salt in these things, typically. I usually don't like things salty, but this literally had no salt. I usually make better green onion pancakes than this (and the frozen store-bought ones are better). But I still ate more than my share of them. :P\n\n4. XO Beef Chow Fun: It was okay, but didn't have that fried taste that I love in good chow fun. Like when the wok goes on fire. Mmmm. But this was not it. The beef was really tender though!\n\nSo as you can see...I keep saying \"it was okay, BUT...\". I started out giving this place a 4 star (thinking it was a 3.5, rounding up), but after I wrote a few paragraphs, I felt like it really was only a 3 for me today. I think it may have just been my expectations were too high.\n\nPrices are reasonable though.", "author": "Esther Y."}

I may be biased as I've been spoiled by the great quality of dumpling restaurants of greater Los Angeles - and superior asian/Chinese restaurants in generals - but even compared to other dumpling restaurants or Chinese restaurants in sf that serve dumplings, this place is really average. Dumplings are pretty small - half the size of what dumplings typically should be). Seems like they pulled a Dunkin donuts and reduced their size by 50%. The dough was pretty gummy. New yawkers/northeasterners should know what I'm talking about). Shanghai soup dumpling were dry and have no soup in them and the skin was too thick. Beef noodle soup was bland, noodles are thin and skimpy in quantity, and there was barely any meat and the meat that was served was too fatty and sub quality. Beef pancakes were plain and oily. The prices, tho not pricey, is not exactly cheap either for the low quantity and quality that's served. The establishment is fairly small and decor is lackluster, you can say even run down and not very clean and could use a renovation. The service was typical service of non-smiling, non-talkative waiters that you'd see in the typical immigrant Chinese restaurant.

Kingdom of Dumpling is no exception to this. The restaurant is basically big enough to serve no more than 25 people, it's the smallest and divey-est kingdom out there. The menu is fairly basic in terms of Dim Sum, primarily serving dumplings and or dumpling-like things such as pot stickers until the wee hours of the night.\n\nThe vegetarian dumplings are filled with cabbage, glass noodles, ginger, garlic and maybe tofu, 12 mediumish pieces (for $6.25). The dumplings tasted very fresh and did not have any freezer burn taste, like many other SF Dim Sum choices. We also got the onion pancake ($5.00) which I enjoyed a lot, it was really good with the house hot sauce. The vegetarian potsticker filling was identical to the vegetarian dumpling filling, no major taste difference but I do however recommend the pan cooked over the steamed. \n\nI will be back here but I wish it was closer, Parkside feels like a different city to me.", "author": "Shannon Z."}

I had seen all of the reviews (over 950!) and thought that this was supposed to be the go to dumpling place on Taraval (versus Dumpling Kitchen), but I think I was wrong.\n\nWe ordered their XLB (only 6 to an order, for over $6!  That's over $1 per dumpling!!!) and I didn't think that they were that good. The wrappers were thin, and they had soup, but the filling was very blah texture wise, and the soup was not at all savory. We also got the stir fried green beans which were tasty, but small in portion. My wonton noodle soup with special \"QQ\" noodles was okay. I ilked the fact that they put stalks of perfectly cooked bok choy in there. But the noodles were anything but QQ, as they were obviously not homemade and they were very limp and overcooked. There were a large number wontons, but the wrappers were thick, and the filling didn't have enough napa cabbage to give it the right texture. I would consider getting this dish again, but forgo the more expensive noodles for their regular noodles. We also got the pan fried sheng jian bao which were not only flat but unacceptably greasy! And only 4 to an order, but honestly I wouldn't want to eat more. My sister also got the stewed beef in sesame pancake which she said weren't any better than what you can get at Marina Foods or a Ranch 99 hot deli. \n\nSo I was full after this meal, but definitely less than satisfied with the taste and quantity and quality of the food. Also, we were seated literally in a back corner right next to the kitchen and it was absolutely sweltering. I actually stepped outside multiple times to catch my breath and cool off because I was roasting in my sweat. \n\nLuckily I was able to save the experience slightly by ordering a dozen pork and chive boiled dumplings to go. These were $6.95 for 12 and actually quite delicious. I decided after trying one that they were too juicy to let dry out overnight and save for breakfast as was my original plan. So my sister and I promptly polished them off as second dinner. These were the only redeeming aspect of dining at Kingdom of Dumpling. I probably won't be back for dine-in, but I would consider coming back for boiled dumpling take-out if I'm in the area.", "author": "Leslie H."}

I went on yelp and saw this place.\n\nWhen everyone reviewed this place as small, please do not take that lightly. It is definitely a small small small space. If you are coming for dinner, please do intend to come early as there might be a wait for a table. I came for lunch, no wait, fast and breezy.\n\nService was decent, you wouldn't have the waitress coming every 15 minutes to check on you, but you wouldn't have to go looking for the waitress to get some service either. So we picked out the recommended dishes such as the xaio lung bao [6/order], shrimp and pork chive dumpling [boiled, comes in 12/order], chicken and napa cabbage dumpling [fan fried, comes in 10/order], garlic string beans, and beef pancake. Okay, I just realize that is actually a lot of food, but it was split among three people.\n\nXiao Long Bao: it was good, you can definitely taste that its handmade, fresh and lighter on the flavor. The skin is thin enough where about 1/3 of our dumplings' soup got drained when it got to our table. A little disappointing, but I manage to overlook it. $5 for 6 dumplings, a little heavy on the price\n\nShrimp and Pork Chive Dumpling: The skin is a bit doughier, but meant to be that way. With their housemade sauce, it was excellent.\n\nChicken and Napa Cabbage: Since it was fan fried, the texture was way better. You do get 10 instead of 12, but the crunchy texture makes up for it\n\nGarlic String Beans: Some call it a little bit salty, but some call it perfectly seasoned. It depends on personal preference. But some veggie on the table is good when you have balls of meat in every other dish\n\nBeef Pancake: it was okay, pan fried pancake stuff with a patty of beef. It's serves up to 4 people and it was okay. Nothing to rave about, but it's something new to try. It could be fried a little bit longer.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

We figured that a total of 10 dumplings per person would be decent, so we told him we were good with our original order. \nThen the food came, but we only got 2/3 plates. We started digging into the 2nd plate when the waiter threw the bill onto our table (which was rude and unnecessary). The bill only showed 2 plates of food, when we clearly ordered 3. \nWe asked the waiter why he didn't take our 3rd plate order, and he interrupted us and said \"I told you you'd want more food. There are people waiting outside to eat, so you can't order more. Sorry.\" He then proceeded to take our plates and went back to the kitchen.\n\nTL;DR\nReally bad service made the whole experience bad.

This Kingdom has more than just Dumplings!\n\nI found out about Kingdom of Dumping while watching the Chinese channel on my television. I don't understand any Chinese whatsoever, but the channel fascinates me. A commercial came on with pictures of the dumplings, and it made me so hungry! Although I didn't understand what they were saying, I was able to quickly write down the address and enter it into my phone to find out more about this tempting restaurant. \n\nWe over ordered and over ate -- they give you so much for what you order, and boy is it good! We got different dumplings --- shanghai soup dumplings, chicken & chive, and other various dumplings. We also ordered the noodle soup they have here. As you can see, a lot of food. On top of all this food, we ordered the pancakes, and they were so delicious!\n\nThere are some things to keep in mind when you come to Kingdom of Dumping, the restaurant is TINY. It is so small and steamy that the windows inside were completely fogged up. It was like a sauna in there. There are only a handful of tables so tables of 4 are rare. I recommend booking a table, my family was lucky to make it at an hour where we didn't have to wait for very long. I hear that the tables fill up very quickly and I believe it. \n\nI really recommend Kingdom of Dumping to anyone who wants to try an authentic Chinese dumping restaurant.", "author": "Emmanuella Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-06-18", "description": "This review is from about 5 weeks ago so it's past due.  The 1 star rating is due to the terrible service I received.  I placed an order online for pick up through my Eat24 App on my Iphone for the 2nd time in 5 days since the first time I had no issues: Ordering was quick & easy (love Eat24 btw), they got my order right, when I went to pick it up it was bagged and ready to go, and food tasted great.  The only minor thing I noticed was that certain dishes seem small in portion size (namely the noodles and green beans) however my tummy was happy, therefore I was content.  The 2nd time started much in the same way.  I placed an order through my Eat24 App and was on my way with my sister to pick it up at 5:45PM -the scheduled pick up time I selected on the app upon ordering.  When we got to the tiny dumpling house, I remember gushing to my sister about how great my last experience was - expected us to be in and out just like the other day.  \n\nWhen we got there I went up to the register right by the tiny kitchen to inquire about the pick up.  The lady responded that they had no order.  She seemed overly adamant to the point of insinuating in her tone that I probably never placed an order.  I was almost questioning whether I mistakenly ordered from somewhere else, but then I of course checked my handy iphone and low and behold I had my confirmation with Kingdom of Dumplings with my order items, as well as the confirmation of my credit card payment.  I then showed her my email confirmation, and she spoke to another lady who came over and said sorry we didn't get your order but we'll make it right now.  Annoyed that we had to wait but glad someone was acknowledging that I did in fact place an order I just handed the lady my phone so she could write down the order from my confirmation email.  20 min or so later, one of the ladies came over to the small table my sister and I were waiting at and plopped down a bag of food on the table.  I was taken aback as I expected a \"thanks for waiting, here you go\" or something to that effect.  She was about to walk away when I asked her, \"Is this everything?\" Since she hadn't said a word to us, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else we had to wait for.  She responded yes, without even looking at me.  \n\nAnyways, that should have been the end of it, however when I got home I discovered they had missed an order of the green beans!  Argggh as annoying as the whole situation had been, I had to call request a refund for the one dish.  I dialed the restaurant and a guy answered the phone.  After explaining that we didn't get our green beans he first insisted that we had received our full order, however after double checking he realized that was not the case.  Again, there was no apology for the situation but instead in a rude, defensive manner he said \"we can't do anything,\" and that if I want a refund I have to get it from Eat24 because they took my payment.  \n\nOMG, I wanted to pull my hair out!!!!   I completely understand that mistakes happen and I can accept that whoever was in charge of receiving orders never saw my Eat24 order for whatever reason, but for two out of the three people we dealt with (lady that plopped down the food and claimed I had the entire order), and the dude on the phone to never even acknowledge they made a mistake both showing an absolute LACK of care is where I have to draw the line!  Thank goodness there are SOOOOO many other delicious dumpling shops in SF!  For good reasonably priced food, I can live with mediocre/ average service, but being rude and dismissive when they were completely at fault is just not acceptable to me.  \n\nSpeaking of customer service of an excellent nature, it took me all of 30 seconds for Eat24 to listen to the problem, sincerely apology for the situation, and promptly promise to provide a refund in the normal processing time.", "author": "Caryn H."}

I always feel as if I am being invited into his home for his delicious hand made dumplings.  Warm and cozy.\n\nI usually order their lamb dumplings.  For the most part all their dumplings will come out looking similar but they have different fillings. I like the slight gamey flavor of lamb.  The flour that contains the meat is nicely chewy and denseness that gives a pleasant bite almost like a soft pillow with treasure inside waiting to be discovered.\n\nIf you are in search of some great Shanghai Dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao, this place won't disappoint. In chinese 'xiao long' refers to the little bamboo steam baskets you normally see at dim sum restaurants.  'Bao' means dumpling or bread.  You will see many people refer to them as XLB on the internet.  XLB is one of those things that really showcase a persons skill and love for the dumplings itself.  That love is then transferred to the guest in a form of euphoria when they take that bite.  XLB when done right is a little steamed dumpling with a nice thin chewy BAO that holds pork and something of soup inside. Lots of soup without the thin BAO breaking even as you pick it up with your chopsticks shows love and skill.  Thick BAO and no soup just means they didn't care or pay attention to the details.  You give me an XLB and I can tell you if the creator loves their BAO.  Over here, he loves his BAO and he loves to share it with all his guests.\n\nI've had better XLB in a couple of places in the US but in SF this rivals the short list (if any) of good spots.\n\nThey also offer many other authentic asian and shanghai dishes many of which are worth trying.  I personally stick with the dumplings.  Biting into those little pillows of love in a little hole in the wall is my kind of thing on any given day.\n\n4 stars only because their XLB stands behind a few really great ones I've had.", "author": "Colin M."}

The xiaolongbao are good, though they're not as good as at Din Tai Fung. We also ordered the pork and corn dumplings, which were yummy. The green onion pancake was really delicious and the texture was perfect. The pan-fried xiaolongbao were also juicy and flavorful. The lamb skewers were okay, not bad. We also ordered the string beans which were pretty good.\n\nI'd definitely come back here again.

When they came out, the owner/chef/waiter asked us if we knew how to eat 'em and we said \"nope\".  He was nice and patient enough to explain to us the technique - 1) pick up a dumpling with your chopsticks; 2) bite a little piece of the side towards the bottom; and 3) suck out the soup but be careful because it might be hot.  It was a great experience!  You truly have to enjoy every sip and every bite, especially since they were handmade w/ love :)\n\nWe also had the green onion pancake and the shrimp & chive dumplings which were both really good.

For me, soupy things and dumplings just spell out the most perfect things to have to warm you right up.  \n\nCame here for an early dinner--before 6pm-ish.  And luckily, we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  Kingdom of Dumpling is a hole-in-the-wall place in all aspects; from the non-obviousness exterior, to literally feeling like you are dining in someone's low-ceiling garage.  The whole environment spells out seedy! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=4MhJsu-9LF7YTMtvrjF6Pg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=26xD66-_AIE2JMZP-3W1HQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=1i76RAseg6wQttzQOfdhjg\n\nLuckily, being from San Francisco, you really know not to judge a spot by it's cover.  And despite the stuffy-ness from the low ceiling of the dining room, it was actually quite cozy and warm given the nippy weather outside. \n\nMind you, if you don't speak Mandarin, you might have a difficult time figuring out what certain items are because of the fact that the descriptions on the menu all are pretty similar.  \n\nFurthermore, the server's speak minimal English.  The owner, if you are lucky to have him on site, is friendly and cheerful and speaks great English.   But overall, you must definitely just go with your gut here when ordering.  \n\nSo one of the items with all of the talk is of course the Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Siew Loong Bao).  6 Dumplings for $4.95  Perfectly steamed, with a nice chewy texture; great amounts of broth inside as you bite into the dumpling.  I love the feeling of burning my mouth as I pop these little things in! Lol...it's a little fetish of mine.  =X\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=EVHwrCGmhXQAM2B6lHW09A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=qdziasSuLL_E8yd5-HjL7g\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=WKNAPBJdmAtAriwGJ2aZBg\n\nAlso ordered the Pork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage.  12 Pieces for $5.95.   Also quite yummy and nicely stuffed with pork.  I like when my dumplings are boiled and steamed perfectly without a sticky texture that I so often experience at other spots. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=xS7L42XUAt9fH0EI85k1Vw\n\nAnother hyped-up item here is the Onion Pancake.  *Eh* For me, this item did not live up to the excitement that I was looking forward to.  Pancakes were paper thin and soggy. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=Bhd0uEqd6FnjHop0U_Hm_w\n\nIn need of something soupy, we also ordered the Beef Stew Soup Noodle with \"QQ\" noodles.  QQ noodles are just thin clear noodles.  Dish came with Mustard Greens, Mushrooms.  There would've been more pieces of beef, but the broth was flavorful. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=bUXnZzwK-NCKGstNz8EV6Q\n\nLastly, we ordered the Shanghai Style Donut.  We ordered this blindly as the server really didn't have a good description for us other than that there is sesame top.  What it actually is close to the Sesame Balls with Red Bean Paste Inside (Jin Dui, when you eat this at dim sum).  But rather, it was filled with a black bean paste and the texture of the donut is more like a flakey puff pastry.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=D4ZSlHwECO_8lo7olrkVVg\n\nMy advice on this spot...come here if you aren't super starving as you definitely need to order a lot of dumplings to actually get full.  Our bill came out to about 30 bucks, which for dumplings is a bit steep in my eyes.  Definitely more of a snack spot.

Seeing the reviews on yelp, I guess it's a do-able place. My dad who passes by often says there's usually a long long long line outside. But the four of us went anyways and got to the restaurant around 6:30. We were seated within 5min. I guess it wasn't busy yet. I looked around and the restaurant looks like it is in dire need of a health inspection and remodeling but besides that, there wasn't a free table big enough to fit the four of us. So the server put two tables by the window together and we sat length-wise facing the window looking towards the street. Not the best seating arrangement but it's manageable for such a small restaurant, we were willing to let that go. About 10 mins later, the line started to build outside. Man, we were lucky. \n\nAfter much debate on what to order, we ended up with:\n- lamb dumpling with napa (12 pieces) \n- chicken dumpling with napa (12)\n- onion pancake (8)\n- shanghai soup bun (6)\n- beef chow fun (roughly 8x14 inch plate)\n\ni'll be honest, i have had better dumplings when i was touring in beijing but for something outside of china, they're pretty legit. I preferred the lamb over the chicken. It's a different and not a generic flavor compared to the chicken. The onion pancake I wish was a bit crunchier but that's just a personal preference. The shanghai soup bun is ok. If the bun part was a bit softer, maybe it would be more like the ones my cousin's shanghainese grandma makes. Chow fun is pretty generic. Very similar to most chinese restaurants around the city. To me, it tasted better when it was lightly mixed with the dumpling dipping sauce. \n\nOverall our bill for 4 people came down to $31, pretty affordable compared to other restaurants we've been to. I did leave feeling a bit hungry but that's because we only ordered 5 dishes. Three stars because they have room for improvement.", "author": "Vickie C."}

My personal favorites are the pork with string bean and the shrimp with chives. Remarkably priced at about 50 cent each, they contain a good amount of filling with a nice, thin skin. The sesame pancake with marinated beef is another bright spot on a menu with several interesting non-dumpling offshoots.\n\nMaybe my obsession with hole-in-the-wall places stems from my humble beginnings and paranoia that my 401k is going to fail me in my time of need.

It is a TINY place!  There's probably 7-8 tables at most, each sitting about 2-4 people each.  We were seated at probably the worst table - the one right outside of the kitchen.  From one side, the kitchen blows hot air at you; from the other side, you get a cool breeze from the door outside.  The people behind us finished their food and left, so we promptly asked if we could switch.  Thankfully they let us switch!\n\nWe got lamb dumplings and a pork/chive (I think it was chives, anyways) dumpling.  I'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gamy taste, but I was a fan of the lamb dumplings!  The pork and chives dumpling was also good, but not as good as the lamb dumplings.  You could really tell that the dumplings were freshly made.  They were also really generous with the filling!  You get 10 or 12 (I forget) dumplings for about $5-$7, so it was pretty cheap!\n\nA tip - don't ever order the beef chow fun.  The noodles and bean sprouts were fine, but the beef tasted like cardboard - literally!  The beef tasted like a dry piece of cardboard that fell into the dish.  You could tell it was beef, but it was either really, really old or really, really overcooked.  So gross!\n\nOverall, the dumplings were good.

Saw that some Yelpers compared XLB's made in NYC to those made in San Francisco. :)\n\nIMHO, the XLB's, \"Pork Dumplings with Corn\", \"Pan Fried Soup Dumplings\" were completely bland...no salt, no soy sauce, nada, zippo, the total ewwwwwwwwwwww.\n\nThe \"Pan Fried Soup Dumplings\" had absolutely no soup in them. The meatball was this pink-beige mass of moistened meat fibers.\n\nI also ordered the pancake with the marinated beef. Unfortunately, the beef did not taste marinated. The pancake seemed to be stuffed with slices of beef with a little smear of hoisin sauce. Pretty uneventful.\n\nMy husband order the garlic string beans. Those beans were delicious.\n\nHe also ordered the fried tofu squares. Ummm...when you were lucky enough to just a hint of salt, the fried tofu squares were crunchy and tasty. Without the salt...well...chalk it up as bland food that was, at least, pleasantly crunchy.\n\nA touch of ginger, a hint of sesame oil, and/or a whisper of salt would have been some welcome touches to the food. It's pretty sad when the 2nd best-flavored item of a dinner consisting of 6 items was the soy-sauce/ginger condiment for the XLB's. :(\n\nThe food was disappointing, especially after having some great dim sum at some San Francisco restaurants like the \"Beijing Restaurant\" and \"Hong Kong Lounge\".\n\nOn the plus side, the service was polite. The unusual method of obtaining a seat in the restaurant gave us a chance to meet some new folks.\n\nPerhaps the normal dumpling makers are on vacation...I don't know...but for now, NYC seems to have the better XLB's. :)", "author": "Tina V.

B/c of this & 3 different cars driven, DL & Wanugee arrived very early but were able to nab 1 little table for 2--out of, maybe, 16 customers (kids included!) in one of the tiniest, most scrunched-up yet most highly regarded HITW spaces I've ever been.  Additionally this awkward, cramped setup caused a few other parties to switch tables--with plates still full of dumpling tasties--in order to accommodate the 6 Yelpers by annexing 2 tables, right next to the front door, perfect for cooling off from both the tight space--FOCUS!--and spiciness.\n\nThat said we ordered Spicy Chinese Green Beans, Beef Stew Noodle Soup, & the no-duh handmade dumplings: Pork & Spinach, Pork & Shrimp, Pork & Corn, and their signature--Pork Shanghai Dumplings or XLB--costing an average of $6.50 for 12 of those bite-sized pieces...\n\nWait. Wha?!\n\nI had Xiao Long Bao?!?! Those juicy, soup dumplings that virtually all of my Asian Yelp buddies kept yapping & yapping throughout my Yelp life?!?!?\n\nReally, Yelp friends, I was 1,000,000% clueless as Cher Horowitz that we were eating XLB the WHOLE time, until I saw Yelp highlights & Wanugee's review, 2 days after our dinner *_*.\n\nANYWAY, the XLB were unforgettably delicious & juicy for Fia's firstie.  This oblivious 5-Footer solely used her grass green chopsticks to grab hold of one XLB, dip it in that divine soy ginger sauce, & impulsively bite that piece, gushing out (by surprise) the more-than lukewarm soup inside it, rather than grab it, safely place it in the soup spoon, let the soup gush in my mouth, THEN dip it in that brown sauce.  Nonetheless, it's worth others' firsties, & my healthy hunger's intermittently begging me to eat more XLB back in the So Cal.\n\nYes, all the other mentioned, veggie-filled entrees were stand-outs as well--maybe except for the garlicky Green Beans (which was my responsibility ^_^) where I honestly had better.  Included w/ our dinner was this salmon orange-colored spicy sauce that looks & has a less viscous texture as the spicy mayo found in many sushi places.  Bottom line: the Kingdom of Dumpling crew played nobody's fool, based on their cute video in their Yelp page.  Despite a space too miniscule even for me, & despite a hurried yet graceful waitress apologetically spilling one of our dumpling orders in the middle of our table, K of D is 1000% returnable, particularly b/c I'll be self-stuffing more sweet indulgences in my short @ss figure x/ & I'll be prepped on a more finesse way to eat XLB.

One of the reasons why there are crowds outside is the size of the restaurant.  The whole place probably houses around ten to twelve at most, 2 seated tables.  \n\nForewarning for those future patrons: It can get stuffy inside; you may feel like one of those steamed dumplings they serve.  At first glance, you'll also wonder where the bathrooms are to freshen up.  Hark not to fear, there's one in the back.  The only thing is that you'll have to walk through the kitchen past the gauntlet of servers and cooks.  It's an interesting sight, and yes, like I said before.  This is place is small.  \n  \nI usually get the XBL (xiao long bao...get hip to the lingo dumpling student), pork and/or chicken dumplings with green chives.

On several occasions, I saw them have some workers double parked bringing in fresh dumplings because the restaurant ran out.  \n\nWhen you bite into a freshly cooked dumpling, have the dumpling broth squirt on your shirt even if the soup is burning your skin when it goes through your shirt.

Poorly painted white walls with crooked award pictures and other assorted paintings, I found myself more interested in traffic passing by. \n\nNext, I had absolutely the worst seat in the house. The table was broken and rocked and was next to the opening to the kitchen. The kitchen and the dining area was only separated by a curtain, no door.  Every time someone walked through, the curtain moved and I was blasted by the heat coming from the wok. I'm talking like you just opened a 350 degree oven with the fan on hot. Since I was near the kitchen, the waitress would stand there to check on the other tables, but consequently it felt like I was being hovered over on during my meal. Last of all the food safety card reading 86 was literally  right next to me, making me wonder what those 14 points were knocked off for, god only knows how sanitary their kitchen is. Here's an idea, lose the table and put a statue or a fountain there, you'd loose 2 seats, but it would liven the place up at least.\n\nNow about the food. If you do decide to go and try this place out, I would not get anything else but dumplings. They were pretty good and it was the only thing I have nothing negative to say about. Chicken wings were mediocre, vinegar being the only flavor I could taste. Lastly the 3 layer beef pancake was pretty much a hamburger patty wrapped in dumpling dough and seared.

As if the freshly steamed parcels of deliciousness weren't enough, KoD offers up an ominous looking orange chili sauce (habanero?) as well as fresh ginger, vinegar, and soy sauce, the combination of which sends your palette on a torturous trip of euphoria.\n\nOf course, if for some INSANE reason you find yourself looking for something other than dumplings (shame on you) KoD also offers up some typical Chinese fare (think tendons and noodles). \n\nA typical meal for two (3 orders of dumplings + 1 entree) usually only sets me back $20-something bucks...it's a steal I tell you!", "author": "Kevin T."}

The guy on the phone barked at me that the order would be ready in 25 minutes after I finished uttering the 4th dish when I had intended to order a 5th.  I managed to get it in before he hung up on me.  \n\nI got there in 25 mins and waited an extra 5 in my car just for good measure, seeing as how it appeared busy and there's absolutely no space to wait inside the restaurant.  I go in and they quickly ushered me to the cashier, took my money and told me to wait outside.  After 20 minutes, a guy came out to check on the waiting list, so I asked him to please check on my order.  He barely acknowledged me and muttered something and rushes back inside.  He came out and seated some people and went back inside.  I waited some more and finally a girl comes out with my order.  From the time I called to the time the order was ready, it was basically about an hour and people that had arrived after me were getting seated and ordering food, while I was suffering the cold outside.  So much for quick and easy takeout.  This was the antithesis of that cause I could've just gone there and been seated and eating already.  So basically they wait until you get there to pay and then start making the food.\n\nAbout the food, the soup dumplings, for which they're famous for, were less than stellar.  The wrapper was too thick and chewy and lacked soup.  The pork and napa dumplings were actually pretty good, as was the garlic green beans.  Chicken wings, which were not great, come 6 per order which would be expected in an appetizer, not an entree.  Pricing wise, everything appeared inexpensive ($5 - $7), but the portion size was the smallest out of every other Asian restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  You really need to double up the orders if you're really hungry.  \n\nOne thing to note, if you still plan on going there and eating in, don't bother to go if you're a party of more than 2.  There are literally only about 6-7 tables for 2 in the entire restaurant.  The place is so freaking small that they keep their trash bins and boxes of beers in the entranceway to the upstairs unit right next to the restaurant entrance, which is where I was waiting because it was the only spot where some warm air from the restaurant was blowing out to keep me from freezing.", "author": "Kat E."}

The waiters were also pretty quick and straight to the point, which to be honest, I couldn't blame them since there were tons of people waiting outside and they've been stuck in that steamy room for a while. We ordered Pork with Napa cabbage and pork with green chives dumplings as well as xiao long bao. \n\nI have to thank my boyfriend for the one who suggested the pork with green chives dumplings because eating those felt like heaven in my mouth. The dumplings were piping hot and upon picking them up, you could tell there was a lot of juices beneath the thick chewy but pleasant skin. The pork with napa wasn't too bad but the green chives really took the show with this one. I sat through the whole session in utter bliss as I dipped each dumpling in the vinegar and hot sauce and placed it in my spoon to make sure I could get a hold of any of the juices that came out. \n\nThe xiao long bao wasn't bad. The skin was made just right so that the soup wouldn't drip out but to be honest, I think I like Shanghai Dumpling King's XLB more so based on the flavoring. \n\nThe bill came out to be about $20 bucks (we also ordered a thai iced tea..which came in a paper coca cola cup) which wasn't too bad, considering how amazing the dumplings were.\n \nI am still in dumpling bliss after eating at your place almost two hours ago. ahhhhhhhhhhhh...yeah.

I will not shy away from addressing it.  Although Kingdom of Dumpling manages to steal several small victories, Dumpling Kitchen indisputably wins the throwdown.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling's eating space is woefully limited.  Do not consider arriving with a party of more than six.  We were initially stuffed into a corner, with intermittent blasts of desert heat emanating from the kitchen.  Thankfully, upon the kind owner's arrival, we were moved to a table to free us from suffering numbed limbs.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling's namesake is respectable when judged alone, but falls short in comparison to Dumpling Kitchen.  The dumplings come piled on a small plate, causing punctured skin and severe losses of dumpling soup in the buried casualties.  The ones that remain intact are tasty, with appreciably flavored fillings.  My favorite was the pork and chives.\n\nThe green onion pancakes and potstickers were decent, but we were all dismayed at the miserly portions.\n\nWhere Kingdom shines is in its noodle dishes.  The beef stew noodles presented perfectly cooked strands of noodles that were delightfully elastic.  The rarely-seen beef chow fun with XO sauce was also full of great flavors.\n\nIf Kingdom of Dumpling were not in close proximity to Dumpling Kitchen, I would not have judged it as harshly.

The soy sauce they served alongside dishes was meh, but I was all about their in house hot sauce to give these meh dumplings a better kick.  The raved about chive pancakes were not what we expected at all.   My brother is a culinary buff himself and is a curious mother 'effer, and when we asked what sauce was in their seaweed app, the server didn't know and didn't even make a move to care and ask.\n\nThe reason for the 2 stars is that service was suuuuper whatever, and all of us rooting from service jobs and restaurants know better.  We know when to let ok to bad service slide since we don't know what's going on behind the counter or kitchen.  Being such a small restaurant, you can't get that hectic enough to give below so-so service, and us being positioned directly to see the kitchen....let's just say if you're all about eating at places that follow health codes to the T  - this isn't your cup of tea.  Or, just don't sit facing the very revealing kitchen.  \n\nSo-so food, less than so-so service, an uncared for ambiance.", "author": "Nadia D."}

I circled around the neighboring houses and still couldn't find parking.  Luckily I saw an open spot on the street and I dashed towards that meter parking spot.  I must say, my parallel parking skills is really improving (took me less than a minute).  Another plus, it was Sunday so parking was free. \n\nType of food:  Chinese\n\nAmbiance:\nThis is definitely a hole in the wall restaurant and from the outside, I would probably never think about going in.  It has very minimal seating, but people stilled lined up outside on a Sunday evening. The crowd was a nice mixture of young adults and families.\nThe decor is definitely not appealing.  Plain white walls with crooked frames and awards everywhere.  But what else do you expect from a random hole in the wall Chinese restaurant?\n\nService:\nThe boss is definitely an interesting fellow welcoming customers and calling everyone \"mei mei\" and \"shwai gu\" (spelling?). The food came out promptly and fresh.  It only took them less than 2 minutes to notice that our teapot was empty too.\n\nTaste:\nWe had fungus salad, green onion pancakes, 2 baskets of xiao long bao, and pork/cabbage dumplings. \nThe portions are a great size and we were definitely tummy satisfied by the end of the meal.  We all enjoyed the orange hot sauce! I'm not sure what it is made out of, but its tasty and spicy.  My favorite was definitely the xiao long bao.  The skin was not too thick and the meat had lots of flavor.  You must be careful to pick it up with your chopsticks or else the soup (best part) inside will spill.\n\nPrice:\nThe total price was roughly $35.  Quite a deal for all the food we ate and how satisfied we were. Thank you Annie for dinner.\n\nOverall: \nMy dear big bro has constantly been raving about this dumpling house.  I'm so happy that he came to San Francisco (to visit his lovely girlfriend) and make time to hangout with me.

The dumplings themselves are thicker and really fill you up (in hindsight we should have ordered more of the soup version and less of the regulars).  The sweet corn in the chicken dumpling gave it an unexpected flavor but it wasn't bad.  The pork was more traditional.\n\nAlso had the XO beef chow fun.  At first glance, it seems disappointing as it's 95% noodles with very little beef and some green onions, bean sprouts and onions in between.  But the texture of the chow fun noodles was excellent - tender but not overly chewy.

There are two tables just inches away from the door and my bf and I were some of the unlucky ones to be seated at one of these. The door is very light and kept swinging open and slamming shut, upon which a huge gust of wind blew into the restaurant.

It wasn't the fault of the customers but I think KoD really needs to reconsider the layout of the tables. \n\nWhile the xiao long bao and the corn and pork/chicken dumpling are pretty amazing, everything else is pretty average.

WHERE THE FUCK IS THE PEN??? We looked EVERYWHERE for it. Normally places would tie a little string to the pen so it wouldn't get lost! A nice man sitting next to the door was nice enough to lend us his pen. Here's the third and final surprise. We got seated RIGHT after. What was the point of us signing in then???? The waitress didn't even cross our name off the list either! Wouldn't that lead to further confusion later on?? Oh well, whatevahz.\n\nAnyways, the food was pretty decent.

So, when I saw how many great reviews there were for Kingdom of Dumplings I was thrilled. It would be my first experience of xiao long bao in SF. Perfect!\n\nSadly...I was disappointed. If you've been to Din Tai Fung, the famous Taiwan xiao long bao chain, then you pretty much compare every other xiao long bao to it. It's simply perfect there. And so that's what I did. The wonton was way thicker than most xiao long baos I've ever tried. The first one I had was pretty soupy. It's what makes xiao long bao so good. It's a soup dumpling. It's what I expect. After my first one though, I barely got any soup in any of them. BoOoo! The pork inside was very basic and lacked flavor. The ginger that you eat with it was sliced way too thick. Everything just seemed to be working against it. \n\nIf there's one positive thing about this place is that their regular dumplings are pretty good. The decor of this place...well..you have to overlook it. I felt like the place hadn't been cleaned in years. \n\nI wish and hope that there's a better place for xiao long bao in SF, otherwise, all of the Bay area is missing out on something delicious!", "author": "Bernice L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-02", "description": "We were looking forward to dumplings all day. Shanghai Dumpling King closes on Tuesdays and the Dumpling Kitchen was on vacation until 7/3. This should have been a sign to NOT eat dumplings and to wait. We were already on Taraval and this tiny restaurant was a block up from the Dumpling Kitchen.\nI came around 6pm and got a table for three. It wasn't that busy with small two-seater tables that were still vacant. I got seated right away and that was the only good thing that happened. My friends came and we were going to start with a large order of the soup dumplings and then place the rest of our orders after. First off, you can only order once. That's right, only ONE time. Get it right, cause you won't have another chance and they won't come back...not even to refill your teapot. \n\nOur order consisted of:\n1) 4 orders of Shanghai Soup Dumplings\n2) Crispy Chicken Wings\n3) XO Chow Fun\n4) Green Onion Pancakes\n\nAfter he took our order, he tried to upsell us on their garlic string bean and a bunch of other dishes. As we waited for our food, a bunch of people came to pick up their take out orders. They were simply ushered straight to the cashier and lingered awkwardly in the middle of the room. The restaurant probably seats about ~21 people comfortably with a view of the kitchen, cashier, sinks, etc...\n\nOur food came and I could not be more disappointed. The dumplings are a major disappointment. All of them were broken with the soup dripping to the bottom of the steam basket that was layered with one cabbage leaf. The dumplings weren't hot and they can be placed in your mouth without burning your tongue. They were not the steaming hot plump dumplings that I'm fond of. The green onion pancakes were okay, but were glazed with grease. I'm pretty sure they didn't make those fresh in house and tasted like the frozen kind from Sunset Super. Before the rest of the food came, the bill came out. We should have told them to cancel the rest of the order if they were going to charge us for what we didn't get. Lastly, the crispy chicken wings were not crispy, just barely cooked in a wok with some brown sauce. The skin was chewy and they weren't glazed with any flavor. They were just brown. The chow fun didn't taste like anything. The noodles were all broken apart with some bean sprouts and beef. We took it home to dress it up ourselves because the \"XO\" sauce they claimed was nonexistent. \n\nOur teapot was empty and with all the MSG on our table we asked for some water on three separate occasions. Each of us took a turn, in the span of 15 minutes, and was simply waved off, ignored, acknowledged and then ignored again, and then we just gave up. The restaurant wasn't busy and many of their tables were still empty. The check was already there so we didn't have to ask for that. We asked for a couple of boxes to take the rest of the dumplings and chow fun to take home and those came fast. Our bill came out to be $40 and thankfully we had cash. This is a no-tip situation and is highway robbery. We will not be coming back.", "author": "Vivian L."}

Actually, \"rival\" is a little too optimistic; I would've been happy just to find XLB that are somewhat close to par. (I'd be sorely disappointed at Shanghai Dumpling King and Old Shanghai before.) Perhaps my expectations were too high, but once I've had good food it's impossible for me to lower them again.\n\nAfter my dinner at Kingdom of Dumplings I think it's best to give up those hopes. The XIAO LONG BAO weren't quite soupy enough and the minuscule lump of bland minced pork inside was laughable. Worst of all, the skin was way too thick. These were not the delicate soup dumplings I've had from the experts. (For XLB in the city, I would stick to King of Noodles.)\n\nI wasn't very impressed with the other items I had there either. The GREEN ONION PANCAKE wasn't crispy and browned enough on the outside and desperately needed salt. The LAMB DUMPLINGS weren't as lamb-y as I could've expected and, again, the skin was overly thick. They just felt... monotonous; perhaps some type of dipping sauce would've helped. Also disappointing were the SHANGHAI PAN-FRIED BUNS. The pork filling-to-bun ratio was way off. I mean, I like my carbs but they need to be flavoured with something... like pork (not that the pork filling was all that great either). They also didn't do a very thorough job of pan-frying them. Pan-fried buns should have brown crispy bottoms (teeheehee), just sayin'.\n\nThe only dish my friend and I really liked was the GRILLED CUMIN LAMB SKEWERS. Wow, these were amazing!

Because the dumplings are DELICIOUS but the restaurant could be cleaner, have better service and...  sometimes, something makes your tummy sick later.  We wonder if the unsettle/grumbly/greasy stomach you feel later is because of the greasy nature of the dumplings or the suspicious black stuff under the lids of the taaaasty hot sauce.  Really... how is that hot sauce so good?  Wish they'd clean up things a bit.\n\nService... not so hot.  On our first trip, we waited outside for about 20 minutes to get a table and then a good while to order (which was fine) but we got a little irritated when a Chinese family came in waaay after and got immediate service, ordered and their food after  us but then got food before we did, though our order had been placed waaay before theirs.  They literally got the same dumplings and soup we ordered.  Not cool. We had to sit there watching them eat OUR food because they were at the next table.  \n\nBecause the dumplings are like crack, we decided to give them a 2nd chance in case that 1st trip was a unique negative experience.  On our 2nd visit, the food was delicious again, service was a lil better but still, they only had 1 waitress and 1 cook... on a busy Sat afternoon. Also, we both had tummy aches a lil while after eating again.\n\nAll in all... and sadly... \n\nMight see ya there.  *sigh* lol", "author": "Susan D."}

However, when eating these XLBs, be careful, they're extremely hot! I burnt my tongue eating one of these! As for the pan fried XLBs, they were decent; the skin was too thick and was overly fried.

The QQ noodles are okay, I liked the soup and the clear noodle, but nothing too special about them. We got fish dumplings with the QQ noodles, those were good and they stuffed it with plenty of chives.

If you're a teeny mom and pop Chinese restaurant, I can understand. But if you're a teeny mom and pop restaurant that boasts \"#8th out of 100 Chinese restaurants in San Francisco\" fliers INSIDE and OUTSIDE your restaurant, I'd think you'd be able to maybe buy one more frying pan???\n\nHow did I know they only have one frying pan? My friends and I decided to come out to SF for the day and lunch at Kingdom of Dumpling per another friend's recommendation. We arrived at this teeny hole-in-the-wall around 12 and didn't have to wait long for a table for four. The prices are quite low and really affordable for the amount of dumplings that we got. HOWEVER, they're pretty stingy on fried dumplings (since they only have ONE FRYING PAN). If you get regular dumplings, there are about 13 per order. If you want fried dumplings (which is how I usually like them), there's only 10. We ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, pork and chives, pork and spinach, and a chive pancake. There was an interesting item on the menu that I really wanted to try (FRIED Shanghai soup dumplings), but when ordering, since we wanted both orders of the pork dumplings fried and the chive pancake was also fried, the waitress probably said at least 3 times, \"we only have one frying pan, we can't fry everything for you.\" Please tell me again how you have one frying pan, dear waitress.... We ended up cancelling one of the fried items, and getting two orders Shanghai soup dumplings.\n\nOur food came out in about 10-20 minutes. In my honest and humble opinion, I have had better dumplings elsewhere. Sorry Yelp friends, but these are definitely not THE BEST ASIAN DUMPLINGS I've had in the US. The pork dumplings with chive and with spinach were honestly a little bland, and the chive pancake was meh. They gave us a good vinegar dipping sauce though, which made these items a little better. My favorite would probably have to be the soup dumpling, which is where I allocate the extra 2-stars to. Everything else, other dumplings and service (which can be kind of expected of a Chinese restaurant - I'm not racist, I swear), was pretty sub-par.\n\nWith only one frying pan, this wasn't quite the \"Kingdom\" of dumpling I was expecting. More like \"King-dumb of Dumb-pling.\" I probably won't be coming back.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

So after watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain's show in Shanghai, I had to have Shanghai soup dumplings. The craving was just too much. Last night I put that craving to rest...for a little while.\nAnyone who knows me, knows that I do not eat Chinese food because it is so unhealthy and just not worth the salt, oil, carbs and calories in my opinion.  The dumplings here are an exception!\nThe food is delicious here. It is piping hot, light and delicate in flavor, not too oily or heavy and surprisingly not too salty.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.\n\nWe got really lucky to walk in at a time when a table was miraculously empty and no one was waiting...as we sat, it got super busy.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of food but it wasn't enough and we made the mistake of adding something towards the end which made the owner upset with us...he admonished us but it was more funny than anything.  \n\nThey really need to have a better system for the dining in set.  There is no wait list, people waiting sort of just mill among themselves and I can imagine some asshole trying to butt in line. Also some fucker keeps leaving the door open...and SO many people walk in here with their horrible kids, screaming and yelling in the tiny cramped dining area.  \n\nThe service is a bit chaotic, there was one guy going everything and we sat there without any attention for a long time at first, and the food comes out strangely slow for dumplings that I imagine are already prepped and just have to be warmed up or steamed which takes like a minute...\nthen they try to rush you out the door...Well they would not have to do that if they had a better system. Just saying. \nOh yeah, it is really cheap so I guess most of the faults are forgiven by most people who love to get yummy food for cheap.\n\nWe live too far for take out, but if you can avoid eating in, do it...\n\nSo the breakdown of my review is as follows:\nfood = 5 stars\nprice = 5 stars\nservice = 2 stars\natmosphere = 1 star\n\nAverage = 3.25", "author": "Nilu r."}

The place is a dive; it is stuffy, small and the seats are squished together. The layout of the seats are horrible and I've seen couples stuck behind a table in which they couldn't get out. Talk about claustrophobic. They have no ventilation to speak of so every bit of smoke and smell comes out of the kitchen directly to the dining room which btw is only separated by a curtain. Having said all that, this is a MUST VISIT for anyone who loves dumplings.\n\nI've tried basically all their dumplings, and all are pretty good. I'm partial to the pork dumplings since I think they have the best meat to veggie balance. The pork dumplings with napa, green chive and celery are all excellent. I usually get 1 to 1.5 orders per person, so go with friends and grab 4 or 5 orders. The XLB is ok, but not as much soup filling as other places so I don't get it anymore. But for your first visit, go for it.\n\nThe appetizers are awesome, I recommend the farmer's cucumbers (marinated in a savory/sweet/vinegar sauce), the chicken wings and the cilantro bean thread. Last but not least I highly recommend the beef stew with noodles. The soup base is scrumptious.\n\nI would stay away from the fried noodles and fried rice.

Why not 5 stars for Kingdom?  The skin is still a little thick and gets hard after sitting out for 3 minutes while skin like Ding Tai Fung or Yank Sing keep for 15+ minutes.  The meat and the soup was FANTASTIC!  The meat consistency was fluffy and not too fatty.  The soup was not too fatty which can get too overwhelming after about a dozen.  So the soup and the meat - 5stars, the skin pulled it down to 4 stars but still a hell of a soup dumpling.  \n\nBeware the lines get VERY long and there is no signup sheet so who gets in first is based on their memory and your honor system.

Although the food here was quite delicious, I had been waiting around two hours to try it. This restaurant is as big as my room (and I live in a tiny, tiny dorm.) This While ordering, there is a somewhat of a language barrier making it difficult to get exactly what you want. Do not expect quality service. They make what you order and press you to eat quickly. I advise you bring cash if you and your friends are not paying together. They don't split checks with cards, found that out the hard (expensive) way. The food itself (my favorite: Shanghai soup dumplings and need pancake) makes up for the poor service. The general cleanliness of the restaurant is pretty poor as well.

The owner is nice and apologetic for his poor service, but that's still really no excuse.  He doesn't know how to wait tables effectively, so he needs to just hire a professional waiter/waitress.  1 table of guests actually walked out the door because they waited like 20 mins to have their orders taken. Food takes FOREVER to come out.  All the dumplings should be and pre-made and should only take a few minutes (less than 5mins) to boil and re-heat.  Everything took at least 15-20mins to come out.  Very poor operations.  \n\nDECOR:\nIt is very run-down, and all the pre-decorations are still there... Thai words and signage.  Place is not the cleanest.  This is a tiny restaurant. Do not go if you have more than 3 ppl in your party. Otherwise, it will require 2 tables put together.

The Shanghai Dumplings are pretty good. The Pork/Shrimp/Chive dumplings - Nah.  The meat is rough.  We also ordered the soup noodle (flat noodle) with spinach wontons.  The flat noodle was horrible... all lumped together.  The spinach wontons were just OK.  I was somewhat disappointed all around.   Also, ditch the old menu. Your specialty is the dumplings and that's already enough to keep the cook busy... they are not equipped to serve curry, thai food, salads, etc.  It's plain stupid. \n\nPRICE:\nFor the 3 dishes I mentioned above, total bill was $20 with Tip and Taxes.

Came here with 4 people including me and here's what we ordered & what I have to say! :D\n\nFood - DUMPLINGS! DUMPLINGS!! DUMPLINGS GALORE!!! Here are the few items I had and what I have to say about them:\n- Pork & Chive dumplings (12/order): GOT TWO ORDERS OF THESE! So GOOOOOOD!!\n- Fried Shanghai dumplings (4/order): The first order of these were delicious! Soft on the outside & inside and crispy on the bottom! However, maybe they over cooked the second order of this that we got because one of them was popped and the bottom was a little burnt~~\n- Shanghai Dumplings (6/order): DELICIOUS! I would go back JUST for these! I was craving this all day and this just hit the spot! :) Wish they had some red vinegar though! (They only had the black vinegar)\n- One of their fried Rice: Was extremely full after all those dumplings... Originally, this was suppose to be a stomach filler in case we didn't get full off of those dumplings but... we were so full that we couldn't even eat much of this and ended up taking this to go~~ It was okay though... would definitely rather have another plate of dumplings instead!\n- Thai iced tea: A little on the sweet side, served in a cocacola paper cup, big cup, and definitely ghetto!! ... but delicious~ :)\n\nPrice - Reasonably priced if not cheap! 12 pork & chive dumplings for 5.95 :D Shanghai dumplings for 4.95, I believe? well, you probably get the idea. Everything is priced reasonably~ haha!\n\nService - This is one of the first places in SF that I've been to where the owners aren't cantonese! They speak mandarin but this one girl in there speaks English so fear not if you don't speak mandarin! They are very considerate too! When we went there was a small line (a group of 2 people and 4 people in front of us) but we were still waiting for 2 more people... as soon as they sat the two groups in front of us, they had a table opened and sat us down even though the other two people in our party weren't here yet. We were FREEZING outside (because there's no waiting room inside since it's a hole in the wall-like place) and it was so nice and considerate of them to let in. My friend and I decided to order first before the two other people came so we can start eating and 35 minutes later, the other two people finally came. I felt really bad because we were holding up an extra two seats when there were other parties waiting outside too~ But I guess they were seated pretty quickly too since the first dinner rush was going away. I guess my point here is that... even though the place is small, and there usually is a line, don't worry because the wait isn't that long!~\n\nAtmosphere - A hole in the wall. Super small. It looks like it's someone's garage converted into a restaurant. It's a bit stuffy inside though since the place is small and filled with hot food/dumplings, people, and steam from the kitchen but it's nice when it's cold outside because you're instantly warmed up! I do think they need a few vents though... to vent the place because the windows were so fogged up with condensation, it looked like it was raining! Haha~\n\nI will definitely come back here again when I'm back in the city! A $6 order of dumplings for lunch from here would be perfect in taste & price! :)\n\nOh yeah! They also do take out if you don't want to wait at all or if you want to eat elsewhere!", "author": "Carin S."}

Though it is small, you may have to get there early if you have a party larger than six to get seating. Still great though! Try it out!\n\nI've been there recently (March 2010) and the food is still great but the service was all bad. Go for the food not the service. The manager seems like a nice enough guy but is so rude. I was rushed through my meal and he wanted to kick my family and I out, so he could maximize his profits. A table near by didn't get a dish they ordered and wanted it off the bill, but the manager didn't want that. He quickly went over to another table that just got their dish to gave it to the table that wanted said item off the bill. EXTREMELY RUDE! The other table didn't know what to think.

We tried the pork with Napa cabbage and XLB, as well as onion pancake and shanghai donuts (altogether, a good amount of food for 2 people at $8+tax each). I thought they all tasted good and didn't really notice the more nuanced aspects such as wrapper thickness, etc. One thing that I did appreciate was that the meat was well-seasoned and well-ground, so no odd chunks of gristle were encountered. The onion pancake was tasty although there wasn't much depth (flavor-wise) to it. One great thing was that on a Sunday morning, there was only one other table there (multiple people came in for take out during the time we were there), and all of the food came out piping hot. The donut was unique - it didn't have much in the way of dough (high fried:doughy ratio), and I think on the inside was a pretty sweet black seasame paste, which I liked.\n\nAs a sidenote, what might seem to be a \"hole in the wall\" is nice and delightfully cozy when it's cold and rainy out, and not crowded inside!", "author": "Lisa K."}

The xiao long bao was ok in terms of taste, but had a grainy texture in the filling.  The pork and chive dumplings had a low meat:vegetable ratio.\n\nWe also ordered the duck curry special (comes with white rice).  The curry was nice and spicy and tasty.  The rice was solid, albeit unspectacular.  The duck though was dry and overcooked with pieces of bone and cartilage mixed in.   And no tasty duck fat!  Very disappointing considering its price ($9) relative to the rest of the menu.\n\nOverall, the meal cost $27 with some leftovers.

Few in the Bay Area has been able to touch that echelon of dumpling prowress, but Kingdom of Dumpling is probably one of the best that get as close as they can to the truly perfect, close to Asia soup dumpling. \n\nIn my opinion, when you pick up a soup dumpling, you can almost immediately tell if it's really going to be THAT good of a dumpling because the skin should sag a little with the weight of the soup, but be thin enough to make you wonder \"how the hell did they do that?\" It's a hard thing to do, but it really is one of the hallmarks of great soup dumplings. Kingdom of Dumpling achieves that and I enjoy how their dumplings are not too large nor small. Their other dumplings are also pretty good, and the radish cakes are good too - flaky on the outside but not soggy from the shredded radish within. \n\nI usually don't mind that they are kind of cramped, however I had to deduct points for when they told us mid-dumpling bite that we'd have to hurry it up/get out soon and wouldn't let us add to our order saying they had warned us (they didn't) since there were people waiting. Also, nitpicky but their tea is from teabags and not leaves, and usually incredibly weak. But overall, I really enjoy coming here - just need to make sure it's in the off hours so you don't feel like they want to kick you out mid-dumpling.", "author": "Jocelyn C."}

Here you get 6 and the other place gives you 8 XLB.\n\nThe dish of vinegar/soy sauce for the XLB is so tiny that it is hard to dip the dumplings in it.  The dipping sauce is okay, but Shanghai King on Balboa St. has a better dipping sauce. \n\n-Green onion pancake was very good and I would order that again. \n-Garlic green beans were cooked to perfection and delicious.  \n-Pork and napa cabbage dumplings was another winner and you get 12 of them.\n-Grilled lamb skewer has good flavor, but I found it to be okay...and bit tough and not tender.  I will not need to order this next time  \n-Shanghai donut  ($3.) was piping hot and you have to let it cool, but that was a nice treat if you like black bean with a flaky outside and sesame seeds on top.

I went to the Kingdom of Dumpling a few weeks ago, because the Shanghai Dumpling King is closed on Tuesdays. \n\nIf you are going to a Shanghai dumpling establishment, I would recommend sticking with the dumplings. We ordered pot stickers, and it seemed like an unnecessary filler that impeded my ability to eat more dumplings. \n\nI love the shanghai dumplings at Kingdom of Dumpling. I also enjoyed the pork dumpling with napa cabbage. The shrimp and chicken dumplings don't seem to absorb the soy and vinegar sauce as well as the pork. The chives overpower the dumpling. So, I would recommend sticking with shanghai dumplings and any dumpling with pork and cabbage. \n\nOne word of caution - you are supposed to bite the top of your dumpling off and then pour the soy and vinegar sauce into the top of the dumpling. I burnt my lip on the dumpling and it took me a couple of days to recover. Not a huge deal - I would recommend using the chop sticks to open the dumpling up and allow the steam to vent before biting into it. \n\n3 dumpling dishes should be enough for a couple. Add 2 beers to the order, and you are out for around $15 per person. Not bad! A great value.", "author": "Anne Marie F."}

The lights were off, and the only sounds were those of the other two diners slurping their noodles.  So we got sat at a table in the front corner by the window, the windowsill coated in dust and the crumbs and shedded hair of diners past to my right, the white wall behind the table spattered in old dumpling grease, broth and vinegar.  My chair squeaked too.  This didn't really bother me, but your mileage may vary.\n\nSo here's what we ate:\n\nLamb Dumplings: Yep, it was definitely lamb in there but not too strong.  They were juicy but not waterlogged and the wrappers were neither too thick nor too thin.  They went well with the hot sauce on the table and the black vinegar that the waitress brought.\n\nPork & Cabbage Dumplings in Soup W/ Noodles: If we had them on their own, they would have been a little better.  But floating in soup, their wrappers got kind of soggy.  Slices of mushroom and pieces of bok choy rounded out the soup but couldn't hide the fact that the chicken broth tasted like it came out of a can.\n\nFarmer's Cucumbers: This was probably the best thing we had.  A dish of torn cucumbers quickly marinated with garlic, sesame oil, a little soy sauce, and a dash of vinegar.  Refreshing yet deeply flavored,it was the perfect foil to the rich dumplings.", "author": "Suo L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-08", "description": "First of all, I want to preface this by saying that any review based on the \"atmosphere\" of this place is not worth reading. Its a hole in the wall joint, and if you can't appreciate those kinds of places, then IMHO - don't go. Sure theres six tables, a curtain separating the dining room from the kitchen, and grease on the walls - I'll take that any day if you give me delicious food. I'll be damned if you find food thats as fantastic at a she-she restaurant elsewhere. \n\nEver since I saw Anthony Bourdain's episode of Shanghai, I was on a quest to find the best soup dumplings in the city. And I think even if its out of the way for some, the location (cold, foggy, misting outer sunset) for the type of food you're ordering (hot, steamy, spicy goodness) makes it all worthwhile. The first time I went, I was with the bestie:\n\n- Bean Curd Noodles with Cilantro\n- Pork Dumpling with chives\n- Garlic string beans\n- Shanghai soup dumplings\n\nPerfect. I was surprised at the bean curd noodles and how much I really enjoyed them! Couldn't believe they were tofu!. Pork dumplings - hearty, delicious and FILLING. As for the garlic string beans, I couldnt believe how delicious, crunchy, and complimentary they were to our meal. Finally the soup dumplings. HOLY CRAP. He advised us to dip in the soy vinegar, bite off the top and slurp out the insides. Freaking orgasmic. Next time I went, I got the green onion pancake. HOT. as in HEAT hot. And as other yelper's mentioned, its a little bit greasy, but just the outside because they need to get that crispy exterior which I love oh so much. So give me the grease.\n\nI would give this first experience 5 stars alone, but the rest of the times I've been there, the server is always in the back of the kitchen - and I always need another beer. And ice water. So thats really the only reason it gets four stars. If it was based soley on the food - 5 all the way.", "author": "Jacklyn S."}

I've eaten here in the past (as a party of 2) and everything tasted fresh and the dumplings were definitely prepared well. They did not fall apart while holding them with chopsticks and the fillings were seasoned right.\n\nThe reason for my 1-star review is that they really disappointed me by a series of  actions. I know this place is not a big restaurant. The dining area is about as large as my living room. I was reluctant to impose upon them a larger party than 4 people, so I called to see if they would take a reservation for 5 adults and 1 child. Keep in mind, a \"no\" would have been perfectly acceptable... no hard feelings.\n\nThe day of the actual reservation, I had to change the reservation to 6 adults and 3 children. The other option would have been to place an order to go and eat at my house (I live in the neighborhood). So, I called to see if I could place an order for takeout and was told to call back later. I called back later to see if I could change the reservation to 9, instead of 6. Once again, knowing how small this place is, a \"no\" would have been perfectly acceptable as well... no hard feelings. But I was told that it would be \"no problem\". So we scrapped the idea of take out, and decided to take their word for the reservation.\n\nPacked everyone into 2 cars and drove over. We arrived at our reservation time and the dining room was at capacity; plus there were 3 parties (2-4 guests per party) waiting for tables. I walked over to the person that appeared to be in charge and asked him what the expected wait time might be. I was told it might be about 15 minutes. Under normal circumstances, 15 minutes might be OK. But there is no waiting area to accommodate 15 people in this restaurant (not criticizing... just pointing it out) and the weather was rainy and cold (about 42 degrees outside).\n\nAlso, having grown up in the restaurant business, I know when someone is ambitiously overpromising on something. 15 minutes was eagerly optimistic about getting 4 tables to clear in the right area of the dining room to accommodate 6 adults & 3 children. Also, there was no way we were going to order take out at this point. The wait time would have been too long, with the kids in tow and no place to wait... We ended up walking down to the next restaurant which I've been to many times where the service is always awesome and the food (albeit not dumplings) is always equally as good as the service.\n\nBottom line, it really pisses me off when a restaurant doesn't have the balls to say \"no\" and/or doesn't have ability to manage their reservations and seat turns effectively.", "author": "Ray C."}

I didn't expect good soup inside the dumplings but was pleasantly surprised by the absolutely tasty savory broth and meat goodies inside. We also ordered the crispy chicken wings that came slathered in a delightful subtle plumlike sauce. The chicken wings were crispy on the outside and fun to nibble and suck on the bones. Reading other yelp reviews, everyone was crazy about the lamb skewers. We ordered those too and I have to say they were the best lamb I've eaten anywhere. The first bite was so tasty that a flood of saliva rushed in my mouth. I never wanted it to end. The only misstep we made was the sesame pancake with beef order. It tasted like a weird confused salami sandwich dipped in holisin sauce. It wasn't gag inducing but it just wasn't our thing. \n\nThe prices here are reasonable. The service is ok.

Naturally I thought,  \"yay I'm next\". NO. That is not what happened. Instead a male worker came out and told me the 2 ppl who just left were sitting at a 4 person table and they had a small table to combine with it to accommodate the 6 and asked if I wouldn't mind waiting a little longer. I understood how hard it would be for them accommodate the 1st party of 6 since the place is so small so I said no, I don't mind waiting, I'll wait for the next free table since it looked like a table would free up shortly. Another 5-10 minutes passed and a large group left a girl worker came out and called the 2nd group of 6. Now this is where I got mad. I interjected and told her I've been waiting and I already gave up my table the first time and that I should be seated. Mind you, the table they were gonna give away were 2 small tables pushed together which could've accommodated my bf and I and another couple who also was waiting.

For this reason my review might be a little biased, but...amazing food is amazing food and all the Yelpers before me definitely don't have it wrong - Kingdom of Dumpling is delicious!\n\nBe forewarned this place is TINY - housing only 7-8 tables, so you have to come with the expectation that you WILL be waiting for a table, especially during lunch/dinner hours. I came here on a Saturday around 1PM and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (there were 4 parties before us). There were no sign-in sheet which baffled me a little. The owner or host spent more time trying to figure out which waiting parties were the first, so definitely there's room for improvement here. The restaruant is also minimally pleasing from a visual standpoint. Nothing really on the wall, basic tables, a couple of our plates were brought to our table with chipped edges. But if you're a frequenter of Chinese restaurants, you already know not to expect to be wow'd by decor and such.\n\nNow, ONTO the food!! We were famished by the time we were seated, so we quickly ordered: pork dumpling with chives (12), xiao long bao (6), onion pancakes, and cold tofu string noodle dish. \n\nPork dumplings were bursting with flavor and filled with chives, the dough was of the perfect consistency and thickness, not over or under floured. \n\nI loved the xiao long bao here!! They came on a steamer so lovely and steamy hot. Their xlb is incredibly soupy upon the initial bite, and the flavors were rich but overly salty like others I've had. Be careful it's piping hot at first! But after a few minutes, I was guilty of stuffing the entire little suckers into my mouth and devouring all its juicy goodness in one bite (okay a couple of bites)! Definitely one of the best xlb's I've had in the Bay area.\n\nOnion pancakes were thin, crispy and light., very delicious with my sweet soymilk.  Next time I want to try the onion pancakes stuffed with chives, they look amazing!\n\nNext time, I am coming here more starving so I can enjoy more xlb, dumplings, and onion pancakes!!", "author": "Jing D."}

They give you 6 for $6 and it's flavorful and has the tasty soup inside (magic how they do it), but it's quite small and nothing to harp about. The place is tiny (probably fits 25 people) and packed, come here with a small party, not a big one.\n\nWe ordered the shrimp and pork and chive wonton noodle soup which was really plain and lacked flavor, luckily their special house chili sauce is hot and tasty.\n\nThe XO Chow Fun is really good though. One of the better chao fun's I've tasted. That seafood sauce they put is the key touch and it's well cooked. I highly recommend it with chili sauce on top.\n\nThe waiter was beyond horrible, slow, not friendly, no recommendations. The owner was extremely friendly and jovial - so i'll give that a push.\n\nI was expecting more since I love dumplings. 3.5 Stars.

I honestly think it used to be a garage that has been transformed into a \"kitchen.\" Ok so food isn't the greatest, but it deserved more than 3 stars because of the price. The xiao long bao is uber affordable, considering Yank Sing charges $12 for about the same thing. I liked how the skin was nice and thin, and the soup stayed inside until you punctured it. The pork wasn't uber greasy which is nice. Didn't like the regular pork and napa dumpling, that skin was too thick. Scallion pancake needed more flavor, more scallions me thinks. I did like the potstickers, they took the whole time to cook it, but totally worth it - skin uber crispy while inside maintained its juiciness.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

It was about 1/3 full, which wasn't hard seeing as the place was so tiny (maybe fit 15-20 people MAX).\n\nBeef Pancake:  Hmm never thought having meat in a pancake could taste so good.

This dingy little restaurant serves some of the best dumplings in San Francisco and in such an Asian city, that's saying something. \n\nI've visited multiple times and have tried many of the menu items. My personal favorites are the Shanghai dumplings, filled with a well-made broth and the chicken and corn dumplings, very savory, yet offering the right amount of sweetness. I also like the onion pancakes which were panfried, though on occasion they are a tad soggy and need to be eaten quickly. The lamb dumplings are a touch gamey, but many people I go with prefer it as such and I don't mind either way. \n\nThe service is very accommodating, the only drawback being the lack of waiters. It is small and seems family-run. They offer frozen dumplings to go in mass quantities and it really warms my heart to see them bringing fresh, hand-made dumplings by the tray-fulls each night. They really do it right. \n\nOverall, the locale and sometimes the wait brings this down to four stars. This has nothing to do with the delicious offerings.

Chicken and spinach dumplings:  so we found out why the food was taking forever to come out.  They ran out!  It looked like they had to get more delivered.

If there are Chinese people who can dedicate an entire restaurant to dumplings, you KNOW we mean srs bsns. Stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and lucky for us, there was one table left waiting for us. Normally I'd be leaping with joy when this happens because I feel extra special, like the foodie Gods have blessed me for this exact moment. But this particular restaurant (is it even big enough to be called a restaurant?) is like the size of a closet, so the foodie Gods must have been showering me with golden rain of unicorn tears or something by leaving us this one table. There are only like 5 or 6 small tables and can probably fit like 20 people if you want to sardine it up. It reminds me of those small restaurants/food tents in China, which is actually pretty awesome because those spots usually have the best food on the low low. Anyway, we ordered: Shanghai Soup Dumplings (siu long baos), Pork & Spinach Dumplings, and Beef Pancakes. Everything came out in about 10-15 minutes which is average for dumpling cookage (my gma makes them all the time, please don't tell her about this. It would break her soul).  The siu long baos were my absolute favorite! The texture was perfection and was mouth watering delectable accompanied by KoD's own crack-like vinegar sauce. That vinegar sauce can make dirt taste delicious, oh my good god. The pork dumplings were really good too, though not as memorable.

Or get them frozen and bring them home at the same price for 22 (why not 24?). Chewy/al dente skin, tasty fillings...very yum. The price is fair, not super cheap I mean considering its location. \n\nMediocre shanghai xiaolong bao though. They looks great, but I've had better in the Bay Area. Maybe it's the skin not thin enough, maybe it's the flavor of the fillings. Either way, the price is cheap, but I probably won't order it again. \n\nSome appetizer dishes were oddly overpriced though. Like the coriander bean curd skin salad for $5.95. That's like 12 dumplings! For a mere plate of bean curd skin tossed with some oil and coriander! I guess it's my fault for ordering it. \n\nI think they place used to be a Thai fusion of some sort, perhaps? They have some leftover menu item on the Special sign and on the menu taped to the wall.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-11", "description": "The best Xiao Long Bao (XLB as some call it) I've ever had! I travel out of town a lot so every time I return to SF I have to come here again as soon as I can.\n\n**This is not to be confused with Dumpling Kingdom or House of Dumpling just one or two blocks down on Taraval.\n\nIt is a small, hole-in-the-wall, cramped, little sit-down restaurant like the kinds you get in Asia. Not meant for a long romantic dinner, business meeting, or large groups (although I've seen them accommodate up to 6-8 people at one table). You should be here only for the XLB and not for social gatherings.\n\nThey don't take reservations so if you are coming in for dinner, I recommend coming in really early like 5-6pm. If you come at 7pm or later, you will probably put your name on a really long list and have to wait out in the cold for up to 1 hour or longer to be seated and when you get seated, they might limit you to only one round (6 pieces) of XLB because they are running out.\n\nI can't say they give the best customer service by American standards. However, imho, they are pretty nice and accommodating by Asian standards. I feel bad for them sometimes because they get some nasty customers. One time this guy put his name on the list for a group of 5-8 people and asked the waiter to call him on his phone when a table frees up for them. The waiter told him they don't call customers but they can leave their name on the list. Meanwhile, he and his whole group goes around the nearby residential neighborhood laughing and joking inappropriately at an inconsiderately loud level. The rest of us on the list were waiting patiently outside the restaurant. He comes back after a long while and gets upset when he sees they gave a table to someone whose name was after his on the list. He then pesters the poor waiter for the next 5-10 minutes trying to persuade him to call him when the next table frees up, acting like he was giving the waiter a second chance. The waiter kept telling him really nicely that they never call their customers on the phone to be seated. Someone needs to be waiting outside to be called. (They don't even request that the whole party be present to be seated). The waiter finally brushes off this guy and goes inside to continue serving. The guy turns around and comments smugly to all of us waiting, \"sometimes you just got to do what you got to do to get what you want\", to which nobody responds to him. This guy has no shame. I saw a similar thing happen again at a later occasion.\n\nI have to say though, even though this place is great for XLB and green onion pancake, the rest on the menu are kind of just fillers. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a full course meal. So if you are feeling like a light, quick, cheap, filling, and absolutely delicious Asian dinner, come on in early and order some XLB! :)\n\nNote: Do not be greedy and order too many servings of XLBs though. I once did that (ordered 3 servings for 2 people) and overdid it. Didn't return for a few months until I started craving XLB again.", "author": "Liz C."}

The beef pancake was not crunchy and I don't know how to describe the flavor except it wasn't that great. The Onion Pancake was not crunchy and had no flavor, the XO Beef Chow Fun tasted worse than Panda Express if they sold Beef Chow Fun. There was no hint of XO sauce at all or perhaps their XO just means best quality and not XO sauce. My sister even asked me, was this actually cooked by Chinese people?!?! LOL. The next morning came the dumplings and wasn't that great either, the frozen stuff from Safeway and Trader Joe's tasted better. There was not even 20% shrimp in each of the dumplings which were small enough as is.\n\nSeems like people only like their hot sauce or something which means they wouldn't be able to taste the flavor of the stuff anyways.

All kinds, but I especially love the ones with soupy broth at the center of them: Shanghai Dumplings! \n\nSo, then came the day. They picked me up and after 20mins of driving, It finally occurred to me that we were not going to eat in chinatown or even the outer richmond but the outer Sunset, where parking was ample and people were scarce. Except for inside this tiny little hole in the wall of a kingdom of dumplings. \n\nAfter a 25min wait, we were seated in a small corner and wanted to order just about every variety of dumplings they offered, but we stuck to the basics: xiao long bao (shanghai dumplings), pan fried lamb and pork &chive dumplings, onion pancakes, and beef pancakes. Maybe not so basic, but Damn! They were good! Everything. Lamb dumplings are now officially my favorite. The option of pan-fry or steam is available, I'd stick with the pan-fry. Do try the beef pancake. I couldn't figure out what kind of meat was in there, but it didn't really matter while on the palate. \n\n Half the fun of eating xiao long bao is the challenge of getting the dumpling dipped in the sauce and into your mouth before it bursts and the broth is wasted on your plate. Haa, it's so much fun!\n\nThe Outer Sunset will be seeing more of me!", "author": "Deanna T."}

Being our first visit, mother and I both ordered dumplings. She had chicken and celery, I had pork and shrimp with chives. Each order came with 12 average sized dumplings.  After reading some Yelp reviews, we added an onion pancake as well. \n\nFirst off, the dumplings are made after you order which means great freshness. However, we experienced our first disappointment when it came out. The dumplings were boiled instead of steamed.  Maybe because they have to be boiled, but the wrapping or 'skin' was also really thick - like a pot sticker.  Lastly, there was very little 'soup' or yummy juices inside. \n\nHaving lived and worked in China and visited Shanghai a dozen times, I can say that the Shanghainese really do make some kick-ass dumplings.  These were not.  The mark of a great dumpling are great tasting filling (these were admittedly pretty good), super thin wrapper (because it's all about the filling), and a rich, belly-warming juice inside each dumpling.  Kingdom's dumplings only had one out of the three which makes them only mediocre.  \n\nIt's really too bad.  I hate flying 12 hours to get great dumplings.  It makes for an expensive meal.", "author": "Consumer X."}

My wife and i love to take people here, and there has never been a complaint. \n\nThere is typically a line of people waiting to get in, but its because its so small, I mean really small. There is only about 6 tables in the whole place and I'm a big guy so its a little uncomfortable. And for being such a small place i would think the service would be much better. \n\nThat aside The food makes up for all of that The dumplings are so good that it makes you want to try to make out with the older lady who served it to you, but dont she's not into that. My favs are the chicken and corn, pork and chives, and the shanghai soup dumplings are so goood! I also really like the Chicken chow mien and i don't even like chow mien.\n\nThey also have really good prices most of the dumplings are around $6 and it comes with a dozen. My wife and i can eat a hearty dinner for less than $20 and still have some left over for her to take to lunch the next day.", "author": "Troy S."}

Restaurants usually serve really thick onion pancakes - mainly just flour/dough. They would not have much flavor to it, be soggy or too burnt. But these... these were perfect. They were thin, crispy brown, and chewy. I wanted MORE!!!! \n\nWe also had the lamb skewers which you should all try. Very flavorful and not burnt unlike other places I've been to. The tofu noodles were very refreshing. \n\nI really enjoyed my time here. I was getting pretty full but I just wanted to order more onion pancakes and xiao long baos and stuff my face! \n\nThe service wasn't too bad, though they did take forever to refill the teapot even though there were only one other table in such a small area.

Well, for one, you don't accidentally burn your pan-fried dumpling like someone I know (me). Kingdom of Dumpling is one of those surprises that you find in a hole. It's a small establishment, but it serves up an array of different types of dumplings and some interesting items you don't really expect. Dinner entrees and dim sum to name the least. \n\nMy fiancee and I decided to give it a try despite my reluctance to pay someone else to cook my dumplings. We ordered the usual fare of Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Dumplings; or directly translated as Little Dragon Dumpling), Pan-Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings and a Beef Stew Noodle. The Xiao Long Bao came in half a dozen and it was simple, yet awesome! It doesn't have a whole lot of soup in it like the ones from Shanghai Dumplings on Balboa, but it was enough to hit the spot. Doesn't burst out to burn you either, so that's good if you're really hungry. \n\nThe Pan-Fried Dumplings were exactly the ones that you get from the restaurants parent company (I think) on Noriega and it's the same dumpling that I felt in love with. The pan-fried part of these dumplings weren't how I would like it: slightly burnt and crunchy. Instead, it was barely browned at the bottom. No crunch, but it's still good.\n\nThe Beef Stew Noodle has to be one of the best I had. The beef was soft and juicy, the broth was great and the noodles (flat rice noodles) were not overcooked. Good pick!\n\nThis is quite a surprise to see another hole-in-the-wall restaurant stand up against the other bigger restaurants. The interior decor is actually quite...modern...if I can say that. Service is basic, but the food is the focus. Don't expect to be treated like royalty, but just go and enjoy some good old fashion dumplings!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

The restaurant itself isn't large or dressed-up - it has maybe 6 tables at most and a mostly unadorned interior. But damn, these are the best soup dumplings I've had a chance to bite into. The one thing that soup dumplings in San Francisco have a clear advantage over those I've eaten in New York is that the skins are not as thick, and the size of the dumplings make it much easier to eat. We ordered 3 crates, and it was worth every bite. Unlike Yank Sing, where we occasionally got one with barely any pork or all pork and no soup, these had the perfect ratio and were amazingly delicious. We also ordered a platter of pork and shrimp dumplings, which were just as equally outstanding compared to dumplings I've eaten elsewhere. It was too bad it was our last day, because I would have been back for more for sure. The price is very reasonable (I think it was $5 for a crate of 6), and the lady serving us was very hospitable.\n\nThis may be quite a ways from Chinatown, but if you want good dumplings - be they xiao long bao or any other dumplings - you HAVE to come here. Out of the many, many Chinese restaurants I've eaten at, these were the best, by far. A must-eat!", "author": "Asuka N."}

After a few minutes, they gave a status report of the finishing table, letting us know that they had just received their bill and would be heading out.  Much appreciated. \n\nService was extremely prompt even with the restaurant about 80% full.  I believe the manager? was constantly scanning the room the entire time offering his friendly service to everyone in need.  He really seemed to care that people enjoyed their visit.  \n\nDumplings were very good, not the best xiao long bao I've had.. but no complaints.  Another favorite of the table was the corn dumplings.\n\nVery good beef chow fun but titling it as \"XO\" was misleading.  XO noodles are suppose to be spicy and more flavorful.  I didn't taste any XO at all.  \n\nI wouldn't get the beef noodle soup again.  Not a very rich broth and the noodles were overcooked.  \n\nThe green onion pancakes are different from the doughy flaky chewy layers I'm use to.

I still did like the chewiness of the dough and the flavor of the pork, though.\n\nThe shao bing and you tiao tasted less greasy than most, which was nice.  The chive pancake had chives and rice noodles in a fried pancake and tasted pretty good, but I was already pretty full by the time it came.\n\nWe saw another table try to order more food half-way through their meal, but the owner(?) would not let them because the line out the door was too long.  It seemed a bit weird to refuse them, but the restaurant is really small with limited seating.  The dishes themselves are all pretty small (i.e. 6 small xlb in the order as opposed to 8 larger ones at other places), and they are cheap (our total bill was only $10/ea), so if it looks crowded you may want to order more dishes than you normally would just to be safe.", "author": "Michael C."}

The art of getting the perfect bite out of you soup dumpling is to pick it up at the tip and place it on your soup spoon without breaking the skin and losing the soup. Bite the tip off first to cool it down a bit so you don't burn your mouth. Dab a little vinegar sauce and ginger if you like, and enjoy.

For that reason alone, you know I'll be back, despite this first let down. \n\nBut anyway, back to the broken heart I'm suffering. The dumplings! The dumplings, this is a dumpling house after all, right? Sorry, there was barely any flavor in them. And the little \"squirt\" dumplings are known for? Barely any in these. And the different kinds: pork, beef and the other ones- they tasted the same. I mean, a dumpling is a dumpling, we still ate them all, but to be honest, the mass produced, overpriced ones at Yank Sing tasted better. \n\nThe beef onion pancake, was what I imagine this restaurant sees as their answer to a quesadilla, in that it's flat, stuffed with meet and something holding it together, (couldn't decipher it) and it's cut like a quesadilla if that helps you envision it visually. But either way, it tasted good. \n\nPot stickers, were perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. \n\nChow fun was delicious. \n\nService was pretty attentive once you got the girl's attention.

I would come back though because I was too lazy to drive anywhere else, and because I was crazing greasy Chinese good, and because I'm not a huge crazy dumpling fan and can live with or without these anyway and eat something else on the menu that is better. \n\nIt's just sad when you advertise a \"KINGDOM\" of anything and that one specialty you have, it's just not so good. \n\nAgain, had not ever heard of the place this review would have gotten a star and a half more. And yes I'll be back because the food is decent and pretty good, and it's close to home. But again, I was so jaded by my preconceived notions I could only get let down by this review. So I ask those reading it to please when you dine somewhere or go see or meet someone, even if you have a preconceived notion of the place or person, which most of the time you can't avoid, as everyone does this, and we all judge others without the facts, can you please try and at least try to keep yourself on track to remaining impartial? If I had done this, maybe I wouldn't be so unhappy with my meal now, even though the rest of the food after the first dish was really really good.", "author": "Denise B."}

To be honest, like many others I'm sure, I laughed at the name, and already have a sense of what the place might look like, but since I'm new, I decided to be adventurous. \n\nWhen I arrived in the neighborhood, It's exactly what I had imagined, aside from that rail bus on Taravel, the area is as dead as you can imagine at night, and then there it is, the \"kingdom\".\n\nIt's such a stereo typical Chinese restaurant, red and green letters, florescent lighting, grease layer on floor / table / chair / everything, and it's more of a \"hut\" than \"kingdom\".  So I sat down and got to business, we ordered a variety of things along with dumplings,  scallion pancakes, \"sheng jian bao\" (grilled stuffed bun) fried toufu and chicken wings.\n\nThe dumplings are tasty, they're great, and I think they're handmade, or they did a really good job on getting it taste like its handmade. It reminded my toddler years in China, that's what this place is all about I guess. The wings sucked really bad, its very dry, scallion pancakes are ok, not outstanding since it's not made from scratch. fried toufu is very tasty, right amount of seasoning and not over fried.\n\nI did enjoy my evening there despite the questionable interior, the dumplings are very authentic, will definitely go back again.", "author": "Bo D."}

I think a switch should be in session haha.  Well, ultimately I would say 'Kingdom of Dumpling' IS still better.\n\nPros: Their dumplings are amazing in the sense of both quality and quantity. You really get your bang for your buck here. I've tried their assorted dumplings, curry fish balls, shaow lung bao, beef pancakes, string beans and they were all very delicious. Their Tai tea was also very thirst quenching and a sizable amount! Most importantly, I didn't feel parched after the meal! This can only mean little to no MSG and a reasonable amount of sodium. \n\nTheir service was also exceptionally well. The owner and staff were all very polite, friendly and approachable. \n\nCons: I'm very content with this place and am a fan, but grading objectively, I would have to say that the flaws include:\n \n1) Shaow Lung Bao being a bit dry / not enough pork juice/broth within \n* This problem is fixed! 3/12/2013 \n\n2) Small place to accommodate a lot of hungry people. Atmosphere could use a little work as well. \n\nDo note that there is another branch opened by the same owner on Irving street Between 20 and 21st.

I saw this place on yelp last week so I decided to give it a go. We got there at around 5:30pm. Unfortunately the place only felt a little cleaner than SDK. The waitress lady was busy prepping green beans at one of the tables as we walked in. She spoke no English whatsoever but I took it as a good sign. The food had to be legit right?\n\nDuck Curry Stew with Rice - This was one of their whiteboard specials. I'm happy they gave the option of brown rice. The curry didn't have a milk/coconut milk in it like I'm used to at Indian/Thai places but it tasted just as creamy! The duck meat was simply delicious: sweet, tender, and savory. I couldn't stop picking all the pieces out of the curry! This dish also came with big cubes of flavorful eggplant and zucchini. \n\nShanghai Soup Dumplings - These were disappointing. For $4.95 you get six dumplings. Not only is it lacking in quantity but I found the meat inside to be lacking in flavor. Which is worse? Taste for sure! I'm used to a big burst of meaty flavor swimming in broth but I didn't find it here. There wasn't even enough soup in each dumpling. \n\nPan Fried Shanghai Dumplings - Again, lacking. I had one and let my bf eat the remaining three.\n\nBoiled Chicken and Corn Dumplings - I liked their boiled dumplings better than the steamed ones. The corn was very sweet and chicken was mixed it well with the filling. I didn't want to eat them all but I couldn't resist!\n\nBoiled Pork and Napa Cabbage Dumplings - I love pork dumplings and flavor wise these didn't disappoint. I just wish the boiled dumplings were bigger.\n\nThe real verdict is 3.5 stars. But I think it could really sway from 3 to 4 stars depending on what you order.

Two pairs of socks and a few missed calls later, I was convinced I needed something warm to fill the tummy. I was not hungry enough to have hot pot so my friend easily persuaded my skinny butt to put on my not-so-skinny sweats and drive twenty minutes to Shanghai Dumpling Shop on Balboa. \n\nClosed. Not permanently. What a waste of gas. So we moved along to another dumpling place. No wait. Plenty of parking and since it is after 6, free! \n\nWalking in for the first time, there were like ten tables, most of them full. I like the crowd. Mostly young, Asian and Americans waiting for someone to take their order. There was one guy doing just that. \n\nI knew I was eating at a Chinese place when I got tea right away and had to ask multiple times for water. Now, if I had ordered a beer or a paid drink, I would have got it immediately. \n\nHere is our order. \n-XO Beef Chow Fun\n-Shanghai Dumpling\n-Pork and Chive Dumpling\n-Chicken and Spinach Dumpling\n\nThe chow fun tasted average, however, I think someone in the kitchen loves bean sprouts. I am thinking my mom was working for them because she knew how much I despise those white little things that usually goes in Vietnamese crepes. Normally, I would play with it and squeeze out the water, but there was too much of it. \n\nAs for the dumplings, we should have ordered two Shanghai and nix one of the other dumplings. It was reasonably-priced, like 7 bucks for 12 dumplings or 6 Shanghai ones. \n\nYou really had to eat it fast because it got cold pretty damn quickly and did not taste good. \n\nOverall experience...I would not wait in line longer than 5-10 minutes because Taraval is windy and the food and atmosphere was adequate but not inviting.", "author": "Thia T."}

I asked him to put it in their beef soup and he did (I expected the brown hong shao niu rou tang). Which was one of the best \"clear\" type beef soups I've had in the whole bay area.  Super peppery, and very flavorful.  I'd go back again just for  beef noodle soup.\n\n3) chive boxes (jiu cai he zi)!  Yesss!!  finally a place with chive boxes in the city!  one of my favorite northern dimsum, this is basically a huge semi-flattened pan-fried dumpling with no meat inside, just chives, eggs, glass noodles, maybe some little dried shrimp.  So good.  And it was pan fried and not the lame deep fried style.\n\n4) beef pancakes (niu rou xian bing).  I actually expected this to be the beijing style \"hockey-puck\" type dimsum (like A&J and Darda have), but it ended up being halfway between that type and the really flat one they have at old mandarin.  I much prefer the hockey-puck style that has soup inside, but ah well.  It was still tasty, and I think better than Old Mandarin's which is too greasy for me.\n\n5) shredded daikon pastries (luo buo si bing).  TASTY!  these had little chunks of ham in the shreds inside, and was moist.  Usually this pastry is too dry because of the flaky pastry around the daikon.  But they got the balance here.  I was very impressed!  Baked and not too greasy, I always feel good after eating these.\n\n6) potstickers.  These were sealed, unlike what I'm used to from most northern places (which is usually just folded in half with the meat exposed to keep it dry).  But it was still good, since there was soup inside!  definitely better than the stuff the cantonese folk make in most places in SF.\n\n7) the owner made a creme brulee for us, which he boasted was made from real vanilla beans.  He blowtorched outside of the kitchen as a show, and handed it to me.  tasty, but I've had better.  for 3.95, it's not so bad though.\n\nI'll be back for some beef noodles.  And some of the other snacks for sure.  The green onion pancakes looked quite good.  They were pan-fried and looked layered like they should be.\n\nThe food was very tasty--I now have a new go-to spot for chinese \"flour food\" in SF!", "author": "Fong L."}

I was forewarned by a friend that its not as good as it used to be but I did not believe them....\n\nThey were right. It was disappointing. Although the pork and napa dumplings are just good as before, the potstickers and pancake have gone down hill. The sad thing is, its not the quality of the actual ingredients but the carelessness of the way it was cooked. Instead of being golden and crisp on the panfried side, it was rushed so it was barely beige and flat. No crisp at all, almost soggy.\n\nOverall, this place has become \"okay.\"  If you don't eat this type of food often it might be \"great\" but i love potstickers/dumplings so I know it should be better!  I think its because so many people come here to eat now that they just rush to get your food to you quick so you can go and they can seat the next group of people waiting. Quality is sacrificed for fast turn over. Perhaps it will be good if you come during slow hours. \n\nDefinitely not better than Din Tai Fung!

I love the dumplings at Kingdom of Dumpling/Asian American Food Company on Noreiga.  I suggested to them that they should open up a restaurant, since some people, like me, are lazy and want cooked dumplings.  Well, they did it!  They took over David's Kitchen on Taraval (though they may have kept David's menu - I'm not sure since I never went to David's Kitchen).  You can get their dumplings there, as well as dim sum (e.g., various Chinese pancakes), noodle soups and more.  \n\nRight now there's one server and he's nice but service is slow.  It takes a long time for the tables to be cleared.  Hopefully, they'll get faster with time.  It's a small place with 10 tables and only one tiny stove.  I wouldn't come here with a large group.\n\nI ordered dumpling soup (pork with cabbage) with wide rice noodles, to go (they didn't include utensils).  I knew the dumplings would be great , very juicy and flavorful, with thicker skins (handmade by Chinese women).  There weren't enough of them but it was a delicious bowl of noodle soup.  The broth was very light.  The rice noodles tasted fresh.  It came with thinly sliced shitake mushrooms and bok choy.  \n\nI hope they can improve the service and thrive in this spot.  Dumplings + creme brulee at the same restaurant?  Works for me.\n\nUpdate:  The lamb and pork dumplings are better than the chicken ones.  The onion pancake tastes like mum's but thinner.  It's not oily and has a nice crispy exterior.  Could use a little more salt and I hardly ever say that.  The beef tendon noodle soup has tasty broth and quality cuts of tender beef but we didn't like the noodle that it came with (some wheat noodle that was too soft).  XLBs are good - quite juicy, could use some more salt too.", "author": "Lolia S."}

There aren't windows and the only fresh air you get is the air that blows through from the door opening. It also doesn't help that the dumplings are fresh hot and steamy . \n\nThough I was slightly uncomfortable, the food definitely made up for it. I ordered green onion pancake, pork and shrimp dumpling, soy milk, chinese doughnut, and XO beef chowfun. The green onion pancakes get 3 stars. They tasted good at the first bite but the taste doesn't exactly last. I would have liked the pancake to be just a little crispier even though I usually prefer soft foods. The pork and shrimp dumplings were good. I was glad it wasn't soupy because i didn't end up with a burned tongue surprise. The soy milk was not as sweet as I would have liked but it was light and just right. It was great with the chinese doughnut. The XO beef chowfun was also good but a little oily. However, whenever you eat chowfun, it should always expect oil since the noodle itself is already oily. It also had a nice kick from the XO sauce and it had a hint of spiciness. \n\nIt was great because during my visit, the owner came in with trays of freshly made dumplings and fresh it did taste!

These homemade dumplings are filled with a variety of meats.  A plus is they do know how to make good dumpling skin (not too thin where it will puncture, but not too thick where it overwhelms the dumpling).  We ordered the lamb and their signature napa cabbage and pork dumplings.  Both were good, the technicality was definitely there with the meat being juicy and the skin retaining that heat.  But the taste, well, it just didn't wow me.  We also ordered their cucumber and spicy beef tendon for appetizers.  The beef tendon was really salty, but the cucumbers were very fresh and have some garlic drizzled with some soy sauce.  \n\nOne of our servers, who I assume is the owner, wasreally friendly and liked to push us to add more dishes, very slick salesman indeed.  \n\nOverall, Kingdom of Dumplings is good, but I must have been spoiled by some amazing dumplings made by my family, so I think they have already set the bar for me.

All sides of this tiny sunset hole-in-the wall advertise these claims and as I was waiting for my order most recently, I confirmed the honor. \n\n   This is a no frills dumpling house. It's tiny and usually a bit crowded but the people eating there are there for a good reason. They serve the best Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings, which I will refer to as XLB from now on) I've had in the bay area. The XLB are perfectly cooked with just the right thickness of skin meat:broth ratio. I could eat at least three orders of these on my own. They are simply fantastic.\n    Also not to be missed is the beef chow fun. The noodles taste fresh and the sauce is not as greasy as it might typically be. The chow fun also pairs very nicely with their spicy chili sauce that they have out on each table. \nThere traditional dumplings are served in many different varieties. One can get pork, beef and carrot, shrimp and a few other combinations. I've tried the shrimp and the beef/carrot and they were both excellent. The potstickers are another item that you should try. I don't usually eat potstickers because I'm not a fan of such thick skin on dumplings but these were very good. \nThe food overall is very good. I am willing to come back again and again for all of these tasty dumplings.\nWe did have a bit of an issue with service though on my first visit here with my parents. My parents have their own bamboo baskets to steam things (like XLB) so my mom wanted a (frozen) order to go. The owner brought out a cooked order to go and argued with my mom for way too long over a $6 order of dumplings. At one point my mom said, \"you keep my money and the dumplings and the next time I come you can give me the frozen ones,\" since by now they said they didn't have any frozen XLB available. With this the owner retorted, \"well who's gonna pay for these?\" Needless to say I was really put off with this. I was surprised a restaurant owner would argue at such lengths over an order of dumplings and what seemed to be a simple misunderstanding. Only after my mother had completely given up did they bring out a pink Chinese bag full of the dumplings (not even wrapped they were just thrown in there).\nI will mention that I came back the following weekend with a friend and the service was great, but that initial experience was just not great. \n\nHopefully your first experience will be more like my second and whatever you do, don't try to order ANYTHING to go!", "author": "Egan B."}

The xiao long bao is the best, and the pork and shrimp with chives dumplings are also very good.  I like them steamed rather than pan-fried.  The green onion pancake is so--- good, I prefer it to the beef pancake.  The beef stew noodle soup could be a little more rich and hearty. The cold beef tendon seemed to be a fave among many in our party.\n\nThey've got some random items on the menu  (creme brulee, rack of lamb with mashed potatoes?) but it actually looked tasty.\n\nThe owner is a hoot- half the time I can't make out what he's saying, but he is just so adorable!", "author": "Amina B."}

My boyfriend and I read really good reviews about this place so we purposely made a trip to sf just to try it.  After going through the trouble of getting lost, parking far and walking to the restaurant we felt obligated to at least try the dumplings even though the place was disgustingly dirty.  There were food crumbs all over the floor, the table clothes were drenched in soy sauce, the waiters wore dirty aprons, our utensils were dirty and our cups floated with gunk.  It seems as if some frat boys made a bet to see how long they could go before feeling the need to clean the restaurant.  To top it all off, the dumplings weren't even great. I don't understand what the hype was all about.  Highly disappointed.", "author": "Karen D."}

Now there's Kingdom of Dumpling which allows me to have them morning, noon, and night; dim sum is usually only for the morning and brunch time... KD also have like ten different kinds of dumplings, from veggie to lamb (mehhh mehhh!!!), Chinese savory pancakes, soup and stir fried noodles, and a bunch of random northern Chinese foods... \n\nFood: \n* Shanghai dumplings - there's too much of the skin/wrapping of the yummy filling, it's like they're trying to make them look bigger than they actually are! Darng-it! But otherwise it's the perfect flavor and texture of the filling, which goes amazingly with the Chinese vinegar!!!!! \n* Lamb dumpling - yummy \n* Green onion savory pancakes - yum \n* Beef savory pancakes - yummier!! \n* Seaweed salad - yuck! Has a nice crunchy texture and interesting flavor as you're eating it, but once you done there's this weird fishy taste that's left in your mouth... \n* some noodle soup - simple and good. Don't expect lots of spices and flavor like Vietnamese pho, but it has it own simple northern China flavors \n* Beef chow fun - its so fun!! (and yes I did...!) a little on the greasy side, but good stuff. \n\nDrinks: \n* Hot soy milk - must try! \n\nDessert: \n* Creme Brulee e- Our waiter told us that we should try it, but it just didn't seem right. One day, maybe........... \n\nThe space is small, has only about six tables, but it feels like you're going over to a friends place to eat.

We ordered shanghai dumplings, pork dumplings, green onion pancake, chow mein and pork skewers. We got the first 3 items right away and we started eating. After we finished with that we were pretty much full and feeling like we've waited enough for the rest of our food to come so we asked to cancel the order since it seemed like they haven't even touched it yet but they freaked out and said no no and went right away to throw our order together. Kind of bullshit, you don't go make the food right when I say something, I wanted to cancel the order and just go but you made us stay for that crap which wasn't that good. The lamb skewers were over seasoned and too peppery, not moist. The chow mein was standard but I would have liked to have it accompany the whole meal which it did no so we were too full to eat any of it when it finally arrived. But even if we still had room it was forgetable. The dumplings were also not that good. They feel apart easily and were hastily made it seemed. The taste was okay but their sauce was overly vinegary to the point where it was almost unedible. I've had better dumplings at other places in sf to be honest. Just the mix of service which was lacking considering it was such a small place and they had more than enough employees working to cover it, the kitchen not being organized to send out food for tables and the lackluster taste of the dumplings when we got them. I was disappointed when leaving. It's a decent place for a bite to eat. If you have to wait forever to come here maybe more than 30 mins then go elsewhere, you are probably better off. Not terrible but definitly not the best either.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

It was not easy getting here but I'm glad hubby got around various traffic hot spots so that I won't be disapponted - yes, my hubby is a keeper.\n\nDrove around only once and found a space just one block away.  A true hole in the wall - there are only 10 tables of 2.  Lucky for us, a table just left before we walked in so we just waited for them to clear the table before settling down.  While waiting, we saw all the goodies other patrons are eating...\n\nThere are some specials on the white board - duck breast, curry lamb, red snapper...huh?  After dinner, the owner told us he was keeping the previous owner's menu but most people come for their dumplings, as they should!\n\nAnyway, there is a one page breakfast and snack menu on the table under the glass top.  We were also given a 1 page front/back menu that were categorized by dim sum (appetizers), dumplings - the most assortment I've seen, soup noodles, fried rice/chow fun/chow mein, dessert.\n\nAfter much debate, we decided on:\npork elbow (suggested by owner) - $5.95 - thinly sliced pork elbow with skin over a bed of spring mix served with a plate of soy vinegar with garlic - very tasty and perfect consistency, skin was chewy while meat was tender. \n\npork and chinese spinach dumpling - yum, love the skin!  filling was tasty and love the juice.\n\ntendon noodle soup - nice broth, lots of tender tendon, some thick shitake mushroom slices, Shanghai bok choi and some chewy homemade noodles.\n\nxlb - smaller but tasty.  \n\npan fried shredded turnip pastry - it's totally not what I had in mind, i thought it was more like turnip cake.  the filling was good but i really don't like the pastry shell so hubby cleaned this plate\n\nI'm certain they make their own chili sauce - the color is light orange - it was tasty, like a mix of sriracha with garlic paste or something.  \n\nThey also carry a decent selection of bottled beer - Anchor Steam, Tsing Tao, Sapporo, Heineken, Sin Ha, Bud? \n\nThe owner took our order and came out to talk to us when we were done.  Asked if we enjoyed our meal.  Told us the dumplings are homemade.  Asked us how we know about them - told him Yelp.  He suggested we try the breakfast items next time as they serve it all day!\n\nThe younger waiter is not very attentive nor quick but I guess you don't come for the service but the food.\n\nA wonderful evening that filled our stomachs, all at $36 - can't complain.", "author": "Gloria H."}

You can tell a lot about a dumpling by the texture of the dough! the skin of the dumplings here are thicker than other places. Me personally prefers them to be a bit thiner like the traditional ones. However, the inside of the Shanghai dumplings here are super juicy! Watch out for the soup that is contained inside which will burn your tongue, so let it sit for a bit before consuming. They give you dark vinegar dipping sauce which is a delicious pair. The other dish that is good is the pork/shrimp chive dumplings. \n\nThe service you get is is not bad, but isn't great. Make sure you let the people know you're waiting for a table at night time because they don't have a wait list.

OH MY GOD... The meat! Um.... Is it just me, or could this also be an advertisement for a sex toy? \n\nAnyways... MOVING ON! \n\nJoe's Shanghai will forever be my favorite, but since they have yet to open a location in San Francisco, Kingdom of Dumpling is now my go to place for yummy xlb. The interior isn't nothing to get excited over and they crammed as many tables as possible in such a small space. Don't be surprised if you end up having to share a table with someone either. The service is actually very good for an asian place and the waiter is pretty funny. At one point he walked over to my table, asked how everything was then said to me while making a hand to mouth gesture in my direction \"smooth. very smooth\", but since he has a very thick accent, it sounded more like \"smooooooooze. beri beri smoooooooze.\" I thought he was talking about the dumplings so I agreed, yep, they are very smooth and yummy! Later my boyfriend corrected me and said \"I think he was talking about the way you use your chopsticks...\" Ooooook... Funny guy. \n\nWe had one order of xlb (6 for $4.95), one order of pork and chive dumplings which I think came about 12 to an order and cold wide noodle which tastes EXACTLY like the cold jellyfish dish, but is just really good cold noodles.

So why just 3 star?  \n\nLet's go over the food and how each one was:\n1) We ordered the pork and shrimp dumpling - very good; tasted fresh, not over seasoned, not oily (alot of places make juicy dumplings that are caused by the addition of lots of fat and these dumplings weren't like that at all).  Would order it again and maybe try a different flavor dumpling next time.\n\n2) Baked turnip cakes - very flaky; not overseasoned; would order it again; menu said there are 2 cakes, but 3 came out.  Not sure if they just adjusted the order to 3 cuz we had 3 people or if they charged me extra.  (They didn't itemize the bill, which was not very good and we had to guess if the amount was around what we'd expect.)\n\n3) Cold wide bean noodles - average; over powering taste of wasabi and raw garlic was not minced fine enough, but an interesting dish that is refreshing on a hot day; probably won't order it again\n\n4) Chicken and spinach wonton in wide noodle soup - wontons were very good; the noodles were slighlty below average; i would order wontons again w/out the noodles next time\n\n5) Pancakes stuffed with chives, egg, pork - very good, not greasy, very fresh, not overseasoned; would order it again\n\nOverall: All the dishes came out piping hot which is very important!\nHere's the things I didn't like that resulted in the 3 stars:\n\n1) The place is small and we just had 3 people which required moving tables together already.  Most people who came here are more than parties of 2 and they had 7 tables set up for parties of 2 and 1 table that can seat 6 to 7 people.  At a point during our meal, they had to bring folding chairs for the bigger party which to me seems not very professional to have to sit on folding chairs\n\n2) As a result of being a small place and there were customers waiting, we were rushed out with a check.  Granted they apologized for rushing us out, I don't like feeling rushed out.\n\n3) The place didn't feel extremely clean.  There were spots on the chopstick holder.\n\nTotal bill $37 including tips and tax already.  Not overly expensive for lunch for 3 people.\n\nThis restaurant has more of a hole in the wall feel, family runned, and feels like good comfort food.

Pretty simplistic menu with a dumpling galore section. 16 different steamed dumplings (can be ordered pan fried, written in Chinese on the menu).\n\nWe tried:\nXiao lung bao - \n2 orders, each order comes with 6 pieces. Meat filling was too lean I thought, could use a bit of fat for better texture. Juice inside doesn't have the usual depth of soup flavor that the better ones have. Skin was thin, chewy in the good way, and had enough tension to hold the soup in without breaking while being held up by a pair of chopsticks. And for some magical reason, none of the bao stuck to each other . . . they might have brushed the baos lightly with some shortening. They were a joy to handle.\n\nChicken and corn steamed dumplings\n- Pretty good. Good for my mate who doesn't like eating mammals.\n\nChives and Shrimp steamed dumplings\n- I liked this one better than the chicken and corn one. It's approaching San Tung's\n\nGrilled skewered marinated lamb\n- This one for me was the experience defining dish. It was heavily marinated with a thick layer of black pepper coating. YUMMIE! I loved it! There's even some fat attached to the lamb meat.\n\nChives Pancakes\n- Standard fare, not the best, not the worst.\n\nService was pretty attentive. The Chinese dude was very friendly but he was also on his cell phone 50% of the time. I wasn't bothered by it. Check was $40+ for two but we do eat like pigs. $4.95 for 6 xiao lung bao was also approaching Shanghai 1930's $10 for 8. Shanghai 1930's XLBs are the best so far, in the city.\n\nSome of you are raving about the xiao lung bao at Yank Sing but I wouldn't even call'em xiao lung bao when they serve'em with RED VINEGAR!!!!!

We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings (6), Shanghai fried soup dumplings (4), bamboo shoots, green onion pancake (1), sweet soy milk and the corn and pork dumplings (12).  We weren't even going to order the corn and pork dumplings, but one of the waiters insisted we order one of their special dumplings...how could we resist the charming limited English speaking man?  The food came in waves, which worked out alright...  \n\nHere's the verdict:\n- Shanghai soup dumplings:  My fave out of the bunch!  Best when enjoyed pipping hot, and you use your Asian soup spoon to catch the soup that comes out with every bite.  Didn't need the soy sauce vinegar, ginger concoction to flavor.\n\n-Shanghai fried soup dumplings:  My least fave of the 3 types of dumplings we ordered.  The casing was too bao like and the filling less dynamic and less soupy than the non-fried counterpart.\n\n- Bamboo shoots: Nicely sauteed or tossed w soy sauce, scallions, ginger and garlic (the last two are my guesses).  Tasty and served as a cold appetizer.  It's a huge portion; a huge heaping mound on a small plate.\n\n- Green onion pancake: Pretty standard, nothing to sing home about.  It's definitely more oily and well fried than doughy.\n\n-Sweet soy milk: Standard, and wasn't actually served very warm.  I bet it's warm and fresh in the AM. \n\n- Corn and pork dumplings: By the time these came out we were getting stuffed from the aforementioned goodies.  We ate maybe 2 each.  These definitely tasted best w/ the soy sauce concoction.  I wish we ordered one w/ leeks or something cause the corn is not a good pork dumpling compliment.\n\nIf I wasn't so packed in and almost inside the kitchen area...I would give them the final .5 to make 4 stars.

In fact, there was so much brown greasy residue on the damn things that it looked like they used them to clean out the grease traps.  The carpets reeked this indescribable smell, something between homeless-scalp and gymsocks that have been reworn for weeks - then dipped in turpentine.  \n\nThe lady who served us was nice, but she spoke only in Cantonese (possibly).  So of course my wonton soup that came out (like 45 min later) was the wrong thing.  Oh well, I didn't really care, since I was so hungry.  I took my first sip.\n\nGAH.  The soup was essentially just hot water with hints of salt and sulfur with few wonton floating limply at the surface along with a couple ribbons of green onion.  I had about two sips (the second sip was just to make sure this was a gross as I thought it was).  \n\nI bit into the soggy wonton next.  The casing dough was super thick and soggy, and had no textural bite at all, in fact it just sort of disintegrated in my mouth.  Note the distinction between \"disintegrate\" and \"melt\" - kobe beef melts in your mouth, while, say, toilet paper disintegrates.  This was on the toilet paper side of the spectrum.\n\nThe wonton's filling was almost depressing.  It was as if I was a guest in a farming family's home (who had fallen upon bad times), who tried to make wonton but only had old vegetables and weeds to fill them with.  I immediately thought of this while I was biting into this pitiful dumpling and just couldn't take it anymore.  As soon as my girlfriend was done with her 4 or 5 sips, we just left a twenty, which was way more than what the meal actually cost, and shot out of there.\n\nYikes.  But at least I didn't get sick, I'll give them credit for that, definitely.", "author": "Thomas M."}

In particular, I miss the xiao long bao, eight of which could be bought for 5 kuai (around 75 cents.) So, I grabbed my Shanghainese friend and headed to Kingdom of Dumpling for some xiao long bao and other goodies. \n\nThough dive-y, this place seems pretty popular. Although we were promptly seated when we arrived at 7, just 15 minutes later, a line formed out the door. Our waiter was not necessarily rude but very curt...just like in Shanghai! Unfortunately the food wasn't as authentic as I had hoped it to be. We started off with the cold beef tendon appetizer which was really unpleasantly salty. I do NOT recommend it. Next came the fried chive pockets (?) or jiu cai he zi. This, while pretty greasy, was actually surprisingly good especially because it came out hot and fresh. I was really looking forward to the fried dumplings or sheng jian bao but instead of being filled with juicy goodness, the insides were dry while the outer buns were soggy. Weird, right? The waiter brought out our two baskets of xiao long bao last. While the baos themselves were filled with flavorful soup, my friend and I both agreed that the skin was a little too thick. \n\nOverall, it wasn't bad. Though I literally ended up paying 20 times more than I would have paid in Shanghai, I do realize that my China days are behind me and admit that the offering at Kingdom of Dumpling is a passable substitute, at least on this side of the Pacific.", "author": "Courtney C."}

The garlic string beans are also very delish and a great accompaniment to the dumplings.  The lamb skewers are good as well.  The hot sauce on the tables is very addicting, not sure what is in it.

I was a bit skeptical because I've tried a lot of dumplings in the bay area and never been completely satisfied with the results. My mom makes some of the best dumplings from scratch so that's probably one of the reasons why I'm so picky with my dumplings. \n\nAfter reading the reviews on yelp, we had to get xiao long bao and we were not disappointed. It's top 5 xiao long bao's I've ever tasted and I've had some good ones in Taiwan.  It was pretty hot so careful when you bite in or a burst of hot soup might burn you. The top part had a very thick piece of dough, which was kind of a disappointment. I guess if you ate the whole thing at one time you wouldn't notice. We also ordered the pork dumplings with corn, shrimp with chives, pork dumplings with green beans, green onion pancake, beef tendon noodle soup and the marinated cucumber salad which was a special not on the menu. The cucumber salad was pretty standard but I love having this dish with dumplings. They give you a pretty good amount (we got a bigger plate than the one pictured), not like other restaurants that only provide a small plate. It wasn't marinated long enough for my tastes though. The pork dumplings with corn was probably the best out of the 3 types we had. It had a little bit of sweetness to it and it was very tender. The pork and green beans were also very good. The green beans were a nice addition and added some great texture to the dumplings. I'm not a huge chives fan so I did not enjoy the shrimp and chives. It did not include very much shrimp and a whole lot of chives. The green onion pancake was not that good and for the price, I expected something heavenly.  It was pretty thin, not that crispy and pretty bland.  I wouldn't order it again.  Finally, the beef tendon noodle soup was pretty good. The soup wasn't salty but had some good flavor. The tendons were melt in your mouth delicious and the noodles were very fresh. I definitely want to go back and try their beef noodle soup and other types of dumplings.", "author": "Ken W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-28", "description": "I've had dump(r)ings far and wide.  My mother and grand mother, of course made the best. ;-)  However, in my quest for the way \"mom used to make\" dumplings has at least for the time being ceased with the discovery of Kingdom of Dumplings.  Arguably, I find non-Catonese regional type Chinese cuisine best outside of San Francisco, sadly.  With the high ratio of Asian-Chinese in San Francisco, one would think that the caliber of Chinese food would rank very high here.  IMHO, not true.  A few really good Cantonese do exist here, but I get burnt out on this regional style pretty quickly and am left with few other choices.  Since my family originally came from the north, I had the chance to often experience those great regional dishes during family pow-wows while I was growing up.  Unfortunately these non-Cantonese dishes are tough to find outside of family get togethers, of any note anyways, in the Bay Area. \n\nKingdom of Dumplings' first, foremost, and most important aspect is simply the food.  The space itself is small, often crowded, and if you are unlucky enough to sit by the door during a cool or cold day, you'll get a blast of the weather in your back if seated there.  Its about a 5-6 out of 10 in the upkeep department, BUT back to the food.  Of the half dozen or so restaurants in SF that I've tried which offer dumplings, any of them are a distant runner up to Kingdom of Dumplings.\n\n\n\n1) The wrappers are fresh and thicker than \"store bought\".  Think of fresh made pasta over boxed, or even frozen.  That subtle difference adds to the higher standard and finesse of the dumplings here.\n\n\n2) The fillings from chicken to pork and even lamb are just the right balance to the wrapper.  The ground meat is the right coarseness, not so minced, pasty, or under volume like some of the other dumpling houses in the City.  The supporting ingredients like green beans, cabbage, chives, and even corn illustrate the wider variety offered here.  Along with the \"classic\" filling combos,  I tried the chicken with corn filling dumplings for the first time there and was surprised at how good there were.\n\n\n3) They are boiled for just the right amount of time so they are not under or over cooked.\n\n\n4) The numerous side dishes are also well prepared, fresh, of good portions , and are competent co-stars.  Try some of the tofu based cold side plates.  The garnishes of cilantro, sesame oil and other ingredients are a tasty mix.  The green onion pancakes(like a Chinese flat bread, similar in some ways to paratha) here are the most home style in preparation I've had.  Most places that even offer this side dish over fry if not seemingly \"deep fry\" them into over greasy crackers.  Perhaps an over white-ification take on this classic dish.\n\n\n\nI did try a few of the soup noodle dishes and this would not necessarily be my first Chinese noodle place to go to(the best non-Caontese style I've had is actually in Irvine, CA), but there were very good, just not as stellar as the dumplings.  I have not tried the wonton soups there and will give those a try the next time out there.\n\nThe star dish of many dumpling houses is the \"Shanghai Soup\" style or \"Xiaolongbao\".  Outside of Ding Tai Feng(dumplings extraordinaire!) in Shanghai itself, these were the best I think I've had in CA.  For instance, the ones served at the restaurant out on Balboa pale in comparison.\n\nThe beer is served nice and cold, the owner who seems to be the point man server was polite and moved quickly to get dishes to his guests.    When we left on the 2 occasions we've been there, he was courteous, polite and grateful.\n\nWe are big fans of this place.  I would say one of the dangers is coming too often and getting burnt out on dumplings, but save this joint for those meals when you want Chinese, something a bit out of the ordinary and very nicely done.\n\nBTW, they offer flash frozen dumplings to take home and cook up fresh yourself.  We haven't tried these yet, but will see how the cook up soon.\n\n\"My kingdom for a dumpling\"  call to arms has been found at \"Kingdom of Dumplings\".  Really good place.  If you're looking for this style of Chinese food in SF, this is pretty much THE joint.", "author": "Patrick M."}

From what we heard from both the folks waiting patiently on the sidewalk and from the wait staff, there is always a line to get in.  The reason?  The restaurant is quite small, perhaps 10 - 12 tables and that resulted in a hour long wait.  Previous posters who called it a hole in the wall are spot on, there is nothing at all fancy about the place. It wouldn't be mistaken for Yank Sing.   When they called our name we entered and were met by a rush of steam, so much that my glasses steamed up.  What a contrast to the chilly summer air ~ !  Once we were inside eating we could see just why this place is considered to be the best dumpling place in San Francisco. The food was sensational in very respect, served fresh and steaming.  As this was our first time here, the waiter made some suggestions which proved to be excellent.  The saut\u00e9ed green beans and the cucumber dish were to die for.  The beans were hot, spicy and crispy, and the cucumbers were sliced cold, in a briny sauce, and it was a wonderful.  The hot sauce condiment on our table was also unique and fiery hot. The pork and shrimp dumplings were a huge portion, maybe 15 dumplings, the soup dumplings were suburb, and the onion cakes were among the best we've ever had. a throwback to the legendary Shem's in Albany in the East Bay where we were first introduced to them in the late 1970's.  The pot stickers were also very good.  I think the reason why all of these dishes were so good, is because they are freshly made.  The pot stickers, in particular, tasted as if they were created right before they arrived at our table. \n\n\nBe prepared to wait.  I quickly learned the ritual that fans of this place use which is to sign in before you park your car, and if you visit before the evening check out the cool shops that line the neighborhood.  I realize that some folks might be turned off by the hole in the wall atmosphere.  But this is what gives Kingdom of Dumplings it's charm.  It's an authentic San Francisco joint as the line of patrons waiting to get in as we left surly confirms.  It is definitely worth the wait and you'll be rewarded with the best dumplings in San Francisco.", "author": "Nick C."}

I actually like the cramped space, oil on the walls, and sticky tables. Places like this usually have the best Xiao Long Baos.\n     And BOY do they do the Xiao Long Baos RIGHT. The soup in the dumpling is the most flavorful that I've ever had. When it explodes in your mouth, it IS how others would describe...orgasmic. The skin was soft and delicious, but 2 out of the 6 dumplings broke (even with my surgeon fingers) and let out some of the juices. The portion size was also pretty poor, providing only 6 per order.\n     Other than the Xiao Long Baos, the menu was extremely limited. My favorite Red Oil Wantons were not offered. The shrimp and chive dumplings were ok. The skin was soft and sturdy, the chives were fresh, but the shrimp was nowhere to be found. The Cilantro Tofu Noodles had good flavor, was light and refreshing, but was a little too firm.\n     At this point, it was another HOUR before the next dish came. The green onion pancake was thin and soft, as opposed to thick and flaky. (I like both versions) The pancake was well seasoned and had bold green onion flavor. But SERIOUSLY? an HOUR? The sesame pancake with marinated beef also had nice flavor. However, there was a noticeable lack of sesame and the beef was very soggy.\n     Overall, the Xiao Long Baos are up there, rivaling anything I've ever had. However, the other dishes are a far step down. I did come for the Xiao Long Baos, but variety is still necessary for a complete dining experience. I come to places like this expecting questionable service, but I'll have to see whether I have to wait another hour for a green onion pancake next time.", "author": "Siao W."}

This place is dirty, staff is ridiculously snobbish, and they always pack us like sardines. I've seen them seat 6 people in a 4 people table before and I was so tempted to tell them that they're violating the fire safety code. One time when I was waiting in line, I heard a customer asking the boss to order him some additional food and the boss refuses, telling him that there's a long line and he should have ordered it in the beginning. I can't believe what I heard and I can't believe that customer didn't raise a fit either. When I sat down, I ordered 3 dinners and 2 appetizers for our family of four (2 adults and 2 young kids). The waitress has the nerve to tell me that it's not enough. She was very pushy and insisted that I order more. I told her \"No, that's plenty for us already as my kids aren't going to eat much!\" I can understand if I had only ordered 1 dinner and 2 apps, but I ordered a good amount and we ended up boxing a lot of the left overs anyway. \n\nI came back with 2 other coworkers a month later and the similar thing happened.

My coworkers said not to argue with them because she doesn't want them to spit in our food. I can't believe it! The owner must have asked his staff to aggressively force people to order more since their place is so small and they want to maximize their profits. The owner is really annoying.

Pork, beef, chicken, lamb (wait...is that a lyric from a song from 'Mulan'?) For an 8.5 x 11 sheet, the dumpling menu takes up the lower half. \n\nReplacing the defunct 'David's Kitchen', KoD is doing ok, but not spectacularly. Not much has changed decor wise, and I really didn't think in a residential neighborhood, for a restaurant that is basically in the basement of a 1500 square foot house, expansion opportunities were extensive. \n\nWe arrived on a Friday-and all was quiet except for a table of three girls talking some major gossipy smack. The chef is singing what sounds like Chinese opera. Uh-oh. The owner/head waiter was quick to point out a couple of things. First of all, almost all items from the DK menu are still available. And he was sure to show us the fresh dumplings prior their hot water bath. (I guess to let us know they're not frozen) We had:\nPork and chive dumplings\nXiao long bao\nLaquered chicken wings\nDuck curry w/ brown rice\nBeef tendon noodles\n\nFirst up: the pork and chive dumplings. These were delicious. Served with soy and vinegar with fresh ginger julienne pieces, they were hot and juicy. I think there were 9 to the order. Good start. Next up, the hot, tangy almost candied chicken wings in their sweet sticky sauce. Good good stuff. Not crusted or anything, just hot chicken with a crispy sticky glaze. \n\nNext the duck curry. If there's one thing I really admire about this place, it's their curries. They're not thick with coconut milk-but hot, savory, the tiniest bit sweet, herbal (basil) and served with chunks of tender meat (duck in this case), potatoes and zucchini. The sauce is really delicious; perfect with nutty brown rice. The beef noodle tendon is sadly, forgettable. The soup is really light and faint after the strength of the curry. \n\nLast to arrive: soup dumplings. \nBoo...first of all, soup dumpling roulette ensues. First dumpling-NO SOUP. Next dumpling: hot, tongue searing soup. What gives?! Minus points. Stick with the regular dumplings, there's plenty of juice in there to give you the illusion of eating XLB. Service was fine, no complaints here, other than the head waiter being a tiny bit overbearing about what to order. Thankfully, they still have the pan fried taro cake for dessert. I don't care what y'all say about the creme brulee, order the taro cake. \n\nFinal nit-picky, but crucial point, the plastic covers on the menus are sticky and need to be changed.

I agree with other yelpers that in San Francisco you just don't find XLB that are as good as in NYC or Asia. The wrappers were thick, but the deal-breaker is the bland soup and meat. Old Shanghai's are far superior in terms of flavor, even though the wrappers there are a little thick as well.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, and the owner gave helpful suggestions. However, my overall impression is that it's not worth the 20 minute wait to get seated. For northern Chinese food (dumplings, chive and beef pancakes,cumin lamb), you'd do much better at Old Mandarin in Sunset. For XLB and other Shanghainese dishes go to Old Shanghai on Geary.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Norcal doesn't have good Chinese food.  I just think the taste preference is different.  I won't go into my whole theory about how the Chinese food is different between norcal and socal (and it has to do with new immigrants vs previous generation of immigrants) but here's what i think of this place and why it's just \"all right\".\n\nfood: 3.5 stars\n\n1. dumplings - 3 stars: \n-i'm giving it 4 stars for the selection of dumplings they offer.  there's literally like 30 different kind of dumplings on the menu which is really nice when you have a group that has different preferences on their meat choices.  we tried beef, pork, and lamb dumplings with different combinations of veggies such as chives, napa, and celery?\n-taste wise, just 2-3 stars for me.  the dough is good, handmade and just the right texture, but it's what i would expect from ANY dumpling place.  that's like saying a tortilla is good at a taqueria or the bun is good at panera bread.  the stuffing inside, however, is really bland and boring.    \n2. xiao lung bao - 3.5 stars:\n-again the dough is good, not as thin as ding tai fung's but has its own charm.  and the stuffing is actually more flavorful than the dumplings and has a lot of juice inside so be careful when you bite into it at first.\n3. others - mixed\n-we ordered a stir fry shanghai cabbage and it was actually really tasty.  it was fresh and with just the right amount of seasoning.\n-spicy beef tendon - completely tasteless \n-pot stickers - same as dumpling review\n\n8 of us spent $88 after tax/tip.\n\nservice: 2 stars\nsure, i expect bad service at a chinese restaurant so i wasn't complaining to the manager or leaving a bad tip at the end of the meal or anything.  but seriously they can't treat us like kids just because we're chinese and look young.  they're chinese!! they should know that just because we're wearing t-shirts and jeans doesn't mean we're teenagers!  not only did the server called the guys \"xiao di di\" (little boy) the entire time and talked to us like we're kids the whole time (we're 30 and older..), they try to tell us what to order, how many to order, and practically kicked us out of the restaurant because they wanted to us to finish asap.\ni understand that we had a big party (8) and took up pretty much half of the restaurant, but we are trying to have a meal just like everyone else there!  the server kept coming over to take our dishes away(and indirectly rushing us to finish the food on the dishes), and after throwin us the check on the table (w/o us asking for it), came back to look/touch/check the check and literally stood next to our table and stared us down until we paid and left.  \ntrust me, it's not like this was a nice spot to hang out and chat anyway!!  it is TINY and everytime the train passes by the whole ground shakes.  \n\nSince I'm not from the area, I have no idea where you could go to get better dumplings so this may be your only option.  The dumplings are no doubt authentic and fresh so that's why I would still give it 3 stars and you should try it especially if you have never had fresh dumplings.  However, if you eat fresh dumplings on a regular basis and you're used to flavorful stuffing, you will probably find this place just a little disappointing.", "author": "Cari H."}

This place is tiny AND crowded, get here early!\n\nService: It's alright, nothing too bad or amazingly good. The people were friendly, but it's a family business so everyone's running around juggling twenty tasks at a time.\n\nFood: The juicy part! the Xiao Long Bao are sort of overrated. But wait! The XLB is still pretty good, but I don't think it lives up to the over-inflated hype Yelpers have given it. Rather, I think the dumplings are overlooked: fantastic, and I mean fantastic dumplings. Good, tasty stuff. I'd recommend the dumplings, and the 'fried buns'.\n\nPrices: I would've liked cheaper, but the prices are really reasonable. 12 dumplings run $5-7 or something like that. XLB runs at 6 for something like $5. Don't quote me on those. It seems inexpensive here, but be ready to order two plates per if you're a voracious eater.\n\nOverall, 4 stars is where it's at.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-02", "description": "On one afternoon, craving for dim sum, I decided to step away from the usual and try something different.  Someone had told me that if I really like Yank Sing's Shanghai Dumplings - I must try Kingdom of Dumplings as their is comparable, so instead of spending another fortune at Yank Sing, I opted to travel out to the farthest end of San Francisco for some hopefully good Chinese food.  Rob, who likes to stick to what he knows, didn't want to go - and I basically had to coax, convince, beg, demand and insist that we go all the way out to the Sunset area to try this new place.\n \nThings you should know:\n \nTHIS PLACE IS SMALL.\nI don't mean compared to Yank Sing - I mean it's SMALL.  It has about 8 tables - and their kitchen is about the size of my bathroom.  You will have to go through the kitchen to get to their bathroom - and you WILL pass a bucketful of MSG and basically see how they cook everything.\n \nTHEY DO NOT SPEAK ANY ENGLISH.\nI don't mean they aren't fluent, I mean, seriously, they don't speak any English at all, and I speak no Chinese at all, so this made communication slightly difficult, but it was funny.  The woman who is the cook here is a lovely woman who was friendly and seemed very nice, but of course, she could have been insulting me w/ a smile and I would not know the difference.  There are plenty of other Asian restaurants around where nobody speaks English, including many Korean joints, so don't get me wrong - - shame on me for not knowing any Chinese is what I mean.\n \nWe ordered, I kid you not, a TON of food.\nPrice are quite economical here, and we figured we'd try it all!\n \nWe ordered one order each of a beef dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp dumpling.  We also ordered a salt and pepper tofu, beef pancake, and of course, had to try the Shanghai Dumplings.  I can honestly say that all the dumplings were good, but they all tasted basically the same, be it beef, pork, or shrimp.  That said, servings are generous.  We seemed to get at least 12 big dumplings for each order that cost about $7 each. Salt and pepper tofu was OUTSTANDING and plentiful for $4.99, served piping hot and crispy on the outside, soft as puffs of clouds on the inside, nicely seasoned.  The Shanghai Dumplings were good - - - but they can't hold a candle to Yank Sing's.  The beef pancakes were pretty mediocre - and we each took and bite and put it down -  it was basically all oil and turned out to be like a Chinese quesadilla type dish with some creamed beef in the middle or something.  (No offense if it's your thing - I'm just saying it wasn't my thing.)  \n \nWe also had a \"beef stew noodle soup w/ noodles\" - - except we had asked if it was a stew or soup.  They couldn't understand what we were asking, and looked stumped.  We explained we were looking for a soup w/ noodles - - nothing thick like a stew, but the language barrier was clear.  OK... so we just said yes, and pointed, and the man said, \"OK?\"  We said \"OK\" and the order was placed.  He held up one index finger, asking us if we wanted only one - and we nodded.  Then the woman came back out and pointed to the item on the menu to confirm, and said, \"Soup?\"  So we nodded.\n \nFive minutes later, out came the soup WITHOUT noodles....hahaha!  \nNow, all the other dishes, I really didn't feel like we were being doused w/ MSG.  For this soup, I could taste and smell it.  The chunks of beef in here, including tendons and such, were really not very good, and the soup had a stench or scent to it, much like the typical \"Beef Noodle Soup\" at a Chinese restaurant has.  I usually like that, but in this case, it was more of a stench than a scent - and we barely made a dent in it.  Those who know Rob knows he eats soup even if it's just hot water w/ salt - - and for him not to finish a soup down to the last drop was a first for me.\n \nEven with all of this food, the bill only came to $40 something.  Also notable was that at the time of 1:30 pm, this restaurant was getting progressively more crowded whereas it was emptier when we arrived.  They were predominantly Chinese people, so I'm inclined to think that this place actually does serve very authentic dishes.  \n\nLike I said, the dumplings were good - but with places like \"Taiwan Restaurant\" which I reviewed right before this, I don't see myself making it back out to this area for dumplings.\n \nWhile our meal here was decent, nothing really stood out.  Worth a try - sure.  Will I be a regular?  No.  \n\nAs a sidenote, due to the language barrier, this may be one of those places you just have to come with someone who is native to this language, and knows what to order.  It's plausible that we ordered wrong... but since I went for the dumplings and those were good, I'll stick to 3 stars, rounded up just because.\n \nSo, while it doesn't happen often (in my opinion, anyhow) - - he was right, I was wrong.  Should have gone to Yank Sing!", "author": "Grace K."}

Hot hot heaven. Also got the chicken chow mein with the most fresh tasting noodles I've had in a while. But with a hint of grease to make it just right and filling. And a delicious Thai tea to wash it down with.

This dumpling shop is very small with very limited seating and because all the seven tables were full, we waited outside in the rain momentarily before the owner pulled us in and sat me down at another customer's table which made an awkward situation for all of us. I opted to stand up in the doorway to wait for a table instead. Twenty minutes later, we were seated at a small cramped corner table by the window that was so drafty I kept my winter coat on all throughout dinner. We ordered their \"famous\" Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup dumplings) and chicken dumplings with napa cabbage, one of their many many types of dumplings offered. The owner was gregarious and pressured us to order an appetizer as well so we chose the beef tendon appetizer. The next thirty minutes of waiting for our food was painful since we were hungry and it's hard to watch other tables enjoy the dumplings. Finally, we were served the beef tendon appetizer which was cold (not mentioned on the menu), shredded and drowned with an over abundance of cilantro and lime juice. It was too salty and cilantro-y and we barely ate any of it. I definitely could have done without it, a dish I didn't want in the first place. Finally after another twenty minutes, the long awaited dumplings came and I anxiously dove in but was instantly disappointed. The dumplings were cold and the dumpling skins were very thick, bland, and unappealingly chewy. The cold dumplings with the cold appetizer and the overall cold atmosphere made a very unpleasant depressing meal. We ate half of the dumplings out of hunger and took the rest home to heat up properly for a second dinner. My experience here was quite lacking, but it must have been an off day for them and I could give their dumplings another try on a warmer day, but I'd prefer to go farther away for much better dumplings and service.", "author": "Rita N."}

She left our table without a word. Then through the kitchen window, I saw that they mixed up our orders with other tables. Then about 5 minutes, our lamb dumplings were here. I had my first bite, and it tasted different. So I looked inside the meat, IT IS RAW!!!! It is literally raw inside! OMG, so I asked the girl to come over and whispered to her that it is undercooked. She grabbed the dish and walked back into the kitchen. And through the kitchen window, I saw the chief said \"ma fan\" (which means in English, troublesome). About 5 minutes or so, she slide in the lamb dumpling dish and said \"it is cooked\". WOW...... this lady did not even apologize for what had  happened. She showed no emotion.

They were all quite good.  The xiao long bao had a very flavorful broth.  Both dumplings we ordered were pretty darn good and the dough was nice and soft.  The potstickers were only ok.  The meat was good but I thought they could have been pan fried a bit more.\n\nWe also ordered the sesame pancake w/ beef.  It was pretty good but it would have been better if the beef was warmed up.  I guess it's supposed to be served slightly cold with the sesame pancake warm.\n\nThe last thing on the menu we ordered was chicken & spinach dumpling in noodle soup.  The broth was flavorful without being too salty (as in full of MSG).  \n\nI'd definitely go back again but damn this place is small.

Over the next hour, it got crowded and the 2 wait staff (owner who took the orders and a young lady who cleared the plates, filled the tea and gave you the bill) couldn't really handle the full room in a timely manner.  The owner came in the door after we got our tea with a jelly roll tray of raw dumplings all lined up, they sure looked good. \nWe perused the menu and settled on 6 items:\npotstickers, chicken fried rice, beef chow fun, chicken and spinach dumplings, vegetarian egg rolls (they were out of the chicken ones) and a dumpling soup.  The owner suggested we try the dumplings pictured in a review hanging on the wall and the cilantro bean thread.  We declined both. \nIt took a long time for the orders to arrive, dish by dish, very slowly.  In other words, you're not getting outta here anytime soon if you're in a hurry.  The beef chow fun was the first to appear with pieces of beef, fun noodle, bean sprouts.  It was pretty good.  Then the potstickers arrived,  6 of them lined up on a plate.  They were slightly pan-fried with a thick skin and a juicy filling of meat.\nThe steamed chicken and spinach dumplings presented later with 12 small and juicy flavorful dumplings loaded with a large serving of chopped spinach and bits of chicken.  The fried rice was good with chucks of grlled chicken and mixed vegts. \nUnexpectedly, a steamer of Shanghai dumplings (xiao lung bao) materialized and was placed on our table.  We stared at it & remarked amongst ourselves that we didn't order it.  But, rather than make a scene, we decided to try it.  The owner either misunderstood with his limited English, accidentally or purposely ordered the Shanghai dumplings.  We'll give him the benefit of the doubt but he actually did us a favor as the Shanghai dumplings were delicious, rivaling the ones I've had at Yank Sing.  They were nicely twisted closed at the top with a good amt of broth inside and a nice chunk of meat filling.  I would venture back for this dish alone.  The vegt egg roll was the disappointment of the day.  Crispy skinned egg rolls with carrots and visible purple and green cabbage filling which was rather bland. \nThe 7th dish was the dumpling soup.  Probably my 2nd favorite dish of the day.  Crescent shaped dumplings manuvered into a circle shape with a mushroomy broth, mushrooms, 3 large chunks of Shanghai bok choy and ho fun noodle.  We ended up taking home some of the fried rice and chow fun because we couldn't finish.  The bill came to about $48 which was all written in Chinese characters.  If you can't read Chinese, you won't know if you were charged for the correct items.  We counted to make sure we were only billed for 7 items. \nSo, the food is good, skip the egg rolls, a sure winner is the steamed Shanghai dumplings but minus 1 for giving us an item we didn't order even 'tho it was very good.", "author": "Ry T."}

Shared between two people it was more than enough. Service was wonderful, especially considering it was a busy Friday night and only two people were working the front. We had about a 10 minute wait, and the owner brought us chairs which I thought was above and beyond what we needed (we would have been happy to stand!). The table service was friendly and efficient.

Ordered the following:\n\n* Very Good: Shanghai Soup Dumplings (not sure why they only offer 6 for $4.95...it would be better to offer 8 at $5.95 or $6.50). \n* Very Good: Beef Noodle Soup with the thin mami noodles (instead of wide rice noodles). Good broth and texture to noodles.\n* Good: Pork and Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup with wide rice noodles. Broth had a faint mushroom flavor...needed more umphhh...\n* Good: Pork and Chive Dumplings...pork has to be seasoned differently to ensure \"porky\" flavor stands out from other types of dumplings\n* Good: Fried Shanghai Soup Dumplings (only 4 pieces for $4.95...not sure why fewer for same price...again...should be 8 pieces maybe for $6.95 if cooking oil cost more than hot steaming water).\n* Uneven Service: Owner is nice and attentive. Serving staff is very reactive and requires customer direction for everything (i.e. my 6 yr old daughter was given chop sticks and tea. We asked for fork, spoon, and water).\n* Bad: The tea cups and tea had a soapy, bleachy odor to them...like they didn't rinse enough. \n* Bad: Walking through the busy and food strewn kitchen to get to the bathroom (modestly clean for a Asian Hole in Wall). \n\nOverall, a solid and tasty Hunan experience. Slightly better than Shanghai Dumpling King on Balboa. Would go back but in small group since seating is very limited.", "author": "H E."}

Now I haven't been one to go out of my way for XLB in the bay area, but I am pretty familiar with quality XLB's having had extensively eaten my way across China, Taiwan & Hongkong.  Also my asian mom has access to the asian mom mahjong networks and so we've been to some pretty poppin' chinese places. \nAnyway back to the food.  So we ordered an ordered:\nPork/Shrimp/Chive Dumplings- GOOD combo. Probably the tastiest thing of the meal\nPork/Cabbage Dumplings- A standard good eat\nShanghai Style Soup Dumplings (XLB)- Not bad. Could have had more soup. The skin was a little to easily broken :(\nOnion Pancake- Good. very tasty and crunchy. A little oily, but no complaints.\nGarlic-y Cucumber coldplate- They are mashed as opposed to cut.  Different but some pieces were too small and makes it difficult to pick up with chopsticks.\n\nOverall the dumplings here were not bad. I like the consistency of the dumpling skin, very Q ( english equivalent to chewy, al dente?) \nI would come here if I need a dumpling fix, but not necessarily for the XLBs.", "author": "gee t."}

I'm giving it 1 star not because of the dumplings, because those were good, but the 1 star is because of the HORRIBLE service!  The wait wasn't too bad, got a table that we had to share with 2 other people.  Thankfully the 2 other people were very nice so no big deal.  We ordered, food started coming out.  The 5 spice beef was gross.  The special cucumber salad was good and the fried tofu was OK. \n\nHere's the service issue that occurred, about 15 minutes after our first dish came out we decided we wanted to try the pot stickers too so we flagged down someone to add another dish.  Wait, let me back up... I asked for hot water when we sat down, never got it.  Asked again, still never got it. Back to the pot stickers, a few minutes later the waitress comes back and tells us it'll be 15 mins for the pot stickers and we respond with Okay.  She then clarifies, 50 minutes like an hour. Uh, what?  I misunderstood and thought pot stickers took longer so I said, \"Okay, can we get the pork and cabbage dumplings instead?\" Same answer, 50 minutes.  We weren't in a hurry and we haven't gotten all our dishes yet so we said okay.  Then the girl tells us, \"No.\" No?  \"No.\"  No, we could not order anything else. Wow.  We ended up finishing the rest of our food then chatted with our table mates for about another 30 mins, they were shocked at the way we were treated. While we were talking their last dish came about 15 minutes after they were done eating. Since they had to go, he asked the waitress can they just box it up to go. Her response was to shove the plate back at him and said \"You take it and put it in a box yourself.\"  Awesome treatment. They shared with us that it wasn't like that before, ever since they've gotten busier their service has been terrible. Guess they don't need to treat their customers nice anymore. We all decided that will be the last time we ever eat there especially since there are other dumpling places! \n\nFinal note: dumplings are good but the abuse is not worth it.

It took us about 30-45 min to get a table.  We decided to order just dumplings since this place is supposedly known for it.  We were craving the Xiao Long Bao so we ordered the pan fried and steamed versions.  We also ordered the potstickers and the shrimp and chive dumplings.  The XLBs were the biggest disappointment....the skins on both versions did not hold up the soup at all or maybe these dumplings were just overcooked.  The pan fried versions were practically dry inside.  Luckily I enjoy adding the soy vinegar ginger dipping sauce into my dumplings, so that helped.  The steamed XLBs were practically shriveled up so there was no soup left inside either.  Some of the skins also punctured easily upon handling with the chopsticks.  We thought the shrimp and chive dumplings would save our meal, but they accidentally added 3 lamb dumplings into the plate.  I had the unfortunate surprise of eating two of them and was disgusted, as I hate the taste of lamb.  We didn't make any complaints because it would have been too difficult to explain to the waitress when all the dumplings look alike.  The saving grace was actually the pot stickers.  They were well breaded and pan fried and actually had more juice/soup in them than the XLBs.

It's seriously a hole in the wall shop..i think they turned a house into a restaurant.  Luckily, my family and i didn't have to wait at all..we were immediately seated since we went at 3pm on a weekday.  We ordered the chicken and corn dumplings, xiao long bao, onion pancakes, pork and green bean dumplings, chow mein, and sesame pancake with marinated beef.  All the dumplings were scrumptious and cooked to perfection.  The dough wasn't too hard, nor the meat too dry!  I also LOVED their sesame pancake with marinated beef...i think this would be my fav.  The prices were a bit steep, but i guess all dim sum prices are like that.  Our family spent about $40 for our meal.

I wish I had followed their lead.   \n\nThe waiter silently thew some menus on the table, but, curiously, not one listing any dumplings.  We were close enough to the kitchen to reach over for the missing sheet, but the waiter was deliberately avoiding speeking with us, so we wondered if this was his way of indicating that dumplings were not available at off times for some reason.  So we ordered a soup and a stir fry on the reasoning that these are usually made fresh from prepped ingredients.  \n\nAs others have said, very very slow, very poor service.  The waiter never spoke to us, the table next to the large party was stacked with dirty dishes which stayed there for our entire visit.  The food was also awful, salty soup and greasy noodles.  We ate what we could, and left the rest.   When the waiter finally deigned to deliver the check, he noticed the mostly full plates and recommended we have dumplings next time!  Maybe we would have!

Dumpy place with what appears to be a husband and wife team that really makes Northern Chinese dumplings.  It's home cooking Chinese style, and yes, this is the real stuff.  The dumplings were a little heavier in the dough and meat than the Manchurian dumplings I eat at least once a month in China - but certainly within the authentic bell curve.  Get a cucumber salad appetizer, some pork and chive dumplings, some cold beer, and how can you go wrong?  \n\nI also tasted their pork dumplings with \"sour chinese vegetable\" (the Chinese invented sauerkraut - that's what I read, anyway).  It's missing the tang of the version i often eat in China, but I'm not complaining.  Their specials on the board looked westernized, but the printed menu has a small sampling of what appears to be real Chinese food.   (Missing a variety vegetables though)\n\nGreat place to take Americans to expose them to something real from China.   Just don't bring anyone who needs a polished hygienic atmosphere.\n\nNote:  They serve the vinegar and soy in separate dipping bowls.  Add a little bit of the vinegar to the soy bowl and dip your dumplings in that one.  That's the way it tastes in China.", "author": "David Z."}

They come out steaming hot, six to an order.  Watch out when you bite into the first dumpling, don't burn your mouth!  Also, don't forget to use your big Chinese soup spoon to hold the dumpling before biting into it because the dumplings really do hold soup!  The boiled dumplings (sui jiao) are also wonderful - I have tried two types of the eight or so they offer - the vegetarian and lamb with Chinese vegetable.  Each order has 12 of these delectable morsels, featuring a handrolled flour wrapper surrounding a plump pocket of perfectly seasoned ground meat (or tofu for the veggie version) laced with finely chopped Chinese vegetables (e.g. napa cabbage, Chinese celery, or spinach).  The dumplings are cooked in boiling water and then served to your table piping hot.  The last menu item I really loved was the lo bo si bing (shredded turnip cakes).  Each order features two perfectly baked golden brown sesame seed topped balls, filled with a delectable mixture of shredded daikon and ground pork.  At $2.95 an order, it's not bad for a little piece of culinary heaven.\n\nOh, and the appetizers are pretty tasty too.  The tofu thread salad with cilantro is marinated in a delicate rice vinegar and sesame oil dressing.  I look forward to trying the other menu items.  The clientele is mostly native mainland Chinese speakers and other folks who are in the know.

My friend from Taiwan tells me that it sounds even cooler in Chinese!\n\nAnd I think it lives up to that...it is a Kingdom of Dumplings, but not much else.\n\nThe Shanghai Soup Dumplings are definitely the best I've had in SF.  Much better than Shanghai Dumpling King (Balboa and 34th).     The Pork Dumplings with Green Chives were pretty good.   Both of these are also available frozen (as are all their other dumplings).  I took roughly $25 worth of frozen dumplings home with me.\n\nThe Vegetarian Dumplings were just okay.   I'm used to the kind with more mushroom, more glass noodle, maybe some more bamboo?   These were well-seasoned, but mostly full of napa cabbage, with a touch here of ginger and egg.   \n\nThe Sesame Pancake with Meat (or Beef?)  was pretty good.   I'm used to the five-spice beef, hoisin sauce and fresh green onion all rolled up in a Green Onion Pancake.   This version was not as decadant, but okay.  My friend from Taiwan was liked the pancake better than the filling.\n\nWe also ordered the Beef Noodle Soup...which is really not what you think of when you think Chinese Beef Noodle Soup.   If you taste the broth---a hint of the aniseed, beef is there...but this is NOT Beef Noodle Soup.   I think it would have been better if they added a bit more anise stars, and some tomato, perhaps a carrot or some daikon.     They should rename it.  It's more like Noodle Soup with beef.    \n\nWe also ordered Salty Soybean Milk---which is my all-time favorite thing to eat!   Since it's so rarely on a menu, I always order it.   This is my fourth time ordering it in SF, and 3 out of 4 times---it was really horrible.   (The one okay time was at Taste of Formosa.  Just okay.)    This time also was really, particularly bad.   There were no floating pieces of oil donuts, no preserved radish, no chili oil and no vinegar.   (I know it sounds bad, but if you ever try a good version of this, it is truly heavenly.  Unfortunately, I'm convinced you have to go to New York or Taiwan to have it.)\n\nIn all---i would totally go back, and buy and eat dumplings.  Yeah, the decor, the low ceiling, the odd-ly packed in tables, the lone waiter talking the entire time to his friend on his cell phone...but it is a hole-in-the-wall after all.  A true dumpling find.   Just not much else.", "author": "G H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-16", "description": "I ate there on 12/29/08 and the first thing that struck me was - THIS IS SUCH A SMALL SPACE!  I mean, really, the seating is very small and tight.  The table/seat that is right by the door to the establishment may end up bumping the person who is sitting there because of the small dimensions of the dining room.\n\nAlso, the place is very non-descript.  Nothing fancy, just the room, tables, chairs, and the menus.  Is that necessarily bad?  No, as long as one doesn't have unreasonable expectations.  It seems that I tend to eat at a lot of hole-in-the-wall establishments.  So, here goes another review of just such a place.\n\nI set aside my impression of the interior and focused on the food on the menu.\n\nThey offered some uncommon dishes, so we ordered the chicken and spinach wonton with wide rice noodes, the lamb dumplings with Chinese vegetables, the green chives pancake, and the sesame pancake with marinated beef.\n\nThe sesame pancake with marinated beef was very good and the dough that they used to make it was nice and crispy.  Think of it as being something like a stuffed pizza (but not so big) and like an empanada (again, not so big).  The flavor was great.\n\nThe lamb dumplings were okay, too.  It wasn't what I expected, but I was willing to try it since I'd never had lamb dumplings before.  Many dumplings are usually made of pork chicken meat.  The chicken and spinach wonton with noodles were good, too.  I guess if I were to describe it, the term comfort food comes to mind.\n\nOverall, the food was good.  I didn't have any problems with what they offered, how it was made, and how it tasted.  It was good.  Plain and simple.  For our party of four (my wife, son, my mother and I), the bill was very affordable!  It came to just around $30 with the tip.\n\nSince the kitchen was very close by, one could see that the food was being freshly prepared.  But, the other thing that could be seen was how cramped it was in there, too.\n\nWhen I had to go use the restroom, I had to go through the kitchen area and it was almost like doing the do-si-do because you had to dance around the cook and be careful about the traffic flow through the kitchen and the stove.\n\nDrawbacks?  Well, the person who took our order did not speak very much English, which did make communicating difficult for other customers who spoke no Mandarin at all.  My wife and I helped another patron who clearly was having a difficult time trying to make their needs known to the server.\n\nAnother problem:  even after the other tables were empty, the staff took a long time to clear the tables of the dishes.  That meant that they got stacked up and didn't go anywhere for quite a while.  So, that was a mild turn-off.  If they were to get really busy on any given day, what would happen then?  That made me wonder.\n\nBut, again, the food was good, the prices very reasonable, and the staff were pleasant.  Still, they really need to do something about the seating arrangements and to take care of things in the main dining area a little faster.  It's not a good impression to a prospective customer when they see a lot of dishes sitting at empty tables that are waiting to be cleared.\n\nTheir take out menu had a URL listed, but I checked it and it didn't pull up their website at all.  I have no idea what happened and when, but you won't find anything about them unless you come here to Yelp or to check out the other links that may come up in your search engine (like restaurant reviews in other local newspapers).\n\nIf they can help themselves get past these humps, people will find that this is a good place to eat.  I wouldn't count this place out, but I am not really going to be rushing back here, either.\n\nStreet parking is all that is available, with much of it being metered along Taraval Street.  There may be some residential parking available, but that is still a hit-or-miss proposition.  This is San Francisco, after all.\n\nI would not recommend large groups of people coming here because seating isn't exactly spacious.", "author": "E L."}

This repeat patron is NEVER going back to Kingdom of Dumpling!! \n\nTo make a long and extremely unpleasant story short, it took 40 minutes to get one item in our order, a cold bean noodle; 50 minutes to get our dumplings; and approximately 65 minutes to get the last, but by then, unwanted item, a chive pancake.\n\nService has always been slow here.  The disorganized wait staff never remembers the order in which they seat their diners and takes food orders out of sequence.  Your party may be the second table seated, but they often take the order of a later seated table before yours.  Okay, I get that this is a small business with a limited staff, but the dining room is so small and cramped (about 10 small tables) that I can't understand how two waiters could miss a diner with raised hand waving for service!\n\nFresh dumplings can take from 20-30 minutes to cook.  I expect to wait that long for my dumpling order to be ready.  What I don't expect is to wait 30 minutes only to have the waitress come back to my table with a menu in hand announcing the kitchen has run out of the kind of dumplings my husband and I had ordered 30 minutes ago.  Could we order another kind of dumpling.  Why didn't she tell us that when we first placed the order!?  And what about the other two items in our order that do not require such a long cooking time?  My husband and I had now been sitting in this restaurant for over 40 minutes with nothing in front of us but a pot of very weak tea watching other tables that had been seated about the same time as we had been, and even after us, consume their food and leave.\n\nDuring the interminable wait, my husband kept inquiring of the waitress as to the status of our food order and she kept replying that the kitchen was cooking it.  She lied!  Finally, in total frustration, we decided not to wait any longer.  We voiced out complaints to the proprietor, expressed our desire to not wait for the final item, and requested the tab for the two dishes we actually got.  The owner, however, with no apology for the incompetency of his wait and kitchen staff and our extremely long wait, insisted that since the pancake was (finally) being cooked as we were registering our complaints and requesting the bill, he wants us to pay for it!  My husband was so irate at this point by the horrendous service and the avaricious attitude of the owner that he didn't care that the whole restaurant heard him arguing with the owner!  Eventually, our hunger drove us to end the impasse so we could go somewhere else to appease our growling stomachs.  \n\nIt is obvious this restaurant owner does not value his repeat customers if he is willing to risk future business and a bad Yelp review for a mere $5.95 worth of chive pancake.", "author": "Lillian C."}

We had a party of 6 and although we had to wait a bit, it was well worth it.  We actually went here 3 times in a span of 5 days---it was close to San Francisco State University  (where my daughter just moved into her dorm).  The pork & corn dumplings were delicious as well as the garlic string beans, beef pancakes and the many other dishes we tried.  The owner was extremely nice to us even though we had a large party.

XLB's had a good amount of broth, but the meat was pretty bland.  The skin was nice and thin but, the tops were thick and hard.  Their green onion pancakes weren't cooked long enough and could've been more crispy.  The pig ear appetizer was excellent especially with a nice cold beer, just wish we asked for extra green onions.  We also ordered a couple of other dumplings that weren't worth getting a second time around.", "author": "Eric T."}

Here are some tips:  call ahead for reservations; they have dumplings, green onion pancakes and pot stickers (raw) for sale (here and at their Noriega store) and get a party of 6 people (so that you are not stuck by the door getting your chair banged by the front door)!  Service consisted about two people to serve you, not kid friendly, and server actually told us not to order the pan fried dumplings since we had pot stickers already as it would take too long to make. He actually said no!  Then when we asked at end if they take credit cards, he said yes, but changed his mind and said no!!!  Then we saw person behind us paying with a card. That other yelper was right. Beware!  All in all, I would have preferred to get the raw and cook by myself. Cucumber salad and XO chicken chow mein was good. Green onion pancake and pot stickers were really good. Not so into the boiled dumplings.  The little shanghai dumplings were good, but I've had better. All in all, won't go there again unless desparate for food. Rather hat to go.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

The spicy five flavor marinated beef was alright . The salty soy milk and sweet soy milk failed to impress me . The salty soy milk was not salty enough and the sweet soy milk was not sweet enough . What really impressed me was their XO beef chow fun .. it was really yummy ! I also love their hot sauce that sits on the table !! I was kind of hesitant to try it first because of the color ( it's orange ) but I'm glad I tried it . It's unlike any other hot sauce I've ever tried . It tastes like a mix of chinese mustard and chili sauce ( in the best way possible ) . It's very flavorful and pretty spicy ! I love this place !! I was thinking of thinking this place 4 stars but because of their XLB , XO beef chow fun , hot sauce , and interesting menu , I'm giving it 5 stars instead . Also because the food here is pretty good when it comes to San Francisco Shanghai food standards . There's so many things on the menu I haven't tried yet ! They all seem so delicious so I'll definitely be back V^______^V !! Btw , be sure to get here early because the restaurant is small and it gets filled up easily so you might have to wait .", "author": "Eileen L."}

Maybe we need to travel to the San Tung Province in order to determine if San Tung Restaurant in SF in fact does have the best dumplings in the world!  \n\nSorry...  a bit off track here...

The selection of dumplings is good, with a variety of meat, veggies and shrimp combinations.  You can get the boiled or pan fried, and both combinations are good.  I keep meaning to go back and ask for frozen dumplings for me to take home.\n\nThe dumplings here are just awesome.  You take a bite, and the soup comes squirting out - the way they should.  I personally like pork & chives or shrimp & chives, but all of the dumplings I've had here are good.  Their other food is also good, like the onion pancakes, wonton soup, and they've got really good vegetable dishes too.  If you've managed to save room for dessert, ask for the vanilla bean flan - the waiter takes a propane torch and browns it for you.  A great end to any meal!\n\nBest thing - this place is hella cheap.  What a great value.

Apparently when we arrived the waitress had not arrived, so the cook took our order, problem was that none of us spoke Chinese and no one that was working spoke English.  We got our order by pointing and gestures.  We ordered 2 orders of Shanghai Soup Dumplings, 2 orders of Shrimp Dumplings, and the Beef Pancake.  One of the ladies came out and tried to explain to us something, and we were not sure what was going on. The Shrimp Dumplings came out, and they were pretty bland.  Then the beef pancakes came out, it was greasy, but good.  We waited and were wondering what happened to the Soup Dumplings.  Finally the English speaking waitress arrived and told us that were out of the Shanghai Soup Dumplings.  We were all very disappointed, so we looked at the menu trying to figure out a substitution.  Then the waitress came out and said they had some, so we were all happy. They came out and it was the first time for all of us and the dumplings did not disappoint.  They were very yummy.  We had 2 orders which came out to 10 dumplings.  After we polished them off we wanted another order, but we were told that they were too busy for us to order more.  What?!? So that sucked.  So, I liked the Soup Dumplings were worth coming here for, but I don't think it is worth warranting a repeat.", "author": "Peter W."}

I ordered lamb dumplings which were fairly good. However, I don't know whether it was the dumplings or the chilli sauce that I had with it, but I got a tummy upset which lasted a couple of days! I'm BIG on hot & spicy food, so if I get a stomach issue, it's usually because of unhygenic food. In terms of ambience, it was a bit shabby and the whole place smelled wierd - like it's not been cleaned in ages. Ok it's a hole-in-the-wall, but I've seen some such places make it big by getting the food, service and hygene right. I'm surprised to see so many good ratings for this restaurant. There obviously was something others were able to see (or eat) that I wasn't.\n\nThe service was quite unimpressive. The whole family (which happens to be the staff) ate lunch at a nearby table and didn't pay enough attention to the customers that walked in. Hey, I understand everyone needs a break to eat lunch, but do it without compromising customer service - perhaps close for and hour in between, or take turns eating or something! As I got ready to check out, I was presented with an UNITEMIZED check with some gibberish written in Chinese. WTF? Is that supposed to give a more \"authentic\" Chinese touch to it? As if that wasn't annoying enough, as I got ready to pay with my credit card, the waiter said that he \"preferred cash\". Ok, my bad, I didn't carry enough cash - I insisted on paying by card, but the buggar came back saying his CC machine had run out of printing paper. By the time I was done paying by borrowing cash from my girlfriend, I'd made up my mind that this was my first & last visit to this place.", "author": "Dan C."}

(not to mention when some other Asians came in later they had a bowl of rice) Very clean friendly place with a huge variety of people, I enjoyed myself immensely. The funniest part to me was I had asked if they had a restroom and the waiter and the manager (I'm guessing) said yes very enthusiastically but never said where it was haha. So when I asked the manager, after him saying yes I asked where was it? He said let me show you! so he guided me to the back of the kitchen where alas there was the bathroom (forgive my long story on the bathroom, it was just amusing and to me it's part of my experience, I'm strange like that) bathroom was ok, not the cleanest and not well stocked but it served it's purpose.

The windows were frosty and had some kind of.. crust.. on them.  The sign was scratched up.  No one was in there.  My dad had to drag me into the restaurant, and why insisted to go inside was beyond me.  \nHowever, as I stepped inside the restaurant and took a more careful look, it wasn't half as bad.  There were about 7 tables total and the utensils looked clean.  The walls were old but were painted a happy milky yellow.  Not bad.  \nWe ordered the Shanghai dumplings, onion pancake, salty soybean milk, and some sort of noodle that wasn't good enough for me to remember.  The Shanghai dumplings were DELICIOUS (**TIP**: judge your dumplings by how much soup is in there when you bite in and how moist the meat is); they were practically puffed up with dumpling-juice.\nThe onion pancake was so damn crispy and addictive.  There wasn't much onion in there, though.  \nThe soybean milk didn't have enough goodies in it, but it was good nonetheless \n**TIP**: real good salty soybean milk is loaded with goodies such as seaweed, dried shrimp, and dried pork meat (yook sung)).  \n\nThe two people who served us (the owners, I assume) didn't know English at all, so it was hilarious when two American people came in and tried to ask for something that wasn't on the menu.  \n\nAnd I was surprised to know that they have a location on Noriega where they sell more than 30 different kinds of potstickers/dumplings so you can purchase them and cook it yourself.", "author": "Connie P."}
