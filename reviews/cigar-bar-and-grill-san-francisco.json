But this past Saturday was a different story and I have only one person to blame. The incredibly rude and slowest bartender I have ever seen. He was wearing a brimmed hat and had tattoos on his hand and I think one of those douche I think I'm a cool guy moustaches.\nQuick details- it was a busy night but we were helped to a cigar right away when we walked up, as for the bartender we honestly waited almost 20 minutes while he made 1 drink at a time and kept passing me and my group of about 3 guys and 2 girls. Even my gf tried reaching out to him and telling him we have been waiting but he completely ignored us. It was until the manager who looked like she was on top of everything came and saw that we were upset and waiting and spoke to my gf about our insanely long wait, that we got served.\nShe comped us some drinks for the wait and that's really the only reason I didnt leave 1 star ( I'm leaving 2 stars for now because I'm still pretty disgusted on how the bartender acted, I might change it to 3 stars later when I feel better about the situation)  and wanted to shout out to the manager in this post and say you rock, you were on top of things and handled the situation in a very professional manner and I applaud that. As for that bartender I dont know what stick he had up his behind or if he is normally just rude, slow and full of himself but he needs to recognize he is in customer service and works front of the house ! He didnt even say I'm sorry I am busy but I will be with you shortly. Just a big fat ignore ! \nTake your dumb hat off while your working and act professional if not dont be a bartender, and next time how about you dont make 1 drink at a time when someone orders 3 of the same drink!", "author": "Angelo G."}

We were too late and the kitchen was already closed.  I have been here in the past and I know the food is pretty good.\nThe smoking section - OMG! I used to be a smoker and man, the smell of both cigar and cigarettes were just too much for me. However, for that one night, it was tolerable but we had to leave.  We ended up going to the dance floor.\nThe dance floor - LOVE, LOVE the music and the energy. The dance floor is a bit small.  Be flexible! I had a woman whipping her long hair left and right and hit me many times.. but it's all good... Toes may get stepped on but just be patient and enjoy yourself.

I've been itching to go dancing and my boyfriend showed this to me so we decided to give it a try. Let me tell you how happy my Cuban/Dominican self was! This place is cool. They have the main bar area, outside seating and then the dance floor area. The dance floor is kind of small which can make it difficult to dance (especially when people are trying to do all these damn fancy salsa spins) so you just have to be careful. It's amazing because it's a live band playing music which made me feel like I was a kid again growing up in Miami. All I could keep telling my boyfriend was how when my mom decides to visit me I'm bringing her tiny little Cuban self here to get her dance on. I also have a brother who is a HUGE cigar aficionado and I'm going to use Cigar Bar as another way to convince him and my sister-in-law to fly out to come visit me. The scene was very diverse from very beginners to intermediated dancers and even just plain ol people like me who grew up dancing it at home and not learned in classes. No one is shy to ask each other to dance and it was not 'stuffy' in there (meaning no one seemed to have a stick up their ass). I only am giving 4 stars for now because I didn't try any food or any of the cigars. Definitely going to come back on another Saturday for salsa but show up earlier to have dinner, drinks and a cigar before the dancing begins.", "author": "Yochabel U."}

Having read much of \"bars\" in my human arts and culture courses as an undergradling, I was excited for my first experience with this seeming bedrock of civilization.\n\nUpon entering the human drinking chamber, or \"bar\" as it is known colloquially due to the well known and understood limitations on the species' vocabulary variance, I was greeted with cheer by what I believe to be the chamber's Chief Alchemist. She introduced herself to us as Mariah, and according to my studious observation she appears to be the chaperon of the state altering spirit journey the human patrons pay her to guide. Our chemical cocktail did not have a name, but it was supposedly reminiscent of a fruit known on Earth as a \"pineapple,\" and allegedly her own witchcraft. According to my research, this varies from most human drinking chambers where patrons are confined to the potions listed on what is known as a \"menu.\" Mariah's alchemy appears to be superior in this regard.\n\nWe thank Mariah for her assistance with our studies, as this preliminary ethnographic research will surely provide inspiration for future work in the field. Upon my return to my home planet, I will be requesting a grant for additional research conducted at The Cigar Bar and Grill on a behavior that appears to occur regularly in its back room: human courting rituals. Or as it is known on Earth, \"dancing.\"\n\n- Klorp", "author": "Tamar K."}

I've only tried a cigar once before so the whole thing is new to me. \n\nNot really a fan of it. I generally don't enjoy smoke at all so this wasn't an exception. However, this place had a cool, hip, laid back ambiance that was unique.\n\nThey also served food there. I was a little tipsy so decided to try out their mushroom pasta dish to sober up a bit and it sounded delicious. Took a long time for just for me to get my order in and the food took even longer to come out. \n\nThe entire staff seemed disorganized and not as efficient as they should be. I had to flag down a waitress when I wanted to order, if my food was still coming, and when I was ready to pay the bill. That's a lot of work just for a plate of pasta. \n\nWhen the food finally came out, it looked great! Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as it looked. Noodles were undercooked and it lacked sauce which I thought tasted pretty good. The part that annoyed me though was the lump of green that was placed in the middle of the pasta that would not separate. I literally had to eat it as a chunk - weird. \n\nOverall, if you're into cigars and enjoy a nice place to have drunk conversations then this place is the spot for you. They even have salsa dancing and the live band is awesome. \n\nWould I be back? Yes, but I'll just enjoy a drink next time and hold out on the food.", "author": "Michael T."}

Once past the admission door ($10 after 10p) you decent into a dim bar den and beyond is a open-air courtyard filled with eager cigar aficionados (or that's at least what they looked like to me) eagerly puffing away. In an adjacent room, and 6- or 8- piece Latin band is jamming away busting out modern and classic takes on salsa, rumba, cha cha cha, etc. The medium-sized dance floor is usually full, but there always seems to be room for one more couple The best thing to do, really, is to dance. Take a few lessons or fake it-- no one will really notice-- but get out there and shake that booty. You won't regret it. As for the cocktails, they are fairly prices at around $10, and not too sweet. My suggestion: substitute mezcal into the Tequila Tears drink and just stick to that all night. Yum. Looking forward to my next return.

We did everything through email. I always have a million and one questions, and he answered them ALL (not like others who skip right over questions...super annoying!). \n\nSecond, I want to commend our server, Sean. He was fantastic and took such good care of my group the entire night. Thanks Sean - you were awesome and The Cigar Bar is lucky to have you. \n\nOk, on to the details of the night...\nFood: I planned for 12 of my friends to dine. I didn't want to deal with the whole splitting of checks or figuring out who ate what, so I love that they require family style ordering for groups of 10 or more. Perfect. I chose the following from the event menu: \nSalad; Bread; Chicken; Steak (chimichurri); Fish; Penne Pesto Pasta; and Asparagus. The proteins were served as 8 half portions (you have the option of serving them as 4 full - but I recommend the halves since people usually like to try everything). It was all DELICIOUS! Most of us are foodies, and we loved everything we tried. My mostly vegetarian friend even tried the meats b/c she was so curious and loved them!\n\nAmbiance: We arrived at 6:30 on Saturday night, and it was fairly empty with the exception of a few folks at the bar. We were seated in the dining room next to the bar. It was great because we were alone for a while. It started to fill up closer to 8pm. I loved the atmosphere here! It's just...so cool! Yes, you can smell cigar smoke the whole night (even though smoking is only allowed in the patio). But I didn't mind it at all and neither did anyone in my group. The people were so chill here, even on the dance floor. So it didn't feel at all like the creepy vibe I usually get from some people at other clubs (back when I'd go clubbing). \n\nService: Like I said above, Sean was awesome. He kept checking on us and he would ask me when I wanted to start serving. We brought 3 bottles of wine ($18 corkage fee for each - a bit high but that's the city and worth it to bring what you like) and he was attentive to keeping our glasses filled, as well as other drinks. I also brought a cake, which he promptly put in the fridge for me. He then served it for us and even added the candles (which was awesome and not expected!). If I have to have any con for the night, it's that I wish the table would have been cleared off. It was piled with plates and glasses the whole time, so I kept trying to stack things to make space for us all to just talk and chill.  \n\nSalsa dancing: I can't recall the instructor's name, but he was great! Our classes were included since we dined there, but I believe they are usually $15. This was a fun thing to do with our group, since most of us love to dance. Classes start around 8:45pm or so and go through 9:40pm. They then open the dance floor to all. It does get pretty full, but I'd rather a full floor than an empty one (b/c honestly, who wants to dance then?). \n\nThanks to everyone at the Cigar Bar who made this night special for my sister. She was so happy and thoroughly enjoyed her night. All my friends have been talking about the great time they had too!", "author": "Karen G."}

Bathrooms were fairly small considering how packed this place was, but its not a problem for us guys. The bar was packed, and the bartenders were scrambling from taking and processing orders to helping people get cigars out of their humidor. That whole process led to a lot of confusion, but eventually figured it out. Great selections of scotch, whiskeys, and tequilas... didn't pay attention to anything else.\n\nWe found a small area to post against and get our grown man on, and continually dodging and moving to let people walk past.

The ambiance is quite cool and we sat outside by a lovely fountain, which was great until the crazy SF wind made an uninvited appearance. Everyone around us was smoking, mostly cigars, as the name of the bar anticipated, but I was not bothered at all (I used to be a smoker so I kind of dug the atmosphere).\n\nI had one of their draft beers and that was quite ok. My friends had ordered the cheese plate and also the nacho portion (this last one is sooooo big that the waitress actually told us she has never seen anyone finish it before, which makes me think it's just plain silly to serve so much food knowing it's gonna go to waste)! But hey, I guess lots of people dig oversized food portions so I just have to deal with my distaste for it.\n\nI ended up ordering a pasta dish, since there were not that many options. It came with pesto and some peppers, and although it was not bad, it was pretty boring, lacked sauce and was a bit overcooked. Nevertheless, I was happy to eat it. Prices were not too friendly, but that was to be expected. As we left we had quite a fun chat with the guy who works at the door, and he was very nice and helpful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-18", "description": "So on Saturday October 18th I attended a private party for a special young lady and as everyone finally started to gather around the table I decided that a bottle of bubbly for the first toast was in order. So I asked the two staff members to assist me with that and they provided all of the champagne flutes and a bucket with the bubbly! I specifically asked that no one in the group be billed for this small gesture! After everyone was done with the toast I asked our server to bring me the bill. They came back with a bill and a credit card and something did strike me funny about the credit card and looking back because the only thing I had was a sip of sparkling wine that what was different was that there was no gold lettering on the credit card and yet I still immediately in order to pay the bill put the credit card back in my wallet and even though something was telling me something was amiss I focused on the festivities! At some point a patron complained that she had not received her credit card and demanded they locate it. It was in my wallet and they finally figured out that I was the one that had the credit card, the problem with that is they did not bring me back my credit card! So from an hour and a half to close to two hours I had no idea and neither did they where my credit card was! Even after I finally demanded that I get my credit card immediately it was still another 20 minutes before they finally returned my credit card! So for close to two hours I had no idea how many hands my credit card had passed through! What I am absolutely sure of is that this business overextended themselves and in order to reach a greater profit they booked all the private parties they could but did not bother to staff up! As a result of that the staff was obligated to take up the slack and our server Katy was amazing but you could  see that she was running flat-out and somebody decided they were going to jump in and complete transactions not knowing who the patrons were and who's credit cards went where! So I received someone else's bill and also someone else's credit card! I have had the luxury of dining out 7 days a week for the last 25 years I go into just about every four and five star restaurant in the city and I have both large and small parties! I have never experienced this lack of professionalism! This was sheer and absolute carelessness on the part of management! The server who attended to our every need every moment she had a chance (her name is Katie) came over and apologized profusely even though I know she was not the one that lost the credit card! So this episode took place on Saturday night and on Sunday afternoon I left a message for Matt to call me I was respectful and courteous Matt is the general manager I did not receive a call back! I called again on Monday again I did not receive a call back! At that point I decided that I needed to call my bank because I did not know if my card had been breached and compromised! Security was definitely lax at this place of business! So in looking at my bank account online this morning I noticed that I was charged twice! There are two separate charges! I feel terrible for the young server because Everywhere I Go Everywhere I conduct personal or business-related Gatherings everyone knows that I usually leave a 50% tip regardless of the amount! The waterbar can certainly attest to that! I did similar on the first bill and when I received the second bill I did sign it but I left no tip! My plan was to talk to Matt the general manager at which point I assumed I would get some minor apology for the inconvenience because after they did that I was no longer in a festive mood! It took me an hour and a half to stop worrying that my credit card was being used somewhere! I had hoped that after speaking with the general manager that I could drop an envelope for Katie thanking her for working so very hard! I lament the fact that she lost a nice tip because of the incompetence of the team! I've attended a number of political events there because it is the place chosen by the number one political consulting firm in the city 50 plus one. My Hope Is Never to have to go back there again given that there are so many top notch businesses that serve any type of libation and food fit for Foodies! I unfortunately had to cancel my credit card with my bank and I now have the inconvenience of not having the ability to use that credit card until the new one arrives!

I would have given this place 4 stars but the pours on the Scotch were weak.  The MaCallan 18 was way overpriced, especially for the pour (not even a 2 finger pour).  The Balvenie 17 and Obahn was a little better on price, but again a weak pour.  Regarding the Scotch it worked out to about $8-$12 a sip.\n\nI will probably go back, but will do mixed drinks.

I came with a trio of girls, one being Cuban born and raised in Miami and consequently a die hard Salsa lover and she said this place had to be one of her favorite experiences for Salsa dancing. The gentlemen were quite gentelmen-like about dancing -- except for one crazy drunk salsa man. But he was easy to avoid amongst the many other people to dance with. We also ordered drinks at the bar -- very reasonable around $7 a drink. If you don't feel like dancing, there is the freedom to watch from the sides or the back, there are benches that line one wall which is enough because everyone ends up dancing at least once! I brought a friend who had NO prior salsa experience and still had a blast.

Good lord, we really didn't even think it was ever coming, it took so long.  Well, luckily the flat bread was amazing. Of course you guessed it, the bill also took lord knows how long.

What's nice about the setting is that there's a giant patio, a bar, and some tables in the dining room area.

But, how funny that the pour was the same size as a regular Bulleit, neat.

Had a company function/birthday party here, and I can see the appeal, but you'll end the night smelling like smoke, which, I mean, is par for the course. They have a really solid selection of beers (on tap and in cans/bottles) and liquor, so you can't go wrong there. What would be better for the cigars is a menu, but if you want one, you can go up to the cigar stand and pick some out. I mean, Occidental is pretty close, so you can always do that instead if you want a more chill atmosphere. Food is definitely a little pricey here, so be prepared to spend a pretty penny, but their happy hour from 4-7pm on Mondays through Fridays is a great deal for their drinks.\n\nBe prepared for the frat bros, though. It's the Fi-Di, so you can be assured that you'll run into them every now and again, but at The Cigar Bar & Grill, they congregate. And, yell. A lot. Oh, bonus points for the salsa floor on weekends. There's a dress code? Which, I kind of understand, because they're trying to class up their establishment, but they have hipster bartenders with handlebar mustaches, and people are smoking. That doesn't exactly spell classy.", "author": "Danny C."}

The last two in our group are waiting to get in and the lady at the front desk won't let them in because one of our friends is wearing sneakers. Yet, there are other people in the bar wearing sneakers, but she says since we are there after 10, she can't make an exception and she won't refund us, even though we literally just paid. The best she offers is tickets for another night, but we are visiting from out of town. I ask to speak to a manager and she says they are all busy. I feel like she cheated us and wasn't very kind about the situation. Don't go here, bad business and shitty customer service\"\n\n***Amendment: I want to update my review since Cigar Bar read it and got in contact with me. They apologized and offered a full refund, gift vouchers, and VIP tickets, which they mailed to me. They definitely made up for my negative experience and I would go back and give them a second chance next time I'm in town. I want to thank them for taking the time to acknowledge what happened and remedy the situation. They even went an extra step by offering the vouchers and VIP tickets.

It's an interesting mix of FiDi workers having afterwork drinks and for some, enjoying their cigars while they're at it. It's large enough for bigger office gatherings yet there are single tables along the perimeter for more intimate conversations. Larger groups will appreciate the party platters of guac and chips or quesadillas. I've also had the fried calamari and chicken wings which were both satisfying companions to post-work beers. Happy hours from 4-7pm with $1 off drafts. \n\nHere's a nice tip. I find the Cigar Bar to be at it's best early in the week post happy hour. By then, the crowd has typically thinned out and the patio is a pleasant place to enjoy a night cap or to have a good catch-up with friends. It truly is all about the patio at the Cigar Bar.", "author": "Jon L."}

The $6 \"Nonoffensive Red\" wine special was a delicious, spicy Italian. Good deal for post-happy hour in this part of town.\n\nThe not so good: Sometimes you get what you pay for, and this certainly applied to my cigar. I'm no cigar connoisseur, but my cheaper-end ($9) cigar was pretty nasty; no flavor besides damp, dusty ashtray. The other reviews indicate that there is some good stuff in that case; I guess you just have to dole out some cash to enjoy it.", "author": "Elizabeth N."}

She was able to lock a table only for 10 people, and I am glad I was one of her guests because I was wanting to check out this place for a while. I was not too excited about their menu since I looked it up here on yelp. Was hoping it would surprise me when we dinned but was not the case. I did like their selection of cocktails and beers. I enjoyed a watermelon beer all night, well more than one, and loved the hint of watermelon it had at the end. Regarding drinks, I found them to be pretty affordable (inexpensive).\n\nThe food was just ok, we shared several plates and some of them were very good while others were not exciting at all. We had the sweet plantains with mole (a-ok); we also had the ceviche and tuna tartar (my two favorites); we had a couple of the quesadillas (size was perfect for our big group); We also shared some fries (pretty tasty!) as well as a flan (too sweet for me, but everyone else liked it a lot).\n\nAfter dinner, we then stayed for the live salsa party...the group became larger so it was tons of fun to hang with friends, drink and burn some of the calories from dinner by dancing salsa all night. I honestly loved the band and the atmosphere, I have been to various salsa socials and clubs here in San Francisco, and i liked the crowd here more than any other places. I also loved that the band was playing pretty good and songs that I could sing to!. Again, drinks were not pricey so it made it for a great time. I had to pay for water ($2) but this is common for salsa places.\n\nThe one thing I hated, but it is expected, after all is a cigar bar....is all the smoke! I left smelling like I had smoked all day and the combination of cigars and cigarrettes smells is not pleasant at all...but again, that is something that you cant control and should expect, nature of the place.\n\nWould love to come back here to dance. Definitely one of the best places in SF to get your Salsa Groove on!", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

While I was hoping it would be the indoor version that wasn't the case. I'm assuming it's gotta be a legal reason behind it. Anyway I was pleasantly surprised to see that a place I went to about 10 B.Y. (before yelp) was still around and doing strong business.  The place seemed to be as cool and hip as it was before.  The difference now is I am the right age to appreciate it.  I remember when I was younger I felt like the kid in the crowd.  Now I finally feel like the crowd.  \n\nService was solid and they have a great selection of cigars.  Mind you I have no clue what is hot these days in the world of cigars so the in house experts are very helpful in helping make the right choice for you and your budget. I give kudos to places the specialize in something and the staff is not pretentious about their wares. Drinks are pretty average so don't expect the bartenders to wow you like some of the more liquor centric bars in the area.  Not saying the drinks are bad but you're here to enjoy cigars and the drinks are there to compliment the experience.  \n\nThey also have a nice dance floor and they had a live band as well.  There were salsa lessons earlier that looked fun but I was just a spectator so I have little details except everyone involved was really into it.  There was a long line and cover later in the evening (I think around 10) so keep that in mind. Overall I had a fun little time there and look forward to coming back again.", "author": "Joco F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-20", "description": "I went for salsa; can't comment on the food - but I'll touch on the venue, drinks, service and salsa:\n\nSalsa:  Note that what's taught in the intro lesson and nearly exclusively what's danced is Cuban salsa - not mambo/New York or West Coast/LA style. Was about 60% beginners / those whom couldn't dance; about 10% good dancers and a mix of the rest.  I was there from just after the dance lesson until midnight and often dance club crowds change depending on the time of the evening, so the mix may be different later.  The dance floor was small and the crowd made it tight.  A mix of predominately 20 and 30-somethings and... a collection of 50 and 60 year old, older Latino men.  Air conditioning was left off - don't know if that was intentional or by accident - so it became HOT fast.  \n\nMusic:  Band that night was excellent.  A mix of salsa - both Cuban and traditional, bachata, chacha; even some Mexican folk music.\n\nService:  many of the Yelp reviews mention poor bar service.  I see why.  While I didn't have much trouble getting served (as some report), the service did come with an attitude.  Unsure if these bar tenders make much $ off of tips, but... if not, I can see why.\n\nThe Venue:  love it.  A wonderful space for a restaurant, outdoor cigar bar and salsa club.  The dance floor was small; but the layout of the cigar area and restaurant lent to an interesting mixed use.\n\nFor me it would be a \"No\" about going back EXCEPT for the music.  The salsa wasn't good enough; too many non-dancers tromping around in the way on the floor; WAY too hot; and mediocre bar service = nah. Not worth it.  But for the right band, good friends and a great cigar, I'd tolerate it.", "author": "M F."}

The carmelized plantains almost made up for it - they were pillowy soft and perfectly decadent.\n\nWhen it came time to pay with our \"coupon\" (which we mentioned to our waitress as soon as we sat down) the guy behind the bar made a big, extravagant fuss over it.

The only downside is that their restroom is really small for such a large establishments. It is what it is I suppose.

At first, we were served by the bar tender with dark hair and a beard, who was fine. The light haired bar tender was taking shots. He eventually took over serving us. When the bill came, he took off 10% for happy hour food instead of the $2 per item (over 20% off). \n\nWe politely said that we thought there was an error. He took the bill to fix it, came back, threw it in front of us and said \"Here's the buck you saved.\" In addition to being incredibly rude (especially since it was his error), this didn't make sense mathematically. \n\nI looked at the bill and saw he only discounted one item. I said that I thought the discount applied to each happy hour item not the total. \n\nHe grabbed the bill, said he was not revising it again and then threw down singles from his pocket and said \"there, now we are even.\" \n\nIf a server makes an error on the bill, the only proper response is \"I'm sorry, let me fix that\", especially at a restaurant/bar that is supposed to be nice. The fact that this employee twice responded with such rudeness (when we were polite and good nurtured about the error - I've worked in restaurants before and know that mistakes sometimes happen) is shocking to me.", "author": "Mr. X."}

They served the best meat quesadillas, bruschetta, and crab cakes. Oh, and their nachos - I've never tasted anything like it. Amazing dip and amazing flavored nachos. The drinks were alright. I didn't have any of the beer, but the tequila shot we had went down really smoothly. However, the sangria was very watered-down as were the other drinks my friends got.\n\nAmbience: The service was AWESOME - and I'm comparing this with my experience at Lake Chalet (when we had a banquet). They moved around us and didn't complain at all. They smiled the whole time and asked every single person if they wanted food to eat and carried around crab cakes/brushetta everywhere. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars (besides the watered-down drinks) is the cigar smell. It's probably something that is part of the ambience and not really something that can be changed, but I couldn't stand the smell. It wasn't suffocating, but still, it wasn't pleasant.", "author": "Gina T."}

Me too!\n\nIt was less than a week before my birthday and I had no idea what I wanted to do.  My boyfriend suggested having Cigar Bar as a meeting place for dancing and drinks.  After reviewing and noticing that they also served dinner, I was in.\n\nEmailed Amanda - the host to book a party of 8 for dinner.  She was responsive: quick and very helpful, never being upset when we asked to be moved outside (if there were heat lamps - there were) as well as increasing our party to 10 (when we arrived we were almost 13 in total).\n\nWe all had an amazing time: great service, fun music, smoked amazing cigars... Always happy to come back and would definitely encourage people to come.\n\nPS. The Cigar smoke does tend to get heavy out in the patio area, but on the dance floor you barely smell it.

There's a strip club just up the hill if you're a man who has never seen a pair of boobies before.  \n\nThe drinks were pretty reasonable for San Francisco pricing standards and the noise level isn't that loud so you could actually have a normal conversation with your friend or date. They have this closet full of different types of cigars.  I really liked the one with the chocolate aftertaste amd was like a zero calorie indulgence.

We were able to flag a waitress down and make the chair request, but it took to long. Thus a few of us, went to the front bar area and sat to dine there instead. It was a smoke free zone in front, so it made the dinner a bit more bearable. Again, it took awhile to flag a waitress down, but we were able to place our dinner order in with drinks.  I was able to try the 3 mini sliders, fried calamari, scallop over mash potato and steak. The scallop was my favorite dish! \n\nI would suggest asking for a table out doors, so it would be more breathable and bearable if you are having dinner. \n\nAfter 9:30 or 10pm?

I frequent this establishment often, and will probably continue to do so even after the following incident.This review is for Elena, the bitchy waitress that we had the misfortune of meeting about 4 weeks ago. \n\nWe came early on a Saturday around 8:30pm. The crowd was not insane, and Cigar Bar was fairly mellow. I came in with a group of 5 (myself included), and easily found a table. After waiting 10 minutes for a waiter, my friends and I decided to order drinks at the bar. Drink one was done, but our waiter was nowhere in sight. Finally after asking a busser if he could help us find out who would serve us, Elena arrived to our table. Her initial greeting was dry and distant, and made us feel like she must have other important things to do other than deal with our order. Strike one. Strike two happened when one of my friends asked if Elena could add a new drink to her open tab at the bar. Elena replied that this was impossible, and that my friend would need to close the tab before continuing to order. Not a biggie except that my friend still wanted to order a drink while she closed her tab. Elena refused. Instead she insisted that my friend close her tab first, and then she would come back and take our order. With that, Miss Thang turned and walked away. The rest of us didn't even have a chance to order food, or anything simply because Elena decided to call the shots. \n\nI understand policies whatever, but why not allow my friend to simply order a new drink on our groups tab while she collected her card from the bar? Why not let the rest of us order in the meantime? Again, Cigar Bar was not busy, Elena had one other table (I watched her since I was quite taken aback by her behaviour) and there was no reason to postpone service. Strike three happened when Elena took about 30 minutes to return to our table, to finally take our order. Not cool, especially when my friends and I regularly spend a pretty penny at Cigar Bar, and are pretty awesome tippers. We left the restaurant questioning whether we would return, but alas one waitress does not reflect Cigar Bar as a whole. \n\nI'll just Yelp my experience so that if Elena ever reads this she can whip into shape, and maybe the next table she serves will fare much better.", "author": "Gabriella C."}

I have been there many times, but not in the last 6 or 7 years due to intense work schedule.  And I was very pleasantly surprised.  They have added a soundproof glass entrance to the courtyard, which keeps the noise level down for the new condos across the street, but more importantly it minimizes wind in the courtyard.  There are also waitresses now, which is a huge convenience factor.  And, of course, there is a dance floor with 2nd bar and coat check where before there were offices full of cubicles.  I'd say they have roughly doubled their floor space from the old days.\n\nTop-flight Latin bands, as always (Josh Jones Ensemble on the Saturday night I was there).

My boyfriend had a vape, and if you know anything about vapes, they come in various sizes. Okay, we are in a cigar bar, so one would assume you could smoke a vape. For goodness sake if you are allowed to puff on a stinky cigar that puts tobacco in the air, what's the problem with vapor? One bartender passed by and rudely told him to stop smoking his vapor, which he did.  My boyfriend has a pretty big device so he couldn't fit it in his pocket.  He held it in his hand the rest of the night and did not puff on it.  One bartender walks by and says \"you've been warned\" as if he was threatening us for a fight.  Then second bartender comes up with a security guard and is yelling at us.  When we told them he wasn't even smoking the vape just holding it because it wouldn't fit in his pocket, his response was \"he shouldn't be holding it then.\"YOU have to be kidding me, if they were doing their job and actually watching us instead of making assumptions, they would have known we were abiding by the rules.

I visited this establishment on Saturday, March 4th, 2017. I stopped by around midnight. The place was empty, yet they charged a 10 dollar cover. The people working at the door were rude and dressed unprofessionally (baggy clothes, shirts not tucked in -- no style for a place that claims to have class). I do not drink, I was there for a birthday celebration. At one point, I stepped outside for a cigarette and when I tried to re-enter, the same lady guard that checked my ID tried to deny re-entry, although my hand was stamped. She went far enough to say that it's not their stamp. Only when the cashier reluctantly nodded at her, she let me back in, without even apologizing. Several of my friends stopped by some time later and one of them was denied entry, because he was wearing sneakers...yet, he was dressed better than any of the people working at this place. When the birthday guy tried to argue with the door personnel to let our friend, wearing sneakers, inside -- the birthday guy was kicked out. The birthday guy refused to leave without a refund of the cover charge and sat down at one of the tables. Few minutes later, roughly 6 goons, working for this establishment surrounded our group and essentially forced the birthday guy to leave. As a result, 8 of us had to leave as well after having paid 10 bucks a person. I will get everyone to post a negative review for this place from our group. I should also mention that I am myself 35 years old, and most people in our group were of the same age. We did not act inappropriately or irresponsibly at any time.

I recalled this place from the good old days when I use to reside in SF. The drinks are better here and the mojito is one of the better one's in the city (read strong) I even tried the one with top shelf rum (forgot the name) and I think it was not an upgrade over the regular version. I haven't tried any food there but did go through the cigars they have I guess they are priced ok for place bar. The think I like about this spot is they follow instructions so if you are picky about how you want your drinks this place is good.\nThe entry fee for the LIVE band is a cash grab IMO as all the people are not here from dance and music.", "author": "Elvis A."}

I love the airy patio in the middle of the place and the disposition of the building reminds me of some old Italian Villa. I usually go there for their salsa night, staff is always nice and capable. But not last night. Last night I received the worst customer service ever!! I am a manager in a upscale restaurant in SF and watching a person behaving like that made me incredibly mad. So this is what happened: it was around 1:30, the place was closing, my husband and I with another couple went to close our tabs. There was a guy behind the bar, asian, an absolute clown with an arrogant attitude and no idea at all of what customer service is. He asked for my last name, and since I have two on my credit card, I told him both. He looked at me like I was an idiot and mumbled something about picking a f###ing last name. I was in shock! But that was not it. It was my friend turn! When she asked to close her tab he answered that he didn't have her cc. She asked again, she spelled her last name but the guy was so full of himself, acting like the king of the bar, arrogant, awful, kept saying he didn't have it. She even pointed her cc that was in a glass but nothing.. I couldn't believe my eyes! He was just standing there giving us attitude instead of looking for the effing card (which he had!!!) My friend's husband lost his patience, not  because of the fact that the he couldn't find her cc but merely because of the guy's attitude!! It was too much!! My friend yelled the guy to stop being an ass, put himself together and try to find the cc instead of being a clown. Guess what he did? Call the bouncer and kick my friend out! He treated us like trash! It was just unbelievable! I hope my review will get to the right person. What happened yesterday goes against any principle of the industry and was a total shame for such a nice bar!", "author": "Ashley W."}

When I peered onto the dance floor, I was immediately mesmerized by the seasoned dancers that were showing off their moves.  I've taken salsa lessons before, but my skills were nowhere near these guys.  I was having enough fun just standing there watching these couples make their moves look like they flowed out of them as naturally as walking down the street.  (Ahem.. Sorry for lack of a better analogy!)\n\nWe spent a good amount of time in there and I'd like to personally thank the guys who entertained me by letting me watch them smoke cigars for the first time.  Please note:  If you smoke a cigar, you are supposed to cut the tip first.  I witnessed and laughed at the said friend of the guy who tried to light and smoke a cigar without cutting the tip off.  Wondering what was wrong, he looked at his friend who instead of puffing his own cigar, *inhaled* it instead because he wanted to get a \"taste\".  Much to my own amusement, the guy who inhaled his cigar told his friend to cut the tip off first and come back.  When he came back, I assumed he didn't know how much he was supposed to cut off because he cut off about an inch, leaving only about two thirds of the cigar left.  Needless to say, these guys were such good sports and asked me take pictures of them with their cigars in their mouths, chronicling their first cigar experience.  \n\nGood times..", "author": "Lorie N."}

The Fried plantains with black beans and sour cream where on point... Almost a dessert. I'm Salvadorean and trust me when I say they were good! Their meatballs where also good. Overall their tapas are good. I also got two Mojito now that I will say wasn't consistent. The first one tasted like a straight up mixer and the second one was straight Bacardi. So my diet coke and Bacardi was my drink of the night.\nAs far as cigars go I don't think they have a wide selection but some of them are good. If you're a huge aficionado you're better off bringing your own. The patio does get pretty packed after 11 so if you can catch stable before then you will be set.\nThe music is always great!

All we heard was that it was salsa night with a live band.  Sounds good to me!  We got there around 7:30PM and the place had somewhat of a mixed crowd.  The table situation was a little off and we weren't sure if we sat ourselves or not since we actually wanted some dinner.  There was no hostess.  \n\nWe go to the bar and asked if we can order food there and the bartender gave us a snooty response.  We ordered our drinks there and then snagged a table when it opened.  That all just seems very unorganized.\n\nFood: The fish and chips were not good. The fish was way fishy and lacked all sorts of flavor.  Their house made tarter sauce was no better.  My friend had the scallops and they were not all that either.  Just blah. \n\nService: Our waitress couldn't be any more fake.  She turned on the smile as soon as she came to our table, but you just know when someone is not genuine.  I mean, if you're not having a good night, just be pleasant, don't need to fake it.  The bartender, well, she's just a little too sarcastic for my taste.  I asked a legitimate question, you don't have to be smart about it.  \n\nOverall: The band that played was pretty awesome.  The patrons can be a little rude when it comes to giving you space to dance. I was choking with the cigar/cigarette smoke from the patio by the end of the night.

They have a bar area, an outside area in the middle, and a big dance floor, so there's a good amount of room and you'd feel comfortable even if you didn't feel like dancing. They have live salsa music on Saturday nights, and everyone is friendly and eager to dance even if you have no idea what you're doing! Cover is $10, which they stop charging after a certain time (1 AM?) when it gets close to closing (2 AM).", "author": "Cynthia W."}

I really enjoyed the vibe at Cigar Bar on a Thursday night.  They have a lot of space, which is really nice considering all the people who like to cram into San Francisco bars, and having the options of multiple rooms, bars, patios, and seating was a huge plus.  \n\nWe spent some time in the main bar area, tried our luck at the pool table, enjoyed a brief sojourn in the patio, but mostly used the time to catch up with out of town friends.  \n\nIn terms of the drinks though, I only had 2, made by two different bar tenders.  I went with my standard Dark and Stormy first and it was not good at all.  It was strong, but that wasn't what I was going for.  The flavor was not doing it for me.  The second time around I tried my luck with the Pomegrita (pomegranite marg) made by a different bartender and it was much better.  Not phenomenal, but definitely enjoyable.  \n\nSo it seems like you come here to enjoy the atmosphere of the music, cigars, and various seating options.  It'd be nice if all their drinks were as impressive as the rest of the venue, but I would definitely go back since an n of 2 is certainly not statistically significant.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

Walk down to a dim lit basement, where you'll get a feel of brick walls and cobblestone floors.  The dark colored wooden furniture adds a feel of Italy or Spain, while the smells of cigars eases into view, you get easily taken away by this place.  \n\nAnd every where you look, there are men dressed in suits holding a glass of whiskey or bourbon, or even a glass a wine.  Rarely do you see shot glasses or Pabst here, so it definitely sophisticated in a way.  \n\nPool table in the back, and a outdoor fountain area with couches for you to smoke, so it was quite pleasant.  Too bad there wasn't some kind of music to make it nicer. \n\nI didn't try the food, but I got their Tears and Tequila drink.  It was very refreshing with all the cucumbers and spicy kick.  The rest of the crew had wine and imported beers, and they were pretty happy with the selection.\n\nThis is pretty much a more social spot, for a bit of a Marina crowd, and a bit of Financial district.  So expect that superiority attitude to come with, even from the bartenders and bouncer.  I seriously had to say excuse me, into a girls ear, 10x before i finally had to gently push her to get through.  I know you're busy talking with a bunch of boys lady, but don't mean you can block traffic with your flat ass.  And the bartender chick, smile a bit please.  Yes you are considered hot, but attitude makes your hotness go down, way down.   \n\nSo if the staff was friendlier, crowd was more pleasant, had some tunes, I can see myself chilling here.  Its got a nice ambiance to it, where you feel very relaxed and coming here after work, I can totally see it.  So you get only an OK from me.", "author": "Janice F."}

No one ever came to the table, so we stayed a little longer.

For a place whose very name is based on the notion that one could light up some cigars inside, you have to walk a long way to get to the cigar part of Cigar Bar.\n\nOne of my compatriots had brought a selection of cigars with him, and asked me which one I wanted.  I asked him for the one that wouldn't symbolize me satisfying my oral fixation by chewing on a giant leafy dick---the one that even Freud would agree was just a cigar.  He kinda smiled at me confusedly, so I ended up with an El Capitan Robusto Habana de Honduras Al Segundo De Mas Profundo.  I think.\n\nThe cigar was nice enough, but the tray of bourbon that soon made its way out was far, far nicer.  And so I sat on the deep leather couch and chewed on my giant Carribean leafy dick and drank the smooth, amber salve of the south.  And just as the profusion of chemicals contained in all of the above were finally beating my emotions into something resembling contentedness, someone said \"so, who's getting the girls?\"  The sentence took awhile to lodge appropriately in my brain, because it made no sense the first three times I repeated it to myself.  Then, I became concerned: crap, was I supposed to bring....uh, girls with me?  Was that on the invite?  \"Last names A-L bring cigars, last names M-Q bring girls, last names R-Z bring bourbon?\"  Had I blown it?  Where does one even get girls at this time of night?  And will they take AmEx?\n\nInstead, apparently, my companion was referring to what maybe possibly is a practice of corraling one or more otherwise unattached young women to keep company with us gents while we smoked our cigars.  I was not familar with this ritual, but given that my companions managed, in several passes through the bar, to actually bring back more than a few women to sit and talk with us, I am forced to acknowledge this must be a thing.  Later on, when one of my companions left to walk a woman back to her car, and it took him more than a half hour, I decided it must REALLY be a thing.\n\nThe whole situation was very surreal.  And I'm sure it showed---I regressed back to eighth grade, standing on the far side of the gym from the girls and dancing with absolutely no one.  This whole thing makes my uncomfortable.  My palms are starting to sweat just writing this, so let's wrap it up.\n\nThanks, Cigar Bar, for taking me back to the childhood I was using your booze in an attempt to finally kill from my mind.  Also, I had to scrape my tongue the next morning.  Never fun.", "author": "Ben P."}

Stepping down the stairs from the entrance and going behind the curtain led me to a warm, inviting, alcoholic Oz.\n\nI came here last night for a couple of drinks and potentially some food.  Although I didn't sample it, it looks like they had a great liquor section- especially scotch.  The wood bar is sleek, and they get bonus points for having those hooks under the bar where you can hang your purse.\n\nI managed to sample a few glasses of wine (my favorite was the Zinfande- that's how they spelled it on the menu), but they also offer a $5 wine special which was named \"not so offensive red wine\" or something of that nature.  I like a place that has a sense of humor.  I managed to sample the chips/pico/guacamole combo (my companion said the guac needed more lime, and sadly he was right), as well as the veggie risotto, which was delicious...and I'm not a risotto person.\n\nThe menu could have been a little more extensive, in my opinion, but as the word \"bar\" comes before the word \"grill,\" I shouldn't be too surprised.  The patio looked like a nice place to hang out on one of the 5 warm SF days a year, although the trek to the bathroom is not something I would recommend in an inebriated state.\n\nI really liked it here, but why only 4 stars?

Don't get me wrong, it is an honor to be a part of a loved one's wedding party and at this point, planning bachelorette parties and bridal showers comes second nature.\n\nSo you can image that when my friend (yes, I was one of her BMs) informed me that the groomsmen were not planning a bachelor party for the groom, I jumped in and took on the challenge. (Partially because I thought the idea of a bachelor party could be more fun and partially because it sucked that the groomsmen weren't doing anything.....lame.)\n\nAnywhooo, after much research I decided that we would start off the evening with dinner and cigars at The Cigar Bar & Grill in the Financial District. We were warmly welcomed and promptly seated in the patio area. Knowing that it was a cigar lounge, I knew that they would have an extensive Cigar menu. However, it was such a pleasant surprise that the dinner menu was quite respectable and extremely well priced. I don't think there was a dish over $20. The BF and I shared the salmon and flat iron steak and were really happy with it. With a somewhat larger party, we had several assigned servers who always kept the cocktails flowing. My drink of the evening was the Caipirinhas--delish!\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is warm with a Spanish influence. Inside you can find pool tables, bar seating, and some comfy couches.

Consistent drinks (sangria, mojitos, mint juleps, the list goes on..), friendly non-pretentious management and bar staff, a diverse crowd, a solid menu, and the option to be inside or out is what keeps me coming back.  \n\nIt has the charm of a small place that recognizes you when you come in and makes you feel welcome regardless of why you are here.  I have been here for numerous happy hours, farewells, Kapakahi, nights of music, dancing, and smoking.  What also brings a pleasant sense of familiarity is you never know whom you will run into when you're here.\n\nI must mention that Neil, the dark and handsome fellow who walks around and greets you with a genuine smile, is one of the sweetest people I have met in the city.  Great with names and faces and makes you feel like a friend you have known for years.  I only wish him and this space continued growth and success.  Keep up the great work, Neil!  Never give up. :)\n\n5 stars in my book.", "author": "Winnie W."}

Some came for a birthday party in a banquet room, others came to dance.  Few of us came to smoke.  There was no cover if you arrived before the Salsa band was scheduled to start at 9:30pm.  $7 cover after 9:30pm.  I did not see long lines at the door.\n\nWe all ordered drinks, and some food at differing times.  Waitresses were very friendly and attentive even latter when it got crowded.\n\nThe salsa band \"Conjunto Picante\" was very good.  There was a dance performance by \"Its Only Dance\" also very good.  Main bummer was small dance floor so we danced in an adjoining room.\nIf your main goal is salsa dancing then you may want to try Cocomo.\nGood music with large dance floor, but no food, no table service.\n \nAll in all it was a great night out.

Given the lack of skill of all but 2 people on the dance floor, it seems as though this is not the place to come to for some serious dancing.  But, it is an excellent place to chill and catch up with friends, since the music doesn't permeat the place to the point that you can't hear what one another is saying.\n\nMinus one point for the nasty mojito's.  You would think that in a latin place they would know how to make a decent mojito.  It was so tart that I couldn't finish it.  Now that's a serious problem if I can't finish a drink.

My wife and I arrived around 10pm and grabbed a seat outside.  One of the servers, after walking past us several times, briskly informed us that table service was finished for the night and we must order directly from the bar (more on this later).  I proceed to the bar and receive the same quality of service.  I was passed up while waiting at the humidor just to buy a cigar and told to sit tight and he would be right with me.  That moment never came.  While discussing my options, i noticed a table still receiving table service from a server, and here I sat still without drink and cigar.  After about 25 minutes of zero service we decided to leave and go elsewhere.  I found it strange that a band was playing in the open air area and I was informed that they would not be closing until around 1am, yet no servers were supposedly working.

So, you 20 somethings with your suits so nice, listen up... Proper etiquette for a \"stinky\" stogie; remove the band after approximately 12 puffs (should already be on it's way off from the heat). The reason to keep it on is to prevent the tobacco from tearing before it heats up. Now enjoy and savor the stogie, but do not inhale! Now to order the appropriate cocktail; With cigar in one hand and a glass of port, cognac, bourbon/scotch, or wine (preferably Cabarnet Sauvignon or Mourvedre) in the other. Before you know it, you'll be a stinky cigar pro, chatting up Castro talk.\n\nAll in all as a lady, I love this place for some quality people watching and good conversation.

Could be a nice date place on a warm day. However, there was a large group of very vocal people celebrating birthday when we were there. Very very loud. \n\nGood: Several nice brandy options to choose from. Extensive drink options.\n\nBad: Food is mediocre and ridiculously expensive. Who charges $25 for quesedillas? (Happy hour prices are much more reasonable. $2 garlic fries and $10 quesedillas.) \n\nOverall: It's a nice enough place. The outdoor courtyard is a plus, especially if you want to smoke while you drink. The inside decor has low ceiling, tables, dim lighting, natural wood beams on the ceiling. It gets loud, so carrying on a conversation might be a bit difficult. There are some nooks and crannies away from the bar where it's less crowded.", "author": "Su K."}

Drunk Marina kids in polos, and tipsy gals in awkward stillettos, pretend-Salsa dancing to authentic Cuban music... which,sadly has to end each night before 12:30am, which pisses all the drunkies off (but keeps complaining neighbors at bay). \n\nThey need to get a sound system-- the musicians have to set-up and break-down thier own sound... not very professional AT ALL, espcially considering the fact that the line is 1 block long and there's a substantial cover charge.\n\nGreat, friendly, staff.

LOSER, I'd bet he's homeless by now.  \n\n(Alright, so there just might have been one, two, or ninety-four other times, but there was no dare involved, which doesn't make for a very interesting review.... OK?)\n\nNow,  I am the worst nightmare of the women's lib movement, but gimme a break.  If that 16 year old could do it, male or female, then I can do it, simply based on sheer will.\nI was right.\nI did it alright.....\nSuffice to say that my parents grounded me not for one month, but for three months.  THREE.  Put a real dent in my social life.\n\nWell - - forward almost 20 years and there I was at Cigar Bar.\n\nWhat a cool, cool place!!!!\nIndoor bar area with bar seating and some tables - - outdoor patio area with lots more tables and cigar smoking allowed.  Now, I do not smoke cigars, but totally believe people should be allowed to smoke them if they should so choose......... just don't blow it in my hair now.  Please.\n\nVarious people were here, and I know this because I entered completely, stone-cold sober.\n\nI drank with two friends here, starting off with my basic \"Sapphire and Tonic.\"  I do not know how many I had.  I don't care to remember because I will never drink that evil liquid again.  \n\nThat said, what I do remember of those drinks were that they were STRONG and served in tall glasses with 2 straws.  Two straws means.... double the pace of drinking.  Right?\n\nBelieve me - - that's right.\n\n\nI will DEFINITELY be back to this place.\nWhether or not they will actually let me in remains to be seen.... those guy friends of mine are prone to exaggeration.  :-)  \n\n\nPS - No Mojitos here... but then I guess it is kind of a \"foo-foo\" drink to have asked for, in hindsight.  I mean, it is a - (gasp) - CIGAR bar.... for the real men.  (whatever)  But, they have Macallan 18 for those of you who love Scotch, the manly man drink!!\n***************\nEdited to add:\nTwice now, someone has pointed out that Cigar Bar does indeed have Mojitos... and one claims it's the best Mojito too.  I stand  corrected.  All I know is my friend asked me what I wanted to drink and I said Mojitos... he went, asked, came back and said, \"No Mojitos.  What else ya want?\"  So I thought... no mojitos here.  My bad!", "author": "Grace K."}

And what other place in the city has the specialty and freedom to smoke and NOT inhale (like some people) on a cigar.   \n\nWe got some bites, some shots, and a few beers during the special.

It's like a cross between McDonald fries and In and Out, so you can imagine the greatness concealed in each individual fry.  And for only 2 bucks a pop, get yourself an order per couple.

There's two descriptions I never thought I'd use in the same sentence about the same person.  Anyway I had been here a couple times for small after work celebrations of one sort or another and they have a great bar.  They pay attention to little details in their cocktails - like the cherries in their manhattans are really tasy bings - not those nasty candied ones.  On these visits the drinks were good and I noticed a very well made guacamole but never really thought of it as a restaurant.\n\nSo it comes time to plan our holiday party and it gets turfed to me.  I have 4 or 5 restaurants put together proposals for me and throw in Cigar Bar & Grill too becuase I know my boss will ask me why they aren't a contender.\n\nThe food and beverage manager sent me menus and wine lists and I had never tasted any of their food other than the guacamole but my friend tells me they have a really great kitchen now.   So we put together a menu heavy on passed appetizers and a hot buffet aimed at pleasing vegetarians as well as omnivores and decide to book even though I'm thinking we can get better food at my first choice.\n\nWell they did a great job.  The crab cakes with remoulade were excellent as were these fried polenta deals with, as I recall, cherry peppers and gorgonzola.  Also very good was the ceviche along with hard to screw up standards like procuitto and melon and smoked salmon on cucumber slices.  The buffet was perfectly grilled marinated skirt steak and a vegetarian dish they whipped up for the occasion.  When they found out I had one vegan in my party of 50, the chef prepared a special meal that Mark said was great.\n\nOnce again the cocktails were expertly prepared and the wines we selected excellent and reasonably priced.  We came in under budget even though no one left remotely hungry and probably not sober.   \n\nThis is a great little place.  Nice to have the outdoor courtyard for a cigar, great cocktails, well conceived wine list and really nicely prepared food. Live music too - latin jazz the night we were there.   I'd plan another event there in a second.  4 stars only to prove it isn't some kind of corporate nepotism.", "author": "Jon R."}

I've heard great things; but somehow things just always came up when friends or coworkers had gatherings here.\n\nThe atmosphere here is amazing, in the sense that it's very laid back and yet also very energetic. There's a very broad range of people here, yuppies just off work for HH, moms n pops (and grandpas too) who want to enjoy some cigars and a good drink, artsy fartsy urbanites, and older executives who book up one of the rooms, the list just keeps going. I love that I would not feel out of place in either my work clothes or casual clothes, though I do not suggest coming here in clubbing clothes, not that kind of pregame spot.\n\nI only tried a few things on the one page menu, the calamari and garlic fries. Very crispy and savory. Love the shoestring fries! And nicely breaded but not overly coated crusty calamari. Delish!\n\nThey had a special on the makers mark 46 for $8! Had to give that a try, or 3. By the time i went back for the 3rd, they were already out. Shucks. Went very well with the cigar (mild) I had. I'd recommend it.\n\nThe place itself is very nice. Takes you out of the city. Awesome that you have to walk down stairs to get to it. Fairly dim lighting when you walk in. To the right is the bar, to the left is the door to the patio seating area, straight ahead is the billiard room (which surprisingly is the most well lit area if you want that). We sat out on the patio so that we'd be able to smoke. Theres a fountain in the middle, and benches and tables all around. People are just sitting drinking smoking and dancing!! Very awesome. It was very relaxing to just sit there with the 46 in one hand, the cigar in the other, just listening to the salsa music and catching up with friends. Nice to just take it slow. And my friend who actually supplied the cigars (he runs primostogies.com, check it out, those cienfuegos are money and he'll steer you right if you're not sure what you want!) convinced me i must go to Europe though it didnt take much since I've already been dying to go to Sicily since two years back.

And they serve food well into the night.  And, of course, there's the cigar case.  It's just too bad the drinks aren't as well-crafted as the ambience.  \n\nDespite its large size (and the $7 cover we got slapped with for showing up after 10), this place was packed with more young, beautiful, rich(?) people than I usually see in a month, running the full length of the skanky-classy spectrum.

Not sure what type of dressing they used but it tasted like a sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  It was just the dressing that did the trick on the mixed greens...\n\nSecond Course:  Potato Hash, Black Beans, and Rice - Potato Hash was under cooked; Could've been season better and cooked longer.  Black Beans were perfectly cooked but under seasoned.  Rice was just rice.\n\nThird Course:  Pesto Pasta - Yes, this was what I was waiting for...  Something seasoned just right and the texture just felt like it was cooked right!  Definitely a must if coming here.\n\nMain Course:  Tilapia - Lime salt with a creamy cheese sauce...

In between sips of delicious mojitos and caribbean rum drinks, she managed to corner me in the bathroom and give me the \"if you break his heart, I'll kick your a*s\" speech. She wound up never really liking me, but I was always left trying to figure out the name of the bar the cliched speech happened in so I could revisit the place under more pleasant circumstances. Ya, I never really liked her either.\r\n\r\nLast night, I found myself once again at Cigar Bar, in one of those odd-ball, albeit more pleasant, moments... experiencing some serious bonding with my coworkers during the Thursday night, packed-to-the-britches, happy hour.

The smallish dance floor served its purpose for letting folks move about to the live music (next time a band with some horns instead of just a Casio would be nice).

Im from LA and in my experience, with a bar that crowded, you have to choke a bitch to get the bartender's attention. You people are civilized, so that was completely unnecessary. The drinks we got were good, good enough to remember. I liked the primo mojito and the capirinha. I also got my standard rum and coke. They also have a huge selection of single-malt scotches, tequilas and rums. \nSInce there was a birthday in the group, we all did a chocolate cake shot. The bartender was accommodating and genuinely friendly. \n\nThe patio situation was confusing. There were some reserved tables, some that weren't (and those tables were filled with people) and another ton of people just standing or finding any flat object to sit on. The ratio of cigar smokers to non-cigar smokers was tipped in favor of the non; so when we finally found a table to sit at and i lit up, i got a few angry glances. Sorry, but i wasn't about to move or put out my stick.\n\nSome of the people i was with wanted to dance but there just wasnt any room for that, nor enough to see the salsa dancers. Lots of people ran into me, accidentally bumped into me and stepped on my toes but always promptly apologized -my kind of people, the nice ones.

I drove right past it once, and while I was waiting in line I realized the crowd was pretty old. As I entered after paying an $8 or $12 dollar cover charge (different) I saw that this place was packed with locals. I kid you not the age range was literally like 21-50 to 60's. lol. It's all good because I can mingle anywhere with anybody and fit right in. I'm 29 and felt like I would see my dad around the corner or something drinking some hennessy privilege. And he's in his 60's!! I also realized that I think I might be overdressed. I saw a few guys in flip flops?? wtf, T-Shirts, and shorts. Ohhh k, I guess. I noticed an outdoor smoking area for cigars and indoor smoking is welcome also. Live Band was on break but eventually came back and had the place jumping. Live Band is always a good look. The dance floor was pretty small but I guess you could make due for alot of people weren't even dancing. Just conversation. It was kind of an hassle to get a drink, maybe because your elbow to elbow. The drinks were extremely good. After getting my drink and sitting down with my comrades I noticed that it was about 11:30 and this place was booming. But within the hour I noticed that 1/3 of the patrons left??? I don't know. Maybe this is one of those places that you go to to set up your night. Kind of like a pit stop before you get to the main event. One thing that kind of ticked me off a little is that people don't really try and move to the side when one has to use the restroom.

A group of us got here early for a Saturday night so the place was pretty empty.  And yet when a few of us walked up to the bar the two bartenders standing there just stared at us.  When we requested what drinks we wanted all we got was a rude 'I'm going to need to see your IDs'.  Um, ok DICK.  Then that guy  asked the other bartender, 'Do you want to serve these kids'.  Excuse me?  We are all in our mid-twenties and last time I checked are nice, paying customers.  All night when I went up to get another drink they just acted like I was making them go out of their way, whether it was by sighing or rolling their eyes.  Fuck off.\nThe actual ambiance is alright, although we did end up being the youngest there, but seeing that a few in our group do really like cigars it worked.  Also, it was a nice night so sitting outdoors was relaxing.  It got super crowded at about 10 so we booked it out of there.  And even though I was drunk, I do remember the women's bathroom being pretty gross...you couldn't even go into one of the stalls because there was piss or something all over it.", "author": "Jessica S."}

I was looking forward to enjoying the nice weather on Friday night with friends at Cigar Bar, but at the entrance we were signaled to hold on, as the bouncer held up his hand whilst on the phone.  Being courteous, we waited, we got out our ID's, and the bouncer continued paying attention to his friend on the phone.  While we waited, the bouncer made no attempt to communicate with us that this was an emergency and that he'd attend to us soon, nor did he communicate with his friend that he had to get off the phone.  So.... I got tired of waiting and decided to walk in with my friend, the second I did that, the bouncer finally tells his friend on the phone 'Look I think I'm going to have to go' and rudely yanks the arm of my friend, pulling him out of the entrance area.   The bouncer then announced that they were at capacity and only letting people in per the number of people leaving.  At that point we decided to leave and not spend our money or wait to let this bouncer dictate when he was going to do his job.  Had this 'capacity situation' been explained to us when we arrived, we would not have had a problem waiting, but there was no effort to explain this to us and the manner at which the bouncer treated us was rude and unnecessary.\n\nDear Cigar Bar-  Perhaps you have a decent place inside(I've only been once before and thought it was alright), but the way in which your bouncer treats potential customers and acts as if managing the entrance is a part-time job is completely embarrassing.   Observing a few other similar comments on Yelp leads me to believe your outside staffing could benefit from some new hire changes and tighter supervision from upper management.

He told my group of 6 that we were not allowed to enter. He stated it was \"Male/Female\" couples night. No Males were allowed with out a female. As we looked in to the court yard, we could see dozens of males however, they were all of Latin decent. He went on to allow other groups in who approached and just laughed as we watched. Several other groups of men walked away in disgust. When we started questioning the bouncer, he was unable to handle our questions and brought out another South American gentleman to tell us we could come back another night. Still, they could not provide a reason as to why only a Man and a Women together could enter. \n\nWe will NEVER give money to this place again. We live here and go there frequently and were treated like this??!!???\n\nThere is no room for this sort of discrimination in San Francisco.

The St. Germain cocktail is worth trying if you're into champagne cocktails.  Cigar smoke wasn't too overwhelming outside.  But at some point, the laid back patrons left and it turned into a meat market - fun to watch, but that's about it.  So we left.  As far as cigar bars go, I prefer Occidental, but that's more of a laid back, old timey, intimate kind of place - less of a hot-chicks/dudes-trying-to-find-someone-else's-pants-to-get-into kind of place.

They have some enticing rustic dishes.  I've only had the appetizers and they were good.  Neil, the head chef and a partner, comes to Cigar Bar by way of MC2 and Elizabeth Daniel.

The mojito was well stirred with fresh cut mint, and the CEVICHE came on perfect crisps with an organic salad and delightful light citrus sauce. The company was unassuming, as was any cigar smoke (?). A nice place for business dates or social gathering (outside patio). (response to more reviews:  The service is not following the corporate handbook; the servers live their lives, and a customer is not their top priority. I believe, as long as they're treated like people, they will probably get everything out on time, and with high quality, and maybe a smile.)", "author": "Molly L."}

On the way to the place, we picked up some cigars from a store near our work in downtown.  We got there around 5pm and the waitress told us about discount happy hours drinks and appetizers.  We picked a table (table 75) outside at the court yard to smoke.   At 7pm one other friend showed up.  About 8pm the waitress came running in a panic mode toward our table.  She asked if we saw the people at the table in front of us (table 73).  All three of us said no.  She said they took off without paying and it was a big tab.  At this time we had total of 10 drinks and 4 appetizers and we bought one cigar from bar for our friend.  Later on we recognized some friends at the wedding rehearsal  the night before.  We bought them drinks (10 drinks total).   At this point our tab should include 20 drinks, 1 cigar and 4 appetizers.   At 10pm two more friends joined us.  This time they were charging cover charges, $7 each so it should have been $14.  We told them to put the $14 charge on the tab.  So now there are five people at our table.  We ordered 5 shots of taquila plus 1 for the waitress.    We left at around 11:30 and they gave us a bill for $862.  They didn't give us a receipt.  Our tab should have been around $350.  So I called the following Monday and asked for the receipt.   The lady (Daniela) was nice enough to mail me the receipt.  I received it in the mail on Wednesday same week.  I called the store on Wed, no one answered the phone so I left a message.   I didn't hear back so I called them again on Thursday.  This time a guy name Neil picked up the phone.   He stated that he's a manager there.   I told him about the dispute and wanted to go over the bill item by item.   He said to call him back in 5 minutes.  So I called him back and he said his waitresses told him that we were paying for table 73 and 75.  I said no, we were sitting at one table all night.  Table 73 took off without paying.  We are not responsible for that.   He said he would call me back the next day before 5pm.   I didn't hear from Neil the next day so my friend and I went over to the place after work around 5pm with the itemized bill hoping to see Neil.   First the bartender told us Neil was in the back room.  We said to go get him.  He came back and told us Neil went to the bank and will be back in 5, 10 minutes.  We said we would wait.   After 20 mins, bartender came to us and said that Neil won't be back for another 3 hours.  He said Neil would call the moment he gets back.   He didn't call that night.   We didn't get a chance to explain and to dispute.  We wanted to show him what we ordered and what was over charged.  Neil didn't give us that chance.  He was hiding from us.   We were over charged over $400.  The waitress (Kelly)  gave herself  over $140 tips.  They charged us full prices instead of Happy Hours prices.  Most items were ordered during Happy Hours.   It was a dirty trick that the waitress pulled on us.  And the management is no better off.  A bunch of crooks.  Be careful with your order next time when you go there.   Don't give them the credit card in advance.  \nOn the bill they charged us $123 for cigars, $50 cover charge, 4 appetizers,  48 drinks and over $140 tips.   Don't trust this place.    And of course we stopped payment on the credit card charge.  I would give it a zero star.", "author": "Hank C."}

A few recommendations: (1) opt for the courtyard room(s) if possible. they're gorgeous and semi-private; the pool room is small and very close to the salsa band, inviting people into your space, where they are prone to awkwardly personal conversations and/or groping. (2) don't order the full party-size cheese plate. It came with a cheese so stinky that we, a room full of stinky-cheese-loving food-loving eaters, covered it in napkins and finally transported it to a garbage can far from the small pool room space.", "author": "Celeste L."}

The music from the live band inside and the din of people provided for a nice place to enjoy a pretty good selection of cigars.\n\nOne thing I must comment on was that they didn't have a very good way of alerting the general public that our room was reserved for a private party.  We had people wandering in all night asking to play pool or just to get away from the crowd.  Towards the end of the night, two random people crashed on our couch and started having a go at each other.

They have everything from cognac to premium rums to a variety of Ports.  Their wine list is deliciously long as well.  Definitely try their caipirihna (Brazilian cocktail comprised of Brazilian white rum made from sugarcane, lime juice, and sugar).  The sangria is refreshing during those San Francisco Indian summers.  And, of course, what is a cigar bar without a well-stocked humidor?  I do not know much about cigars so I cannot vouch for it, but they have what looks to be a decent selection.  They serve food, but I do not remember what anything tastes like (a good Happy Hour does that).  There is a nice, sturdy pool table for hustlers.

What I really liked about the place was the service, a really friendly and available waitress even though it got crowded at peak time of about 7 for a Tuesday night. All this qualified it for 4 stars but the management needs to learn one thing, they are located in San Francisco and its always cold here !
