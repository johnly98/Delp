Usually this wouldn't mean a star less but they also don't have an ATM machine on the premises. Thankfully there's one across the street in a corner store otherwise I would NOTTT have been able to afford my breakfast this morning.\n\nAnyway, cute local caf\u00e9. This place is walking distance from Glen Park BART. I got the Big Scramble which was a scramble with ground chuck; comes with potatoes and toast and was ~$11. They seem to be pretty busy on the weekends but the table turnaround time is really fast, though they do seem to be rushing you out at times.\n\nI had an ok time here. Food was pretty average.

It was a great place to grab a quick no-frills breakfast--even had my first British Banger here! IIRC Tyger was the name of the owner/cook working his tail off in the kitchen. Fast forward at least 12 years...decided to stop in with my family, bragging about how awesome this diner *was*.  Not anymore. The service was abominable, our food arrived cold and it took forever to get our check. Wasn't super busy at the time, so this was surprising. I generally don't cross a place off my list after one visit, especially an old favorite, so I decided to stop in again to give it another chance. Midweek breakfast, handful of tables were full...many open ones. Told to take a seat anywhere. I sat for a quite a bit while the waitress walked over to two tables and took their orders, gave them coffee. I didn't even have a menu. No problem...I grabbed one from the counter. Sat for longer while she completely ignored me and brought over a couple of dishes to one of the tables. In walk an couple--they're told to sit anywhere. I'm still sitting, waiting for at least a cup of coffee. After the waitress is done with the table she was waiting, she walks past me again and ignores me. Then she walks over with menus and coffee for the couple who just walked in. I left and grabbed a cold coffee from the Canyon Market.\nI love my old reliable neighborhood hangs where I can get a decent no-frills meal for a decent price. Tyger's is no longer one of them.

A plate special of corned beef hash, 2 eggs, toast and coffee with a modest tip set me back $18.50, whereas just a couple years ago, a much better tasting dish with coffee and tip would have been under $10. Why the huge increase?  I looked at the menu and was blown away with their new prices. A short stack (2) pancakes for $8.50?  c'mon.... used to be under $4.

I thought it could've used a little more salt, but there was salt and hot sauce for me to use on the table. The california scramble was probably one of the biggest omelettes I've ever seen and I didn't really try it because I don't like mushrooms, but I ate a part that had sausage and those pieces are huge little chunks! (Contradictory, I know.) Along with the omelette came with buttered toast (YUM) and some home fries which were so good! It was weird though, they were like home fries but also like hash browns in a way. They were flat and super crispy like hash browns!

As we were getting close, it hit 10am, and I thought in my head that there would be no one there. Little did I know, there were already people inside, some waiting inside, and some waiting inside. We waited for about 10 minutes and got a nice seat in the back corner of this compact restaurant.\n\nIt's small, but has a really homey, old diner feeling. There was only one light on since the natural light surrounded the restaurant and a fan was shuffling air around the room. The waitress that served us was very kind. She greeted us with a smile and instantly asked us what we wanted to drink. She walks away and a man brings our waters and menus right after.\n\nI ordered the french toast combo. Which came with 2 cut french toast slices, 4 sausages, and 2 scrambled eggs. The eggs were slimy, but I kinda liked it that way. The sausages were dry, but my siblings seemed to have enjoyed it. The french toast was crunchy on the outside but soggy in the middle. Not one of the best I've ever had... but I was definitely full!\n\nMy sister ordered the turkey sausage, avacado, and jack cheese omelet. I felt like the omelets were most worth it. The menu doesnt mention that the omelets come with home fries (their version of hash browns) and toast though. So don't order it on the side! It is HUGE, and super filling.\n\nMy brother ordered the bacon, mushroom, swiss cheese omelet. The fillings were all on one side of the omelet but eh, he still liked it. He said he would never get sourdough toast again though, \"it's too sour...\" haha.\n\nOther than that, the service is great, and the price is decent. They came by to refill our water a couple times and that's sometimes rare at a busy restaurant. I've honestly had better breakfast food though. I saw that their pancakes are huge!

If they have the British Bangers (sausage), GET THAT!!!! I've only seen it twice but oh my god, it's sooo delicious! I think the other ones was the Bockwurst but it wasn't all that spicy (thankfully, for me).\n\nIf you want pancakes, you can choose from the weekly batter or the usual butter pancakes. They're very fluffy either way. I usually get the weekly batter...so far I've tried raspberry, blueberry, and banana. As someone who normally doesn't like pancakes and hates bananas, their banana pancakes are the bomb!\n\nAs for service, I would have to say 5/5. I'm not exactly introverted but I like to keep to myself and prefer to not make pointless conversation. After my first few initial visits, they recognized me and would let me be. My favorite staff is the shorter waitress. She always remembers to offer me a cup of hot water after I've been seated since I almost always ask for it. Little details like that really make the difference! One quieter, late afternoon, she noticed that I kept looking up at the specials menu and flipping the menu back and forth. She came up to me and asked if she could help. I told her that I couldn't decide between the daily special sausage or the weekly pancake to which she recommended the country style breakfast (consist of 1 egg, 2 short stacks pancake, and sausage).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-21", "description": "3.5 stars, but I've rounded up this time because I support family run operations such as this.\n\nIt's a cozy little diner nestled in the heart of the Glen Park business district on the corner of Diamond of Chenery.  The small space has tables parked fairly close together so the community inside can eat together and enjoy each other's conversations.  The spot is super popular too so a short wait outside is pretty common.\n\nI came in with four other friends I had just volunteered with at the nearby Glen Canyon Park where we pulled ivy, and dug up radishes, mustard and fennel on a steep, grassy slope.  A park staffer kiddingly noted that we were more effective than a herd of billy goats since we pulled up the unwanted plants with roots and all.  We were tired and hungry but enthusiastic about the work we had just accomplished, and the SF Recs and Park staff we worked alongside of highly recommended the restaurant for small groups.\n\nThe menu lists a nice assortment of breakfast dishes alongside burgers and sandwiches.  There is a daily specials board mounted behind the counter but many of the specials (not all) are already printed into the menu.  We all agreed breakfast for lunch (I guess some call it brunch.) would be the preferred choice.  Little glasses of ice water came around to the table.  It took a bit of time before the waiter came back to take our orders.  Very understandable considering how busy this place was.\n\nWhen the waiter returned I ordered an omelet with turkey sausage, mushroom, onion, avocado and jack cheese.  The omelets come with pan-fried house potatoes and choice of toast.  I had an iced tea to go with my water.  The turnaround time was very fast as we got our food in just a few minutes.  There were so many platters on our little table that we had to jostle everything around to get plates to fit.  My omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uymg9f_cBIprwMWOqzHGhQ?select=9w-Zgr0TKocW_tyRpGrNNw) was a nice size.  I'm thinking it was probably three eggs.  The generous portion of ingredients sat inside the pocket of the fried egg shell.  The turkey sausage are links cut up into bite sized pieces, and I'm happy to report they give you lots more of the good stuff (avocado) and less of the filler (onion); although, the onions were cooked up soft and I prefer that.  The thinly sliced potatoes were good with nice crispy edges.\n\nThe food was a tad on the greasy side, but none of us were complaining as we all ate everything on our plates.  The service is very friendly and very efficient.  In order to get to the small bathroom in the rear you need to go through the kitchen area to get there.  It was quite amazing watching two cooks prepare everything in such a small space.  The bathroom is decent too.  The water in the wash sink was very hot and perfect for scrubbing off all of the dried mud caked on our hands.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I ordered some oatmeal this morning and a fried egg. Egg should have been fried medium and instead the yolk was entirely uncooked. Oatmeal was bad. Clearly their instant oatmeal was stale. It had a bad \"off\" taste to it.\n\nOkay, this is not a huge deal to me, actually. I just didn't eat the oatmeal and dealt with the runny egg.\n\nBut when they came to clear my table and asked about the uneaten oatmeal, the fellow looked concerned, but not for me. Next the owner/waitress comes over and starts to argue with me that it's fresh and they make each batch as it's ordered--which I must say isn't that tough to do when dealing with instant. I reply that I'm not trying to argue. She says that no one's every complained and she's been there 30 years, to which I reply that there is a first for everything.\n\nAnd yes, I do end up paying nearly $5 for a bowl of uneaten, stale oatmeal that cost them maybe .50 cents.\n\nSo, like I said, I know this isn't a gourmet place and I'm fine with that.

Admittedly, I just came from running 1/2 of the SF marathon so any food would have been welcome, but an order of corned beef hash, eggs over easy and and two slices of sourdough was the ticket. \n\nThe wait staff is pretty busy running around trying to get everyone seated, ordered and eating as quickly as they can. \n\nThe two man cooking crew in the back is obviously busy pushing out orders and of course the two busy \"boys\" are just as frantic turn tables for the next group. \n\nThe corned beef hash was excellent. Definitely not from a can and I've been to my fair share of places where stuff is obviously from a can or an amalgamation of components from different cans. I regret not asking for it to be cooked a little longer, maybe a deeper char on the outside to get more crusty goodness. Oh well, no loss here. \n\nThe eggs oozed their yellow goodness over the top and with a squeeze of the Heinz ketchup (aka condiment ambrosia aka the condiment of the gods) and some crystal or Ashburn hot sauce and the meal is complete. \n\nIt actually hurt to eat, because of the run, but i inhaled that thing.... it is awesome... you have to get it.... but make sure you choose the right weekend as it is only every other weekend. \n\np.s. - they have an eggs benedict and a pumpkin pancake which also is awesome, even if you can't use condiment ambrosia on pancakes...or can you?", "author": "Andrew C."}

I found a tiny table by the window and sat down.  It took me a second to flag down the waitress/cashier/owner (?) but I didn't mind one bit.  It's not like she was sitting around filing her nails in the corner.  She was running around, bringing food, taking orders, cleaning tables and ringing customers up.\n\nWhile I waited for her to notice me, I had a chance to look around.

What the hell is \"quinoa?\"  Do I want it in my soup?  Wikipedia on the iPhone to the rescue . . .\n\nI ordered the basic diner breakfast fare: 2 pancakes, ham, scrambled eggs and a side of wheat toast.  Don't judge.  The pancakes came on a separate plate, and they were absolutely humongous.  They were very fluffy, although they seemed to have too much canola oil in them.  Either that, or the canola oil was extra pungent.  Eek.  The eggs were fresh and fluffy as well.  The slice of ham, although small, was delicious.  \n\nThe place is really old school: there is no sugar free syrup or Splenda.  If you care about things like that, bring your own.  The maple syrup is on the table before the pancakes, just like Rainman would have liked.  Serving it in old honey bear-shaped bottles is a nice touch.  The little packets of jam were on the table, too.\n\nWord of advice: drive 200 feet up Diamond Street and park for free.  There's no need to pay 25 cents for 7.5 minutes of parking at the meter, or whatever they charge you these days.

The staff here are so sweet and are always happy to see new people and the regulars. They make sure to greet you and make sure to let you know they'll be with you in a minute (if they haven't already seen to you!). Whenever people are in this neck of the woods and are hankering for some good ole' fashion American (well, Californian American) breakfast, I make sure to suggest Tyger's and try to get my friends to go there. \n    The ambiance is straight-up, no frills, tables-and-chairs. I've never been there when it hasn't been empty, so I usually eat with the chatter and the normal noises of families with small children, families with older grandparents, young people, old people, all types of people! I'm glad there is a place like Tyger's to show people that not all eating establishments in SF are full of hipsters, bougie techies/i-bankers, huppies (hippy+yuppie), faux-homeians (fake bohemians), and earth-mother breeders. You'll find that all are welcome at Tyger's and the staff will make sure that you feel that way.\n\n*The Food*:\nAgain, straight-up, good ole' fashion breakfast items. I agree with others that the coffee is a bit weak, but it'll do if you need your caffeine fix. I've had the pancakes, scrambles, omelettes, and the sides of bacon and hash browns. Seriously, the food hits-the-spot. For some, the food would just be a-ok...perhaps a step-up from Denny's/IHOP, but not as good as other SF breakfast establishments. As for me, I'm a 'Yay! I'm a fan' and give a 4-star rating because Tyger's fits the bill of a breakfast place that serves the kind of no-frills breakfast you remember growing up in your small suburban town (but, in my case, Tyger's is  way better since my suburban town was a hell-hole, and SF has fresher ingredients).   \n\n*Would I Eat Here Again?*:\nHell to the Yea. I can't get here as often as I like because I am not up early enough to eat breakfast. But like I said, if friends want to meet up to have breakfast in Glen Park, then I have no qualms in recommending Tyger's and secretly hope that we can decide on Tyger's as it's so convenient to get to (a block from Glen Park Bart Station), the great and welcoming staff, and the hits-the-spot kind of breakfast food.", "author": "Patricia S."}

I love the cheesy pictures of tigers, the never-changing menu, and the pictures of the Diamond/Chenery intersection years ago.\n\n     I live nearby, and I dive in here whenever I need to just relax and fill my stomach.  Many mornings I sit down, read a book, and eat a pile of bacon, mushrooms, and swiss cheese loosely wrapped in an omelette.  Sometimes the food seems bland, espescially with a taqueria like La Corneta right down the street, but there is a rack of boutique hot sauces under the register if you want some kick.  I'll probably keep dropping by, when I'm in a neighborhoody kind of mood, but a city like this one has a lot more to offer with a little bit of effort.\n\n     This is my first review, so tell me what you think.", "author": "Eric S."}

I live right up the street and my boyfriend & I ALWAYS go here for breakfast. The omelettes are amazingly good and I love the \"specials\" they have! I've been to other places that sell the same omlettes and no where can compare to Tygers. However I had to give it minus 1 star because service there COULD be better. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. When it's JAM-PACKED (and it does get like that OFTEN.. sometimes people wait in line outside the diner for 30+ mins!) and you want to order a \"TO-GO\" item.. the wait is FOREVER! I waited about 45 mins for my to-god! UGH.\n\n2. The ONLY GUY waiter there is NOT an example of good customer service. There was one time when my boyfriend & I ordered a omelette w/ potatoes.. the potatoes there ALWAYS taste RAW AND UNDERCOOKED so we asked to make them extra cooked/cripsy whatever on both of our orders and he said \"OK, ONLY ONE THOUGH BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME\" You just DO NOT say that to a customer.. that's RUDE!\n\n3. They have gotten my order wrong quite a few times. Once when I ordered a to-go burger for my mom. I wanted it EXTRA WELL DONE AND I EMPHASIZED NO RED AT ALL TO THEM & WHEN I GOT HOME IT WAS STILL RED. There was also another time when I ordered a omlette (TO-GO) and the omelette automatically comes with toast. I said I wanted english muffin and when I got home, the toast wasn't even there! Nowadays when I go there I just make shure that it's there before I go so I can catch them right then and there if something's wrong.\n\nRegardless of their wrongdoings I still don't let it stop me from going there because their food is A+! The great tasting food makes up for the not so good service. :)", "author": "Sarah E."}

Nice place, very reasonably priced. They do not accept credit cards as well... which is always a bit of a drag because honestly who carries cash with them now? But thankfully BoA and Wells Fargo ATMs are literally steps away, so it's not so bad.", "author": "John G."}

The service at Tyger's is amiable and efficient even in crowded situations. And yeah, the decor is a little behind the times, but not everyone has an inner interior designer or can afford to hire one.", "author": "Be N."}

Having seen the city go through so many transformations, and knowning that we are a foodie institution in the country, you gotta give it up to greasy spoon's like Tyger's that uphold some of the old school, traditional character of this city! Tyger's has that for me. Yes they have weird takes on California cuisine (chicken enchilada's and eggs, that is truly something I see my self eating while intoxicated or as a poor college student) the food is decent diner fare great pancakes, specials, the hash(!) and scrambles. It's truly disheartening to see people so against places like these, especially ones that didn't let the dot com bomb disrupt their flow.  To Tyger's!", "author": "Niki M."}

But Tyger's has the fluffiest egg omelets ever and the staff is friendly, prices are fine, and like some other reviewers have said it is just a great place to eat without being trendy, so overly self-conscious, and all that other frou-frou crap. Do not come here expecting a hip brunch with mimosas, it is just well done eggs, pancakes, sausage that kind of thing. And yes, parking is quite limited at Glen Park. It is very close to BART and there are several bus lines as well.", "author": "Empress C."}

We've been Sunday regulars for over a decade now, and when out-of-towners visit, they don't just come to see us or San Francisco -- they come to have breakfast at Tyger's.  A good-weather weekend means you may have to wait for a table, but it's never long and always worth it.

But the food is better quality, their sausage links are awesome and their burgers (yes I am still talking about breakfast) are mighty tasty. Also they have a surprising number of chalkboard specials, and I've never had a bad one.

Surprise of all ages though, there is vegan sausage on the menu! And it was delicious! Sometimes you just need to get out of the neighborhood, and Glen Park is great for imagining your alternative suburban lifestyle. What I like about the corner where Tyger's is located is how much is reminds me of a small Yorkshire town in England, apart from the lack of brick or cobblestone (and teenage moms) - a tiny cluster of shops and cafes in tiny buildings up and down a series of twisty hills, except with a gourmet health food store where 50% of the customers are yuppies, Russians, or both, a tapioca internet cafe and pleasant, nevermind tolerable, weather. The \"y\" in the name along with the greasy generic food and atmosphere of the place really brought me back to my days in the industrial North. Except the food is way better, and there's no way in hell you'd get vegetarian sausage OR fresh fruit in a place like this in Leeds or Sheffield, or even London for that matter. That said, it cost $10.50 for the said fruit and sausage plus some home fries. I can't in good food-loving conscience give it anything more than three stars because while it's not terrible, it's definitely not amazing, and clearly, they're just not looking to create the best food ever. It's the general mood of the place you're after here, a cozy, sweet, elderly, anachronistic trashy-yet-homey traditional cafe-diner, or in the words of the owners, a place with \"uniqueness and quasi-quaintness.\" (what?)", "author": "Jessalyn A."}

Tyger's is a standard ma and pa with a gum chewing waitress (actually no gum, but she does say \"Sweetie\" now and then), satisfying breakfast fare and really bad coffee. Reliable standards with heartland condiments (Kraft Mayo, ketchup, etc). The usual artery clogging brunch. It's great advantage is that it is neighborhood and unpretentious. Lots of kids, tables that can take larger parties and no reservations. No laptops, or not yet. You go there to eat. Sunday papers ok. Tuna melts and BLT's are just that: Tuna melts and BLT's. Decent pricing, nice old hippie owner and a counter with stools. You wouldn't have to drag me there with ten horses, but on the other hand, I wouldn't take a detour. There are a bunch of decent locations in Glen Park, and West Portal. Small groups only.", "author": "Otto S."}
