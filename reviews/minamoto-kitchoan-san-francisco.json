I have tried the jellies, and although I haven't tried the Baumkuchen here, I would say the reason I return to the store is for the Japanese confectionaries. \n\nI loved the ones with anko (red bean or white bean) paste because the sweetness is very delicate and unlike the confectionaries in general Japanese stores. There is no lasting bite attack of the overwhelming sweetness, so throughout start to finish, the treat is very pleasant and goes very well with green tea. \n\nThe fun part about visiting the store is that most of the confectionaries are seasonal, so every month there is something changed.", "author": "Mito I."}

I don't consume mochi with any regularity, beyond the occasional box of ice cream mochi from Trader Joe's. That said, sugar is good, and I think that's pretty universally understood. \n\nI stopped here at the suggestion of an old colleague I hadn't seen in months - I think he was picturing a little cafe, so we were both kind of surprised when we found what was basically a See's Candies full of beautifully wrapped little desserts and hilariously friendly ladies peddling them (literally, like picking one up and telling me how tasty it is). We bought a couple, and then ate them on a bench in the Wells Fargo bank nearby. It was a unique experience for me. Seating in the place would not go unappreciated.  \n\nI did a thorough, studious sweep of the store to understand the gist of it - pretty pricey boxes of beautiful candies/mochi-things, and individual ones that you can buy for a few bucks each. I poo-poo'd all of the ones that had chestnut (which was a good number of them), and grabbed a one-off of a Matcha-thing...it was like matcha goo wrapped in premium Nilla Wafer skin. It was great! Not looking to make it a habit of it, though. \n\nI also picked up a $16 box of Strawberry Mochi - 8 in the box, and they were definitely the softness, nicest mochi I've ever had in my life. They actually tasted like real, grown strawberries, not \"strawberry flavor.\" Pretty solid, and they doubled as a sweet gift for my +1. \n\nAll in all, I would eat more of these little things. They were really, really good, but definitely out of any price range I've ever considered for mochi. The Wells Fargo has beautiful architecture, if you're looking to make a day of it.

It's not like we have a sweet tooth or anything.  I saw the dollar signs adding on as I picked up more and more jelly-filled pastries, but at a certain point I threw all caution to the wind - an easy thing to do when there are freshly made desserts delivered directly from Japan.  In this case, less was not more.  More was more.  I needed more sweets, and oh - I got them!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I pounced out of Minamoto Kitchoan after being so graciously helped 15 minutes before closing the store; when arriving back at our hotel with the big bag of goodies they were immediately dumped onto the bed and torn into.  As I bought half the goods that were in the storefront, I won't even try to list each and every single one of them, but it is absolutely imperative that you know this: each one was as good as the next.  Some of the desserts tasted somewhat similar as many of the Japanese desserts are made with green tea, red bean paste and that fluffy pancake-like dough (if you can call it that).  Though there were similarities among the desserts, they each had their own distinct flavor as well.  The desserts were great, but make sure you have some water at hand as the desserts can dry you out pretty quickly do the paste-y texture of some.\n\nThe desserts were superbly fresh, but like I said - this is because they are flown in from Japan to be stocked on these very shelves.  Because the treats are flown in from Japan, these luxurious items are also somewhat expensive, hence how we walked out of Minamoto Kitchoan with $60 worth of sweets.  We'd have spent more had we caved to our own desires and gotten some of the box sets of sweets.  However, some of our self control was still withstanding and we decided to only proceed with buying individual sweets.  Most treats are available for individual purchase, but there are a few select ones that can only be bought in box sets/multiples.  My advice: get the individually wrapped/sold ones so you have more selection.  Like I said, more is more.\n\nI also loved this little place because of how pleasant the ladies behind the counter were.  We had arrived to the store about 15 minutes before closing and they were so kind and patient with us.  Besides this, the lady helping us was so cheerful - it only made me more excited to break out the sweets when I got back to the hotel room.

If you plan on coming here often (like I have found myself), sign up to become a member and collect points ($10 off for every $100 spent). \n\nI personally adore Japanese sweets. I find them to be quite artistic and so pleasing to look at. You can see the thought and patience and dedication that was put into each piece. Even the wrapping is neatly crafted and finely prepared. And that brings me to another point. The sweets here make lovely gifts. \n\nI've bought two gift sets so far from Minamoto each around $20. I got one that was Easter-themed and the other was a set of peach mochi. They gift wrap for you using quality paper with beautiful prints. The peach mochi were even individually wrapped inside the box. It brings to mind Roland Barthes' meditations on packages in Empire of Signs. \n\n\"It is as if, then, the box was the object of the gift, not what it contains...as if the package's function were not to protect in space but to postpone in time; it is in the envelope that the labor of the confection (of the making) seems to be invested...\" Although the individual packaging is charming, I do wonder if there can be a move to a more sustainable option. \n\nI came here recently for a tea ceremony demonstration. It was an intimate experience with a maximum of 3 participants for each session which was about 15 minutes. The demo took place right at the front of the store. We were each offered a sample of a selection of sweets to try. I chose the lime and lemon-flavored summer style bean jelly. \n\nThe bean jelly was exquisite and enchanting with jelly forms of a fish and maple leaves and whole red beans all captured within a block of jelly. It was rather sweet but turned out to be the perfect pairing with the bitterness of the deliciously smooth and rich matcha green tea that was individually prepared for us right before our eyes. \n\nAfter the demo, I bought a sakura mochi and took the time to eat and enjoy it in the store. There was a small bench available for sitting. One of the ladies was sweet enough to offer me a piece of folded paper to place the mochi on (it comes in a plastic container) when she saw that I was struggling a little to take a photo of the treat.  \n\nThe mochi was a delicious savory and sweet combination. The briny leaf and sweet and smooth red bean paste filling made a surprising but wonderful pairing. The leaf was so delicate and pretty you can see its veins and the dots lining its serrated edges. The pickled sakura flower had strong floral notes. As for texture, the gelatinous rice of the mochi was so soft and pleasant to chew.", "author": "Lauren H."}

Definitely a must-try!\n\nAyashirabe (white bean paste surrounded by cake) - the filling was different than what I've tasted before but was delicious; the cake layer was a bit thick for my personal taste.  \n\nKuri Daifuku (mochi with red bean paste and chestnut) - love how the chestnut added texture and more earthy flavors into the typical daifuku\n\nKinako Ohagi (mochi with red bean paste covered with roasted soybean powder) - I'm a huge fan of kinako (the powder) though some people might not like how it can feel like eating sawdust due to its dry texture.

You can't go wrong if you're looking for something really special and different. This is the only store in SF where you can buy high quality Japanese desserts. Here are their problems:\n\n1. No ability to leave feedback anywhere online which is why I have to leave it here in hopes that management sees this.\n\n2. The checkout process is way too slow. If there's a line of three or more people and all three people require some form of gift wrap, good luck getting out of there within 20mins. I know this sounds way too critical but they need to increase their staff especially over the holidays.\n\n3. Their frequent buyer program should be accessible via phone number and not email. Again, this is to speed up the checkout process.\n\n4. They check people out not by the order at the register but by when they walked into the store. If someone is in the store before you and they are shopping with a small basket, they get priority even though you walked in to get something behind the glass. How is this fair? Imagine if you're at a grocery store and they pulled someone ahead of you at the counter because they entered the store before you and all you wanted to do was buy a box of bubble water stacked against the front wall.\n\nGreat store but I hope they address these operations issues one day.", "author": "Kevin W."}

I love everything matcha and bake everything matcha. \n\nBesides a variety of Japanese desserts, they also have cakes, mochis & these unique jello cake things. \n\nSERVICE: \nWorkers are very friendly and professional.

Everything in this little shop with Japanese-style decoration is super cute and definitely does not disappoint in that aspect. The staff consisted of two really friendly Japanese women, giving the shop an even more authentic feeling. They only have a few store locations around the world and sell a wide range of mochi, peach jellies, some cakes, and other pastries and have really nice gift boxes.\n\nThe mochi are freshly made and are only good for a few days. Each of them is labeled with a good-by date. Everything looked super cute and I wanted to buy all of it! But.. I settled on 5 things to try this time: the pureed peach jelly and 4 different mochis. The pureed peach jelly, one of their popular items, was smooth and peachy and refreshing. They now also have another new kind of peach jelly! I didn't try the new one though. \n\nI chose 4 of the more interesting mochis - one had a chestnut in the center! The mochi itself was really soft and chewy and had a great texture, definitely high quality (none of that stuff that you buy in the refrigerated section of the supermarket). The fillings were tasty and not overwhelmingly sweet, so you could taste it in combination with the mochi and other flavors. One was covered with green tea crumbs on the outside (very different from the other plain mochi outer layers) = MUST GET!!!\n\nOh, and they have adorable displays in the cases!

Most people want to take a piece of Japan home. Well, the Kitchoan chain brings a piece of Japan to its various locations across the globe. \nIn 2009, this Minamoto Kitchoan opened its doors on Market Street. I did not have high hopes for their longevity, because it was such a tough time for most brick-and-mortar shops, and for the economy in general. What chance did premium-priced Asian confections stand when it seemed like the rest of the world was bottoming out? Well, I was wrong about that, like I am about most things. This Kitchoan has been on Market Street for a few years, but I finally entered their doors when I was looking for holiday gifts.\nI spent a great deal of time peering through their impeccably organized and display of gift boxes and gift sets. The space was very bright and immaculate. The ladies behind the counter were incredibly sweet, polite, and patient.\n\nKasutera/Castella - sponge cake:\nsuper moist. I got a couple of the honey (plain) and maccha flavored ones for gifts. \n\nBaumkuchen - German tree cake - uniform rings of cake - like the rings of a tree:\nvery moist, light, and soft, too\n \nAyashirabe - creamy white bean paste wrapped in very thin layer of cake:\ntastes like the white version of a moon cake\n\nMochi - Chocolate & Maccha:\nWe got a couple of individually wrapped mochi ones to try. They both had a doughy exterior. The mochi center was smooth and almost creamy as opposed to chewy and stringy compared to the frozen ones you find in grocery stores. \n\nI bought a couple of other boxes of mochi as gifts. They also had the same smooth consistency, which led me to think that I must not been eating very good mochi in the past.\n\nThey also offer complimentary gift-wrapping. Japanese are known for taking their packaging very seriously. I feel a slight twinge of sadness knowing it will all end up in the trash. It's hard not to appreciate the individually wrapped pieces in origami paper, wrapped in cellophane, wrapped in another gift bag, and tied with a ribbon. \n\nThe prices reflect the upscale look of the place. Most boxed items are about $25-$50 and the individually wrapped sweets are about $3-$5. But I have to be understanding of the cost to import these delicate confections, along with the labor of love to produce consistent quality and packaging for each bite.\nYou can order online from their website too, but their site has room for improvement.\nThere is also a frequent buyer card. They stamp your card for every $5 you spend. After 20 stamps, or after you spend $100, you can redeem a $5 reward. If you buy a few gift boxes here, it's very easy to reach that reward. \nNow I'm not an expert on Japanese sweets. So if I'm not purchasing a gift, I would probably stick to purchasing the inexpensive version of these products at local Asian grocers instead.", "author": "Joy W."}

We'll just have to wait and see, won't we?\n\nThey sell castella cakes (from Kyushu), white peach jellies and all kinds of other sugary delights.\n\nWorth noting:  They put some of their mochi up for sale at 50% off when it's a day old (i.e. you have to eat the sale mochi the day you buy it).\n\n\n---- MOCHI ----\n\nThe mochis cost between $3.00 - $3.60 each for a pretty large piece.  You can buy cheaper versions in the fridge section of Nijiya, but these at Minamoto are obviously freshly made and more expensive.\n\nMame Daifuku:  4.5 stars\nThe most traditional daifuku mochi, filled with red bean paste and firm whole beans that add bitable texture.  Not too sweet, tastes fresh and soft, slightly savoury with the earthy bean flavour.  Reminds me of the famous Mizuho mamedaifuku in Tokyo.\n\nKusa Mochi:  3.5 stars\nThe flattened crepe-like mochi is made with mugwort leaf and has a slight herbal, grassy flavour (hence the name \"Grass Mochi\").  The beans are in paste form so it's more \"smooth\" to the \"chunky\" texture of the Mamedaifuku.  This one will have to be more of an acquired taste for Westerners.\n\nKinkan Daifuku:  4.5 stars\nThis is a daifuku mochi filled with white bean paste instead of the usual red.  Absolutely delicious, and there's a whole candied kumquat in the centre too for a tangy kick.\n\n\n---- CAKES ----\n\nUsagi-san:  5 stars\n\"Yuzu flavored white bean paste wrapped in Japanese style steamed cake rabbit shape.\"  Tiny, delicate and tender cake casing, healthy-tasting and not too sweet, and the yuzu filling is absolutely delicious.

We've never heard about this place nor did we even take the time to look at the reviews. We both absolutely love Japanese food/desserts and seeing this fancy looking dessert shop definitely caught our attention. The prices are a little high, but TOTALLLLLY worth it. We actually stopped by here on both Saturday AND Sunday, and spent ~$50 in total. So, even if you plan on not spending much... think again. LOL. The people working in here have really great customer service  I'm a huge mochi lover, so little ol' me decided to get one of every flavor! The mochi they have here are really soft and loved the fact that their sweets aren't *too sweet*. I love sweets but hate the sugar rushes, if you know what I mean. Hahaha! I've tried multiple cherry blossom mochi before and this place by far has the best cherry blossom mochi I have ever had! It's a mix between sweet and salty, and the small bit of saltiness coming from the leaf makes it taste SO GOOD. You must also definitely try their ayashirabe!! As my husband describes it, it tastes like a \"better fig newton.\" It's so soft, smooth and rich in flavor (and it's one of the cheaper, \"bang for your buck,\" must-try desserts)!! We also tried their peach jelly, $16. It's really smooth and also worth a try. You can request to get a cold one too if you decided to eat it right then and there. ;)", "author": "Kaye T."}

The mochi was placed in glass cabinets and organized in a way where you would be able to find things easily. There was also a food model of what the mochi looks like inside for each mochi item. I picked out 3 mochi flavors - green tea, red beans, and white chocolate. My favorite was hands down the green tea! Definitely 5 stars! The green tea was authentic. There was a special green tea crunch on top of the mochi too. The red beans mochi was good as well. However, there were bits of red beans that were slightly hard. The strawberry mochi with white chocolate filling was my least favorite. I guess I am not used to having white chocolate as a filling for mochi. \n\nThe mochi wasn't too sweet. It was full of flavors. And most importantly, it was fresh. The balance of the mochi dough to the filling was perfect! Not too much dough and enough filling in each bite.

They were also called senju-senbei instead. I asked if the staff knew if they were similar to the originals in Japan and they said they thought they would be... They weren't :( their cookies were much harder and thicker with less sweetness. I barely salivated and began missing Japan more than ever. I wasn't satisfied and decided not to purchase anything else. I wish I hadn't wasted the $6 (I also bought the green tea version). \n\nThe store was pretty but my supreme disappointment has led me to this unimpressed review.

That freshness only lasts a day or two, so make sure to consume your goodies quickly!\n\nI came by on a recommendation from Jasmin, who had suggested it after reading my review on Benkyodo. I'd still prefer Benkyodo's mochi because it's freshly made every day (the mochi is softer and puttier hehe) and is more affordable, but I can definitely see the appeal of Minamoto.\n\nBecause the mochi are somewhat steep, I only bought two. The first was the KINKAN DAIFUKU, a mochi with a sweet white bean paste and a whole sweet kumquat, $3.00 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/minamoto-kitchoan-san-francisco?select=oUbbQs08bHl6thTkVpTalNg#oUbbQs08bHl6thTkVpTlNg). This was my favorite of the two because, for once, I found myself enjoying the creamy sweetness of the white bean paste over the more subtle, chunky red bean paste. Also, the sweet, dried kumquat in the middle is a pleasant kicker!\n\nThe second was the KURI DAIFUKU, a mochi filled with sweet red bean paste and a whole sweetened chestnut, $3.00 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/minamoto-kitchoan-san-francisco?select=oUbbQs08bHl6thTkVpTlNg#6gKm1BtcNYie1mqeUI25_w). The chunkier red bean paste is definitely subtler and more mellow in its sweetness than the white bean paste, with the soft chestnut in the center contributing even more to the low-key sugary tones of this mochi. I think the kuri showcases texture and subtlety, whereas the kinkan demonstrates a balanced sweetness and creaminess.\n\nI also snapped a few pictures of some of their selection (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/minamoto-kitchoan-san-francisco?select=oUbbQs08bHl6thTkVpTlNg#dleCKS1jZjUc3EyqAqbXRQ), though I only got a blurry picture of their Kusa Mochi (sweet red bean paste wrapped in a fresh mugwort (herb) mochi), $2.50.\n\nTheir KINKAN DAIFUKU was a treat, though I would choose Benkyodo's strawberry mochi over it any day :B", "author": "Adele F."}

Consider a 12 piece box cost $20 I was really expecting to taste a pop of the fruit flavor when I eat the mochi.\nThe store is beautiful.  Clean and bright.  The sweets are displayed as jewels in the glass cases.  The only way to know what each sweet tasted like is to buy a package and eat some.

If they would have the sweets that can be purchased in single pieces, then i think it would make it easier for customers to make product selection before making final purchase.\nThe ladies in the store were very nice and friendly.  When I asked for the white peach mochi the lady gave me the boxes that only has the best consumed date about 3 weeks to go.  I asked if there were boxes with a later date it went unanswered.

I was intrigued by the window display.  All of their desserts and mochi items looked so delicious!  \n\nI know for us Americans, we usually think of mochi as  glutinous rice cakes with ice cream filling.  Don't get me wrong because I absolutely LOVE that stuff.  However, I don't think the Japanese actually eat it that way.  When I was in the store, several patrons came in asking that same question: \"Do you have ice cream mochi?\"  Traditionally, the mochi is usually filled with red bean paste or green tea paste.  \n\nUpon entry, we were greeted by two lovely Japanese ladies who welcomed us in Japanese.  We browsed around the store for a bit because all of this was so foreign to me.  All the pieces were so visually appetizing that I wanted to try everything.  After much contemplation, I decided to I try the Momoaya and the Sakura Daifuku.  The Momoaya was simply exquisite!  It is Japanese white peach jelly, and it just tasted so refreshing and sweet.  I wish they made it in a bigger portion, but even that little size cost about $4.  The Sakura Daifuku is essentially a sakura flower's flavor within a mochi.. it was pretty good too, but definitely not as yummy as the Momoaya.\n\nI totally felt like I was in a small boutique shop in Japan.  It was artfully delicious.  However, I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the price.  You could easily spend $20 for only a few pieces of these sweets.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

They have stores all over the world in all major continents. Most Wagashi are quite different from the western style pastries. They come in many varieties. Some with seasonal fruits, some with bean paste, some are like daifuku and mochi with all kinds fillings. Honestly, some of those might be more of an acquired taste. If you never had Wagashi before, it is very important to carefully pick something you (or your lucky gift recipient) would like. They have very good description of what each Wagashi is made out of. Don't be afraid to read and browse slowly. You really can't judge what they are based on the look. Those ladies working in the store are all very courteous and not pushy at all so do take your time. \n\nI think in general bean paste based ones are not as appealing to people used to the sweeter western style desserts. The flavors are more delicate and the texture is drier. Daifuku with fruity fillings are always a safe choice. Most people love those including little kids. They also have some western style Wagashi but I have yet to try those.\n\nThese goodies aren't cheap and the shelf life is often rather short (a few days for most).

The products are quite pricey, but they've come a long way from Japan...so you know they're authentic!  The grand total was $55 with tax.

However when I purchased the mochi the cashier warned me that the mochi has a short shelf life and should be eaten ideally in the same day.

And the shop impeccably presents a broad variety of wagashi that reminds me of the omiyage my mom used to make me give to my relatives after temple on Sundays. But I am wondering if  the Ginza-gauging prices necessary to sell the wagashi makes this any more than a one-stop curiosity shop.\n\nI felt a need to support my sistuhs, so I bought four of the cheaper little treats (see photos). They reminded me of how hit-and-miss these sweets are for the uninitiated. I am not a manju freak by any shot as I usually can get through only half of one at Benkyodo unless it's the peanut butter manju. Those I like. Anyway, it was hard to decide which ones to get based on the packaging and the descriptions in kanji. I went for the Oribenishiki ($2.50), a bean cake with the imprint of the five-lobed compound leaf on its brown top (see photo). That apparently signifies that there is a combination of chestnut and dark red bean pastes inside. Meh.\n\nThe second was a white-bean jelly called Tsuyaguri ($1.60), a gelatinous bean cake filled with minced chestnuts. Another meh. The third was a mini-jelly cup of plum wine jelly with an actual plum in the middle, Kohakukanume ($4). It was rather sloppy to eat and yet again, meh. The last one I had was the Macchamanjyu ($2.80), a pale-green sugar-dusted rice cake filled with red bean paste with a chewy chestnut in the middle. OK, that was the best of the bunch, but it took me twelve bucks to get there.\n\nListen, I don't fault the staff for the lofty pricing. I have to believe it's expensive to import these things from the motherland, but the owners should really consider that we are in the middle of a recession in this country.

I've tried mochi from quite a few places, both here and in Asia, and I could tell that the quality of mochi here is superior than most. I especially loved my red bean mochi with chestnut inside. That's definitely hard to find. \n\nHave you guys read the book \"Predictably Irrational\" by Dan Ariely?  There is a segment in it that resonated with me when it comes to pricey food item. In the book, Dan compares generic white t-shirts to designer versions. He asks, \"The designer t-shirt costs five times as much as the generic, but is it five times better?\" This might be me going off on a tangent, but it helps me keep my food opinions in perspective. This mochi is two to three times more expensive than Benkyodo in Japantown, so is it twice or three times as good? It depends, in my opinion. I think the treats at Minamoto Kitchoan would make for a lovely hostess gift or birthday gift for someone who appreciates the unconventional. The packaging was gorgeous and the little cakes and mochis had unique flavor combinations. If that's the sort of thing you or your recipient will appreciate, then yes, do try the offerings here. If you're buying for a mochi newbie or someone who wouldn't appreciate the packaging or delicate flavors, then maybe consider something else.\n\nAnd in case this encourages anyone, they do offer stamp cards for repeat customers.", "author": "Jenn C."}

Sadly Minamoto Kitchoan is a bit more mundane than the finest wagashi you can find in Japan.  \n\nThe mochi is very good, but it didn't seem as fresh and natural as I had hoped.  I guess it is because they are air-flown from Japan, so they have to survive a lot longer than normal wagashi would.  I was disappointed to find that many of the items had artificial coloring added.  Avoiding all the artificially colored or wheat or milk containing mochi and jellies, there were four choices left.  Black sesame covered mochi, kinako covered mochi, a sakura mochi on a leaf, and a tiny yokan.  All were excellent.  In case you are looking for vegan and gluten free sweets, these four are all vegan and gluten free.  You can easily figure this out because each mochi is well labeled in English.  Update: later I discovered inconspicuously in the back of the shop an azuki bean rice cracker sandwich that is gluten free, vegan, and all natural which I highly recommend\n\nHaving grown up eating super fresh mochi and also having some high quality wagashi and mochi in Japan, there are definitely levels above Minamoto Kitchoan possible.  I was hoping Minamoto Kitchoan would deliver that super fresh wagashi experience, but I suppose for a chain trying to operate across the world, they are pretty good.  It's definitely a very Japanese experience, right down to the excessive packaging, paying by passing back and forth a little tray, and the Japanese ladies behind the counter who didn't understand the word \"utensil\", allowing me to exercise my Japanese skills.  \n\nThey have some very nicely packaged tea available which would make a nice hostess gift along with a few mochi or a yokan.  (If you are unfamiliar with Japanese culture, Japanese are all about gifts, small and large, which is probably part of why excessive packaging is so popular)\n\nOverall worth a visit, it's all very good and a cut above most, but for the best wagashi I think you're still going to have to visit Japan or keep looking.\n\nThe best description I can think of is that this is like a shop you would see in Japan for foreign tourists, it's a very mainstream citified version of what I was hoping to find.", "author": "N T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-13", "description": "Real authentic Japanese sweets?  Of course, items are all made in Japan and shipped to the U.S.  \n\nI had to think really hard about how to review this place.  Should I review at the standard of compared to other Japanese dessert places in Tokyo which I frequent often these days?  Or should it be compared with Benkyodo Co.(http://www.yelp.com/biz/benkyodo-co-san-francisco), a local San Francisco establishment?\n\nVS. Benkyodo:  Quite different.  \nBenkyodo is a local shop making Japanese mochi using California rice and red bean pastes using American sugar.  Kichoan uses Japanese ingredients (well, there is always a possibility that they use imported beans from China, but I do not know).  The biggest difference is that Kitchoan products are FROZEN once.  Benkyodo products are fresh and never frozen (i hope).  Kichoan makes their products in a massive factory on an assembly line.  Benkyodo's assembly line consists of grandpa, dad, mom, and angry teenager (just imagining).  Taste wise, Benkyodo is more traditional style, quite rough and old fashioned, unaffected by the changing taste bud of Japan.  Kitchoan taste is more refined and reflects the current trend in Japan, suppressing the sugary sweetness.  When comparing the establishment date,  Benkyodo born in 1906 is much older than Kichoan born in 1947.   Knowing the personally of local loving San Francisco community, people should support Benkyodo over Kitchoan.  \n\nVS. Japanese standard:  Kitchoan is one of the big guys with over 100 stores in Japan (most of them inside department stores).  Do not rave about Kitchoan to Wagashi Otaku (Japanese sweets fanatics) because they do not take these kind of huge production establishments seriously.  Otaku argues that these big guys use techniques that enable products to last over a week at room temperature, which sacrifices taste.  Big guys has to worry about transit time from factory to shops where as smaller establishments sometimes sell items with ONE DAY expiration date!  For example, my favorite Dorayaki shop in Japan is \"Usagiya\" (http://www.tctv.ne.jp/usagiya/) established in 1913, tell you that their dorayaki only tastes good the day it is purchased with expiration date of next day.  \n\nPRICE:  \n$3.00 Tsuya (dorayaki)\n$2.80 Mame Daifuku\nDorayaki in Tokyo is about 180 Yen, which is about $2.  Thinking about their trouble of shipping the items to the U.S. and going through the delicate defrosting process, the price is not so bad.\n\nCONCLUSION:  Defrosted taste did not bother me too much.  They must use a very good technique.  Having an option to buy authentic Japanese sweets in SF is awesome, so addition of Kitchoan in the city should be appreciated, although I do not think it replaces Benkyodo.  I personally think that Benkyodo continues to be a unique SF treasure.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Anything you buy at this store meets the contemporary upscale Japanese standards 100%. No shit. \n\nMy fellow Japanese residents bitch about them and say all items are pricey. I think they're crazy. It is incredible that you have anything to buy at this business under 5 dollars because Minamoto Kichoan is the Rolls Royce of Wagashi outside Japan.  \n\nThere's something in the world in which people can never beat Japanese within a century of two.

It's similar to Nippon Ya in Japantown, with fancy treats ready for gift giving and plastic food models, but the selection differs.  Minamoto Kitchoan has a smaller selection, one that emphasizes mochi, jellies, crackers and cookies.  While some items are available in box sets only, including the adorable rabbit cakes, many of the treats can be purchased individually for about $2 - 4 a piece.  Minamoto has a more upscale feel with some items in glass cases, reminiscent of a jewelry store.  Your payment is accepted on a tray and the change and receipt are returned on a tray.  The shopping bag seems to come from Japan (it has Japanese on it).  They play Japanese music in the store. \n\n* Fukuwatashi Senbei ($2.50): So good.  It's a cookie sandwich that looks like an extra thick ridged yellow potato chips with a thin layer of vanilla cream in the middle.  The cookies are very crunchy and taste a bit like fortune cookies only better.  The cream was also very good.  Highly recommended.\n\n* Kuri Daifuku ($3): This was a red bean mochi with a whole chestnut in the center.  The mochi was a light green.  The paste was a bit chunky.  The chestnut was soft and very sweet.  Nice flavors but probably not worth $3.  \n\n* Kusamochi ($2.50): This was a flat, moon shaped sticky green mochi pancake with red bean inside.  The green came from the mugwort which didn't have a strong flavor.  The mochi part was stickier and softer than usual.  Good but not that different from other red bean mochi.  \n\n* Kazekaoru ($4): A seasonal treat, very pretty.  The exterior was a spongy light pancake and inside it had red bean paste with a chewy strip of mochi.

All the cakes were good, but they're not unique as I can easily go to a nice Chinese bakery (i.e. Keewah) and buy something similar for about 2/3 the price and about 3 times the size.  \n\nWhat they're selling here is the Japanese experience - the distinctly Japanese decor & presentation, beautiful packaging and great service.

Later that evening it was very difficult to pick just one that stood out amongst the others - we loved them all. None too sweet and all very unique and satisfying. We will definitely be making a trip back here the next time we are in San Fran.", "author": "Laura R."}

I always look in through their front window, but only recently decided to actually go inside. \n\nAt first glance, you'll notice how adorable everything is. From the mochis themselves to the packaging, everything was well thought out and put together. You will then look at the prices and think \"Wow, this place is expensive AF.\" A little mochi a bit bigger than a quarter will run around $4 and a little cracker with chocolate filling is about the same price. For ONE! Want a mochi that's the same size of your fist? $30+. But hey, I was already here so I thought I might as well. I looked around and picked up two mochis, a green tea mochi with white chocolate filling, and a white peach flavored sweet bean cake. I was actually unaware that the white peach one was a bean cake until I opened it, and I personally wasn't a fan of the texture, but I really enjoyed the flavor of it. However, the green tea chocolate one was delicious. Texture was soft and chewy and the white chocolate filling was SO good. \n\nI was actually hoping to not like what I purchased because of the price. I can definitely say that the mochis were good, but the big question is whether or not it's actually worth $4 just for one tiny piece. The jury's still out on that part, but I would still recommend this place to try if you haven't already.", "author": "Kari G."}

What was once sushi and teppanyaki being the extent of my knowledge has spread to ramen, ozakaya, yakitori, kaiseki, yakiniku, and a fair number of other preparations Im not recalling off the top of my head right now. Who knew that something like okonomiyaki, buta kaknuni, or the differences between Kyoto and Hiroshima style cooking would lead me down so many culinary paths? \n\nWell add one more notch to the journey, the world of Japanese desserts. Ive had my fare number of treats from the various Japanese markets and restaurants but Minamoto has gone to the extent of serving the specific Japanese tea ceremony style confections. I want to believe that this is the same chain that is in NYC, London, Singapore (http://www.kitchoan.com) but it's not indicated on their somewhat fragmented website. Been told you can find some Minamoto items at the Mitsuwa marketplace but I'll have to verify for myself.\n\nEverything is exquisitely packaged and the attention to detail (so Japanese!) is phenomenal. My fruit jelly was put together almost in an origami style fold and had a puzzle like quality. The texture, the taste, look were all subtle as most Japanese food is. Not for the faint of heart as these items are pricey, but one must understand the craftsmanship and attention to detail that is put into these to really appreciate them to accept the price tag.

It's definitely not your conventional sweet dessert, but texturally it's divine.\n\nNowadays, Mochi is pretty much everywhere, one iteration that is very popular is the Mochi Ice Cream (ice cream filled Mochi in various flavors) which is popular in Japanese restaurants.\n\nHowever, for the real thing, you have to go and buy from an authentic Japanese confection shop; so when we're in SF, Minamoto Kitchoan is a destination must that should not be missed...\n\nYou immediately get a sense of Japanese culture once you enter the store; like entering a pristine showroom, only with sweets on display instead of cars.....candy cars....anyways....\n\nThe interior is modern minimalism, clean but warm with distinctly Japanese touches.  The displays are incredibly elegant, each piece is shown like a piece of artwork, elevating them to a higher level. (if you could taste with your eyes, it would be heaven!)\n\nMinamoto Kitchoan has all types of sweet and not all of them are the same: you have Mochi in it's plural iterations, Jellies and Custards, sugar candies, Castella (Portuguese Honey Cakes), and then there's something called Yokan- a Red Bean Jello/Agar brick block that is utterly horrendous, (my opinion)....I wouldn't get that....\n\nWe have two favorites at this shop; they embody the best of both worlds.  It's a hybrid between the West and the East: Chocolate Mochi!!!\n\nThere are two different types: the Dark Chocolate Mochi has Powdered chocolate covered MOchi with a creamy chocolate center.  The quality of chocolate combined with the soft elastic texture of the MOchi provides the perfect meld between both worlds... There's six to a box, so it's a precious confection- we savor every bite\n\nThe other Mochi we get is the Green Tea White Chocolate-super heavenly delicious: Powdered Green Tea covered Mochi with White Chocolate Filling.  I love how the White Chocolate works so well with Green Tea, it's culinary evolution!\n\n Minamoto Kitchoan has stores all over the Country: LA, NY as well as all over the world (Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong and of Course, Tokyo).\n\nIf you're ever in the mood for some authentic and innovative Japanese sweets, Minamoto Kitchoan is a must, especially if you're a cultural enthusiast!", "author": "Alan M."}

In case this has not been made clear, none of the items in stock are made in-store, which I consider one prerequisite to a place being deemed a bakery (and ohhhh do I love bakeries from all over the world).  Rather, everything is imported from Japan.  \n\nThat's right, preservative packed snacks shipped to San Francisco.  The kasutera cake may be airy and yummy; the jellies might have a high variety, and the mochi may contain more variations of red bean paste than you ever imagined possible, but still.  This is no better than what your friends bring back after a trip in Japan, or what you could order online?  \n\nThe shopaholic in me wanted so badly to purchase something from this highly rated shop, but alas, I could find nothing at Minamoto's that would tempt my easily sold palette.

Yes it is a bit pricy but it is also authentic japanese sweet from japan. All the items are priced with a 'best by' date and each look really yummy. So far my favorite is Kuri Daifuku (Rice Cake, $3.00 each). I love chestnut and it satisfied my appetite since theres a whole chestnut inside the red bean paste and mochi. This time around, I bought Kasuteira (Green Tea Sponge Cake, $13.00) Maccha Manjyu ( Bean Cake, $2.20 each), Cheese Busse (Sponge Cake, $3.50), Tenkataihei (Fish Shaped Bean Cake, $3.00 each), and Daikitchoimo (Sweet Potato Cake, $ 4.00 each). The total came out to $25.70. They dont charge tax. They take cash or credit/debit card (Visa, Mastercard, Discovery). The people are always friendly and eager to help. The store is bright and welcoming. I will come here again when I want some japanese sweets and have some cash, haha.\n\n* Now I can add Tenkataihei and Kasuteira to my favorites. The Tenkataihei is yummy, the outside was a thin cake layer that looks like a fish and inside is sweet red bean paste with whole red beans. The Kasuteira is basically a sweet green tea cake that tastes wonderful with tea. The tea part tastes like matcha green tea and it is very yummy.", "author": "Jen M."}

It's made of smoothly ground kidney beans, sweetened and then wrapped in a firm cake.\n-Kuri Daifuku ($3): Kuri = chestnut which is my favorite. This one is a mochi outside filled with sweet red bean paste wrapped around a chestnut center. The mochi was beautifully light and delicate but with a nice chew. Mmmm. \n-Ohagi Kurogoma ($2.50): Ground black seasame fills the center of this mochi ball. I love the flavor of the black sesame. It's good for you too I hear. But beware that it may leave some unpleasant seeds in your teeth. \n\nNote, many items are frozen given the imported nature of shipment. So some need an hour of thawing. The store clerks will instruct you. \n\nPrices vary from about $2.50  - $3.50, at least for the ones I chose. Great as a gift and for tea time.

Was on our way to the gallery opening event downtown last night when I was surprised to see a store with Japanese sweets.  When did this get here...I thought this used to be a See's Candy store at one time.\n\nAnyway, the reason I'm jokingly writing about irra-shai-mase here is because when you walk into a traditional store or business in Japan, you usually get a warm greeting.  I realize they were helping somebody, but I didn't get such a greeting or the warm and fuzzies during the time that we were in there.  We were actually ignored.  Very odd.\n\nRegardless, I loved their variety and the presentation of the sweets in their display cases was downright perfect.  Although a box of these confections can get pricey (nothing compared to what I've seen on business trips to Japan), the cost per piece was appealingly reasonable.  A lot of exciting, delicious choices were available for only $2.50.  \n\nWill definitely have to go back although I do wonder if this is the ideal location for them to open such a store.  No parking at all and away from the downtown shoppers.  I think they would have done better opening up closer to Westfield Center since the higher rent would have been offset by the much greater foot traffic.  The Ferry Building would have been an awesome place.  Heck, even Embarcadero Center or the Marina would have been a better choice to open such a store in my opinion.", "author": "Roy N."}

Filled with beautiful wagashi (Japanese confectionaries), that make her nostalgic for her time spent in Japan and Taiwan. She grew up snacking on these kawaii sweets. The women who work there are extremely gracious, and all the displays are like artwork - you can spend a good half hour just ogling the cases. \n\nSo today, I stopped into the new shop in SF, and picked out a basket full of these adorably packaged sweets that I knew she loved, which included Tsuya (sweet red beans sandwiched between sweet mini pancakes), Oribenishiki (chestnut and sweet red bean paste wrapped in Japanese cake), Fukuwatashi-Senbei (vanilla cream filled cookie), and flavored jellies like bihu and muscat. The very sweet lady who helped me managed to arrange them perfectly into a box - after three different box sizes and various configurations to get it right. She then wrapped it in beautiful Japanese paper. Although they have pre-packaged gift sets, I thought it would be more special to custom make one with items I knew she liked. Plus, these snacks are quite spendy, so you want to make sure who ever is eating them will like every piece. \n\nI'm going to give her the box later this evening when I take her out to dinner, but I'm pretty sure she's going to love them.

Even in Japantown and the Inner Richmond. \n\nThough the prices may seem high, it's not much more expensive than what a shop in a Seibu department store or a place off of Sanjo-dori in Kyoto would charge.  I'm very pleased with my Usagi (dough bunny rabbits filled with a slightly sweet bean paste,) and a box of ten only cost $20. They would cost $16 at one of the aforementioned stores. Not including cost of plane ticket.\n\nOh God who am I kidding. I'm just glad I was able to use my Japanese here without the staff looking at me like \"Great, another one of these dorks.\" They were surprised,  laughed and seemed to enjoy it.

I told her I'd be eating it within the hour, so she grabbed me a chilled one from the back (it's better served cold).\n\nThe only negative thing I can think of is that the FDA is required to screen each and every package that they import.

This happened during my visit, but that's okay because there was plenty more to enjoy.\n\nThe prices may seem high to some, but I find them to be reasonable for the most part.

The staff are Japanese, they speaks Japanese and their service is also like what you may experience when you are shopping in Japan. Staff are super polite, soft spoken and very patient when it comes to helping with selection and packaging.  \n\nI bought 4 pieces of sweets of the season to sample. I tried 1 kind of sweet in every category: mochi, jelly and wafer.  \n\nThe mochi with a whole chestnut and sweet red bean paste wrapped with lightly green mochi was the winner for me. Then a yuzu (Japanese pamelo) jelly was very dense and a little too sweet for my taste, but still tasty and the scent of fresh yuzu is apparent in this little dessert. I also got a piece of Fukuwatashi Senbei (vanilla cream between two wafers), which was just ok. I had hope the wafers to be little more flaky, but it was more cripy and the cream was mediocare.  \n\nOverall, a good find in SF downtown area and a good place to go when I need to shop for authentic and traditional Japanese sweets for my Japanese friends. Prices are a little on the higher side, average price per piece $2.50 although some specialty and seasonal items costs a little more. But given these are hand made sweets flown in from Japan, you have to throw in a little more for the sky soaring gas prices.

We decided to get the green bean mochi and a peach jelly. \n\nI must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. I wish we bought more. The mochi was very smooth and creamy. The jelly was sweet and potent. Yummm. :) Wish I could buy more right now!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

To be honest, I don't have the wildest sweet tooth, so the sensible Japanese know just how to treat the likes of this dullard. Lots of absurdly (yet spartanly dressed) bits goodies... jellies, mochis, cakes, and all kinds of other tasty thingies. It really feels like every old, Japanese woman's purse I've ever rummaged through in my whole life. I'm sure it's my imagination but the place just triggers my olfactory to smell Shiseido. A little pricey, but I'm not opposed to paying for a little something from them if I'm in the mood to gift someone something somewhat sweet. Otherwise, Specialty cookies it is...", "author": "Roy M."}

I was on my way to Sutter Station aka Shitter Station aka Sutter Gutter (don't ask) when I stumbled upon this immaculate and shiny Japanese candy shop. Only a week away from Christmas, my mind was scrambling for gift ideas. What does my brother love? FOOD! Where is one of his favorite vacation spots? JAPAN! No brainer. The store was already set up for the desperate holiday shopper with various assortments scattered across the counters. You could select one of their pre-made assortments or customize your own. The trick was finding items that stayed fresh long enough for my trip home. The staff was great and walked me through all my options. In 15 minutes, I was out of there with 2 boxes of assorted goodies, nicely wrapped and ready for travel!", "author": "Susan L."}

It's got that sterility of a japanese omiyage gift shop, with all the snacks individually sealed and packaged, combined with the warmth of seeing some of my favorite japanese sweet cakes.  they have at least 3 different types of mochi, including a little dumpling-shaped one that I've never had, called kusa-mochi (green tea mochi wrapper folded in half over red bean paste that's not too sweet), a standard red bean stuffed mochi, and a chestnut paste mochi.  they have the classic tsuyu, red bean \"sandwich\" between two sweet pancakes.  they even have a creme-filled senbei-sandwich cookie, and a bunch of little usagi (rabbit) cakes that i have yet to try (they didn't have any samples at the time, and it was $20 for a box).\n\nThey even take your money/credit card on the little tray with the rubber bumps like in japan, and give you your change/receipt on the same tray.  And the two people in the shop were both japanese.\n\nCompleting the teleportation of japan, the cakes were about what you'd pay in japan as well...  the mochi/tsuyu/senbei were $2-$3 each (yeah... about the price of a double-double).  yep.  pricey.  but tasty.  and seriously it's like a little oasis of japanese customer service and cute little individually wrapped japanese snacks.", "author": "Fong L."}

As much as I would like to buy the sweets for myself, everything is so nicely sculpted and packaged that they almost demand to be given exclusively as gifts.\n\nThe staff are super nice and can arrange any combination of sweets into a wonderfully wrapped gift box for a modest charge. Some of the jellies are available chilled if you'd like to eat them right away. Cold bottled teas can also be purchased at the register.\n\nThe shelf life of these sweets is very short, so you'll want to eat or gift them right away. Make sure to check the expiration dates.\n\nThe few chestnut, mochi, peach and yuzu goodies that I've splurged on were good. The seasonal persimmon treat was especially good. If only there were an adjoining tea room where you could enjoy the sweets with a hot cup of green tea. (I remember a shop in Kyoto that did something like that.)

Walking thru the store brought back child-like wonderment that I had seeming lost after years of consuming overpriced domestic goodies! Ahh sweet confections loosen thy grip on my wallet and self control! \nThis place is spendy, but worth every penny. It's always fun to splurge on a taste of real Japanese sweets made in Japan as long as you don't think too deeply about the cost benefits of shipping it all the way around the world. \nI'd say try the seasonal items as they are the most unique and seemingly exotic. I like bang for my buck! Like a trip to Japan without the jetlag! \nThe Fukuwatashi Senbei $2.50 was yummy. Remincent of a sugary waffle cone sandwich cookie. \nKazekaoru - I think that was $3.00. Fan! It was a light and airy crepe with red bean. I heart red bean anything! \nKurimanju and the Hakuun-no hotori - I think that they were both $3.00 too. My faves! The first was buttery and had intense honey and chestnut flavor with a creamy white bean filling and the latter had just the creamy sweet white bean wrapped in a crepe. \nI'm not a fan of anything jelly, so that knocks out a huge portion of the treats for me. Boo. Its a texture thing! \nI think this store provides a fun and unique nichey product that is worth a try, but I can't say that I'd go back there again unless someone else was buying!", "author": "Stacy T."}

Step right up, because once you've entered this charming storefront on Market you are gar-run-teed a 15 min Japanese vacation.  I went here to buy a Christmas present for a gluten free friend who loves Japanese candy.  The sales lady was sweet and helpful (double checking all the ingredients, just to be safe) and made a beautiful assortment.  Very high end imported candy that has an expiration date, but everything is such a treasure, encased in its own unique wrapping.  Gift wrapping is recommended if it's the case that you're giving.  Now I'm jealous of my friend, who will get to peel away the layers of beautiful printed papers, and find some exotic treat.
