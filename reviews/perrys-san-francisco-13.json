Is their food out of this world? No. Is it good and convenient? Yes. I come here often on Thursday nights for half price bottles of wine- they are one of the only\nPlaces in SF that does this and they have a pretty great wine list. They have four tables outside that are dog friendly and have amazing people watching. Part of me hates saying that because I don't want more people to take my table on Thursday nights! \n\nMust haves: buffalo tenders w/ ranch, Cobb salad with buffalo sauce on the side (I promise it's good), sweet potato fries and the chili. \n\nI'm only docking them from their five stars because service is totally hit or miss. Some nights I have amazing service, and some nights it's incredibly slow. Also their Sunday brunch is just okay- and the service is never good then, so don't be in any hurry when you're there. \n\nThe entire month of August 2018 they have half price bottles of wine to celebrate their anniversary!", "author": "Morgan J."}

There are also plenty of tables along the side, and there are also two rooms in the rear that can be used as extra dining space or for private functions.\n\nThe food is typical pub fare - salads, sandwiches, burgers, and modest entrees - but the serving sizes and overall quality are quite decent for what you're paying. There's also an extensive selection of boozy items, whether a nicely curated wine list, a fair amount of craft beers, or any number of cocktails.\n\nService is friendly, fast, and professional here, and this is a perfect spot for unpretentious groups large and small.

The cooks really seem to know what they're doing as well because the pot roast I had was amazing, not a dry bite I the whole dish, the mashed potatoes were extra fluffy and flavorful and the broccoli had a flavor all it's open.\nThe issues I have with this place are that the cooks are clearly under utilized by such a lackluster menu that rivals that of the most common restaurant available. The portions appear small for the price. I felt that 20$ a dish for these portions were not appropriate.\nAll in all, it's a decent place to eat but for the price and with the menu options and it feeling a bit cramped for the seating, it loses some points there that could've made this place a 5/5 if they utilized the wait staff and cooks to their dull potential.", "author": "Anthony S."}

One ordered a Grilled BLTA and another shared an order of Buffalo Wings. I had the salmon and it was delicious! The salmon was tender and sat on a bed of quinoa with pesto sauce. I believe everyone enjoyed their food! I also had a glass of the rose and they complimented each other well. \n\nI'm pleasantly surprised by this place as it felt a bit touristy.

It comes with delicious sides and it's just perfect. I would give five stars just for that. But today I decided to try some of their other menu items and I'm super bummed because they are garbage. The buffalo tenders are somehow soggy and tough at the same time. Sauce is not flavorful, it's just hot. I've only eaten three and twice I've bitten down on something crunchy or hard that I had to spit out, it's full of cartilage and tendons. Clean your chicken properly, dang. These buffalo tenders are so bad I couldn't even finish them. More than half just went in the trash. The mac and cheese was edible but underwhelming. Needs seasoning, and aside from a sprinkling of breadcrumbs on top, it's basically indistinguishable from the frozen kind. So, only three stars.

To start, the breadsticks were quite stale and the iced tea was watered down. I started with a mixed green salad and asked for the extra blue cheese dressing. The greens were somewhat limp and the salad dressing was so thinly applied you could barely taste the blue cheese. For entrees we ordered straightforward dishes, penne pasta and a hamburger. But 30 min after we finished the salad the entrees were not delivered. Meanwhile two other groups in the back dining room,  parties of 3 and 4 people who arrived after us, were enjoying their entrees while we waited and waited.

I never yelp but felt obligated to since I read other reviews about this particular bartender. The fact that we could see and hear her displeased manner is so unprofessional. I hope that someone speaks with her about her attitude since this isn't the first time someone has complained. \n\n***Although I appreciate your quick response, Margie, I've read through the other reviews and see that this happens more often than not with this particular bartender. As a bartender myself, her attitude and demeanor are unacceptable in such a tight knit industry.", "author": "Nicole S."}

Cow hollow comes yuppie as hell most of the time, getting waaaaayyyy to clever with the brunch menus. Perry's keeps it real. They can get fancy if you want to get fancy, but if you want an omelette, or even a burger, they've got you. Let's be honest, you're at brunch because you're too hungover to live. I appreciate not having to google the ingredients.\n\nAtmosphere was real cool, they have a covered patio thing in the back that was beautiful and let a ton of light in. It was busy, like any brunch spot on a sunday, but we got seated for 2 with no reservation, which was nice.\n\nOmelette with homefries and burger with house made potato chips all came absolutely correct. Not a single complaint.

Ordered a simple spaghetti entree and received a huge portion, enough to feed 2 people. The meatballs were really huge and cooked very evenly; they did a great job of absorbing all the sauce and remaining very juicy. They were generous with my side order of fries as well, but the fries were bland, thick cut, and soggy, which I wasn't a huge fan of. The service was pretty average, and there was a constant throng of business people who were eating nice business casual lunches there, so I understand the lag.\n\nWeekend breakfast 2/5:\nI came with my boyfriend and we opted to eat outside at the last outdoor table available because it was great weather. There was a set weekend menu that featured brunch items, none of which were fully breakfast-y or lunch-y, but just a hodge podge of whatever seemed quick and easy to prepare without having to heavily burden the cooking or serving staff. Since brunch places are pretty competitive in San Francisco, I was expecting a much more diverse menu, especially for the price point. After a long deliberation picking between entrees I wasn't really interested in, I halfheartedly ordered the Monterey Scramble which consisted of egg whites with saut\u00e9ed spinach, shiitake mushrooms & tomatoes.  All the ingredients were soggy and watery.  Together, it was like a pile of mush with no definition to any of the flavors of the ingredients, salt, pepper, nothing could save it. My boyfriends eggs Benedict was a bit more flavorful, but by no means memorable. The hollandaise sauce was pretty plasticky in texture and the biscuit was dry if not almost stale. I was really disappointed to see such a limited brunch/weekend menu considering how diverse and extensive their lunch menu is during the week. \n\nWill I come back? No, blerrrrgghhhh. The food was lacking taste and the proper food texture. The only plus was the portion size, but I had no desire to consume big portions of underwhelming food. Good American food is not hard to come by in San Francisco so this really just didn't meet expectations for what I thought should have been a simple brunch and lunch meal.", "author": "Kathy T."}

After talking up the location to my friend visiting from Sacramento area, we headed to the Union Street location, my favorite of the three. When contacting the two young hostesses at the podium and requesting an outside table, (one of which was unoccupied and set), we were told that they would need to hold the available table for a reservation which was scheduled for over 15 minutes from the current time, despite there being other tables outside which appeared to be finishing their meals soon and likely departing at or close to the future reservation. Initially accepting this, I noted a table inside by a window also open and set, and requested this table. After a brief moment of consideration the hostesses again told us that they would need to hold that table for another reservation which was also over 15 minutes away. After being seated at a different location I noted at least two tables which were in the process of paying their tabs at the windows while the first remained open.  When I expressed to the hostesses that I felt it was in poor form to hold multiple tables for reservations so far out while others were clearly coming available and customers are present ready to be seated with requests for those tables, I was met with an argumentative and rude response to the effect of I just don't know how their job works. After both young ladies became agitated and argumentative, I informed them that I was not willing to participate in an argument over the issue and would instead discuss my concerns with a manager at a later date, to which one continued to attempt to engage me in a dispute while the other responded with \"that's fine, go ahead and talk to a manager, we can too.\"   While this was frustrating enough, being glared and scowled at while trying to enjoy our meal made for an extremely unpleasant experience. \n\nThe condescending attitude, hostile and immature demeanor and obvious immaturity of the young hostesses, who made it clear to me that they are not only very willing to, but take pleasure in making every effort to avoid a customers reasonable request, has left me with serious doubts as to whether I will continue to patronize a normally very pleasant and delicious lunch spot.", "author": "Jon S."}

We were told potatoes came with all the dishes and later found out that some of the scrambles did not come with them.

Other little things kept our visit from being pleasureable like curdled cream and missed drinks. I will say our server was on top of the booze when we asked for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "My whole family (4 of us) ate here on Thu night.  Upon walking up to the restaurant on Union street, we passed by an angry homeless man cursing at himself.  As we are not exactly used to this, this was surprising.  (I know this is not quite about the restaurant, but this person was sitting nearby & I want to be honest w/ the overall experience.)  As you walk in the entrance, you see a classic cozy American bar/restaurant (NYC style) w/ brass railings, dark wood walls & eclectic posters hanging on almost every square inch of wall space - love the ambiance right here!  Upon glancing at these pictures/posters, you'll notice several are of the Yankee baseball genre.  This not only confirms the \"NYC style\" I mentioned, but the owner must also be a Bronx bombers fan, accordingly.  Nothing wrong w/ that as I also love all things baseball!  It was also very busy - another great sign.  We were led through a fairly winding & snake like (w/ 90 degree turns) path, past the kitchen, that finally opened to a beautiful skylit room w/ only 4-5 tables (w/ blue checkerboard table cloths on them) in it.  Complete contradiction to the rest of the restaurant, but still very VERY nice!  Right next door to this room, on the other side of a glass wall, was another small dining room, inside, with no skylight.  Within this well lit room, you feel like you're sitting on a patio, as lower lying clouds race beautifully overhead (yes, we were having an early dinner).  Pictures on the wall in this \"lanai\"/room included one of Clint Eastwood in a scene from \"Dirty Harry\".  There is also 1 flat screen TV, in this case showing Giants baseball.  (Unfortunately, they were losing to a well fed Matt Kemp & the Braves this night.)  There are other flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant - very nice to see that too!  I ordered the poke starter & in keeping with the ocean theme, the seared Ahi burger as my entree.  As the poke was set down on the table, the first thing I noticed is how dark these diced fish pieces were.  As Ahi tuna is normally bright red, this is where my first half ding comes into play.  It still tasted OK, but the dark red fish signals a lack of freshness.  Still, I am impressed that Poke is even on the menu at a classic American NY style restaurant!  The burger was much better looking.  The bread of the bun was soft & seemed recently baked; the meat was pink on the inside, while of course, cooked well on the outside.  The lettuce & other accompaniments w/in this fish burger complimented each other nicely.  My daughter even commented that I devoured this burger surprisingly rapidly.  My wife had the french onion soup & says, \"I rank it high\".  My son had the hamburger w/ fries & loved all of that too.  Our daughter had the veggie burger w/ sweet potato fries - she ranks the fries a 10/10 & the burger a 7/10 as she felt there were too many seeds in the patty.  Although our server was friendly, helpful & attentive, he pushed a bottle of wine on us a little too hard.  He was trying to make us aware of all bottles being half off this day, but some people don't HAVE to drink.  Even though 2 glasses were the same price as the full bottle, some people don't NEED alcohol.  I definitely respect up-selling, but a little less salesmanship, please.  Two \"No thank you's\" should be enough, but 3 should definitely be the signal to stop.  The busboy was super friendly as well.  Quick note about the bathrooms - they sit perched high above the dining room area.  You have to walk up narrow & steep stairs in order to get to them - only one person can go up/down at a time.  Even though this would be tough on people w/ leg/hip/foot problems, I love this aspect actually - it's as if there's a secret upstairs crow's nest...but it's only the bathroom!  Overall, this restaurant was a great experience.  I loved the ultra fantastic feel of the place + the modern menu + the overall friendliness!

That is really all you have to know about Perry's.  If watching The Masters in a bar during Sunday brunch is your thing, you'll probably love Perry's.   If you'd rather be watching basketball, this ain't your spot.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, nothing was particularly bad, but nothing was particularly GREAT either.  Hence, the 3-star review.\n\nI should point out that the staff was very friendly and attentive, everyone from the hostess who seated me, to the waiter who took my order, to the busboy who brought me a small side of mayo.  \n\nBut the food?  Overall, pretty bland and flavorless.  No zing, no pizzazz, no zest.  \n\nI started with a cup of tomato bisque that was definitely more on the creamy side, more pink than red (hello, White People!!)  Compared to the tomato soup at the American Grilled Kitchen, this was just wimpy wimpy wimpy.  But I'm sure some investment banker in a bowtie thinks it's the cat's meow.  This soup is strictly for old ladies and Thurston Howell types.\n\nThe burger WAS big, I'll give them that.  I ordered it MEDIUM and it came to me MEDIUM, which is also impressive.  And, I liked the two big slices of tomato on the side.   But, taste-wise, there just wasn't anything there.  It's like, they knew what it should LOOK LIKE, but they forgot to put the flavor in it.  The same goes for the breakfast potatoes that I lieu of French fries.  Plenty of them, colorful, but ultimately lack-luster.   (Imagine you're taken prisoner by Aliens.  They want to feed you, they have images of what Earth food looks like, but no idea what it should taste like.  That's Perry's.)  \n\nSo, there you have it.

In fact on our latest trip here we were having dim sum in China Town when I suddenly realized we had not yet payed a visit. We were to depart for home that afternoon, but had the cab driver drop us off for a goodbye glass of vino. Ah, felt much better, thank you. \n\nBack in the day this is where many of the scribes and columnist from the local papers hung out, along with some now ex-mayors, attorneys, and other professionals. Generally a more mature crowd until the later hours, but even then the youngins tend to head to the cheaper and more rowdy nearby bars. Not that this is a quiet boring place.

BUt then it had two buttered biscuits on top so the top of the biscuit was flaky but the bottom was soft from sitting in the soup. Absolutely phenomenal and it was nice and warm. Then apple pie :D It was huge! It came with a scoop of ice cream and I couldn't even finish it. \n\nI think that this place is worth a visit and I would go again if I was in the area.

I'm always told it will be a 10 min wait (for my always small simple order) and it always ends up taking 30+ mins no matter what, and always entails me standing around in the cold entryway while awkwardly looking at the hostess, even when I wait 10 or 30 minutes to showing up after I put my order in. It's like they don't actually start putting it together or making it until your standing there waiting for it and ask a billion times. Most of the time the hostess is never even at the front at the stand. What are they doing? The hostesses are usually always slightly rude/disinterested and unprofessional. They should be representing the place in a positive way, it's usually the first (or only, if you're doing takeout) impression that the customers get. \n\nMeanwhile across the bridge, the larkspur location is amazing, I've never had any problems or long wait with anything, and everyone who works there is super friendly and gets stuff done.", "author": "Haley J."}

My eggs blackstone was very mediocre. The idea of the tomato and bacon sounded really good but in execution just didn't taste right. Lacked flavor. \n\nMy husband ordered the chorizo scramble and he was sorely disappointed. Undercooked eggs and a strange diced meat that definitely wasn't chorizo. The tortillas were laid in grease. \n\nMy 3 other friends had the French toast that was soggy and uneatable, the veggie omelet that the eggs again were undercooked and lacked flavor, the corn beef hash which was not corn beef and there was no hash which was ridiculous. 2 had bloody Mary's and they were watered down with very little alcohol. \n\nNot sure where they are getting their recipes or what's going on in that kitchen but we've never had such awful breakfast before. \n\nThe only good things they had was the breakfast potatoes and toast. \n\nThe decor is really cute and it looks well maintained.

I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 6 girlfriends around 9pm. The bar was not crowded and there were several other tables that were not occupied. We just wanted to grab a quick drink, or a bottle of wine before our dessert reservations across the street at American Cupcake.\n\nWhen we entered, we explained to the hostess that we just wanted to grab a drink at the bar, she did not look interested or welcoming, and just looked towards the bar area. She was more interested in having a conversation with her co-worker. When we walked into the bar, we sat ourselves at an empty round table, again there were several empty tables. When we sat down, a server walked up to us and the first thing she asked was \"are you guys ordering food\", no HELLO, or WELCOME, and she was very rude in the way she asked. We explained to her, just like we explained to the hostess, that we wanted to just order a bottle of wine and some drinks. She rudely took the menu's off the table and walked away. She did not even give us DRINK menu! We had to ask another girl in the bar area to give a drink menu...how the hell are we suppose to order a bottle of wine without a menu????? She returned with 1 menu for 6 people to share!!! At this point we were already irritated and wanting to leave, but we tried to stick it out and finally found some drinks and a bottle we wanted to order. As we wait for a server, another girl approaches our table and rudely explains to us that \"if someone comes in wanting to order food, we have to kick you off this table\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Not only was it after 9pm and your bar is only half full, but isn't your job in customer service? \n\nWe had enough bitchiness, rudiness, and unwelcoming behaviour that we just walked out.

Yes, a zillion.\n\nMimosas which were good, but if you want me to really be a brat, it seems like it wasn't with real orange juice.  I personally like super pulpy orange juice with it, so if you like that too, don't order a mimosa here.  \n\nThe potato skin appetizer was enough to be an entree in itself!!  It was soooo good, and definitely worth the price ~$9 if you're sharing it with a bunch of people.\n\nThe eggs florentine was good, but it wasn't super flavorful... maybe because I just had the potato skins.  My friend and I split this dish because it comes with two + more potatoes.\n\nWe ordered a side of chicken apple sausage which was delicious (it comes with two), but not worth $4.50.\n\nI don't think I'd come here again, but I enjoyed my experience overall :)  For the amount of food you get, the prices are reasonable...

Didn't even come close to filling me up.\n\nEggs - scrambled eggs are good.  Had a texture that makes me wonder what they cooked them with (1 pound of butter, maybe).  Almost filled me up from the inadequate pancakes.\n\nEggs Florentine - had some of my g/f's egg Florentine.  Pretty good.  You won't be disappointed with it, except for the mediocre side of potatoes it comes with.  \n\nCoffee - good enough.  \n\nService was on point.

He said the calamari came in thin slices and that there weren't any tentacles (WRONG) His response was oh it was different last time I ordered it. We also each ordered a cup of soup(clam chowder and tomato)I got the pot roast and she a salad. Mr. my resume speaks for itself doesn't know how to course your meal as everything arrived at the same time. The tomato soup was so sweet that it was inedible, the pot roast was awful, bland and greasy aftertaste. I returned mine and we left shortly after. \nAs a bartender and a representative of the restaurant you may not want to drop \"F\" Bombs so casually with every sentence.

We ordered a bottle of wine that we're familiar with, have purchased it from stores often, but the wine they provided was of a different year (2011, not 2010) than what was advertised on the menu!...I verified this by asking for the menu back.  The wine tasted drastically different, for the worse, than the wine we expected, i.e. the actual wine ordered!  Given that we're paying an extreme markup on this wine ($44 + tip, for a bottle we've purchased in stores for $14), I was not willing to bite this bullet.  If the 2011 wine would have tasted no different than the 2010 we expected, then I never would have thought anything of it, but it was much different!  Anyone with even a novice understanding of wine knows that one year to the next can make a drastic difference on the wine quality.\n\nWhen addressing this problem during my first glass of wine, the manager (a blonde woman) was initially refusing to correct the situation and was very rude in her effort to explain why.  Our discussion with the manager was after she made the poor waitress try telling us there would be no adjustment to the check.  We immediately felt unwelcome and had no desire to continue dining, even when the manager finally agreed to help after my continued complaint and explanation of why this was not okay.  It was too late, the damage was done.  We never even heard the words \"sorry\" or \"apologize\" come from the manager's mouth.  In fact, instead of apologizing, she told us we should have addressed the problem earlier into the bottle!  I remind you, my wife and I were in the middle of our first glasses when I spoke with the waitress about it.  Coming from a family of restaurant owners and managers, I considered the handling of this situation a management 101 mistake.

I also remember an excellent chicken dinner, again like something I'd find at home. \n\nPerry's is in prime location right in the heart of the marina on Union St. I wouldn't recommend it before a night out, unless you've got a few hours to rest and digest before you play some beer pong over at Bar None.

The food is always consistent and the condiments are normal. No surprises here. The downside was our waitress. She was nice and could memorize our orders without a writing it down - something I always found a bit impressive, but also a bit precarious. Our dishes came out fine.

Do you think I'm ready to have dessert while I'm still on my main course? Go away. The one time there isn't a line for the outdoor seating, the waitress has to push me to my next course.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-10", "description": "I love Perry's, and have been going there for over 20 years.\n\nRecently, I wrote a review of Perry's Cheeseburger on my blog (http://mitchellschneider.wordpress.com/), and here are parts of it...\n\nPerry's has been a Bay Area institution for over 40 years. And while their menu boasts a number of delicious items, Perry's is best known for it's hamburger. I couldn't think of a better place to sample my first cheeseburger of 2011 than at Perry's, and per usual, I was not disappointed.\n\nI went on a Sunday afternoon, and the bar area was jammed with post-New Year's Day revelers. They put me at a table in the rear of the restaurant - which I wasn't all that pleased with since there's not much of a scene in the back - but I should have known better... the place is always full on the weekends.\n\nOne of the great things about dining at Perry's is their ample supply of breadsticks and butter they place on your table before the meal (and all of this is complimentary, though sometimes you have to ask for them). The breadsticks are awesome, and if you're not careful, these blissful sticks-o-bread can derail your appetite before your main course comes. I did help myself to a few breadsticks, but in anticipation of my killer burger, I went easy on them.\n\nMy Perry's bacon-cheeseburger-with-fries came out about 20 minutes after I ordered it, and when it finally arrived, I was stoked. The first thing you notice about their burger is its presentation - it's simply beautiful. The burger occupies about half of the oval plate, with the garnish and fries taking up the rest. And the burger is big - it stands a good three inches on the plate, and the whole entire dish looks classy against the checkered blue tablecloth that Perry's has employed for decades.\n\nPerry's doesn't skimp on fries - which I love - and they bury a sliced dill pickle alongside the burger which is also a treat.\n\nEverything about the meal was perfect, EXCEPT the mini bowl of ketchup that they place on the plate... I hate this. Why do restaurants do this? Just make life easy for everyone, and put a bottle of Heinz on the table... do it.\n\nAfter dressing my burger with ketchup, and re-applying some onions and lettuce that had fallen to the side, I picked up my cheeseburger with both hands and went for it. The first bite is really something: you taste the cooked bun, burger meat, cheddar cheese and bacon in one fell swoop, and it's all fantastic. The meat is juicy with a great taste; the bacon is crispy; and the cheese balances everything else without overpowering you. This was exactly what I wanted, and why Perry's is so beloved.\n\nThe next few bites are just as good, and impressive for the following reasons:\n\n-The burger, though big, stays together (whereas other burgers that size often fall apart in clumps)\n-The bun-to-meat ratio is money; there's plenty of bun to hold everything together, but not enough to make you feel you're consuming an entire baguette\n-There are actual meaty strips of \"Hobbs\" bacon on the burger, rather than smaller 1-2 inch strips placed unceremoniously atop the meal\n-The garnish is fresh (which isn't always the case)\n\nThe Perry's burger takes about ten to 12 minutes to consume (though I eat pretty quickly), and each bite is really a treat. If you're like me, you save your fries 'til the very end, and, like the burger, are also impossible to put down.", "author": "Mitch S."}

We planned a month or so in advance and worked with the party planner on site (Mollie) to see what our options were. She was very helpful, and knowledgable about the options we had.\n\nWhen it came time for the night of the party she was not there, but other staff helped us out with our requests. They seemed to be knowledgable about our party as well which was great.\n\nWe had customized menus, brought in our own cake (there is a cakeage fee), and had a few select wines waiting for us in the back patio room we reserved. Tables were already nicely set up, and we were allowed to bring in our own decorations as well.\n\nI was quite pleased with the readyness of the room, staff, etc. The appetizers we ordered (guacamole and tuna tacos tasted pretty good). The appetizers themselves came to $105 and I did not think for the amount we got it was worth that much, but no need to complain, as we had many guests, and that would be tacky.\n\nWe were told that 2 of the girls attending could split a meal and we would only be charged for one of theirs. We ended up being charged for both anyways, but again, I didn't want to complain in front of the guests. It was mentioned before the party, it should have been handled. It's too bad it wasn't. The party total cost ended up being WAY above what I thought it would be (some people did order hard alcohol which was not one of the options so that's probably part of the reason).\n\nThe food was just okay. I ordered the clam chowder (good), and the petrole sole with rice and veggies (meh). I've had better. But the party itself was quite enjoyable, which made up for the so-so food.\n\nAll in all, it was a great party, the staff was wonderful, the organization was great, the place itself looked amazing, only a few mishaps with the bill, and the cost was very pricey (about $62 a person if not more including tip and alcohol).\n\nI'd still recommend to a friend to plan a party here if they were in need of a place, but I'd suggest to look elsewhere to find other options before they decide as this is the only place in SF I've hosted a party thus far.", "author": "Ashley D."}

Had lunch with old friends at Perry's the other day and it was better than ever.  There is a timeless, cheerful homeyness reminiscent of the saloon made so famous in the long running televisions series Cheers, and when you add really great food you get a home run.  Impeccably clean, well tended and professionally staffed, the food is remarkable for the scope and integrity of the menu, but truly delivers on quality.  It was a cool, gray, rainy day and the minute we walked in the entryway and were greeted by a pert, striking hostess who quickly showed us to a window table in the front dining room, the day became lighter and more interesting.  The blue and white check table clothes, chicken wire tile floors, contemporary prints and photos framed and hung perfectly throughout the whole restaurant, the centerpiece bar, and the involved crowd busy sharing their news at tables and the bar made for a thriving community within the outside world and brought comfort to all of us.\n\nA busser promptly arrived with water, bread sticks and unsalted butter, followed immediately by a waiter with menus and a cheerful welcome.  I knew I wanted their burger, one of the best I've ever had and still among my favorite burgers in the world.  We started with a split Caesar, grilled artichoke, corn chowder and fried calamari and it was all just mouth watering good.  I had my burger, others had grilled salmon, Chopped Salad,  Meatloaf and mashers, fettucine and roast chicken and everyone raved through each bite.  I say all this because eating in a bar restaurant is almost a thing of the past and yet Perry's offers 4 star food in a relaxed and totally comfortable environment at prices that allow the dream of a foreign sports car in the near future.  My burger was sensational, the custom bun, toasted just right and almost tailored to the meat and fixings, thoughtful and spot on.  The meat tasted fresh, was cooked as ordered and was accompanied by with house made chips that were the only disappointment the table experienced, they were cold and tasteless.  But the burger was big and sumptuous and each bite felt like I was at heaven's gate.  \n\nAt Perry's time seems to matter less than at most other restaurants, maybe because it feels like a breath of fresh air, a respite or escape from pressure and stress, and it really is.  The decor, the drinks, the staff, the design and warmth, and the food, brought to life by plenty of happy faces and churning conversation make for a fine dining experience.

Tonight we sat down for dinner and they served us a steak salad (my wife) and a red snapper (myself) for dinner. \n\nThe food arrived and my wife looked down at her food and a bug was dripped in salad dressing moving upside down and she freaked out and sent it back. The waiter who served it has known us for years and immediately sent it back. \n\nOur waiter came back and served my wife a new salad like nothing happened. He didn't say sorry and actually just acted like nothing happened. What disturbed us most is that he didn't offer to take anything off the bill or apologize. The bill was shown as if nothing happened (except for the salad my wife didn't eat) and this is most heart breaking since we have been the biggest fans and this is all the response we got after 10 years. \n\nWe don't want to come back here again just based on their actions. Its too bad this is the way Perry treats all his long time customers.", "author": "Tony H."}

From the beginning, I've never been super impressed or blown away by this place. Nothing on the menu ever catches my eye. A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I went for brunch because all of the other restaurants in the neighborhood weren't doing brunch because of the Union St. Fair. So we settled on Perry's. We ordered two Bloody Marys which arrived in Dixie cups. They were awful! Mostly mix, not spicy, and no alcohol. The table next to us left because they were so turned off by their drinks. Then they tried to charge us $9 for the bloodies, which is a dollar more than what they usually are in a bigger glass! We could not believe it. The food was decent but lost my appetite because of the rude waitress and the shitty drinks!", "author": "Jamie E."}

I chose not to complain as I was just happy with my company.\n\nA friend of my friend, who is a regular there, showed up later.  He recommended some food choices and we ate based on that.

I went a couple times a month, even though I came back to the office $25 lighter.  When that Perry's on Sutter and Kearny Streets finally closed, I thought \"good riddance.\"  Now I am going through Perry's withdrawals.\n\nToday after helping a friend move, all I wanted was a cold Diet Coke and a sandwich.  We walked over to Perry's looking AMAZING after a whole day of driving and carrying bags of clothes; both she and I wore shorts and slightly sweaty t-shirts.  We were seated right away at a table in the back - I guess they didn't want their other customers to see us.  The crowd at this location is definitely as Marina as it gets.\n\nI ordered a portobello and steak sandwich with fries ($16.50).  It was an open faced sandwich, which basically means this: some grilled onions on top of a small steak on top a piece of portobello mushroom on baguette-type bread.  The steak, surprisingly, was cooked medium, just like I ordered.   The mushroom was a bit too thin, but it had a lot of flavor.  The onions on top were a bit too vinegary for my taste, and I didn't want to eat too many of them.  The fries were just OK: \"either undercooked or overcooked,\" as my friend said.\n\nOur server Max was super nice and very helpful.  He was pretty busy, but he seemed to have made time for us.  Definitely a big plus.  Oh, and the place also has several flat screen TVs, which makes it possible to watch the games from just about every angle.\n\nPerry's walls, not unlike those at Just For You (http://www.yelp.com/biz/just-for-you-cafe-san-francisco#hrid:zrleE76ANbS5q8oEhCjHfA), are decorated with random fun stuff.

Maybe it's because I just know it's there, and I know what to expect. \n\nBrunch was relatively tasty. I got the huevos rancheros, and they were good. For dinner, I tried a special steak sandwich of theirs. The food, in general, is what you would expect. It's pretty good, but nothing that will change your life.\n\nThe ambiance, however, just doesn't do it for me. I've sat outside twice because the inside was too loud, or too drunk, or just seemed pretentious. (Yep, that's what I said: it \"seemed\" pretentious.) The seating in the front is more lively (around the bar, of course), and there is a huge seating area in the back that is just... fine. A few TVs and a very quiet scene, which is generally where they seat the families. \n\nThe two hostesses that I've dealt with acted rude or apathetic, as though it was a chore to seat us-- even though I would go out of my way to be nice to them. \n\nThe waitstaff is great. Always friendly and relatively speedy. And Perry's has a few good beers on tap. \n\nSo, knowing me, I will be back again. And the food will be good and the service will be fine.

It's like what should have been advertised was salad dressing with lettuce toppings.\n\nEvery now and I then I like seafood in my diet.  Fresh seafood is often best and full of nutrition.  Next best is all forgotten cod.  A relatively tasteless fish that is often brought to life by deep frying it in beer batter or massive amounts of oil and butter.  Using a cornmeal crust destroys the cods little flavor by producing a breading that is gooey, soggy and overbearing.  Now honestly, if I'm intent on destroying my body, it better damn taste good.    \n\nCharging $2.75 for a soft drink is fine.  Most restaurants do that these days; it's part of staying in business.  But most of these restaurants offer free refills for charging that much.  Charging $1 to refill coke when 3/4 of the cup was ice is in bad taste.  If a restaurant is that desperate to make a buck, increase the price of your entrees.  Oh wait ... looks like Perry's already did that.   Shhhhhh....\n\nGenerally I don't gripe about servers.  Servers often work hard, wear their feet out and are subjected to hot plates and high maintenance customers.  This poor guy ... are you sure he's a server?  I don't think he spoke English.  He never checked on us.  He might as well have been a drone punching a time clock.  I don't remember seeing a crank in his back. \n\nSometimes now when I think about alcohol and food, I have forgotten about Perry's.  Other places in the Marina seem to offer better food, better service.  After all, the Marina is full of people with plenty of cabbage.   Who wants cabbage ... anybody ....

I'm usually a fan of bar/pub food - you know burgers, quesadillas, steaks, fish & chips.  Usually a plethora of American food.  We stopped by here one Tuesday evening on a whim after trying to decide amongst the million places on Union & Chestnut streets.  I shouldve went with Cappinina!  Dammit!!!  \n\nAnyway, it started off ok.  I didn't really like the decor, maybe just too dirty looking for me, with that tile floor and bar atmosphere.  But whatever, I just want a simple burger - that stuff doesn't really matter.  So the service was extremely slow this night.  Slow slow slow slow SLOW.  Did I mention slow?  Everyone gets off nights, fine whatever - gimme my burger.  We finally order, me choosing the veggie burger, my friends choosing the cobb salad, a cheeseburger, and a club sandwich.  Finally the food comes, SUPER SLOW DID I MENTION, and right before its served one of the waiters accidently knocks the plates over.  Boom, burgers flying everywhere with french fries in the mist.  It was in slow motion.  Ok fine, accidents happen whatever.  It took forever again!  You would think in an accident like that they might speed it up, but it just took forever.  Finally food comes.  It was what I expected - delicious, hearty portions.  However I didn't really like my veggie burger (not that it was bad) I just prefer veggie burgers that have more veggie/cheese in the patty then mostly smashed beans.  \n\nAnyway I really thought since we were there for so long something would get comped off the receipt, especially in such an American place (I would NEVER expect this from a chinaman).  But no, nothing.  I was even charged twice for two icetea/lemondes because I asked for a refill.  $3.50 for half ice tea half lemonade, TWICE?  Not cool.  The only reason I had to order two beverages was because of the long wait.  And again, in America there are usually free refills!  Especially on something as cheap as ice tea.  \n\nEh, mediocre experience.  Half price wine did salvage some of this experience.  Will not be back.  Jovino is just to close!", "author": "Tiffany L."}

The restaurant definitely has character, which would be great if you could eat picturesque surroundings. If you came here for a quiet drink and nothing else, you'd probably come away with a better impression.\n\nHowever, we wanted dinner. The clam chowder was rubbery, the macaroni and cheese was basically noodles floating in water sprinkled with bread crumbs, and the smoked chicken sandwich was credit-card size and made from standard deli meat...yet it was still hard to swallow (the $14 price tag for the sandwich alone, that is). I'm not against spending $30 to $50 on a decent meal, but it's irksome to pay $25 for the equivalent of a Lunchables pack.\n\nIf you want to read stuff on the walls, this is a great place to sit and do so.

If you're the type to get nostalgic of having real drinks at a wooden bar while the bartender wears a starch white collared shirt and knows your name? Perry's may fit the bill. However being on Union St, it doesn't do anything for me. A and I had decided to have lunch here because the decor called out comfort.\n\nSeated inside with a great sunny view outside, our waiter was at best attentive because it was his job, but could care less about adding some care to his customers. I had a cobb salad, which was alright - bacon overcooked and too crunchy (how can you ruin bacon? I tasted char in some of the bites) and the red wine vinegarette turned out to be more of an oily dressing which really diminish the flavors of everything else on the plate. He had meatloaf with creamy mash potatoes and veggies, which was the best of out two orders. The meatloaf was light, not too dry but the mash potatoes was yummy, you can taste the buttery goodness in every fork full.\n\nThe staff wasn't doing it for me, in a place like this I expected comfort and cheer.

Today: Marie the french intern and I headed to Perry's for soup, because she has a cold.  I ordered tomato bisque and a small Caesar (which was wayy too much food).  The bisque was good and served really hot with croutons on top.  The Caesar was only okay, the dressing didn't have much flavor, and seemed like it had a lot of mayo in it, and no garlic.  Marie ordered the chunky vegetable (Marie parie: \"what does this mean? chunky?\" me:\"Uh, with big, chunks? Pieces? like, it has vegetables in it.\") she liked it very much.  A bowl of soup will set you back $6.75.  Their salads are too expensive.  when we walked in, a channel five news crew was interviewing a group of 3 girls about the 49ers.  They asked us if we were fans, but I was having a bad hair day so I said \"i am sorry but i don't know anything about them, what are they?\" in my best French accent.  They left us alone.  \nThe service here is really slow, it took us like 15 min after we ordered to get our soup! Soup! Soup is pre-made, people.  But I like the decor and all the (sorry guys) old men who work here.  They are classic.\n\n__________\nUpdate: went back again for more soup, they have really awesome bacon bits! so crispy!\n__________\nUpdate 2: Check out my compliments, the chef from the downtown Perry's wrote to me to say that he would be looking into the ceasar issue, and that he would buy me a free salad.  While I won't take him up on this on principle, I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to read the reviews and act upon them!  It shows he cares about both locations and is actively trying to improve, there is nothing worse than a multi-location restaurant with a stale formula, and I don't think Perry's will ever fall into this category because they are very conscious!", "author": "Natalie K."}

The Kir Royal revived my buzz from the night before, and the all american cuisine was just mouthwatering to look at. I had the mac and cheese (good, but pale in comparison to Home just down the street), mini cheeseburgers, and the calamari. Could've done without the calamari, it was pretty boring. Plus I didn't like the cornmeal crust they used instead of the regular batter. AND the cocktail sauce was more ketchupy than spicy. But we had fun, were loud, drunk and ran into a bunch of friends there who were also loud and drunk. Don't think the older patrons much cared for us. Some dirty looks were thrown our way as we were leaving. Oh well. we still had fun, and the manager bought us a round of shots ;)\r\nOh.... and on a side note, this place falls from 4 stars to 3, because the hostess was a BIATCH. So unfriendly, and did not get us the outside table like she was supposed to, and allowed some other group to just walk up and sit there instead. And when we said to her, hey weren't you supposed to let us know when our table was ready? She told us to go talk it out with the group that snagged the table on our own! I was like huh??? isn't that YOUR job? to manage the seating?? Guess she was just too busy flirting with some guy instead. I hope the servers don't tip her out much cause she is SO not worthy of any of it.", "author": "Marina K."}

Want a drink to start dinner?  You *might* have a waiter greet the table within the first 20 minutes of sitting down.  And then *might* get your drink within 10 minutes after that.  If you're lucky.  Really, really lucky.  Then you may get your food, even if it's just a burger, within an hour.\n\nDecent food.  Waiters are all dipshits.  Most customers are dipshits too - typical California douche-bags.  I ate here simply because it was the closest place to my apartment, and my girlfriend at the time was worthless and never cooked shit.\n\nAgain, if Perry's wasn't in San Francisco, they would be out of business after a month.  But for some reason, making customers wait forever, and serving mediocre food is the standard in this town, so they seem to fill seats.\n\nSan Francisco desperately needs more chain restaurants to make local businesses quit being so lazy.  And full of themselves.  And actually serve customers.", "author": "Benjy E."}

The ancient host (male) Acted like it was very stressful to even answer a simple question, like \"How long will the wait be?\" But we did get in, and the food is nothing special, but just ok if you will... But the reason I am down grading Perry's is that the other day we went there for breakfast. And there was not even a hostess at the door to give us a seat. We waited, and waited... Nothing! People dinning inside watching us just standing in he entry feeling abused! Finaly we went inside to try and get service... (seated) And the ditzy hostess was walking by with a menu in her hands. We told her we had waited for seating, and needed to be seated. She like a dumb twit had the gawl to try and say we are supposed to wait outside! And that she was only gone a second! We explained that we were out there and she wasn't! Then we left! My girlfriend then went back and told her straight of how it went down... and that she was not there..

The drinks were delicious and the waitress kept them flowing, although in the 2 hours we were there I don't think she cracked a smile once.  Since it was an all-day drinkfest, most of us opted for the burger, which was delicious and cooked exactly to my specifications.

Last week on Saturday night I went to Perry's for the 3rd time and it seems it just keeps getting better! \n\nMe and my friends arrived at a late hour with a group of 15 and the two hostesses were very sweet and acomidating (not to mention HOT!). There were people throughout the whole restaurant and it seemed these girls were doing a bit of everything, bussing tables, running food, and seating the wait list tey had going on! They acted as if they were expecting us and had us sat within minutes!\n\nOur waitress was very funny and so nice. She was attentive but not annoying. I know we had stopped her from getting off of her shift, but she acted as if it was no problem at all. (mind you we were a party of 15! that takes about 3 hours to eat and it was already 10:00pm!) \n\nThe food was amazing as usuall. The chopped salami salad is something ive never tasted before, AMAZING! My friend had the burger and has gone back to pick it up as take out 3 times! The seared ahi was amazing, the calamari was good but a little too much breading. The potate skins were delicious. But the to best things I think were the pot roast dinner my giflfriend had, and the steak sandwhich I had. Both were to die for. The steack sandwich is made with tenderloin steak over a portableo mushroom and grilled onions on an open faced grilled garlic bread! The pot roast was sooo delicious and the best comfort food I've had in a while.\n\nThe atmosphere at Perrys is always laid back and fun.

I forgot that I had my Pretty Woman moment there. You know, when she walks into a store on Rodeo Drive, and the sales woman says, \"We don't have your size!\" \n\nA while ago I was looking for a dress on Union St. and my friends and I decided to have lunch. It was early in the day on a random Wednesday. We decided to go to Perry's on Union. The waiter/ host an older bald, mennie said if we wanted to have lunch we could sit in the back!\n \nThe back! There was no one in the restaurant! There were tables outside and it was such a nice day we thought we could sit outside. He said they were \"reserved\", and then continues to put reserve signs on all the tables outside. Disgusted, we left!\n\nFlash forward to yesterday.\n\nI was on my way to work on Union St. and my friend wanted to meet for lunch, I was thinking Jovino, La Boulange, or even Jamba Juice, she wanted something more substantial. Alright it's a nice day, let's go to Perry's. The host was nice and sat us in the front section of the restaurant. It was almost full. The coveted sidewalk tables were all full. I forgot about my whole Pretty Woman moment. \n\nThe waitress a chunky, blonde woman, dress like she just rolled off of bed and put her hair in a bun took our order. My friend wanted wine but wasn't sure of what kind she wanted. The waitress did not make any suggestions and hovered over us, annoyed that she didn't know what wine to get. Suggestion to the waitress: put in our order and come back when she decides which wine! Anyways, we order a Chinese chicken salad and sliders: mini cheese burgers. The salad came out first, good, big proportions. Then I noticed everyone else had bread stick on their tables and we had none. I didn't want any, but still annoyed we weren't asked. Finished with our salad the slides came out, looking cute and delicious! I asked for them to be cooked medium-well and I had two bites and the middle was frozen and rare. Gross! Do they use frozen patties? That ruined our appetite. I told the waitress and she was annoyed. No lady, and calling her a lady is being kind, send this back and make them well done, at least not rare frozen in the middle. Gross! I had to say it again.  She took the plate. \nMy friend told me she was very rude and was thinking she should call the manager. Oh yeah, it's all coming back to me now. I personally banned this place! Why did I come here?! I am not coming back and telling everyone not to too!\n\nShe changed her attitude a little when she heard my friend was thinking to speak with the manager. She also tried to charge us twice for the burgers. \n\nMy friend says they are racist, because we were Asian and Latin. But I say Perry, get a new staff and you'll never see me again. \n\nBanned for life!", "author": "Melisa O."}

The service is not so great either,  it seems way too lax for a place that should be pulling in lots of the lunch and after work crowd.  Even when I went for a late lunch, when there was hardly anyone around, it seemed to take quite awhile to get a menu and my drink order in.  I was told by the bartender that the calamari was excellent....no lie it was the worst calamari I've ever had.

Have you no jobs people!  I was off that day if your wondering.  But back to Perry's.  The greeter guy with the raspy voice spent a good 10 minutes answering my questions about the menu and suggesting his favorite dishes and I thank him for steering me away from the friend chicken and talking up the pot roast, which I ended up ordering.  It was tasty, but from the previous review, I consumed a half a stick of butter and didn't even know it....oh my!  I was also entertained by some guy and his two grandaughters visiting from England while he sang \"Lets Call The Whole Thing Off\" twice, purely for the girl's entertainment.  Any other time I would have been annoyed, but it was all in good fun.  The waitstaff chatted it up with some locals/regulars at the bar and overall everything just felt laid back.

It was simple lunch fare, sandwiches and salads, nothing that should take more than 15 minutes and yet we didn't get our food until 40 minutes later. The food itself is quite good, their french onion soup with a HUGE slab of cheese is delicious but its quite pricey.

After watching the Blue Angles on a less-than-stable roof and crawling around in pure darkness in the Tactile Dome at the Exploratorium, I met up with some friends for dinner and drinks in the Marina. I was kind of in a bad mood because I couldn't find bus stops where I needed them to be and I was bitter about the carload of boys in pink collard shirts yelling into my ear like hyenas as they drove by. My friends chose to eat at Perry's, which I knew about because last year I wrote an article featuring Perry's 25th(30th???) anniversary. I was actually excited to try it out. Although I wasn't that hungry because I had eaten an $8 sandwich at the Exploratorium, I ordered the Mac and Cheese and boy did that cheer me up. I seriously went from surly chick with the black hair that doesn't fit in, in the Marina to happiest chick ever, consuming mass quantities of melted cheese. Our waitress was super sweet and patient (which was a necessity seeing that I was with five other drunk and semi-obnoxious diners.

As we stood next to her table chatting, we were asked by a very nice man to have a seat, as they were trying to avoid people standing in that area. Fine. He couldn't get us anymore chairs, but suggested we ask a neighboring table for a couple, which we did. The folks at that table advised that they'd be leaving in 2-3 minutes. We got a few drinks at the bar while we waited.  As they stood to leave, my husband stood up to grab a chair (as we'd been TOLD to do) and ANOTHER completely RUDE alleged manager told him that he couldn't have the chair. My husband and I told him that we'd been told by another employee that we could take a chair. The manager said \"Just leave.\" I swear. I'm not making this up. We both had full beers and he told us to sit them down and leave.  WHAT?!  Needless to say, we will never go back.  I've never experienced such utter disdain for customer service.

All of the tables around us that arrived after we did had eaten their meals and left before ours even arrived!  My friend asked for a medium burger and hers came out raw.  She sent it back.

While ambiance, tasty food, service are the classic criteria by which I would rank a place like Perry's, there is one category that trumps all of these--FOOD SAFETY.  My boyfriend and I were at Perry's Saturday with a group of six.  Two of the guests (including my BF) had a \"Bull Shot\" which is a cocktail that contains vodka, celery salt and beef stock.  It sounds nasty but doesn't taste half bad, if perhaps a bit salty.  Here's the catch - the beef stock was from a tin can left unrefrigerated on the bar.  The two guys who had the bull shot got food poisoning a few hours later and spent the afternoon and evening curled up in the bathroom.  Now for those doubts out there let me add that neither guy was simply drunk-these guys were relatively sober and these two can hold their own with the best of 'em.

Hell, I've even summered in Nantucket since I was old enough to trim a foresail. In any case, I always order the fish n' chips, inevitably request extra malt vinegar, and end up tipping the old man serving me more than I planned---mostly because I suspect he trimmed some vowels from his name just to land the job.", "author": "Veljko S."}

Which was completely understandable because nothing on union st was really open except the Starbucks and Jamba Juice. But there was only one other party there so...that might have taken away from the atmosphere. Anyways, the food was ok. I got the french toast and my bf got the mexican omelet. I had 5 triangles (so 2 1/2 pieces of bread) of French Toast and a cup of syrup. The french toast was ok. The bread was super thin (like the kind you buy at the grocery store to make homemade sandwiches) so that was a little disappointing. But I didnt finish it anyways so why complain? My bf's meal looked much better. The mexican omelet was HUGE and came with toast and potatoes. The potatoes looked delicious although I did not try them. He definetely got his money's worth...i on the other hand felt a little jipped. I left the restaurant satisfied but I would have much rather hit up Polkers on Polk St. since its closer and the same price. They did however give me fresh fruit on my french toast (i asked for it) and did not charge me. Granted it was no more than one strawberry chopped up...most places would have charged a few bucks!", "author": "Sarah I."}
