No meat.\n \n(An actual conversation I've had with a waitress)\n \nFor vegans and vegetarians who find their waitfolk aren't knowledgeable or honest about whats on the menu, a  vegetarian restaurant is comforting.  No danger of food cooked in lard, no errant fish sauce, no misunderstandings.  You can eat everything on the menu. How cool is that?\n\nI  wanted to love Enjoy.  It's accessible- just a brisk walk from Bart, and close enough to the Portsmouth parking garage that you might even talk yourself into driving to it. The menu is extensive. The menu is interesting. Vegetarian cuttlefish?  Vegetarian sea slugs?  How exciting is that?  And Reishi medicine soup, filled with jizi, hong zhao  and dang seng goodness\n \nBut\nThe service is lackadaisical.  Its Chinatown. We expect that.  Or maybe its worse than lackadaisical.\nMy party was there until closing- we were the only ones in the restaurant.   At 8:45 they flashed the lights.   They couldn't just come to the table  and remind us that they were closing in 15 minutes?    How...Walmart... of them.\nAnd the food was fairly bland, and significantly less interesting that its descriptions\n \nBut with a  menu as extensive as theirs, its worth a go-back.  Maybe we ordered poorly. All six of us.  Two stars, but I'm reserving the right to come back later and be wowed.", "author": "Sam X."}

I took a seat by the window and was given free hot tea right away. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very basic and the table and chairs look cheap and worn. It could look worse, but I wouldn't come here for the ambience if that is something you are looking for. The menu was posted outside of their door, so I already knew what I wanted to order before I sat down. \n\nI noticed the menu prices were rather high since these kind of hole-in-the-wall vegetarian restaurants are known to be usually really cheap. The entrees were all $12.99 and I ordered the Golden Knots which were $13.99. I tried to ask if they were made in-house or bought elsewhere and reheated, but I think there was a language barrier and she didn't know what I was asking. Luckily, the Golden Knots were delicious and had a satisfying taste and texture. \n\nI would come here again to try other things on the menu, but not if I was trying to impress someone with ambience.", "author": "Regina W."}

I've been to the Kearny location but this was my first time at this location. In terms of ambiance, I definitely prefer this location. It felt cleaner and better ventilated than the Kearny location. In addition, the staff were so nice and attentive. They gave us recommendations for what to order, checked in periodically to make sure the food was good, and refilled our tea and water.\n\nThe menu was the same as the one at Kearny, and as far as I can tell, they use the same ingredients and cooking styles. We ordered the following: \n\n- small veggie shark fin's soup ($8.99) - Wow! I was surprised at how good this was. It came with soy protein, mushrooms, and bamboo in a savory broth. They gave us red vinegar to drizzle in the soup, which added such a complex flavor. The small was the perfect size for the two of us. \n\n- braised spareribs with daikon ($12.99) - I absolutely loved this dish. There were chunks of vegan protein (mushroom-based), daikon radish, carrots, mushrooms, and cabbage. The sauce was thick and savory, with a bit of sweetness. I highly recommend this dish!\n\n- house special fried rice with BBQ pork & veggie ham ($10.99) - This dish was pretty standard, but the chunks of vegan bbq pork and vegan ham were tasty and flavorful. Next time I would like to try the spinach and pine nut fried rice that other Yelpers mentioned. \n\nEnjoy Vegetarian is one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants in the Bay Area, and probably my favorite place to get vegan Chinese food. Their dishes are just so flavorful, and they have a huge variety of items to choose from. If only I lived closer to SF so I could eat here every week!", "author": "Tiffany L."}

It sounded good so I was willing to give it a try.  Took BART and the #44 bus to get to 9th and Kirkham and walked a couple of blocks.  Saw the restaurant on the corner and was wondering why this place was in the middle of a residential area!  When I walked in, it was on the small side and looked at the menu.  There is a large array of items to choose from including items with fake meat in them.  I found a few dishes I wanted to try and decided on #35 Coconut sauce with taro, soy chicken and pumpkin which was tasty but the soy chicken tasted like pork belly and I thought that was what I ordered.  Fake chicken, oh well, it tasted fatty anyway!  \n\nWe also ordered:\n#2 Steamed dumpling\n#10 Salt and Pepper fried pumpkin - tasty but I was trying to be good and not eat fried\n#12 Golden Basket with deep fried vegetables tempura, veggie nugget (that my friends said tasted like a chicken nugget, crispy chicken and wonton which tasted like fried wonton skin)\n#15 Veggie duck - which was good but didn't taste like duck\n#16 Veggie shark's fin soup - the small size was enough for more than 2-3 people.  It tasted fabulous like the real shark's fin soup!\n#71 Spicy Ma Po Tofu which was spicy and tasty but not too hot\n#75 House Special Chow Mein\n#91 Spinach and pine nuts fried brown rice - good\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how tasty and flavorful how the food was.

I can barely go a day without meat, seafood, and/or dairy but to go months...years...without? Talk about incredible self-control. I guess it's safe to assume that most who practice Kama Sutra are also vegetarian or vegans because gawd knows how much discipline it takes to not be a two pump chump.\n\nI will never have the self-control to be a vegetarian or vegan but I can easily go a day without being a carniwhore when dining at Enjoy Vegetarian. What we sampled from the menu was very flavorful and didn't make me miss meat at all (well for the time being). \n\nEnjoy Vegetarian has over 125 items on the menu so there's going to be a lot of hit or misses (online menu is not up-to-date). Do ask for staff recommendations or go with highlighted items on Yelp.\n\nBased on Buddhist Vegetarian Principles, they don't use any onion and garlic. No MSG, dairy, and eggs are used so everything is vegan friendly as well. There's also brown rice available so you can satisfy your carb craving without the guilt.\n\nEnjoy Vegetarian is NOT the best date place as the decor is tacky which is not surprising; it's a Chinese joint after all. Seems like they rummaged through a Dollar Tree store after the 4th of July sale with their bright red and blue plastic chairs in the dining room. Parking is a biatch so do expect to be circling around, and around, and around. Give yourself at least 15-20 minutes to find parking on the weekends. \n\nAs recommended by Yelpers we started with the Veggie Shark Fin Soup (Small - $7.50) which was fantastic: http://bit.ly/1eJQ1Dt. It was flavorful and full of faux shark fin which had the same silky yet crunchy texture. Highly recommended especially on a cold, foggy SF night.\n\nA wedding banquet favorite, the Walnut Shrimp ($14.95) arrived next: http://bit.ly/19i7en8. The \"shrimp\" had a very similar texture and taste to the real deal but the batter was a bit soggy. The candied walnuts were addicting but I would skip this dish next time. I hate soggy.\n\nI adore taro so I had to order the Spareribs w/ Taro & Bean Curd ($9.99) which was like the clay pot rendition: http://bit.ly/1bvy0sJ. The \"spareribs\" had a meaty texture but definitely tastes like soy protein. Both the taro and bean curd we're perfectly tender. The dish could of used more gravy though.\n\nIf there's one dish that you must order here, it's the Spinach & Pine Nut Fried Ricey ($9 + $1.50 for brown rice): http://bit.ly/1eJQc1L. It's a tad pricey for a veggie rice dish but it's absolutely delicious! The rich, crunchy nuttiness of the pine nuts just makes this dish really stand out.\n\nThe food was a solid 4 stars but I'm giving an extra star for the ultra-friendly and lightning fast service. We received our soup within minutes of ordering and our entire order in less than 5 minutes. It was packed on a Saturday night too. Gotta love the two pump chump service...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

How do you run out of something before you even open for dinner? It was the middle of the week too. The waitress recommended we try the vegetarian dumplings instead, which were terrible. It tasted like the vegetables from the inside of an eggroll, but stuffed into a dumpling. The shark fin soup was bland (although I'm told by vegetarian standards, it was pretty tasty). The most disgusting thing was when my friend said that the pickled vegetables were moving. There was a bug crawling around in it. I later realized that there were fruit flies flying everywhere around us. \n\nThe saving grace dish was the eggplant and sea bass. I loved the imitation sea bass, which was made from soy wrapped with nori. I like the texture of how the soy was cooked and the eggplant was delicious as well.

You get your choice of white or brown rice.\n\nString beans and veggie chicken: the string beans, well, are standard string beans.  The veggie chicken had a salty, somewhat spongy texture like Spam.  I like spam, so this was fine with me.  But I wouldn't say it was that close to chicken.\n\nChinese satay sauce with cuttlefish and basil: the cuttle fish is pretty interesting.  It was a bit chewy; this dish was not for me.\n\nEggplant and soy sea bass: the egg plant was oily and really soft (as usual with Chinese restaurants); each piece of eggplant absorbed a lot of the sauce, which was pretty good.  The sea bass was probably the weirdest part of the dining experience.  It was fishy- yet, I kept on thinking, how could this be fishy, if it's not fish?  I am not sure if I like it or not.\n\nWe also got one order of chicken wings.  These had a smoky flavor to them, which for me, is a no-no.  I really don't care for smokiness.  My friends seemed to enjoy these quite a bit though.  The chicken texture is surprisingly accurate.  They are fried \"chicken\" drummettes with sweet and sour sauce.  An order of 4 costs $6.99.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty interesting experience.  I'm not sure if I'd go back, because nothing really was that stand out to me.  I feel like I don't really enjoy the fake meat as much as the real stuff.  I can see why others may like it, but just a-ok in my opinion.  Good, but not amazing.  The service was casual and slow at times, but it was fine.", "author": "Samantha L."}

So the Manabu-San Trifecta of inexpensive, creatively tasty food and very caring service is still mostly intact.

Usually I prioritize food, service, then cost.  In this case no sacrifices had to be made.  Enjoy Vegetarian is not gourmet fine dining, but it is good fresh tasty food. \n\nIf you really like onions and garlic you might be disappointed here, the flavors are much more subtle and the vegetable flavors really come through.  Personally I found this a huge plus, I hate it when onions are used as a shortcut to flavor, and it turns out that I'm exceedingly allergic to alliums anyways.  It was really nice to be able to order anything without worrying about it.  \n\nBesides that the food was just good, not oily, not salty, just some good vegetables and bean curd cooked together.  The black sticky rice dessert was really delicious, perfectly cooked with coconut milk and not too sweet.  Everything about this meal was a good experience.  The service was so fast we never had to wait for a waiter for anything, and the food came out super fast.  No one ever seemed rushed or stressed.  The servers were speedy but so friendly and kind, they really added to our enjoyment of the meal.   \n\nIf you like strongly flavored food, you will probably want to discuss this with the waiter, because the food we had was on the plainer side.  We liked this, but even we found the lotus dish a little plain, mostly because the lotus had a sort of bland taste.  I like lotus, so I didn't really mind, but I could see this being a negative for someone used to stronger flavored food.  \n\nBe aware that Enjoy Vegetarian is mostly vegan but not completely, so let the server know if you are vegan.  It seemed like they could make pretty much anything vegan, they had vegan ice cream to sub for the dairy in the desserts, which was the only obviously non vegan thing on the menu.\n\nThe menu is not labeled as to which dishes are gluten free, but one of the servers was very knowledgeable and helped us order. \n\nP.S.  Parking is surprisingly hard!  This is one of those SF neighborhoods packed with driveways and cars in every piece of curb.  No lots at any price nearby either.\n\nP.P.S.

If you can, go with 2 or 3 people so you can order a ton of stuff, as the menu is unbelievably varied (fake meats, tofu, vegetables, dim sum, soups, noodles, rice dishes) and you'll want to try a bunch of stuff. Most important for me, however: there is bean curd skin, aka yuba, (in some places it's known as vegetarian Peking Duck, due to the crunchy, skin-like texture) used in a bunch of dishes.\n\nIt had been several days since I had eaten a nutritious meal. I'm the kind of vegetarian who doesn't do well if I don't get a large portion of actual vegetables (preferably some greens in there) on a daily basis and on this particular day, I had been on and off of planes and into three airports for the majority of it, so as is typical for me when traveling, all I had consumed was a pretzel and coffee. \n\nSo, there I was, craving some fresh, healthy, dare I say *alive* food, something awful (I've been known to look at inedible plants and leaves and start drooling. I know... how glamorous of me).  I was dining alone, but decided to pretend like I had another person with me, because I just couldn't decide on what to order.\n\nMy imaginary dining partner and I settled on lotus root, one of my favorites and not so easy to come by in my current city, and the salt and pepper fried tofu, based on the recommendation of my trusted fellow yelpers, in addition to a bean curd skin and vegetable stir fry.\n\nOh. My. Flavor and texture sensation commenced... I may have blacked out. Details, I know you want 'em: salt and pepper tofu is lightly fried and seasoned simply with salt and pepper. And it's delicious. Lotus root came sauteed with a light sauce, also perfect, as was the chewy, slightly sour and salty bean curd skin. Due to the black out, that's all I can remember at this time. Of course I appreciated the hot chili oil/flakes to make things extra spicy, as is my tendency. \n\nEyes bigger than stomach syndrome plus no fridge= sad, wasteful me. And that imaginary dining companion? Useless. Go with someone real, people!\n\nJust some notes: No liquor, no ambiance, so not really a special occasion place, but sometimes you all you need is an enormous, nourishing and delicious meal.", "author": "Joi B."}

She flat out refused, her excuse being that those tables all had reservations that were due soon. I found out she lied to me about those tables being reserved when a party of 3 walked in and she asked them how big their party was before seating them at one of the 'open but reserved'  tables. They didn't give her a name for a reservation, it was obvious they showed up as walk - ins. As she seated them she glanced my way to find that i caught her in a lie and she quickly looked away.

Our group had the chicken curry, the chow mien, dumplings, and the tofu and eggplant.  Everything was really good, but I would definitely get the chicken curry and tofu and eggplant again.  I don't think it tasted like chicken...it tasted like setian which is what it was.  Like a fake meat made with wheat gluten and other spices.  However, it was really flavorful and they gave you a large portion.  I like eating veggies, not too into the fake meat thing...but once in a while it's good.  And I understand a lot of people may like that as well.\n\nMy husband and friend who were with me loved it.  We were so full but we still had leftovers!  I would definitely come back here on my next visit.", "author": "Heather W."}

Oh yeah, all the meats are soy based, take that as you will. We ended up ordering a dumpling appetizer, thai soup (which is a tom yum base), eggplant with \"sea bass\" and singapore-style noodles. \n\nI have to say that I wasn't really expecting much from this place, but everything was quite good. I even like the dumplings and I hate eating dumplings. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the Singapore noodles were very tasty. The food was all nicely portioned. We finished everything and felt just appropriately full. Also I think you have to order rice separately if you want it, FYI (I'm not used to that coming from the south where you get your rice for free).\n\nOur waitress was funny and appropriately attentive. Also the food is reasonably priced. We ordered an appetizer, a small soup (which serves 2-3) and 2 main dishes, and with tax and tip it came out to $40.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-22", "description": "\"Dishes served do not contain garlic, onion and MSG. Immitation meat are made of soy product, yam, or wheat gluten\" - says Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant. This philosophy also adheres to the strict Buddhist vegan diet, where it is believed that garlic and onion (for example) stirs up unwanted things in the body (or provide un-necessary bloodflow to the nether regions).\n \nBah, so it's gonna taste flavor-free or shideous, you are probably thinking.\n\nWell you'll be mildly surprised. SF Bay Area folks have got it good. You can go low tech and make your own salad at home with certified organic produce from your upscale farmers market (or Trader Joe if you're on the el cheapo). Or if you feel like spending green to eat green, there's Millenium, Greens, and of course Ubuntu, and a myriad of other raw food slow food type choices.\n\nBut if you are of the A$N per$ua$ion, it's slim pickins for Vegetarian Chinese, unless you're a member of a Buddhist temple. Lucky Creation in Chinatown is an excellent place, but it's a different niche, a bit more downscale Cantonese vegetarian that does more stir fry. Ming's on Taraval offers great vegetarian versions of Canto dishes, but they share the same kitchen that serves meat and seafood. There's really no good Taiwanese vegan/vegetarian around, and Sogo Tofu in San Jose is not even a restaurant. R&G Lounge's vegetarian/soy abalone is like $18, but that's one dish, and you don't know what's in their magic sauce, as good and as overpriced it may be.\n\nThis is where Enjoy comes in. Even volunteers and members of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (NorCal chapter, out of Taiwan) swear by this place (I know, because they directed us here!)\n\nAs much as I wanted some starch and bovine in soup at San Tung, an overdose of meat products earlier in the week required a change of pace for this one meal, and EV was pretty much the no brainer.\n\nEV is run by Hong Kongers and is more or less considered Vegetarian Cantonese, despite the menu having vegetarian versions of American Chinese, Sichuan, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hakka Cantonese. You may find similar things as your local PF Panda Chow, but why go there?\n\nHere we go:\n\nCombination platter (all made in house items) - $6, not good value at all for such a small portion\nsoy goose - not bad. But not as decadent as some Shanghainese restos\nsoy chasiu - eeeehhhh, why bother. A hint of sweet and sour. Why not use molasses or honey like the real porker?\ntofu strips (dou-gan) - I've had better\nsweet and sour wheat gluten - good gluten texture, but sweet and sour sauce was not so good.\n\nDrumstick with sweet and sour sauce - the worst item of the evening. Do not get this thinking that it tastes like fried chicken. I'm sure those soy hot dogs taste a whole lot better. The SS sauce didn't help either. The soy drumstick we had at a friend's wedding at a Vietnamese Buddhist temple in San Jose easily blew this one away.\n\nBean Curd Rolls w/vegetable (stuffed with cabbage and mushroom) - this is #90 on the menu. NOW WE ARE TALKIN' AND BACK ON TRACK. A tad bit too salty, but this is truly authentic good Cantonese, even if entirely vegetarian. Supposedly 101 through 104 are also very good (those with mushroom dishes). This plate saved the entire meal. $8.50, but very well executed\n\nSpinach and pine nut fried rice (#120 on the menu) - most folks get the House Special Fried Rice, but this was off the beaten path, and it ended up being very tasty. How did they do it? Not greasy at all, and yet quite flavorful. No MSG, no garlic, no butter, no Benihana grill, what was the formula? I could only guess, maybe mushroom powder essence for flavoring. The major drawback....lots of inconsistent undercooked grains of rice (or old rice). But this was easily solved by pouring #90 dish's magic sauce over the rice.\n\nVegetarian won ton with mixed veg udon - would not have ordered this otherwise, but if you have a kid who didn't like the soy fried chicken and prefers noodles, this might save the day. Just as I had guessed, a mushroom based broth. The wontons had finely minced up veg and tofu inside. Overall a very forgettable bowl, but palatable. I was lamenting paying $8 for this, when I could have spent it on THIS\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTNzezUyNYw\n\nFree plate of very juicy and sweet oranges when we got the bill. However other tables got a small portion of pai tsai or pickled vegetable appetizers, but we never got it.\n\n3.5 stars in reality. Rounding up to a very very overly generous 4.", "author": "Ken K."}

The food is vegan (except for the mayonnaise on the walnut \"prawns\", and I'm not sure why they don't use vegan mayo), and everything is cooked without MSG, garlic, or onions.\n\nIt freaked me out the first time I ate at Enjoy, because everything tasted so good.  The walnut \"prawns\" are a must to order, and I actually prefer them to the real thing.  It's faux-shrimp, but they're the same shape and color as real shrimp, the texture is tender, and the flavor is delicious.  \n\nThe \"chicken\" tastes pretty good also.  I've had the chicken nuggets as well as the sweet and sour chicken, which were both surprisingly good.  The soup dumpling were a new addition the last time I went, and those were full of flavor and had just the right texture.  The fried rice, spinach and pine nut as well as the house special, were both good, but I prefer the latter as opposed to most reviewers who seem to prefer the former.  The only dud for me was the tomato \"beef\" chow mein.

I am a lifetime vegetarian and foodie and am especially fond of, but at the same time critical of Chinese food. Most of it is hideously greasy and salty, and covered in garlicky MSG laden corn starch/syrup sauce. \n\nWe had their 68 dollar 8 item special. As many have stated, the aromatic crispy chicken is delicious. A touch too heavy on the salt, but it is an appetizer. Personal favorite - the walnut prawns! Omg! My wife who is newly vegetarian says they are so close to the real thing on texture it's incredible. I only know they tasted incredible. They actually offer a lot of their meat free items uncooked to go, to take with you to prepare at home. We scored a couple bags of the \"prawns\". They hit that dish out of the park. \n\nNext favorite - the Eggplant & Sea Bass. The eggplant in this was absolutely perfect - delicious flavor, not too greasy, succulent. My wife called dibs on the leftovers on that one. \n\nThe other especially memorable dish was the chicken sweet and sour. Quite delish. \n\nI will definitely come here again. The I interior was a little dingy, and I thought they were just a little heavy on the salt overall, which together cost them a star. But the staff was very friendly!

The flavour in this dish was sweet, spiced, redolent of basil, with extremely convincing fake beef.  I've rarely had such a subtly-flavored delightful dish in a chinese restaurant, and I'd order this again (and again, and again).\n\nTotal cost of these five dishes plus 3 rice?  $43 after tax.

The tables always seem a bit small to me, but that might be because we tend to over-order so that we can take home left overs.  My only real complaint about the experience at their tables is that the napkins they use always seem to just dissolve in your hands and in my experience are worthless about 1/2 way through your meal.\n\nThe food here is like my version of guilt-free comfort food.

The menu said it will serve 2-3 ppl, but between the 2 of us, we had 3 bowls (rice bowl size) each.  It is generously-portioned.\n\n2/  Eggplant and Sea Bass - we picked this from everyone's recommendation here.  I thought it was very clever to use seaweed to wrap around the gluten to make it taste like fish.  It is good - I would recommend it, but it is my least favorite of the 3 we ordered.  The dish is on a oily side, but I think it's typical whenever you order eggplant, anywhere.\n\n3.  Pepper steak with Veggies - absolutely love this!  It didn't taste like beef per se, but still good nonetheless.  The sauce was excellent and very tasty!!\n\nService is standard.  Dishes came out accordingly. \n\nThey gave us the taro/coconut tapioca for dessert.  This is perhaps the most disappointing for all... the dessert was luke warm and it was not sweet enough.  But since it's free, we can't really complain.\n\nDishes range around $8.50 each.  It is on the high side compared to other Chinese restaurants, but it is still cheap compare to other cuisines.

I also really enjoyed the Eggplant and Sea Bass (the eggplant more!), (which I read was a favorite of a lot of Yelpers) was exquisite!  I wasn't much of a fan of the \"Sea Bass\", and I couldn't figure out of it was because of the nori/seaweed wrapped around it (probably to give it that \"fishy\" taste), or because the texture was so believable close to fish texture!!

The reason is the same: don't harm living things. But the cuisines vary greatly. Japanese vegetarianism, exemplified by Cha-Ya, is all about restraint, simplicity, and enjoying the taste of vegetables. Chinese vegetarianism, however, is all about the faux-meat. \n\nSorta like the 5 stages of grief where you lost the ability to eat meat. Chinese vegetarianism is in the denial stage: I am still eating meat! Really, it looks like meat, it tastes like meat, it must be meat. Meanwhile, Japanese vegetarianism reached the acceptance stage: I am at peace with no more meat; I accept veggies for who they are and I accept that they don't taste like meat, and will never be meat. \n\nNow I have digressed far enough, let's talk about Enjoy. It's a great Chinese vegetarian restaurant. Like any Chinese restaurant, the menu is abundant with choices and prices are cheap. You have your selection of veggie stir-fries and then you have your choices of \"meat.\" \n\nWe ordered eggplant seabass and #63 (lotus root, ginkgo nuts, lily bulbs, etc.) Both were delicious. Seabass not only tasted like fish, but the texture and look (fish-like skin) is impressive. \n\nEnjoy doesn't use MSG, garlic or onions. So for them to create tasty dishes, they've got mad skills. \n\nThe service is also super. It's our first time, but you can tell that most diners are regulars.

The total was about $68 for the set (total per person was $14-15). Here's the breakdown of what we got:\n\n-Crispy Chicken- tastes just like boneless chicken, crispy and just right but I think a sauce to dip it in would be nice\n\n-Lettuce Wrapped w/ Shredded Mushroom, Veggie Chicken, Vegetable & Pine Nut- this is my FAVORITE dish of the night. Lettuce wrap is something I'm very accustomed to and I love how filling and delish the stuffing is.. don't forget to use the Hoi Seen sauce that comes with it!! \n\n-Shark Fin Soup- good but slightly bland, texture is similar to the real deal but I do not support eating real fin at all (send me a message if you want to know why).. I added vinegar to my bowl which made it a lot better. \n\n-Spinach & Pine Nut Fried Rice- this is a light but still yummy fried rice, not too much to say about it but honestly I could have plain white rice and it wouldn't make much difference (my boyfriend really liked this fried rice though)\n\n-Sweet & Sour chicken- almost couldn't tell this wasn't real chicken, the flavors are just right but the shell could be a little more crispy\n\n-Chinese Satay Sauce w/ Cuttlefish & Basil- this one is just alright, the satay is too salty for me and I didn't care for the \"cuttlefish\"- the texture of it is surprisingly slippery and crunchy like the real thing though. \n\n-Eggplant w/ Sea Bass- my SECOND FAVORITE. The \"sea bass\" is actually nothing like the texture of the real fish so don't be too disappointed if you don't get that melt-in-your-mouth sensation.. the sea bass in this is actually rather chewy, but if you pay attention closely you'll notice it has some kind of seafood flavoring that gives it a salty fish taste! The sauce and texture of eggplant in this dish is just right. \n\nBean Curd Rolls w/ Vegetable ( stuffed w/ Cabbage, Mushroom)- this is decent, made very well and the little bok choys that came with it were cooked just right.\n\nOVERALL: Lots of options and the food is well-prepared, each unique with its own flavors and textures. Service was very helpful and friendly. I'm happy to have found a decent Chinese vegetarian restaurant that doesn't make me miss not having meat. I learned the owner is vegetarian and the restaurant uses no MSG in their food, that's pretty awesome considering all the right flavors were there (duplicating the real meat-version dishes).

So there I am, sitting there, taking in the smell, looking at the pictures and descriptions on the menu.  I was just stunned...almost every dish was fake meat this and that.  I wanted flavorful vegetables and/or tofu/beancurd.  Plus, the fact that much of the fake meat had gluten alarmed me a bit.  When I then saw that there was no garlic or onion in the dishes, I just started to feel a bit uncomfortable with following through with ordering; I ordered anyway because I had been waiting to try this place for 4 years, and I wanted to give it the benefit of my many doubts...also, there is no egg in the dishes.

I also wasn't loving the texture of the fake meats...  Maybe I should just stick to my one true love, soyrizo (and occasionally Morningstar's Chik'n nuggets - omfg, so good!).\n\nSeeing as other yelpers sing the praises of Enjoy, I am willing to give it another chance.

A group of us (I was the only non-meat eater) went there and we really enjoyed ourselves. One of my friends had eaten there before, and she said we should try their Eggplant&Sea Bass stuff. Fake fish, to me, seems harder to perfect than fake meat. Well, their \"sea bass\" really tasted like fish. And it was good. Impressive. \nI also really liked their \"fake chicken\" fried rice and the crispy \"fake\" chicken. Satisfied me all the way. Their Fatty Pork was just okay, not my favorite. Some things are difficult to fake, I guess.\n\nNot only did I enjoy the food, I also enjoyed the service. Our servers were friendly and helpful. They were happy that we liked their food. They even gave us free dessert, which unfortunately we didn't really care for (it was some kind of a sweet&hot soupy thing). I don't know if they could tell we didn't really like it, but they brought us something else (sweet red bean paste stuff), which we thought was pretty good. I just appreciated their attentiveness and hospitality. \n\nGreat place for both vegetarians and meat-eaters to enjoy. I would go back there anytime. 5 stars for good food and good service.", "author": "Kaoru W."}

The waitress remembered us after just the first time visiting and already knows what we like and gives us recommendations for other dishes. She explains how everything is made and is always helpful. \r\n\r\nI went to Shangri-La for the first time the other Monday because Enjoy was closed.

You MUST get this.  The soup had a nice kick to it and it wasn't very sweet (which is good).  The small portion sizes are enough for 2 people.  The combo appetizer was a mix of various types of gluten (as probably all their food) and good...I loved the one with pine nuts. \n\nBest of all, our entire meal was around $26 before tip & the portions were reasonably big - meaning that i think thought went into the preparation and the portions were disgustingly gigantic and filled with oil & msg.  \n\nThe service was excellent - so sweet and fast!\n\nThe consensus - I enjoyed myself immensely and will be back.", "author": "Helen F."}

While I've simply adjusted to only ever having two to three options on most menus, the thought of being able to choose blindly and get something I could eat always burned in the back of my mind - someday, somewhere, this too could happen to a guy like me. Enter Enjoy. (That came out weird...)\n\nThe place was almost empty on the Monday evening I visited, making it a perfect place to grab a bite by myself. Until of course I was sitting alone facing the biggest range of vegetarian options I had ever seen in my life without anyone to guide my choices, or order my alternates so I could try more without having to be removed via wheelbarrow. Or an elephant-pulled trolley.\n\nI went with the small appetizer platter in order to get more tastes for my buck, followed by the Pai Pa Tofu Balls served on a bed of broccoli, carrots and mushrooms ($16 total bill, more food than I could eat). The server was really friendly, knowledgeable, and happy to weigh in to make sure I wouldn't waste my visit on something I could have anywhere. While I didn't have the guts to go with some of their more faux-meat items (goose, shrimp, beef, chicken - it's all on there), just reading the things they can do with tofu, soy and bean curd blew my mind.\n\nMy appetizer arrived within three minutes of me ordering (I'm serious), and the main dish arrived about eight minutes later. SUPER fast and perfect if you're in a hurry or just not in the mood to be out for hours and hours.\n\nI don't know if I'll be back this trip (lots of other places to pack into a short visit) but I'll definitely keep Enjoy on my radar for future stints on the west coast.

They made the best of it though. \n\nThe service staff tried to be as attentive and fast with the food and service as they could.  They did miss a couple of queues for water and we had to go get it ourselves.  However, they got bonus points for seating our 4 adult and 2 toddler asses without reservation on a very busy night within a very reasonable time.\n\nThen we get to the food.  As many have mentioned, the menu is extensive.  Given that it was my first time there, we were directed by the pretty pictures.  \n\nAnd now.. to the food:\n\n* Veggie Shark's Fin Soup\n- Delicious!\n\n* Combination Platter (Soybean Sheet, BBQ Pork, Tofu, Sweet & Sour Wheat Gluten)\n- This is the one dish that I would not recommend.  All you could taste of the bbq pork was the very sweet bbq sauce, and the sweet & sour wheat gluten was way too sour.  The only item on the list I would recommend is the soybean sheet.\n\n* Drumstick w/Sweet & Sour Sauce for the kids\n- I didn't have any of this but the kids seem to really enjoy it\n\n* Spicy Ma Po Tofu\n- The sauce was on the sweeter side for my taste but not bad\n\n* Taro, Sesame Veggie Chicken Cooked w/ Coconut Sauce\n- Definitely a must-have for taro and coconut lovers.  This was my favorite dish. \n\n* Eggplant w/ Sea Bass\n- Excellent!  Don't know how they do it but the faux-fish was a lot like fish in texture and flavor.

I eat meat like its nobodies business usually, but the food here is pretty close and some of the items, you don't even notice the difference that much.\n\nCame here for dinner around 8 and we ordered off the set menu. The set menu is worth it, if you have a big group. 8 dishes (2 apps/1 soup/4 mains/and a fried rice) for $68 or something like that. The crispy chicken we got was pretty good, didn't taste like chicken, but it was good. It was good enough to fool my 4 year old picky nephew into wanting more though. Got the lettuce wraps... one of my favorite dish, the stuffing that came with it was very flavorful. Got the veggie shark fin soup... wasn't the same as the real thing, but it was pretty good (especially since it'll be banned for sale soon too... the real thing that is). The spinach fried rice was really good, when I first read it on the menu... I wasn't really happy about it. But it was a pretty solid dish. The other 4 dishes, I'm not sure where they are since I don't feel like looking through the entire menu. One of them had lotus root in it and it was pretty good. Another was a mixture... pretty good... but there was a hair in it. Let the waiter know and they apologized and took it to the back and gave us a new one. \n\nOverall, the food here is pretty good. Not the same as meat, but it's a good alternative though, compared to other vegetarian places I've tried... this is by far the best place. It's small inside, but it's clean for a chinese restarant!

Although, it strikes me as hopping on the yuppie bandwagon to call their fake meat Sea Bass, when it could just as well be any other fish, say frozen tilapia, but I guess that doesn't have the same ring to it?\n\nI've had the coconut taro and chicken, which was ultimately uninspiring because the taro was so dry and there wasn't much sauce, I'm a sauce fan, throw on a lot of sauce and let me dredge out my food, that is preferable to something that gives me dry mouth.\n\nThe pepper steak was okay, tasted like oyster sauce, which it probably wasn't.  Looked like the chicken nuggets in the previous dish, except darkened.\n\nThe eggplant sea bass was okay, although nothing to write home about\n\nThe fried curry triangles were good, although I stand by the theory that you can deep fry anything and it would be good.  These I found similar to Yamo's samusa's without the Burmese spices, more standard curry flavor here.  \n\nLastly I always appreciate a nice dessert to follow up the meal, and here it is included, that is always a plus.  It was a red bean soup that was not too sweet and was warm.  Similar to what I would have bought for 3.50 at a dessert shop such as 100% healthy desserts.  \n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Well, I felt it was average, for my money I prefer Golden Lotus in Oakland, but I'd go back to give them another try as the lemon chicken looked interesting.  Also the kung pao chicken seemed like it would be good (the other table had it).", "author": "Stephen H."}

As John S. commented to me, the apricot-painted walls make it seem like there should be more ice cream, and less Chinese food. In my opinion, they spend more time on the food, and less on the decorations.

I have to start off by making it clear that I am by all means NOT a vegetarian, and I love meat -very much so!  I want to make this known, before taking the plunge.\n\nMy best friend and I have never before eaten at a vegetarian friendly restaurant.  Our expectations were low, I will admit.  I've been by this place many times, but never gave it the time of day.  We decided to take a deep breath, and pull up our boots, on the recommendation of another friend of mine.  This place quite simply blew our socks off.\n\nWalking in, there are three things you immediately notice.  One -this place is really clean, and well lit.  Two -this place is kind of small.  Three -the staff here is really friendly.\n\nWe ordered the Combination Platter (appetizer), Sweet & Sour Chicken, and the House Special Chow Mein.  \n\nThe \"combo-platter\" was delightful.  I was almost afraid to see what these meat imitating foods would taste like.  I now have a new found respect for soy products, yams, and wheat gluten.  Divine.  The flavors of all the different foods on this platter contrasted exceptionally well with one another -this actually applies to all of the dishes we ordered.\nFor two adults, I would recommend getting the large platter, instead of the small.  A nice preview of what was to come.\n\nSweet & Sour Chicken.  It also came adorned with carrots, and green bell peppers.  The carrots were nice and soft, not to be mistaken for mushy.  The bell peppers (which I normally don't eat) were fantastic.  At many other chinese restaurants, the bell peppers tend to be soggy with a drowned out taste.  But not here!  These bell peppers were done right.  Still slightly stiff/crunchy.  You benefit from the original taste of the bell pepper, AND the sweet and sour sauce.  I'd give it three thumbs up, unfortunately I only have two ;)\n\nHouse Special Chow Mein.  This dish was prepared better than any chinese restaurant I have been to.  The chow mein here was not bland in taste, and not lathered in oil and grease.  It went down easy, and had great taste!  The combination of mushrooms, vermicelli, bean sprouts, and others ingredients made for a mad flurry of outrageous flavor.  \n\nFor dessert you choose between papaya soup, or oranges.  Curious to see how the soup was, we went for it.  It was great.  It had fresh papaya, almonds, and and another ingredient I didn't recognize.  My friend doesn't like papaya fruit, but this soup turned him around and gave him a smack in the bee-hind!  Perfection in a bowl boys and girls.  Perfection.\n\nSo for two people, it ran us $26 plus tip.  The prices are a little higher than at say, some other places to dine for similar foods, but only by a couple dollars, really.  Definitely worth a try -I am positive you will not be let down.\n\nThe staff was very nice, and very accommodating.  As a quick aside however, this place is small.  Almost cramped -but still cozy.  Go there early to get a table.  Also parking isn't exactly ideal; I had to circle the block a couple times.  No parking lot, just street parking.  \nVegetarian or not, ch-ch-ch-check it out, and ENJOY VEGETARIAN!\n\nThis place will definitely see me again, and they definitely have my patronage.  If I go somewhere to eat and I am \"just satisfied,\" it is really only four stars to me.  In order for any place of business to get a five star rating from me, they need to exceed the standard.  This place did just that.  Thus I can say BAM Five stars.", "author": "Anthony L."}

You can also request that the dishes be cooked with no oil and/or no salt.\n\nI take back what I said about serving fake shark fin soup below. Actually it would be great if restaurants serving shark fin offer this vegetarian alternative, and people would start ordering it once they realize it's better for their health. Shark's cartilage was traditionally thought to have some cancer-fighting properties, but given the amount of pollution in the ocean, now it actually causes cancer and sterility (mercury is a neural toxin harmful to the brain and nervous system, and sharks have the most mercury which builds up in their system as they're at the top of the food chain). People who like eating seafood consume too much mercury already. \n\nEven though my family's favorite cuisine is Chinese, I don't go to any restaurants that serve shark's fin and it's perfectly fine because there are so many choices in the Bay Area. Top of my list of favorite restaurants to bring relatives is Enjoy. Others cuisines my relatives like are Vietnamese (Slanted Door, Out the Door, Ana Mandera), Japanese (Koo, Delica, Ebisu, ... list is too long), Thai (Marnee), Indonesian (Borobudur), and Asian fusion restaurants like Chaya, Pomelo. Of course my favorite is still Chinese (I love stir-fry Chinese vegetables -- all the varieties!) and I go to places that don't serve shark's fin, such as Enjoy.\n\nRelated shark-fin links:\nNice photos of swimming with sharks http://www.sharkwater.com/production_gallery_3.htm\nMany sharks are facing extinction including the cool hammerhead http://posthumananimal.blogspot.com/2009/06/no-shark-fin-card.html\nYao Min is against eating shark's fin http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/15/blogophile/main1895755.shtml\nEating shark's fin is out of vogue among young Asians http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/InNews/vogue2009.html\nAng Lee made a PSA with WildAid against shark finning http://www.wildaid.org/index.asp?CID=7&PID=507 Other people endorsing WildAid include Zhang ZiYi, Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung, Chow Yuen Fatt, Lisa Ling, Michelle Yeoh, Joan Chen, Tony Leung... http://www.wildaid.org/index.asp?CID=7&PID=479", "author": "Yvonne C."}

No dinner combinations.\n\nI was looking for a healthy dinner while trying to wait out traffic before heading home, and yelp led me here.  I am a meat eater (steaks as bloody rare as possible), but after trying the amazing vegetarian soul food over at Souley Vegan in Oakland, I am no longer opposed to trying more meat free options.\n\nThe menu is very extensive, and it was hard to believe that everything offered wasn't real meat.  I wanted to try a few different imitation meats, but unfortunately there didn't seem to be any combos offered for dinner.   I went with the Salt and Pepper Fried Squid ($6.99), the Shanghai Bean Curd Sauce Braised Lamb with Dried Bean Curd & Vegetable ($8.50), and the House Special Chow Mein with BBQ Pork and Veggie Ham ($7.50).\n\nThe squid came quickly, and it looked just like fried calamari!  Quite impressive on the visual, but I was sure there was no way it could taste right.  After my first bite, I knew I would never doubt good vegetarian restaurants again.  It was delicious!  It had the exact same texture as squid (slightly rubbery and slippery) and the taste was on point too!  The waitress told me it was made out of yam, but it must have been some kind of yam I had never had before.  Amazing!  I wolfed the rest down.\n\nNext came the chow mein.  After the squid I was very excited to see how the bbq pork turned out, but it wasn't quite as good an imitation.  Visually it was spot on, but it definitely didn't taste much like bbq pork.  Not that it was bad, it was still very good, you could just tell it was made with tofu and maybe some mushroom.  Tasted very much like traditional chow mein with less oil.\n\nThe braised lamb... insanity.  It looked dead on like meat, and tasted like meat.  It didnt quite have the full lamb flavor, but it definitely tasted like meat.  The texture was dense and a bit chewy, spot on.  Excellent dish.  All the veggies were fresh, flavors crisp and distinct, just the right amount of salt.  I ended up bringing some of it to work the next day, and a couple of my coworkers tried it and couldn't believe it wasnt really meat.\n\nOverall, the meal was excellent.  It was very satisfying, and somehow healthy AND enjoyable.  What makes things extra crazy is they dont use ANY garlic or onions here, in any dish.  Those are my two favorite things to add in everything I cook, but somehow they can pull it off.  I will definitely be back soon to try out other meats, like fatty pork.", "author": "Jon B."}

The restaurant is on the smaller size, but we went after the dinner rush and were seated immediately.  They have a rather large menu for a vegetarian place, and it's a plus that they cater to the Buddhist vegetarian style (i.e., no garlic or onions, etc.).  Our server brought us a nice pot of tea and gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu.  We ordered steamed dumplings for appetizer and shared Singapore vermicelli noodles, Kung Pao \"Chicken\" with broccoli and peppers, plus a bowl of mixed wild rice.  The dumplings were okay, but nothing to rave about.  They were on the small side, and tasted similar to the type of vegetarian dumplings you'd find in the frozen section of an Asian grocery store.  The Kung Pao Chicken was the best dish out of the two we ordered.  The soy \"chicken\" was crispy and actually tasted similar to chicken, both in texture and flavor.  The dish was very flavorful with just enough spiciness and not overly salty.  The Singapore vermicelli noodles were also good, but I've had better back home in NY.  Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive, stopping by to ask how the flavor of our food was, filling our glasses with water, etc.  Overall, a great experience and I will definitely be returning to try out the other items on their menu!", "author": "Rebecca W."}

Crappy meat turned out to be simply not an option.  Even previous \"luxury\" side meats like bacon with my scrambled eggs or on my cobb salad became an unacceptable choice for my meat day.   Fast food meat became unthinkable.  My meat days slow began to be elevated to the level of holiday feasts, where only the finest quality was selected.  \n\nBut there always came a time during the rest of the week, where I still needed a fix...err...I mean where I still had a craving for meat, and I finally found a faux-meat restaurant that satisfied.

It's inexpensive, meaning that I can order more delicious dishes. Two entrees, plus soup, was enough food for my boyfriend and I and lunch for me the next day, and the bill was only $22 without tip.\r\n\r\n3. The service was super friendly and so fast, and also featured a set of cute old Chinese grandparents who may or may not be the owners. In my little fantasy world, however, they run the place (and maybe Grandma cooks), while their children and/or grandchildren serve as kitchen and waitstaff. \r\n\r\n4. Instead of fortune cookies, they serve you jelly bean candies and refreshing watermelon slices for dessert, which is somehow the perfect ending to the meal. \r\n\r\nThere are so many good restaurants in SF that I usually almost feel guilty going to the same place twice, but I'm already plotting my next meal here.", "author": "Rachel J."}

Even on a beautiful sunny day they have like 20 1000watt lights all at full blast.  It is brighter inside this restaurant than it is outside.  The only thing I can sort of compare this too is when you go to the optometrist to have an eye exam and they put the drops in your eyes and send you out with some flakey wrap around sunglasses.  You go outside you are hit with the intense, unbearable light....that is sort of the feeling you get inside here... I can only think they do this to wave off the appearance that it is a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, which when driving by one might think, but it doesn't work because that is exactly what I did for years.\n\nOK I know that was very whiney and probably think I'm one of those unhappy people who go around complaining about how people drive crazy and children making too much noise or the neighbor's dog and everything that approaches them, I'm not though.  I just see this problem as intensely un-enjoyable....\"oh there he goes again  whah whah whah\"\n\nBut that aside, let's get to the good: Enjoy Vegetarian is tucked away in a residential neighborhood that adds to its charm, it is sort of like going to someone's living room for a meal.  They have a very extensive menu of faux meat dishes and vegetarian items that are absolutely delicious.  To top it all off the people who work here are so tremendously nice.  Just bring your darkest shaded sunglasses and wear them while eating vegetarian food inside the restaurant (you'll look cool, or maybe like a heroin addict).", "author": "G L."}

I was so hongree after the gym (gotta plug the workout) and didn't care where we ate as long as we ate, so I gave little fuss when they both talked about Enjoy Vegetarian. \n\nIt was pretty empty when we got there so we were seated promptly.  However, by the end, the place was packed and the two large lazy susan tables were full.\n\nStarted out with the hot and sour soup, very good, just like your regular Chinese restaurant; this is the few rare times that I actually like bamboo shoots.  Got the fried samosas, which were also tasty and flavorful.\n\nWe ordered, the Bok Choy, w/ tofu and mustard greens, excellent dish, I always marvel at how Chinese restaurants manage to keep incredibly large chunks of soft tofu whole without crumbling or breaking apart.  This was a very light and fresh dish, I went to town on it.\n\nThe Curry tofu, not a fan of at all.  I like the tofu they used, that really firm kind that has a robustness about it but that was it.  I thought the sauce was a little too thick and goopy, I had to scrape the excess curry sauce from my tofu chunks.  Another downer, our clay pot bowl was chipped so I ended up chewing on a piece of ceramic pot that got mixed in with the food.  Not pleasant.  However, the wait staff was extremely apologetic about it, offered to give a new dish of something else (we just asked for it to be put in a new bowl) and they comped us for the dish.  \n\nAll in all, very good, minus a star cause of the ceramic episode but don't let that deter you.  Check it out.  Didn't try any of the faux meat though. I've realized that if I'm going to eat meat, I won't it real, none of this fake stuff, so if I'm going veggie, it's veggies and tofu.\n\nThe staff was very accommodating, helpful with ordering, and provided good service.  I would go again.\n\nOn a side note, Enjoy doesn't use any garlic in their cooking.  Of course we wondered why, so I googled it and found that Buddhist people do not eat \"the Five Pungent Spices\" which are onions, scallions, chives, garlic, and the elusive number 5 spice, which according to the web could be either leeks or mushrooms.

Has the look and feel of a relatively new place. My server was extremely friendly and helpful about the menu, giving recommendations and descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe Fragrant Crispy Chicken has such a pleasingly meaty texture that I had to check twice to make sure it was faux chik. The Wonton Soup is a bit bland and the wontons could do with tastier filling, nothing a good  faux beef or prawn couldn't fix! The Eggplant with Sea Bass was one of the more flavorful dishes and they did a good job with the soy-based fish. Last, but not least, I tried a Mustard Greens with Pork Chow Mein, pan-fried style is a must, and this I truly did \"enjoy.\" The crisp, light noodles slowly became soaked in the sauce and crunched satisfyingly in my mouth. The faux pork and greens were good additions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-19", "description": "I enjoyed Enjoy Vegetarian very much.  My fallback vegan restaurant tends to be Golden Lotus in Oakland's Chinatown -- close to home -- but GL has a Vietnamese bent, and sometimes I just want my Chinese classics.  Enjoy Vegetarian has solid Chinese classics like Hot and Sour Soup (sans egg), Kung Pao (faux) Chicken, Lettuce Wraps with (faux) Chicken and Pork.\n\nPoint for point, Golden Lotus has been a more delicious restaurant over the years.  My reservation with Enjoy Vegetarian is that -- like so many other vegetarian restaurants in this class (the now-closed Bok Choy Garden and perhaps the also-closed Layonna as well), it doesn't use garlic or onion.  Golden Lotus does.  There is an element of aroma as well as flavor that is missing from food that does not contain garlic greatness or onion awesomeness.  It's certainly a clean taste -- no MSG either (thank god) -- but could be elevated with the addition of those bulbous beauties I love so much.\n\nThat said, there is much to like about Enjoy Vegetarian.  EV has a Hot & Sour Wonton Soup, and I have to admit that EV's wontons are the best I've had at any vegan restaurant (even better than GL's).  They are the most authentic, most satisfying wontons in the business.  The lettuce wraps are fantastic.  You can't get Kung Pao at GL or several other Vietnamese-leaning places (including Golden Era), so it's nice to have those classic options as well (though, as of yet, I haven't tried the Kung Pao because I've been too intrigued by other Chinese dishes that I can't get elsewhere.  I've also feared that such missionary-position standards might disappoint whereas some of the more creative dishes, at least up to now, haven't).\n\nEnjoy Vegetarian always seems to be busy, and part of that is because I'm typically going on a Sunday.  On my last visit, my wait was uncomfortably long because there were several large families consuming space in the dining room for lengthy periods even after their meals were complete.  One of the families who was sitting next to us, we discovered, were related to the family who owns Enjoy Vegetarian.  Given the traffic and the wait times at such a peak Sunday hour, I found that curious.  The restaurant is so small -- seats, perhaps, 30 people at most -- why would a table for eight spend 2-1/2 hours in primetime?  They didn't even pay (which is how we discovered their relation).  Be forewarned:  there are a lot of larger families who eat there, and seating for small tables of 2 or 4 are limited.\n\nAnother time, I arrived at 2:20p for lunch (they allegedly close at 2:30p), and they refused to serve me.  So, I wouldn't expect to order if one technically arrives close-to-but-before the closing hour, as it seems that they start winding down a bit before the posted times.  This is not to say that the restaurant is empty, but rather, they don't want to start cooking or taking new orders near those posted times.\n\nParking near Enjoy Vegetarian can be tough.\n\nThe three-star review is a combination of the hassle factor with Enjoy Vegetarian combined with the lack of onion and garlic.  I wish the restaurant were bigger.  I wish it were easier to get in-and-out of.  I wish the wait times were shorter.  If so -- even with the same food -- I'd probably give it four stars.  For now, I'm going to stick to three.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Also, I eat my share of burritos al pastor and I smother cold cereal with honey; this is a omniovore's opinion.\n\nThe food at Enjoy Vegetarian is exemplary of its culinary constraints and respectful to its Buddist tradition.\n\nEnjoy Vegetarian is one of the few restaurants I frequent and it is a rare treasure to have in the Inner Sunset. The tranquil atmosphere of the establishment is as cozy as the paint scheme and the ambiance is devoid and absent of the loud, obnoxious sort who would commonly buy into the ethical menu at EV.\n\nSo, what's available? Why..everything. Fish, pork, steak, the usual suspects of vegetables, and then a cornucopia of yam leaves and Asian vegetables you probably wouldn't find at most Chinese restaurants that have been Americanized into MSG-intensity or non-MSG banality for the pallette. \n\nWithout a single pang of fear, order any item and be excited by the textures and flavors utilized in mushrooms, gluten, taro, tofu, and various roots to reinvent the dishes that are mundane and too easily ruined at buffet lines and in over-priced restaurants with sticky floors. The main entrees do not stuff you so much (nor coat your veins with oil to the degree) that you cannot consider the dessert menu; order the mung bean.\n\nAs far as entrees go: Sea Bass with Eggplant is king.

Somehow, somewhere, Enjoy couldn't deliver a tasty meal, but a meal wrought by uninspiring flavors and weird aftertastes.\n\nOur dishes included eggplant with fake meat, fake sizzling beef, Singaporean noodles, and soup -- each dish bordering the line of mediocrity. Glowing reviews can say what they want, but when I tried their meats, there was nothing special about them. While the fake-meat texture was passable as the real thing, the spices used were a little funky. Maybe too funky. After the meal, I suffered from an acute case of gas bloating. Farting. (And no, I don't have a weak stomach for soy-based products; ive been conditioned to fake-meat. Case in point: Meekong's fake duck. Yum!)\n\nOh well.

Made reservations for Sun night at 6pm was no problem, 2 large tables and 5 smaller tables, half the place had the Buddist monks, they were pretty chill and quiet for a large party.\n     Even thought the menu lists beef, chicken, etc everything is vegetarian.  We stayed away from the meat substitutes, from the reviews it sounds like they are more for vegetarians who miss eating meat.\n      Started off with the spring rolls = yum!\n      Medicine soup = just okay, I was able to \"perform\" that night so maybe it worked?  there were some inedible roots and unknown twig thingies in it, not for the non-adventurous.\n      The tofu and veggie curry went great with the brown rice.  We also tried the lotus, ginko, and mushroom was interesting and tasty.\n      The fried rice dishes looked very interesting, but for $9 did not seem to be worth it for a rice dish, so we passed, the brown rice was just fine.\n      Dessert was the rice doughballs rolled in peanut powder (takes about 10 min to prepare) was a typical asian ending to a great meal and went home with left overs!  sorry no fortune cookies, it's not that kind of chinese restaurant.\n     Under $50 with tax and tip included for 2 people around the Inner Sunset area is fantastic!", "author": "David K."}

Ambiance=not so much, service=interesting, a little bit of a language barrier, but the food was good. \n\nWe started off with the fried taro appetizer which had a good flavor but I wasn't a huge fan of the mushiness. It would be better if they cut the taro instead of mashing it. For entrees we had the Mongolian beef, honey walnut prawns, and chicken curry fried rice (all vegetarian dishes). I liked all of them but the general consensus was that the faux shrimp -  honey walnut prawns were the best. \n\nFor dessert we had sesame balls which were really good. I ordered a side of coconut ice cream which I don't recommend unless you actually want vanilla because that's what it tastes like. Overall, some things were better than others.

I'm the only vegetarian, so ordinarily we do not go to vegetarian restaurants, but once a year, on my birthday, I get to pick the place where we eat , and they are resigned to eating a meal without their beloved meat. They hope they'll be able to find something that they can tolerate for one meal. Well, not anymore. \n\nTonight, I wasn't the only person excited about my food. Nor was I the only person to mention the idea of coming back to try some of the dishes that we didn't get to. We were slightly less than thrilled with the BBQ pork appetizer (it was on the cold and soggy side), although the taste was good and my boyfriend greatly enjoyed the \"texture,\" but that was more than made up for by the utter deliciousness of all the food that followed. \n\nEverything was delicious, but three stood out as being extraordinary. First was the taro and chicken with coconut sauce, which, if you love both taro and coconut sauce as much as I do, you will love a LOT (the vegetarian chicken is also delicious). Second, we got the eggplant and sea bass because it was mentioned in so many reviews, and believe me, it lives up to the hype. Some of us thought this was the best dish we got. Others thought the braised spare ribs with dai kon was the best. Bottom line: it was all good, and most of it was excellent.\n\nIn addition, the food all came very quickly after we ordered it, and the staff was very nice. They gave us each a free sweet soup-type thing for dessert. Although the restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, it was a good thing we made a reservation, because it filled up pretty quickly after we were seated. \n\nSomeday soon, we will be making a reservation here again, and probably again soon after that. And after we've worked our way through the entire menu, we will start over again.", "author": "Rachel G."}

And let me tell you, I was about to get back in my car and drive the hell away! NO ONIONS OR GARLIC?? Where's the FLAVOR?\n\nBUT we were hungry and wanted to try out some veggie/vegan fare SO we went in. \n\nWe were pleasantly greeted right away and immediately informed of the restaurant's philosophy, beginnings and great dish suggestions. Apparently, the owner has been veggie/vegan for a long time and truly believes in this kind of diet/food intake. My dad says that true Buddhists who are vegetarians don't eat garlic or onion either - wow. The waitress, although not veggie/vegan herself, is 100% confident about their food and is very helpful with letting you know what's good! She was right with everything she suggested! And we were dumbfounded!\n\nHere's what we had:\n\n*shark fin soup (omg, it was SO good and SO unbelievably unbelievable! I really thought I was eating actual shark fin soup!)\n*chicken nuggets (yeah, weird, right? The waitress said it was a winner and it was! STILL couldn't believe there was not meat - they used a pressed tofu? and the texture comes out like meat)\n*honey walnut prawns ( I don't know how they do it but the \"shrimp\" was like real shrimp. I forget what the waitress said about how they made it.. probably because I was still in shock)\n*chicken curry fried rice ( wow, I will never doubt fake chick EVER again)\n*ma pao tofu ( a little on the too-much red color side, but it was spicy and delicious nonetheless)\n*bean curd rolls (I love these almost anywhere but these were AWESOME! and the mustard greens served with them were tender and juicy!)\n*a beef dish that I can't remember but didn't try because I don't like beef... I know, it's not real beef but it still threw me off... heh.\n\nAll the dishes were so good! Me, being a garlic and onion fanatic, didn't even miss them at all! I don't know how they do it, but they do it well even without those flavorful foods!\n\nThe only gripe? A bit on the pricey side for Chinese vegetarian food. Does fake meat/tofu meat cost more than real meat? And.. this was the first time we ever paid $14 for honey walnut prawns (fake prawns at that!). \n\nA great experience. We learned so much!

It doesn't matter whether you're vegetarian or a meat eater -- it's just really yummy Chinese food, which is suprisingly hard to find in the city for someone who grew up travelling to Asia throughout her childhood.\n\nWe've brought my dad here who is a super meat eater and even he liked it, which is a little shocking (the acid test really). Plus the waitstaff is really friendly. We're regulars and Rachel always guides us to what she likes and what is new and tasty on the menu.\n\nLove, love, love the water dumplings, the lettuce cups (better than most meat versions I've eaten), the eggplant with sea bass is always a hit, the hot and sour soup is actually made the way it's supposed to be made, both hot and sour with complex flavors, the taro cakes aslo yum as is the spinach fried rice. \n\nThe menu is huge and we've tried most of it with some dishes being more sucessful than others depending on our personal taste (a lot of people love the lemon chicken, which is also really good but a bit sweet for us personally) but we've had a lot of fun trying everything and always just ask Rachel for advice.\n\nIf you like dessert and want something a little unusual, the black sesame filled mochi rolled in peanuts is a very Asian and a super yummy dessert, all about the smooth, chewy texture and the smokey, sweet, nutty black sesame filling.", "author": "Karen C."}

The chicken nugget appetizers reminded me of Chicken McNuggets. Their fried chicken in lemon sauce was the same. Not unlike a Boca Burger Chik'n patty, battered and fried. Not bad, but not remarkable either. The curry tofu w/ vegetables--quite bland. This is Asian-style curry, so no surprise.

I looked on yelp to find a tasty vegetarian place in the Inner Sunset, and decided to check out Enjoy Vegetarian because of the mostly good reviews.\n\nWell, that was a big mistake! I got take out, so I can't comment on the service, but the food was really awful. I got the Braised Spareribs w/ Bean Curd, Taro & Napa Cabbage in Clay Pot (without the claypot because it was takeout) and I thought the whole thing was awful. I'm really not picky with restaurant food, and as a long-time vegetarian was excited to try this place. The sauce in the dish was very bland, the taro and cabbage tasted disgusting and over cooked, the tofu was just ok. The 'spareribs' tasted decent, but not good. \n\nI've been to very good chinese vegetarian restaurants before, with imitation meat all over the menu, and loved them. But I will never go back here again! Maybe I should have ordered a dish suggested by other yelpers, but I wanted to be adventurous. Their other dishes may be good, but avoid the spare ribs and taro like the plague!\n\nI'm an easygoing person and usually a mediocre meal doesn't get me very worked up, but this was just awful.

Having difficulty deciding what to eat for lunch, I decided to try out this place.  Basically I ordered a dish to go with a box of rice and picked it up 10 minutes later.  The dish I ordered was Black Pepper sauce with Steak Meat and Vegetables.  The total bill came out to be $10.30...rather pricey for 'vegetarian' food but worth a try.  \n\nNow I got to say the food was pretty good.  It was the right amount of salt and had just the right amount of flavor in it.  They gave lots of green vegetables and had probably about 10 pieces of the steak meat.  I'm not sure what the steak meat was made out of but I liked it.  \n\nSo why did I give this place 3 stars instead of 4? Well, turns out that almost half of the steak meat they gave me was spoiled.  Sad but true.  =(  I was eating my food and on my 2nd piece of steak meat I bit into it and it tasted pretty sour.  At first I thought maybe it was supposed to be that way so I bit into another different piece which was sweet.  Then I smelled the sour one again and it definately had a sour smell to it! Instead of wasting the food, I decided to try bits of each 'meat' to check if they were spoiled and turns out that almost half were somewhat sour.  Other than that I had no other problems.\n\nDon't know if they knew it was spoiled at all but considering I tried this place only once and haven't seen anyone else complain about spoiled 'meat' then I would try this place again.", "author": "sidney c."}

It comes with a bright yellow lemon sauce, and it's just fried slices of \"chicken,\" but yummy sweet.\n\nI got some take out the other night and tried the BBQ pork appetizer. It was very moist, kind of sweet with a hint of cinnamon I think. And that sounds a little weird maybe, but put it all together and it was hard to stop eating it.\n\nI also got the take out veggie special chow mein. Not really greasy like I expect chow mein to be, and that's a good thing. A really large portion too. It was a good deal.\n\nWhen I go in, I've had a lot of good stuff. I tried the kung pao prawns, and the texture was a little chewier than I remember shrimp being. I thought it was kind of weird but my boyfriend like it. It was good, but the texture threw me off.\n\nWe always get the hot and sour soup.

This was actually the first time ever that I could not finish my meal at a Chinese restaurant, and I was hungry. My husband had #91 Gluten, Black Mushroom, Tofu and Green Vegetable and the only thing good about that was the greens; generally this dish was also very greasy, salty, and unappealing.\n\nWe did not want to write this review because we try to support totally vegetarian restaurants, since there are so few of them.

I take the blame myself, because of my bad choice ordering food, which resulted in a 4 star experience.  I think the next time I go back, I will have a 5 star experience and will adjust accordingly.\n\nMy brother (a carnivore) and I (a vegetarian) came to this restaurant with fairly high expectations, and walked away without them met, but still very happy.  Why weren't they met?  Well, the mushroom/tofu dish we had was just bland.  I mean, it was tasteless.  Then there was the mushroom and pea sprouts.  Let me quality this dish first.  Pea sprout (dadoumiao) is my favorite vegetable EVER.  It's so wonderfully delectable, and goes great stir fried in garlic.  However, instead of getting it with garlic, we got it with mushroom, a big mistake.  It had slightly less flavor and the mushrooms didn't really suit it, not to mention the mushroom / pea sprout combo cost more than qingchaodadoumiao :(  Dadoumiao is already expensive, so paying more for a weaker dish sucks.\n\nMan, so far I've made it sound like a crappy experience, but really, I blame myself.  I really should have tried more faux meat dishes, like the crispy chicken which was just bloody awesome!  It had that great meaty texture, and while it was definitely not meat, it had that succulent taste/texture that I've missed so much.  Simply put, it made me happy :)  It even earned a thumbs up approval from my carnivore brother.\n\nSo, +1 for faux meat dishes, +1 for overall cheap, good food ($6-$8 for most dishes) (barring the pea sprouts which are expensive everywhere), -1 for me ordering bad dishes.\n\nI'll definitely be back!", "author": "William C."}

It was VERY tasty and the bowl was huge (a small order is $6.50 & enough for 6-7 bowls)! To me it tasted pretty darn close to the real thing minus shark fin, with mushrooms. My grandma told me we shouldn't order it because she thought it was expensive (as she thought I was ordering the real thing).  Then she kept telling me \"This meat is fake!\" (as though I didn't know and was being ripped off) and then laughed thinking that other people in the restaurant were being duped. \n\n*Coconut Sauce with Taro and Chicken - I LOVE taro dishes so I picked this out from the menu right away... the taro was soft and the sauce was sweet!\n\n*Chow Mein with Tomatoes and Beef - the sauce over the noodles was just right and the beef had this charred flavor that actually reminded me of meat\n\n*Eggplant with Sea Bass (fake) - was soft and decent..but I feel its something to share for 3 or more people not 2, to me..   It confused my grandma who was like... \"That dish looked like fish...and kind of tasted like fish... but it wasn't!\".  \n\n*Tofu and eggplant with Satay Sauce - great safety dish...I don't think you can not like this.\n\n*Lettuce Wraps - bit pricey but soo delish\n\nAt the end of the meal there's a complimentary dessert (we got some warm and sweet Chinese dessert soups).  Overall meals are good and priced fairly. Service was lightning quick and the servers were very approachable (don't be shy to ask for a recommendation).

Found Enjoy Vegetarian with a google search as it was close to where my partner lives in the city. I was sad to see that they closed at 9 but thought I'd call anyway. The individual who answered the phone let me know that I could come as late as 9:20 to pick up my order as long as I placed it in time for the kitchen to prepare by 8:55. \n\nAside from this great flexibility I was excited to find that the food was delicious. Ordered the chicken drumsticks which instead of being deep fried as veggie drumsticks are had a kind of \"skin\" on them. It may still have been deep fried but it was different than I have had and very delicious. I would say the only downfall of the drumsticks is that they were on a short wooden dowel rather than sugar cane stick as is used in many other places I have been. I also ordered the sweet and sour chicken. It wasn't the usual sweet and sour sauce but the chicken had a very \"meaty\" flavor. Almost kind of smokey. Delicious! The spring rolls were also tasty.\n\nI am a full time meat eater and part time vegetarian eater (when I go out with my partner who is a full time vegetarian) and would highly recommend Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant for good eats and, as far as take out is concerned, great service.", "author": "Natalie T."}

Aside from the word vegetarian painted on the window, there is nothing visually appealing about this place.  I took a pass for a few years. Having made the decision to give it a try, think positive and look for parking. Keep looking, look further, now go up the hill and don't give up. You will start to just forget about it, try it some other time, but don't give up. \n\nThe menu is so long that it is nearly impossible to decide what to try. Remind yourself that this is not your last meal. That's my mantra for movin' right along. You can also ask questions, but English here is extremely limited and you need to be patient, quiet, and really listen. It's worth the time.  The women that work here are absolutely the nicest and most patient angels on earth. They are also quick to offer little treats! Samples of some of the little goodies..those goodies that you just can't decide on.\n\nThey also have a lunch special menu :) You choose your entree and that comes with a lovely cup of soup and a spring roll or, if they are out of those, you may end up with the killer potato currie puff--yummy stuff. If you order just one lunch and also, with intent to share, order off the regular menu, they will  kindly  bring your friends those lovely cups of soups and puffs--just because! As I said, the women are just the nicest people you will ever encounter.\n\nAs for the menu, good luck. Thus far, and I have been there 5 times, the only dish that I truly did not like was the seabass. But what was I thinking! I don't even like real deal, so why would I like the faux fish. I tried it because a stranger, sitting at the next table and not a vegetarian, told me that it was his favorite. Silly me.  I love the sesame chicken, taro, and veggies in coconut sauce. The pumpkin and taro is a close second. The sweet and sour chicken is a must oder when you are sharing with reluctant carnivores. It's a sure hit. The brown rice is special, although I can't tell you why. I've had several of the noodle dishes but can't remember which was the favorite. Over 300 items on the menu can be overwhelming. Remember the mantra, \" this is not my last meal\", you will need to repeat that if you are ever to make a decision. They also have a sampler of their tofu. Super yummy. That's a deifinite have to try.\n\nThe place lacks ambiance.The tables are the crappy little formica type. .If you go with friends and spend time laughing, this shouldn't be a problem. \n\nThey are closed on Monday. Lucky for me, it's open today and that lunch is calling my name...Oh,  did I mention that they never rush you out the door. The only downside is that they don't deliver and parking will take longer than you would like.This is still the inner-sunset and parking will always be an issue.\n\nOne star for choices\nOne star for quality\nOne star for helpful staff\nOne star for those cute little soup bowls with lunch\nMinus top rating for lack of delivery, parking, and ambiance", "author": "francez M."}

The menu and the execution seem to be the same at the other location in the Financial District, but I like the neighborhood feel of this place better--and it's closer to home.\n\nThe interior is bright, colorful, sparkling clean.

Sweet & sour gluten, veggie pot stickers, spinach & pine nut fried rice, and eggplant with string beans in a black bean sauce. \n\nWe all tried each other's selections and everything was amazing. Seriously. Everything. \n\nThe prices are totally reasonable, and the menu is immense. \n\nHighly, highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians-who-enjoy-good-food alike.\n\nMy only critique is that I don't think they serve any beer or wine there.

Let me say first that I may be biased because Chinese vegetarian is my ABSOLUTE favorite food in the whole world, and I have high expectations for good Chinese cooking 1) coming from a city with such a large Chinese community and2) possibly being spoiled from eating at Happy Family vegetarian restaurant (if I could, I'd hire the chef to be my personal cook) in LA. To cut to the chase, quality-wise, the food did not disappoint. Everything was very flavorful without being too salty, even without onion and garlic. I tried the highly praised eggplant w/ veggie sea bass and taro-coconut \"chicken\" with sesame and was very pleased with the flavors and textures of both dishes. 5 stars on quality of food. \nPortion-wise, however, I would be hard-pressed to give this place even 1 star. For nearly $10 a dish, the portions were painfully small, most served on dishes no larger than a medium-sized dinner plate. In fact, our appetizer came in a plate no bigger than a saucer for a tea cup, and we paid $6 for that! I could easily get a full meal at Naan 'n Curry for that kind of money. Both my brothers tore through the dishes and were wondering if we were going to get more food. Minus 1 star for the stingy portions. \nFurthermore, while we were dining, one of the owner's friends came in. She immediately set out a large platter of food and said in Chinese, \"Don't worry, it's on the house.\" Maybe I'm just sensitive, but I REALLY did not appreciate the blatant preferential treatment she gave other customers. I paid just as much for the food as they did and I should be treated the same way. Clearly the restaurant does not care to earn our patronage. Minus 1 star for the unprofessional treatment - and I think that's being quite lenient! I really want to like this place and support the vegetarian restaurant community in SF, but until Enjoy changes their management practices, I won't be coming back.", "author": "Catherine C."}

They're just kind of fun.  Enjoy has a few things that are truly amazing, such as any dish containing \"barbecued pork\".  The \"fragrant crispy chicken\", an appetizer, is the best fake meat I've ever had.  (And as a vegetarian for over 10 years, I've tried almost everything.  Corn dogs!).  But, many of the dishes are hit-or-miss.  While some taste great, others are strange or have little flavor.  When trying something new here, you never really know what you're going to get, which is why I only give Enjoy 3 stars.  They also recently raised their prices, which I'm not crazy about.

The menu includes Mongolian Beef - Golly! - but not a single beef, chicken, pork, etc. entree is real meat. Tasty, too - and faux meat can be REALLY pathetic.  Not at Enjoy, folks!  It's doesn't have trendy upscale prices; you can eat like a pig there and still have money for those user-hateful Clipper Cards that MUNI needed to slow things down even more. Seriously, it's a typical Chinese menu except for there not being any meat. There's some discreet spiritual literature at the front but Enjoy - happily, for me - lacks the  disquieting \"Is this a cult?\" vibe of Ananda Fuara. The 12th and Kirkham branch is in a great little part o town. Quiet as hell, in a residential area without another business or shop in sight.

I have tried several other veggie restaurants in the city, and think i liked those much better.  I am not buddhism, but i  guess according to the strict buddhism theory, vegetarian food should be more \"clean/pure\" , not allowed to have for example, onion and garlic, etc. Basically anything potentially trigs sense of \"impurity\" should not be included in the food.

I tasted good, but too bland after I had a taste of the mongolian \"beef\" and eggplant and \"seabass\" dish. The lotus root dish looked better and more bountiful in the picture. The mongolian beef of course didn't taste like beef, but the spices were a kick in the mouth. The same applies for the eggplant seabass dish, and of course it didn't feel like dish either. I saw on their website that they have a lunch special before 2:00pm, but we didn't receive such a menu when we were there before that time. It didn't bother me much, and it was an overall \"alright\" experience. I don't know if I'd come back though. I'll definitely continue to try other vegetarian places, since I haven't much to compare with.", "author": "Elaine H."}

I've had numerous dishes, I can't remember the names, but I do remember having the lemon chicken. Though it looks odd- picture semicircular pieces of \"chicken\" floating atop a bright yellow pond of lemon juice- it tastes really good!! The chicken wasn't half bad! Quite tasty with some brown rice and Chinese tea to wash it down. It's a bit greasy, so I wouldn't eat this everyday. I've also had the spinach and pine nut fried rice. This was delicious! I normally do not like fried rice at all (I hate peas), so this was a change for me. I quite enjoyed it. Some other dishes I've had were the cold appetizer plate (love this, even at other restaurants) and some beef dishes. I don't like the imitation beef as much as the chicken, however. The fake chicken seems to resemble real chicken more than the fake beef resembles real beef. I love that they use broccoli a lot, it's my favorite vegetable. All in all, good flavors, and good food. A little pricey for my student budget, but the lunch specials are a good deal. I definitely would come back!", "author": "Bub B."}

Fresh flavorful food, hearty portions, low prices. I often crave their chicken curry pot.  My non-vegetarian friend complained that all the fake meat tasted like cereal - a little sweet and grainy. Mmmm cereal. Maybe that's why I like it so much. Delicious.", "author": "C M."}

Not quite enough room for a large party.  Will definitely go back and also do takeout.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  We grabbed a couple of menus and will refer others.", "author": "Di F."}

I like vegetarian places but it's weird because everytime I go, I still lean toward the noodle and rice dishes, along with vegetable and tofu dishes. Somehow, I still stray away from the fake meat, even though I know there's no meat. Anyways, the night we came here consisted of hard tofu (as opposed to normal soft tofu) with celery, gluten with vegetables, and some noodles with mustard greens. All dishes were good, with natural taste, no msg stuff with \"enhanced flavoring\" that make you thirsty. We initially ordered two dishes, but upon finishing those two dishes, we ordered the noodles. For dessert, we got mo mo ja ja, as my boyfriend translates, \"random shit.\" Well I guess it's not that random to me as I am familiar with desserts like this at Chinese restaurants. Good altogether. Service was nice and friendly, price was a little high but understandable because it isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.", "author": "Yosie G."}

It was really good.  We ordered the chicken stripe over chinese choy shum (vegetable) and the order of \"Lion Head\".  The Lion Head was good, with very light flavor, but if you are here for the chinese vegetarian flair, \"Lion Head\" is not the dish.  You also have your choice of white rice, or brown rice.  \nThe waitress there (Rachael) was really nice as well.  She last on the evening came up and asked how things were and since this is our first time, she later recommend some signiture dish for us to try next time.  It sounds like the sea bass with eggplant is one of the most popular dish there, along with beef stew, and lamb stew (all meat made from soybeans) no MSG either!\nAnd at last, we had their complementry desert of the day~ sweet! Ginger and yam soup.\nOverall it's a great experience, and we will definitely go back again.\nAnd next time you go for the first time, I do suggest to ask the waitress for recommendation, that will definitely enhance your eating experience there!", "author": "Millie K."}

I just don't go there as often as I like because it's so out of the way for me and it's hard to find parking.  It's all vegetarian Chinese food with mock meat dishes and veggie dishes.  It's not at all expensive; it's family style but not as expensive as most family-style Chinese restaurants (that usually charge $15 per dish).  I've eaten Chinese food all my life so I can kinda judge what's good and what's crap.", "author": "Jolene L."}

I have been there twice now and LOVE it! the best ever! I drive about 40 min out my way just to eat there, so worth my gas. Service is amazing.
