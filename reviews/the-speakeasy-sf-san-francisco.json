Oops!\n\nI'm costume averse, shying away from Halloween parties. But it was easy to find \"flapper\" style dresses on Amazon, and mine was under $40. I am not ever comfortable wearing a costume, but I quickly learned to appreciate my period dress, as I was then part of the 1920s scene, just like everyone else.\n\nI loved stepping down into the Speakeasy. It was like going into another era, for sure. The set design was well done, as if we were on a real set in a professional play. Performances were top-notch. I was so impressed by the acting, especially by the showgirls in their dressing room, whom we watched through a two-way mirror - bravo, bravo! \n\nI felt a bit like the Ebenezer, when visiting Christmases past and future. It was like walking among people who don't see you, but in a good way.\n\nAll our phones had been locked up, so no one was checking into Facebook or Yelping or taking selfies for Instagram, and that helped to keep the experience more authentic. The only thing I missed was not knowing the time (since phones were locked up and mine was in coat check) and we had to be outside to catch our ride home at a certain time. I recommend wearing a (non-Smart) watch.\n\nI'm not a drinker so being at a Speakeasy was kind of daunting for me. I would have loved a coffee!\n\nNot much offerings by way of food at the Speakeasy, so we snuck out early and had a quick meal of freshly made dim sum right next door at China Live. \n\nThe Speakeasy was immersive and fun.

Long story short, it's pretty different. \n\nI'm one of the people who were swept off their feet by Sleep No More and due to the excellent experience there, became interested in the Speakeasy. In its essence, both shows fall in the same category of immersive theater, but otherwise, to me at least, the experience is very different.\n\nFor one, Sleep No More's main story arch is more a combination of horror and intrigue as compared to The Speakeasy, which falls more in the genre of historical fiction. If you enjoy solving mysteries and occasionally elements of horror, you won't really find that at The Speakeasy. However, you will find more straightforward story lines and humor, lots and lots of jokes. They are more keen to make you laugh and have a good time then to scare you. The most scary/twisted scenes are nothing compared to ones in Sleep No More (which are more raw and disturbing)\n\nThe Speakeasy performance also focuses more on character interactions. They really make sure you feel as if you a part of the world in which the actors dwell. The actors will often try to make eye contact, ask you questions, get you involved, whereas in the Sleep No More, very rarely do actors interact with you, and for the most part as a viewer, you act as imaginary observers of their world, not participants in them, which was the case in the Speakeasy where Actors were actively aware of your existence.\n\nSleep No More also features a mix of interpretative dancing and acting, but not so much singing. (at least from what I recall) There is a lot of singing and dancing at the Speakeasy, but nothing as abstract as interpretative dancing. \n\nSome other differences include the fact that scenes don't shift over time at the Speakeasy. In Sleep No More, scenes often change, things gets moved around, the same area you visited before, could look very different when you visit it again. Additionally, there is much more ground covered in the Sleep No More show as compared to the Speakeasy, which features ~6-7 main areas. It took my bf and I very little time to discover all the areas, after that we kept on expecting more rooms or areas to open up, but they didn't, which made the exploration part kind of boring.\n\nThis is solely my experience however, my BF preferred the Speakeasy more to his Sleep No More experience which he found to be too abstract. Overall, I'm just happy that more of this style of entertainment is available!\n\nP.S. As other people wrote in their reviews, don't get the premium tickets. They don't offer much additional except small complimentary drinks. Other than that, the \"premium\" seating is not that useful. We were placed too awkwardly in the front in the bar and it actually made it even more difficult to enjoy the show as they stuffed us to share a table with another couple right next to the piano area. I had to crane my neck backwards to see what was going on. Probably was better to actually sit further back.", "author": "Sherica L."}

The space is small, however, so it can get old/boring pretty quick once you've seen each room. The gambling isn't for real money. Not sure how there are pictures of inside (the ones from customers) on Yelp, but they no longer allow phones inside and you're required to turn it off in front of them and put it in a pouch.There's a photo booth inside but it was broken when we went so we couldn't take any pictures. The waitress at cabaret show never came by to take our drink order so we had to wave someone else down to take our order, which ended up being close to the end of the show. The actors were pretty good. Lots of drama throughout entire story line. I'd go back to show a friend, but not for my own entertainment.", "author": "Natasha K."}

From getting dressed up like a flapper to the very end of the night. I highly recommend dressing up in the 1920's attire. This was a pretty pricey deal though. We paid like $300 for a table for the entire night ($100/hr), plus $75 for drinks, $100 for renting costumes, and $35 for the optional photo. First off, we did NOT rent costumes from them so I have no idea what the rates are here. We got a male (gangster) and a female (flapper) from a dance store in San Rafael (total for both was $100). I highly recommend getting the picture. The photographer will pose you, take a few shots and hook you up with the best one. This is great since you can't bring a phone (which I loved not seeing cell phones everywhere). That would've absolutely ruined it for me. I think the table was unnecessary, tbh. Although it was nice to have a place to come back and sit down every once in a while. I don't recommend wearing high heels if you're not used to walking around in them. I made that mistake and wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. Every time we came back to sit at the table, I noticed we could just sit wherever there was a free one and no one checked if we paid for it or for how long. I'm pretty sure anyone can just sit wherever. At the beginning of the night there was the most people watching the show in the cabaret. During that time it would be good to have a table reserved. The show went on for the whole time we were there. The performers were great, and really gave it an authentic feel. I really felt like this is exactly what it would've been like to go to a speakeasy back in the day. I can't judge the food or drinks because I just had water. I did peek at the menu and it was mostly appetizers and drinks. They did have like one sandwich I think. It did not look like people come here for the food. I didn't see much and we went out to dinner before. \nWe did arrive fashionably late because we missed their last email giving us instructions on how to get in. So, we ended up going to the location marked here on Yelp and it was way off. I'm pretty sure they don't want their exact location disclosed and they were very secretive about the whole thing. That slightly complicated things but added to the authentic vibe. Overall, the performers and everyone who we came across went out of their way to make this fun and as realistic as possible. I will absolutely go again!", "author": "Sylvia L."}

There were several people there by themselves just to watch the characters, and several there who mentioned it wasn't their first time. For those organizing groups- We had some issues with everyone buying their own tickets so I'd maybe buy everyone's tickets and have them Venmo me next time. Kristen was AMAZING for helping to sort everything out. Everyone was wowed when we walked around and got pulled in for special things. I'd always kind of have a meeting point to get back to if you're trying to coordinate. The man on the moon picture only holds eight people so we split our group up for photos. Also, may want to let your guests know this is not a true bar experience- speaking quiet is really encouraged- and the goal is not to get drunk but slightly tipsy. Also- tip for this with medical devices connected to your phone, remember to bring another monitor so they can take your phone. We went to Tamarind Hall (walking) before and they were not able to get us within 1 h and 20 mins so get there extra early, we went to 15 romolo after- which was perfect and you can make a table reservation there.

Probably less crowded too.  Not sure if it was really worth it to go to the earlier seating in the Casino.  You just have more time to gamble with fake money.  If we were to do it again, probably would want to get early seating in the Cabaret since it would seem like a show would be on at that point?\n\nLoved how you could go from one room to the next and see storylines take place.  Repeat visits mean you would be seeing new stories if you follow different rooms.  Action is happening even as you go through different corridors and have peepshow access to stages set up as dressing rooms and private offices\n\nAlso loved how they would pull in audience members as part of the show. keeps you on your feet!\n\nI was surprisingly delighted by how much i enjoyed the old-timey banter at the cabaret.

The check-in process is smooth, and they are in character from the time you meet up at a predetermined spot (they tell you where the day before) to the time the party ends. The venue is large, and you have free rein of the place and can interact with characters all you want - just don't go in any rooms marked \"private.\" I enjoyed following the characters from room to room to follow their storylines and watching the variety of acts in the cabaret.

Was so fun to get dressed up and hang out in a nice space - you get to be entertained and also participate in this unique experience. Its fun to wander through the various areas (bar, casino, cabaret, dressing room, etc.) to witness the various stories that unfold.  So much better than just sitting and watching a show. But you can do that instead - the cabaret has a constantly changing show of entertainers (singing, dancing, comedy) of the period you could just choose to sit and watch the whole time, but you'd really be missing out by not exploring! Exciting to guess who is an actor and who is an audience member since you usually can't tell since everyone is in period dress (actually very easily found and relatively affordable on Amazon).\n\nTip - order a drink and casino chips before you get there (they'll give you an option to set up a tab in advance since no cash or cards are accepted during the event to keep with the period theme). You'll have fun using the chips at the gaming tables (roulette, black jack, and craps) but they don't have any value so just fun to have some to play with.\n\nDo this! :-)", "author": "Rose B."}

It was completely realistic and interactive. and we loved every moment from finding the man in the yellow hat to every one who kept in character throughout the rooms. We went to the Cabernet room first and my husband was Dick, a famous person that people kept asking autographs from. The lighting was a bit dark and I accidentally ordered desserts instead of a drink. I think the writing on the menu should've been bigger because of the lighting but the lightening was good for the atmosphere. I did finally order my first drink of the night as recommended by the patron next to me. It was really good. Moving onto the next room, the bar, they had their own show going on. It was wonderful to watch. The waitress recommended a drink that I absolutely loved. It was on the sweet side just how I like it. It gave me a really good buzz that lasted the rest of the night. The 3rd room was the Casino in which my husband had a great time gambling and our dealer was really funny. He even said he wished he could stay longer if he could. I wish we could've taken pics inside but understand why. We left the night very satisfied. In the morning I finally got the itinerary of what we spent and I thought that it was over priced. A 3 piece desert was nearly 10 dollars, 1 macaroon, a small pastry with filling, and a half finger of something else. The 2 drinks I ordered were both between 16-19 dollars for the size that look like it should be for sample tastings. Even the beer my husband ordered which was the cheap east item on our bill was still quite expensive cuz he's s cup looked like it could be a tasting sample. We definitely had a good time and glad we ate before arriving cuz we prolly would've spent more on their food. Should we come again, which we might.

I don't get the chance to dress up unless it's Halloween. But being invited to attend a birthday party here it gave me a chance to doll up. The dress code is firm. You must dress up. No exception. With this rule, this added more a solid feeling of being part of the 1920s. I love the fact, not one of the women dresses or men suits who were there that night wore the same outfits. Everyone was dressed to the Ts and authentic (so fun). The people who are working there blends in with the guest and you are not sure if they are the guest or works there. There were a couple of times I was asking how they know the birthday boy (hahaha). Anyway, you do not need to bring any money since the time you order the tickets you can save your credit card information and the time you are there, they give you a label card with your name. It took me a while since I was having such fun at the gambling room but there are three other rooms to go to.

Based on the description, the emails, the photos, it clearly had a Sleep No More vibe, which is probably one of the best shows of all time. \n\nUnfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. Not even close.  Came here on their Halloween weekend, which I know is a slightly different experience than their usual, but since they charged the same and decided to put it on, I should be able to judge it by the same standards.\n\nThe bad: The place is small.  Within 10 minutes we felt like we had seen every part of it.  After several more hours of wandering, we realized we were pretty much right.  Paying for experiences was both a hassle and consistently put us out of the 1920s feel.  When you have guys with clipboards asking to check your ticket at every door, it's hard to lose yourself in the moment.  When those guys give you inconsistent and contradictory instructions, it starts feeling like a bad Disneyland ride. \n\nMy advice: Double the price of the event and make everything included.  Instead of paper tickets, give people a key or a keepsake as their way to get in and to get charged for drinks/food.  \n\nOnly ask for an entry key once, if you have a problem with people sneaking in, then beef up security at the door rather than asking patrons to keep re-showing their tickets.  \n\nHave more actors with lines who interact and less who just stumble around and around the room without adding much.  Have a dress code, and enforce it. Too many people came looking like they were going hit up a Hollywood club. \n\nDon't charge $35 for a photograph.  Every single person in the room has a phone that can hold over fifty thousand photos. Don't encourage us to use our phones (and the annoying flash) by placing ridiculous prices on your house photographer.  \n\nI think this place could be awesome and I would love a Sleep No More type experience on the West Coast.

The overall experience was great and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to do something new and fun.  I am always looking to try new things and go new places in the city. I found this place while searching a bit online.  After you buy the tickets they email you a \"secret location\" to meet and try in several ways to keep it as authentic as possible to the 1920's era while still having fun and giving them reasons to charge you $$$.\n\nPros:\nThere are three main rooms to explore and 3 smaller ones. Each room has its own \"show\" going on and you are free to come and go as you please.\n\nCocktail attire and or 1920s attire is required but 98% of the people there were in 1920s and really got into the process.\n\nIt was an overall good time and a step away from a normal night out. It was a semi unique experience and the shows were entertaining.\n\nCons:\nWe started in the casino where they took our coats and gave us the house rules.  Besides the rules we were not given much information on how to best experience the evening. Since you are free to come and go and the shows are all going on at once we were not really sure if the story was rotating or if the same story went from start to finish in each room.  As we moved about we always had a bit of fomo either of our story not being over or what we may be missing in the next. As I got to some places it seemed that the stories may have been connected but I still do not know if we stayed in the right places for the right amount of time if we would have seen an entire show sequentially the way they meant for us to see it.\n\nPrice: the show prices range and the drinks do as well which you would expect but since they make you create a tab ahead of time by the end of the night you may not know exactly how much you are spending.  I don't mind paying for those but the things that bother me a bit are the $10 fee for casino chips (which seem like part of the showing since you are paying for the experience and you should play a little) and the $35 fee for the photo. \nTowards the end of the night after a few drinks and seeing most of the show we came across a line of people and of course we had to ask what for.  They said it was a photo and since you are not allowed to bring phones inside we thought why not. Little did we know after a 15 minute line commitment we were waiting for a $35 black and white 5x7 (only 1 pic for 3 girls). \n\nAll in all I would recommend but I do not feel the need to go back unless another group of friends really wanted to check it out. I would suggest dressing up and making the most of it.", "author": "Danielle B."}

However, the \"script\" which we were then required to pay attention to, had no real through line to the plot and the characters were not connected.  So, there were sets of characters who, I guess, you could be interested in and then follow around, but not allowed to interact with in any way.  But the \"dialogue\" didn't really give you a reason to be interested.  The facility was well done, the costumes and actors were mostly good, there were (expensive) drinks and gambling (with no winnings).   Either make it interactive, since we dressed up to be a part of the ambiance, or make the \"scenes\" and characters interesting enough to care about so we would want to pay attention.\n\nAll in all, a little confusing and not all that interesting.

I can't go too much in depth because I really don't want to spoil it.  Just a few things.. make sure to DRESS UP. You don't want to be the odd one out who isn't dressed up like the Roaring 20's.  Many people were dressed up down to the T so be prepared.  This isn't a place where you can socialize and have a few drinks with friends.  I did go with a group of 12.  It's doable and we all still had fun, but this is a speakeasy so make sure to behave and speak speakeasy.  The actors were WONDERFUL!!!!!  We had more than enough time to go in all the rooms.  Drinks were a tad bit overpriced, but they were definitely strong.  The d\u00e9cor was so detailed and stayed true to the era.

Save your\nmoney and go to a jazz bar where you'll get better entertainment and actually be able to talk. This was a disappointing and amateur production. Staff for the most part was very rude and lacked that \"umph\" which really makes an immersive theatre experience. Maybe for somebody who's never experienced immersive theatre, this would be cool at most, but for somebody such as myself who's passionate about immersive theatre, this was a MAJOR disappointment. The actors would at times interact with you but you're expected to stand there like a mute because we aren't so privileged enough to talk. Give me a break. There is clearly no passion behind this production and the lackluster, straight up stupid performance attests to this. We were made to feel like hecklers if we tried to interact or respond to any actors. There isn't any direction in the entire production or clarity in what role we were allowed to play in this complete jumblef*ck of a performance. The only positive of the night was one of the actresses named Dorothy/ Dot who was a total star, she should be running the creative direction of the entire show.  \nThe jokes in the cabaret were stupid and struggled to crack a smile from anyone in the crowd. As we were not familiar with casino games, this room was entirely pointless for us. As we were trying to collect our phones from the phone check, somebody passed out and the security literally shoved us out of the way, extremely rudely and unexpectedly. I experienced rude actors throughout every stage of the experience, and not in a fun/ interesting way. Moral of the story: if the speakeasy wants to be respected, they better get their act together, do their research, give the actors some improv classes and completely restructure the current performance. There are too many high level immersive theatre experiences in the world that are cheaper and life changing, this simply doesn't cut it. Left me with a sour taste.", "author": "Eve M."}

It was so much fun dressing up and meeting my party for dinner. When we walked down the street to find our clandestine contact, people stopped us and asked where we were going. Soon, we saw other groups dressed in 20s wear going in all different directions -- turns out there are four discreet entrances. \n\nThe whole experience of being checked in and escorted into the \"clock shop\" was so much fun. Everyone turns off the technological doohickeys so there's breaking the illusion once you're in there. I was so happy to see that EVERYONE dresses up and some people really go out. After climbing through a grandfather clock, we entered the Speakeasy. Immediately, you are immersed in this world of intrigue. The drama is happening all around you! \n\nI don't want to say too much because it's amazing and you need to experience it for yourself. Suffice it to say that I had a friend in from out of town the next weekend and I knew I had to take her there! I managed to get tickets -- they do sell out and they stop selling them on the site 24 hours in advance (so you have to email and wait for them to call you back). It is a bit expensive -- $115 including fees -- and doesn't include drinks. If you buy chips, you don't win money but the gambling is fun and puts you front and center of the drama. You don't have to drink either though the drinks are fairly reasonable. \n\nAnyway, plan to eat in advance -- they just have a few snacks available to order, be there for three hours (trust me, you won't want to leave!), and be relieved of your phone addiction for a few blissful hours.

Imagine a place where you walk down a flight of stairs and step right into 1923. The Speakeasy takes you there and keeps you in that setting for the entirety of the show (about 3 hours). Remember, this isn't just a bar, this is an immersive theatrical experience. You're inside the show and you can watch it go on around you. You can explore the bar, the casino, and the cabaret at your own pace and there's always something going on. There's a lot of other special hidden locations to discover as well. Through the course of the night you'll find a story playing out with every one of the 30+ characters weaving their way in and out of it. It can be funny, sad, and completely terrifying at times. You can easily go 10 times and not see the same show twice.\n\nA few tips: Dress nice. They're serious about people showing up in jeans being told they can't enter. The drinks are strong. Don't be the drunk jerk who disrupts the show and gets escorted out. Think about eating beforehand. They have snacks, but you're all dressed up and out on the town! Grab dinner. Don't expect to take a bunch of selfies inside. The no cellphones rule is strictly enforced. Explore. There's hidden rooms and things go on in every nook and cranny. There's even a few scenes that take place in the bathrooms!\n\nThis is the type of place that you're probably going to want to come back to since there's just too much to see in one or even three shows.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-09", "description": "One of the joys of partaking in something surprisingly special and unique is to have the experience unfold, revealing the unexpected.  Were I to say too much about The Speakeasy, it would only serve to lessen the experience for you.  In that regard, and counter to every other thing that gets written up on yelp I'd suggest you refer to the SF Chronicle's top-rated Speakeasy review (of 12/23/16) as well as the overall rating that yelpers have assigned to the experience (almost 5 stars, based on upwards of 130 reviews).  Based on this and this only, stop reading and decide if it's for you.  It's no fun to experience a surprise when you've already read all about it.  \n\nAre you going?  Okay then, this is for you (no spoilers, promise):\n\n*  The Speakeasy will run you about $85 per ticket though discount tickets can sometimes be obtained on the Today Tix app.  Add-ins can run the cost up even higher.  I purchased better seats for the cabaret (unnecessary) which added $10 per person to the ticket cost.  \n\n*  The illicit bar/crooked casino/immersive theatrical experience runs a full 3 hours.  When purchasing your ticket you'll choose a starting location (I chose the bar, naturally).  You might also choose your second location.  After that, all bets are off.  There are at least 4 distinct areas to experience as many times as desired, always with something new and different going on.  There's also things to experience in the hallways and behind several hidden doorways.  So move around, follow people, and observe keenly for the best experience.\n\n*  I enjoyed sitting in the bar and the cabaret, just watching the activity.  Another option is to move around more, following a character from one space to the next, so that you can better understand their \"story\".  If you don't follow a character from the onset, it will likely be difficult to understand their story arc.  \n\n*  The theme here is Speakeasy so break out the appropriate garb.  This is not the place for your bodycon dress.  Instead, think flapper attire and maybe stop nearby, for a cocktail before the show; it's fun to see everyone in the local bars, pre-show, all decked out for a bygone era. \n\n*  Your credit card is on file.  Once inside, no money changes hands.  The cocktails in the bar are good, and run about $13.  Nibbles can be had in the Cabaret for $8 and up.  All purchases will be tallied and a record of your total charges will be emailed to you the following day.\n\n*  Your phone goes into a sealed bag where it must remain from time of entry 'til departure.  You'll live.\n\nI wasn't over the top in love with The Speakeasy but I appreciated its uniqueness and execution, and was entertained by it and, in that regard, I can say that neither the Chronicle critic nor the yelp community is wrong.  The Speakeasy makes for a fun and different, immersive evening of theater.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Great attention to detail with dozens of performers recreate a 1923 San Francisco speakeasy where alcohol and gambling are offered in this hidden lounge. Don't let its subterranean location fool you - this is a classy gin-joint. I had expected this would be a lighter entertainment fare - wrong. Aside from the cabaret, little frivolity exists. From snitty showgirls to WWI veterans, we see into the souls of our grandparents' generation.\n\nWe found four major sections of the Speakeasy: we were directed at first to the bar (\"escorted\" ticket), then moved through the casino to the cabaret, then hung out in the parlor. A hidden door takes us into a secret room with a two-way mirror and speaker, allowing us to observe behind the scenes of a 1920s makeup/dressing room. Everywhere you wander, expect a show of some sort.  A place for photos is said to exist, but we never saw it.\n\nPrecise details are down to the tin-tile ceiling and vintage cocktails (Chris had a \"Corpse Reviver\" and I a \"Vieux Carre\"). Chris dressed to the \"nines\" with her flapper dress. This may or may not have been the reason she got a rare personal interaction with a performer. My guess is that over half of the guests did their best to costume up for the occasion. \n\nI highly recommend it. If you go with a group, agree to breakup into couples and venture off on your own. It was a long show, a tad over 3  1/2  hours - you get your money's worth. We parked at the North Beach Garage, 745 Vallejo St. (the competitor across the street has poor reviews and may not be open that late).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-16", "description": "Definitely one of the coolest experiences I've had, especially since I've never been to an immersive play before! We started out in the cabaret after meeting our mystery gal and getting the secret instructions to the venue, and had a great time.\n\nThe actors are all so talented and really make you feel like you're at a 1920s Speakeasy. There are three large rooms (the bar, the casino, and the cabaret) and many smaller rooms to observe (manager's office, dressing room, parlor, lots of hallways/stairwells). Of all the rooms, I best liked the cabaret--it's definitely the most entertaining of all the rooms, and the comic actors, musicians, and dancers make for a great show. Everyone makes an effort to dress appropriately for the period (although if you don't have flapper garb, a normal cocktail attire is fine too) which makes the experience even more fun.\n\nHowever, the price of the ticket at $75 didn't really pay off--the play, while entertaining, was hard to follow and didn't provide a lot of intrigue or plot that made you want to stay until the very end. There's a few \"plotlines\" (read: characters that you can follow) but nothing really went anywhere or culminated in anything. It's definitely more of a place to just sit back and observe and slowly learn \"secrets\" through eavesdropping than an actual narrative.\n\nThe drinks were something terrible--even a basic gin and tonic or moscow mule tasted flavorless and bad. I didn't like their specialty cocktails either. The bubbly cocktail just tasted like tart champagne, and the velvet sea was strangely watery (although it's their most popular). You also have to be careful that others aren't accidentally included on your tab (you don't get the bill until a few days after). Definitely eat before you come, and definitely don't bother with the overpriced snacks. Tea sandwiches I think are only available in the Cabaret. But since people don't come here for the food (obviously), this shouldn't impact your opinion too much.\n\nTips:\n- There are secret rooms (a closet, for example) that you can go into but only if invited. \n- Try to see if you can get a \"mission\" from a cast member. We were given the task of delivering a lost cuff link to \"Tom\" which was pretty fun, since we got to interact with the actors.\n- Explore all the rooms! Some of the most interesting ones are the dressing room and parlor--sometimes even the hallways and staircases will have scenes.\n- Skip the drinks and snacks.", "author": "Wendy W."}

I've heard about the Speakeasy for awhile, and bought tickets for their show back in June. The SO and I went on a night in October and couldn't have been more impressed by what the team here is able to pull off.\n\nThe check in process is a little inefficient like some have mentioned, but I didn't mind it too much. We basically got checked in by an actress and from the minute we met her, it felt like we were being transported back in time. No phones are allowed, which also really helps maintain an appropriate atmosphere that feels realistic. After walking through a secret entrance which gave us speakeasy feels, we started off in the casino. This part I think is a little silly -- you have to pay for chips, even though you can't cash the chips in. We mistakenly bought enough chips for two to play, when we should have just bought one set since you're basically betting in intervals of 5 cents. The point of the experience really isn't to gamble all night. We spent some time in the casino and then once we noticed people flowing in between rooms, we started to move.\n\nIn general I don't want to give away too much about the storyline, but there are definitely multiple ways to handle this. You can either follow a character as they move around different rooms and follow one story line, or you can also stay in a room and just see snippets of storylines. The place is actually quite small, so within a few minutes of wandering, we managed to figure out where everything was. \n\nWe ended up spending out most of our time in the caberet room. I loved that room. The shows were super engaging and funny, and there are some really meaningful storylines that I thought really hit home. The entertainment was just prime. Honestly, we would have been happy to just stay in that room all night. \n\nSome people have criticized that the story line gets too dark... I dunno. Sure some of the things may have been on the darker side, but honestly, I appreciated how real it felt. Sometimes life isn't all shiny, and I found the stories to be really interesting and engaging.\n\nAll in all, an expensive, though awesome way to spend a night. Really wonderful acting, the costume game is on point, and a cool way to feel like you've gotten transported back in time for a night.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

I went with my husband, and we had fun prowling around, but I noticed the big groups seemed to have an especially raucous evening, so I would recommend it if you have guests from out of town, or want to do something special for a birthday. It is kind of pricey, but I think you get a lot for your money, as the show runs pretty long, and you can visit different rooms. (Hint: keep moving around, because things are going on everywhere.) There are loads of performers and acts to watch. Be aware that the authors put a little undercurrent of darkness into the show; it's not all fringed dresses and drinking. Cheapster tip: you can get some non-alcoholic stuff that annoyingly is not listed on the menu. I got really thirsty for something non-dehydrating, so I asked for soda water, and they happily brought it in a big beer mug, and it was only $4.72 including the service charge; a lot cheaper than the cocktails. \n\nI do get the impression the show is purposely designed to get repeat customers by not revealing everything on a first visit. It's hard to see everything; we found out later that there were whole storylines going on that we missed, and we never found out the fates of some of the characters, so that was a little unsatisfying. But I can't fault the organizers for wanting to keep the business going whatever way they can; it's tough to do professional theater in San Francisco. I'm taking one star off for a few things I didn't like, such as anachronisms (I can't quite figure out why they specifically set the show in 1923 when they clearly wanted to use styles and events from later in the decade, and they also threw in a few things from beyond the 20's), but most people will find the show creates a satisfying world that's fun to visit.", "author": "Christine U."}

It was more like we were the furniture in their stage. \nDrinks took forever to come out, and our group ended up getting split up for a lot of it. \nThe picture we paid for didn't really come out well and they would interrupt card games for \"special\" games with just the actors. This was totally a way to shuffle the cards but it was crummy because it took time away from playing. \nAlso for the show at the end of the evening, the waitress came by with a cart of limoncello. We had reserved a special table, and she made it seem complimentary. She also didn't count right so we were charged for 5 when we only had 4.

It was OUTSTANDING!    Every single detail is authentic and detailed.  They didn't miss a beat.  Lots of actors there, some interact with you, some you just watch.   They had a cabaret, a casino, a bar, lots of vignettes that you walk into and see actors playing out a scene.  There are 2 way mirrors into the ladies dressing rooms where you see and hear what's happening behind the scenes.   You can even witness gangsters making deals.  You set up a tab beforehand, so whenever you order something, whether it's chips for the casino, drinks or food, or go to the photobooth, you just show you \"prescription for alcohol\" and it goes onto your tab.

Do what you can to buy discounted tickets to Speakeasy if you decide to go, it is not worth the full price.

We all got super dolled up and loved the theme. Overall I think that this is a show/event that you have to come to a dozen times because there is so much to see and do that you can't see everything in one night, but you can try. One of the cast members advised us to try to move rooms around every 10 minutes and to split up from each other and he had the right idea! Splitting up let us all see different things and at the end of the night we all huddled around and talked about what we saw when we were away with each other. I was astounded of the level of acting that went on throughout the night. It takes an amazing cast to keep up their characters for hours when you are in an interactive stage in multiple rooms, but this event did it well. \n\nI don't want to spoil much, because what is the fun in that, but I do think it would have helped to know a few things before buying your tickets. \n1. Choose your starting room carefully. That room will decided where you start your night. We started with the Cabernet and spent roughly 30-40 minutes there. Very burlesque overall in this room.\n2. If you choose the Cabernet, you can choose the booths (which is very exclusive), but online you will need to pay I think ~$20 per person for the booth for the first hour. We had three people so it was $60 for the 1 hour. If the 20 is too much I would recommend getting a table for the Cab since it will most likely put you close to the stage.\n3. WEAR A WATCH. In order to keep the event a hush hush, you aren't allowed to use your phone for the entire event. You have to turn your electronics off and put them in a brown bag before you even are allowed in. We didn't wear a watch and we had no idea what time it was the entire night until the end of the event. \n4. Keep in mind, the show doesn't stop or repeat. During the event my group thought that each room would have a \"show\" and we would be able to get to see them all. Totally wrong, as the night goes in the characters develop and we learn more about them. My recommendation is to find a character you like and follow them! It's fun and you get to see all about them. \n5. You need to set up your bar tab at least noon of the event. They don't do a cash/card bar at the event so you have to set up a tab beforehand if you want anything during the event. They had complimentary water next to the bar, but it is a long event and you might get thirsty for more than water. If you do want to try something, TRY THE VELVET SEA! Super sweet and yummy. I loved it! At the end of the night your tab goes directly on your card with an 18% tip and they email you the receipt.\n6. Eat ahead of time. You are in SF, food is a plenty. I recommend eating in the area and walking to the event. If you are driving, the area gets difficult to find parking so make extra time to find parking. Most metered stop at 6 pm, well before the event starts.", "author": "Devika B."}

Otherwise you'll be trying to go through your email/text to see who it was again you were supposed to meet and where, and what is it again that happens next.... etc. There's a lot in the details, and you won't have your phone once you get there anyway (you get to keep it, but it will be sealed in a pouch) and really you just won't want to ruin the fun by fiddling with any of that.\n\nOther than that, the less you know in advance, the more fun you'll have.

This night out is a fantastic reason to get gussied up dapper and flapper style, have dinner in North Beach, and drink great cocktails. Maybe one more than you should have, but just one more ;-) The space has been built out and the whole show designed impeccably.

Do not hesitate. You are guaranteed to have a good time.\n\nIf you're not sure if this is the kind of show for you, but you like a fun evening out, GO!

I initially had plans to visit before their formal soft opening, but regrettably had to cancel due to an injury - glad I still made a point of visiting!\n\nTHE OVERVIEW.\n+ Dress in theme; I don't care if it's a nuisance for you to change after work, or to dig up some old sequined number. It's really much more enjoyable if you put in the effort\n~ It's not hard to find the initial entrance, just look for the gaggle of millennials in period costume swarming the street corner\n+ The staff does a good job separating the large group and herding you into separate rooms (the event basically starts with people divided into 3 groups, but after some time, you're free to roam the halls)\n+ The actors are quick on their toes, deliver a terrific performance, and very personable. At no point did I feel awkward or uncomfortable - it was a unique evening, for sure\n+ The drinks are strong and cold, try at least a few\n+ Make a point of spending a significant amount of time in each area (the bar, the cabaret, the casino) - there are many storylines that intertwine, and it's fun to follow along\n\nPRO TIPS.\n- Set up your bar tab in advance (by linking your credit card to your account when you purchase tickets online) - no cash or card can be used at The Speakeasy, only the wooden identifier chip you're given upon entering\n- Don't bother buying a casino chip, unless you genuinely want to faux-gamble\n- Don't bother paying to reserve seats at the cabaret; while it was nice that we had very close seats our first time in the little theater, they don't super police who sits where, and our seats were grabbed by opportunists the next few times we went in. There are plenty of non-paid seats, so save yourself the $$\n- Don't fuss about having to turn off your phones, life is more valuable when you can actually live in the moment\n- Be quiet (speak easy, folks)\n\nIt's not an inexpensive evening, but considering that the actors are basically \"on\" for 3-4 hours, non-stop, and you're being entertained non-stop, it's well worth the price of admission. I can't wait to go back once they've changed their scripts around a bit.", "author": "Claire S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-10", "description": "I was so impressed and enchanted with this amazing, physically beautiful production. It's a fun adventure, even starting on the streetcorners where you have to meet people to send you to the right location, because you already have a sense of complicity with random other people on the street who are dressed up in 20s garb just to see a show. You start picking out people dining in restaurants pre-show in their fringed dresses and cupid's bow lipstick. Once inside, the drinks are excellent and strong, and about 8 zillion story lines emerge and you can only follow so many-- I already can't wait to go back and make some other choices in what I follow. The set design is impeccable, the cast talented and sharp. When the big bustling rooms (the cabaret, the casino, the bar) get to be a bit much, you can find stories playing out in other much quieter places, sometimes one-on-one with an actor. My friend and I ended up in the ladies room reading erotica. I am usually kind of eye-rolly about having to dress up for theme nights, but I was really glad I did (and that so many others did.) (Even if you just made a nod towards the theme with cupid's bow lips and long beads over a shift dress, it would be great. Having so many audience members who really commit to it really keeps the whole environment fun.) Definitely check out the dressing room, the peepholes into the boss's office, and a bunch of places I'm sure I didn't even find on this first trip.", "author": "Victoria L."}

And as far as I'm concerned, it's worth every penny of the ticket price, hands down. \n\nI attended The Speakeasy once last year in previews and just experienced it again last night. I'm absolutely blown away at the detail and the array of talent that goes into this huge and multi-faceted production. It's an incredible space with multiple rooms where great attention to detail and design has clearly been given, being as true as possible to how these rooms (right down to the bathrooms!) would have looked in the 1920s. There are some fantastic actors, singers, dancers, musicians, and performers, and it blows me away how they can keep going despite the fact that, no doubt, every performance has its new challenges because the audience is so unpredictable. It can be a bit difficult to get a sense of a story line (mainly because it's so fun to just wander around and because it can be challenging to follow the characters when the place is so full of happy people milling about everywhere), but that really doesn't bother me because my favorite part is the very real feeling of being transported into another time and soaking up the feeling of being in the 1920s. It's magical, and when it was over I didn't want it to end, but I knew the actors (and crew/staff) must be exhausted -- we were in there for three and a half hours or so! \n\nIf I can attempt to sum it up, I would say it's part \"Chicago (the musical),\" part Charlie Chaplin, part vaudeville, part \"The Godfather,\" part \"Bugsy Malone,\" part \"Funny Girl,\" part Disneyland, part \"Cabaret (the musical),\" and 100% fun and magical, intriguing, and entertaining. The first time in, it'll knock your socks off (it sure did mine!). Second time, you have a better understanding of how it all works, and you can really start to sink your teeth in (and it likely will still knock your socks off!). I look forward to going again.\n\nGreat for tourists and visitors to the great city of SF (the story lines are geared towards what really was happening in SF in the 1920s), locals, theater goers, non-theater goers,  young and old alike. I highly recommend it and hope it will continue to run for a long, long time.", "author": "Peter B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-11", "description": "A solid 4 star experience.  Why not 5 star?  Well, it's easy to criticize, so let's first focus on what was GREAT about it...  \n\nThis is a really cool concept, and it's apparent they've worked hard to create a convincing atmosphere so we patrons are transported back in time.  It's really pretty fascinating to enter into the property and breath it all in - the sets, the costumes, the music.  Most guests embraced the recommendation to wear period attire, and every single person respected the 'no cell phone' rule (how refreshing).  I liked that my bar tab was set-up in advance, and the cocktails offered are authentic.\n\nMy friends & I started in the bar and were immediately enthralled with the live show before us.  The actors are a talented bunch, for sure, and have worked hard to give life to their characters.  After some scenes, we were guided to the cabaret, which we also greatly enjoyed.  The vaudeville emcee is a genius of his craft.  We found the showgirls to be mesmerizing.  But my hands down favorite was Velma, sultry chanteuse extraordinaire.  The only thing I did not like about the cabaret was at one point there was an impromptu dance party which made absolutely no sense and should be eliminated from the show as soon as possible (Boxcar Productions, I beg you to please make note).\n\nWe visited the third room- the Casino, but found it unenjoyable for a few reasons.  Roulette, craps, & handling casino chips creates a louder atmosphere by its very nature, making it easy to forget we're supposed to stay quiet for acting scenes.  Also, we were having fun playing blackjack (hence, facing the dealer and not wanting to turn to observe the scene in the middle of the room).  We hadn't even realized we were speaking above a whisper when we were shushed by the staff (a couple times).  It made us frustrated there wasn't a designated room we could enjoy our own conversation & have some cocktails.  We really enjoyed the acting that night, but the truth is, after a couple hours we experienced attention fatigue.  We hope they will eventually give patrons a room to relax and I personally think this casino would be the ideal space.\n\nThis now brings me to the script.  It covers serious subject matter that weighed heavily on people's minds at that time.  The scenes we watched were filled with anguish, sadness, & conflict.  I felt my eyes wet with tears more than once.  I craved a break from the heaviness, and from reading other reviews here, it's clear other patrons feel the same.  I hope the writers will insert more lighthearted story lines.  There are a few scenes in which you may find yourself breaking a smile, but those moments are rare and also seemed to be based in characters' deep-rooted pain.  That said, I would like to reiterate again how talented the actors are.  I particularly enjoyed the soap salesman at the bar.  And Velma- Velma forever!\n\nMy Likes...\n- This is a rare opportunity to experience a bygone era.  Great sets, great costumes, great actors, great music.  I ate it up.\n- We went out for drinks in our costumes/outfits beforehand, and received a gazillion compliments from people who were fascinated with us.\n- The story lines are all based in SF, and so there are references to the extended bay area.  We got a kick out of this.\n- The cocktails offered are from the era, and the setting up your tab in advance allows an easy system to order drinks and be billed later.\n- The staff was incredibly helpful.  When we needed their help, they guided us around and pointed out things we might have otherwise missed.\n\nMy Dislikes...\n- The check-in process was lengthy, and having a couple of dozen patrons waiting outside in Gatsby-type attire inadvertently advertises the club's location.\n- I spent $50 to purchase a cabaret table in advance.  As it turns out, the room had ample seating with half the chairs remaining empty.   \n- I spent $60 to purchase casino chips in advance.  As it turns out, I could have purchased chips there and really needed only one or two ($10-20)\n- I spent a week practicing my Charleston dance moves, and then the cabaret had a dance party featuring modern songs (huh???)\n- The story lines are too dark, sometimes rather explosive.  There was no room offered to just relax and have a cocktail without a scene bursting in.\n\nWhy would someone give it a 1-star review?  That baffles me.  Even if this is not your cup of tea, I can't imagine why anyone would want to bash it.  I'm sorry they disliked it as much as they did.  As for me- I hope the production company makes some changes to the things I pointed out, but over all, I greatly enjoyed the experience and I definitely plan to go back.", "author": "Tutie T."}

However, I have to say that I don't think I would recommend the show to others.  I went with my wife and another couple, all of us did a great job getting dressed for the period.  We had a great dinner prior to the show in North Beach and received many compliments on our attire.  This part of the evening was wonderful, and we enjoyed all of the reactions we got from tourists and locals alike.  \n\nWe arrived at the secret destination at our appointed time with many others who were excited to be attending the show.  We were told the rules (no talking/no electronics) and directed to our entry leading to the cocktail lounge. The performance started off well with some interesting dialogue between the bartenders and some of the \"bar regulars(actors)\".  However, the performance turned weirdly morbid.  I won't be a spoiler and detail the specifics, but the scene turned screamingly truly dark and weird.  One of my party told me later she saw an audience member in tears, not exactly what you anticipate going into a \"Speakeasy\". \n\nThe casino likewise interjected really disjointed segments of screeching negativity. It was also odd trying to be patrons of a casino, but being told to whisper or not to talk. While the casino game operators would deal the cards/spin the wheel, they did not seem to be in the spirit of the Speakeasy.  Likewise, the ladies who handled the cocktails were not included in the \"Speakeasy\" spirit. It seems a shame, because I think the casino, if handled in a less scripted, more improv manner could be a real interesting kind of free form theater that truly integrated the audience into the scene. \n\nThe cabaret was the most fun, particularly when they got the audience up and dancing, but this part of the show also seemed to be forced to weave in segments of depression to keep it from being a truly enjoyable experience.  \n\nThe Speakeasy's producer/director clearly have the right to stage whatever tone of show they choose to, but my group left very surprised by what a dark show it was. Clearly the actors and production staff have worked very hard.  However, I think when the audience comes, dressed in their Roaring 20's best, they are anticipating jazzy music, vaudeville, gangsters, debauchery, not a dark examination of the pain of war, PTSD, death of a son, child labor, women being abused, etc.  If the show had a different tone, I think my wife and I would be repeat patrons, but I don't think we will return, nor recommend it to others.", "author": "Blake M."}

Unfortunately, this \"new and improved\" air conditioned Speakeasy is not very fun at all.  SO many rules and regulations, you can't really move about freely unless you get late entry, you can't gamble or order a drink if one of the actors is about to do a poorly written \"scene\", you can't speak to each other without being shushed.  I understand it's a Speakeasy, but please.  The actors are taking themselves way too seriously for an amateur show.  Yes, you are paying over a hundred dollars each (with tokens and a reserved seat which you don't need) to watch amateurs.\n\nBest part of the night was when the waitress told me if I moved she would give my drink to someone else and still charge me anyway.  I never planned on moving because I really wanted to play black jack until they closed the table and told me I had to move.  Really?\n\nIf they're going to charge over $100 person (that's with chips and a seat for the first act of the show) they need to learn to entertain people and allow the audience to have fun.  \n\nI've been following Boxcar Theatre for years and have even been to two other Speakeasy experiences that were insanely awesome.

Ultimately I was not disappointed; it's terrific entertainment, despite having begun in the bar and bearing witness to an overly heavy handed skit of post world war one angst. That was a brief uh! oh! moment where my friends and I were a tiny bit concerned. Moving forward: the actors are really quite talented and focused. The cabaret was hilariously corny and slapstick. The chorus girls were curvy and almost kewpie like. How did they find so many dancers without tattoos? Velma the chanteuse was like seeing Catharine Zeta Jones in Chicago. And the MC? We loved him! The set design is worthy. The flow between rooms is a mite awkward but did not stop our progress.\n\nThe casino might be better served by allowing the guests to play a bit more without violent character interactions. Frankly, what stops me from giving the whole show 5 stars is the raging blast of aggro negativity that is present in many scenes. Jeesh! Keep it real but don't bring my night down with a headache from screaming pissed off actors. I know alot about the early 20's. Definitely not all wine and roses. WWI took a whole generation of young men. But the depression was not yet here. People had jobs and food on their plates.

With such source material in mind, one should expect an examination of the zeitgeist of the \"Roaring twenties\", replete with all its existential angst in a full blown, operatic format. Setting such gravitas aside, there is an occasional breath of fresh air in terms of comedy - but there is no doubt that much of the comedic relief is still understandably dark in nature.\n\nOverall, I felt the experience to be mostly well polished and immersive.It was a very enjoyable experience and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an immersive theatre experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-16", "description": "I'm absolutely addicted to interactive theatre experiences and even kickstarted this Boxcar Theatre endeavor when it popped up on my FB many moons ago. I've been looking forward to checking out The Speakeasy since I got their email at the beginning of the year, and even bought a plane ticket specifically to go to this little shindig. \n\nSo with all those disclaimers out of the way...\n\nTheir last performances are in June (special deals for Wed night), so give yourself this little indie theatre treat before they leave the building. If you think you're familiar with this type of experience, you'll be surprised. I was.\n\nThis is a much smaller and more intimate production than Temple Studios' shows like Speak No More. So comparisons are unwarranted. You're also not a masked figure here. The characters can see you. So it's not trying to be the same thing at all.\n\nSo here's what I got: 8 PM tickets with assigned table seating, one bag of poker chips, and two slots for the after-party. All totally worth it.\n\n8 PM entry was perfect. All patrons are actually expected to enjoy the cabaret for a set amount of time before the \"show\" truly begins and you're led into the other rooms. Since you can't really wander until the cabaret completes, 8 PM gives you time to sample the stage show, enjoy a few drinks, and get yourself situated into the pageantry of it all.\n\n**Note: Your ticket time changes where you actually enter. 8 PM patrons go through a different door than earlier patrons. It's a very nice touch on their part to have multiple points of entry.\n\nThey stagger individual parties when giving directions from the start point. I appreciate this, so you don't just end up following one another. It's actually a little adventure in and of itself just trying to find the speakeasy in the first place. So the atmosphere is being built up even before you arrive. When we first questioned a certain individual on where to go, there were actually quite a few other patrons dressed up and mulling around (to the interest of many passer-by's), waiting for their opportunity to ask for the same help. So don't wait for someone to walk up to you, they won't. You'll have to take initiative.\n\nIn response to some reviews:\n\n- Yes. The drinks all taste the same and are borderline unpalatable. Consider that most illegal alcohol was bathtub gin and moonshine, and you'll begin to appreciate the rather authentic experience, haha. Though kudos to the bartender for whipping up a few concoctions \"more suitable for a lady.\"\n\n- Yes, the cabaret show is cheesy and irritating. I honestly think that's because in this created world, the speakeasy is run by a sleazy proprietor who dominates his generally meek stage girls, conceals a dirty casino in a back room, and could care less about your \"good time.\" It makes sense to the context of the story that these aren't first-rate acts.\n\nDefinitely stay for the after-party, if only for an hour. Though it was so much fun, we ended up staying till they kicked us out... Not only will it give you a deeper appreciation for what goes into this show, you'll also get a chance to mingle with the actors and staff (more than 80 people make this show happen each night), have many of your curiosities answered, see the scenery in a different light, and take pictures inside. So dress to the 10s.\n\n--\n\nMy suggestions to the production should they decide to apply this concept elsewhere in the future:\n\n1) Slow motion during particular soliloquies was a nice touch. However, not all actors were doing their part to maintain this effect, and it was lost to more than a few people. The bartender (and casino dealers, etc) should also be affected. You can time it so he's speaking with a particular character before another's monologue starts up. If he's taking an order or conversing with a patron, have another actor interrupt the exchange and get his attention.\n\n2) What you need for the next production are speakers linked with microphones on the actors. Definitely get a good sound engineer. That way, their voices penetrate into the room and are audible to even the casual listener. Even after putting a spotlight on the characters and gathering the audience's attention, lots of dialogue was lost to the crowd many times. For me in the lounge area, even while seated on the chaise, it was difficult to deliberately listen to the conversation happening at the bistro table directly adjacent.\n\n3) Lastly, I know that many of you have clown and improv schooling. Still, given the direct face-to-face interaction, this is the type of show that requires an actor to be on their toes all night. And a few of you need to work on how to gracefully flub lines. When you respond to a verbal stumble by correcting yourself, you draw the more discerning patrons out of this carefully constructed fairytale. Don't worry about repeating your lines the same every time. It's about effectively getting your character's point across. Sell that and you're set.", "author": "Elizabeth H."}

I've seen a lot of unconventional theater, but I'd never been to an immersive production before. I was totally blown away.\n\nA few notes:\n\nI got my tickets using the TodayTix app, and they were WAY cheaper that way. (Still a bit of a splurge, but not nearly as much as the face value.) You can only book up to a week or two in advance, but it seems like they almost always have tickets if you check the weekend before you plan on going. You also don't get to choose your starting location like you would if you bought them on the website, but the box office was happy to oblige when I called the day before and asked to be seated in the cabaret.\n\nThat said, the starting location doesn't matter all that much. I requested the cabaret because I was worried I wouldn't get to see it otherwise, but there were plenty of open seats throughout the night. After the first forty minutes or so, you can spend as much time as you want in any of the other areas.\n\nI was surprised by how much of the action took place outside of the \"main\" rooms. I'd recommend spending some time exploring the hallways, because you'll likely come across a secret room or a scene you'd otherwise miss. \n\nUnless you make a point of following one particular storyline, you're going to get bits and pieces of a lot of storylines. I thought this would be confusing, but the story arcs were surprisingly easy to follow even if you miss some parts. \n\nThe drinks are expensive, but good. I had a Manhattan and a Velvet Sea, and really liked them both. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's best to eat before you get there. The food is really pricey if you want anything more than a small snack.\n\nI was a little skeptical about the no phones rule, but I didn't miss my phone at all. (For those who are wondering, they make you keep all electronics in a sealed bag.) It really added to the authenticity of the night, and anyway, you wouldn't have your phone out during a more conventional theater performance, would you?\n\nStay until the end.

My issue is being overcharged and management trying to blame the customer! They made up some fake story about how the male manager remembered our table and how once he explained the menu to us we 'excitedly' ordered the better bottle of champagne. The thing is, we had a female server who did not explain the menu to us, as the show had started and she could barely hear us. On top of that, they are charging us for bottles of Champagne we did not drink, we had Gloria Ferrer and the bill says Roederer Estate.

I have been to a number of immersive theatre events in New York when I lived there and absolutely loved them so I was excited to go to Speakeasy. One of the things I loved about the experiences I had prior was the staff was alluring, adventurous, inviting, and intriguing. This was not the case at Speakeasy. Staff were cordial like they would be at a restaurant. We began the evening in the bar and listened to several conversations which were a bit dull at first then picked up some interesting historical significance later on. Okay, maybe this will be fun we thought. Then we went to the casino where we were encouraged to play craps, which we did, then lost all our money which is to be expected. The cabaret was the next room which was entertaining but not so much that we wanted to stay more than ten minutes. We didn't find any secret rooms or have any real engagement with the staff. We stayed three hours, all in all we both felt it was kind of meh. It's certainly better than sitting at a bar but definitely not the kind of fun immersive theatre we were hoping for.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Aside from the three main rooms - the cabaret, the casino, and the bar - you can eavesdrop on the dealings of the speakeasy's owner in his office, and watch various dramas unfold in the dancers' dressing room or in the tucked-away sitting room.

The space is just the right size to explore and know that there's always interesting things happening wherever you are. Having a mental map of the space also makes it easier to follow characters from room to room or follow up on a hunch you have about something that might happen. The acting was great (especially the MC of the cabaret -- hilarious). Interesting characters and storylines, and all well-themed for the era. The live music was a surprising treat.\n\nTo us, the casino was the least interesting room, so I'd recommend not buying chips in advance. You can always get them there if you want to, but we were so busy following stories that we never ended up using the chips we bought.\n\nI made the mistake of re-reading the Yelp reviews for this right before the performance, and they were so negative that it actually had me a little less excited to go. But my experience was very different from those, e.g. we were never shh'd because we were engrossed in the performance and rarely talked, the dark scene referred to in the bar was my favorite of the whole performance, etc.\n\nHaving experienced Sleep No More, there are definitely similarities but many more differences, nearly all positive in my opinion. One I'll call out specifically is that it's very enjoyable whether you're a story chaser or just want to relax in one room for a period of time and let the entertainment come to you. Chasing stories is rewarding, but it's also very fun to just enjoy things as they happen in each room. I highly recommend going, and will likely go again myself to follow different characters next time.\n\nThe only 2 negative experiences that I'll share in hopes the feedback is useful to the show are:\n1. The check in process was chaos and needs to change. Our telegram said to show up on time and be discreet, and with staggered entry times we assumed it would be well-coordinated, so we killed a few minutes to show up exactly at our appointed time. We wanted to be discreet and not approach while the staff member was talking to others as requested, but after 4-5 other groups cut ahead of us we ended up having to stand right next to them to prevent any other groups from cutting ahead of us, which means we heard the same jokes and spiel several time. We ended up wasting 15 minutes trying to get checked in (while the other staff members had no wait at all), which is 15 more minutes we should have been enjoying the performance. As a result, I entered the performance very annoyed, which is definitely not the mood you want to be in for this.\n\n2. Without spoiling anything, the scene in the cabaret that involves a lot of audience participation made no sense. Why work so hard to maintain the 1920s theme and then ruin it like that? We were both really confused after that and what it was supposed to accomplish.", "author": "Justin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "Huge disappointment. The employee on the phone who we bought tickets from exclaimed this would blow Sleep No More out of the water. Opposite was true - this is cheesy community theater that pales next to the real production values of Sleep No More. \n\nTo start, the space is incredibly small. It's not even the size of 1 of the 4 floors for Sleep No More. It's essentially 3 rooms plus 1 standing area. We had seen all of the areas within an hour and aimlessly wandered the rest of the night trying to find something interesting to watch. \n\nThe theater room is the best part, but if you don't pay the $10 up charge for reserved seats, they won't even let you in. The rules weren't made clear so we initially entered and stood in the back. The host immediately asked us to leave as there's apparently no standing. We came back later, and when they finally offered us some seats out of pity, we were immediately kicked out by actors who needed the seats. It's crazy to pay over $100 for a base ticket and need to pay up-charges to see the full show. Given how small the space is, this just doesn't work. Suggest they drop the up-charge entirely or add a large block of free seating. \n\nActing varies. The worst part was when they tried to imitate Sleep No More with dramatic physical scenes. It was so stilted and uncomfortable that our group had to look away. \n\nThere is also nothing to explore or interact with. They advised us not to go into any areas marked private but didn't do a thorough job of marking all of the off-limits spaces. Best part was a group that discovered an elevator behind a curtain. They took it up, and a minute later, joined us again after it took them nowhere. I also found a small, unmarked door and opened it up, only to discover a young actor waiting in the dressing room for his scene. Add in all of the rules around seating in the theater and a grumpy security guard who tossed out our friend's bottled water while grunting \"It's 1923\" - interactive this is not. \n\nAnd the worst offense is the show is way too long. It's over 3.5 hours, and as it inched past 11:00, I looked up to the balcony to see an employee passed out asleep. Smart guy. Wanting to do the same, we tracked down our friends who confirmed they were tired too and we bolted for the front door. We ended up interrupting a scene outside the entrance as we struggled to find our coats in the dark. An actor did break character to help us find our stuff - our escape ended up the most interactive and exciting part of the night. \n\nIt is true we saw the show while it's still in previews and that they have time to tweak some items I mention above (marking all off-limit areas, better seating in the theater, asking employees not to fall asleep on the job) but the core issues are endemic. The space is too small, the dialog hammy, and the story wholly uninteresting. And when the most memorable part of the night is a group ending up on a service elevator to nowhere, the show is a failure. \n\nSave your money to see Sleep No More when you're in NYC. This is one speakeasy that's better left underground.", "author": "Brian K."}

I was looking to take my girlfriend somewhere special our anniversary date and I heard from a friend of a friend about this entertainment venue called \" The SpeakEasy SF\". It's fully immersive theatrical experience that transport you back in time to the early 1920's. This is a formal attire (Roaring 20's/Steampunk cosplay) exploration into what it would have been like to drink, gamble and watch a true vaudevillian experience. When we entered this \"WestWorld like\" world of illicit gangsters and sexy showgirls through a secret passageway behind an old fashioned clock (pretty cool). Everyone's experience is different depending on where you choose to begin. What really surprised me was they even let us peek backstage in the dressing rooms and we could watch and listen to the dancers before and after they hit the stage. It's like watching a play that completely surrounds you and you can walk anywhere and experience a different parts of the overarching storyline. Every time you enter the SpeakEasy it's a different experience depending on what and where you choose to watch. There is nothing in the world like this. This is the best way to feel what's it like to live in the 1920's short of being on the Star Trek Enterprise's holodeck. Must see to believe!", "author": "Michael I."}

It is really the perfect evening. Everyone comes dressed up in swanky 1920's attire (or the best they can do) and as we wait to enter the top secret location,  there is this immediate atmosphere of excitement. As soon as you enter into the space it is like you are teleported back to the 1920's. They have done an incredible job building romantic, authentic interiors. \n\nWe began in the cabaret which was really well done. The MC was your classic cabaret MC, with a white painted face, telling jokes fitting for the 1920's. The chorus girls were fantastic! It's great that you can get cocktails of the time period at any time as well.\n\nFrom there we got to experience the casino (did well gambling:) and explored all these other amazing little rooms they have set up where you will stumble upon scenes that happen around you. Sometimes you get pulled into the action, sometimes you just witness a beautiful artsy, out of time dance moment, sometimes you hear beautiful dialogue as two characters fight in a room that you can only see through a small window. \n\nOne of the most magical, effective, and fun evenings I've had in a while. It may be pricey, but it's really like getting a costume party, a night out at a bar, a night at a casino, a theatre show, and a concert all at once.

There were, in fact technical problems, mainly related to lighting and cues, but I got the sense at multiple points that even with the kinks worked out, this would not be a polished, buttoned-down experience.\n\nA few cast members were great, but other casting was not so great.  It was supposed to be a period experience (1920's themed) but the actors rarely demonstrated speech or mannerisms that seemed convincing.  They missed opportunities to invest more money in wardrobes that would have been convincing.  There was a casino element to it and those cast as dealers were slow and barely showed proficiency in the games, especially blackjack.  When I tried to tip a dealer with a chip, instead of remaining in character, she laughed and reminded me that it was fake money. \n\nIt simply wasn't a cohesive experience.  There was no real plot, and it wasn't clear when the experience was supposed to end.  Visitors are instructed aggressively to speak only when spoken to by a cast member, but there was not very much opportunity to interact because it was so scripted.  By the end, I understood what they were trying to do and how it was supposed to feel, but it simply missed the mark.\n\nFinally, This was a mediocre experience for the price.  Tickets were around $100 apiece.  Drinks were yummy but small and ~$13 apiece with mandatory gratuity.  Gambling chips ere $10 per person, and dinner wasn't served.  The two of us spent a total of about $300 on the experience itself and by the time we paid for a babysitter and grabbed something to eat afterward, it was a $500 date.\n\nI wanted to like it--I really did, and I had a good time because I always have a good time with my husband but it could have been better.

The show has always left us seriously impressed by the quality of the characters, story, music, and atmosphere. Though some of the storylines are indeed dark (PTSD experienced by a WWI veteran, parents of a soldier grieving the loss of their son in the war, gambling addiction, etc.) some of the characters are hilarious and witty, too. This mix creates, to me, a more authentic feel. Do reserve seats in the cabaret for at least one part of the night: the MC and singers and dancers are not to be missed. And make sure you dress to the nines, preferably in period attire, as they don't let you in if you look like a bum (nor should they).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-12", "description": "Decent, enjoyable show but I have a few complaints about it. Honestly if I hadn't seen Sleep No More first I probably would have thought this was better, but unfortunately it didn't come close to SNM. Sorry to make the comparison but I can't really help it.. I went in expecting an intense, interactive experience and even though I had a good time, I was left wanting something more.\n\nPros:\n* Loved that everyone was dressed up and the atmosphere was immersive. It's a truly fantastic concept and they did a great job with the set, costumes, and acts.\n* Lively vibe. Don't have to stay quiet the whole time. You can talk all you want in the casino.\n* Drinks everywhere. They were pretty good too. A little pricey but you'd expect that.\n* The cabaret host guy was awesome. Some other great actors also.\n\nCons:\n* Entry. The concept of meeting up with a stranger who tells you how to get in is obviously intended to invoke the speakeasy feeling, but the execution was terrible. What ends up happening is there is a large group of people lined up in the street waiting to talk to the dudes... definitely not authentic speakeasy experience. And of course there were idiots that cut the line, and it seemed like our entry times didn't matter at all. Also the actor you meet up with did the same speech about the rules for everyone and it really slowed things down. Not to mention you can hear him doing the speech like 5 times over because you're waiting in line close to him.. so goofy. They need to make it more efficient by a) staggering entry times more; b) having more people to meet up with and in locations farther apart from each other; and/or c) shorten the speech or figure out a way to give the speech to multiple groups at once.\n* Initial act. We were in the cabaret first, which I imagine is the best choice because you have acts to watch. It just seemed to go on for a long time and we found ourselves wondering when the 'real' show would start and when we'd be able to go around an interact. We thought having an early entry time would give us more time to explore (this was the case for SNM) but really it just meant we sat in the cabaret longer until everyone was given leave to walk around at the same time.\n* So small. Only 3 main rooms, a hallway, 1 small 'hidden' room, and 1 small room you can look in but can't go in. Felt super tiny compared to SNM, like you were done seeing everything there was to see in a half hour.\n* Very few interactive set pieces and things to do besides walking between the 3 rooms, drinking, and waiting for acts to happen. There is minimal exploration involved, no drawers to open, nothing to read, no props to play with, no mysteries to uncover.\n* Casino chips. I paid over $100 to attend this event and you can't give me a couple measly casino chips as part of my entry? You have to pay $10 extra to get some chips, and the games get boring fast considering they're games you can play anywhere (roulette, blackjack, etc), and winning means nothing. They could at least have offered some cheap little rewards or even a free drink if you win enough chips.\n* I agree with another reviewer that a few of the actors/actresses did not do a good job speaking and acting in a 20's manner. \n\nIt was a fun evening but far from mind-blowing. I think it will probably improve over time though.", "author": "Vee N."}

You're not watching from a stage. You're in the middle of it and move through the rooms throughout the night. It combines period style entertainment with a bit of historical teachings. The drama builds around a surprisingly large cast of characters. Very well written and produced. Very talented actors and musicians. Have some fun and come in period style clothing.", "author": "Mark C."}

And you should go.\n\nThe Speakeasy is an innovative theatre production cleverly disguised as a 1920's prohibition saloon, complete with flapper girls, gambling, police raids, and great, great singing, and even better acting. The experience runs from 7/8 pm (depending on your entry time) to exactly 11 pm; within those hours it's a choose-your-own-adventure philosophy where you wander throughout the space, lingering in whichever room you prefer (be it the cabaret, the casino hall, the dressing room perhaps), not knowing if the person next to you is another guest or an actor. You may find secret rooms, be privy to the latest gossip, witness brawls; but whatever you'll find, at the end of the night, you'll be fleeing from the cops.\n\nOr, as my boyfriend David would describe it: \"You see, Copper, sometimes you gotta find the perfect place to look at dames and molls, and get canned, corked, tanked, primed, scrooched, jazzed, zozzled, plastered, owled, embalmed, lit, potted, ossified or fried to the hat. What does that mean? It mean's to get drunk, sheik. And getting drunk at a gin mill like The Speakeasy, surrounded by those gams, listening to the music and enjoying a bit of the 1920's is the right way to spend your evening.\"\n\nNo photos allowed in the event, so take pics before and after. Period costumes not required, but strongly encouraged. They are sold out every night for the rest of March and April, but there are some availability in May and June yet! Groups of 15 get 15% off when purchased together.", "author": "Liuyin S."}

We had to sit there watching the actors all around us and we couldn't move. I hadn't realized that it would be 90% show.\n-The cocktail menu was just a brief summary of ingredients, so I got a drink with Campari, even though I hate Campari.\n-The guests costumes were better than the actors.\n-The actors weren't all that good.\n-The gambling was so cramped and busy that it was very hard to partake. \n-I got yelled at when I wandered around.\n\nHere's what I liked:\n-Most guests were dressed up. \n-The comedians were funny.\n-The 5 minutes of dancing was awesome.", "author": "Kaya C."}

It is basically several story lines that happen around you and a huge cast of embedded characters coming and going from each room. You don't really participate. The plot line is set and you observe. People really dress up for this, which makes it fun and the time goes by quickly. We started in the Cabaret  and the show was good! They don't repeat anything so there's always something to see. Next time I want to start in the Bar. The Casino is also fun but note that you can't use your winnings for anything it's just for fun. The drinks are good but a little pricey, but given the large cast and the musicians and sets it's an expensive production.

The 2 main problems for me were being trapped in the building (on purpose) at the end of the night and not getting enough of any storyline to understand anything by the end of the night.  (And why was I given a flower to wear?  Was I suppose to be at the show by a certain time?  How would I know the time - no watches, phones of course, and I didn't notice any clocks in the house). I won't give examples so as not to ruin anything for anyone else, but I didn't get enough of ANY storyl ine to understand anything of what happened by the end of the night (and I was there at the very very beginning).  It would have been better if there was some type of expected rotations through the space to get a base of information, then allow for random wandering.  And if you don't know about the secret spaces you miss out.  Then at the end of the night I wanted to leave the theatre area but wasn't allowed, was told \"there was an accident to clean up\".  When we got BS/no answers of why we couldn't exit from either direction I asked if this was part of the schtick or please tell me why I can't leave the building.  Eventually a lead/manager of some sort came by and asked if I could just wait a few minutes - at this point I felt trapped and said no, I wanted to leave right then. They did let me out only to find out they were wrapping up the evening and letting people out in groups.  Why didn't they just say so?  The double cherry on top is that I set up my bar tab before their noted time (got a confirmation it worked) then got there and they didn't have my \"charging wooden nickel\" - okay, things happen so I give them my credit card then, all seems to go well for that evening's charges then 2 days later I get a \"the card didn't go through, click here to pay\" message.  Ah jeez, okay (why didn't they check the run that night - I'm no where near the limit and had other cards too) but (make it triple cherry on top) their online payment system wants to keep my account open and I have to go somewhere else to deactivate it.  What?!?  Final tip - don't go with a large group, you can't stick together, you don't have a shared experience and some people get left behind - literally - all alone not knowing where anyone went.

I was listening to 1920s jazz for weeks afterward to transport me back. Thrilled to report that this new show is bigger and better than ever. I love the amount of energy this team has poured into trying to create as authentic an experience as they can; there are so many beautiful details to take in from the music (their live band is so talented) dialogue to the costumes and the sets, even down to creating authentic drinks from the era. The entire cast offers delightful performances and I can't wait to bring all my friends with me when I come back again and again to try to experience each storyline in its entirety. A few familiar characters are back as well as new ones, and the cabaret acts are so much fun (especially if you're lucky enough to catch a certain special dance party that invites audience participation). Almost dizzying how much is happening at once and the orchestration they manage to pull off is an impressive feat. I also can't stress enough how refreshing it is to be in a space where people aren't on their cell phones! I left mine at home since I live in the neighborhood and it was so nice to just be fully present and take in the show without seeing everyone around me trying to take pictures or scrolling on their cellphones.

You leave feeling like you were part of the show itself and actually learning a lot about the 1920s era. It is a very unique and fantastic experience and everyone on the team played their roles SO WELL. Very impressed with everyones performance and being able to play their parts for a good three hours! It must be so hard to do when the circumstances and people around you are different every night. All the actors and actresses were perfect for their roles and you really become immersed in each character's emotions and story lines.\nI wouldn't recommend going to the show on a first date since there are so many things happening but with a small group of friends, it's a delightful experience.\nDefinitely dress up in the 1920s era- ladies, wear something flapper girl-ish (head-bands, feathers, vintage dresses, and red lipstick) and men shouldn't be afraid to wear a suit, a bow tie, and even a bowler hat. It definitely enhances the overal experience of the night for everyone there. Make sure to be on time and head over as soon as you can so you can get a seat to watch the first third of the show.\nYou could order drinks throughout the night and there were also non-alcoholic drinks like ginger beer and sarsaparilla. Plus, there was a room where you could play Blackjack and Craps. You were given a coin before entering the building and you could exchange it for a purple bag of tokens to play. It was great being able to watch the show and take a break and play a few light-hearted games (not for real money).\nThere are a lot of things happening around you and the whole time you should be whispering and not talking very loud at all- otherwise, you will be hushed.\nThe songs were all great and by the end of the night, everyone was singing along to the last number.

Both visits were (slightly) different, and I picked up on much more of the story plot the second time around. However, it's an entirely different vibe and atmosphere than NYC's Sleep No More. Aside from following actors around (in a much more compact space) there is no comparison really. Don't expect the same type of experience as Sleep No More.\n\nThe storyline throughout the night is a bit, err-uhh... mehh. I guess it's subjective, but I'll speak on the positives that was enjoyed by all in our group:\n\nA+ for creating an excellent \"speakeasy atmosphere\" paired with everyone dressed to the nine's. The dress code is taken very serious.\nB+ for the gambling area (even though it's not real money and the dealers lack personality--still fun).\nA- for the crazy-strong drinks. They are humorous when you ask what type of booze/wine/beer is actually in your drink. (Mystery never solved and that's A-ok).\nB for the actors/actresses interacting with you and making you feel part of the story. My second time around I was approached a lot and felt much more a part of the story than the first time.\nA+ for the effort in offering a unique San Francisco experience that is fun to attend with a group of friends.\n\nOverall the storyline can be a bit agitating and dark at points... and some of the singing/dancing/choreography could be polished up a notch, but overall  it's definitely worth checking out and can be as fun as you make it.", "author": "DJ P."}

I have a background in immersive theater (I even interned on Sleep No More, which many people reference in comparison) and all of my expectations were met or exceeded, I spent the evening in a magical, vibrant, interesting, fun, wonderland of history. Of course the scale is not as large as some productions, but I thought 3 main rooms, plus a few smaller areas to explore, were done to perfection, appropriate for a speakeasy theme, and kept us busy all night. You could easily sit in just the cabaret all night and have a great time.\nA few thing I wish I would have known:\n-Don't bother to reserve a table, unless you have a big group. We reserved a table for part 1 and didn't even get sat in the seats we reserved (better ones actually), plus every time we came back to the cabaret there were plenty of seats and no one stopping us from sitting anywhere we wished. \n-Also, I have no idea how they distinguish between parts 1, 2 and 3, or how someone with a reserved table for parts 2 or 3 would know when their reservations begin. We just eventually left the cabaret when there was a pause and we were ready to explore more\n-Get casino chips, it really is fun to play and 1 set for 10$ will do it. it's a nice pause if you get tired of watching the action. Scenes do happen and interrupt the game, but we found plenty of time to gamble.\n-I needed to make dinner reservations in advance but wanted them to be walkable--not knowing the location made that hard. So let me just say it's near the Colombus hub of North Beach \n\nI appreciated the touches of no real money, no phones/cameras, and period-appropriate drinks. And everyone really dressed up! Kudos to the audience! It was fun not to know who was a character or not. There isn't much in the way of character interaction though. Shout out to Velma, the MC and Mac the bartender for being my favorite characters. \n\nA few cons, mostly that other people have mentioned:\n-Entry. It's true, there's just a bunch of dressed up people waiting to talk to the guy and hearing the rules multiple times until it's their turn. However the effect of going from a dinghy alleyway staircase into a club was awesome!\n-The plot. I have NO idea what happens in this story. it's not necessary to have a good time, heck, maybe there isn't even an overarching plot--but I thought we were really ambitious in traversing the rooms and we only saw fragments of people's stories and were never aware of how most tied together. It sounds like some people in these reviews saw too much plot and that it was negative.\n-Drink service was pretty slow. We didn't get the free drinks everyone else entering in the cabaret got, and it took 15-20 minutes to get my first drink from the server. At the bar, there's a good chance the bartender is acting in a scene and unable to serve you. it got better throughout the night, maybe as they got through an initial rush? \n\nA few cons other people have mentioned which I don't think are valid:\n-This is NOT Sleep no more and you shouldn't expect it to be. Mostly it's much smaller, but among other differences, set interaction is not really a part of this show.\n-The website is very clear about speaking \"easy\" (not talking) being one of the rules. You should expect to be watching more than partying/talking.", "author": "Eve B."}

I really believe everyone was working hard and doing their best. But it was still a terrible experience.\nWe went to the Speakeasy on 9/29 for my birthday. In addition to tickets, we purchased table reservations for the cabaret and casino chips. I wish we could get our money back, as we literally left well before the show ended. None of us felt there was anything to stay for (plus, it was past 11:30pm and still not over?!). Not interesting, not interactive, not organized. It was a waste of $700+ for my family to go and a poor birthday experience. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone!\n\nPros:\n- Costumes - fun to see everyone dressed up and definitely in the spirit of the event. \n- Check-in - It was a little crowded, but I asked for an earlier time and so I think we had no issues. Our clue was to check in with a person holding a red umbrella. The umbrella was a bit hidden but really, that was fine and continued to be fun.\n- Environment/Staging - the space is actually done amazingly well and you really do feel like you're in the 20s. Kudos to the set design team and props team. \n- Casino - the casino was probably the most fun for our group, but don't bother buying chips ahead of time.\n\nCons:\n- Purchasing process - I've never been to a show like this and was very confused about how it works. You could get reservations, but then you could wander around. There was nothing to really help a newbie. \n- Show - The show was horrible and IMPOSSIBLY hard to follow. It was also incredibly dark and disturbing. I agree with someone else's comments about expecting a fun entertaining evening and getting a dark, disturbing show. The impression first given when purchasing tickets (knock and give a password) and checking-in (find xyz) and even dressing up give the expectation that this is a fun, roaring 20s kind of show. This isn't the type of set up I would expect for such a dark show. I was expecting fun murder mystery type show and I got something more akin to Schindler's List. This was not the birthday memory I wanted!\n- Organization - it was impossible to tell when one act ended and another one began. We started in the bar and had reservations for act 2 in the cabaret. At one point in time, there was a long pause in the bar and a number of people moved from one location to another. So we thought the act had changed. Considering we purchased reservations in advance at $10 per person, we figured that was the end of the act and we should go to the next room. We arrived in the cabaret and had to wait to be seated - I'm still not sure if it was because we switched rooms too soon or if our table was taken by other guests who just moved from room to room or didn't leave from the previous act. The lack of transition for acts was an issue the entire evening. It wouldn't have been a big deal if we were told to just explore, but by setting up the expectation of acts during the purchasing process and PAYING for the cabaret tables and casino chips, we expected to go to different locations at different times.\n- Service/Drinks - drinks were strong, but not very good. And the service was poor. We were waiting constantly for a waiter and even after ordering, our drinks took too long. The built in 18% gratuity is ridiculous, especially for such poor service. We also all felt there should have been some kind of food served - even snacks.\nBathrooms - I think there was only one set of bathrooms. Thankfully, I hit the restroom when there were no crowds.", "author": "Lisa V."}

Of all the events and things to do in SF, this is one of the best. It's going to be a massive hit. My advice: don't skip out on getting dressed up.

She had seen \"Sleep No More\" in NYC and found similarities, although Speakeasy's venue is considerably more compact. The experience was not as I had expected, and certainly not your usual SF theater evening.  To fully enjoy your show, and I do recommend that you go, follow the instructions carefully.  Dress as requested but don't feel you have to over-do it.  You want to be part of the staging.  Do explore the various venues as the many story lines play out across the rooms.  If you take a liking to one in particular, follow the actors.  I won't say more about the show itself as it would spoil the discovery that is so much a part of the evening.  Be prepared for drama, comedy, singing, dancing, decent drinks, and great fun.\n\nThe show runs long and the rooms are warm, but don't let that keep you from the after-show party.  The group is talented, delightful, interesting, and engaging. Speakeasy has been extended which is an indication of the quality of the production and the fun you will have.", "author": "Phil S."}

The performance is very interactive and unique in that it draws the audience into the illicit behavior of the 1920 era's backroom saloons (think of Great Gatsby etc).\n\nYou will be notified via text to arrive at a certain place and time with a secret password.  Once you find your contact at that location you exchange information and given a location and another password to enter the establishment.\n\nThis is where the fun begins.\n\nThe outside of the place has something to be desired of but that is part of the whole appeal.  You knock on the door and give the person the password to enter.  Once inside the \"performances\" take place in several locations.  The main \"stage\" has a combination of singing and dancing, as well as, vaudeville acts from that era.  The second part of the location contains a \"hidden\" casino with a roulette, craps, and blackjack tables.  The back of the place has a small room which you can view events happening in the changing room and a bar/performance/sitting area.\n\nPerformers will be interacting in front and all around you.  It's a wonderful idea and concept because you become immersed in the various story lines.\n\nWe reserved a table in the front and watched a show with some wonderful singing, dance numbers, and comedy routines.  You may not recognize most of the songs from that time but as the night progresses you will eventually find a few nuggets that you will easily recall hearing from an old movie or television show.   I enjoyed listening to all of them and especially enjoyed the rendition of \"We have no Banana's Today.\"  I don't believe you could even create or sing that song nowadays as it would offend just about the whole ethnic makeup of SF but the tongue and cheek performance was absolutely marvelous!\n\nWe then moved to the back where we went to the \"casino\" room.  I literally blew everything on black and when the ball landed on red we made our way out to the back room.  The backroom contains a small stage with a piano, bar, and sitting room.  In the sitting room actors will be having conversations with each other and making performances on the small stage.  This is happening the same time performances are occurring in the front of the place on the main stage.\n\nKeep in mind that so much is happening around you that you can not possibly see and experience everything.  That's part of the appeal of the show is that each person sees things differently and not everybody catches the whole storyline.  I will not give too much away other than it was a wonderful evening and something I would highly recommend to others.  Several people left before the ending number but I recommend to stay to the last minute as it is a fun closing and if you are lucky enough to get invited to the \"after party\" to attend. \n\nI would suggest coming to the show in period attire as it helps create the mood of what you are about to see and experience.  The performance is about your experience in one night at an actual speakeasy.  It is presented in a way that draws you into that era of dancing girls, booze and all.", "author": "Johnny V."}

If you can't find a seat on the first floor there is a claustrophobic second floor mezzanine where you need to duck to avoid the ductwork.  \n\nThe first 1/3 of the show takes place on a stage where the Emcee and his side-kick tell corny jokes and sing typical 20's songs.  There are singing, dancing flappers and other shenanigans, like an unfathomably bad magician.  My husband was groaning so loudly during the show that I suggested it might be annoying to those around him.  He said he couldn't take the show one minute longer, so I stayed with 2 other friends.  Maybe this is authentic Speakeasy fare, but not entertaining to any of us.\n\nDuring the second 1/3 of the evening, you are allowed to move into another area with 3 very small rooms where you can gamble at one of three tables:  roulette, blackjack and craps.  Of course, even if you win you don't really make any money because you turn in your chips at the end of the night.  As the bouncer/doorman told me, \"you are on the edge of reality\".  \n\nDuring the final 1/3 of the show another room is opened where there's a bar and piano player.  Then ensues a little drama about a hysterical woman chasing her husband around the Speakeasy because he has brought their 11-year old daughter there and spent all his money on drinking and gambling.  Hackneyed subject.  Then many Depression era songs, like \"Once I Had a Railroad\", a fast-forward on the lives of the characters, i.e. \"he never saw his wife and child again\", \"102 and living in a retirement community\", etc.  \n\nYou aren't supposed to speak above a whisper, which in general inhibits conversation.  They are ending the show on June 21.  I was very disappointed because I read the great reviews, many of which were probably written by the performers.\n\nOne more thing, upon exiting the \"Speakeasy\" you will find yourself in the midst of the Tenderloin where most will not feel safe waiting for a taxi.  It took us about 15 minutes to get a cab at 10:15, during which time we were anxious about the crowds of locals congregating on corners.", "author": "Rene R."}

It's the closest thing that you'll get to getting into a time machine and getting transported back in time.  The space is an incredible re-creation of what a 1930's Speakeasy might have been like.  The attention to detail is astounding-- to the point where I truly felt \"immersed\" in the underground belly of Prohibition-era San Francisco. Perhaps most importantly, you are pulled into a world of characters--mob bosses, dancers, writers and just \"everyday\" 1920's people.   Because most of the guests are dressed in period costume, it's never entirely clear who is part of the cast, and who is not. That adds to the mystery. If you want to have a completely immersive experience of going back to 1923--and experience great music/dance entertainment, a bit of gambling excitement, great drinks and thought-provoking historical storylines....or just have an evening full of surprises and fun, The SpeakEasy is highly recommended!

Couple that with the mostly great reviews on yelp, and we were excited!  We dressed in period clothing and we looked fantastic. :-)\n\nOur show time was 9:00pm. The best part of the whole evening was the fun of tracking down the man with the yellow umbrella and giving our password. We were the first in our group to check in, promptly at 9pm as directed. We then proceeded to wait nearly 30 minutes in an alley with no direction. Finally, someone came by and said \"What? You gonna sit out here all night?!\"  When he realized no one had given us any direction, he was embarassed. \n\nHere's our synopsis:\n- Don't buy the 9pm tickets. At that hour, they have you enter through an alley instead of the clock shop. I think it would have been much more authentic had we entered through the clock shop.\n- The drinks are beyond horrible, sans the Guinness, unless you love whiskey. Had they simply had a better bar menu, we might've been able to stomach the rest of the evening. \n- The acting was at high school level, which got annoying quickly\n- There was no real plot to follow, so it never really captured our attention/interest\n- The room with the gambling was so tiny and so crowded, it wasn't even possible to walk inside let alone pull up to a table. \n\nOverall, it was a waste of our money and time.

I dunno what's going on here; all these people talking about drinking and gambling and fast women have got it wrong. This is Joe's Clock Shop, and as far as I know Joe makes and repairs fine clocks, nothing more. He fixed up my old pocketwatch just last night. Joe happens to be a pal of mine and I can't let folks go around besmirching his good name like this.\n\nIt's true you don't see many clock shops that stay open all night, but that just proves what a dedicated businessman Joe is. And it's true you see a lot of stylishly dressed people coming in and out of his establishment in the wee hours, but that's just because he attracts a high-class clientele. Some of the neighbors have complained about about noise and music, but I ask you, is it a crime if a working man plays  some music to pass the time? \n\nNow I've also heard that there's a lot of rowdy behavior that tends to happen in this neighborhood, and there are rumors of some illegal gin-dealing and gambling and what have you. It wouldn't surprise me if you could stumble on some kind of blind tiger joint if you asked the right people. But I wouldn't know anything about all that. And I'm sure Joe doesn't either.\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n...all right, fun times aside, maybe you're wondering why I'm giving this gig \"only\" three stars when most other folks here are opting for five-star raves. Well, I was as excited to visit Black Box's little experiment as anyone. And, all told, I would recommend that anyone who thinks it sounds like fun ought to look into it. But at the same time, I can't pretend that this neat idea doesn't have a troubled execution.\n\nTo get in you've got to meet up with an informant a few blocks away, who gives you directions after you give him the password, provided to you ahead of time. Sounds fun, right? A great way to get everyone in the spirit of things. We were told to show up at the prescribed spot at \"exactly\" ten till the hour and to wait until the coast was clear before approaching. I assumed this was to prevent a line from forming and spoiling the illusion. Well, apparently it didn't work because there was a huge, milling crowd of people very obviously dressed for the show. It took quite a while before the tipster was available, and when I gamely played along and gave him the password he snapped at us, telling us he was busy and would take care of us shortly. So now I felt like an asshole, and the fun atmosphere of the gimmick was spoiled a bit. \n\nWe ended up waiting around until everyone else had gone (I certainly wasn't going to bother him again, and even if I had what would I say? I'd have felt like a dick giving him the password a second time). Matter of fact, our assigned informant never did get back to us, and eventually one of the other guys noticed we'd been left hanging and took pity on us. He helped us out, but to be honest he was rather terse and snippy too. I couldn't tell if these guys were playing some kind of role or if they were just genuinely short-tempered, but it was an uncomfortable way to start the evening.\n\nThe clock shop thing is a nice setup and the interior of the place looks pretty good. I'd love to just hang around the set for a while if I had the opportunity. But right away we ran into another problem: They're very particular that you try not to talk or disrupt the show as it goes on, which makes sense. But there aren't nearly enough seats in the bar to accommodate all the of the actors and the audience, and if you're not lucky enough to snag one you're left just kind of hanging out awkwardly around the perimeter. No matter where you go you're bound to be in somebody's way. And here's the thing: There was no one we could ask where to go or what to do. We didn't dare talk to the actors and the few non-performer staffers were pretty busy.\n\nAt times I would want to move around to follow certain characters, but there was simply no space. There are several  rooms behind the bar that audience members are free to explore, but it's not immediately obvious where you're allowed to go and no way to tell who you're allowed to ask. For the record, the cast members and staffers were all very polite on the rare occasions they did acknowledge us. Only the guys outside were jerks. But if the audience can't have carte blanche to get in on the action then maybe it's best to assign them to their own designated section. That's how the backroom cabaret works, and it's noticeably more comfortable both for the audience and the performers.\n\nNow, there's plenty of fun to be hard here too. It's hard to talk about the good stuff because that would mean spoiling the nuances, but I echo my previous statement that anyone who likes the sound of it should certainly explore it while it lasts. But I also feel obligated to point out that, while I considered going a second time to catch a few things I missed last night, the cagey attitude that hangs over the whole things will probably keep me away.", "author": "Tam Lin J."}

They also don't interact with the audience.\n- I hope this doesn't happen to you but, while we're watching the performers, which we paid for, there was a woman who was practicing all the dance moves right next to us.

Tip: Rehearse your performance on your OWN time, not in front of the patrons.\n- They have a selection of proprietary drinks but you can't read the menus in the dark.  The servers do their best to try and explain but its all very inefficient.\n- The production just gets weird when the abandoned \"wife\" wanders around looking for her husband and daughter.  That was creepy.\n- After the \"show\", they move everyone to the \"casino\" where it gets hot very quickly.  The dealers have stilted personalities and have to take off their shoes to count to 20.\n- As we were leaving, I had to make a point of asking to see my drink tab.  I don't know about you but it makes me uncomfortable that a place just takes a credit card swipe and expects you to walk out and be surprised.  It was $23.50 for two cocktails (including the tip) so that wasn't bad.\n\nBottom line, we would not recommend nor repeat.

I saw it more as a commentary on the time period filled with bigotry, prohibition, and sexual repression.  \n\nCharacters were fascinating and setting was well-done. We got the after hours pass which was really cool and had the opportunity to chat with the cast and learn more about the entire piece. \n\nWELL DONE BOXCAR!", "author": "Julie D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-04", "description": "I should preface this review by saying I am a big fan of Punchdrunk Productions (one of the top innovators in immersive theaters) and as such have been to Sleep No More in NYC & Drowned Man in London several times.  I tried to not let my previous experiences with immersive theater influence my time at The Speakeasy but it was hard to do. That said my list below pretty much sums up my visit to Joe's Clock Shop.\n\nPros:\n~Incredibly talented performers. \n~Gorgeous set design. The set designers and decorators did a fantastic job especially for the small space they had to work with.\n~Voyeuristic area to watch all the happenings in the dressing room. Boxcar Theater should create more things like this room in Speakeasy as it really allows the audience to have insight into the lives and psychology of the characters.\n~Great concept for an immersive theater experience but needed to be more fleshed out.\n~Dedication to keeping the theme of a secretive speakeasy. I loved meeting in one location and having to find the second secret location. \n~Encouraging audience to dress in 1920's garb. It made the whole atmosphere so much more fun and authentic\n\nCons:\n~Soundscape & design not fluid or fully conceived \n~It was hard to follow characters around as each one's storyline was stilted and not continuous. There was a huge reliance on the stage performances in the bar as opposed to character/story development.\n~While the actors would interact with audience members, it was fairly jarring the way it happens and in some instances it seemed like the actor dropped character and was just chatting casually with me. I prefer Punchdrunk's method when it comes to 1 on 1 experiences, they're much more intense and intimate.\n~Racist character. Seriously why? He doesn't add to the story and he also doesn't receive the social justice someone like that should if one were to make an example of him. We all know the 20's were racist, but we don't need that in our face.\n~Over arching theme needs more fleshing out. There was too much reliance on the singing & dancing so the overall story got lost or put to the side.\n~It was hard to tell who was a performer vs. who was an audience member since everyone was dressed up.\n~The rules were not heavily enforced so there were times when audience members were having loud conversations with each other. That really took me out of the experience.\n\nSummary: all in all I'm really glad I went. I had a lot of fun and so did my friend. Since it's Boxcar Theater's first attempt at large scale immersive theater I think they did a fantastic job. Even though I think there are things that could be improved upon, I think it's a great start at bringing immersive theater to SF and I hope Boxcar does more productions like this in the future. However what ultimately went into my rating was deciding whether or not I'd return for more visits like I love doing for Punchdrunk shows.  While I enjoyed my time at the Speakeasy, I probably won't return for anymore visits.", "author": "Monica C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-20", "description": "Amazing! You are transported into the 1930's with amazing realness. You meet someone in a \"neutral:\" location and get directions. When you get there there's no one to help you find the door, and you seem to walk in on the shop keeper who looks hostile and wont assist you, so pay attention.\nOnce inside it feels very much like a speakeasy from the 30's. Actors sitting around you come alive and begin telling their story; the tapestry works so well.\nShow up in as close to period dress as you can to keep the ambiance. \nThe staff is friendly and helpful, the actors dedicated and the environment is a total immersion in a speakeasy of the period. Very well done!!", "author": "Gregory S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "An amazing night out. \n\nThe best thing I've seen in San Francisco, by far. \n\nBe aware this is an intense theatrical experience.  You are immersed in a theatrical event.  Some of the things you see are fun, funny.  Showgirls, drunk customers, gamblers, a slick magician that is fired for being late and drunk.  Other moments are hard to describe.  A shell shocked veteran from WWI that sees his fallen comrades walking by in gas masks.  A woman that finds her husband has gambled away the mortgage payment on their farm. It's heart wrenching.  \n\nIt feels like you are in the middle of a movie or play, observing from the inside.  \n\nYou get a text the day before telling you where to go. You will see others waiting around dressed up like it's 1920, so you don't feel so awkward.  Then you have a password to give.  They give you instructions on where to walk.  \n\nThey don't send everyone at once, so you're forced to figure out how to get in.  You find a dusty old clock shop and find your way in, a secret knock gets you through the door.  \n\nIn you walk into the most elaborate set.  It's 1923.  You walk into a speakeasy bar, with copper ceilings, a piano player, a casino, a vaudeville stage.  God knows how much this all cost.  \n\nBecause people come in costume, sometimes it's hard to tell who's part of the cast and who's a visitor.  Scenes happen all around.  You will want to follow a few scenes from room to room.  \n\nThe evening flew by.  At the end, our group compared notes. There is far too much to see in one visit.  Must go back again.  \n\nI'm looking forward to bringing out of town visitors to this one.  I'm sure there is nothing like this anywhere in the country. \n\nAn amazing plus.  I did not see one cell phone.   No cell phones, no one texting.  There are clear instructions to hide your phone.  It would ruin the illusion of someone pulled out an iphone.  The audience, for once plays along completely.  \n\n\nTruly a must see.", "author": "David M."}

Accidentally cross-posted this also to Boxcar's yelp)\n\nSo much fun!!!\nI'd seen Hedwig twice (and loved it!) and when I heard about even the idea of 'Speakeasy', I knew I absolutely had to go.\nSo, even though the tickets are not cheap by any means, they are totally worth it!\nFrom the moment of meeting our 'contact' till the end (I won't give any spoilers), the whole night truly puts you in the time and spirit of the show.\nThe actors are totally top notch and my best advice to anyone going to the show is just follow the stories you really like. The fun (and kinda sad) part is, you won't get to see all the drama in one night. It's just not possible. Just find a couple of actors you resonate with and follow them around and get into their story. You won't be disappointed. Plus, being in (at least kinda) period wear will only help immerse you in the experience.\n'Mickey' - You were awesome. Period. Thanks for making me genuinely feel welcome.\n'Sarah' - You had the best story of all, and I loved every second of it. Follow your dream kiddo. If anyone can do it, you can!\n'Tommy' the roulettes dealer - You never missed a beat. I would have seen more of the show if you weren't so damn much fun to gamble with. And cute to boot!\nSeriously, if there's any tickets left, you should totally go do this. It's sooo SF, it's sooo well done and it's sooo awesome, I guarantee you you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Stephen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-09", "description": "My husband and I went last night and had a great adventure!  It started off a little slowly as quite a big group was gathered at the first location and it took some time to get the info on where to go next, (I wonder if some people arrived before their time) but we all arrived in plenty of time for the first \"act\".  The set was amazing.  Everything from the secret entrance, the bar, the 2 level cabaret, the casino, and the dressing room were really well done.  It felt very authentic.  You start the evening in either the bar or the caberet.  We were in the bar, and that was my favorite part of the evening.  All the storylines start in this first part and it is easy to follow.  After that it is a bit more challenging.  Other reviewers have suggested picking one storyline to follow, and I wish I had read that first.  It was hard to manuver around because the rooms are small and I kept feeling like a just missed something important.  Part of the problem was that their bathroom was out of order so we had to wait and be taken by groups 2 blocks down the road.  I think I missed 1/2 hour or more of the show -- and my reserved seating at the caberet.  I'm sure they will fix the bathroom problem ASAP though.  It was hard to tell when it was time to go to your reserved seating, so probably the best time to make a reservation is for the first part of the show.  After that, it really doesn't make too much difference.  The acting was great and the musical performances were fun.  We tried to enter the casino a few times, but were told it was closed.  I'm not sure if that was part of the bathroom problem or if it is only opened at the very end of the night.  So, we were a bit disappointed to miss the whole casino part, especially after buying chips.  But, we still had a great time.  I wish there was some way to find out what happened to all the stories/characters.  Be sure to dress in period outfits.  Only a few people didn't and they stood out.  Dress cooly -- it gets very warm in there, especially in the bar.  Sit in the cabaret near the door to the patio, if you are gettting too warm.  I hear it's ending soon due to the building being sold.  I hope they can find a new, bigger place to continue the show.", "author": "P S."}
