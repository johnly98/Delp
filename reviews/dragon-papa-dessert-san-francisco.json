Solid customer service which was definitely not expected in Chinatown and not at such a small hole-in-the-wall--I almost walked by the door! \n\nI got the matcha flavor but honestly could not taste the matcha? It's very messy to eat and tough to cut up/take bites out of because it's so fragile, but it's also melt-in-your-mouth. The inside is a potpourri of sesame, coconuts, and peanuts. It's an interesting texture that reminded me of silk worms, but it grew on me. Was it worth $11? Hard to say, because it is so labor-intensive to make. I do feel good about supporting the mom and pop business. \n\nI also was sold on ginger rock candy in a small bag for $4. Again, hard to measure value because I feel better about supporting these women than, say, a larger corporation like Trader Joe's where I usually eat my ginger candy. \n\nTLDR: pricey but unique, yummy (but with a texture that is not for everyone) flavor in a labor-intensive candy that are made in-house and not in many places around the country.", "author": "Lizzie S."}

According to the owner, there aren't many places that continue on the generation of making this kind of candy. Sadly, we came 30 minutes before closing time, so we didn't get to see him actually making it. This is family owned and from my understanding, the family has been making this candy for 5 generations now! The owner was great! I asked if he ever gets tired from making the candy, and jokingly, he says, \"That's why I don't need to go to 24!\" He kindly described the process and explained the different dragon beard candy flavors they had: Green tea, original, coffee, mango, and strawberry. I really appreciate the time he gave in explaining how each flavor will taste; especially if this is something new to your tastebuds. We ended up buying the half original and half green tea ($11). \n\nI remember the ones I've had in Canada being really sticky, hard to bite into, really powdery, and did not have much flavor to is. BUT Dragon Papa's (such a cute name btw!) was far from all of that! It was so easy to take a bite without making too much of a mess and the sweetness was perfect. You'll also get the perfect amount of crunch from the peanuts inside it. The flavor from this candy comes from the \"dragon's beard\" that's wrapped around the peanuts. Both original and green tea tasted exactly how it was described to us and was light and fluffy. BUT! The green tea flavor won my heart (and my stomach)! \n\nWarning: This candy could become your next addiction. \n\nOverall, this traditional Chinese candy is not only delightful but it is also fun to eat! You'll end up growing a dragon beard just after one bite.", "author": "Rachel C."}

If you're looking for a unique way of satisfying your sweet tooth, give this local dessert place a try!\n\nAccording to them, they were first based in Daly City but then moved to the heart of Chinatown as most of the locals here loved having Dragon Beard Candy. For a lot of the locals it reminded them of having this treat back in China, and it quickly became popular first among the locals and later tourists. \n\nI ordered the half and half box of the Mango & Original dragon beard candy for $11. I think looking at photos online, I definitely thought it was going to be a lot bigger, but each candy is about the size of my thumb.\n\nWhile I would say at $11 for 6 pieces of the dragon beard candy is kind of pricey, but knowing the process of how they make the candy justifies it somewhat, because it can take one person up to HOURS making the candy. Unlike most candy nowadays where you can manufactor it by machiene, they make the candy here using a similar technique to hand pulled noodles- only instead of noodles they use candy instead!\n\nI got the half and half Mango & Original Flavor. If you're used to more traditional 'American' sweets, this isn't going to be as sweet, but it has more of a subtle sweetness.\n\nThe mango taste was more pronounced than the original flavor, but both were good in their own rights. They're slightly sweet on the outside with a peanutty coconut inside. \n\nBeware though, this candy is super messy to eat with, because the outside sugar coccoon basically crumbles into the center of the peanuttyness. But it's still really good!\n\nI'd have to give Dragon Papa a 4. It's a cultural sweet that really can't be beat, and the only reason why I knocked off a star is because it's kinda pricey for the size of the candy.

A bit on the dryer, lighter, and more powdery side, this is great for those of you who like older Chinese style sweets, which are often not actually all that sweet!\n\nFor the rest of us, it makes for an interesting experience, but at $11 per box of eight, probably not one that you'll be hankering to repeat often.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Crazy steep hills of Chinatown aside, Dragon Papa itself is a small shop with your typical high top glass displays, and narrow aisle walkway.

This smallest business named, \"Dragon Papa Dessert\" serves the customers of all ages to taste their finest selections of this well known traditional Chinese candy, the \"dragon's beard candy!\" The atmosphere is very active and on-going as I welcomed there. The concept is much normal and simple while entering the smallest interior lot. There, you'll see a window where a chef prepares to make the dragon's bear candy daily; dough after dough.\n\nThe employees here are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a sensational service! No cons at all!\n\nSo, how does dragon's beard candy came from? This candy is made of these ingredients as follows: fine sugar, roasted peanuts, coconut, white sesame seeds, rice flour (it does have gluten) and additional additives. Once it got mixed altogether with the right recipes and preparations, it turned into a fluffy, cotton styled mini hard candy after 15 minutes of making.\n\nNow onto the treat! I ordered the original flavor of the dragon's beard candy pack (costs $10 as of 2017). As I ate it, that candy tasted devouring and sensational! I can feel the exterior fluffs of the candy until I can feel the combo core of peanuts, coconut and white sesame seeds. Very fresh and elegant for that Chinese snack! Amazing!\n\nParking at Dragon Papa Dessert can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Dragon Papa Dessert is the most tremendous and incredible local mini dessert shop that I've ever discovered right here in San Francisco's Chinatown! A well, worthy visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

We called them to make sure they weren't sold out and they said that they continuously make more since they sell so quickly! \n\nWe got Mochi and a box of Green Tea Dragon Beard Candy. While Derek (the shop owner) was warming up the Mochi, he was extremely friendly and told us how there are only three families in the US that still make Dragon Beard Candy - his in San Francisco, one in Irvine, and one in Boston. \n\nThe Mochi is warmed up and then tossed in sesame seeds. You MUST eat this warm (as Derek insisted we do); eating it any other way would be doing it injustice. While the Mochi is warm, it feels as if it's melting into your mouth but you can still feel the chewy texture of traditional Mochi. I really enjoy how light and subtle the flavors are. One box of Mochi is $5. \n\nThe Green Tea Dragon Beard Candy has a strong green tea taste and a more subtle peanut filling compared to the original. It also tastes less sweet, probably due to the natural bitterness of green tea. The original Dragon Beard Candy is deliciously delicate on the outside with a sweet and nutty filling of peanut, sesame, and coconut in the inside. Dragon Beard Candy dissolves in your mouth and becomes like that of a caramel texture as the sugar melts and sticks together, giving it a sticky and chewy texture. One box of Green Tea Dragon Beard Candy comes with four pieces of green tea and four pieces of original flavored candy for $11.\n\nThis is unfortunately a dying tradition in Chinese candy-making culture, so hurry up and go try it before it's gone forever (crying inside).", "author": "Sylvia L."}

I hear there's an Instagram craze over these hand-pulled candies, so my friend and I decided we'd stop by after getting boba at Steap. There was a line but they moved through it very quickly. The owner(?) was VERY charismatic and friendly, which I REALLY appreciated since I've gotten flak in Chinatown for being Asian and not speaking Mandarin (hey, I'm only half... and 4th generation at that). He explained how the candy is made and what it's supposed to taste like - hard and icy at first, and then soft and chewy. Very cool!\n\nWe got a pack of 8 (half mango and half original) - never had anything like it! The closest way I could describe it would be like cotton candy with a crunchy exterior, with a chewy nut caramel nougat interior. Be careful, though - when you bite into one, expect a puff of sugar in your face! Totally caught me by surprise.\n\nI'd recommend the original flavor - but I'd say the other flavors are be worth a try, if you reeeaaaaaallly like mango, or honeydew (or whatever other flavors they are offering at the time). I had the mango, which was alright, if not a little odd - the mango flavor was very slight, which was actually a plus for me since I didn't care for the mango + peanut combination. The original though? Yum! \n\nUltimately, it's not my kind of candy, but it is fun and definitely worth a try!", "author": "Larissa M."}

However I never had it until just last week. \n\nSo the wife and I decided to skip cooking one night to hit Hong Kong Hot Pot. On the way though I saw this tiny ass store with someone stretching the honey disc. I said \"Let's eat fast before this shop closes!\"  Which we did :)  they have several different types but since the shop was closing up, we just got the regular kind with peanuts, sesame, and another kind of nut powder. There might've been honey on the inside too. $10 for a small box. \n\nAs you can imagine, the excitement to eat this was so overwhelming. We walked to the BART station and the whole time I'm walking too fast for the wife, who asked me to slow the hell down. Ha! I said (in my mind) I'm gonna eat one of these at the station so you better keep up! Cash only. \n\nSo when we got to the station I opened the packaging and felt the light fine strings of stretched powdered honey strands. I took one bite and I was HOOKED. The combination was way too delicious! The dried honey strands just dissolved in your mouth and at the same time, you flight the flavors of the mixed nut powders.  \n\nlol and behold a week later after decimating half the box watching Netflix, Tessa B asked me if I took pics. I could've sworn my wife ate the rest but a las, she did not! So I took some pics of the packaging and the TWO remaining treats. While she probably forgot about them, I didn't remind her either and savored every little bite :)\n\nTime to make another excuse to hit Chinatown!", "author": "Bob K."}

Similar to what you get at the Night Market in Richmond, BC, however, this is a store dedicated to Dragon Beard. It is $$$ 'cause you're actually paying for a cultural novelty whereas in Vancouver it is very very common, especially in Richmond BC. We were in Chinatown walking around and I had off mentioned a week before to the bestie about Dragon Beard, therefore, instead of waiting until home we decided to split a small piece. I recently uploaded a pic of myself on my Facebook page of it since I am organizing my San Fran scrapbook at the moment and forgot about this gem. I bought a few pieces of Green Tea flavor to bring back to the hostel to share with the front desk reception as a way of saying thank you for helping us with the room that day. I had a long conversation with the lovely girl about Vancouver and how large of an Asian population we have and the desserts, therefore, bringing this back for her and the staff was a welcome.

It's made with a special sugar and is either spun or hand-pulled and then is wrapped around a mixture of peanuts, sesame seeds, and coconut.  Some people might compare it to cotton candy, but personally, I can't do that.  It doesn't really have that melting factor that cotton candy has when you put it in your mouth.  In fact, the texture is quite unique.  At room temperature, the sugar is chewy when you eat it.  But, when it's refrigerated, it's crumbly.  Which is my favorite?  Wow.  Tough question.  I liked both.  Also, it is definitely not as sweet as cotton candy, which for me, is a good thing.\n\nWhile the candy itself is delicate and delicious, the best part of this shop is the \"show\" that they put on.  The shop itself is small.  But, there is a window in the front in where passersby can watch Dragon Papa himself hand-pull the sugar.  It's a fascinating process.  Think of it like hand-pulling noodles, but even harder.  Sugar is definitely harder to pull (like taffy).  But, watching this man, pull these delicate shreds of sugar, is amazing.   So amazing that it is very common to see the sidewalk blocked because of all the people watching and taking pictures (this guy included).", "author": "Jamie J."}

I used to enjoy this lovely and fun sweet treat of rolled molasses, peanuts, sesame and coconut as a child. Several years ago while traveling in Xian, I stumbled upon an unassuming street vendor making these divine treats and went bananas (think Ratatouille moment when the food critic gets transported to being a child upon a taste of the delicious soup). It was a rare find even in China!\n\nI first found out about this shop located on Grant through Kiva of all things. The store owner was seeking crowdfunding help for his business and I immediately bookmarked this place, excited to try it. \n\nWhen I finally made my way over with a friend, I had a great experience. Right away your eyes are greeted by a window display where a girl's pulling and making fine strands of molasses, or white \"dragon beard.\" I loved how this craft is incorporated and highlighted, way cool to just watch! After stepping into the tiny shop, the owner welcomed us and asked if we've had the candy before, before warmly giving us an overview on what this candy is and how it's made and also running through the flavor varieties they carry. There is the traditional (more peanuty taste), green tea, strawberry and mango. A little something for every palate. I opted for a tray of traditional and one traditional/ green tea mix. $10 a tray is definitely a steeper price than how much they cost in China! But I had to get 'em. The taste is on-point. I love the traditional flavor and found the green tea flavor to be a bit medicinal (gotta stick to the original). It is aromatic and fragrant and the dragon beard isn't overly sweet but light and fun to eat. \n\nI recommend anyone curious to pop in and try out the dragon beard candy. It's a bit educational, cultural peek into this fast-fading candy making craft. But be careful, you might end up with a white beard yourself when you devour these babies!", "author": "Jing D."}

In a few seconds, the candy will be verrrrrry chewy! Think chewy peanut butter bar. While this whole procedure is happening, strings of sugar will be everywhere and stick onto your lips, so definitely save these to be eaten at home!

I can't make a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew, and cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two. Nope, that's not my thing, but my curiosity was piqued by the presence of this Chinatown shop although it's more accurate to call it a walk-in closet with a true candy man out front. He methodically makes something called Dragon's beard candy which I have never heard of before I started reading the reviews for this place (photo: http://bit.ly/1IbqUqR). It goes back two thousand years to the Han Dynasty when the imperial court chef needed to amuse the Emperor with something sweet.\n\nApparently he was the Donald Trump of the Far East. He probably wanted to build a wall, too, to keep the Keebler elves out. The intricate process here involves turning rice flour into small threads which are sweetened by sugar, coconut, sesame seeds and peanuts. It looked and felt like the kind of packing material you get when you order those Mexican beer bottle masks from eBay. Luckily, it tasted better than that, at least I'm presuming it did since I don't usually eat the packing material. With a highly unusual texture, it was more like a grainier version of cotton candy with a chopped peanut filling (photo: http://bit.ly/1JT0TnF).\n\nI liked it since it wasn't cloyingly sweet like other Chinese sweets, but it does cost an exorbitant $9 for a box of eight (photo: http://bit.ly/1JsUk4U). With a relatively quick shelf life, the value is questionable unless you have friends with low blood sugar. At least I impressed the waitress at Chef Hung who saw the box in my possession and simply said \"Expensive\". That's right, sister. They sell a few less expensive items like ginger candy and even mochi (although I didn't see it) but why. If you're coming to see the candy making show, then you must be here for the Dragon's beard. Pull it if you dare. They should sell half-orders if you ask me. Truly a novelty.\n\nCANDY - 4 stars...definitely unique and you certainly pay the price of that\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...walk-in closet\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...the young man at the counter certainly sells his product with zeal, the candy maker is very quiet\nTOTAL - 4 stars...pull that Dragon's beard if you dare", "author": "Ed U."}

The molasses-wrapped candy mirrors what I had as a kid in Hong Kong. Neatniks be warned: It's true that enjoying the stringy candy means developing messy \"dragon beard\" as the string hangs off of your chin and face. Moreover, your clothes will receive a magical sprinkling of the magic Dragon Papa powder. \n\nThat said, for my friend and me, the messiness actually made the process of trying the candies that much more fun! We tried the mango and original flavors, and I personally prefer the original; the taste of the mango seemed a bit artificial, whereas the original was as the candy was meant to taste. \n\nThe only reason Dragon Papa falls short of the full five stars is its price point.

Not only is it delicious, it is a part of Chinese culture and history which makes it just that much better. And to make things even better they actually perform the stretching of the candy in a display window at the front of the store, which attracts attention. Thus, adding that \"WOW!\" factor. \n\nThe candies are sold in a small little box filled with 8 pieces for $9, which is quite expensive in my eyes but totally worth it considering how much art goes into each and every one of them. So my best advice would be to savor each and everyone of them until tears draw from your eyes! In terms of taste it really hits the spot because the crushed peanuts aren't too sweet which is a good thing because the pulled candy threads are already sweet enough.   \n\nOverall, if you want to try some really delicious old-school Chinese candy then this is the place where it is at! These candies are a wonderful gift for friends and families that love sweets and peanuts.", "author": "Benson M."}

He flew happily as his long white silky beard trailed behind him. Often, strands of his beard would fall out and create light fluffy clouds. When a cloud would form the dragon would cry for joy. Sometimes those tears would touch the clouds and produce rain. Farmers' crops would grow and rivers would flow. The people living underneath the sky would be grateful. To celebrate their symbiotic relationship the people created Dragon Beard Candy. \n\n[THE STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION BY ME]\n\nThe candy is created by father and son. The lightly sweet, soft, and chewy candy is filled with peanuts. The combination of the chewy beard and the crunchy peanuts is perfect. I would more say it's a pastry than a candy.

It's a hot and new business on Yelp and was recently featured on the SF Chronicle (http://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/Chinatown-s-Dragon-Papa-turns-candy-making-into-6540529.php) This shop used to operate as a booth in the dim sum behemoth, Koi Palace, in Daly City and has since branched out to expand their reach.\n\nFOOD:  I've only tried their flagship dessert, the Dragon Beard Candy, but Dragon Papa does also offer Ginger Candy and Mochi. On the exterior, the Dragon Beard Candy looks like Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats (or a white cocoon or mini pillow) decorated with white wispy silk-like threads of sugar. This airy outer layer dissolves in your mouth like cotton candy. If you want a crunchier shell, apparently you can also refrigerate the candy. The core of the candy is filled with crushed peanut, coconut, and sesame seeds. Altogether, the combination of the melty exterior and crumbly interior gives the candy a chewy taste. \n\nSERVICE: The owner is really friendly and takes the time to introduce you to Dragon Beard Candy. We had a nice conversation about the history of the candy and his store. There isn't  much of a seating area in this shop, but that's the norm for some  dim sum shops/bakeries around the area.\n\nLOCATION: Dragon Papa is located on Grant Avenue, one of Chinatown's main and oldest streets. If you enter Chinatown from the Dragon's Gate and continue walking down that pathway you'll eventually come across this store. Also take sometime to enjoy the murals and sculptures of terra cotta warriors located right above the shops in this vicinity.\n\nPRICE: The Dragon Beard Candy is $9 for a box of 8 candies. While the cost may seem quite high, I think the pricing is appropriate considering that candy making is a laborious and dexterous process. Currently they only accept cash.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the pictures of the plated candy were taken off-site.", "author": "Anthony S."}

I was greeted by a gentleman who was super friendly. He explained to me that the candy was special . it was called dragon beard and consists of coconut, peanuts, and sesame seeds inside. The guy said I needed to be careful when I eat it jokingly. Today they only had the original flavor because it was so close to the new year. So I got me a box that ran about 9 bucks.

It looks so amazing almost like he was making cotton candy but very dusty .Since I was wearing black I was going to wait to try when I got home.

I will totally have to recommend anyone in the area give this place a try. I believe they are the only ones in the bay making it.", "author": "Tony B."}

I live in LA and there was an old man who made these in the LA Chinatown, but he has since retired. Thus, my mom and I were super excited to see this young asian guy making these from a small window in the SF Chinatown! Super unexpected! \n\nWhile some people think the box of dragon beard candy for $9 is expensive, it's pretty reasonable considering it is a recipe and craft passed down for generations. The young man is the owner and makes these candies as well as the mochi and ginger candy fresh each day. The old man is his dad and the one who trained him. \n\nAnyway, I really like to support small businesses run by families so I bought both the dragon beard candy and the mochi. Both were delicious!! The mochi was still warm and not covered in sugar like in other places. The dragon beard candy reminds me of the kind I would eat in Hong Kong when I was little and it just melts in your mouth! \n\nI would highly recommend that you try this place out!! It's a small hole in the wall, but it's really clean inside. They do accept credit card and not just cash only. Hurry and go grab a box!", "author": "Michelle C."}

I love this candy since I was a child in China.  I had it in USA only three times in 40 years.  I am just way too happy to find this shop.  I was so excited and I couldn't stop telling anyone who would listen that how good this candy is.  I especially like that it's handmade.  Lots of work and talent put into it.  You got to try this candy.  However, if you are one of those people that is allergic\u200b to peanuts, then this is not for you.  Please, you must go and try it.  I will definitely go back again to get more.\n\n****\nI'd like to reply to M.C.'s negative review below. I do not agree with his review.  I certainly do not think this father and son deserve such negative review.  It's obviously M.C. doesn't know anything about making this type candy.  it certainly requires more than 10, 15 minutes.  To me, the price is worth it.  It's handmade, not like your everyday commercial candy filled with all kinds of the chemical.  \n\nI am a big believer in support small mom and pop shop and hard working people.\n\nBy the way, I do not know the shop owners.

Overall reviews were good then again I need to see and taste it for myself before I come to my own conclusion. So, I went ahead and purchased one pack of \"Dragon Beard\" candy and brought it home. The texture and taste itself isn't something new to me because I've had something similar in the past (dimsum). Of course that is where the similarity ends. It's really fluffy, very delicate to the touch sort of like touching raw silk before it's been made into something else. Ultra flaky, crunchy and depending on the temperature when you try it it's something to try. Looking at the two and three star review... It's obvious they're too critical on the candy. Yes, it's not fancy and yes it does cost a bit considering that it's only desert but so is a lot of things in san Francisco. Have those people ever tried small boutique shop. Try throwing out $20 for a few piece of chocolate or $5 buck cupcake or dropping by \"Off the Grid\"  for over price small portion snack.

I love the texture and the flavor, which taste \"peanutbuttery\".  I read on a posting that it was like an Abazaba, very similar in taste, but not as chewy.  They only had one flavor when we went, but I guess they have strawberry and coffee flavors as well. \nYou can see the guy making it and it was an experience that I have not witnessed before.\nNext time I am in SF will come back to try again.", "author": "AJ R."}

I understand the rent and wage are high in sf, but $9 per box for the drgon beard candy is little too much. I still recommend ppl go get it and try it. Maybe they should do some discount for ppl who buy more than 2 or 3 boxes.", "author": "B B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-23", "description": "The bearded candy is really nutty and sweet, it feels like peanut butter. It starts out as a cool stringy candy and then it condenses in your mouth. Ultimately ends up tasting like a chick o stick or a peanut butter bar in your mouth.  It is a bit expensive for a little candy but I'm certain this is fair given the amount of labor.must try", "author": "Lewis B."}

The owner of the place is super duper nice. The texture is super unique and the peanut fillings, Mmmm. It is a bit on the pricey side for such a small package.

I had these when I was visiting Hong Kong, and these were just as good.  They're a bit pricey ($9 for 8 pieces).  I would come back when I visit Chinatown, which isn't too frequent, thankfully.  The lady said you can fridge the Dragon Beard for up to 3 months to preserve the freshness.  I didn't believe her at first, but I gave it a try since I wanted to share with my family.  Indeed it still tasted fresh after a week in the fridge!", "author": "Icy H."}

The peanut and sesame are so fine and smooth and that's I did not try in another dessert places in the Bay Area. The Mochi is warm and soft but not too sweet.

We had to admit both were better than we expected, the beard candy and ginger rock were sweet but not too overpowering, very addictive!

I had a dessert in Thailand that looked strange, but was actually yummy, & I thought this would be similar. When I ate 1 of the rolls, my 1st thought was \"is this a food product\"? The outer floss stuff is a bit weird. Not very sweet or tasty at all. I enjoyed the peanut/coconut filling, but it's chopped so fine that it gets stuck all up in the crevices of my teeth. I also bought the mochi that was warm & rolled in the same peanut stuff, that was yummy, but same problem w/the filling getting stuck in between my teeth. All-in-all, although pricey, but I don't regret buying it. The young man who was probably the son was very pleasant, it's a small business, & it was interesting to try. Support the local small businesses, right? Oh, BTW, the rolls when chilled have a little crunch to them which is a little more interesting compared to not chilled.", "author": "susan w."}
