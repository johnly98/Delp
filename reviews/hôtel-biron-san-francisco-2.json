It's dark & cavern-like. It's casual but sexy. It feels very European, in that effortlessly cool kind of way. A true hidden gem. \n\nYou order everything at the bar (hence, the frazzled bartender). The wine list is divided by region, repping US, France, Italy, Germany, South America, Spain, New Zealand, etc. Over 20 wines offered by the glass, but bottles are definitely a better deal. I did the math: bottle price is 3x the glass price, and you definitely get at least 5 glasses in a bottle! After all, this is the kind of place you want to stay and lounge for a while, so bottles make sense. \n\nFood is simple: build your own cheese & charcuterie plates. What more do you need? Nothing really. \n\nThe right spot for a laid back nightcap, pre-dinner drinks, or simple catch-up date with friends.

Only tell your cool friends okay.\n\nAfter a tough week... wait, who am I kidding? After any day, a glass of wine to kickstart your tastebuds, or fire up your nose with splendid aromas of berry, oak and spice is always a welcome reward. Dimly lit, H\u00f4tel Biron forces you to use your inside voice as you leave the hustle of life at the threshold. It is not a place for your entire office, or gang of friends.  So join a pal and leave the 'group' behind. The tables are for two and four, nothing more. \n\nThere's no table service (sigh) so you'll need to get up and place your next order. Credit cards and cash are accepted forms of payment. The menu offers a varied range of American, French and Argentinean wines. They may have Italian as well. Though I can't recall. I was with my Argentinean friend so we focused on the other three. Champagne of course is also served. \n\nIf I could make one request, I would like more single glass options. My friend wanted to try a glass of the St. \u00c9milion, which unfortunately was only by the bottle ($55). Aside from that, it is a very nice wine bar.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-26", "description": "H\u00f4tel Biron reminds me of a cozy European wine bar in the countryside that you stumble upon on a rainy bike ride. Subterranean and cozy, it's surprising how quick the place filled up over the course of a weeknight. \n\nThere are bar stools, small tables and two large broken-in couches crammed into the space. If possible, the best place to drink would be the 4 seats by the bar. The bartenders know their stuff, and can recommend any wine based on your mood. Not surprisingly, on the night we visited, 2 of the 4 spots were occupied by a wine sales person with a cooler of opened wine -- every wine lover's eye-popping experience. \n\nOne caveat is that all orders have to be made at the bar. Ordering becomes quite cumbersome as the place fills up and one has to navigate bodies to get to your next order. \n\nThat being said, the cheese plate! What a cheese plate! The wine list is definitely well-researched, as it's the first wine bar in North America I've found to carry a sparking Gruener Veltliner.", "author": "Sharon F."}

I can't really remember all the places we visited in this beautiful city.\n\nAnyway, we found Hotel Biron because Frank M had seen it on TV somewhere or heard it on a podcast he listens to.  We make the trip here using the muni.  It's actually pretty easy to get to if you know where it is.  It was kind of last at night when we made our way over here.  And it seems like it's in a shady part of town.  (Although, it probably wasn't)  It's just that everything around it was closed.   And the name is kind of misleading I think.  We were looking for some big hotel.  But the entrance was actually at the back of a low traffic street.  I don't even think there were any signs for this place.\n\nAnyway, we found it fine.  Inside of the bar was nice.  I think it was a bar.  There weren't too many people in here.  They told us to sit wherever we wanted so we chose the spot at the way back.  The couches there were the kind where you just sink into it and fall asleep.   Although... reading the reviews now from other yelpers, I'm thinking we shouldn't have sat there.

Umm...we just came back from a wine tasting event..I'm sure not all reds tasted like that.  So he goes to pour me that wine instead of offering a tasting of anything else.  - 1 star for that.\n\nThe 2nd big star minus is the music.

The prices are on par with most of the other wine bars I've visited in SF.  I went with two other friends and we each had a glass of wine and then we shared a plate of cheese and pate served with a baguette.  Even with a 20% tip, the total only came to $18/person and the cheese/pate serving was a large portion.\n\nIt's not a large place and it was busy when we got there around 9PM on a Thursday, but the three of us were able to snag a table in the very back and there were a few scattered tables for two available.\n\nI'm so glad I discovered this little gem of a place and am already planning another trip!", "author": "Kimberly B."}

But if you take a few steps past Platform 9 3/4, the sign magically appears and you are whisked into a long and narrow bar full of exposed brick, 2 seaters, candles, and retired warlocks.\n\nThe bar itself is really small and only has 3 stools in front of it. But wedge your way in and order your drink of choice. As an avid dry white winer drinker, I made myself order a red wine. I had my friend pick a \"gateway red\" out for me. I settled on an Argentine Pinot Noir and really liked it. Still not my go-to, I feel a little better about the Red Community. \n\nThey have a few larger tables, but they were all taken by the time I got there so I called dibs on the couch in the back room. The only other thing back there is a small table and the 2 people sitting there were on a first date. I felt a little uncomfortable the first 20 minutes as I was waiting for my friends to arrive and listening to their answers about jobs and where they live, but it helped assert that first date awkward conversations seems to be universal. \n\nThe next time you're here, keep a look out for the regulars.

Huge hunks of thick cut cheese from all over the world and half a loaf of sliced baguette.  A $6 plate plus a $2 quince paste or almond side can substitute for dinner.\n\n* The place is comfortable and completely unpretentious.

They were back there for some time; hands exploring, loins burning and erupting in passion and lust, tongues and lips locked in a heated embrace.  Hahaha...  There is also a small menu, I believe, although we had just eaten at Zuni, so we didn't partake.  \n\nThe atmosphere is my favorite part of this experience.  I really enjoy art, especially when I am buzzed and can make up funny shit about the artists' state of mind during the painting.

The wine list is extensive and has something for everyone. Prices are a bit high, but I hear the owner is willing to pour a variety of tasters if you ask. Had a nice cava rose for $13/glass.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-27", "description": "Many, many years ago when I was in Paris with a girlfriend, one night we met these two guys. I was translating bits and pieces of my friend's quickly blossoming vacation romance (the only language they had in common was the language of love), as well as managing my own new 'friendship' and having to think quickly enough to say in French, \"I don't CARE if your apartment is just around the corner. I don't WANT to come to your place to take a bath.\" I am so not French. But hey...things can change, actually. ;)\n\nAnyway, on another night they took us to this bar called \" le Caveau du ...something\" as I recall. It wasn't in the guidebooks. It had no sign. It only had a guy sitting on a stool at the entryway, with whom one of our friends exchanged a few words. \n\nAnd then we descended a set of old, narrow, concrete stairs into the bar. The room was actually a sealed off intersection of two drainage pipes in the old Parisian sewer system. It was darkly lit. The sound was not echo-y, but a little muffled, so voices didn't carry. There were nooks & crannies. There was hip, but mellow music playing. The whole place was just sort of clandestine & oh so sexy...\n\nI tell this story just to offer a point of reference. I was hoping to find a similar sort of vibe at Hotel Biron. But needless to say, I was a little disappointed. It's not that it's a bad place, but based on others' reviews, my expectations were a little out of whack. \n\nIt has potential, definitely. I liked the little room in the back, the selection of wines is huge, but I was shocked to see a Chilean Santa Rita wine for $8/glass. That's about what half a bottle of pretty decent chilean wine costs. The bartender was quick with recommendations & definitely knew her stuff. \n\nIt was packed and loud, and the music was this metallic screeching that actually seemed to amplify the din of the crowd (I could hear 2 other tables' conversations besides our own), and I found it annoying. I would have liked to have heard some Massive Attack or something...just something smoother or darker. And maybe some fabric on the walls or ceiling to soften the acoustics?

The wine selections haven't rotated as frequently, and the crowd has become a bit too boisterous for my tastes.

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the wine list is interesting and not expensive. If you can, it makes sense to buy by the bottle as for the most part bottle prices are only 3 times that of the glass prices when offered. A brief food menu including cheeses, seasonal fruits, charcuterie, and olives is designed to complement the wines.\n\n\nI arrived a bit earlier than my friend and luckily was able to snag a table near the bar area, and ordered a glass of 2006 Sur \"de los Andes\" Torrontes. It was light and refreshing, but lacked a fruity quality that I had hoped it would have. Once my friend arrived we tasted a few red varietals, and decided to go with a bottle of Jenke Vineyards Shiraz from the Barossa Valley. It needed to breathe just a bit, but notes of berries and a strong earthy quality made it really delicious and interesting. We also tried a couple of the cheeses. Old Quebec, a Canadian raw cow's milk cheddar aged for 3 years was rich and creamy, and Serra da Estrela, a Portugese washed rind raw sheep's milk cheese, was also decadent and delicious.

Given the easy location, the late-night hours, and the romantic atmosphere, I thought it would be the perfect place to share a bottle of wine.\n\nI was treating, so I ordered a bottle of Malbec from Argentina and we brought it to our table.  When my husband tried the wine, he noted that it tasted very acidic and seemed to be past the \"good drinking point.\"  Although my palette is not as refined as his for wines, when I tasted it I had to agree that it did not quite taste right, a bit on the sour side.\n\nMy husband approached the bar and let the bartender (or wine steward, or whatever he calls himself) know that the wine was not good, suggesting \"try it and you'll see.\"  The bartender smelled the wine and said, \"It's a Malbec.\"  My husband responded, \"I'm from Argentina, I know what Malbec is supposed to taste like.\"  \n\nAt that point the bartender turned around abruptly, opened the cash register, took out the amount corresponding to what the bottle of wine had cost, and shoved it into my hand, sneering at us indignantly, \"You're done!!\"\n\nI have never experienced anything even remotely like this in any restaurant or bar.  Any decent establishment would have offered an alternative wine, or at the VERY least, an apology to customers who were not satisfied with the quality of what they had ordered.  Instead, the staff treated us as if we were some kind of low-life scum and kicked us out of the bar.  And the most astonishingly insulting part of it was that I had to ask the guy to give me back the gratuity that I had left him.....apparently he was planning to keep his 20% after insulting us, kicking us out, and basically ruining our special and romantic evening??!!\n\nI know Hotel Biron looks charming and all, but in fact it is the snottiest, rudest, most pretentious place I've ever been.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-08", "description": "I'm writing this review after having been to Hotel Biron a number of times.  Every time my experience has been nothing short of 5 stars.  \n\nThe wine list has a good selection and because I ask for help/tips (unlike some other reviewers below, apparently) I always end up with something delicious.  Because I like to jump around on the list quite a bit and because I tend to go alone, I usually get wine by the glass; recently I noticed that prices range from $9 to $14--clearly this will depend on what the current offerings are when you visit.  And, again, with a list so large and diverse, I would be shocked if you didn't find something you liked (and I would kindly suggest you stick to drinking home alone).\n\nThe bottled beer list (from $3 to $10) is also great; the selection isn't as huge, but it is appropriately diverse and offers something for everyone when you aren't in the mood for wine.  Biron also offers sake and non-alcoholic drink options.\n\nThe bar area, while small at three or four seats, leads to fantastic conversation with the staff and other customers.  I tend to go alone and I am fine with talking or not talking (I could talk or not talk all day); Biron's staff and customers have always been accommodating to my mood or adjusted it for the better.  The seating area is not too huge either, but I've never seen a group or couple unable to manage when they arrive.  When you come in, stop at the bar and get a menu and order at the bar.  The artwork changes occasionally, and along with the music, adds to the mellow atmosphere.\n\nThe tasting plates--cheese, meats, fruits, nuts, etc.--are a great way to enhance the experience.  $6 each per cheese or meat selection, and $3 for side--includes plenty of slices baguette, or crackers if you choose.  Don't know what to get?  Crazy thought....ask.  \n\nBottom line--good wine, beer, and tasting plates.  I'm always discovering something new, whether it be a friend, food, or drink.

The max capacity at this place is probably about 40 people. The decor is exposed brick combined with an assortment of small couches, small tables, and chairs. There is one very small bar in the middle of the place and the service mantra seems to be \"come and see us at the bar once you know what you want.\" The bartenders are exceptionally helpful, though, and they can recommend a drink to fit your price range and budget. The wine list includes a good mix of domestic, old world, and new world wines by the glass.\r\n\r\nAside from a very pleasant atmosphere (which is a function of the fact that the place really only has seating for about 40-50 people), Hotel Biron has one of the best beer selections in all of San Francisco. They consistently have hard-to-find European beers that you can't find anyplace else. One of my pet peeves is when a bartender serves a fine European beer in the wrong type of glassware -- the bartenders at Biron are smart enough to know better.\r\n\r\nThis is a great place to share a bottle of wine in a couples setting, to end a first date, or to get to know someone better over a drink a pleasant atmosphere. It is really hard to find this place if you don't know where it is. It is also not in the best neighborhood. Don't let either of those things stop you from checking it out.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you like Belgian beer, try to get your hands on a bottle of Scaldis.

Why? \n\nWell, Hotel Biron is one of those semi-hidden gems of a city, the type you reference now and again (ok, more now, than again, in casual conversation, constantly), and never go to enough - would every night be enough?  But when friends are in town, this fine place is always high on the list of places to attend to - especially on a week day, as other yelpers have said.  On the weekends it *can* be more crowded, but it's not a guarantee.  I've been there on a Saturday night, sat down with mi amiga and had ourselves some wine, some cheese and some pear, no crowd and no sweat.  And it is always lovely.. \n\nThe exposed brick and low-lighting of Hotel Biron is the backdrop for a constantly rotating art exhibit of, I believe, paintings by local artists.  The friendly barkeeps and kitchen staff are the source for a on-point wine recommendations (if you wish), simple conversation (if you wish), or a board or cheese and fruit (also, if you wish).  I usually wish two out of the three; my wishes are also, constantly rotating. \n\nIn short, I highly recommend.  Find the \"B\" sign in the alley behind the Zuni Cafe and you know you've arrived for a night (or maybe just part of the night - a start or end?) of good wine, some nibbles, and a chance to share a few secrets with your comrades, old or new..\n\nBy the way, if you or your co-conspirator are not into wine, there is a short, but very good beer list here as well: Celebrator and more!", "author": "Eric H."}

I loved how moody and European it felt - I have a major crush on exposed brick walls and this place had them in spades.  The fact that I can drink wine to my heart's content was a definite bonus.  Little nooks and secluded corners for more romantic encounters, and larger tables and more open areas for chatting with others.  I was smitten and vowed to become a regular.\nFast forward to ages later when I finally made it back in.  It's now for a late spring happy hour and I've gotta say, I was nowhere near as twitterpated as I was on my first visit.  Maybe it's the daylight.  Maybe they covered up some of the brick with plaster, and the plaster was all chippy and nicked.  Maybe the new seating isn't as comfy as the couches I seem to remember.  Maybe it was the weird smell or the fact that I didn't love my wine.  I can't be sure but whatever it was, it knocked a star off my initial impression.\nI still have a soft spot for the space and I tend to love the artwork they have on display, so I'll definitely be back - I think I'll just wait until it's dark enough to gloss over some of the flaws and put me in a more forgiving mood.

Sure there are some drawbacks - a corked wine from time to time, the art exhibition that seems more trash than class, the overbearing din when the place is packed. But it all seems to hang together. But there is something of a celebration of wine about the place, coupled with the enthusiasm for wine that you sense from the staff. The wine list is just superb. An exhibition that states \"bacchus drowns more than neptune\" didn't take me where I expected - the bassins of Versailles. With that I have added a shot of the \"bassin de bacchus\" - which indicates the spirit of this lovely little wine bar.", "author": "Vera N."}

As a child of the 80's, I'm a sucker for exposed brick and as a resident of San Francisco, a lover of the readily available parking space. And as a blatant snob who loathes this trait in others, the staff is friendly and funny, having no problem with our ordering $30 bottles of wine and taking up a leather couch for the sole purpose of batting our eyelashes at anyone remotely attractive in candlelight. \nIn closing, I have always, always, always had a great experience at Biron and will most likely be found here at midnight on Friday...", "author": "Beth S."}

I ordered a Riesling and it was only so so for $10 - the cheese plate was better deal at $5. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I was shortchanged by $5 - either that or I left a $5 tip (instead of $1) for my glass of wine. I'm not exactly cheap but I never intentionally tip that high on a drink unless it's called a Blow Job because it comes with an actual blow job.

It definately has a hole in the wall quality to it but it is this same quality that can also make it attractive to many people. The exposed red brick is nice looking but as others have mentioned the chairs are not the most comfortable. The cheese portions there are very generous and unlike most places where you get 4 tiny pieces of bread to serve up 4-5 ounces of cheese Hotel Biron delivers. There is a strange smell that permeates the place as others have noted but this is new within the last year. I have not been back to Biron for more than a drop in since their neighbor had a fire last year and we were all forced to leave which was ok because as much as i want to like Biron it is too loud and uncomfortable to have a conversation with somebody.", "author": "Jamie b."}

Sometimes, the people are too pretentious for others, sometimes to hipster, sometimes too old, sometimes too young.  I gotta tell you, I go to Hotel Biron, have some good wine and cheese with my lady, and I really don't give a goshdarn too much about the people around me. I quit caring about the other cliques after high school.  Actually, I'm lying.  I didn't care then either.\n\nListen, I don't know anything about crowds and all that.  Here's what I know about: wine. They do a good job.  It's not the best, (think Hayes and Vine from a couple years back), but they do very well.  First Crush has some great flights and small plates, and I like that, but the decor and variety in Biron's wine list is better.  Hotel Biron does a great job of finding eclectic wines from all over the world.  Well, most of the world.  I'm still waiting for a wine list with some Middle Eastern varietals to shake things up.  Some of these places go a little too safe.  Hotel Biron has some good cheese plates, with ample portions for a more than fair price.  Go, drink wine, eat cheese, enjoy the decor, and quit caring about who else is in there with you.  Unless, of course, you're into that sort of thing.", "author": "James P."}

I cant believe all the good yelp reviews on this place.  It is literally so sad.  From first glance it seems like it is going to be a cute little wine bar, tucked away in an alley off market street. But it is actually an old run down hole in the wall, that put up some really cheap crappy decor and then dimmed the lights.\nAll the table are super sticky and wobble, its stuffy with poor ventilation, the floor is caked with dirt.  I am not even sure what the floor was actually, I felt like I was walking through a construction site, with all the uneven surfaces they have going on there. Oh and the one bathroom lock doesnt work, and people kept walking in on each other, and when you open the door up on someone, everyone in the back room can see you sitting on the toilet as they sip their wine.\n\nFelt like I was at a marina wine bar....  I would say almost every one around me was drinking rose and white wine.....so like i said......little wine knowledge going on...because if there were...reason I am giving it one star.....half the wine they had sitting back behind the bar,  that they were serving had gone bad, and no one seemed to know any better.\nSo whatever, I throw up my hands.  I seriously think that you can open up a wine bar in this city and serve grocery store wine from another country, charge 15 dollars a glass, and no one would even know any better.\nI dont know, maybe the 4 bad wines I tried was just a fluke....", "author": "Allie M."}

The crowd was hip and cute, fun people enjoying the wines and having a good time.  They do art exhibits and I was there when they had a very interesting display of a local group that specialized in kinetic art and regular art. The kinetic art was hypnotizing (something about blood platelets running through the veins, but I couldn't stop watching it).  The menu is sparse, but quality.  Cheeses, salami and olives all served with bread.  Finally, there's the wine list, which for the most part is very Euro-centric, but very good and quite reasonably priced.
