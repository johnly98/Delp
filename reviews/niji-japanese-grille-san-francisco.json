Too bad the location isn't that great.  It's tucked all the way at the end of the top floor and competing with other restaurants during peak hours.  The good thing is that they offer basic Japanese food if you want to fix that craving you have of yours - because that is exactly what I did.\n\nI went here to get my udon fix and they offer sushi.  I was really craving for udon during lunch and yelped where in my vicinity would have it.  This restaurant popped up on top when I searched for udon!  \n\nSo I went here and ordered udon, of course.  Simple presentation.  Thinner than usual on the udon texture, a bit on the salty side for their soup and too sweet with their yellow melons that they provide in their udon bowl.  My suggestion is to cancel that sweetness of those sliced up yellow melons by sprinkling Japanese chili powder on top of everything and sipping on some of that hot soup.  \n\nGood service, but the cafe lacks ambiance and Japanese decor.  Their food quality lacks a Japanese cute (kawaii) style to it as well.\n\nI wouldn't be back unless I am really craving for udon again!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Niji is a little place in Crocker Galleria, where many other restaurants tout their fast casual cuisine. Not a fancy or trendy restaurant, as it seems to be built to optimize the lunch-time rush. Everything was served on paper plates, and even the soup came in plastic bowls. Not very eco-friendly.\n\nI ordered the tempura combination, which comes with soup, salad, and rice. All the food came out within 5 minutes. I always love Japanese-style salad dressing, so I enjoyed the salad. Miso soup was good, though it'd be pretty hard to mess up miso soup. The portion size was large: there were three pieces of shrimp tempura and then tons of vegetables (zucchini, broccoli, etc). The food was decent.\n\nI feel a little bad giving 3-stars as that's based off comparing Niji with most normal Japanese places. It's certainly not up there in terms of quality.

My favorite place in SF for Japanese style noodles is Katana-Ya. My friend goes here often and can vouch for it. I'm a little taken back when she says she has never been to Katana-Ya. \n\nSo I walk up to the counter and say \"Ramen with tempura please.\" They don't serve ramen! I pick my expectations up from the floor and just say \"I'll have what she is having.\" So I guess Udon w/ tempura will have to do. \n\nThe wait is about 5 mins and I'm anxiously waiting for the soft pillowey noodles, the light/salty broth, the crips deep fried veggie goodness. What comes out is a huge bowl and a side plate of vege-tastic tempura bits. I'm running late so I eat very quickly. The bowl is huge, but the noodles are thin. They were good but not as chewy and soft as I would like Uron noodles to be. But you definitely get your money's worth. \n\n-1 star for no ramen, -1 star for thin udon noodles. I will go back though as it was a decent lunch and for 7 bucks, pretty reasonable.", "author": "Angelo F."}

You know what you're getting yourself into when you eat here.  \n\nMy beef teriyaki was all right, but why ask me how I'd like it prepared if you're just going to make it well done anyway?  \n\nAnd too much dressing on the salad.  Too much.", "author": "Marcus C."}

For me, Niji is a one of the good!\n\nThe wait is very average - on the short side.  Staff is friendly and fast.\n\nTheir Miso soup (and I love some good miso) is awesome.  Their chicken teriyaki is fantastic.  I love their Teriyaki Combo (salad, rice, broccoli and a nice portion of chicken).  \n\nToday, I opted for a little less \"low cal\" option, and had the chicken Katsu.  Good stuff.  Not greasy, not re-warmed.  I love the katsu sauce- kind of a combination of Teriyaki and Worchesteshire sauce.. yummy!\n\n\nWhile I was there, I watched a paper reciept fall from a tray of food that was being prepared- and it hit the floor.   I watched as the \"front man\" picked it up-to see what he would do.. IN the garbage it went.  WHEW... \n\nI suggest you give this place a try-  if you dont like it, Im sorry- but I am a fan.", "author": "Mike H."}

Why don't they just call it teriyaki chicken in a rice bowl?\n\nIf you've ever had proper donburi, the meat is cooked with egg in a savory sauce.\n\nWhen I asked them about it, they just gave me a blank stare...\"Oh we don't do that way\" \n\nI guess it's okay if you don't know any better.", "author": "Nopadon W."}

Anywho , it tasted decent . The sauce that came with it was kind of nice . It also came with rice , salad , and miso soup which all tasted pretty decent . I also had the spicy tuna roll which was okay .. but not really something that stands out to me or that I'd rave about . It was almost forgettable .", "author": "Eileen L."}

No joke. For those of you who say the chicken teriyaki is dry, well, you are wrong. Another thing to remember is that unlike all the other CHEAP Japanese restaurants in SF, Niji uses all juicy, all white, breast meat, instead of, unhealthy, poor people mystery dark meat! It's clean, healthy, juicy, white meat! \nNot only is their chicken great, but also the beef teriyaki. I will admit, I did get the tempura six years ago and was very disappointed with the dipping sauce (key in great tempura), so I have stuck with the Chicken Teriyaki. Anyway, Niji is great. No msytery meat and a decent price.", "author": "Edward B."}

This portions were generous and the service was quick, but my gyu don (thin slices of beef over rice) was really fatty! Of course that didn't stop me from eating the entire thing, but I would think that they could at least trim the large pieces of fat off the \"lean\" meat. It was sort of like eating sauteed bacon. Even though, I will come back to try more stuff for a better assessment.", "author": "Charlene C."}

All in all, for a combination of taste, price ($7.76 with tax) and speed...this place is great! I am a big teriyaki fan, but haven't found too many good places....the teriyaki place behind my work at 555 market, is ok...but not that great. This plate leaves you feeling full, but not like you want to vomit afterwards. Service was about 3 minutes from order to eating...Quick lunch that didn;t taste like it was made quick...chicken slightly dry, but still very tasty and not smothered in sodium laced teriyaki sauce! Good deal and fast...GET SOME!!!", "author": "Jason S."}

Tight and good.  Spicy Tuna Maki (4 large rolls that fell apart b/c the tuna pieces were strangely large and unwieldy).  I only went here b/c I was wandering around the Galleria on a hot day and wanted something cold to eat.  Wouldn't come here again unless I was carving for japanese and didn't feel like looking elsewhere.  For california roll and Spicy Tuna Maki, it was $9 and some change.
