I've actually been to the other Tierra Mia on Broadway in Oakland to meet a former colleague, but I threw balls to the wall and ordered one of their specialties, the sweeter than sweet Horchata Frappe (review: http://bit.ly/2xrOCDY). I noticed they serve that sugary confection here, but I tried to hold the reins tighter by ordering an 8-oz Cappuccino Italiano since it was a coolish afternoon even though I know it's a major faux pas to have cappuccino after 12 Noon (photo: http://bit.ly/2OEQT5O). I didn't get grief for my order, but I certainly got plenty of sugar as it was a most dessert-like drink for the middle of the afternoon. The chill vibe in here helped me nurse it before I tossed half of it away. No offense to the barista but it wasn't quite my taza de the.\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...a stellar cappuccino if you want something for dessert\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...relaxing vibe on this particularly urban stretch of Mission\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice crew here\nTOTAL - 3 stars...just sweeter than I wanted...or needed\n\nRELATED - Looking for dining options in Bernal Heights?

Stumbled upon this place. It was cute and homey feeling. Upon entering, there wasn't really anyone to greet me. Took them a while to notice I was there. She was nice when she came up to the register though. The whole ordering process had a feeling of confusion floating between me and the cashier. Not a big deal though. \n\nI ordered the Horchata Frappe with a shot of espresso added. MmMMmm good. The order came out about three minutes after I ordered it. It was caked in a nice wallop of whipped cream on top. The first sip was bomb oh my goodness so good. It really was an amazing first sip! As time progressed however, I found myself getting overwhelmed by it. It took quite some effort to drink. Maybe ordering a medium for myself wasn't the best idea. I'd be more than elated to come back and order it again in a size small! \n\nI was also recommended to try the Coco Loco. My friend isn't a coconut fan and neither am I, but she said that it was really good. So, I'll have to come back for that!", "author": "Kim N."}

Tierra Mia has a rustic scheme and a good middle ground between a bar in the SOMA and a local roaster. The barista guy happened to wear a white dress shirt which makes it seem like he was a server at a fancy restaurant. I decided to go with the horchata cream blend instead of the horchata latte today. I didn't realize there was such a huge difference between the two. Nonetheless, still good and still Tierra Mia quality. I think it would be cool if they had booths here but there's a Burger King and many diners close by. Its a great place to work on your laptop. The WiFi info is near the cashier. I tend to always end up getting up to look at the WiFi information again. Snapping a quick pic does the trick for me.

I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of milk in there, so later I did go for another shot of espresso, but they charged us $2.5 for that shot, since it was not ordered with the drink.. so.. meh. lol.\n\nDrawn by the pastry window, I also asked about where they source their baked goods; turns out it's from this french baker in Oakland, who used to have his own bakery, but now he just delivers fresh pastry to coffee shops around SF.

Nope, me neither!!...but I'd imagine it would taste something like Tierra Mia's horchata latte frappe. Hot diggity dog. A little sweet, a lot creamy, and horchata-y topped with plenty of whip and cinnamon. Liquid crack or heaven in a cup. Seriously. My only suggestion? Don't get the small. According to my girlfriends, the Mexican chocolate latte frappe is even better! Whaaat?!? No way! Husband thoroughly enjoyed his coffee too (and they rotate plenty of excellent coffees).\n\nThankfully located in Bernal Heights where it is far less hairy than the rest of San Francisco, Tierra Mia is easy to access (at the corner of Valencia St & Mission St). Street parking is plentiful within a block radius and the coffee shop is really cute - lots of LA-Latino tribute art and plenty of seating.

There's a little yard in the back, with a tree to block out the sun, and there's outside seating next to the entrance as well.\n\nThe coffee is too sweet for me. They had ~5 kinds of iced coffee, and I ordered the first one on the list, hoping it would be the most basic version (Horchata), but it ended up being a very sugary frappuccino-style drink. All the iced coffees come with whipped cream (which thankfully I asked to NOT have while ordering), which just goes to show how this place specializes in sweet, thick coffee.\n\nThe hours are also very early. I tried to visit this place several times before, and it's always \"closing time\", so the time window for visiting is very small. Not a really good place to sit and surf the net--before you know it, the place is closing, and you'll have to find another coffee shop", "author": "Henry L."}

Normally I am not much into the Frappe drinks including the popular Starbucks' version. I was amazed on how the blended beverage tasted and in all desperation; I needed to buy one for myself. \n\nShe told me where she got it from. And I did not know there was a Tierra Mia Coffee shop in San Francisco. The Latino coffee chain is based out of Los Angeles. Many yelpers from So-Cal raved about this coffee chain.  So I had to pay this coffee house a visit. \n\nFinding this chained coffee house was not a problem. It is located on Mission and Valencia near Bernal Heights. When I got there, I saw a good vibe from this place. I did ordered that Medium Horchata Frappe. For $3.95, you get the Horchata beverage with some caffeine and ice blended in a loud blender until the entire combine ingredients incorporate all together with a cloud of whipped cream and a touch of cinnamon on top.  I actually like this drink. This is a blended beverage you do not find anywhere. I also ordered a small Palmier cookie for $.50. My treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tierra-mia-coffee-san-francisco?select=1oHQtOcem9MBZrBvN1ifoA#IAC-Ubx-2WEwaH2nhzvPzA\n\nAs I was sipping on my beverage, I was enjoying the shop's upbeat Latin tunes. Sitting in those comfortable couches have a nice feel. I was watching the friendly baristas preparing the house coffee, one drip at a time. I might come back and try the coffee in the morning. \n\nI am on the Tierra Mia Coffee bandwagon. I believe the hype.", "author": "Matt G."}

The latte is a bit on the sweet side. The espresso and milk still shines through despite the prominent flavor of cinnamon (and presumably rice). I've also tried their espresso and though I've had better, it's still pretty delicious. They have blended ice drinks as well (frappes) and of course, pastries like ham and cheese croissants, palmiers, cookies, etc. \n\nThe place is very warmly decorated with rich hues of brown, cushy leather seating, victorian lamps, and several sturdy tables to do some work, catch-up with a friend, or get lost in a newspaper (yes, some people still read print papers!) or a book (another dying diversion). Despite Tierra Mia being known as a coffee shop grassroots-founded by Latina/os (I first heard about Tierra Mia living in LA's San Gabriel Valley), this location draws in a diverse clientele. I've seen young college students, families, older gay couples, and middle-aged women across racial background hanging out. That's very refreshing and welcomed! The cafe is also surrounded by glossy photographs of coffee fields, crops, and workers who provide the product we enjoy so much --- coffee! \n\nThe baristas are quite friendly and it seems the staff have a great rapport with each other. They are jovial, personal (OK. I may have eavesdropped in a couple of their conversations. Come on. It's a coffeehouse!), and helpful. And while I've listed a handful of praises, one final praise: Tierra Mia pipes in some awesome Spanish music... Gypsy Kings, Celia Cruz, cumbia, salsa, Tejano, and rock en espanol. As a native Angeleno, I have to say I feel quite at home here. Though I live quite far from Tierra Mia, I will have to make this one of my go-to spots. Te amo, Tierra Mia.", "author": "James Z."}

However, when I walked in, there was no line.  No drinks where being made or back ordered. The two baristas were just talking to each other and completely disregarded me when I walked up to the counter.  Okay fine, maybe they were having an off day.  \n\nThe Horchata latta caught my eye as I love espresso and I love horchata. what a fantastic combination!  I asked about it- how many shots go in a medium, how do they make it, is it very sweet, etc.  I love coffee, I know it's a drag to talk about menu items, but this was my first time here, I was curious.  I got one word answers.  Fine, I stopped asking questions, placed my order, and sat down. \n\nThe Horchata Latte: \nIt wasn't hot- it wasn't hot, wasn't cold, just kind of perfectly warm, but I prefer my espresso drinks blistering hot.  My fault, I didn't specify that when I ordered.  I, personally, find this drink too sweet for my taste as I generally enjoy the bitterness of coffee but, that being said, it is a fantastic drink.  I'd highly recommend it to any coffee drinkers with a sweet tooth.  Espresso and horchata meld very well together.  \n\nThe setting: \nThe cafe itself is very cute, spacious, and clean.

Ever since, a certain kind of coffee shop triggers a pavlovian response in which I start getting shit done. This is one such coffee shop.\n\nTierra Mia has a great italian, granite coated interior that is the antithesis to the other understated coffee shops in the area. Its metaphorical tie and suit tails puts me in a work state that leaves my check lists littered with, well, checks.\n\nTo boot, they've also got great expresso beans and, if you're feeling frivolous, a killer Horchata Latte.

I dream about it! The interior is nicely done and they play music at just the right volume. A few people come here with laptops and it seems to be a nice place to work. I regret not coming here when I worked from home because it seems like a chill place. Despite being a bespoke coffee house, it hasn't been overrun by hipsters. Not sure why, given it's location on Mission and vicinity to Valencia hotspots. \n\nThe only negative is that because they really care about your coffee, it does take a while to get it. An iced coffee took about 6-7 minutes, which can be fine, but when there isn't much of it, waiting doesn't seem very rewarding or worthwhile. I could stand the wait if there was more coffee to enjoy afterward.", "author": "Amy .."}

After an evening of slinging back too many boozy concoctions, a gal is in need of a few things: water, coffee, and a hearty breakfast. At least Tierra Mia was able to supply me with two of those bare necessities. \n\nI asked what the milk options were, and the only non-dairy one was soy. I scanned their menu, but went with my standard soy latte. \n\nIt was very rich, smooth, almost buttery tasting, with just the right amount of foam. The espresso was delicious. Very subtle. If you want your coffee beverage to have a bit more of a kick, order an extra shot or two. \n\nSadly, mine was served in a to-go cup, and there was no latte art. I guess mastering the skill of steaming and serving soy takes a lot of practice. At least the flavor was there.\n\nTeeniest tiniest con: I would have liked if the barista had asked me if I wanted my beverage to stay, but I was a bit sneezy because of my seasonal allergies, so I understand why she probably wanted me out. I also looked a bit disheveled from my late night out and about, but oh well. We can't always step out of the house looking like goddesses. Only 90% of the time. ;)", "author": "Brandi W."}

The owner, Ulyesses, was there watching over things. It was pretty awesome to do a coffee tasting with him. He took the time to explain the different coffees and their flavours and he told us all about the company. We first discovered Tierra Mia in Los Angeles so we're stoked to see it up here. Sadly we live in Menlo Park so we can't wait to see one of their locations down here.\n\nMy favourites (blended drinks) are the Horchata Latte and Mexican Chocolate Mocha. The chocolate is so rich and flavourful. Reminds me of hot chocolate in Mexico City. Made with real milk etc. As for the \"real\" coffee I loved the Ethiopian. It was very fruity yet bold.\n\nThe staff has got to be the nicest team of barristas in the world. They were kind, accommodating, patient.\n\nI loved the decor in this particular location as well.

The only back fall to this is that the new staff being hired up here is new to the coffee industry and so are still young and fresh at truly understanding what good coffee is. Nonetheless there is always someone there with the longer experience to fully back up the new hires with any help possible. \n\nOTHER: after a sweet coffee drink there's a wide span of endless food possibilities to choose from; American, Spanish, Asian, Central American dishes, etc.", "author": "Joshua P."}

Also I'm not a big coffee guy or expert and I understand living here in S.F. coffee is HUGE here but for someone looking for something sweet and tasty with a hint of coffee this is my kinda place.", "author": "Joshua P."}

They tell you they have WIFI, but  if you have an apple computer  apparently some days it will work and some days it won't.  According to management they are working on getting it fixed.  If they fix it I would be more than happy to change my review to 5 stars because my coffee was good.  But given that I visited the shop to study,  being kicked off the internet multiple times made the trip a waste of time and money for me.", "author": "Michelle C."}

Also, the space is quite nice ; good service. Occasionally the music is just slightly louder than it needs to be, and I wish they had some more food/snack options -- more than just sweet pastries -- but otherwise this is a fine establishment that services excellent coffee.", "author": "Rick S."}

Their specialty drinks (horchata latte and Mexican chocolate mocha), are too sweet for our taste, kind of like starbucks type sugar drinks.  But you can just tell them to make them less sweet.
