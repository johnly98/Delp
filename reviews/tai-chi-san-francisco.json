It's been better the last few times I have ordered!  The last time I asked for more spicy and they did a nice job.   The dim sum options they have are pretty good as well.  I have not been in the restaurant in quite a while, these reviews are purely for delivery service and quality.\n\n*****previous 2 star review*******\nThis place can be good if it could be consistent.  Last week I ordered generals chicken and a wonderful, spicy dish was delivered.  It was delicious.  Today I ordered the same and I got a dish that I think is chicken (could be pork) smothered in sweet and sour sauce with no spice at all.  It is the most sweet and sugary sauce I have tasted on chicken.  Could not eat it but fortunately Eat24 has refunded as they saw the picture and agreed it did not look like the right dish.\n\nWas bummed as the chicken I had last week was great.  Consistency is definitely key", "author": "Kristine K."}

They were my go-to exclusive Chinese food delivery for over 4 years. In my search for a replacement, to quote the great Bono, I still haven't found what I'm looking for. \n\nJust ordered this for delivery via Eat24. I'm rounding up to 2 stars due to the speed of delivery, the estimate was 60-70 minutes, but it arrived in 24 minutes.\n\nWe ordered the orange chicken, garlic chicken, and chicken fried rice. The portions are generous, that's about the only good thing. \n\nThe chicken in both the rice and garlic chicken was thinly sliced, and appeared to be mostly white meat... but it was super rubbery, no thanks. Additionally the chicken in the fried rice was as pale as the rice, not sure how that happens. \n\nGarlic Chicken: had a brown sauce, I didn't quite pick up on any garlic flavor, although I saw whole cloves of garlic mixed in with the over abundance of water chestnuts. The sauce was also on the greasy side. \n\nOrange Chicken: I didn't have this, but my bf did. He said it was pretty spicy and didn't eat much of it.", "author": "Amanda F."}

Yet another review from this office worker.\n\nSiu mai (pork dumplings): Slight (normal, expected) pork flavor, perhaps even a bit on the dry side but I like that better than oily.\n\nHar gow (shrimp dumplings):  Skin was on the thicker side of things and interefered with the pairing with the shrimp. The shrimp filling was fine, although, again, on the dry side of things again. The skin on this tasted a bit perfumey-- as if someone had washed their hands with soap and then kneaded the flour, which is great, hygenic and all, but...not really a taste you want in food?\n\nShrimp with three kinds of mushroom: Well, they didn't skimp on shrimp in the dish, which is always nice. Still had a bit of soy sauce / oil on it, despite my healthy less oil and soy sauce pleas, but significantly less than normal. Shrimps were tender, not overcooked. Some were cooked to still be springy in your mouth-- just the way I like them. Green peas were not stringy.\n\nA solid spot for American-style Chinese food.", "author": "Nicole H."}

My first suspicion was to think, \"oh... the ol' bait-n-switch routine huh?\", but it was probably a miscommunication.  \n\nIn any case, the proper thing to do would be to match the price and tell the webmaster or whomever to fix the price issue later, but the former at least was not done.

I've lived in the neighborhood for a number of years now and have reacquainted myself with this restaurant. I was disappointed years ago and am happy to see that they've redeemed themselves. I always make a point to order their pork potstickers, very flavorful with the hint of ginger. I have ordered the chicken chow mein a couple of times but have discovered that the Hong Kong style is even better, $1 more but worth it. Some of my other faves: Mushu pork, green bean prawns. Will be trying more dishes in the near future and will update when I do so.", "author": "Kim L."}

She said no because it's not good that way. Like what? Who are you to tell the customer what they like? So I ended up getting the regular version which was extremely over priced.

You get soup, chicken and rice for 7.25. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside, moist on the inside (not over cooked), slight spice from a sprinkling of red pepper flakes was a good touch.

The beef used to be delish but these days resemble boiled beef in runny sauce.  \n\nBut here's the deal, after a year and half of it's-OK-Chinese-food-Friday-night-take-out, I ordered the Hunan fish and kung pau tofu this Friday past and came down with a bad case of food poisoning 8 hours later! Like it wiped me out and I was bedridden for 24 hours!\n\nI called them yesterday to let them know and after a bit they said they would give me a store credit to which I said, \"I'm never going to order from you again\" - I mean, would you? So, they refunded me my $22.83 - I know, small check but hey it's the principle that counts.\n\nAfter that the girl said, \"We use fresh ingredients that are delivered daily\" - honey listen, whatever you say along this vein is going to hurt you more because if you truly do use fresh ingredients and someone got food poisoning, then that means your food handlers did not practice good hygiene, OK? So pick your battle, should I call the Dept. of Health to let them know then? \n\nAnd this food poisoning was no just upset tummy thing, I'll spare the my fellow Yelpers the gory deets.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-23", "description": "It pains me to write this review as I have been a loyal customer to Tai Chi for over ten years! When I lived in the city, I would eat here numerous times a month, ALWAYS delicious food and I never went anywhere else; even when I moved to the Peninsula I still would make the trek to Polk & Broadway to get the best Chinese food, hands down! When I moved away from the Bay Area I still would go to Tai Chi EVERYTIME I went to the city, it was a given with my family, they knew that within any plans that we had that involved the Bay Area, we would HAVE to go to Tai Chi. I recommended the restaurant to all of my friends and family and everyone loved it! Last year in October, when I went to the City to a concert with some friends, I introduced them to the magic that WAS Tai Chi and they too agreed how delicious it was and the best Chinese cuisine that they have ever had. This past summer, when attending a concert in Mountain View, my friends and I made the detour to San Francisco to enjoy Tai Chi.....here's where the nightmare begins.....\n     Upon entering the restaurant I immediately noticed a change in the d\u00e9cor, the menu's had changed, (horrible grammar and spelling mistakes), and I also noticed the shrine in the back by the bathroom. I thought, okay, this is cute; however when we sat down to our sticky table, I knew something was up. I pulled out a Clorox wipe to wipe down the table, right when our server arrived, she saw what I was doing and looked pissed, but like I'm going to eat on a dirty table and she did not offer to clean the table. This set the tone for the service we received as the server came back and forth with a tight smile and was not very friendly. I ordered my usual chicken fried rice, General's Chicken, and the delicious Garlic Chicken! My friends ordered fried prawns, shrimp fried rice, and kung pao chicken. After a lengthy wait, which I knew was strange because the restaurant was not that busy and usually our food arrives very quickly, a dish was put on the table that looked like mushrooms, and bell peppers covered in a gooey brown sauce. I asked the server what it was and she said garlic chicken, I said \"no, this is not garlic chicken,\" (as the garlic chicken that Tai Chi is famous for is delicious chicken saut\u00e9ed with garlic and accompanied by wonderful broccoli florets, there is NO sauce on it and definitely NO mushrooms,) I said \"is this a new recipe?\" And she said \"no\" and I said, \"I'm sorry I don't want this, this is not what I expected.\" The server grabbed the plate and stalked away. After some time the rest of the food was brought, I immediately noticed the difference in the chicken fried rice, (one of the things I loved about the fried rice at Tai Chi, is that it is not fried too dark, it's actually really light in color,) the rice that was set in front of me was the right color but it had huge chunks of chicken that no one bothered to chop up and it looked really rubbery and had an odd taste to it. My friends had similar complaints about their food , like it did not taste right; one of my friends had come there with me previously and she too even noticed that the food was different. The only thing that tasted the same was the Genera's Chicken; which was great! However, the meal was already ruined for me and I was really disappointed in the horrible service that we received as far as our water not being refilled, having to flag down servers, and having to go ask for boxes and our check.\n     I left the restaurant so disappointed and confused and after seeing the YELP reviews with experiences similar to mine, I understand that the new owners have really dropped the ball and have made a huge FAIL of what Tai Chis USED to be.\n      DEAR NEW OWNERS OF TAI CHI RESTAURANT:\nNEW PAINT, DISHES, AND SHRINES DO NOT ENSURE THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF YOUR RESTAURANT, THE DELICOUS FOOD THAT LONG TIME CUSTOMERS OF TAI CHI HAVE COME TO KNOW AND LOVE, DOES! I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU GET IN CONTACT WITH THE PREVIOUS OWNER AND THEIR CHEFS TO TRY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE QUALITY OF FOOD THAT PATRONS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT HAVE GOTTEN USED TO. OTHERWISE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE LOYAL CUSTOMERS/FANS AND YOU WILL REALIZE THAT ALL THAT MONEY POURED INTO THE DECOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON BETTER INGREDIENTS AND CHEFS. ALSO, BRING BACK THE OLD GARLIC CHICKEN, IT WAS SO DELICIOUS! I AM ONLY ONE PERSON, BUT I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL PATRON TO TAI CHI FOR OVER TEN YEARS, AND I AM SAD TO SAY, I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE.\n:-(", "author": "Tessa M."}

After all, this is the strip of Polk that boasts Nick's Crispy Tacos and Miller's East Coast Deli. But sure enough, here is Tai Chi to save the day for Russian Hill residents and the rest of us willing to brave the 19-line to come here.\n\nIt's a good-size space but unassuming, not offering much on decor. Energy seems wisely placed on the food, and judging from the number of paper bag orders on the counter, they must do a booming take-out business. Jamie W. and I came here as we were strolling toward Fort Mason. We went for two standbys - a hefty Mongolian Lamb dish for $9.50 and the $8.50 Three-Ingredient Seafood Chow Fun, which was a bit too oily for my taste.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the three ingredients were prawns, scallops and I think some kind of whitefish. The portions are generous, and there was no brown sauce to be seen on anything. It all tasted fresh all things considered. I would put this one on par with Red Jade on Church. Its just good to know that a little exploration yielded a viable option for good Chinese food.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...liked it and was surprised I did\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...on the sparse side, not much to the place really\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...fast enough, friendly enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I'll round up for the portions and the freshness", "author": "Ed U."}

I've also found that items I asked for were missing on numerous occasions.\n\nAs for the food itself, I've experienced widely varying results.

The $3.25 deep-fried and flakey appetizer had an overpowering taste of onions fried up similar to a side of Naan bread.  \n\nI had a craving for a plate of Mongolian Chicken over rice. For $5.95, you get the leanest pieces of chicken meat with chopped scallions, onions and bits of dried chili peppers in a spicy sauce with a heaping scoop of rice. For a guy who loves spicy food, I find my tasty rice plate tolerable enough for anybody .i.e. my kids who can't stand spicy food and enjoy the rice plate without the spiciness interrupting their taste buds. \n\nThe kids split an order of the General Tsao Chicken over a heaping scoop of rice. For $7.50, you get chicken pieces fried up covered with a tangy sauce. This rice plate is classified as a spicy dish, I had a bite of their chicken and their shared plate is perfectly tolerable enough for my kids to eat and enjoy, even with continuous refills of iced water by the attentive waiter and waitresses. \n\nThey also do delivery services here, but only within the Russian/Nob Hill area. Credit cards are accepted. (You expect my kids to pay).\n\nThis restaurant is a favorite of Yelp, Zagat and CitySearch, with their respected stickers posted on the door.\n\n(My review is one of their favorites).", "author": "Matt G."}

I think there was maybe one or two pieces of basil none which fused with any of the other flavors in the dish. Probably could have done without the string beans altogether. The other veggies in the dish were also under cooked and over cut making it almost impossible to get a bite of all of the ingredients in one grab with the chop sticks and the plum sauce left a lot to be desired.

I had not yet moved to the Bay Area and had come out for a job interview. It was a transitory period and during my first delicious Tai Chi meal I was amazed at the spiciness of their General Tso's chicken and hot and sour soup. We ate there the Friday night before my job interview.  I got the job, moved to the Bay Area, and had found a new favorite restaurant and favorite dish. Over the past 36 years I have been here dozens of times with lots of folks. For the most part, my friends agreed that this was indeed a special place. I have thought if I were to have my last meal on earth, Tai Chi's General Tso's chicken would be on my menu. Many a time when I found myself at a different Chinese Restaurant, I would order this dish and be disappointed. It simply paled in comparison to Tai Chi's.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-03", "description": "A few things you need to know about Tai Chi's food.\n\n1.  If you want healthy, low-salt, low-fat, low-oil, lightly-seasoned, lovingly-crafted Chinese food?  This aint it.  This is for your I-have-an-urge-to-mow-down-on-some-delicious-American-style-Chinese-food-gimme-gimme-om-nom-nom!  What Tai Chi does right is marrying sweet+piquant in their sauces.\n\n2.  Unlike so many Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, Tai Chi has a surprising array of pretty good tasting entrees.  I dig that!  Don't you get tired discovering that a restaurant can only seem to make one, maybe two dishes to your liking? \n\n3.  This is NOT one of those San Francisco Chinese restaurants that seem to use the same sauce base in every single  dish.  Hooray!\n\nOnward to reviewing the food!\n\nAppetizers - SKIP.  I've tried to pot stickers -- the filling is fail.  Steam dumplings? Same.   I've bitten into the spare ribs -- unremarkable.  Egg rolls?  Nah.  If you must have your dumplings? I'm telling you, pass and order another entree instead.\n\nSoup - I don't order soups, sorry.\n\nEntrees.  Some of my faves:\n\n1.  Hunan General Tso's Chicken:  the classic, Chinese-American dish done to perfection by sparing not one calorie to ensure ultimate flavor.  No veggies, just deep-fried meat in a scrumptious sticky-sweet and savory sauce. You'll wanna spoon the goopy sauce over rice, it is crack-sauce;  extra-crispy batter, tender chicken chunks *ask for white meat if you don't like thigh meat* -- and for delivery, they do make an effort to keep the chicken crispy by popping open the corner of the container. Alas, the pieces on the bottom will get soggy; nothing much can be done. Do not expect this to reheat crispy.\n\n2.  Orange Beef:  Another veggie-less dish (unless you consider orange peel a veggie?) dry, slices of beef with an almost crispy mouth-feel submerged in a tongue-coating, spicy, savory brown sauce.  Eat side-by-side with the General Tso's for the ultimate, oral-gasmic experience.  Heads-up for the slices of orange peel, they can impersonate slices of beef (especially when reheated) so pick em out with your chopsticks, trust me you do not wanna bite into one.  Same for the many chili peppers - you'll wanna push those over to the side or pick them out.  Another, licking-it-off-your-plate sauce.\n\n3.  Shredded Pork With Brown Sauce:  strands of chew-licious pork with crunchy strings of bean curd in a subtle, pleasant, not-spicy brown sauce.  A nice departure from the flavor-bomb sauces I mentioned above.\n\n4.  Shanghai Chicken:  if you're not familiar, this dish features chunks of chicken in a tangy brown sauce with toasted pine nuts on the right-side next to chewy, tender seaweed on the left.  Eric's makes it drier, probably healthier too, but Tai Chi gives you more sauce.  Comes with thigh meat unless you ask for breast.\n\n5.  Spicy Chicken with Fresh Basil:  perhaps better known as Spicy Chicken with Crispy Basil, this is the well-known Thai-spiced delight featuring slices of white meat chicken, crunchy red and green bell peppers, sweet Thai basil in a succulent sweet-and-tangy sauce.  Perhaps your favorite Thai restaurant does it better but it's well worth ordering at Tai Chi.\n\n6.  Dry Braised Green Beans:  a piquant dish -- definitely not for a mouth that can't take much heat.  Toasty garlic and pepper seeds tossed over crunchy beans, it's simple, it's great.\n\nWrapping up this novelette by offering some criticisms:\n\nKung Pao [AnyProtein]:  unremarkable.  The peanuts aren't ever toasted to concentrate the flavor and the sauce is much too subtle so that the bell pepper flavors dominate.  For mind-blowing Kung Pao, try Andy's.\n\nNoodles:  I've had the Chow Mein, the Chow Fun, with black bean without... the noodle texture is fine but the flavor is very average. Noodles are not a strong suit of Tai Chi.\n\nMu Shi [a.k.a. Mu Shu]:  not offensive, but not particularly surprising - it's just ok.  \n\nTender Greens with Garlic Sauce:  was okay at the restaurant but the greens lost alot of their texture upon delivery.  It comes in the white garlic sauce, not the brown.\n\n***\nTL;DR version:  What is Tai Chi about?  Extremely tasty, sweet-and-tangy sauces that DONT all taste the same and a surprising number of yummy entrees set Tai Chi apart and above from your typical, American-style Chinese restaurant.  \nPerhaps not the healthy choice but you will enjoy every calorie.

I wasn't attacked  by rats and I didn't actually get sick, but I think that is the only reason I would give it one star. They DO serve food there. I only popped in because the line at Nick's Crispy Tacos was too long and it had been awhile since I had good Chinese food. Sadly, it has still been awhile since I have had good Chinese food. \n\nMy meal was terrible, my companion's meal was terrible. It did come out quickly, but everything was somehow both bland and over salted. How do you ruin shrimp chow mein? Ask the people at Tai Chi, I'm sure they can tell you. Anything with sauce apparently comes over cooked with too much sauce. With a hot tsunami of crappy sauce. I'm all over MSG and still, couldn't finish it. My taste buds didn't want me to finish it. Even though I was pretty hungry. We declined to take our food to go. It was so bad, I would rather leave hungry and reject the food I already paid for. I rate this place below the place I went to years ago (now closed) that actually had a rodent run through the joint while I was eating my dinner. That place, up until the lone rodent marathoner sighting, actually had tasty eats. \n\nAs I was leaving I noticed a canister among the bottles and foodstuffs that had caught my eye once or twice while I was eating, upon closer inspection I saw it was Tinactin. As the can explained, it is used to treat jock itch and foot fungus. I'm not sure how to wrap this up, but to say in a city with thousands of restos and a street with a number of spots in both directions, there is no reason to eat at Tai Chi.

The food also came within 20 minutes. \n\nOnto the food. ZOMG the hot and sour soup was so perfect!! sometimes it's too sour or what not but this soup was the perfect balance of hot and sour and had a nice hint of the bambooy leek flavor that made me want to go buy a beer bong so i can hot and sour soup bong all of it so I wouldn't have to share.  \n\nThe fried rice was so DELISSHHHHHHHH.  It had that perfect flavor of what fried rice should taste like, not too bland but not too MSGish salty.  Also, it had that perfect hint of spiciness because we ordered it hot but it didn't overpower it where I want to drink 10 gallons of milk in 10 seconds.  \n\nOK, but the 3 ingredient seafood chowfun did not do it for me. I mean, I think i just made the mistake of ordering it because I thought it'd be like regular chow fun but it wasn't.  I mean I can appreciate the flavors even if it's not my personal liking, but the chow fun noodles were all stuck together too so it was super, extra bland.

I knew this place was under new management when I opened up the egg rolls box & found 2 mediocre small egg rolls. What a disappointment!

My husband and I have had many excellent meals from there, both eat-in and take-out over the period of years what with living a block and a half away from Tai Chi and we would even go there when we were visiting from elsewhere(we lived out of state for 12 years and then returned). Anyhow, they recently re-opened, and appeared to have the same menu with a few additions. Ever hopeful and glad to see that they finally re-opened, we went there this evening, along with a visiting friend. Such a bad experience with the combo of bad service, bad food and bad ambiance that we cut our meal short after eating the first appetizer, cancelling the rest of the order when the green onion pancakes(which used to be excellent)appeared to be a greasy pile of I don't know what that none of the three of us would touch. Fortunately we were able to get out of there with only having to pay for 2 beers and one appetizer, the \"fried prawns\" which were greasy and flavorless with an overly sweet sauce that came on the side.

They had been tempting me ever since I first saw them on the appetizer menu, but whenever I placed an order for delivery, Tai Chi was sold out.  Maybe they need a new kitchen manager.  Worth the wait, they reminded me of a better variation on the bar-fare mainstay, the jalapeno popper.\n\nI would avoid any of their salads.  I tried both the Tea Smoke Duck and the Seaweed Roman salad, but neither impressed. The Seaweed Roman salad in particular was bland.  Tai Chi would be better off sticking with the seaweed salad standard.\n\nI also tried the Pumpkin Chicken, looking for some new flavors, and I would comfortably recommend it to anyone.

The delivery guys are pretty nice too. Second time I ordered from them I missed the delivery b/c I was in the shower and they came 30 mins ahead of schedule. Both the driver and restaurant tried calling me at home and on my cell and left messages. When I finally got a hold of the driver he offered to return to the restaurant and redeliver.

It helped that I lived on Lombard about a 15 minute walk from this place.\n\nI remember Herb Caen's review of General Tso's chicken and from the first bite, to the last bite I had a few years ago when visiting, I was in dreamland. Simply the best. Service is always quick. I have never had a dish that I was disapointed with. Portions were always very generous, and usually enough for leftovers the next day.\n\nNow living in South Florida I can only dream of this oasis on Polk. When I had friends visit me from out of town, I would take them on the wharf, twin peaks, GG Park and elsewhere tour..but the last part of the tour was when I would tell them that they are about to taste the best Chinese food they ever had. And you know what...no one ever disagreed.", "author": "Jeff M."}

I work at the Wharf, and I've ordered food from here at least a dozen time.  They are very accurate on the delivery time, if not ahead of schedule.  \n\nThe food is always still very hot upon delivery.  Just be sure to ask for plates and utensils if you need, they don't generally provide unless asked.\n  \nAs for food, I love their pot stickers.  The dough is nice and chewy, and they are stuffed with a good amount of meat and veggies.  Definitely use their sweet chilli garlic sauce that they provide for dipping.  Screw all those other places that just give you soy sauce.  Tai Chi's special sauce is the best!\n\nGet the Chicken Corn Soup as mentioned by my fellow Yelpers.  It's nice and thick with corn, egg, and chicken.  Definitely very reasonable size for the price.  \n\nTry the Tung-An Chicken.  It's sauteed, in a spicy garlic saice with zucchini.  Chicken is always cooked perfectly, nice and tender.  \n\nIt's nice to have a Chinese restaurant that serves brown rice now a days. Definitely take advantage of it while enjoying Chinese food.  You are getting enough grease from everything else, you don't need to add to your gaining weight by eating white rice.  While I'm Chinese and love my rice, I love my health more!

Not as jam-packed as I'd prefer, but had some nice chunks of fresh crab in there.\n\nVegetarian Spring Rolls were tasty, not the least bit greasy.\n\nGeneral Tso's was pretty mouth-wateringly savory.  Just the right amount of sauce, great blend of flavors, I've had some that come out too sweet, and you can't eat too much without getting sick.  Not the Tso's here, it was pretty amazing.  It's just straight chicken though, some restaurants I've eaten at had actual peppers cooked in, and the Chicken sat on a bed of broccoli, I like having the Veges to cut the flavor, but still one of the best I've had.\n\nMy fiancee had the Mu Shi Vegetables, which she liked a lot, I snuck a few bites.  They are a little stingy with the rolls, and they fell apart a little easily, but good otherwise.\n\nOnly other real complaints is that they kind of skimp you on the usual goodies you get in your delivery bag.  Absolutely no Soy Sauce, no Fortune Cookies, no utensils, chopsticks or Fortune Cookies.\n\nDefinitely recommend them, they are my go to restaurant for urgent Chinese Food delivery from now on.", "author": "Tyler D."}

And I didn't wait long at all for my order.\n\nI had the popular General Tsao's Chicken which had a flavor of it's own and better than at other restaurants for the same dish. A little sweetness to it. The pot stickers were major plump/huge and cooked just right, crispy fried on one side in watered pan. No grease. I had the Moo Shu Beef. And I ordered Moo Shu Vegetarian to go for a friend. Both of us enjoyed our Moo Shu. I only wish they gave more of those roll up pancakes, because of the generous helping of Moo Shu. This is one of the few places that serves Moo Shu that's not just pork.  And Tai Chi's menu has a lot more to offer/order in it's selection.\n\nWell, I won't wait another 20 years to go back to Tai Chi's. I will definitely go back to try other things on the menu. I do remember having onion cakes from way back and that was still on the menu. That's a dish from another region of China. Tai Chi's has quality food, a wide selection, and at reasonable prices. Really worth trying out, if you haven't already. \n\nEasy to park in the area during the day.

I remember the first time I went to this restaurant, about 8 years ago. I didn't think it would be anything special because I was being judgemental I guess. It looked too casual so I just assumed it would be like any generic chinese restaurant. Was I dead wrong! I had the beef chow fun and the walnut prawns. There will never be anything equal to these two scrumptious meals--EVER. I took my sister who lives in So Cal about 7 hours away. To this day (years later), her mouth waters thinking of the food. I wish I could have their recipes. They're very nice, great service, and even if they were mean and had crappy service...it wouldn't matter because their food would override any negative aspect.", "author": "Hi H."}

I ordered the \"hot and spicy\" Twice cooked pork and a bowl of steamed rice. The food came quickly, good nice sign. But down hill from there. It did have a nice flavor, but the only thing hot about it was the temperature, I almost burnt my tongue on a few bites. NOT spicy at all. The pork was cut wrong, so much of it was very tough, some even tasted old. during my meal I was never asked if the food was alright, or even if I would like anything else.

The reason I chose this place was because yelp gave it 4 stars. Yelp steered me wrong this time. \n\nHow anyone could give this place more than 3 stars blows my minds. 4 out of the 7 dishes we ordered were unforgivable! yuck! \n\nI should have left as soon as I noticed there weren't any Chinese people eating there. \n\nTo begin with the cleanliness of the place is the main reason behind the sad star. The lazy susan had dirty oily streaks all over it, one plate had left over rice grains, 2 glasses of water had a lip stains and another had black speckled crust on the rim. One chopstick had a piece of wet paper stuck on it. \n\nI know when it comes to Chinese restaurants the rule is if they're not rude then it's not right. That much I expected. But when you have to ask for everything twice and still not get it then then it becomes a problem. \"Hot tea please...excuse me can I have hot tea?.... HOT TEA!!!!\" Finally the tea came, we also asked for another set of chopsticks and black pepper....it was like pulling teeth. The worst part was they weren't even busy. \n\nAs far as the food goes I ordered \n\nHot & sour soup - I've had a lot better but this will work if you don't know what you're missing. \n\nSweet & Sour Shrimp (I think that was the name of it)- it's shrimp that's been deep fried in batter and comes with sweet & sour sauce on the side. - 2 stars \n\nPot stickers - undercooked \n\nSalt & Pepper ribs - too salty \n\nSizzling beef & scallops - disgusting! the beef is foul. The texture of the beef was unusually soft. The scallop and beef combo is just strange and didn't go well together. \n\nThree Ingredients Seafood with garlic sauce Chow Fun - Ewww...There was a strange ingredient that I've never seen added before to this dish...sweet & sour sauce! WTH! \n\nGarlic Shrimp -This is the Only dish I liked and it wasn't anything to write home about either. The broccoli should have been cooked with the shrimp but it wasn't. It looked a little sad sitting around the side of the dish with no flavor. \n\nSomething that added to my dislike for this place is after ordering all these dishes they ask if I want rice. I hate when restaurants do this...Why wouldn't I want rice? What am I going to eat garlic shrimp and sizzling beef with? \n\nI guess you should order out to avoid being disgusted with this place if you still are planning on eating their food.", "author": "Jamaree C."}

The food is always properly packaged, hot, and clean.  They have a vast menu including the heavy, sweet, fried dishes to appease the american palate as well as the more traditional lighter dishes to please the chinese crowd. \n\nOnly complaint is that ive gotten my food a couple times, got into eating position..only to not have any utensils in the bag.  \n\nIn football terms, a methodical, pound the rock type drive with the occasional play action pass that ends in a dive over the goal line.

My girlfriend and I spent about 30 minutes searching through all of our fliers and yelp reviews looking for something that pinged our interest. We were stuck between walking to pick something up or sitting on our lazy butts at home waiting for someone to bring food to us. We went with the latter and, since most delivery is either pizza, Chinese, Thai or Indian, we went with Chinese. We've had a ton of different Chinese places around Nob Hill - some fantastic, some just okay. \n\nTai Chi is great for quite a few reasons - first, the delivery was fast. second, the menu had some unique sounding dishes  (compared to your general fried rice and broccoli beef place), third, the food tasted great except for just one item, which I will go into later on. \n\nWe ordered pork fried rice, shanghai chicken, crispy chicken wings, potstickers and curry beef chowmein. The shanghai chicken was cool - it came with a pile of small chunks of chicken in a tasty sauce with a side pile of \"crispy greens.\" This dish was unique. It looks like they crisped up some kind of herb, not sure. It went well with the friend rice. The crispy chicken wings were AWESOME. They are definitely a MUST get. My favorite dish was the curry chicken chowmein. I have never seen a Chinese place serve a curry chowmein. It worked as a great contrast to the typical take-out Chinese flavors. It wasn't heavy in curry, just lightly coated for noticeable flavor enhancement. \n\nThere were a few bad points though - the pork fried rice was just okay. Nothing special about it. The pot stickers sucked MEGA! They weren't crispy at all and the filling was bland. Just go for the chicken wings.", "author": "Matt S."}

The food is delivered cold and is not of the same quality ... more importantly they don't care anymore either.  Not only has the food suffered but the friendly attitude is gone ... This restaurant is trying to live on the reputation it earned in the past, food was good not too pricey and the people were very nice.  Now the food is cold, no one cares anymore .. it's not that it went from a fun experience to a so so experience; it went from a fun to a very bad experience.  You are wasting your time and money coming here.  Plenty of good Chinese restaurants in the city ... go somewhere else and let them learn the hard way.

The pork fried rice was too salty and the broccoli beef not salty enough so that it was oddly nearly tasteless.  The honey glazed prawns were not even glazed but merely fried with the glaze on the side. WTF?!  That's not even the SAME friggin' thing!  Even the fortune cookies were nasty and bland.

I spent the first 20+ years of my life in San Diego, and my family has been going to the same awesome Chinese restaurant for the last 15 years.  You have no idea how much I miss and crave that food almost every day.  But now, I am so happy I found Tai Chi because the food is almost as tasty.  My goal is to try everything on the menu so I can develop a big list of favorite items.

Too hospital room. Too unproven. Too bright. And the stark wall decorations and half-finished beautifiers leave a little something to be desired visually. I presume that it is for those reasons that rarely will I see Tai Chi at more than half its capacity - an ominous sign for a neighborhood restaurant. \n\nBut it was recommended by a trustworthy source, and out of respect and curiosity I snagged a takeout menu on my walk home some time last fall. For a number of reasons, I was not disappointed.\n\nThe first of them is that the General Tso's chicken is nothing short of outstanding, in terms of price, flavor, and quantity. One order will handily serve two eaters with nothing but rice to complement it. The fried wontons are also not to be underestimated.\n\nAs a delivery restaurant, it is amazing to see them in action. These guys make the Beijing Opening ceremonies look amateurish. I have ordered, hung up the phone, and heard a knock at my door within 6 minutes from a kid on a bike with my food. No shit. It defies logic how fast these guys can show up sometimes. \n\nA fact that I resent about myself is that I love Panda Express. I literally lose control of my limbs and bee-line to the loving arms of orange chicken at its faintest scent (seriously, it's pathetic. For more info, see my review of Panda Express). I describe Tai Chi as a (slightly) classier, yet just as affordable, better quality, restaurant version of Panda Express. \n\nThis may not sound like much to you. I wish it didn't to me.

I lived on Russian Hill for years (moved in 1993) and have been going to the Tai Chi since the eighties, when it still had the red wallpaper, pseudo-wood paneling and chinese lanterns.  Yes, that long.   I've recommended it countless times.  I've persisted through the renovations (I think I count four now), I've lived through the upgrades to the tables, cutlery and plates.  But, I am considering abandoning my long-time favorite, since the last two visits have been disappointing, the last one, yesterday, July 2nd, particularly so.   I always order the same thing:  potstickers, dry-braised green beans, and general tso's chicken, and always take a bunch home to eat over the next several days. The beans marinated nicely overnight, and the chicken was great cold.  Not anymore.  At the restaurant, the potstickers, usually a combination of soft and beautifully browned dough, were too soft, almost gummy  (though the filling tasted good), the beans were distinctly salty.  The chicken was the major disappointment --  the sauce had a harsh aftertaste of vinegar, and the batter was thick and chewy, not crunchy.  They served pre-packaged fortune cookies that were not worth eating.  Today, I tried the beans (they used to be swimming in a nice soy marinade by the next day) and they were OK, but only just that.  The chicken is edible but ho-hum.  I miss that lovely hot-honeyed sauce.  I have to conclude they changed chefs as well as owners.  Very sad.

Perhaps a bad batch? Who knows. I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2 because I feel they deserve the benefit of the doubt on that one. Albeit, I was impressed that the delivery was extremely fast, online ordering super easy with a well built website, and the prices very competitive. BUT the food was fairly Americanized, ho-hum not ho-ho-sic! And I'm very much A in the ABC of things! I'm happy that they didn't waste any paper napkins and plastic forks on me. For that I give them kudos. I threw out the fortune cookies which were unfortunately stale. And with a big sigh my 3 year long search for a favorite Chinese food delivery place in the City goes on...either that or I need to get off of my lazy butt and walk down the hill to Chinatown for something more authentic.

Somehow, the American version of chinese food where meat is flash fried and drenched in some sweet sauce does not appeal to my taste-buds.  That was until I finally stumbled upon Tai Chi at SeamlessWeb.com.  Oh, my tummy thanks thee!\n\nMy 3 favourite dishes:\n1. Scallops with Chinese Vege - they are very generous with the scallops, the vege's always fresh with the right amount of crunchiness and the sauce, oh the sauce - full of flavor with that hint of ginger.\n2. Tea-smoked duck - this was surprisingly good!!! The duck was perfectly crisp with the right amount of seasoning.  And the portion is huge!\n3. Beef in black bean sauce - tender slices of beef in fermented black beans, as authentic as the ones I get back home.  Yummy.\n\nThis is now one of my favourite take-outs ever!  Food is always hot and NOT soggy when it arrives,  portions are huge and the prices are amazingly cheap, especially the lunch specials.", "author": "Karen Y."}

I really did enjoy the low mein, and we usually ordered another meal to fill the platter which satisfied.  But, after the last experience it may have been the last.  We got lo mein, and mixed veggies with chicken.  Oh yes... and the hot and sour soup.  When we opened everything up, I had a sip of the soup and it was too hot, so luckily for me, that was the last taste I had of it.  My girlfriend met another fate.  She had about half of a mediocre bowl of the soup, and came down with a case of the old food poisoning.  To say the very least, she had a miserable night.  I've heard that hot and sour soup has been known to do this, as certain places will just keep a bowl in the kitchen until its gone.  Letting it heat and cool repeatedly.  Until its gone.  So, after this experience I probably will try a new place and felt like I should probably fill in the masses as well.", "author": "William B."}

However, 'chinese' food as prepared in the US is my least favorite cuisine b/c it's usually super greasy, MSG laden, flavorless gut buster.  I used to reserve it only as a hangover cure but after discovering Tai Chi several years ago, will actually choose to eat and ENJOY it from time to time.  I've sample them all and Tai Chi is hands down, the best Chinese (American) restaurant in SF--no MSG side effects and great flavor. Tai Chi's hot n sour soup is the best. They also do a great Moo Shu. The noodles are lackluster; I'd stick with main dishes.  I agree with other yelpers, the best test of a chinese restaurant is usually the fried rice (which I haven't tried b/c I prefer to make my own) and the hot n sour soup.", "author": "Linda Y."}

The roomates were gone, I'd been wine tasting all day, basketball was on and I pulled up the trusty delivery.com to see what sort of junk food I could get delivered to my doorstep to put me into a food coma.  I had an order all ready for a couple of other places, then checked their Yelp credentials, only to find some disappointment.  Tai Chi had the best reviews, so I ordered some eggplant, tofu and chow mein dishes from there (to get to the minimum for the delivery, not cause I binge eat after binge drinking, of course).  I blinked, poured some water into a glass, and my doorbell was aringing!  The polite delivery man, gave me 27 pounds worth of Chinese food and I dumped a bit of each into a bowl (I'm a flavor mixer on occassion.  Spices things up a bit).  It was delicious!  Seriously, the eggplant was great, the tofu was a flavorful and the chow mein wasn't too salty (I love MSG, but am fully aware of the health risks associated with it, so try to avoid it and they leave it out at Tai Chi).  Plus, it lasted me 5 solid meals.  I'm glad delivery.com saves orders, cause I'll be back.  It did, in fact put me into a food coma.  I laid down for a \"nap\" at 8pm and woke up Sunday at 8am.

The chicken buried under all that batter and sauce was chewy from being over-fried.  The orange beef was the best dish.  Again a bit too much sweet sauce and not enough hot spice.
