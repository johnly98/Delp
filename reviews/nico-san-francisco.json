(Or is my palate just not sophisticated enough?) Nonetheless, I was excited to dine at yet another Michelin rated restaurant. The weather was fairly good for the city and we were in the area. \n\nNico is located on Sacramento Street in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. There's only street parking around here. This area is fairly easy to find parking. We found a space right away. \n\nNico is another Michelin rated restaurant which serves daily prix-fixe meals with a set price. Their current menu consists of 5 courses for $70. The interior of the restaurant is similar to many other restaurants which serves up modern American fare. The vibe is hipster meets contemporary. There's an open kitchen in the back of the smallish dining room. Our server was friendly and helpful. Even though some of them didn't know the menu and ingredients that well, they tried to find the information for us. \n\nTo say we didn't like any of the dishes we were served would be wrong. We LOVED (LOVED WITH A PASSION I only reserve for the best of the best.) the Bone Marrow Madeleines which were served to us in the beginning of dinner service. It's just too bad that an appetizer became the highlight of what should've been a great Michelin rated experience. I've never had a savory madeleine before, not even in France. I was truly blown-away by the flavor of this soft treat. Everything else we were served after that was just meh to mediocre. To be able to get some more of these madeleines, one would have to pay to dine there again. That's something I probably won't do again if I had the choice. I will however become a returning customer if Nico ever decides to sell their Bone Marrow Madeleines individually to customers. You can count on that!", "author": "Julie W."}

The first two courses were pretty delicious. It was leek with mousse and the other one was a nicely seared scallop, so far so good. Then the third one, I was not feeling it at all. It was a fluke fish, it smelled and tasted very fishy and since it was just slightly seared, the taste was too much for me. My boyfriend and I was not a fan. Then came the suckling pork, that was very good! So fatty and tender! Then was the pre dessert and main dessert. Pre dessert was this pomegranate ice cream, honestly was too sweet, I told my bf to finish it. Then it was the main one, which was white chocolate in the middle and then cow milk.

On a holiday when so many restaurants dust off a fixed menu, why not go to Nico, where that format  is their core competence? \n\nPrior to the six courses, we were served a pair of butter and marrow-based madeleines. It was a delicious take on the French treat. \n\nThe snapper and apple held an innovative combination of flavors: tart and cinnamon blended with moderate fish flavors. It was fine. \n\nEgg custard with truffle and artichoke. This course was a symphony of savoriness, I could not have been more pleased.\n\nRadish layered with butter and seaweed powder. A clever deconstruction of what is apparently a traditional French dish. This was a strange, but still pleasant, experience. \n\nThe scallop dish was quite enjoyable.\n\nThe fifth course (a pithivier) combined pork and duck, within a soft pie-like crust. The merger of these two noble beasts was a brilliant coup.  \n\nThe dessert was based on a chocolate custard that was overwhelmed by the citrus of the clementine. \n\nAfter dessert, we received another set of madeleines. In contrast to the first two, these were sweet and sported a crispy surface.  \n\nWe left neither hungry, nor groaning from over-fullness. (Their excellent bread did play a role with this.) \n\nOccasionally (in the cases of the snapper and the desert) it felt like the chef's cleverness got in the way of making the dishes as enjoyable as possible. But I suppose this was balanced against an expansion of our culinary horizons. \n\nThe space is well decorated and service was excellent and friendly.", "author": "Mike B."}

It took reservations. It was not crowded. It was quiet enough that you one can have a conversation without screaming. Parking was very easy. 5 course tasting is a modest $70 a person. Modest is a relative term. It's modest for San Francisco and New York. And modest because this is a Michelin one star place.\n\nAlways think - could this place go to 2 stars? or 3? Such was the curse of Michelin stars. When you get one star, you can maintain your status quo a little by charging patrons a reasonable price, and then once you are two, the price per person jumps up to $400, and once you hit three, the sky is the limit, and one would consider oneself lucky if one is only paying $600 per person, without wine pairing. That's why... if you are seeking for good restaurants at a price you can afford (remember affordability being a relative term here), go for those new Michelin one stars, as they are still trying and they have not raised their five course meal to $400 yet. Like a good woman, you gotta catch them when they are young, or you'd have to wait for them to become widows.There are never enough good women around,  just like a good restaurant.\n\nNico is very good, especially comparing to other Michelin New American food in San Francisco. I liked their classic approach to dishes. Very simple to follow. Salted roe with avocado, then move onto pouched squid, then fish, then steak and finally a light and refreshing dessert. Very intuitive approach and progression is light to heavy, and you can add supplemental things like the savory fritters. \n\nThere are things that may not suit a finicky eater's need. For instance, while they can prepare dishes for those who are this or that intolerant, the daily changing tasting menu is filled with meat and fish, and is heavy on the sauce like you'd expect in French cuisines. That to me, is always music to my ears because there is nothing that I would not eat. Nothing. I also liked the surprise me daily menu changes. It makes eating out more of an adventure.\n\nReading prior reviews, the price already had gone up since August, from $65 pp to $70. It would likely mean, soon, this tasting menu of $70 pp will go up even more. So catch them while you can (still afford it).", "author": "Victoria E."}

An early 530 dinner on Saturday July 21. Nice location parking was ok. The new restaurant is quite attractive- clean surfaces\na pleasant nice hostess. Tables nicely set-- perhaps a bit too close( more on this later) Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. We decided to have the six course tasting menu and the wines. The first course was very good- yellowfin tuna presented just right. The oyster 2nd course was also great. We had the excellent non house made bread to soak up the sauces. Next was a another very good dish-sea bass. The 4th course was a quail that was so so. None of the dishes were very warm. It was more noticeable with this room temperature dish. The real disappointment were the 2 deserts - as another reviewer has said they were very similar- a fruit ice cream and then another fruit sweet. Then a nice Madeline(cookie). I was not certain whether or not this \"cookie\" was made on the premises- I/we think that a fine restaurant would want you(the customer) to go away with a GREAT final course. The wines were ok-- not worth the charge. I should have just had a good Pinot .\nBack to the service-- we felt rushed even though they were not that busy and they had a few empty tables. But the real turn off was a \"trainee\" waiter taking orders at the table next to us. His rear pocket was about 16 inches from my face. I said something to our waiter who said that he was a trainee and that he(our waiter) would say something to the \"trainee\" After another 3-4 minutes of seeing his rear pocket I finally asked him to move. Now they are aspiring to be a 1+ star restaurant. I think that the manager should have been advised so that he could intervene and say something to us-- remember this is an expensive prixe fix restaurant. We'll not be back", "author": "David C."}

I wanted to do a joint birthday celebration dinner/date night with a friend in this intimate, neighborhood Michelin restaurant. \n\nI had read the reviews and hesitated but I decided to give it a go. As soon as I was walking on Sacramento street, I loved where it was located in such a quaint spot, ambiance walking in was beautiful. The hostess was wonderful, took my coat, seated me right away. \n\nThey were wonderful in surprising us with personalized cards which was so much appreciated and their service started as an impeccable one but unfortunately it went downhill from there. \n\n1. Wine selection was amazing and server was very knowledgeable which was really nice. \n\n2. First two courses was very satisfying (Asparagus dish- actually this was an amazing dish and it was the highlight for me), salad was unique, well seasoned, balanced, solid!\n\n3. IF the main courses (which needs to be also a strong, solid highlight of the dining experience) were amazing or even good, I would not have given them a 3 star rating. THE FISH... So it was a Halibut. I've been to MANY french Michelin star restaurants and very high end restaurants BUT never had fish that was so undercooked (believe me, I love sashimi...) and chewy that my knife would NOT cut through the fish. SO... of course I politely ask and the server seemed to not really know how it should be cooked but this is when he started to get a little annoyed and we became an inconvenience.. UH OH... They take it back, thankfully second time around, cooked perfectly, just break off softly although I did have a big chunky salt in one bite but I let it go. \n\n4. Server comes and asks us how we would like our meat course to be cooked.. I said how is the lamb supposed to be prepared because I don't usually eat lamb but decided to be adventurous and he gave me a very passive aggressive response which is unfortunate -- that they can make it well done since we wanted our fish overcooked. This meat dish should have nothing to do with how I would like my fish cooked AND if you really knew the dish inside and out which I believe every server in a Michelin star should know... it was highly undercooked and chewy but that doesn't mean I want my lamb overcooked. I was very confused and at this point I was had to let him know how I felt a little by letting him know that \"no, the fish was extremely undercooked, but I usually like my meat cooked medium rare\" \n\n5. Lastly, desserts.. two thumbs down. I had a bite of each of the two and spoon was down back on the table. \n\nSad to say.. this experience was a poor one and I won't come back to this place. The server too.. really made us feel rushed when asking questions about the dish and made us feel like an  inconvenience.. didn't know too much about the dishes and how it should be prepared and left the diner offended. I couldn't believe I was dining at a Michelin star restaurant.\n\nOne suggestion... why change the menu everyday? Take what diners love consistently and perfect it. There's too much volatility in the experience. That's a sign...", "author": "Sarah K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-08", "description": "Not my favorite. Came here on a Saturday night, and it was relatively empty, which was sort of confusing. But after trying this place, I could kinda see why. Nico is a pretty modern and spacious restaurant in general, and the emptiness really made the space seem even bigger. Our server explained that the menu was a prix fixe, operating on sort of a \"surprise\" concept, and we could decide whether or not we wanted to see the menu before the meal or not. When we opted to see the menu, because we wanted to know what we were getting, our server seemed visibly annoyed, which was a little surprising (no pun intended), and set a fairly bad tone.\n\nOur meal:\n- Bone marrow madeleine: The madeleines. Oh man, those madeleines. So good and served warm, but unfortunately, they were the highlight of the meal.\n- Oyster with clementine and nasturtium: This was exceedingly bad. It was basically an oyster with orange ice piled on top, which was incredibly off-putting, and the weird textures didn't help at all. I love a good oyster, but dressing it with overwhelming flavors is sort of a travesty to me.\n- Grilled Romanesco with tarragon: Tasty, but the Romanesco could have been slightly more cooked, and was really hard to cut into pieces. The sauces were pretty well-balanced, but in all, the dish was hard to eat.\n- Halibut with salsify, bouillon, and chicory: Halibut was nicely cooked, but was incredibly bland, and the broth it came in was a little too sour. The large leaves, again, made the dish very hard to eat.\n- Entrecote with endive and truffle. The steak was also nicely cooked, but some of us got really fatty pieces with very little meat, and some had no fat at all. The endive was decent, but not enough to save the dish.\n- Chocolate curd with arugula sorbet and fried buckwheat: The chocolate curd was delicious, and the arugula sorbet was actually tasty too, but it didn't make sense to me to be served together. Mixed together, the contrasting flavors made me not want to finish, but if you ate them separately, it was fine.\n- Dessert madeleine: Served warm again, and delicious. Probably the best way they could possibly end the meal.\n\nService was generally attentive with drink and water refills, but our actual server was hard to locate throughout the night, which was frustrating at times. At $65, the prix fixe was, conceptually, very reasonably priced, but since we experienced some poor service and less-than-satisfactory food, I would say that the value wasn't very good at all. The chefs are clearly very technically sound, as evidenced by the preparation and plating, but the overall execution of the flavors just wasn't great.\n\nCan't say I would recommend this place. I realize that the menu changes every day, and that we might have come in on an off-night, but nothing we had really was up to snuff for a Michelin-starred restaurant, except maybe for those madeleines. Honestly, after our experience, they should just open up a madeleine bakery and make a killing. Because they definitely could do that, and I would come back for that.", "author": "Eric J."}

First off it was a beautiful plate with the flowers, I didn't know you could was cherry blossoms! And then there's the flavor. Omg it was so good! The balance of the beets with the fish was just amaze balls. \n\nSecond dish we had some green broccoli-ish veggie. It begins with an \"a\" but I can't remember what it's called. I've never had this veggie before. Looked like a huge broccoli and when it set before us we were kinda bummed. Uh... a veggie is our next dish after our bomb ass yellowtail?? Do not judge a book by its cover, or a veggie by the plate because it was the most scrumptious diddly yummy yumm yumm vegetable ever! My husband who is pretty much thinks any plate without meat is stupid and plain filler, thought that it was amazing and if you could make all non-meat dishes taste that good, we could be vegetarians. \n\nWe had a few other dishes that were good but didn't blow me away as much as the first two. \n\nHowever there was the palate cleanser not on the menu and it was mind blowing. It was a mixture of apples, cilantro and ginger. It was utmost refreshing and delicious.

The ingredients were extremely fresh, and the flavors were thoughtfully composed. It was clearly French inspired dishes with some more modern Asian flavors infused in. \n\nTo start off, we had oysters with a nori cream on the base, mixed in with kiwis. I was more intellectually intrigued by this dish -- I've never had kiwis paired with an oyster than enthralled though. While the oysters tasted good, the cream and the kiwi overpowered the oyster and it ended up just tasting like creamy kiwi. Though tasty, when I have oyster, I want to have some of that oyster flavor. \n\nThe next course was the vegetable course which was pretty enjoyable. It was romaine broccoli grilled with some crispy leaves, cured egg yolk, and a really spectacular sauce base. The sauce really stole the show and let the flavors of the romaine broccoli shine. \n\nThird course was a wonderful veal broth with cured amberjack sashimi with hickory and shitaki mushrooms. I thought the sashimi slices were really generous (huge!) and the fish was extremely fresh. The veal broth was a nice interlude before the main, though I personally found the flavors to be a little too strong for a soup that maybe should have let the fish shine a bit more.\n\nFourth course was the meat course -- a rabbit stuffed with... can't remember what, and a wonderful fresh salad with chervil, which I haven't had since Paris amongst other fresh leaves. I thought the rabbit's execution could have been a bit cleaner -- it was fairly tough, though the red wine sauce with rabbit trimmings paired nicely with the salad and was so reminiscent of traditional French style cooking. This was probably my least favorite dish, though I appreciated the chervil. \n\nThere was an interesting palate cleanser after this. I don't remember the fruit, maybe kiwi? and parsley in ice form, which was oddly refreshing and tasty. But there was also a sweetened gin base that was ab it too aggressive for me, but certainly did refresh the palate.\n\nThe final course was a simple dessert course of a nice pudding textured dish with crumble, almond flavors, and pomegranate. A fine dessert, though nothing outstanding. \n\nThey also started the meal with savory madeleines and ended with sweet ones. Very reminiscent of Manresa, but I enjoyed the gesture nonetheless. \n\nOverall, for $70, this is an outstanding meal. Great portion sizes, attentive and wonderful service, and a thoughtfully crafted menu with clean execution. It seems simple, but you rarely get consistent execution with good flavors in the bay, but Nico pulls it off really well. A wonderful casual meal.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Are they helping us start our 2016 resolutions early, the Atkins way?\n\nI whispered to my friend, \"One last hurrah at Lucky Penny afterwards?\" \n(Hey, don't judge - those fried mozzarella sticks with mystery meat sauce were my everything at 3 am!)\n\nMy friends and I had dinner at Nico in early December to celebrate a dear friend's birthday. Reservations are highly recommended. There's no valet and previous Yelp reviews noted that there was easy street parking but this wasn't the case on the Saturday night we went. We had to circle around several times before finding a space several blocks away on a hill. \n\nThankfully, things got better after the first course but I think your experience at Nico will greatly depend on what blind tasting menu you receive that day. If you don't like, say olives or veal, you're SOL if it's on the menu that day. There are no substitutions unless you have a food allergy. You have an option to see the menu before being served but it's essentially a 5-Course Blind Tasting Menu ($65). It felt like an abbreviated 8-10 course tasting menu but with the same portion sizes. Each course ranged from 2 to 5 bites so you may leave hungry. They do offer complimentary bread so do take advantage of that.\n\nB L I N D  T A S T I N G  M E N U ($65, +$55 for wine pairing)\n(1) Cauliflower floret gribiche, uni, chervil: Hard, cold, and not very appetizing. There was no uni flavor. It was like dipping refrigerated cauliflower into fancy animal spread. \n\n(2) Sunchoke, yellowfoot mushrooms, bottarga: http://bit.ly/1RioLDZ\nOur favorite course of the night, the \"soup\" was velvety smooth, earthy, and complex. Loved the crunchy sunchokes for a textural contrast. My only gripe was there was only 2 spoonfuls worth and we were all left wanting more.\n\n(3) Red snapper, piracicaba, brussel sprouts, meyer lemon: http://bit.ly/1IZ3X1T\nIf you know me, than you know that I hate cooked fish because very few places can prepare it properly (medium rare w/ crispy skin). However, the red snapper at Nico was cooked medium rare so it was delicately moist and tender. \n\n(4) Duck, celery root, apple, mustard greens: http://bit.ly/1Q0vyRu\nThe duck breast was beautifully cooked and rendered perfectly so you get a nice, crisp skin along with tender meat. I didn't care for the roulade of duck confit because it tasted like deli ham. \n\n(5) Squash, chestnut, tangerine: http://bit.ly/1OmOTIa\nThe dessert didn't sound appetizing on paper (I requested to view the menu before service began) but I was pleasantly surprised by the trio. It was on the savory sweet side so that punch of juicy tangerines really brightened things up! \n\nThe parting sea salt caramels were phucking delicious and were almost as good as the ones at Manresa: http://bit.ly/1JFQbBc. I guess that's no surprise since the chef came from Manresa.\n\nWe opted out of the $55 wine pairing and decided to order booze by the glass (beer, wine and loophole cocktails only). Four of the six of us didn't like our drinks. My first drink was a Fall Spiced Sangria w/ persimmon, baking spices, and vanilla ($11). It sounded great on paper but it was nothing more than a half glass of icy, watered down apple juice. I ordered a glass of red next (forgot the name) and it was like French kissing an ash tray. It was grossly smoky so I gave it to my friend's boyfriend to finish. \n\nService was professional, refined, and attentive. The entire staff was really young so it was impressive to see them operate like a well-oiled machine. The tasting menu took a leisurely 2.5 hours. \n\nThe dining room was warm, cozy and understated. Great for a date or a group dinner (no more than 6). I like the open kitchen so you can see the chefs in action. Well light but not too bright so you can snap some good food porn. \n\nIs Nico Michelin-star worthy? \n\nI think that's debatable. While the dishes were gorgeously presented and exhibited well-balanced flavor profiles (except for that cauliflower floret), only one course was remarkable while the others were good but not great. If we received a different blind tasting menu maybe things would have been different? It was good to try Nico once but I'm doubtful I would return...unless I win tomorrow night's Powerball, then dinner for everrrryone!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The kitchen however could use some clocks in there as we waited over 15 minutes between our first and second course. That's where I knocked off a star. \n\nThe food is overall good with beautiful presentation. I would say my least favorite dish was the cauliflower with roe, the roe was just too ocean for me and I love my ocean taste. Dessert was by far my favorite. I would say though, for 5 courses, the price can't be beat. \n\nOverall a good spot to try if you're in the neck of the woods or have a mission to eat at every Michelin like me.

Our mussel dish was lick the bowl on point while we found that the broth for the snapper dish was a bit salty.  I also didn't love the fattiness of the New York strip, but the cut of meat is largely to blame for that but the introduction of the sorrel saved the dish for me.

Husband and I did not opt for the wine pairing but we ordered wine by the half and full glasses. What a nice option for half glass pours!\n\nFOOD\nBread is served with butter. The chef kindly accommodated our few diet restrictions. Small dishes available to order in addition to tasting menu.\n*house cured ham: small dish we ordered as appetizer. Amazing and melts in your mouth. Highly recommended, so good with wine and bread.\n*Steamed shrimp with sea beans, 100 day tomatoes, and cilantro flowers: the tomatoes were bursting with flavor! Shrimp was well prepared, but didn't quite have enough shrimp taste. \n*corn/clam bone marrow broth with corn flower: hmmm very tasty, corn was sweet and broth was salty, it was a nice spring soup that was a cross between corn/clam chowder\n*halibut with squash and vegetable ju: the halibut was very soft, barely cooked (one piece was even a bit raw, but I don't mind it since I love sashimi). The sauce was amazzing\n*lamb with olive tapenade and figs: the lamb was cooked medium rare, cut so thinly and melts in your mouth. The fig were a tiny bit not-ripe-enough\n*basil sorbet with blackberries/huckleberries, chocolate and mint: my favorite of the night and I wished I had double portions of it! I was so surprised that the chocolate was not too rich/sweet and it worked so well with the berries and basil sorbet. Wow!\n\nSERVICE/STAFF\nWaitress was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu and providing recommendations. Service was a bit slow in between dishes, but we weren't super hungry, so was not bothered by it. My bread plate was never empty Bc the staff always came by to ask me if I wanted more right when I finished my piece. I had three slices!

We heard through a friend that it was one of his favorite new restaurants in SF. We bookmarked it on Yelp, and earlier this month we finally got to give it a try! After booking the reservation, we couldn't wait! \n\nEntering the restaurant you're greeted with a huge open window leading into the kitchen, and we were seated right by the action! Our waitress and one of the managers greeted us and wished me a happy birthday. They even left a card on the table wishing me a happy birthday and thanking me for celebrating with them. It's the personal touches that really go a long way! \n\nThe food is indescribable. Every single plate that was brought before us put a smile on our face and warmth to our tummies. Everything was THAT good! Our favorite was the black cod with eggplant, tomato, and marrow broth. My husband even said that it was the best fish he's ever had, and this is coming from a man who doesn't even care for fish very much! The black cod was cooked to perfection, flaky, and melted in your mouth. \n\nSince it was my birthday I got the wine pairing, which is and isn't worth the money. If you're a big wino, do it, if not, you won't be upset if you decided to skip it. I would've appreciated more local wines but instead there were a lot of wines from Europe.

One friend joked I should put that on Yelp, so here it is (thanks Sara!).\n\nMy friends and I were celebrating a birthday there, with one friend having been there multiple times and the rest of us visiting for the first time.  From the moment we walked in the door to when we left, we were treated very well and the birthday girl completely enjoyed herself.\n\nThere is one menu per evening and you have the open of going with the suggested 5 course tasting or selecting a 3 course option from that menu.  The fun part of the experience is choosing not to see the menu and being surprised with each course placed in front of you.  They do ask about preferences and allergies and work to accommodate them.  The menu changes daily and our menu consisted of a starter of lamb, followed by a cauliflower soup, fish, chicken and dessert of strawberries prepared multiple ways.  The dish of lamb tartare initially gave me pause, as I am not a fan of lamb.  However, I decided to just go with what they had and ended up enjoying that dish quite a bit.  \n\nAll dishes are appropriately sized depending on the number of courses chosen. No dish was too heavy or rich, nor did we receive a mostly empty platter of leaves and roots with an occasional speck of protein.  We all felt satisfied at the end of the meal, not hungry and not overly full.  Two of my friends tried the wine pairing, while the rest of us had a glass of wine.  We enjoyed the wines offered and would have had more if we could. \n\nService was friendly and helpful, helping to make the experience very enjoyable and memorable.

I used to scout out Michelin-starred restaurants that had great reviews. I loved the great service and the exquisitely plated food; but I always felt a bit pretentious and shorted with the actual food. The food was good, but never amazing. Since then, I've moved away from this scene because I've grown disappointed by the value of such a meal. But, I decided to give Nico a try with some friends this weekend. Maybe contemporary fine dining had changed and had more to offer? \n\nWe had a late reservation, but were quickly seated to a half-full restaurant. We brought our own wine for this occasion - the corkage fee was $38. We ordered the $65 5-course menu, which changes nightly. Our waitress gave us the option of having the blind tasting without seeing the menu, which we agreed to. The first course was a soft-boiled egg with thinly sliced cauliflower, topped with dill and some other things. This was probably my favorite course as it was very well balanced in flavors and texture. Next, we had a butternut squash soup course. This was topped with a sweet/tangy fruit and sunflower seeds. I've noticed a lot of butternut squash soups topped with sunflower seeds now, but I did like the sweet notes. Our third course was a very tender poached cod with Brussels sprouts. The cod was great, but everything was under-seasoned. Our last meat course was braised beef cheeks covered with chard. Again, the texture of the beef was wonderfully tender, but the dish lacked flavor and I found the chard very difficult to cut as it was draped over the beef cheeks. Our dessert course was a bit fun with multiple different contrasting textures between the over-ripe, but mildly sweet persimmon, the sharply tangy orange sorbet, the light, but cracker-like meringue, and the dusting of bee pollen. \n\nOverall, I found the flavors of Nico to be quite timid and subtle. I had hoped that there would be a progression of bolder flavors as our meal went on. I'm not sure if that's just his style of cooking, the day's offerings at the market, or some of our dietary restrictions that we set aside in advance, but I was disappointed by the lack of aggressive flavors.

I've come twice in the last few weeks (before and after the star being given). \n\nThe first time was much better in terms of food and wine pairing. In both cases it was a 5 course meal where you don't get to pick anything and could choose to be completely surprised by not looking at the menu. The menu changes nearly daily so not much to recommend specifically. I did find the technical skills in cooking the proteins to be superb though as the meat and fish always came out perfectly cooked.\n\nThe service is the most uneven part. Last night, we had a reservation but they kept us waiting (standing as there was no real room to sit and wait) for ~30 minutes past the reservation. 2 people in our party even arrived 15 minutes early so they were standing for 45 minutes. There wasn't really much of an apology other than a quick sorry for keeping you waiting. Most Michelin places would give you complimentary drinks while you wait or desserts (or maybe a seat to wait?).\n\nAlso when we asked to split a wine pairing they just gave us one glass rather than the normal actual splitting into two glasses which makes cheering or toasting a bit awkward.

Right off the bat, this set me off and I was ready to walk out. Not because I didn't want to wait but his loud voice nearly reprimanding us was ridiculous.  But because I was with my family who I don't get spend time with often, I went with it.\n\nAs we were seated, he reminded us several times that we couldn't order for about 20 minutes because the kitchen is timed by seating. Ok....we get it. You only need to tell us once. So we ordered some wine and caught up with each other. By this time it was around 8:45pm and over 20 minutes had passed. A server came by and brought our menus. YAY! We could finally order! WRONG! Within a few minutes, the manager came by and said he wasn't sure who told the server we could order but they were wrong. He reiterated again that we couldn't order yet because of the kitchen timing, collected our menus and our poor server walked away humiliated. WHAT THE F?!\n\nGranted if there was a mistake in the front of the house, there were a dozen ways he could have handled that instead of (1) Humiliating his staff (2) Treating his guests like we were imposing on their time. \n\nIn hindsight I don't know why I didn't encourage all of us to leave at that moment. The wine we ordered was good but not that good to be treated that way. But perhaps we were in shock that this was really happening. \n\nAfter another 20 minutes went by, we were finally allowed to order. Amongst our party, we pretty much ordered a variety of the menu. We had the Trout Rillette, Beets Salad, Lamb Tongue, Endive Salad, Trout with Clams, and Duck. The Trout Rillette was fine. It needed a little more seasoning but the pickled radish added a nice acidic touch. The beets were also ok and the lamb tongue was just a bit gamier for my taste. The trout with clams also had good flavor to it. As for the duck, I was disappointed. The skin was not rendered at all so it was very flaccid and rubbery. However the squash and chanterelles were nicely seasoned. \n\nAfter another bottle of wine (perhaps to wipe out the horrific treatment we had gotten), the manager came by and rather disingenuously apologized for the slow service. It's a soft opening, we expected slow service.  He should have rather apologized for being incredibly rude to us and his server. He then offered to comp us dessert wines if we purchased desserts. How about save the comp drinks and be kind and warm to your guests instead?\n\nI will say that the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant is really beautiful. It's inviting, the wood tables are gorgeous and I love the accent pieces. And the kitchen...STUNNING! It's something I would nearly die to cook in.\n\nAll in all I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. But this was the worst dining service I have ever had and no comp dessert wine will ever make up for it.", "author": "Nam N."}

Places like Rich Table, State Bird, are offering what Chateaubriand in Paris and Relae in Copenhagen are in the area. Add Nico to the mix. Having seen a talk with Daniel Patterson and David Kinch just down the street, we walked into Nico during their soft opening phase. They've gutted a space and built a beautiful dining room and even better looking kitchen. It may look more formal than it really is as the neighborhoods patrons like to be dressed up.

The entire service leading up the the end was amazing.  Shortly after we received our last dessert madeline, we noticed that the manager was collecting our napkins and glasses before we were even done with the dessert. He kept coming back to retrieve things which was a bit annoying seeing that we weren't even done.  We continued enjoying our dessert and conversation until he rudely came and asked us to leave.  I understand if we had our final dessert and continued to stay another hour or so, but the fact we weren't even done and what was worse, my Mom had to walk out of the restaurant with the last madeline due to the abrupt notice, ruined our entire experience.  We were all very upset and felt that the manager was rude and made what a 5 star experience into a 3 star experience (this is being generous).  We also felt embarrassed and extremely shocked that a place of this caliber would have the audacity to do something like this.  Most importantly, my Mom's special night was left ruined and dissatisfied.  We hope that something like this doesn't happen to another customer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-04", "description": "There are two kinds of people in the world - those who want to control their own destiny, and those who want be swept away- by someone, or some force of nature.  I admit, I'm in the first camp, especially as far as dining is concerned.  Only if the chef knows me well am I willing to leave it all in her/his hands.  I don't like rules or contrivances directing my meal.  So, when the waiter explained that the chef's preference is to \"surprise you\", and they only show you the menu if you insist, I found this at best silly at worst irritating.  They offer a 5 course prix fixe with no options at a very reasonable $55or a 3 course prix fixe ($35) where the diner selects any 3 of the 5 courses on that menu.  They also require the whole table to select the same option (3 or 5).  While I understand the pacing can be a bit challenging if not everyone has the same number of courses, since they only offer a total of 5 selections (along with only 3 appetizers), it seems awfully regimented to me.  My annoyance at suppression of the diner's desires was not great enough to detract from enjoying a creative and deliciously prepared meal. \n\nOkay, glad I got that off my chest.  We got the wine pairing as well ($45 for 5; $35 for 3).  We enjoyed all of the rather obscure selections, especially the Arnoux Savigny Les Beaune 2008, served with the veal.  My two little niggling comments here would be:  1. Why no domestic selections?  2.  Why not provide the names of the pours in writing, so we can know what we're enjoying (or not).  On this latter issue, the waiter kindly wrote them all down at my request.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nDungeness crab served with shaved beets and marrow foam.  4 star\n\nWhile in general I'm not a foam fan, in this case it was just the ticket.  I like the idea of marrow, but the texture kind of gags me, so foaming carries the earthy, meaty heft, but avoids the gooiness.  This was avery assertive.  earthy course for a first.  The beets were mostly chiogga's and shaved thinly in their raw state.  I liked the textural contrast.  The crab was fresh and in big enough pieces so you could get a mouthful of that briny sweetness.  I did find a little errant shell, though.  My husband, who \"hates beets\" liked the dish, and refused to believe it had beets in it.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed savoy cabbage, kale puree, pickled kohlrabi and farm fresh egg yolk.  3.5 star\n\nI loved the brassica immersion concept here.  With some little tweaks it could have been a stronger dish.  While lovely to look at, having all the cabbage leaves so large in a liquid base made it difficult to eat without looking like a Cretan.  The combination of the cold puree with the yolk could be a real challenge for the not-very-texturally-adventurous (read my husband).  It needed something with a little more viscosity, too liquidy\n\nBlock cod with chard, romanesco, and Buddha's hand.  3.5\n\nThis was the most visually stunning dish.  The color and textural elements and their composition were very appealing.  I thought it was a little under seasoned.  None of the elements of the dish really asserted itself.  A friend just recently gave me a Buddha's hand.  It smelled lovely and looked wicked.  I think it's kind of gimmicky, though, and couldn't really detect it.  When black cod is poached as it was here, I think it has a bit of sliminess to it.\n\nVeal tenderloin with nettle, sun choke and black trumpet mushrooms.  5 star\n\nWhat can I say?  The veal was done to a perfect rosy pink.  It must have free range, because it had a lovely meaty flavor, and though tender had just the right touch of chew.  The nettle, choke and mushroom  tasted like a forest, in a good way, sweet, umami and  a little tang from the nettles.\n\nMeyer lemon cream, kiwi sorbet, pickled fennel with crunchy meringue.  4 stars\n\nThe pickled fennel was delicious - licorice, tart, crunchy.  It elevated what otherwise would have been a pretty good  dessert.\n\nOverall, the food, service and  intangibles were very good, but  the value was excellent.  Now if they'd just allow me to make my own informed choices.  I will go back though!", "author": "Diane B."}

As our server explained to us, dinning at Nico is \"carte blanche\" which means there isn't a menu and your meal and experience is dependent on what the chef decides to serve you. They won't make any substitutions unless you have allergies. They won't even ask you how you like your steak cooked, because the chef will cook your steak exactly how it should be served: perfectly medium rare. This could be a good or bad thing because your experience greatly depends on what your blind tasting menu will be that day and if you don't like a particular dish, you're stuck with it. \n\nI'm not going to go into the details of the food since the menu changes every day and you can't choose what you eat. Everything I had was outstanding. I do want to tell a story that shows the service at Nico is outstanding. My first course was a beet salad, but I saw other people around me received a scallop dish. I casually asked one of the servers (not my server) why some people got scallops and he replied, \"it's part of the carte blanche menu.\" I just shrugged it off and continued with the rest of my meal. The beet salad was delicious so I didn't care I missed out on the scallop. After I finished my 5th course I was feeling extremely satisfied and ready to walk away happy. Our server came by and gave us a 6th course of dessert with a chocolate stout beer pairing because he thought we were a bit sad we missed out on the scallop and wanted to give us a little treat. I didn't need that extra course of dessert, but the fact that the other server told our server this little conversation blew me away.

This will prevent confusion/whining/bewilderment/peevishness for you and those within your 10 foot radius:\n1.) There is no menu. See below for details as to why this is MARVELOUS.\n2.) There are no vegan or vegetarian options. They call you ahead of time to ask if you have dietary restrictions and to accommodate you, but don't waltz in here thinking there's a soy cheese alternative or fluffy pillows of tofu stacked in the back just for your needs. \n\nYou are currently having one of the following reactions:\n\"No menu?! I thought this was 'MERICA! I demand my freedoms! Where's my musket?!\"\n\"No menu? That's intriguing. I'm sort of picky, though, so I don't know if that will work for me. I might whine and piss off my date.\"\n\"No menu? That's awesome. I love when other people make decisions for me! How exciting!\"\n\"No vegan or vegetarian?! Fascists! Carnivorous conspiracy! Down with the tyranny! Where are my tar and feathers?!\"\n\nThose of the first and last opinions should likely find somewhere else to dine. But let me explain to the others why this is a lovely, freeing, and delicious experience:\nI like my freedoms as much as the next 'Merican. But sometimes choice is exhausting. Because, when it really gets down to it, I DON'T always know what's good for me. That's why my mom had to force-feed me vegetables and convince me that Cinnamon Toast Crunch is not a sufficient substitute for the entire food pyramid. But you know who does know what's good for me? Nico. Because he's an ARTIST. You are commissioning him for a work of art on your table and in your mouth. You wouldn't say to Michelangelo \"I demand you draw me the Baby Jesus in EXACTLY this way! And use these colors only! And do the right product placement of Huggies diapers so we don't have to see Awkward Baby Jesus butt!\"\n\nThere is no menu because Nico is such an artist that he literally creates a different artistic masterpiece--in fact, 5 different masterpieces, as there is a 5-course menu--every single day. He goes to the market and finds whatever is fresh and seasonal and delicious, and his genius mind starts putting all the ingredients together like some kind of magical, culinary Tetrus where they all fall perfectly into place. Then he zips up to the roof garden of his establishment and selects the choicest herbs that are growing there to add flavor and garnish. The fresh sorrel or parsley or oregano on your plate? It was just picked. It was literally growing fresh and wild in the San Francisco moonlight just MOMENTS before you put it in your mouth. \n\nEvery plate is beautiful: somehow the Kitchen knows exactly how to float the fish on the emerald green pond of sorrel puree, how to nestle an egg within the soft, cupped leaves of a cabbage, how to array succulent pieces of chicken around a forest of roasted mushrooms....and the art is in every bite, too. My advice would be to try a bit of everything on the plate in every bite--the flavors are all there to complement one another, and do so in a very unique, delicious way. I highly recommend the wine pairings, too--each glass was perfectly chosen, and each sip was like an exclamation point at the end of the beautifully constructed sentence of every bite.\n\nShoot--I think I lost a few of you there in the miasma of my own pedantry. Sorry. But consider the kind of food that makes a person wax poetic! If you love the art of food, enjoy a romantic, chic atmosphere, and don't mind exchanging your freedom for some utterly delicious food tyranny, come to Nico.

People that are really picky with the way food is prepared or ingredients should let the waiter know if there is anything you wouldn't like or wouldn't eat.\n\nWe selected the 5 course menu and chose not to review the menu. The first course arrived and it was a lamb tartar, a dish my husband and I would have never ordered on our own. However, the dish was mind-blowingly good and I'm so glad I didn't review the menu before hand. The second dish was a corn gazpacho that was also amazing and explored different flavor combinations that were really interesting. The third dish was steamed salmon which we were also blown away by. The fourth dish was a chicken dish that was just okay. And dessert was a sorbet/meringue dish that was also good.\n\nThe service was impeccable and the price is very reasonable for the food and experience. We will definitely plan to revisit this restaurant.", "author": "Trinh N."}

We got the five course chef's choice. The meals were something out of this world. Perfect size portions and such unique flavors. They may look small at first but you will definitely feel satisfied. I can't even tell which course tasted best. There was not one bad thing I can pointed out. We had the beets appetizer then grilled aspargus, hallibut, a dry aged new york steak and chocolate mouse/avocado ice cream for dessert. Loved it! \nOf course I went there because of the michelin star they got. Well deserved!! Also, because they do not charge for reservations, which is very convenient since I work on call.

Five categories; Bites, Starters, Main, Cheese and Dessert. With 3-4 choice in each category.\n\nEverything we ordered tasted great. However, I do feel some items were priced a bit too high. For example, we got the asparagus starter here. It was 3 spears of asparagus for $13. Granted, it tasted really good but $13 is a bit steep for 3 spears of asparagus. They should have put it in the Bites category and priced it at $9.   \n\nI like that they make their own soda but I wish there were at least two options, not just one.\n\nWhen we ordered coffee, they didn't have stevia or other alternative sweetener options. It also took awhile so we actually finished our dessert before the coffee came out. They comp'ed the coffee automatically at the end. A sign of great service. \n\nService was good but it didn't feel friendly. My only criticism (constructive of course) is to describe the dishes when it's brought to the table. Looking back at the menu didn't help since the menu wasn't descriptive either.\n\nThe chef makes a point to visits each table. I think that was a really nice touch.\n\nThe place is small but it doesn't feel tight. Tables were spaced out well compared to many SF restaurants.\n\nNico reminds me a lot of Frances.

On a deliciousness scale I'd give the squid starter a 3.5 and the duck a 4.25. Portions overall were on the lighter side, so adding an extra starter might be a wise decision.

The decor is very pleasant - smaller, more intimate space with a \"less is more\" feel. I enjoyed the soft lighting and appreciated that despite being a smaller space, the restaurant didn't feel overcrowded (sort of like Cotogna). \n\nI enjoyed the soup, chicken dish and the desserts (chocolate cake and glazed pear dish) were delicious. Also, I ordered a cocktail drink which was so interesting - I forgot the name of it so I'll just describe it - Nico fills up about 25% of a small drink glass with this cocktail and you think, \"Wow, $12 for this?\" I believe it was some orange flavored drink. Anyway, it turned out to be really good and I ended up not minded such a small amount of it. If your goal is to get drunk though, this drink is an expensive way to achieve your goal...there are probably cheaper routes. \n\nAll in all, the experience was good. The manager was nice and came up to my table several times to explain the menu. The only problem is that my husband likes a simple salad, filet and french fries. (Why did I take him?!) The menu at Nico is very specific - they don't even serve Coca Cola, instead, they make their own soda which tastes ok. So, if you're not a big foodie and prefer the simple foods in life, maybe Nico isn't the best choice for you. It was an experience and I enjoy new experiences.

But there's no choice -it's a set menu. Even that might be OK if you knew in advance what it was going to be. But since this is San Francisco and you have to reserve well in advance, you never know what you're actually going to get until you're there and it's too late to go anywhere else if you don't like it. \n\nI don't think I need to describe the food because you won't be eating the same thing anyway. I'll just say that in our case, out of 5 courses, we enjoyed about 2 (though still nothing really amazing), another two were just OK (but definitely not something that we'd order if we had a choice), and a fifth we didn't like at all.

But my friend and I both agreed that the service was on the higher standard side, so they've improved their service tremendously.\n\nI got there early and had time to capture the interior.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, from the pendant lights to the entry ceiling tiles to the seats.  The restaurant spent times to decide on how to put every details together and to create a relax, contemporary and comfortable atmosphere. \n\nNot to mention another memorable moment, we're delighted that Chef Nicolas Delaroque came out to greet us.

A friend and I visited without knowing what to expect, and we were simply blown away.\n\nWe followed the 5-course, $55 per-person format, and were told that the menu changes daily. My companion was vegetarian, which was no problem at all according to our server.\n\nOne bite in, and we knew we were in for something special. The first two courses highlighted seasonal produce in a properly inventive manner, combining delicious asparagus and peas with a multitude of foams, creams, garnishes, and more. We couldn't believe how simple, yet flavorful, each dish was.\n\nThe next two courses were seafood and meat respectively - in our case, fish and lamb plates that were stunning all the way through. More striking, however, was the attention to detail given to my companion's vegetarian meal. Belgian endives, artichoke, and even fiddleheads (!) substituted for her proteins, yet appeared nowhere on my plates. Both of our meals were uniquely memorable, a testament to the kitchen's inventiveness.\n\nFinally, the dessert was perfect, a combination of fresh strawberries, black lime ice cream, chocolate mousse, and rich pastry.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, though pricey. We felt our half-glass pours ($7/7.5) were sufficient, but your mileage may very. More interesting were the \"low alcohol\" cocktails, including a spiced white sangria that was delicious and refreshing ($11).\n\nIf I would change anything, I would add an amuse or two before the courses begin, and charge a bit less for drinks ($6 house soda and $5 coffee are a little absurd).\n\nNico has received some sizable accolades lately, and deservedly so, but eating here felt like discovering a true hidden gem. SF has a tendency of overhyping and overrating its trendiest restaurants, yet Nico felt like an escape from that. Throughout the entire meal we felt cared for, and pleasant surprises were abound.\n\nAt one point we noticed a copy of Larousse Gastronomique hidden in the corner, a nod to Chef Delaroque's early training in Paris. While the food here is not particularly French, it embodies the spirit of French cuisine at its finest: the best ingredients, cooked meticulously, and served beautifully.", "author": "Aaron J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "This place is a pretentious rip-off. \n\nMy wife and I got a late reservation on Valentine's Day and jumped on it based on a previous review I had read about Nico. I was not told until we sat down that on this night they had a fixed-price menu for $85 a person. At that point we did not have much of a choice but to stay, and figured this would be an expensive but special dinner. \n\nWell, kind of. The six-course meal of small (sometimes tiny) plates was creative and the ingredients were all very fresh, though the meal itself was not fulfilling at all. The chef is clearly into aerating, so some of the plates came with foamy sauces. As a result, you're eating a lot of air. The two little slices of artichoke each of us had arrived with one of the foamy sauces and were quite delectable, but left you wanting for more. Only the duck as the final dish ahead of the dessert was in any way satisfying, and by that point you were a good two hours into your meal. \n\nBut what really galled me was the way they rip you off with the wine, which was mediocre at best. The menu shows prices for half a glass and a full glass, but there's nothing stating how many ounces each one is, and the pour is left entirely up to the server. At one point my wife got a tiny pour of Chardonnay and when I asked the server if that was the half serving, she said it was a full one. When I questioned that she said the glass was big, enough to hold a full bottle, which was blatantly untrue. We were charged $16 for those 4 ounces or so of Chardonnay. \n\nWith a tip of just above 15 percent, we wound up paying $300 for a very unsatisfying dinner that made me feel like we had been taken to the cleaners. Not only would I never return to Nico, but I would steer any of my friends away from it. Maybe some enemies as well.", "author": "Jorge O."}

With the now de rigeur reclaimed wood tables and yet another \"farm-to-table\" menu, the establishment should revert to selling French country fabrics.\n\nWith hard floors and flat hard ceilings amplifying the ambient noise, the dining room at Nico is not the place for a quiet conversation.  When a member of the wait staff finally appears, diners need to strain to hear the short descriptions of the offerings before the server abruptly vanishes from sight.\n\nThe menu is painfully brief, listing only three \"bites,\" four appetizers, and four main courses; woe to patrons who prefer more choices.  At Nico, the menu is not the only thing that is small: across the board, portions were minuscule and prices high.\n\nThe salsify soup with chicory and (loads of) brown butter ($11) is delicious, but should come with a government fat content warning and perhaps a defibrillator. (Note to chef Nicholas: with that much butter, my shoe would taste good.). Lightly steamed and still crisp, the asparagus ($13) is served with delicate threads of seaweed and the smallest dollop of sabayon.  For the price, one would expect more than two spears.  Cooked perfectly, the juicy pork loin ($24) is accompanied by sun choke and braised Brussels sprouts.\n\nAll in all, chef Nicholas does a fine job; it's the front of the house where Nico breaks down.  Service is glacially slow. After being seated, diners wait ten plus minutes for menus.  Empty Champagne flutes appear on the table and wait at least five minutes for their bubbly contents. After asking if patrons were ready to order, the sever disappeared for what seemed like an eternity. Wine ordered to accompany the main course did not arrive until well after the entree was finished. After asking for \"just a second\" to debate ordering a cheese course, the wait person busied herself across the room for at least ten minutes.\n\nNico is beer and wine only; there is no full bar.  The selection of wines by the glass is tiny and over priced (notice a trend here?), but the bottle list is much better.\n\nWith such potential in the kitchen it's shame that Nico is ruined by front of the house amateurism.", "author": "CJ G."}

Safe place to take the less adventurous eaters while still having a fine dining modernist experience. While it's billed as French it's more modern European and American cuisine with French technique.\n\nLonger Review:\nThe menu offered here is a five course prix fixe for $55 or a 3 course for $45 a good deal for the amount of food, the quality of food and lower than comparable meal in SF. Dinner for two will be at least 120 and more if you get drinks or one of the starter snacks.\n\nFood: The French Spouse considered most of the food 3 stars except for the dessert which I thought the cod dish was also 4 stars. The FS is pescatarian and they were able to accommodate here although for the one land creature course they just gave her some charred greens  instead of the pork. It would have been much better if they had a dedicated vegetarian or pescatarian alternative for the course if they are going to have only a prix fixe.\n\nCourses:\n1. snack of 4 oysters $8- they came with a mignonette covering the oysters in the shell. Good oysters but overpowered by the mignonette.\n\n2. scallops with citrus and sesame- this set the tone for the flavours of the meal with very delicate flavours and subtle touches. Also small artistically plated dishes. When the ingredients were combined it was a nice crudo with the acid marrying well with the creamy fatty scallops. The scallops were served raw which may be an issue for some less adventurous folks.\n\n3. mushrooms dish, this was a composed salad type dish with dots of various sauces and reductions. It was forgettable\n\n4. Black Cod, this was dish where the sum was much better than the components. The cod was poached and had great texture but was mild in flavour but when combined with the smoky puree under it was truly one of the best bites of the night.\n\n5. Pork medallions-sadly the FS got basically this dish without the pork medallions and while the roasted sunchokes were nice they were not a full dish. I loved that the pork was cooked med-rare and was buttery smooth.\n\n6. The dessert was wonderful-five stars and even more impressive was made by the chef not a pastry chef. It was a composed dessert of a light mousse, some crisp merinique, kiwi fruits, buddha's hand which is so the fruit of 2015 and various other tasty parts. It reminded me of a floating island which is making a comeback and was refreshing with strong beautiful flavours.\n\nService- the service was excellent, really really good, our server was friendly and attentive without being omnipresent. The hostess was also friendly and they were able to seat us on time for our reservation even with a full house on a Friday. The service was very professional with them setting up for each course without interrupting our conversation and the food came out at just the right pace. The chef came out and greeted each table which I think is always thoughtful.\n\nDecor-It's modern take on French style-age wood tables instead of white linen, a tin ceiling in the bar area. The is a lot of noise and no sound dampening in sight. We could still have a conversation sitting next to each other and the servers were all good at making sure I could hear everything.\n\nThe place is fully wheelchair accessible. Parking was very easy with us getting a spot right in front of the restaurant perhaps a fluke?\n\nAll in all it was an excellent meal but I don't know that it was memorable enough to go back.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

It was very sophisticated without being opulent. I loved the light fixtures and the color scheme. Also, I loved being able to watch the chefs working.\n\nDINERS:\nBusiness casual people. It's a bistro, but it's not quite the place where you walk in with t-shirt and shorts on. \n\nFOOD:\nThe menu consists of 5 courses (bites, starters, entrees, cheeses & desserts) which you can choose and mix how you want them. (No prie-fixe). The sommelier has picked wine parings for each dish.\n\nCroquettes w/ salsify & sea weed : \nVery tasty. The outside was crispy and the inside was moist and flavorful. I loved the sea weed sprinkled on the top.\n\nAsparagus w/ clementine and others : \nI haven't seen such big asparaguses in a long time. I thought the dish was delightfully done with many details and subtle flavors infused together.\n\nLamb Tongue w/ sunchokes & potatoes : \nI love lamb tongue, I thought the tongue was very delicate and flavorful. Other ingredients were perfectly cooked and complemented the protein very well.\n\nDuck : \nThe duck was perfectly cooked, it was so delicious. I wish they gave us more slices, but the ones we had were quite enjoyable. It was succulent and savory.\n\nNettle w/ fried egg and others :\nI really should pay more attention to all the ingredients.. or take a picture of the menu. This was a great dish that I enjoyed thoroughly. I wasn't crazy about this dish especially compared to the duck which was served at the same time.\n\nCitrus w/ honey ice cream :\nThis was delightful. I was hesitant to order something tart, but the honey ice cream balanced the whole dish so perfectly.\n\nI thought it was very nice that the chef Nico came up to us to ask how the dishes were.. well, he is a very good looking guy with an accent.\n\nVERDICT:\nI thought every dish was very well executed, but I didn't get the wow factors from the dishes.

Service was outstanding and the food was good. \n\nI'm always baffled by the folks in San Francisco based on the reviews some of you post. Some of you shouldn't go out to eat. Maybe it's best that some of you go to the grocery store, get the ingrediants, and teach yourself to cook.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-03-17", "description": "I'm not a fan of giving one star for a review and I don't do it often.  But when I have to think about if this was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant of this caliber, then one star it is because I can't think of a worse experience.  \n\nLet's start:\n\n- We arrived on time for our reservation but still had to wait 15-20 minutes before we got seated.  During this wait, I see a Vince Vaughn-esque waiter with heavy dark bags under his eyes walk ino to the restaurant in a huff.  Odd.  All night he was running around, but didn't seem to be doing much.\n\n- Once seated, Vince Vaughn-eque waiter starts explaining the menu, but was none too coherent and he ends by explaining how they are a big team.  Odd again. But, ummm... okay.  Then he is gone and does not return, perhaps he thought other members of the team would pick up the slack.  We had to flag someone to take our order.\n\n- We also had to flag a server down because our wines failed to arrive with our entree. She came back and put our wine glasses down and one of our glasses had water dripping all over still.  Really? You couldn't take the 10 seconds to wipe it down? Would it have bothered me if this was a restaurant like Chilli's, or some diner, etc.? No.  But you are presenting yourself as a higher end restaurant, then perform like one.  I was actually about to snap a pic of the wet wine glass when....\n\n- Malcom swoops in and just pours the wine and doesn't apologize for the wet wine glass, doesn't replace it but says the wines will be on us due to the wait.  Was it? No.  They charged us anyway.  So much for the team work and communicating to your staff about not charging us.  Sloppy.\n\n- We tried six items on the very small menu.  Having a small menu is a plus in my eyes because the kitchen can have better focus and make each of the items well.  Nope not in this case, of the six only one was truly delicious and that was the soup, sadly.  Some of our dishes were missing portions that were listed on the menu, like no polenta with the asparagus and no candied rhubarb in our dessert.   To me, the food was underwhelming and under seasoned.  Not to mention our entrees were on the cool side when it came to us.  Huge pet peeve!  And amateurish.  Sloppy again.\n\n- At the end of the meal, a server comes and says has anyone come to explain the cheese and dessert offerings.  No, but shouldn't you know this already?  Was I at IHOP where they might say has anyone come and talk to you yet?  Are the team members not talking to each other?  It appears so.\n\nSome times restaurants will have one or the other, good service and maybe meh food or vice versa.  It goes without saying, one always hopes to have a good experience on both sides of the equation.  But when it fails to deliver good service and good food, it's annoying and disappointing.  Poor leadership in the front and in the back of the house.  You might think why didn't you say something to the manager?  Because we were over it and I was too cranky and my girlfriend was too nice and kind and didn't want to make things worse than it already was.  Honestly, with a FOH manager like that, our words would have just fallen on deaf ears.", "author": "ML .."}

I think people are confusing this with Chili's or something. You should be comparing it to the top restaurants in SF (Michael Bauer has it in his top 50). \n\nFor an upscale restaurant, portions are more than solid. We had starters & mains each and was more than enough food. \n\nOk, with that out of the way, onto the food. Seriously inventive and amazing flavors. Great presentation and unique additions. Like the fig leather on top of my duck. Or the fava bean entree my buddy had (who was shocked a veggie dish could be so filling). And finally DO NOT skip desert.

My Lamb basically looked and tasted raw. It was tough to chew due to the lack of firmness of being undercooked and the amount of grizzle in it.

Clearly a kitchen already accustomed to serving at high volume and at times perhaps flowing a bit too fast it was with a slice of warm Manresa-esque bread and a lovely muddled-fruit cocktail that I began and moving next to a duo of appetizers the fried chickpeas with squash puree would prove light and crisp while terrine was coarse, rich, and complimented just enough to tame the expected mineral funk.  Moving next to the night's lone vegetarian entr\u00e9e, a slightly overpriced $22 plate of creamy egg yolk melding crisp potatoes and tender mushrooms I was soon onward to dessert and with the clock ticking just past 6:30 my smile beamed bright, first at the intense sweetness of golden apricots over a toothsome cake seemingly made of nothing but ground pistachios and a bit of butter and then to a boozy mountain of cherries reined in by tangy ice cream and chunks of spongy cake, a duo from which I'd not be able to determine a favorite when asked by my server who soon delivered the check along with a buttery salted caramel and cheerful thanks for stopping in.", "author": "Michael U."}

The restaurant's resume is amazing - Manresa and Saison?  Yes, Please!  it's also in a neighborhood that could use a few more upscale eating establishments.  The decor is very nice, the wine list is very fair.  In terms of the food, we had the roasted beets which were excellent.  The pork was also fantastic- perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The wait staff wasn't sure what wines were open or what they would cost by the glass.  The table next to ours was getting mouth watering descriptions of each dish and the accompaniments.

I do understand a restaurant and it's staff treating friends and important customers differently, but when there are only four tables being served, the difference is glaring.

It's a place with pleasant food, but everything consists of novel combinations of ingredients such that it makes it hard to have a basis for comparison.  What exactly kind of cuisine is this?  How does this compare to the standard chocolate with avocado dessert?  \n    The menu is fixed with essentially no choice (some substituting was allowed for one of our diners who can't eat one of the ingredients offered),  The meal starts with a bit of affectation in that the waiter will suggest that you are not given a menu in the first place, to let the entire experience \"be  a surprise.\"  We declined this offer and requested the menu (hey, I like some information for my dining experience).  When the menu arrives the second affectation of the evening comes in the form of a menu void of verbs and adjectives, just a list of ingredients in the form of a long string of nouns.  Why print a menu that doesn't really tell you what you will experience in terms of preparation?  Is this the punishment I get for having asked for the menu in the first place, a sort of half of a menu void of meaningful content?\n   A first course of salmon with cheese and berries and a sprinkling of small cut-up greens (the sprinkling of small cut-up greens theme tends to repeat itself across other courses) tasted better than it sounds.  The next course was a pleasant but fairly microscopic portion of squid and other ingredients.  Quite pleasant.  This was followed by halibut with baby bok choy (and some small sprinkled greens).  Once again quite pleasant,  The following course of lamb with mushrooms was flawed in that the lamb was essentially raw.  I have no problems with cooking things minimally, but everyone at our table found it so raw as to be over the top (the French use the term \"blue\" to refer to the rawest of meat preparations, something less cooked than the next level up which is deemed \"bloody,\" this restaurant gives it to you at this bluest of levels).  A dessert of chocolate, avocado, and candied pistachio actually worked fairly well.\n    The dining room is simple but pleasant, the service is attentive and kind once you get past the affectations in the whole menu disclosure process.  \n   $500 (with tip) for a dinner for four with splitting the wine pairings.  Not cheap.  Was the food good, well yes.  Was it \"fun\"?  Not really, as it all comes across as a bit pretentious and hard to evaluate. The absolutely fixed menu puts the restaurant in the position of power (not to mention the issues of increased profits as a result of minimal waste, limited need for breadth, and it should be mentioned that the price of dining here will go up about $7 per person soon), not the diner (part of the excitement in a restaurant comes from breadth within a course being served, sampling the food of friends).  Frankly, as this price point there are places that I enjoy more (think Cotogna), have some \"fun\", give me some excitement of breadth, and lack the affectations at about 30% less cost.  All in all it's just too damn \"fussy\".", "author": "William F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-22", "description": "Review update: The restaurant did get back to me, just now.  They stated that they hadn't responded because they were checking with everyone they could contact whether anyone else had gotten sick (no one).  I really appreciated their reaching out AND their refund of our dinner cost.  That was unexpected, but I really appreciated it as it showed the true generosity of spirit that usually goes with a good, chef-owned restaurant.  I stand by my comments about the meal not coming together, and especially about ambiance and service details, which are always job one for the manager of a restaurant.  I do appreciate the effort that has gone into this neighborhood restaurant, and I hope they can work on the details to excel. So three stars for effort, quality of ingredients, and owner response.\n\nI got food poisoning at Nico last Saturday night.  I started being sick shortly after I got home, and the attacks lasted all night and into the next day.  Yuck.  So I wrote to the restaurant through their website.  I told them very politely that I had been violently ill and that they might want to check their kitchen hygiene.  What was their response?\n\nSilence.  I wrote to them about 48 hours ago and have received not a peep from them. \n\nThen I began to think back over the experience at the restaurant.  I had the feeling that the grown-ups were away and the kids weren't really sure what to do.  That they were trying hard to be a sophisticated restaurant but were just missing it.  \n\nThe dishes were creative, all right, but the elements were not well prepared, and the wait staff didn't do a good job describing the food.  We were told that our asparagus were roasted, but they were not.  I heard another waiter tell a nearby table that they were \"lightly blanched.\"  That was true, but so lightly blanched that they were actually raw and bitter.  The anchovy creme didn't go with the asparagus and the flavors didn't meld.  The pea dish was also inconsistent:  some peas were cooked, some raw; some tender, many very starchy.  The sauce was odd and sour.\n\nIn another course, the staff also was not informed or trained right.  They described an ingredient as \"spruce tips, which is a pine.\"  Which it's not, of course.  I tried to get them to clarify what they meant but they were confused.\n\nThe black cod was cooked well, but the big chunks of \"compressed\" Asian pear with it completely overwhelmed the fish.  I cut the pear into tiny bits and that was better, but overall it was clumsy.\n\nThe lamb was raw, really raw.  I love rare lamb, but this was way short of that. \n\nThe dessert had a bout 129 ingredients:  sweet and tasty, but ending up a mishmash of flavors.  \n\nAs for the wine pairings, they were okay, but not stellar, and the pours were very skimpy indeed.\n\nFinally, and this is completely subjective, but I think it explains what was wrong the evening we were there, and why I didn't hear back from them about the food poisoning:  The manager seemed distant and unengaged.  Maybe his dog just died or something, and if so, I'm sorry.  He seemed to be calling it in, not interacting with customers, not training the staff well, not focused on a great wine pairing experience.  And not responding to reports of food poisoning.\n\nToo bad.  I think the chef really wants this to be a good restaurant, but it isn't yet.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

He introduced to us the carte blanc menu, which to me sounded like it would be a chef's whim type of menu.  Because he held onto the printed menus in his hand and didn't share them with us, I assumed that the carte blanche and that menu would be different, but based on the quick sneak I took at it, the printed menu actually is the carte blanc...\n\nBefore the tasting, we started with\n- Oysters: 2 types, very fresh, good champagne mignonette\n- Panisse fries: slightly soft, but the squash puree was sweet and smooth\n- House bread: nice crust, good chew inside\n- Brut rose\n\nThe actual 5 course tasting came with a 5 course wine pairing with generous pours for $45/person.  The first 3 pairings were all French whites.  The courses were:\n1. Fried salsify with candied kumquats and Dungeness crab: The kumquats were sweet yet tart, and the crab was fresh.  The creamy puree in the center was too rich for me, but I liked the foam on the side\n2. Celery root: roasted in a salted clay crust, shaved thin and rolled up.  It was served over black trumpet mushrooms in a beurre monte sauce and chickpeas.  I love celery root, but it's quite dense, and this dish was kind of too big of a portion\n3. Stewed black cod with bergamot sauce romesco and soubise: the black cod was super tender and almost sashimi style\n4. Roasted chicken with carrot puree toasted quinoa and cacao nibs: the chicken breast was extremely tender; the thigh meat was a little undercooked for me.  The carrot puree was well seasoned, and the toasted quinoa added a nice crunch.  The gamay rouge that went with this was just ok, in my opinion.\n5. Eucalyptus granita, rice pudding. and grapefruit: a very nice light refreshing dessert with lots of textures. I liked this a lot.  The sparkling sake with this wasn't amazing but was a good match\n\nThey ended with salted caramels with the check, and the chef came out personally at the end of the night, which was nice. I enjoyed the open view of the kitchen, but pacing was slow.  Also I had to keep asking for refills on my water - the server would refill water at the table next to us and not notice my glass.

I had learned about Nico through friends and when I visited the website it looked like a great spot that wasn't too pricey. Nico (named after the chef) did not disappoint. We went with the 5 course tasting menu which was a creative blend of fresh seasonal vegetables (dishes included asparagus, fennel, fava beans, avocado, pistachios, kumquats, cucumbers...) and perfectly cooked fresh seafood (we had razor clams and cod), a tasty meat dish (lamb) and a well-balanced strawberry and basil gelato dessert. I must emphasize that I enjoyed the dishes because all the ingredients were so fresh and each dish was so creative. There were so many different elements like foams, purees and sauces, but they all worked harmoniously to balance each dish. I went in expecting classic french cuisine but was extremely satisfied with the California style inspired dishes. Even though the food was complex it wasn't pretentious. The wine selection was perfect in that there was not an overwhelming amount of wines to choose from. I tried 2 generous pours of half-glasses of a rose and cab and both were delicious. As for the ambience, it was a nice and cozy space with modern decor and the vibe was very laid back and warm, which I really appreciated.. Like I was eating in the chef's home.

I have to admit, beets aren't traditionally a favorite, but the color on the plate was beautiful with the rich red of the beet and then the bright green of the sorrel.\n-Cauliflower with either a scallop or scallion chip and a cheese sauce(foam?): this was a really elevated, sophisticated presentation of a childhood favorite (cheese & broccoli)\n-Black Cod: I can only describe the fish as melt in your mouth - which sounds weird I know. I can't put my finger on the preparation here, but it was spot on.\n-Chicken: Typically I'd say chicken is a protein that I wouldn't usually choose for a restaurant dish, since I'm super spoiled by home cooking, but the chicken thigh was cooked perfectly in this case, and I was totally impressed.\n-Kiwi: Not overly sweet, this was a great ending to a great meal. The sweet riesling, or maybe viognier also added a nice touch.\n\nWhat really made this a five star meal in my experience was that I had indicated on the OpenTable confirmation that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and I had even called day of to see if they would be able to put a candle in dessert or something along those lines (I wasn't expecting anything over the top - by comparison, last year we went to Kokkari and they spelled Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on our baklava). They assured me that they could bring out a candle at the end of our meal, but due to an oversight on one end or the other, we didn't get that experience (though several other couples dining at the same time did).\n\nI sent an email to the restaurant the next day outlining all of the above (that we LOVED our meal but were just a little disappointed with the experience and our special request being ignored), and the owners sent us a bottle of champagne to apologize and celebrate at home.

Seriously, telling a customer that the food I just waited 1.5 hours for is \"not for everyone\" is not ok.\n\nThen, the manager stated he would remove the rabbit from our bill (thank you), but when the bill came, he was still charging us for it.\n\nThis place does have potential, however, they need to significantly improve the service.", "author": "Chris M."}

We ventured in during the \"soft opening\" and I will sadly never go back. \n\nThe evening began and ended badly mainly due to the loud and obnoxious manager. The very worst part of our experience. He was bombastic, complained to us about another customer and yelled at the bartender. Who I assumed he hired and through her own confession had no bar experiences what-so-ever. She admitted she knew nothing about wine either which besides beer is the only alcohol they serve. He yelled at her when she poured a corked glass of wine and continued berating her throughout the evening. \n\nThe service was exceptionally slow, even for a soft opening. I ordered a sole appetizer, which arrived raw. There was no mention of the fact it was raw on the menu nor had the bartender said anything about it. The entree plates were so hot, we were repeatedly warned not to touch them but the rabbit dish I had ordered, which came on one of those plates was stone cold. The manager took the plate away when I sent it back and never asked if I wanted anything else. We finished our soup which was delicious, paid our bill and left. The manager came running outside after us to apologize, it was so very strange. \n\nThe next day, I encountered a client who asked if I had been to Nico. I in turn asked if she had at which point we couldn't believe that we each shared nearly the same experience, only her's was worse! The manager complained about the help directly to them, as the (male) bartender made faces at the manager behind his back. She said it was like a Saturday Night Live show. Slow service, rude manager and under prepared food. \n\nI really feel for the staff. What an uncomfortable thing to experience while dining. \n\nI will stick with the ever so great Girabaldis for dinner and lunch. Sociale and Spruce too. It's really too bad, not just for the neighborhood but also the owners who seem to be very nice people. Get rid of that manager! It's your only hope.", "author": "Sophie K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-11-14", "description": "I live in the area and decided to try Nico's during it's still soft opening on friday night 11/8.  We went at around 945p so only 1/4 of the tables were filled.  The enthusiasm of the owner and manager and the fact that it was in my neighborhood, made me really want for it to succeed.  I ordered the beet salad followed by the trout entree.  I agree with the other reviewers that the servers didn't really know the dish nor could they explain or answer my questions.  However, they were nice enough.  The food itself I thought was delicious, clean and flavorfull.  The manager and owner/chef were often seen walking around talking to the patrons.  The restaurant itself was beautiful.  In short, I enjoyed myself enough that I suggested to my family/friends who were visiting from out of town to go back the next night (11/9, Sat).  \n\nMy fault for thinking that it might not be busy during it's soft opening, so I didn't call early to reserve a table for 6.  When I did around 6pm, I was told that they didn't have anything until 9pm.   We took it but since we were walking around, decided to swing by around 8pm to see if they had any openings then for drop in.  The restaurant was pretty full compared to the previous night.  \n\nThis is when things went down hill.  I knew that we were early.  We were willing to accept them to say \"No, we can't seat you\".  Instead, I was reprimanded for coming too early by Malcolm, the manager.  He then told us that he didn't want us to be standing around the front of the restaurant, to which we responded that we would move slightly over to the bar for drinks while we wait.  To which he told us that he would go ahead and seat us (apparently there was a table to accomodate us) but couldn't serve us food for another 15-20min.  This was not a problem at all for us since we wanted to have a drink/wine anyway.   I understand that they wanted to control how many dishes are ordered at any given time given the chefs in the kitchen and for quality control.  However, when one of our waiter accidentally gave us a menu about 20 min later, Malcolm came by, VERY upset, rudely chastising his waiter in front of us, telling them that they couldn't serve us yet and that he already said this before!  You can imagine how embarassing this was for the waiter and even more upsetting it was for us.  Were we not paying patrons? Did we not ordered several bottles of expensive wine while we waited? I felt terrible that I had suggested this place.  Again, I understand that the restaurant was very busy and that they had to control the flow of the orders. But if this is how he handles stress (AND at only the beginning of their opening), then I can't imagine how he'll do when the restaurant becomes busier.  \nWe were finally given a menu at our \"deemed\" 9pm.  The dishes were similar to the night before, so I enthusiastically recommended those that I and my friend had the night before.  To my disappointment, the same dish listed came out not only looking completely different then the night before, but MUCH smaller and not as well cooked.  I tried to rationalize that the Chef was probably playing around with the dishes since it's their soft opening; and that he was probably keeing in mind what he had available that day.  However, as much as I wanted to try explain for my experience that night, I just couldn't justify the poor service, and the poor food.  \n\nMalcolm did come by at the end of our meal when the restaurant was half cleared out to apologize  (though not really) and comp us our dessert wine pairing IF we order desserts.  He didn't take ownership for his rudeness to us and his staff.  I agree with some of the other reviewers:  too many good restaurants in this city to dine at one where the experience left you feeling like second rate citizen and the food was inconsistent.  \n\nToo bad.  I think with more experience, Chef Nico will do fine if he can be more consistent.  But Malcolm---- too full of yourself!", "author": "Phooey N."}

The lamb was superb as well, but not as good as the other two. \n\nMake sure you try the white sangria with kumquats.\n\nI may or may not have a shed a tear of gratitude when the chef came out to ask how was the food. \n\nOne annoyance: The round table in the middle was slightly warped causing utensils to slide off the side.", "author": "Timothy Y."}

Five course tasting menu ($55) which changes daily.  We choose to be surprised without viewing the menu...and what a surprise.  The food was fabulous and memorable:  sashimi of snapper with blackberries, celtruce with truffle and hazelnut, king slamon with melon and goat cheese, lamb with eggplant and nectarine with olive oil and blueberries.  The food may sound simple but each course is prepared with their grown herbs and spices (up on the roof) which makes each course unique and tasteful.

This is a wonderful restaurant.  The room is beautiful and perfectly lit.  Unlike many restaurants these days, there was plenty of room between tables, so you weren't sitting in strangers' laps.  The staff is very friendly.  The food was original and extraordinary.  They have a few hiccups to work through:  (1) The waits between courses were long -- very, very long.  We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing.  So what would typically happen is that we'd get the wine for the next course and then wait for half an hour for the food to arrive.  By then we had already worked our way through the wine.  But the food was so good that we would forget the long wait.  (2) We never got bread without asking for it (ever!).  Again, no big deal, and the bread was so good that it was worth begging for.  (3) The only sour note was that all three of us felt that the red wine was corked for one of the courses.  When three people who are admitted wine snobs think so, these voices need to be listened to.  The sommelier disagreed and was more than a bit condescending about it (Us:  \"It smells and tastes like wet newspaper, it's a classic case of a wine being corked.\"  Sommelier:  \"That's the way it's supposed to taste.\"  ..... We all looked at each other and thought:  \"Hmmmmmm .....\").  To his credit, he replaced the wine with new wine that was deliciously un-corked.  Nico is a great restaurant, and we enjoyed ourselves quite a bit.  They have some fine tuning to do, but I'm sure they will work through all of that.  They deservedly get 5 stars!", "author": "Thomas M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-11", "description": "TL;DR - go to Spruce instead.\n\nThis place is terrible, and entirely because of the service. The setup is this: they are focused on wine pairings with food and function on a menu and wine list that changes daily. \n\nShould be great. Here are some examples of why the execution is terrible:\n1) Unlike other novel restaurants (i.e. State Bird, etc), they do not explain their system at all. \n2) They have 3 different menus, but to no explain this in the beginning. Aperitif, Food & wine pairing, wine list. \n3) You do not have a dedicated server. This leads to MASSIVE confusion and being asked several times if you have ordered, what you ordered, etc.\n4) The waitstaff is so focused on trying to remember the daily menu changes, they do not do a good job actually waiting on you.\n5) They push you to have wine at every course (i.e. 4 different kinds of wine), which is both expensive and not really what I want to do every weeknight\n6) They are rude: the maitre'd pulled our friend's purse clean off the back of her chair, could have damaged the purse and pulled her chair. Instead of apologizing, he condescendingly said he would put it on the floor instead.\n\nAll that said, the food is good.

Some of our group liked it better than others.  Those who didn't like it didn't care for the basic ingredient (in this case it was duck).  The criticism wasn't about the preparation.    I think we all felt that all of the courses were quite rich and might have preferred some lighter things interspersed with the richer courses.  Another time, I would look at the menu to decide whether or not to go with all five courses.  I might opt for a vegetarian option.

There is a lightness to the cuisine yet richness in flavor. I loved everything we tried including the dessert. The wine pairing can be by the course and they even offer half portions of the wine. Presentation and service are both outstanding. They explain the wines and don't rush you through the courses. And the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food and service. Nico himself came out to say Hello which was a nice touch. The portions are a bit on the small side however, and I have to admit to feeling a bit hungry a couple of hours later.

Other than a slightly too long lag time between ordering and the first course being served, the food was wonderful. Everything was perfectly fresh, beautifully presented and actually tasted the way it was described to us by our server, a rare treat. The beignets, veggie cheese fritters were to die for. \nI had chicken that actually tasted like chicken. The cheese course with a \ncamembert, a goat and one other was great. \nWine? I'm glad you asked. Malcom Brownson suggested a French merlot, The second label of a highly regarded French producer. Tasty and not an arm and a leg. He obviously knows his wine. Out of curiosity we asked about a Lebanese wine from the Bakkar valley. It seemed like he was intimate terms with each grapevine of the vineyard.

Normally, we would have waited a month or two but, because we live in the neighborhood we had been watching the construction progress for several months and decided to give it an early try. It is a warm, cozy and inviting space with comfortable seating and well-spaced tables and at 630 PM was about three quarters full.  Our party had almost all of the small opening menu options--three of the four starters, three of the four mains and both of the dessert offerings.  Without exception, all of us thought all of the food was fresh, delicious, well executed and nicely presented. The wine list is nicely organized and well-selected and includes some very good values and some interesting wines not found elsewhere. While our table experienced  attentive service, particularly given the newness of the operation, it was obvious that some other tables seemed not to fare so well.  It is my understanding that the general manager is highly experienced and has opened and managed other high end San Francisco restaurants.  As a result, I expect - and hope - that any opening shortcomings will soon be corrected. We look forward to giving Nico another try in a few weeks time and hope that it will become one of our favorite neighborhood standbys.  I am rating this four stars because of the high quality of food, the wine list and the comfortable and inviting space and expect that when the service becomes more settled, a fifth star will be warranted.", "author": "Thomas P."}
