He ordered the belly burger while I chose the 3 piece fish and chips with tartar sauce. \n\nMy dish came with 3 large pieces of fish. However, the fish was covered in a bit too much batter. Seemed like there was more batter than fish at times. While crunchy on the top, the underside of the fish was soggy. The tartar sauce was fine, but I definitely enjoyed the fries! Crispy to perfection. \n\nMy friend told me he generally enjoys the burgers at this joint, but today his belly burger (which came with bacon, cheese, mushrooms, etc) was a bit dry.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant felt a bit rundown, but they had a TV showing a basketball game, which was a plus for the sports fans! There was also a free condiments bar where one could load up and customize the lettuce, onions, and sauces for the burgers. Additionally the staff was very friendly.

Seriously, INCREDIBLE tasting burger with topping perfection that you can add yourself. How much better does it get?? \n\nWho should visit with me?

And they have great topping options too!! And there is no limit to how much you can dress your burger with these toppings!! So it's great! They also have ice cream and root beer floats so yeah, DAMN GOOD! \n\nI'd love it more if: The food is amazing. It would be so cool if this place was just a little more cleaned up, but it adds to the character so I'm not complaining ;) \n\nAmbience/Location: Sort of a low-end decor going on in side, but it's cute. Very SF. The best food is found in the weirdest locations. \n\nService: Awesome. You order at the counter and they cook up your burger perfectly for you. The flow of ordering and pickup isn't really great (kinda clumsy) but it works if it's not crowded in there.  But if anyone is in line you're tripping over them.\n\nTips: Get the bathroom key from the checkout area. \n\nRecommended Dish: All the burgers are incredible.

The cashier asked me what soda I wanted, but I said I just wanted a cup of water to drink. I don't know if the price he gave me was for a combo meal deal (burger, fries, and soda) but now that I calculated it, I guess I was charged for a soda; I don't know why though when I said I didn't want a soda. The total of my avocado cheeseburger and fries was $11.26.\nI don't know how long it took for my burger to come out but it wasn't that long of a wait. When my order was called, I went up to the front to get it. There is also a condiment bar at the front where I added lettuce and got ketchup and mustard for my burger. \nI don't know what it is but this was one of the best burgers I've had.

It was okay. I wish the patty was thicker and juicer. It was slightly dry. I did see a sign after I ordered saying they offer kobe beef for an additional fee, but by that time, it was too late to change my order. I might have enjoyed the burger more had I gotten a kobe patty. The roommate seemed to enjoy his burger with the additional chili and egg. It made it a little more substantial. The condiment bar was fun, but there was only so much I could fit in the takeout container they gave us. The buffalo wings were standard. Meaty, but nothing special. I adore chili cheese fries, but I hate beans. I was happy when I saw the order since it looked like I wouldn't have to pick out any beans. However, after eating the fries, it seemed like the beans were mashed into the chili? It had a beany texture and taste which I didn't like. The garlic fries were good, but they actually resembled seasoned fries more than garlic fries.\n\nAfter we got home, I notice our garlic fries were missing. The roommate left to go get them while I called Belly to let them know they were missing. The lady on the phone didn't seem to believe that I ordered and payed for the garlic fries. She checked her receipt and then confirmed we ordered them, but she still asked that the roomie bring the receipt with him. Since he left without it, I texted him the pic, but I thought that was a little distrustful. We were just there when it was empty and she looked at the receipt while I was on the phone.\n\nEasy to grab takeout since it's on the way home, but I've had better burgers.

I got an avocado burger and my boyfriend got the belly burger. We both loved our meals! Burgers were cooked fresh to order, and they come on a really good bun that didn't get soggy, even after adding a huge pile of toppings from the topping bar! These burgers are really an amazing value- for under $8 you can get a really tasty niman ranch burger and load it with as many topping as you want! Also, these burgers come on mini baking trays which I thought was genius considering how messy a great burger can be! Also, the service was good- everyone was very friendly, and the gentleman ringing us off offered us free water without us even asking! Overall, this place definitely exceeded our expectations and we will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Rachel D."}

You serve your own toppings from a bar which was a little bit novel and added to the experience. It was fun overall.\n\nI did want to say, that I'm not sure why this only has one dollar sign on yelp. I think it should be rated as more expensive. We were hoping to have an inexpensive meal out, and it really became more money than you think. It's true, if you only order one thing, you will be under $10 per plate, but they seemed to nickel and dime everything, a specialty topping was more than a dollar for most of them and they even charge for a little bit of sauce. Burgers don't come with fries, and fries aren't cheap. For a whole meal, this place is definitely more than $ (I think of $ as In-N-Out prices).\n\nLike I said, the food is good, we got the curly fries which were delicious and the meat was definitely high quality, but don't expect a $ total - plan for $$!", "author": "Hanna P."}

None of it was very good, all of it felt like hospital cafeteria quality.  \n\nLook, we live in SF.  We are used to good food.  We expect a higher level of taste and quality than other parts of the country.  If you're not willing to go that extra mile, if you're not willing to compete on the level that this city expects, maybe you should do something other than sell food to people.  Perhaps Electronics or Hardware is more up your alley.\n\nBottom line: I can think of about 10 better places to get burgers off the top of my head, including: Big Mouth Burger on Valencia Street, any of the BurgerMeister locations, Burger Joint (also on Valencia), Pearl's, Roam Artisan Burgers, the list goes on and on.  I would've included Greenburgers on the Lower Haight, but apparently they have closed down.  \n\nIf you can't, at the very least, MATCH what those other burger spots are doing, then don't bother.  Your lack of effort, your DISinterest in making people happy with the food you serve to them, is obvious and makes me think that you should be in a different line of work.", "author": "FoodDudeS F."}

For some reason, none of the places I was looking at in the Outer Richmond part of Clement didn't strike my fancy then; I walked around for a good 15-30 minutes trying to make a decision....\n\nFinally, I gave up on the search for Asian food, and I walked over to Belly Burger. Belly Burger: I'd seen this place plenty of times while sitting on the 38 bus (the bus stop is conveniently located in front of Belly Burger); the name intrigued me, and in general, I just had a burger craving come upon me after my lunchtime search. \n\nThe place was a little quiet for a sunny Sunday afternoon; a basketball game was blaring on the flatscreen television, so it seemed to me like a \"typical\" burger place/sports bar kind of feeling (sans an actual bar). Ironically, the other customers that were eating in that day were women, all women...guys sauntered in later while I was eating, but they didn't stick around long. Interesting.\n\nWell, despite my promise to myself to spend only $7 for my meal, I actually ended up spending $7.74 here, and had to use my card (luckily, Belly Burger accepts card). I went for the \"Mini\" Burger, which was 1/4lb of beef. This was considered a Mini! My impulsiveness also decided a side of fries (a HUGE side of fries) and a diet soda would serve me well for the burger lunch. I probably could have done without the fries, but hey, it was a satisfying meal.\n\nService was as good as counter-service could get for the time being: they rang up my order quickly, and then I waited about 5 minutes for them to toast the burger bun and cook the patty. The burger itself wasn't overly greasy, and sides/condiments were dressed on my own. I don't remember the prices at Fuddrucker's off the top of my head, but I assume the burgers at Belly are priced a little cheaper than Fuddrucker's.\n\nThe restaurant/seating area was relatively clean, none of the tables looked overly messy. Then again, I went while it was still early in the day, so I'm not sure how crazy the place becomes come nightfall. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll ever venture past the Mini Burger option, since it was a good enough size for me. However, I may go back to try one of the other selections, just to see how the thicker patties fare with my system.

So many bites that I didn't finish. \n\nBelly burgers are made of Angus beeef cooked on this big circular grill similar to the one they use at Mo's. Whatever that thing is, it makes super nice grill marks and it cooks my meat good! They don't ask you how you want your patty done, but it's medium by default. And it's a good medium that this medium rare eater here is happy with. \n\nThe buns are buttered and toasted golden. It has a generous meat to burger ratio, which wins a truck of points in my book. It look me a long time to eat this burger, and my bun didn't get soggy.\n\nThe burgers are pretty much naked when you get them, unless you order cheese.

There's alfalfa sprouts, which I love, and pineapple slices--which I have to go back and try.\n\nI think for me, their fries is their weak point. I'm not really a fan of in-between fries, is it steak? or is it skinny? Not sure, but there were loads of it and I think it needs more crunch and flavor. \n\nThere's a big lcd tv here so you won't be bored if you were out on a solo burger fix. I think Belly can also use a few more tables for better ambiance. \n\nSo for now, I am leaving my review as a 4 until I do a back to back visit to Belly again and my favorite burger spot Bill's up the street. Don't worry tho, so far the results are lookin' fine.", "author": "Faffy L."}

That's pretty inexpensive for a lot of food and a soft drink.  The posted weight of the burgers prior to cooking is 7 ounces, and they give you a gigantic order of fries to go with it.  You have your choice of cheese too.  I went with the Pepper Jack.  My burger and fries were ready in a little more than five minutes.  With lots of toppings to choose from ... I had alfalfa sprouts, fresh mushrooms, leaf lettuce and sliced tomato.  The burger was cooked a bit well; I would have preferred the meat just a tad redder, but this was an excellent burger.  There were so many fries I ended up wasting some.  \n\nThe lady who takes the orders and brings you your food was quite friendly.

Nothing to write home about, but they were big enough that you could taste the potato (I'm not a fan of shoestrings) and cooked perfectly.  \n\nThe add-your-own toppings thing is cool in theory, but this place is a little lacking in execution.  I say this because I just felt awkward all around when we chose to eat in the outdoor patio area.  We went back there and Gramma shuffled the kids out of sight (I'm guessing family, this place has to be family-owned) so I felt like I ruined the kids' play time.  Then when our burgers were brought out to us, we had to take them back inside to put condiments on them...and there's no table to set your plate down on whilst gathering your condiments.\n\nThe burger; however, makes up for all of that.  Had a tiny bit of char taste (in a good way) to it and the avocado was just the correct amount of ripe-ness :)   \n\nGo to Belly and give them your money, because I'd like to see this place hang around (this is the 3rd business that's been in that spot since I moved here 2 years ago).", "author": "Courtney N."}

Specifically, it is extremely rare for me now to think about ordering a burger that didn't come from a free range and grass-fed cow free of antibiotics and full of smug.  Alright, maybe not all of that, but my point is my standards have gone up a bit in this regard.\n\nUnfortunately there are few places that do this, at least for a reasonable price.  Luckily, Belly Burger is one of them, and even more luckily, I live nearby.  \n\nThe burger itself is fairly hefty, though you can also get a not-quite-as-hefty 4oz version for slightly less money.  I generally get mine with pepper jack and sometimes bacon (I never said I was perfect, and nope, not giving up the bacon) and avocado.  Grilled onions are also an option.  The cold toppings are available from a bar of sorts, including several types and cuts of lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, pineapples and beets...yeah, I don't bother with the beets or pineapples, but some people like them because they're still there.  \n\nI'm not a big fan of the bun - for whatever reason, the bun falls apart too easily.  Not so much that it's a huge mess by the time you're done eating the burger, but enough to be slightly annoying.  The fries haven't left any particular impression on me, and I thought the onion rings were pretty average myself, although it's been awhile since I've tried them so maybe they've improved.  The owner is a really good guy, very friendly, and he does try to make people feel welcome and stay awhile.\n\nThe burger itself is a 3.5 due to the bun thing and the non-burger dishes are only so-so, but between the guilt-free status of the burger, the friendly local vibe and the price, this place deserves a solid 4 overall.", "author": "Sus...

Both were pretty well done. Not burnt, but had no trace of pink. \nI prefer my burger truly medium (or med/rare.) If you don't know what that is, go to cooking school and learn. It's important. \n\nThis meat doesn't have enough fat content to be cooked this much. When I make my own (or meatballs, or anything of this sort) I go to a good butcher (Whole Foods is decent) and get the ground chuck. \nIt has the best flavor and a respectable fat content. If you're gonna do it - do it right. I appreciate that they serve natural Angus. \n\nBun: basic seedless, white bun. Lightly toasted. (not enough) \nMeat-to-bun ratio: perfect? - almost too much beef (I prefer 1/4#, this is 1/3) but the meat is evenly shaped and reaches the end of the bun \n\nRings: terrific. Thick, juicy slices of sweet onion with a paper-thin tempura batter. I like mine cooked just a bit longer (coating), but they really were wonderful. I smashed one into my burger to up the fat factor. \n\nCheese: I was given American, which I don't hate, but would prefer Jack in this case. Not sure if they have a choice. The guy didn't give me one. \n\nCondiments: Considerate assortment of both leaf and chopped lettuce, white and red raw onion rings + chopped red, thinly sliced tomato (yay! hate thick), sprouts, carrots, black olives, garbanzo and kidney beans, relish. And in pumps or bottles: ketchup, mayo, yellow and deli mustard. \n\nPackaging: I could do without the plastic clamshell. I appreciate my burger being protected for the trip home, but c'mon now. Wake up and smell the landfill. \n\nCleanliness: The place looked very clean and well-kept. The bathroom was also very clean. I was a bit put off when a customer came in with his (small, but still...) dog and actually ate there with the dog in the restaurant. The owner didn't bat an eyelash. The man was not blind or impaired in any way I could see (other than being selfish and rude.) \nI love dogs, but not in restaurants or stores while I'm shopping.", "author": "Blue R."}

I had fish and chips which were great but I regretted out of guilt about eating fish. Everyone else had a cheese burger and fries. They all said the burgers were great. I can attest to the fries being A-1. So you may be asking why not a four star rating. \n  Well the place was freezing inside, I had to go back to the car to get extra warm gear so I could eat. We had three kids with us and they wanted their coats. The tables and chairs all needed a good wipe down and the floor needed to be picked up. It wasn't busy so I'm not sure what the deal was about cleaning. It was also very pricey for burgers. I would have a hard time spending that much here again. They need to add a kid burger to the menu.", "author": "Stella N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-06", "description": "Here's the deal -- If you've read my previous reviews (of course you haven't), you'll know I have a thing about fries. To wit: a french fry is a piece of a waxy potato, otherwise unadulterated, that is cut into a straight strip and deep-fried in oil. It is not coated, reconstituted, pre-spiced, curled or fucked with in any way beforehand. If you want to add stuff afterwards - be it ketchup, mayo, vinegar, cheese, gravy - hey, that's your kink...do it up. But when it gets to your plate, it's virginal.\n\nSo...the fries at this place (10 days old and I'm still reviewer #2...the power of Yelp!) are ideal. And as the reviewer before me mentioned, you get a ton with the combo. If you eat in-house, your combo comes on a plastic tray (Yes, with a wax paper tray liner, relax) and any room not filled with burger is generally filled with fries.\n\nThe burger is also excellent. Again, in reference to the first reviewer, i did ask for medium rare and got it that way. It's pretty big too, and you get to pick your own toppings at the toppings' bar' or whatever it's called.\n\nThey also toast and butter the bun. This is crucial to keeping a juicy burger this big together for the whole meal. Good work!\n\nThere were other things on the menu (salads etc) but I can't vouch for them. Use the maxim that says, when determining what to order at a particular restaurant, \"order whatever's on the biggest neon sign.\" In this case, that means \"burger\". \n\nAlso, on the first reviewer's subject of what this place was before...when I moved to the Richmond 2 years ago, it was the saddest Arby's in the world. I ate there twice -- the first time because I loved Arby's as a kid, the second time to see if the place was nearly as bad on a return visit as it was the first time. It was...loud, migraine-inducing dance music in the afternoon coupled with having  every friggin' door open, making it the coldest restaurant I've ever eaten at.\n\nThen it became a Korean BBQ place I think (besides sushi, another restaurant concept that, you know, there's just so little of in the Richmond). No word on how cold it was then.\n\nBut I noticed at Belly Burger, it was chilly still. Is there some kind of ventilation problem here that they need to keep the doors open? That's what cost them the Yelp star in my review...\n\nAnd be prepared to wait -- it ain't MacD's. It'll take 8-10 minutes to get you that order the way you like. Chill out (not a joke, but kinda yes, a joke) and think about what you'll want on your fries...", "author": "T C."}

The place just opened up a few months ago and I'm a loyal fan and avid customer already so must defend the last few reviews. I myself am quite the burger aficionado and cheap food foodie. \n\nThe burgers are AMAZING and cooked just the way I like it (medium) everytime over volcanic rocks. I think that in and of itself is enough to make this burger joint the coolest. My favorite is the avocado burger with American cheese (Swiss is gross dude). The buns come toasted with butter and the beef is juicy, flavorful and ginormous. For less than $10, I get a huge Arnold Palmer (half lemonade, half ice tea), golden fries and the avo-burger. I highly recommend adding the sauteed mushrooms-- the ten minute wait is worth the wait. \n\nHave tried other items on the menu but can't comment much for the salads. The chili cheese fries are HUGE and must be shared with 3+ persons or you may go home feeling guilty/fat. \n\nThe milk shakes (chocolate is my favorite) are made with real, all natural Breyer's icecream. Incredibly thick (must ask for spoon) and in my personal opinion, is also worth the wait. \n\nNote to self, Belly's is not a fast food joint to be confused with Sliders or McDonalds... it's a family owned, burger aficionado's restaurant and good things are... yes my friends, worth the wait. \n\nI'm a big fan of any place family owned (yay for entrepreneurship, no points for globalization) and have spoken to the owner on many occasions, most likely because the family is CHINESE, not Korean and have been able to speak to them while waiting for my avo-burg. The owner (in ref. to Nobu's Asian guy lookin' at you) is named Nelson. Talk to him about Yelp, he was pretty excited to get the good reviews.  I love kimchee and may ask about a kimchee burger hybrid for next year's menu. \n\nMoral of the review: great food, huge portions, well valued and worth the wait. \n\n=)", "author": "Festher C."}

The service was pretty good, the cashier was probably the owner from the looks of and and it seems like he works hard.\n\nThe do it yourself/self serve bar for toppings was what got me. I piled up lots of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The toppings were very fresh and plentiful. \n\nThe beef patty was pretty burnt and charred. It looked like it was pre-cooked and then heated up again on the grill. Maybe Im wrong. I checked both burgers and they were made exactly the same, both overcooked/burnt! \n\nOn top of that, we didnt even get natural beef. Natural beef is an extra $.75. That is such a bad idea. Why would you post a sign stating that natural beef will cost extra? It makes customers like me who get the normal beef feel like Im eating crap. \n\nThe fries were better than Mcdonalds/BK/fastfood default fries though. They put weird nacho cheese type sauce on \"cheese fries\" so beware.\n\nPrices were okay but overall it was disappointing. The burger wasn't hot as I expected and it was overcooked or cooked again after it was sitting around. I love the do it yourself toppings but I don't think it would save the patty if it tastes like charcoal.\n\nI'll be back to see if they still burn their burgers.", "author": "SF N."}

My boyfriend and I walk into Belly Burger and didn't see anyone at the counter to take our order.  As we walk to the empty cash register, a girl comes out of almost nowhere and greets us.

I settle for a cheese burger with jack cheese and mushrooms (yum, jack cheese!) and french fries and onion rings.  \n\nThe decor is not much to speak of, but wasn't expecting much from a small burger joint.  There is a wall full of '50's inspired tin posters advertising coca cola, ketchup, home cooking and the like.  A tv is on on the opposite wall and it's turned onto a game show.\n\nTen minutes pass and we're presented with our burgers.  We're advised to put all the toppings we want on them from the condiments bar.  The bar had everything-- iceberg and green leaf lettuce, red and yellow onions, jalapenos, relish, pickles, sprouts and kidney beans (yes, kidney beans...in case someone wants a kidney bean on their burger?!) and a few others.  \n\nThe moment of truth--a decent burger!  The mushrooms, cheese, and the toppings from the bar were on point.  The beef was tasty, but I realized they didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and it was a bit rarer than I prefer it (I like it medium well).  Wonder if I should have paid the extra $0.75 for the angus beef.

First off the people that work here are super nice all the time which is a plus, and they have a great condiment bar that's very well stocked to say the least, white and red onions, two types of lettuce, olives, pineapple and a bunch if other stuff which is different from any other burger place I've been to. So the bad part is I think that they're kind of overpriced for the burger/setting and the extras are over priced for sure $1 for gilled onions. Also sometimes the burgers are over cooked (which to me is an ultimate burger sin) I want my burger juicy not crispy :( also I kind of have \"beef\" with there sweet potato \"fries\" I use that word lightly because they're more of fried slices of sweet potato and when cut like that they just don't taste right. There regular fires are okay but I think they might be frozen. All in all not a bad place but unfortunately just not reliable for a properly cooked burger.", "author": "Dominique D."}

Didn't want truffles or foie gras. Just a good burger. I read several good reviews on this place so I had to try it. \n\nOne thing I always love about a\"good burger joint\" is that the ambiance is inviting and fun. Nothing special when I got here. No \"Welcome to Belly's\" when I came in. Maybe that's a southern thing. \n\nOn to the burger because it seems that's what this place should be all about. I got the double cheeseburger and a small order of fries.\nThe size of the burger was great! The bun was off the grill, but didn't have butter, which I can live without. They have a condiment/fixins bar to dress up the burger yourself. I sat down to wait for my order, which was to go, and noticed the cheese options no where near the burger menu. Well, i'm out of luck, cause the burger is almost done. I guess i'm getting American, though if he would have asked what kind of cheese, I would have definitely asked for cheddar. I guess it's my fault for not reading the entire menu. When the burger was ready, they set it on the counter open faced so you can hit the condiments. They had some options you wouldn't find everywhere, but the leaf lettuce was the only thing that looked fresh. When done I went back to the counter where he packed everything up for me to take home.\n\nThe burger was ok. The main flavor was the char from cooking. The bun was cheap and fell apart from the juices before I ate half the burger. \n\nBasically, with a little seasoning and a good bun, this could be a better burger.\n\nThe fries were below average. \n\nI well definitely be continuing my search for a good burger joint in the Richmond.", "author": "Cory G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-18", "description": "This is a really fine, no nonsense kinda burger joint. When it opened up around the corner from my house, I decided it was worth making an effort to support it, especially given that the other places nearby that have burgers are Bill's Place (overpriced and overrated), and the Rainbow 24 Hour Video Diner (the best place to be drunk and lonely at 3am) which serves the same frozen burgers we used to have on monthly cookout night at the YMCA summer camp. Attempting to lend my support to Belly, I went around the corner to another new place which bore the putrid smell of rapid and crushing eatery failure, took their Grand Opening banner since it wasn't helping anyway, and brought it over to Belly. However, the people who run the place are painfully kind (though reserved), and seemed uncomfortable with displaying a banner stolen from a block away. Fortunately, it seems that business has picked up of late, even without my generous support.\n\nWhile it isn't really the serious foodie's shangri la, it's a prime choice for a delicious burger. The burger is real big and juicy (shout out to sir mix-a-lot)...my preferred prep is to get it cooked rare, with no salt on the patty or butter on the bun. don't worry, it'll still taste good and kill you a bit slower.  For $5.75 you really can't beat it. \n\nOver the last couple years the veggies have consistently improved. The condiments are also improving, although I'm still waiting for barbecue sauce- why burger joints have been able to get away with the more costly \"Barbecue Burger\" scam instead of including barbecue sauce with the condiments, I'll never know. The featured condiments are mayo, mustard, ketchup, tabasco, and red chili flakes. \n\nOne drawback is the mediocrity of the wings and the fried chicken. I think this could be cleared up with a little work on the batter, and some subtlety with the sauce on wings. Overall though, this place is really good, and I'm glad it's a block from my home.", "author": "noah c."}

You can get natural beef there, beef with none of the hormones, steroids and antibiotics found in most ground beef. And it tastes amazing. The burgers are cooked on some kind of volcanic rock that gives them a delicious outdoor grilled taste. The fries are perfect. They're real potatoes, not frozen, and you can taste that. Two people can share one bag of fries, it's huge. The toppings bar is totally fresh with a great assortment of standard toppings and some you don't see anyplace else, like pineapple and jalapeno peppers. Tongs are provided for each item. I am addicted to pineapple, pickle, sprouts, lettuce and tomato on my burger and I will never get that exact combination any place else so they have my business for life....Water is free. That's all I've ever had but they do have an extensive menu with a lot of burger joint type stuff, fried chicken, fish and chips, hot dogs, a very well priced steak sandwich..lots of good choices, although I love the Natural Beef burger, which has a wonderful flavor. They also offer about 5 different cheeses to top your burger and you can also get griled onions, avocado and a number of other specialty toppings from the kitchen.\n\nParking is next door in a public lot and the 38 Geary bus stops right on the corner. They close at 10 pm. \n\nThere's a flat screen TV, usually with a game on, sometimes the news or a kid friendly movie. There is also a small garden with a few tables out back so you can sit outside on a beautiful day. The place is super clean and family friendly and by family friendly I mean, the restroom is spotless and big enough for you and 2 kids and a dog.. If I'm having a burger in the Richmond, this is where I go. Prices are about the same as a fast food place, which amazes me because the quality of food at Belly Burger is so high.

They have several cheese options for the cheeseburger (American, Swiss, jack, pepper jack, etc.).\n\nThe first couple of times I went there, it was absolutely great.  But, later on, there were a couple of times when my food didn't taste quite as good and I noticed that this was when Belly Burger was busy.  Some people on here complain that their food takes a long time.  If you want your food in 2 minutes, go to McDonald's.  I would rather wait 5-10 minutes for good food than get instant crap (and a swift kick to the stomach, like Bill's place will give you).\n\nAfter that, I avoided Belly when they were busy, so as not to get inferior food for my dollar.  But recently, I did go there when they were busy and the food was just as good as usual.\n\nBelly Burger's burgers always taste fresh and delicious.  With Belly in the neighborhood, I don't need to suffer through another Bill's burger, where you don't know which bite will taste rotten, and the service sucks, and you pay $2-$3 more.\n\nThe only hamburger I like more than Belly's is the one at Pork Store Cafe on Haight, the mushroom burger.  I think I had a mushroom burger at Belly once, and the mushrooms were not very tasty.  But Belly Burger is definetely the best place I've been to in the Richmond (Bill's=questionable, Hamburger Haven=ok, Video Cafe=disgusting).  I haven't been to Buffalo Burger yet, but if it's the same as the one in West Portal, then I'm not missing much.

The idea of the condiment bar is great but most of the fixin's were gone when we were there.  No dijon mustard either?  Chicken sandwich was ok.  Prices seem reasonable on some items and outrageous on others for no reason.  It tries.  It fails.", "author": "M M."}

Had a few well done burgers after specifically requesting medium rare as well as american cheese when I specifically asked for swiss. Also was rebuked at a request to have chili added to my fries on the combo platter. Instead of making a customer happy and adding $2 bucks to the combo for the chili, the non friendly gal working there tried to charge me like $12 for the thing piece meal. I explained to her that it was ridiculous, but she would have nothing to do with my request. Guess what, I now walk an extra 3 blocks to Bills Place for my twice weekly burgers. Probably better for my waistline getting the exercise.", "author": "Hank S."}

Unfortunately nothing douses the flames of burger desire as much as nacho cheese sauce engulfing your crispy golden fries.  Alas, I brought said fries back to the counter and told the burger man they weren't what I was hoping for.  He knew right away I wanted shredded cheddar instead.  I got some regular fries in the end.  The burger was just OK.  Condiment bar was nice.  They still have some figuring out to do, nice idea though.  Try Custom Burger instead.", "author": "Matt P."}

Generous size, meaty, sufficiently juicy, and fresh. Nothing like the fast food fare, and they beat the nearby Bill's place hands down. I really like the condiment bar - a free run of all kinds of fresh veggies & addons with every burger. Yum!\n\nThe other fare is so-so. Service was always fast and friendly.\n\nI'd give them 4 stars for this neighborhood, if not for the Buffalo Burgers just up Geary.", "author": "Sandra B."}

If someone told me that it was possible for service to be slower than Slider's, my jaw would drop in disbelief. Pick your jaws up, people: It's true. I waited no less than 15 minutes this afternoon for a chocolate milkshake. JUST a chocolate milkshake. Not malted, not extra large. Just regular. And I was the only person there. Surprisingly, no one seemed concerned that the shake had been in the shaker for about 10 minutes. Then the man was painfully slow about pouring all of my shake into a cup that only held half the contents of the shake can. He  tries to give me just the dinky cup and send me on my merry way. Umm...I didn't pay 5 dollars and sacrifice 15 minutes of my life that I will never be able to get back for a half cup of melted ice cream. That didn't just happen. I ask for the rest AND I ask again for the whipped cream I'd already asked for. The man looked shocked and amazed that anyone would make such an exotic request. We worked it out. But it was painful. And the shake just made me feel chubby. I'll go back and try the burger someday. Maybe.", "author": "Autumn K."}

What can I say? I was intrigued. I've lived in this neighborhood all my life and Belly Burger (after Arby's and that NASTY Asian restaurant) was the only incarnation of this place I ever considered setting foot in and actually trying the food. Plus, I was in the mood for a burger. I got a bacon avocado cheeseburger. It was DAMN good. And not very expensive. I didn't get any fries but from the sounds of the reviews, I should have. The woman at the counter was really nice. The service was a bit slow, but there were quite a few people in there so I was ok with that. I was really impressed with the do it yourself condiment bar. That way, I don't get onions or anything else I don't like on my burger. I have to mention that I took mine to go and it was still intact and not soggy when I got it home (when the 38 finally came).", "author": "Lindsey S."}

My friend and I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money so that's why we choose this place. I say $10.84 for a bacon cheeseburger combo isn't bad. For a Sunday around 1pm... there wasn't much of a crowd at all. The girl at the counter was very nice and delivered speedy service. The wait for our food was around 10 minutes, not long at all. They give you a plain burger so you can choose what you want to put on it. The meat tasted fresh, but the bacon was a little undercooked. We were really looking forward to the sweet potato fries, but they did not live up to our expectation. I felt like they should have cut it into thinner pieces and it was lacking flavor. It was also very soft.. I was expecting a crunchy outside and a soft inside. Oh well though, at least I know where not to buy sweet potato fries from. Anyways, I like how they take phone orders so if you are ever in a rush, you can just walk in and pick up your food to-go. Other than burgers, they also sell hot dogs and corn dogs.. which I think is pretty awesome. The restaurant itself is fairly tiny so I can see how it can get packed easily. There is a TV inside so you have something to do while you wait for you food. But yes, over all this is a decent burger joint. It's reasonably priced and the food is satisfying. It's definitely worth giving a try!", "author": "Rosa L."}

I mean common, 'Belly burger'.  The taste was okay, the service was super slow, and the way they make their hambergers, the smoke that comes from the grill sort of comes out in the dining area.  I came home and my roomates commented that I smelled like smoke or bbq.  The staff was super short handed, but however very nice.

It's lame but I kept seeing ads in SF Weekly for this place, so my interest was piqued.  The joint has an almost retro-50's diner vibe- but no stools, no Moxie and none of those goofy little hats they wear- and an unusually U-shaped \"help yo'self\" fixins bar chock full of fresh sliced veggies (3 lettuce types!), salad fixins (?) and a butt-load of condiment options.  Strange, but I wasn't even sure if I'm allowed on the other side of the bar... where the soda fountain is... it looks like the workers' side of the counter... can I go there, dude?  Anyway, I didn't.  I got the BBQ Cheeseburger.  To some surprise, the cashier/server/cook/owner (?) brought out our burgers on these GIANT round plates.  They looked like HUGE upside-down frisbees, and my burger looked so teeny sitting there in all it's bbq'd glory.  I wasn't impressed though.  To me, my burger (the-non-natural-beef-for-an-extra-75-cent-kind) tasted like a store bought frozen patty with store bought bottled bbq sauce (which was slathered liberally, btw)  I added a bunch of veggies though, so it wasn't awful.
