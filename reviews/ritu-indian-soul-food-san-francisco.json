But we forget that long before the Internet, people found the best meals by word-of-mouth. Ritu, on the recommendation of my cousins, happened to serve up one of those delightful dinners.\n\nWe hopped in on a Wednesday evening and it was almost entirely empty. True to the ultra-trendy feel of San Franciscan restaurants, it features glowy hanging lamp orbs, lots of light wood accents, and an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook up some delights. Opting to have a good conversation instead, we sat down at one of the three-person tables toward the front.\n\nWithin minutes of sitting down, someone came by to take our order. We went with three crowd favorites: chicken tikka masala with naan, lamb biryani, and chicken biryani. Everything was cooked to order and came out very quickly, an excellent selling point for diners who want a fast meal.\n\nAlthough it wasn't my dish, I sampled a bit of the chicken tikka masala off of my cousin's plate. Wow, the poultry was so tender that I barely had to chew before it melted in my mouth. It was also so creamy that it brought forth visions of cats lapping up cream from saucers. I'd definitely recommend this as an intro to Indian cuisine for not-so-adventurous eaters.\n\nOur biryanis were served with tiny bowls of chaat with chickpeas that really cut through the spice profile of the rice. I was also really pleased with the color of the rice, which came a gorgeous yellow that looked as fragrant and delicate as it was. I could not finish that heaping plate in one sitting, but I found myself at a point where I just wanted to keep eating the chunks of lamb. Like the chicken, it was supremely tender, and spiced very well. Someone offered up a takeout box for leftovers, and I can confirm that it tastes almost as magical reheated.", "author": "Gwen W."}

For ex, one of their bread options was the broccoli cheese paratha, where the bread wasn't stuffed with indian cottage cheese (paneer) but some sort of swiss cheese and tasted average. We ordered the malai kofta for the main entree and it was stuffed with green peas, something I hadn't seen anywhere else but I wasn't too impressed with the pairing.\n\nThe place was quite empty on a saturday night and the service was slow.

I thought it could use a touch more salt, but the dish was great. The curry was nice and buttery which made it perfect for dipping into naan!\n\nSurprisingly, I loved the desserts here. I had the Pistachio Pot de Creme and Rice Pudding. Both desserts weren't overly sweet but still decadent enough to satisfy at the end of the meal!

That may be due to its genesis from a popular albeit modest food truck at Off the Grid to a brick-and-mortar space that housed the late, lamented Local Mission Eatery on 24th Street,  a more ambitious venture that closed a couple of Decembers ago. Owner Rupam Bhagat has taken advantage of Local's modern decor and wisely kept his menu simple and straightforward. It also appears to have a decidedly Southern twang. Not southern like Kerala, I mean Deep South like something off the interstate in Georgia. For instance, main plates include Tandoori Fried Chicken and Seafood Stew.\n\nTraditionalists need not worry as more recognizably South Asian fare like Paneer Kofta, Vegetable Korma, and Samosas were present and accounted for (photo: http://bit.ly/2CgLZJl). Being somewhat restrictive in my nutritional intake, I zeroed in on the mysterious $13 Vegetarian Bowl of the Day in the Biryani section, so I interrogated the server about it. He simply described it as delicious if you don't eat meat. Sold. I'm not a strict vegetarian but I play one on TV. Wait, wasn't that a commercial for Vicks Formula 44? Anyhow, I've been having more and more veggie and vegan meals just to even my system out. Turned out the server was right, and I have a feeling it was Rupam because he spoke of the food so meticulously and discouraged me from ordering any side dishes as the portion was generous.\n\nWell OK then. He was right, and it was full of goodness starting with the fresh okra, carrots, green beans, and peas down to the seared onion strings, julienned cilantro, and saffron-infused jasmine rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2pQd9lA). It was a Bollywood-style Chipotle veggie burrito bowl amped up with South Asian flair. I did have the temerity to order the $3 side of Paneer cheese, which came cubed and sauced (photo: http://bit.ly/2DtRYrm). It had a luxuriant texture and was probably completely unnecessary to my meal, but it was tasty. There was also a small bowl of chaat with chickpeas that made a lovely accompaniment as well (photo: http://bit.ly/2Dts2fj). By the way, I believe the term DUM refers literally to cooking with steam, but they are quick to point out that it's Mumbai-originated soul food with a twist of California freshness. I can dig it.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...vegetable biryani done with freshness and culinary style\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...sleekly modern, understandably took advantage of how Local Mission presented themselves before\nSERVICE - 4 stars...was that you, Rupam?\nTOTAL - 4 stars...looking forward to trying more of the fashionably home-style dishes they are intent on offering", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-25", "description": "DUM was entirely empty on a Sunday evening at 6:45, so we were seated instantly, but not before trying to figure out how to open the door to the restaurant with a broken handle, which seemed to be an issue for every single party that entered the restaurant after us. One of the waiters had to keep running to the door to let people in. A \"pull\" sign was definitely needed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with the samosas and tandoori fried chicken. There are two samosas to an order and each one was really big, stuffed to almost bursting with soft, fluffy potatoes and peas, and the pastry was perfectly flaky and crispy. Two sauces accompanied the samosas: the traditional green chutney, which was great, and a tamarind sauce. That one was a little fruity, a little bright, and a little savory, and definitely unique. The tandoori chicken was phenomenal: tender pieces of boneless chicken in a tangy, spicy \"BBQ sauce\" with a little zing, but surprisingly it was the broccoli that was especially eye opening. The florets were just crispy enough to add some interesting texture, and something about the broccoli paired especially well with that sauce and we couldn't get enough.\n\nFor the main entrees we went with the chicken biryani, because we'd read that DUM is known for their different biryani dishes, as well as the pork vindaloo and a side of multigrain naan. However, we also ordered a small side of basmati saffron rice, and this is where the service, which had been fantastic, got a little weird. The waiter seemed a little confused as to why we wanted a small side of basmati when we were already getting the biryani, and I explained that I wanted it with the vindaloo. I didn't want to mix the distinct flavors of the vindaloo and the biryani, and I'm also a bit of a rice fiend, though I didn't mention that to the waiter. After taking the order back to the kitchen, a second waiter came out and asked us to confirm that we wanted the basmati rice. When the entrees were brought out we didn't get the basmati so I reminded the waiter that we'd ordered it. He hesitated and went back to the kitchen, and one of the previous waiters came to the table and said that he \"stopped us\" from getting the basmati, but if we really still wanted it he would ask the kitchen to serve it. Needless to say by this point I was a little annoyed and put off, but I kept smiling and asked that they please bring it out.\n\nThe biryani was cooked well, with fluffy rice and tender pieces of chicken, but I felt, flavor wise, it lacked the complexity and boldness of the tandoori chicken and the tamarind sauce of the samosas and was a little underwhelming. The vindaloo, on the other hand, was spicy and packed a punch of great flavors, with tender chicken and potatoes, though I really wanted more of that delicious sauce. Compared to other Indian restaurants this vindaloo was served with very little sauce. The multigrain naan was unusual but absolutely delicious and had a warm, nutty flavor that I felt paired well with the bright, spicy vindaloo.\n\nFor dessert we went with the roasted rice pudding and kulfi falooda. The rice pudding was wonderful, with what tasted like cinnamon and perhaps a little underlying citrus, and topped with crunchy cashew nut brittle. I thought that was a great juxtaposition of texture. I wasn't a fan of the kulfi falooda, unfortunately. I'd never ordered it before and wanted to try something new, but the ice cream was really hard, which wasn't enjoyable to eat, and the flavors of the cardamom milk and basil seeds just weren't for me.\n\nNeither was the masala Coke, which was a regular Coca-Cola with masala seasoning and lime. While unique and definitely different, the raw seasoning sprinkled and mixed into the Coke was too powerful and potent to enjoy in a drink.\n\nThe wait staff were all extremely attentive and easy to flag down if needed. Aside from the awkward encounter regarding the rice service was smooth and fast and everyone was really friendly. The interior is warm, with dark woods, hanging metal lanterns, cushioned seats, and beautiful tables inlaid with blue subway tile. DUM is just a handful of blocks from the 24th and Mission BART station.\n\nI'm a little on the fence about the value of DUM. The tandoori chicken was the star but for $14 the pieces of chicken were small and accompanied by few pieces of broccoli. The biryani at $15 was slightly underwhelming, but the greatest offender in terms of price was the pork vindaloo. I've received more vindaloo at other Indian restaurants for less money ($16), and while DUM's was tasty it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had and was a bit on the dry side.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back to DUM, but if I was in the area I wouldn't be opposed to coming back.", "author": "Angela M."}

The Bhel had great flavor, consistency, and appreciation for Californian flare (hello, avocado & sprouts!). As a former vegetarian, I appreciated the healthy twist and California influence to a dish that is generally seen as quick street food. Although the meat (which was plentiful) was a little dry in both the main entries, I thought the dishes had the perfect amount of spices. The garlic naan was coated in the perfect amount of butter and garlic. The portions were also large enough to share family style. In fact, we ended up boxing up the remaining mans + side and are looking forward to eating our leftovers tomorrow night for Indian Soul Food Dinner Round 2.\n\nThe boyfriend paired his dinner with an IPA. We also received a mango lassi on the house.

That's why I love curries. The sauce counteracts the chewiness of the chicken. Even though the kati roll came with onion, lime, and cilantro, it needed a sauce to provide a little more moisture since the chicken wasn't particularly tender. I actually ended up using the mint chutney from my samosa as a spread for the kati roll. Speaking of samosas, these are huge! My favorite part of the meal. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So good! Now, I normally love greens, but the salad didn't really mix together well. The ingredients seemed a little disjointed. Plus, the dressing had no flavor. It just tasted like oil. I did like the arugula in the salad as I put it to my kati roll for an added freshness.\n\nI wish they offered a chicken tikka masala kati roll as I think that would have solved made the chicken seem less dry.

Yup, it's a baby of Indian food and traditional African-American soul food.\n\nWhen cultures collide, great things can happen. We walked in on a chill Friday night--the whole place wasn't entirely full, but for a place that was still in its soft opening...it was doing very well! The three of us sat in the communal table and noticed that the walls were a bit bare and the restaurant itself still seemed to be \"in the works\" aesthetics and service smoothness-wise. We were greeted promptly upon entering, and loved that open kitchen concept and very minimalist vibes.\n\nWe stared with the Goat cheese paratha. I've had puff paratha in the frozen food aisle before, but I did not expect this paratha to be thicker almost pupusa-style. The texture was a bit harder unlike typical corn flour. I loved it though and it was easily shared between three of us. There were lots of meat options (thank the soul food part), but also lots of veggie ones too! I went with the palak paneer which was basically mushroom in a sweetish coconut curry sauce on circular beds of spinach. SO good, I think it was perfect in portion size and so good with the roti/puff paratha that came with my meal. Their roti was SO good, and probably my favorite item. Flaky, fresh, and so soft! Food itself is amazing, and I'm so glad their menu items are so creative and interesting--like fried chicken tikka masala! \n\nPricing was average for SF, and a bit pricier compared to Indian food dinner. However, this place has got a modern vibe with its menu uniqueness and \"uppity YUPPY-trying-to-be-lowkey\" ambiance. Servers were all smiley and polite, but a bit slow to react at times.\n\nI'm excited to see DUM flourish and grow as they figure out more comfortable service (prolonged staring can sometimes be awk) and learn their fluid flow in running their store.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-28", "description": "A colleague of mine recommended this place to me when I was giving a for-fun presentation at work about Indian food. I talked about how there's so much more to Indian food than chicken tikka masala or curries in general. Dum embodies this statement. There's no curry on the menu!!! There is excellent food though. I'd say the ambience is casual/trendy. Seems a little bit more upscale than most Indian restaurants tbh. \n\nThe menu is simple- chaats (street food, snacky items), sandwiches (with indian meats), kathi rolls (think wrap or burrito made with soft, flaky indian bread and filled with your choice of meat or vegetable), biryani, a salad, and a select few desserts. We always like trying multiple things at new restaurants and Dum also has provisions built-in for that! If you order a sandwich, kathi roll, or biryani, you can get a half order of a chaat for $4 (which is great when boyfriend wants a different chaat from you). Full orders of chaat are in the $7-$10 range. As usual, we got more food than we needed. We got a chicken biryani (the server recommended it and the menu claimed that the SF chronicle called it the best biryani in town- how can you not order that?), a chicken kathi roll, and a half order each of samosa chaat and dahi puri.\n\nFood came out fairly fast. The first chaat to arrive at our table was the dahi puri. This was undoubtedly the best bite of the day. It was quite possibly better than what I've had in most places in India. Everything from yogurt to sauce ratio to the crispiness of the puri was perfect. If you have never had this before-here's how you eat these babies: they are supposed to be one bite each- that means you pick up the entire thing and stuff it in your mouth. I promise you the explosion in your mouth will keep you dancing for a few minutes! Next came the samosa chaat and it was just as authentic as our first chaat. Samosa crushed up into pieces and topped with yellow split peas, chutneys and sev- what's not to love? The kathi roll was very good although not as authentic and quite greasy. The paratha was soft and had a layer of egg on the inside. It had the right amount of subtle sweetness, which I really enjoyed. The inside was absolutely packed with chicken- the chicken wasn'tquite what I picture when I think kathi roll, but it was tasty nonetheless. They recommend two kathi rolls for a meal. I think one kathi roll and one half chaat is more than enough food for lunch. Maybe two kathi rolls for dinner or if you have a really big appetite. The last item to arrive was the Biryani, and unfortunately I was less than thrilled with it. It had the right elements of a good chicken biryani- the white and yellow/orange rice, fried onions on top, nice dark chicken meat, but it was lacking a little bit of salt and just didn't have the right biryani seasonings. It was also topped with cilantro, which sure makes things look pretty but just doesn't belong in biryani. \n\nOverall, this place is a solid 4.5 stars- rounding up to 5 because of their menu- I respect a place that is trying to introduce people to more than chicken tikka masala!", "author": "Debika M."}

It was a pretty casual and unfancy spot--but the waiters were kind and the food was basically exactly the same as their food truck offerings when I stopped by for lunch one Saturday. The restaurant was pretty much completely empty, so we got seated and ordered speedily.\n\nWe started with the dahi puri--a street food made of semolina puffs filled with a potato/chickpea mixture, tamarind-flavored water, and plenty of yogurt. The flavors were really nice but didn't last that long on your palate. By far, the best dish I tried was the samosa chaat, made of pieces of torn-up samosa in a chickpea mixture. The dish was creamy and crunchy, warm and spicy--it was so well spiced and the flavors just danced on your palate! The Chicken 65 sandwich was decent though not all that memorable--just pieces of fried dark meat chicken on a baguette. And finally, the kati roll with ground lamb, peas, and egg was delicious as well, though again not all that special.\n\nOverall, a nice stop for a quick and light lunch. However, the food wasn't really a step up at all from their food truck menu and was relatively expensive for the portion sizes.

This place is really brightly decorated on the inside. I really liked the atmosphere and it added to the warmth of the restaurant. We wanted to try a few different things so we decided to order 2 smaller plates and an order of their Biryani. We ate:\n\n-Achuri (?) Chaat: This was a special on the board and had FABULOUS flavor. This was so much bigger than we thought it was going to be and I was pretty much full after this small plate. I would definitely order it again.\n\n-Potato and Goat Cheese Stuffed Bread-DELICIOUS. Also huge. I am not the biggest fan of goat cheese but after this, I am a believer. It wasn't too greasy or heavy. I loved this but would definitely try a different one of their stuffed breads next time for something different\n\n-Lamb Biryani: This was good but I think overrated, especially compared to how good the other 2 dishes were! I would order this again but would want to try other items on their menu first.\n\nWe really liked the food here and hope to come back to try more of their menu.

The corn parantha was okay at best, and the kulfi falooda was good . \n\nThere are a few things you should know though: substitutions and slight changes will not be accommodated, no matter how minor. \n\nWe asked for a portion of our dahi puri and paani puri to be half and half, since one of us was lactose intolerant. They're pretty similar so I thought this wasn't unreasonable, but it wouldn't be done. The lassi can't be done plain, but only with the fruit flavor - which is strange since you'd imagine they make a plain lassi and add fruit/flavor to it. These aren't ruining the meal for me, but I think could've helped me have a better experience. \n\nAlso, kathi rolls are only at lunch (not sure where I could've read this online). If you want to have it at dinner, they'll make it for you, but you can't have it in the restaurant. it has to be to-go. No explanation why. What is that about?", "author": "Vickram S."}

The lamb in the kati roll was actually ground meat which surprised me. I thought it was going to be slices. It was still pretty good. The samosa chaat was also good, lots of chickpeas. The dahi puri was excellent - the yogurt with the tamarind sauce added a nice cool and sweet taste to it. For the food, the quantity of food is good compared to what you pay for. samosa chaat and dahi puri were both definitely worth adding on for $4 to your meal.  We had the mango lassi which if you dine in, is comparatively smaller in volume for $5 compared to other places so I probably wouldn't get it again. \n\nService: the Nepalese server had difficulty understanding us, though he seemed to be trying. We were asking questions about the menu, but he took it as we needed more time to look at it and left us, still burning with questions. he is a nice guy though.

The Biryani was on the drier side for me, I usually like a Biryani that is more seasoned and retains more moisture but this one was fairly dry so the yogurt was a good side with it. Not as seasoned and flavorful as homemade but not bad either. \n\nThe Kati Roll was the better part of the meal. It was packed with meat and sauce and onions. It was flavorful and well seasoned. Definitely would recommend this! \n\nOne thing that I didn't personally enjoy about the place was the waiters constantly coming up to the table. They would come around way too often. At one point I was pouring my boyfriend's beer from the bottle in to his glass and the waiter came over and gestured to take the bottle and do it himself.

It's only $35 per person and well worth every penny.Our dinner included crisped kale with home made trail mix and yogurt sauce; a kebab sampler with the lamb t bone, pork rib and chicken marinated in a yogurt based marinade; lamb biriyani; chick peas in a curry sauce, and a rice pudding with golden raisins in it topped with a caramel and pistachio crackle. We had a mango lassi and chai tea as well, which were equally as delicious to our taste. \n\nNow for the service. Their service was (yet again) amazing.

The location and look of the restaurant is super unassuming, so it's really the food that sets it apart. And dear god is it good.\n\n* Lamb Biryani - HOLY CRAP. I never thought I was a biryani fan, but I want to live in a bowl of this. Forever. The big pieces of lamb in some part, and broken up in others, so you could make the perfect bite depending on how meaty you're feeling at the moment. It was flavored so well. I tried to be polite to my friends with whom I was sharing, but eventually i moved the bowl closer to me and just went to town. It comes with a chunky Raita that was wonderful on it's own!\n\n* Kale Cakes: Light and crunchy and creamy and sexy. Yep, sexy. This was a nice light change from some of the heavier dishes.\n\n* Dahi Puri - Indian Paradox (another fantastic indian street food restaurant in town) introduced me to this dish, and now I have to have it when I see it on a menu. Theirs was really delicious as well, and I loved the amount of spices and goodies on top. Great dish to share among friends.\n\n* Lamb Keema Stuff bread - If this is what Pizza hut has been trying to make all along, they just need to stop. This stuffed bread is SO. TASTY. Loved the pickled onions veggies on the side. Really rounded this dish out.\n\n* BroccoliI/Cauliflower/Amul Cheese Stuffed bread - Just as fantastic as the Lamb one. I think I may have liked this one better, but that may have just been because I was also eating Lamb Biryani with it.\n\n* Shrimp Coconut Curry + Bread - I want a Costco sized vat of this to put on everything. It's crack curry. It has to be. The shrimp were big and tender and cooked perfectly. The most exciting combo was the toasted Hawaiian roll-like sweet bread on the side.

The Dahi Puri (a puff/pastry w/ Yogurt, potatoes and spices) was a nice way to cool down after the samosa chaat. Both are highly recommended!\n\nMain Course: I had the Paneer Kati roll, and a paratha! I loved the Kati roll had trouble finishing the paratha as the starters + Kati roll were very filling. \n\nI was too full to try the deserts! Next time. My friends had the chicken biryani and they loved it that they ordered a second serving!\n\nThey have a small wine + beer list which can be nicely paired w the Biryani and Kati rolls. \n\nDefinitely a must try if you have a craving for simple, casual food in the Mission district. They are new, so if you can't locate them, they are right next door to the original Philz Coffee location which you cannot miss.\n\nTwo Thumbs up!", "author": "Balaji T."}

The biryani is a must. We had a lamb & a veggie one. Both were spiced perfectly. We'll be coming back for sure.", "author": "Erik T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-30", "description": "This is a new take on Indian food: the way it is served, presented, and made. I enjoyed the surprises. The price was reasonable. The ambience and decor was great. The service was very good. There is a fusion element to it. The Chef is also the owner and they make the dishes in front of you. The menu is small. I prefer smaller menus with good quality. I don't like those endless Indian buffets where all the curries taste the same and have oil and cream floating on top. The milder spices agreed with us,  even though we are of Indian origin.", "author": "Lakshmi S."}

Flawless execution across an impressive range of Indian regional delicacies - dahi puri, kati rolls, and kebabs (scotch egg) all deserve best ever status.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-02", "description": "Decided to try this spot for lunch, ordered Dahi Puri, Paneer Kathi roll and Mango Lassi! The only good part was Mango lassi. The Dahi Puri was loaded with sweet Dahi, cannot get any other flavor besides the yogurt. Felt like I had put a dollop of sweet Yogurt in my mouth. The Paneer kathi roll was really soggy and oily. The decor is nice tough! If they get the food right, this place has potential.", "author": "S J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-10-02", "description": "This was a terrible experience. They should not call themselves dum and then serve terrible biryani because the name suggests otherwise. I ordered a chicken kathi which came rolled up in what looked like an instant Malaysian parantha and not at all fresh. The lamb biryani came in a small portion for $15 and was the worst tasting biryani I ever had, meat tasted terrible still not sure how they managed that. My wife who loves Indian food could not even finish 10% of her veggie biryani. My stomach hurt the whole night after eating here. Save your money eat elsewhere.", "author": "Abhishek S."}

A street already full of amazing options of taquerias and cafes,  Dum Indian Soulfood fits in perfectly.  While the menu isn't the usual Indian restaurant style, packed with 100 options,  that's what makes this place unique. It's a curated menu of simple kati rolls, biriyani bowls, and chaats. (No stereotypical chicken tikka masala here, thank god!!) Each dish is done with super fresh ingredients, is so flavorful and isn't covered in sauces, grease and creams that most places have.  You walk out full, but not feeling heavy and gross. The paneer masala kati roll is packed with wonderful spice,  perfect for a quick snack, but 2 of them to fill you up.  The space is clean and spacious.  I only put 4 stars because I think the place could stand to add more character into the decor, but overall a delish delight and I'll certainly be going back often", "author": "S A."}
