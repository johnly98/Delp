Glad we stopped by and ordered before reading other reviews! Actually decent prices and food was pretty good. We had the vegetarian eggrolls which were with the vermicelli noodles and shitake mushrooms which I like. It had taro in it as well but could not distinguish this- overall good. \n\nPad Thai was the usual and good. Then we had the pumpkin curry and they use kombocha squash instead. I love kombocha but pumpkin would be even better, but understandable since not in season. So the dish was still good and mine was spicy enough that I liked it. \n\nNice and clean. Service was friendly and quick. They were very attentive and filled our water cups. This will be one of my quick go-tos when I am in this area! I can't wait to try the other dishes ( my son only wanted Pad Thai but loved it all after eating it all) bc I saw other diners and they had the rad na( like chow fun) and angel wings which looked even better than what we had- Yum!", "author": "EllenMarie S."}

They have a special lunch menu which is great for your wallet.  You can pick 1 or 2 items for just under 10.00.   That's a pretty good deal for the amount you get.  \n\nI got the Ga Prow with chicken with chili, garlic, bell pepper and sweet basil along with the Pad Ma-Kuer with was saut\u00e9ed eggplant with fried tofu, chili, bell pepper, onion and basil.

I probably wouldn't have come here on my own due to the lower reviews for this place, but I'm glad that it was recommended!\n\nTheir menu is quite extensive and their lunch menu offers a shorter list of options, but still great variety. You can select one or two entrees from the lunch specials list and it comes rice and soup or salad. \n\nI chose the salad, which came with a sweet dressing and Pad Thai and Green Curry with Prawns. The pad thai was pretty good and came with lots of tofu and two tiny prawns. You can choose your protein for the green curry. I wanted more prawns which was an additional $2. I believe it only came with two prawns. Chicken or beef is a better deal! I chose this curry specifically because it offered eggplant, but I didn't notice any in my portion. It also wasn't spicy at all. Perhaps I should have asked for extra spicy! Despite all this, it was pretty good curry, perfectly creamy and delicious to mix with my rice!

I placed my order a few minutes after 5, and it arrived a few minutes before 6. The woman who took my order said delivery would take 25 minutes. Let's move on to the food. The green curry with chicken was at least medium spicy, but I ordered mild. I had to strain the solids from the too spicy liquid. Where was the curry flavor? The stir fried veggies consisted of mostly pale white cabbage, bean sprouts, and soggy fried tofu, not exactly the crisp stir fried green veggies I had imagined. But worst of all was the brown rice. Instead of visible grains of rice, I got what looked like a big glob of thick, mushy rice pudding. It's really sad that Vanida Thai would stoop so low as to serve me this crap.

The one-item combo came with tom yum soup, which did not taste authentic at all, as well as a side of rice. My drunken noodle dish was beyond spicy! I know it was stated on the menu as such, but our server did not make sure I was aware when she took my order, nor did she ask if I would like it to be more mild. Also, the service was extremely slow for how empty the restaurant was. She did not ask what we would like to drink; instead, she asked as an afterthought when taking our orders. None of the servers looked our way during the meal either. It took me awhile to flag our server down for more water and to have them send over the forgotten house salad that came with our family friend's meal.\n\nParking was surprisingly decent; everyone was probably flooding the Chinese restaurants on Noriega or Irving.

Especially for a group of 15+ in SF. This restaurant was very close to where we rented a house for the weekend. We actually didn't have much of a selection in terms of delivery. \n\nLet me tell you, it was quite a process to use the YelpEats24 App for a large party. I would recommend to place a phone order instead and here's why. \n\n1. Some items they offered were not on the app. This delayed our order. I had to ask my friends to order items from the app after we realized this.\n\n2. Write orders down first instead of plugging it in the app. It had been over 45 minutes by the time I was able to grab and enter everyone's order and double check them. We almost lost our order!! \n\nOne of my friends wanted to use her credit card after I had plugged everything into my phone through my yelp app. When I entered her name and credit card information under my yelp app, it prompted me to re-log into my yelp acct. I lost our order when I did so. Luckily, my Samsung S7 Edge had a back button. Somehow I was able to place the order under guest, instead of logging into my yelp account.\n\n3. It took another hour for the order to arrive. We put in 15% tip on top of the total bill of over $145. On top of the SF Health Mandate Tax. Perhaps we should've paid cash for tip. We did not receive extra napkins under special request. In fact, we didn't receive any napkins or utensils. Maybe we didn't put enough tip??\n\nOn with the food:\n\nIn my opinion, it was mediocre. Well my Tom Kha Goong Soup was not prepared right. It is quite tricky to prepare coconut milk soup. When prepared right, there's a noticeable separation in the coconut milk, with lemongrass and other spices added, the flavors are truly harmonious and this takes time. What I received tasted like sweetened milk with no hint of  lemongrass or other spices. I ate all my shrimps. It was clear that not enough time was put into my soup. I do judge Thai Restaurants by how well they prepare this dish. \n\nIf you're still reading this review, you might be thinking this review sounds more like a 2 star review. I bumped it up because two of my friends enjoyed their eggplant dishes. One even mentioned it was the best she ever had but she mentioned this after she finished her dish. I was not able to confirm, however she did finish it.\n\nThai bbq chicken was a bit on the dry side, mentioned by the one who ordered it. One mentioned the pad thai was too sweet but we had three orders for it. The rest of the dishes ordered had no complaints. From what I can remember, we also ordered pineapple fried rice, a couple of non-coconut milk soups, red curry, chicken satay and couple of Thai Iced Teas. \n\nFyi, usually rice is an additional fee at Thai Restaurants but some people have a hard time believing this until their curry dish or soup dish arrives without it. Luckily, some of us ordered and sharing is no big deal in our group.\n\nWe we're all too hangry to take pictures by the time the  food arrived. However, I did snatch one quick photo of my soup I posted under the tips section of this restaurant.", "author": "Yuri K."}

The six of us weren't too hungry, so we ordered four plates to share: Beef Satay, Pad See Ew, Combination Fried Rice, and Green Curry. The beef satay only consisted of four skewers, which is quite minimal but pretty good tasting with the sauce. As for the pad see ew and fried rice were pretty classic, so you can't go wrong with it. Last but not least was the curry, which was quite unique as it was my first time having green curry. If you're into spice and coconut, this is a great option. You also need to order rice with the curry, and as someone has mentioned --make sure to get two orders of rice at least or you'll have a lot of leftover curry.\n\nWith each Yelp check-in, you get a free scoop of coconut ice cream.

When we walked in around 7:30pm there were only one couple inside the restaurant. We hesitated to go in but it was getting late so we decided to give it a try. We've ordered the Pork Thai Fried Rice, Grilled beef and Seafood Eggplant. The portion was so small. The seafood was stale and nasty. The Grilled beef was cold. The food was so bland and greasy. This place is so over price. When we were driving home, we both had a stomach ache. We almost did not  make it home in time to use the bathroom. Boy did we both had diarrhea. We both felt so sick to our stomach. Hopefully we won't end up in the ER tonight. This is the WORST thai restaurant we ever been too. Think the Health Department needs to be called in to check on their kitchen and their cleanliness. Boy this is the worst experience we have ever been to. We should have known better not to go in when we only saw one couple in the restaurant especially on a Saturday night.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

First, it was a takeout and they did not give any sort of utensils or napkins. Second, the duck basil dish....literally had 2 pieces of duck in it.

It's decent Thai food, nothing great - and definitely nothing that justifies the rude employees that work there. My fianc\u00e9 and I usually pick up our orders , but the last time we picked up food the employees were talking about us negatively, in their native tongue (non English), and likely didn't realize that my fianc\u00e9 understood what they were saying. \n\nIt's been a little while since we ordered from them again due to this poor experience, so decided to get delivery thinking it would be better. Wrong! The guy delivering the food was another rude employee. When I opened my front door, the delivery guy hands me the bag of food and immediately says 'whoever ordered this didn't include a tip'...this is super rude. I ordered the food online and since I've worked in the food industry for yrs, I always tip cash. So for this guy to just call out there was no tip, as if he was entitled to a tip was completely poor judgment. I gave him the cash that I already had in my hand and told him to have a good night. \n\nBottom line.

It is a small place and upon walking in, there were about six tables with people dining in. I walked to the back and picked up my order.\n\nNo disposable silverware or napkins were provided in my take out bag, which annoyed me. I guess you have to request for that? \n\nPineapple Fried Rice: This was very bland. Huge chunks of pineapple but I only counted five pieces. Three small shrimps. Maybe two and a half ounces of chicken. It lacked any kind of spice or dominating flavor. Probably the saddest thai style fried rice I had ever consumed. \n\nPad Thai Pak: All the noodles stuck together in a huge clump. Plain noodles in the center where the sauce had not penetrated. A good 15% of the dish was composed of bean sprouts. Being a veggie dish, I only counted 2 small sad pieces of broccoli. I threw most of this dish away.\n\nSpicy Eggplant Tofu: I think they messed up my order and only served me the just the spicy tofu , because this dish did not contain any eggplant whatsoever. It was also the most flavorful dish of the three with a spicy sweet and sour sauce. I actually poured this sauce onto my fried rice to give that life. Still it's fried tofu so you can't really screw that up-\n\nOverall this was not food made with any passion.

We used to come here alot since we live a few blocks away. Last friday, me and two friends came in on a friday at 7:10pm and ordered our food. We knew something was wrong when the waitress insisted on us ordering something to drink when we said we were ready to order our food. \n\nWe got three dishes, Pineapple Fried rice, Pad See Ew, and Chicken Curry Noodles. Our friend's Pineapple Fried Rice came 25 minutes after ordering. The two noodle dishes never came until we got up and left at 7:55pm. We waited over 45 minutes at this establishment for our food. We asked two different waitresses where our food was, and they said it's coming. When one of us said, \"we're leaving\" the waitress had the gal to say that our food was cooking in the back. After telling us that, 10 minutes the food still hadn't come out and so we said we weren't paying for the unserved dishes and demanded our check come in right there and then. \n\nWe also watched people come in, order, eat, and pay for the check well after we came in. There was an elderly couple next to us who stated that they got the wrong dishes, but the waitress bullied them into believing that those were the dishes they ordered. Also no less than 5 take-out orders were given before our friend's plate was given.\n\nAs we left they handed us our noodles and said that they were sorry. Too little too late. To give a time table on how quickly I can actually make those noodle dishes, is 10 minutes. I'm not a cook by any means, but Pad See Ew only takes a few minutes to make. The curry chicken only needs the curry powder and noodles and takes even less time to make. All in all, the people running the place last friday don't know how to run a restaurant. \n\nI'm never coming back here again.", "author": "Clinton L."}

After a long day, stopped off here to get my usual order and a side of steamed rice to go.  Got it home and when I dumped the box of steamed rice out onto a proper plate, there was all kinds of dark, odd foreign objects disbursed throughout my box of, what should have been clean white, steamed rice.\n\nAlmost went back, but I think it's quite obvious what has happened here.  For decades, I've heard nasty rumors about asian restaurants re-using old leftover rice from tables and have always tried to put it to the back of my mind.  Not sure if that's what happened here or if someone used a dirty spatula to put it into the box, but the damage is done.  I initially tried isolating the offending bad part, but got pissed off that it was so nicely distributed throughout the whole box.  \n\nNot sure what happened...not sure I really want to know.  Anyway, I took a bunch of pictures and posted a couple here in the photo section.  BTW, as you might notice, the amount of rice on the plate, relative to the box is quite less...the reason is that I got so mad that I started throwing away the worst parts before I realized I should take a picture.  Regardless, these pictures should suffice.\n\nIn all fairness, I guess I could have gone back and they probably would have replaced it, but to be honest, why should I?  Why should I have to drive allllllll the way back there and also why should I even have to deal with this BS?  Once the trust is violated, I see no point in ever going back.\n\nBought a replacement box of steamed white rice to use as an accompaniment from another restaurant in another neighborhood close to home.  It may have been cheap, low grade rice, but it was hot, fresh, white, and clean...hell, it was like the Cadillac of white steamed rice tonight after the other rice that I got at Vanida.\n\nFood didn't quite taste the same tonight either.  Front staff was different from who we usually see too...did they sell the place?  I have no idea.

The taste is nothing extraordinary. The portions for the entrees in this place are small, however, which makes the average price seem like a fortune.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing, but my entree was very stingy. Ordered the garlic shrimp and out comes a plate covered in a bed of lettuce and on top are 9 (yes, I counted) shrimp tossed with some garlic sauce. And these weren't big shrimp, but the size of shrimp that are served in bulk at buffets. This comes down to $1 a shrimp for this entree!\n\nGreat staff, but not worth the price.

The gal was very friends and polite. When I finally tried the drunken noodles there was a strange alight sour odor. Wasn't sure exactly what it was and the over all dish seems really pale/light.

There was an unusually generous portion of duck in the curry and every bite of the fatty meat was delectable.

The surrounding area is generally residential so just drive around and you'll be able to find some parking. I picked up: \n\n- Tom Yum Gai: A let down! The soup had all the right tom yum fixins but it lacked that sour heat element. I like tom yum soup that makes my mouth pucker and no puckering here.\n\n- Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) with beef: Delicious. The noodles were a bit thinner than those I've had in pad kee mao dishes but the flavor was spot on. \n\n- Garlic Pork: They nailed the garlic flavor. The meat is tender and the Vanida green sauce is like a Thai chimichurri. It's herby, citrusy, salty, a little sweet and with some spiciness. It's the bombdotcom, and trust, I was dipping my beef from the pad kee mao into the sauce. \n\n- Duck Curry: The curry was flavorful and had a good spice level.

My girlfriend and I have lived in San Fran for about 3 years, and we have been ordering from Vanida occasionally, totalling about a couple dozen times. The food is good, the delivery time is reasonable. \n\nFor my birthday, we decided to get Vanida for delivery. We ordered two curries, one mild and one medium spicy. We also ordered drunken noodle, which is not supposed to be spicy at all. There was no indication on the menu that it was spicy. We also ordered the drunken noodle from their restaurant several times before, and it was never spicy. When we got the food, EVERYTHING WAS LAVA HOT SPICY. My girlfriend and I like spicy food, so spicy is not normally a problem for us. But our friend could not eat spicy at all, and she was the one who ordered the drunken noodle. We could not even eat the drunken noodle, it was pure fire.\n\nOf course we call to complain since our friend could not even eat the food that she paid for. The staff was extremely unapologetic. I believe they said, \"Other people ordered these dishes, and they didnt complain it was too spicy!\" After talking for a couple minutes (really arguing and defending), they finally redelivered the food about an hour later... with the condition that we return all the previous food that was too spicy. The delivery driver was also on the band wagon that it was all our fault. When he delivered the food, he insisted that \"next time, ask for not spicy at all\".\n\nSo remember Vanida customers: If you do not want your food to be inedibly spicy, you MUST ask for non spicy. Even if you like spicy food normally. Even if you the menu says that it is not spicy. Even if you had ordered it several time before and it was not spicy.\n\nI worked in a restuarant for seven years, so I know the standard operating procedure when it comes to dealing with customer complaints. The way that they got so butt hurt about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). Will not be ordering from them again (good job Vanida!)", "author": "Neville B."}

Yes, parking is always a problem here as is anywhere else in the city. The inside is colorfully decorated with lots of things to look at. I always love looking at the things hung up in restaurants. Guilty pleasure perhaps?\n\nWe were seated right away. I was surprised that it wasn't that busy on a Friday night, but that's okay since I was hungry! Our waiter was very nice and helpful to some of the people in my group who hadn't eaten Thai food before. However, there was a waitress there who seemed really irritated with every little question we asked her. (Rolling eyes, just a very 'I don't want to be here' attitude, etc) \n\nThe food here was good Thai food. I tried a little bit of everything: pad thai, baby corn chicken, eggplant something??, yellow curry, and sticky rice with mango. Wasn't disappointed at all; it was all really good! The pad thai was a little drier than I've had before, but it wasn't that big of a change to make me not like it. The sticky rice and mango was a delight! Such a refreshing dessert, hands down one of my favorites. At Vanida, it was decent as in it hit the spot and I was satisfied but not the best I've ever had. \n\nOverall, other than that one waitress, it was good dining experience.", "author": "Priyam D."}

We Yelped this place before hand, and it seemed to be a relatively good place, however we were quite disappointed with our experience! \n\nWe arrived around 6pm on a Tuesday, with only 2 other parties there, just before the dinner crowd. The decor is very cute, ethnic paintings are displayed on a burgandy and cream wall. \n\nI ordered the Pad Thai and substituted the prawns for beef, and requested it to be \"medium-spicy\" and an iced Thai tea. My friend ordered the Pad Thai (as is) and the Yellow Curry with chicken. By now, almost all of the tables in the restuarant were full! \n\nMy Pad Thai was eloquantly garnished, however the taste was underwhelming. It was under-seasoned, and needed more salt. I was very disappointed that there was no spiciness at all whatsoever. My friend agreed that the Pad Thai wasn't the best, however I must say that the Yellow Curry was flavorul and spicy. \n\nAs for the prices for dinner, I was very surprised how small the portion was for the price! The Pad Thai was $7.95 and the curry was $7.78. NOTE: the curry does not come with rice!!!! You must purchase rice on the side for $1.25 per person! I found that to be very odd, usually curry comes with some rice on the side. \n\nOverall, I had high hopes for this place, however was very disappointed with the quality and quantity of food provided. For a $10 dinner, I could have gone to Panda Express and ordered much more food! \n\ntl;dr - If you're going to order a curry dish, you need to purchase rice on the side!

It put me off a little to watch him get large ice chunks from a bag of ice (the type you buy from a grocery store), and fill it to the rim with ice. It always leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see so much ice put into a drink. Oh well. When he brought them to our table, my bf got stuck with a large iceberg piece of ice floating in his drink. The drinks looked lighter than usual (perhaps all the ice?), but taste wise it was alright. I've had better thai teas.\n\nNow onto the meal...Whenever I go to any Thai restaurant I find myself ordering the same Pad kee mao (with chicken or shrimp). I was a bit disappointed to see my plate set in front of me. I thought the portion was small, despite knowing it was a \"lunch menu item\". However, by the end of the meal I clearly had a case of \"eyes bigger than my stomach\" and I was filled, which my bf eating the leftover. The taste was yummy, so I was pleased with that. I thought this dish was reasonably priced.\n\nBoyfriend had some two item combo with garlic shrimp and tofu with peanut sauce. I can see why he likes this place. The garlic shrimp was great, and the tofu as well, however the portions seemed kinda small and I don't see how it could have filled my voracious eater of a bf.\n\nOn a happy note, they gave us a complimentary dessert of sticky rice and mango (maybe cause the bf knows the owner who wasn't there?).

The service sucked, it took a while before we were seated and then once we were seated it even took more time.  Once our food got to the table the server hurried to serve the soup . . . spilling and clanking dishes around.  Out of all the dishes the soup was the best.  The yellow curry was rather sweet and not so curryish, the fish cakes were okay, nothing special, and the Pad Thai was good but nothing that really hit me. Overall the service sucked and the food was just okay. I was quite disappointed esp. checking out the Yelp reviews. I Won't be back.", "author": "D M."}

Not overwhelmingly sweet nor too creamy. At $2, it's cheaper than most other restaurants.\n\nI chose tom yum (hot and sour soup) with my meal and it was alright. Instead of getting chicken I got vegetable tom yum so I found out that they put the vegetables in the soup base instead of having a separate pot of vegetable tom yum and chicken tom yum. The vegetables in the soup were crunchy which I can see why people may not like it, but I'd rather have fresh slightly crisp vegetables than soft vegetables that lost all of their flavor and nutrition. The soup wasn't very spicy, just okay. \n\nThe curry tasted just like my mom's. I should add that she's from Thailand. A+! Unlike King of Thai, Vanida's has a less viscous curry with more coconut milk. It's more homemade and has simple flavors than all the stuff wt King of Thai I have no idea what they put in it. There's lots of chicken and just the right amount of rice on the side. The only downside was that the rice was really moist. Usually I like rice a little sticky, but with curry dryer rice soaks up the curry better. However I'd rather have the rice moist than dry and thinking that it's old. \n\nAdditional info: One of the workers/owners is really funny. He loves singing.

But I won't dock them because, luckily, there was a sheet on the front for chef's favorites. So I took one of those -  the lamb curry. It was not very good. The lamb was hard and chewy. It was really more like a soup than a solid meal. And honestly, I felt like it shouldn't have been an entree. It would be a great side dish, but on it's own it was just not something you'd want to eat a whole meal of. \n\nI think I may have just made the wrong decision.

Afterward, she treated me to lunch at Vanida Thai Kitchen. \n\nI have not been to a Thai restaurant in quite a while. There are so many restaurants to choose from these days that none seem very special to me, not even the local restaurant in my own neighborhood. So I was not expecting much at this outer Sunset location.\n\nWe selected from their lunch combination menu. I had the garlic pork and vegetable green curry with white rice. My aunt ordered the Gai Yang (marinated broiled chicken) and Poh-Pia J (deep fried spring rolls). Our lunch included steamed rice and our choice of soups or salad. We both chose soup. I had vegetable Tom Yum, my aunt had chicken Tom Kha. I also had their Thai iced tea. \n\nThe iced tea was nice, not syrupy or too sweet. The food was fresh and delicious. The Tom Yum was nicely balanced with the salt/sweet/sour. The only thing I felt it lacked was a bit of heat - it was quite mild.\n\nMy garlic pork had a nice char and was quite tasty. There was a green dipping sauce that tasted of vinegar, mint and cilantro - very herby. The vegetable green curry had a bit of heat to it, but still mild by my standards. Maybe I could have ordered it a little spicier, but they didn't offer and I didn't inquire.\n\nI had a bite of one of my Aunt's spring rolls. It was made well, the spring roll skin had a nice crunch and was not greasy. But the filling could have been seasoned a little bit more, I thought it was a touch bland for my taste. But maybe that's what the dipping sauce is for. I finished my curry and took home the rest of my pork to enjoy later.\n\nTheir prices are very reasonable and they have generous portions. Our wait person was friendly and efficient, the dining room is clean and comfortable. Judging from the other reviews, it appears to be a popular place for take away in the neighborhood. The next time I head to the Sunset to help my Aunt out with errands and she says \"let's get something to eat\", I'd definitely suggest going back to Vanida.", "author": "IM M."}

I don't know about that, but I do know the duck curry was delicious.  Pad Thai was serviceable, but then, I'm not a huge fan of it so you should try it for yourself.

The place is decorated with many warm colors and a Thai theme without going overboard.  I came here with a friend and they seated the two of us at a 4 person table, which is better for dinner than the \"two person\" tables.  I would recommend this place for a relaxed night or a date.\n\nWe had roti which came with a sweet cucumber salad and a yellow curry paste, the eggplant and pork, and the yellow curry with jasmine rice.  Everything was delicious.  I Especially like sweet things, so I really enjoyed the cucumber salad that came with the roti appetizer.  The eggplant was just right, not to mushy, not to raw, and the accompanying pork not too dry and full of flavor.  I would have liked a little more sweetness and coconut flavor in the curry, but this is personal preference and the curry was still good as prepared.  The appetizer and two dishes was more than enough to fill two females and we had extras to take home.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, although I felt they checked on us a little too often.  Perhaps this is because we were there at a time when the place wasn't too busy? We came on a Tuesday night.  Regardless, they made sure that we were enjoying our food and would come by very often to remove empty plates and refill our water.  It was a bit awkward though that we were often not finished with a plate before they came to remove it.  This probably wouldn't be a problem for people who don't finish their food to the last drop.\n\nIn summary, this is a great place for good food, friendly staff, and a pleasant ambiance.", "author": "Stella T."}

I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a thai place deep in the avenues with great reviews. I knew about the block it was on, but I guess I just get distracted with the other chinese restaurants next to it.\n\nRegardless, this place was pretty damn good. We got there around 9:45 - close to their closing time - so we decided to order takeout after sitting at a table. They were accommodating enough and let us sit there with water while we waited. \n\nI ordered the pad thai pak and really enjoyed it. I'm  usually a carnivore but I LOVED this dish. Usually, when you order a veggie dish at a restaurant, it comes with one or two different types of veggies, but this dish had at least four or five. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, not too soggy nor too undercooked; it had the perfect crunch and it absorbed the right amount of flavor. I rarely find veggie dishes this satiating, but I could eat this dish all day.\n\nThe boy got pad see ew. We practically order this dish at any thai restaurant we go to - it's like a test for the restaurant. The dish came out flavorful but not super greasy like other places (ahem King of Thai). The chicken was cooked well, not overdone and still tender. There was a great ratio of veggies:meat:noodles. Personally, I might not order this dish but it's definitely a lot better than other places' pad see ew.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great - something unexpected after seeing the atmospheres of the surrounding restaurants (North Beach Pizza, Wing's). Overall, this is a great restaurant and they deliver too! I'll have to try the lunch special, seems like a great deal.", "author": "Christina B."}

This place is great for anyone, but not those who seek authenticity. But Vanida did not mention anything about authentic Thai cuisine, so good for them. Okay, lets start with what we had for dinner.\nSeafood salad- It was good, I actually did like this dish.\n\nPapaya salad- Okay, we made a request for the papaya salad, we wanted it to be the dirty style with all the black goodness and fishyness. Right when we mention that request the waitress jumped back and said we don't do that here, as if we ask her is they sold cocaine in the back. So we settled for their regular salad and asked for SPICY, but when the dish came out it was sweet at first and maybe a tiny kick at the end of the bite. When we want spicy and when we say SPICY, we expect to be dripping sweat and scratching our heads.\n\nTom Kha soup- Too much coconut milk, almost tasted like a dessert. \n\nAngel wings- okay someone specify what Angel wings are, because in every Thai restaurant it is different. Some places it is stuffed chicken wings and here it is just fried wings tossed in a mild honey basil sauce. But it was good!\n\nPad kee mao and Pad see ew- were rated okay!!\n\noverall this place is nice, food is beautifully presented, taste varies on what you think Thai food should taste like.

At the end of dinner we ordered sticky rice with mango, which was a perfect amount of subtle sweetness. The entire bill for all these items including steamed rice was $40!

Their Tom Yum isn't as good as King of Thai (but only because the broth is not as rich and spicy).  We also love their sweet potato fries and yellow curry.  \n\nYou should definitely go here for a quiet night out or get take-out or delivery for a quiet night in =).", "author": "Ashley S."}

I had the worst Pad Thai I have ever had, literally. I love ALL Pad Thai and I would not even have a second taste of it, even after I had to send it back because I asked for the vegetarian version and mine came with prawns, yet was still charged the extra $1.00 for the prawns (!)  I guess you could say their lunch special is a good deal, but if that means the curries were good, that isn't a great measure as curries are always good, they are almost impossible to get wrong!

I don't know their overall opinions, but I thought it was just okay.  \n\nI had one of the specials on the board, Ginger Salmon, which essentially was over-cooked salmon messily mixed in with 3 kinds of mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and long strips of ginger, flooded with a rather bland sauce.  When I say mixed in, I mean it, the presentation was very messy, although the taste was okay, nothing special.\n\nI also had a bite of my date's Pad See Yew, but it was pretty bland, the only saving grace in my opinion was the perfectly cooked, crunch chinese broccoli.  He did say he thought it was a bit sweet.\n\nI also tried the \"sauce\" from the Garlic Prawns, and I haven't figured out how a sauce made of garlic, pepper and cilantro can be so bland.  And, speaking of bland, another friend got the Combo Noodle Soup, which looked like pho, but apparently didn't have much flavor, he said it was pretty bland, but okay.  The last friend got the Squid Salad, which he said was also okay, but he'd had better.\n\nThe Hot Thai Tea was nice, basically the same thing in the Thai Iced Tea, but without the condensed milk.\n\nI should mention that service was nice, pretty relaxed but attentive.  Our water and tea would usually get topped off when half was gone.  The only glitch was that we were not eating family style, but all of our dishes came out seperately, about 10+ minutes between the first and last dish to arrive.\n\nWas Vanida good?  To use the same thing throughout my review, it was okay.  Will I go to Vanida again? Probably not, even if I'm in the area.", "author": "Crystal B."}

The sauce was so good that I ate the spinach!!! :D\n\nI've had the pad thai, and I approve! It is veeery very good. Don't wait too long to eat it if you get takeout though. The noodles will start to stick together. The one time I came with the boyfriend, we decided to try to curry. It was the curry with duck I believe. It was awesome! Usually, I'm not a big fan of curry unless they're curry fish balls. I love curry fish balls. I really liked the duck though. It wasn't too spicy, but it had a nice kick.

Essentially the way I describe it is \"the essence of the flavor in the smell of the food,\" (Sounded a bit like Confucius there). And basically the way you experience it is, when one eats, one breathes, either through his or her mouth or through their nose. So when eating, with food in your mouth, especially when the food is piping-fresh-from-the-wok hot, you inhale through your mouth slightly to cool the food down. Well the scent from the food, travels to the back of your mouth, and some of it goes up into your olfactory sensors. And you know how they say that 80% of the taste of food is in its scent. That's where you get the essence!\n\nOk Biology lesson aside, yeah the Pad Kee Mao is hit or miss.

I went here alone one day for lunch and it was pretty decent.

He got Cashew chicken, which was tasty but greasy, I mean like orange rainbows all over the bottom of the plate, all pooling up, staring back at us like an ocean of shame and despair.  Shucks.  I got red curry with tofu and chicken and not only was it NOT spicy, it was totally bland.  Completely bogus, I was really pulling for this little place.\n\nInsult to injury came when the bill read $6.00 for brown rice.  Double you tee eff?  SRSLY?  \n\nSo, you tell me... if you have THIS exchange with your waitress:\n\n- would you like white rice?\n- do you have brown rice?\n- yes.\n- okay, we'll have brown rice.\n\nAre you going to be expecting a six DOLLAR charge for it?\n\nNeedless to say, it's tempting to leave an embarrassingly small tip when something like that happens.

Anything else go ahead and eat here if you like. \n\nI went here based on the yelp ratings but I should have read multiple reviews further down. My family and I went here late on a Saturday night and the place was dead. I thought to myself \"score\". I have been to Thailand which doesn't make me a Thai food expert but I know what's good at least. BTW in Thailand, Thai food is just called food and Thai tea is just tea. They also had a picture of the king and queen on the back wall, the Thais love their royalty so I thought I was in the right place.  \n\nWe sat down immediately and questioned the waitress about the menu. She was the nicest person. We first asked about the papaya salad in which my wife had a craving for. Come to learn that it was the water down 'American' version and they did not have the ingredients to create the original Thai version, which if you're white and still reading this, order it this way, It will change your life, kind of like reading Fight Club or V for Vendetta. First rule of ordering papaya salad, order authentic. So no go on the original and she seemed to be offended that we would ask for something so horrific but in her nice way.  Then we asked for it spicy. No questions about spicyness but I think spicyness is really subjective because my level 4 spicy and your level 2 spicy is probably the same thing. She didn't ask what level like how some restaurants ask but she should know spicy. When she placed the order my over heard the waitress and the cook confirming the level of heat in the dish. We also had the angle wings and tom ka coconut soup. The wings come to find out are just wings. Every Thai place I have ever been to stuff their angle wings with some kind of chicken concoction and deep fry the crap of it. The Thais love their deep frying methods and I love them for this. But this was plain wings. When the papaya salad came out it was spicy at all. Again a water down interpretation of the salad revered by the people who created their own version of donkey show which includes a ping pong. \n\nThe tom ka soup had to much coconut it which made it too creamy and was almost a dessert soup. Weird I know. And it used too many onions as a filler making seem like the soup was more hearty than it actually was. I hate large slivers of onion in anything. Someone else made the same comment but it was too late. I gave them a 3 out of 5 because the quality of the food was great and the wait staff was attentive and really nice. \n\nI'm glad to see that no where do they refer to their food as authentic because it is not and they need to take down the picture of the king and queen because if they came to eat here, he would slap her for not going on Yelp and reading my review. If you like to be catered to by really nice people but could care less about having mediocre food, this is the place to go. If you want to have good food by the worse people then go to king of Thai noodles. I hate King of Thai Noodles but their food is so delicious! Damn you insensitive artisans", "author": "Paul T."}

We decided to try most of the nights special displayed on the board in the back wall.  They had an appetizer combo special and pumpkin curry with chicken special.\n\nThe soup we ordered really threw us for a loop.  I ordered the creamy corn soup, which I thought was going to be brothy.  In fact, the soup was sweet and heavy on tofu; very much resembling the chinese dessert, dofu fa. So, the soup was quite peculiar to start off our meal.\n\nThen came the combo appetizer platter consisting of egg rolls, shrimp rolls, curry puffs and fish cakes.  It was nice that they had a different dipping sauce to accompany each item.  But none of the appetizers really stood out.\n\nFor our main course we got the pumpkin curry and Nuer Yang (BBQ ), charbroiled marinated beef; served with Vanida green sauce.  The pumpkin curry was a little too runny.  It was spicy and had a kick to it though.  The curry was actually better the next day.  I thickened it up a bit and added some heavy cream.... yum.  Now, that was good stuff.\n\nThe beef was really tough and chewy.  For some reason I haven't had much luck with grilled meat at Thai restaurants so far.\n\nBased on the reviews for this place, we probably hit Vanida on an off night and probably ordered the wrong items.

It's really close to my house, so I kind of have no choice when I have nothing to eat... Haha.\n\nWell, the ambiance of this place is very nice. It's nice and cozy in this place. Definitely a plus.\n\nThe service here is okay/ pretty good. When I come in to get take out, they always greet me really nice. But sometimes, they seem a bit off. Yesterday, I came in during lunchtime, and the waitress, though very nice, seemed quite nervous. Her smile was a bit off and a little fake... But the service otherwise is good. A while back, I came in for lunch and I wasn't feeling all that great. I was a little sick, and when I couldn't finish my food, the waitress asked if there was anything wrong with the food and if I was okay. i felt like that was a bold move and I considered it good customer service. Also, when I ask for their opinion on what to get, they are very honest on what they recommend and don't, which is another plus.\n\nAnyways, the food here is pretty good. I consider this restaurant a little fancier than most Thai restaurants.\n\nYesterday, I got the lunch special. The special includes one ($6.50) or two ($7.50) picks of entrees, a big scoop of rice, and your choice of soup or salad. I ordered two things: Pad Thai (+$1) & Red Curry with Beef. I also get the Tom Yum here, so I decided to get the Tom Kha Gai (coconut milk soup) I also had a Thai Iced Tea. The first thing that came was the Thai Iced Tea. This place has, arguably, the best Thai Iced Tea. The soup came next, and I was surprised. I usually dislike things that have coconut in it, but the soup was amazingly good. The chicken in the soup melted in my mouth. The whole entree came next. The Pad Thai didn't have much flavor. I didn't enjoy it that much. But the Red Curry was delicious. It had beef, zucchini, string beans, bamboos, and basil. It was a little spicy, which I like a lot. I expected the beef to be overcooked, but it was soft and tender, which made the meal pretty good.\n\nI've had many other things here. Fish cakes, Garlic Pork, and BBQ Chicken are all really good. I've also had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup, which is very good also. The calamari and Pad See Ew are things I'd skip. They're both OKAY, but nothing special. And the one complaint I have about all these dishes? The portions are kinda small and the price is a little more than other Thai places. When I ate the Tom Yum Noodle Soup, I drank it down til there was not a drop left of it, and I felt like I ate almost nothing... I mean, c'mon...\n\nOverall, I really like this place. I will come back here time after time to try more things, but I really think they need to have bigger portions. I think it's only fully worth it during lunchtime. And when they do give big portions, I'll give them a full 4 stars.", "author": "Derek T."}

Yam fried in cocoa butter - not on my diet, but very tasty! \nI ordered the duck curry with brown rice, and was thrilled at the medium spicy taste. The duck was tender for the most part, and the veggies seemed fresh. The by-the-glass merlot was reasonable. \nMy bf ordered the Nuer Beef, that came with a green sauce that went amazingly well with the pineapple chunks from my curry. The beef was tender overall, and well cooked. \nThey offer an unsweetened Thai Iced Tea, which is on my list to try next time.\nPresentation was lovely on square and trapezoidal service. \nThe acoustics are, well, let's just say you should keep your voice down if you want to have a private conversation. The smooth ceiling bounces every sound across the room. \nA table of biologists chatted about turtles and manatee across from us, and a couple of regulars ate quietly. I'm not sure what the couple next to us did, but they refused a free entree from the staff laughingly saying, \"You gave us a free one last time. We WANT to pay!\" \nThe impression overall was that the hipster grandkids of the original owners have redone the place and contemporized it. Still feels family, but everyone behind the counter was under 30, and the music was a local radio station playing what is probably called 'adult contemporary.'\nThe dinner prices are very reasonable.

Luckily, I remembered that my friend from work has a restaurant - well, his parents have a restaurant - and I thought it would impress my uncle, who is always upstaging me with stories of his latest exploits with Jack Johnson (yes, THE Jack Johnson.)  Now,  of course, on a par with knowing a famous singer/guitarist, having a friend whose parents own a good Thai restaurant is, well, not much to brag about. Still, thanks to Vanida Thai Kitchen, I feel somewhat redeemed.  We had an excellent dinner in a relaxed, yet stylish setting; and, the staff/owners were extremely accomodating and hospitable. \n\nOf course, I am willing to admit that some of the royal treatment was owing to my friendship with the owners' son, but collegial kindness notwithstanding, the food was excellent, the service was friendly, and the location exactly what was needed for this occasion. There were five of us adults and one baby, and so the restaurant boasted the perfect combination of style and relaxation that is needed when dining out with a little tyke. They even brought us a baby spoon to share the dessert! \n\nAs it was some time ago, I don't recall exactly what we ordered, but I know we did have some chicken satay, curries, Thai beer, dessert, and pad Thai. As I've stated in other reviews, I am in no way an expert on Thai cuisine, but when the experience is pleasant and the food is good, that is enough for me to be happy. Oh, and the price was extremely reasonable for the size of our party.\n\nIt may be out of the way to trek all the way out to the end of the city to come here, but there is always parking, and of course the Muni. Or with the money you save by not eating at an overpriced \"Thai\" restaurant on, say, Fillmore street, you might even have money to take a taxi home.  My uncle and aunt, who were initially a bit confused by the location ( as visitors to the city, they were surprised that it was in such an out-of-the-way place) but they did end up enjoying the meal. It may not be on par with having a rock star be your friend, but hey, at least you know that you can have a good meal in a nice restaurant that is owned by people you know!", "author": "eliz s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-28", "description": "I've walk by Vanida Thai Kitchen every day on my way home from work and I've been eager to try it for a while now.  My recent new found love for Thai food finally got me to try Vanida last night.  I ordered a few dishes because the prices were decent and I wanted to try different tastes to get a more tested feel for the restaurant.  \n\nI started with the Spring Rolls.  These were great because they were free!  Any order over $20, you get a free order of Spring Rolls.  They were nice and crispy but I didn't care very much for the accompanying sauce.  Being a spicy fiend, I ended up using the chili sauce for my spring rolls, which did the trick.  I was pretty satisfied with the mix of flavorful vegetables along with the oily and crispy outer shell.\n\nMy next appetizer was the Angel Wings, in which I was thoroughly dissatisfied with.  I suppose I was spoiled by being recently introduced to the angel wings at Marnee Thai, which puts all other chicken wings to shame.  The angel wings at Vanida were comparatively pretty puny and not very crispy.  I only ate 3 of the 10 or so.\n\nOne of my staples when I have Thai is Pad See Eww (I'm not quite sure how to spell it, it seems like it's spelled differently at every restaurant!)  Like the Angel Wings I wasn't impressed with this dish.  Compared to Osha Thai and Marnee, Vanida's Pad See Eww tasted rather bland and unremarkable.  I'm not saying it tasted bad per say, it just didn't overwhelm me with a plethora of amazing spices and flavors like the other two restaurants I mentioned.\n\nMy last dish was green curry with shrimp which did justice for the disappointing angel wings and Pad See Eww.  The curry was a little thin, not much body to it, but it had a wonderful flavor.  It gave off a nice kick (I ordered it spicy) and definitely made me want to keep eating, although I was full.  \n\nSo I had two good dishes and two not so good dishes at Vanida Thai Kitchen.  The prices were very cheap compared to other Thai restaurants I've tried, and the free spring rolls were definitely a great treat.  I'm giving it three stars, however they're really close to four.  I will assuredly eat there again; perhaps another decent experience will give it the extra bump for an additional star.", "author": "Timothy C."}

The restaurant looked very nice from the outside, much like a 4 star place. The interior feels very Thai-like with the colors they picked out with the red and cream colored walls. They also have plants scattered throughout the shop which is a nice little touch. I like how they made the counter near the kitchen into a tiki style bar. I went in for lunch and they had a bunch of lunch specials for under $8, steal! I opted for the yellow curry with chicken and garlic pork. The lunch specials also came with a choice of soup or salad and I got the hot and sour soup. It was not that great, it pretty much tasted like flavored water. The food came out reasonably quick and it was delish. The curry was perfect, it had great flavor and not too spicy. The curry also had good texture where it was not too watery or too thick.The garlic pork was good too, not too salty or sweet. The portion size was pretty filling for the price. Overall, the quality of food here is definitely worth the price. I only docked off a star for the soup otherwise this place is highly recommended.

We kept it simple and ordered three pad thais, three cocanut/shrimp soups, and plain white rice for two.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we were charged about $49 for the order. The price seemed rather high...especially as the food was mostly cheap noodles and rice, but I didn't raise the point to the driver. Instead I referenced one of the many Vanida Thai menus we have as well as their current online menu. What I found was the the total should have been about $40. I called the restaurant to inquire about the discrepancy, and they said their prices has recently gone up and they hadn't had time to update their online menu. That was over a week ago, and they still have not updated the prices on their menu. How long does it take to update online menu prices....30 minutes at the most.\n\nStrike 1: false advertising\n\n\nNow on to the food. The pad thai was so-so. About the quality of a $4 pad thai plate at a mall food court. The soup was a letdown. First of all, I have no problem with paying $3.75 for a soup, but to pay that and get it in a single 8 oz container is ridiculous. Furthermore, the shrimp in the soup was very dry. In a city like SF...being served what tasted like shrimp which had been frozen for months is not excusable.\n\nStrike 2: tiny portions\nStrike 3: ingredients not fresh\n\n\nFor the life of me, I don't get what people see in Vanida Thai. Unadvertised high prices (probably to pay for their renovation) for small portions of food that is not fresh.\n\nYour far better off at Chaaba...although the parking is much worse there.", "author": "Michael W."}

She always gets the beef noodle soup for the savory broth that reminds her of home (we're actually Taiwanese, but that's irrelevant). I've always been impartial towards meat and poultry so I always get a tofu dish. Their tofu is usually extra firm and triangular, definitely fried. They're really lenient with substituting tofu for meat in any of their dishes, which I love. Their curries are pretty good, although I don't order them as often as I do stir-fried dishes with eggplant. Prices are relatively cheap, and seating is ample. Interior is very clean and modern, same with the restrooms.

It's a bit of a trek for me, but I'd go back - it's like a trip out of town - or if I happened to be in the area. I was impressed by the number and variety of vegetarian appetizers. I had a bit of the spring rolls but was saving room for FBI (fried bananas and ice cream). My vegetables and tofu with peanut sauce were very good, and my dining companion enjoyed his beef dish. The FBI was great! Look carefully between the 3 Chinese restaurants and pizza place to find it.", "author": "Amy E."}

My faves are the marinated bbq chicken and chicken or steamed veggies/tofu pra ram (peanut sauce).  They can get busy in the evening and service can be slow. Their fried rice is good but the onions are ridiculously large in size. I'm not a fan of the pad thai because it taste too much like fish sauce.

Well, the food is still sagging in flair and flavor. Nothing spectacular, I would rather travel the 10 blocks to King of Thai Noodle. The squid salad smelt like the marina, dead fish...don't order it. The Pad Se-Ew was decent, soft and delicate with a nice balance of seasoning, I'd order it again. As yellow curries go this one was average with a bit too much sweetness and too raw of chili.  The most notable theme was the music, a subliminal blend of Madonna and Taylor Dane, took my mind off the stinky squid at the table. The tofu was fresh as was the grilled chicken. I'd go and try something different next time.", "author": "Anthony A."}

It's just simple, family-style Thai food, but the flavors are rich and complex. \n\nIt's a pain to get all the way out there, but worth it.

It could have used more charbroiling but their refreshing (a hint of lime juice?), vinegar-based green sauce really elevated the meat's flavor profile. I had so much leftover rice--they could've plated more pork frankly--that I drenched it with the remaining green sauce and then topped it with the unremarkable Yellow Curry Chicken (#2 lunch; #38 dinner) that I got with the lunch combo. The Tom Kha soup was alright; there was some acidity/sourness found similarly in Tom Yum soup. I also ordered their over-hyped, seven-piece Angel Wings (#12 dinner-appetizer). Sure, I enjoyed the spicy sweet & sour sauce on the wings' skin but the un-marinated chicken wings lacked flavor in the meat and were horribly overcooked and not juicy. Ironically, there appeared to be more meat from this appetizer than the Garlic Pork to fill me up.", "author": "Cliff W."}

We live out by SFSU, and delivery/food in general is a little sketchy after ten years of delivery abundance in the Mission and Haight.  Vanida was, happily, great.  Delivery was relatively quick, prices were decent, and the food was tasty.  BF had the angel wings, which he loved.  We shared vegetarian pad thai, which was very tamarind-y and improved very easily with the (included) squeeze of lime.  All the vegetables were beautiful and very fresh.  I also ordered a red curry which was spicy and flavorful.  Tom kha (coconut milk, lemongrass, ginger) soup was kinda on the sweet side but fantastic the next day when I added my red curry to it.  Thinking on it now I could have added the lime squeeze to that too and probably done away with the sweetness.  In (real) Thai cuisine there is a balance of flavors so possibly I threw off the balance by leaving the lime out.  Either way, yum!  \nI will definitely order from here again.", "author": "nicole p."}
