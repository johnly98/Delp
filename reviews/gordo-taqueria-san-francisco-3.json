After traveling for a while, I am home sick for a little of San Francisco local food. The place comes to my mind because it's a childhood restaurant for me when I studied at Washington High school. There are multiple locations of this shop, but I see them mostly in outer Richmond. \n\nThe super burrito has a gigantic amount of rice, beans, salsa, meat and cheese. I like to add sour cream and Guacamole, but they do come in as an extra charge. The tortilla is freshly steamed before making into the burrito. It's dense enough to keep the burrito from leaking sauces. The taste is fairly light, and that wrap up a very good balance of flavor from the beans, rice, and meat. There are usually a long line for lunch, but the chefs are very quick and skill to make the dishes. I recommend taking the bus here or walk if you live local.", "author": "Vincent Manjin L."}

This particular location is slower than molasses and I've had to wait twenty minutes in a 5 person line to get a burrito that takes literally 30 seconds to make. It's downright kafka-esque. \n\nThe food is very caloric, and hits a certain \"I want to feel stuffed\" craving very well. \n\nHeads up, their guac is literally pur\u00e9e'd avocado with minimal flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-13", "description": "I'll preface this by saying my family of 5 has been going to Gordo's for about 25 years now and I've been going my whole life. Amongst my whole family it's safe to say that we've ordered probably a thousand burritos from Gordo's at its various locations in the last two decades.\n \n One of the great things about Gordo's that we loved was the consistency, the relatively short time to get a burrito, the price, and the location. The only thing that is the same convenience for us is the location. I'll go into detail below.\n \n I don't know why the old burrito makers left, but they've been replaced by a newer, younger worker. This hasn't done them any favors. The consistency of a Gordo's burrito is no longer there, whether it be a ripped tortilla, too much rice and beans and not enough meat, I no longer know what to expect when I open up the the tin foil of a Gordo's burrito I've opened up hundreds of times before.\n \n Another thing I've noticed in the last few months is the fact that they only use one of the two available counters to make burritos. I'm not sure if this is because they do not want to pay for second burrito maker, but it has cost them in long lines that often reach the door of the restaurant. Now fortunately you can order online at this location which I do and I recommend anyone who wants a burrito in a timely matter to do so as well.\n \nNow this probably goes without saying as it's becoming increasingly pricier to live in San Francisco, but they've recently upped the price on a super burritos from about $7 to $10. If my family of five once they each get a burrito for dinner, I've gone from paying $35 to $50. For what you get it's just not worth it for me anymore. It's very unfortunate but it is what it is and I'm happy for others who are able to afford their new prices.\n \n So the location obviously is the same, and that is now my thing about the Taqueria. Living in Pacific Heights, it's much easier to get to get to the Richmond then it is to find a spot somewhere to park in the mission. If someone has any suggestions for a new Taqueria whether it's near me or near Gordo's, please let me know.", "author": "Patrick M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-17", "description": "I've been going to Gordo for over 20 years, frequently or even daily at times.\n\nI think this Gordo used to be better. I'm talking 10 years ago though. Lately the meat is not the quality it used to be. I still find it acceptable, but I often find myself ordering the meatless burrito with Guacamole after numerous disappointments in the past few years. This can also vary by location, I mostly go to the Geary and 19th and Clement and 24th location. This review is specifically for the Geary and 19th location however.\n\nFirst of all the burrito. If you like burritos, you'll probably like this place, especially the guacamole which, most of the time is fresh and tasty. All of the food uses a very high amount of salt in my opinion. The green hot sause is pretty good too if you are into that, but not very spicy (just a little). I'm not going to go into all the food connoisseurs language about how the meat was succulent or the tomatoes were ripe with flavor and had a nice refreshing finish, but overall its good if not great, at the expense of the high sodium factor. I tremendously enjoy the burritos here most of the time (95% or more of the time).\n\nThis particular location has a restroom as well as a handful of tables. If you choose to sit here to eat, there is usually a place to sit without having to wait, and is a comfortable place to have a chat with some friends afterwards for a few minutes without feeling pressured to leave due to it being crowded.\n\nDuring peak times, there is a line, but usually no longer than 15 minutes at the very worst as they have 2 burrito making stations here. You can watch them make the burrito as you customize it to your liking. They will ask you in this order - #1 your order, which they will then prepare by either steaming or otherwise preparing your tortilla(s). After a short pause, they always fill the burrito in this order - beans, rice, meat choice, tomatoes, extras which cost money (guac, sour cream, jalape\u00f1os (free), etc.). They also often have an optional \"red\" hot sauce, but if you don't specify, they will give you \"green\" which I think is better anyway.\n\nGuacamole is a must unless you absolutely cannot stand it. Its also under $1 unlike Chipotle which is $2 or much more.\n\nNow one more thing...\n\nI also have an experience with the douchebag working the register. Granted, this is only one of their staff and other cashiers have been ...average or passable and I don't expect anything amazing from an affordable burrito joint.\n\nFirst of all, this place has a history of charging meat burrito prices for their bean and cheese (meatless) super burritos, so look out and be sure to question them if the charge doesn't seem right. I'm sure many of you won't lose any sleep over a 50 cents to a dollar higher charge per super burrito, but its about the principle. If the price being charged doesn't reflect the charge on their big wooden overhead menu, I think you should say something about it. ESPECIALLY because of the douchebag at the cashier I encountered at least twice about this same issue A FULL YEAR APART.\n\nMakes up some bull poop about it being because of the tax. Regardless of what my math level is, I'll tell you I can use a calculator which is on every smartphone ever and quickly compared the cashier charge to what should be charged based on the big wooden menu. Douchbag cashier REFUSES to double check and insists its tax related, then I challenge him to press the buttons for a bean and cheese and immediately notice the first charge for the burrito itself is too high. I usually get bean and cheese with guacamole, so that is 2 buttons - 1 for the burrito, and 1 for the \"extra\" guac. He says the machine just charges that amount and is basically being a gigantic prick about it.\n\nNow I'm not going to go bankrupt over a dollar or less difference, but its about the principle, and the reaction to my challenge. LEARN SOME BLEEPING CUSTOMER SERVICE you entitled piece of poop! If you just got off your high horse and walked over to the menu, then pressed the button on the cashier, you could CLEARLY see the charge was wrong.\n\nHe begrudgingly gives me a dollar back from the tip jar and makes a remark that \"you probably need it\". Was that really necessary? I was only rude to him because he was rude to me first. Also, that was TIP that someone else left FOR THE STAFF, WHY ARE YOU GIVING THAT BACK TO ME, A CUSTOMR\n\nLuckily this place is a low cost place and so many people don't expect any service, and burritos are good if you avoid the meat (some people find the meat good even). For this reason, and mostly overlooking the douchebag casher, I give this place a more than fair 3 stars. But they really should correct that overcharge for meatless burritos. I just hate to thinK how many people they have overcharged over the years because just recently I think its happening again at a nearby location on Clement (yet to be confirmed)...sigh. Thankfully not all Gordo locations are staffed with douchebag cashiers.", "author": "Ken S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-08", "description": "I've been coming here for years. Gordos was my favorite taqueria growing up. The prices were low, the meat and fillings were flavorful, and the portions were huge. I remember countless weekend mornings when I used to eat super Gordo burritos with my best friends in college. It was the perfect aid to our hangovers. We would run home because we were so excited. I also came here during my time in grad school to reward myself after a midterm or final exam. Lately, I feel as though the quality has gone a bit down hill and the prices, just the opposite. Today, I ordered a super steak burrito with everything. The price was around $10.50, a little more than I'm used to. For that price, I'm expecting a really juicy and delicious burrito. However, the steak tasted bland. The beans and rice tasted fresh, but lacked flavor. I couldn't distinguish the sour cream from the guacamole. I was pretty disappointed. Maybe there was new staff? I didn't recognize anyone there. When I review Gordos, I think it is fair to compare it to other nearby taquerias and restaurants. For $10.50, I would rather go to Taqueria Los Mayas or use that money to get some pho. The curry restaurant next door is also a great, delicious alternative. It will definitely be hard for me to go to Gordos anytime soon with all of the tasty options nearby. Gordos was 5 stars back in the day. Within the past 4 years, it lowered to a 3 or 3.5. I hope it will get back to that 5 star level. I will give it a few more tries. If it is consistently a 3, I will have to say farewell to Gordos.", "author": "Petunia M."}

My classmate Stevie Jo mentioned Gordo's being awesome.  She was one of my closest friends, so I was like heck yeah I wanna try this!  \n\nSo I came here one weekend with my dad and sister when I was 10 years old, ordered a chicken burrito, and liked it.  A lot.  I mean, it was a Mission burrito, and I was just a kid who didn't know the names or the hypes; I just knew I liked good food, and this was good.\n\nAnd all the way till my college years, I believed that Gordo's was the best in the City.  \n\nThen, I discovered the Mission.

Plus, in your early 20s, what's not to like about the Mission?  It's where everyone wants to be, right?  Food, culture, Dolores Park, everything.  \n\nSo, I stayed in the Mission.  Kept eating those Mission burritos.  Lovin' those big, cheap rolls of delicious.  Who cares that it takes me about 45 minutes to get across town to the Mission.  Hella worth it.\n\nAnd then tonight, I was walking past Gordo, revisiting old haunts.  It was around dinnertime, and I was hungry.  \n\nI hadn't had a Gordo burrito in years.  Should I revisit a ghost of my burrito past?  Sure, why not?

It's my turn, I order a regular burrito with chicken.  The guy takes the tortilla, slaps on a big piece of cheese, and warms it up.  Takes it out after a minute, and slaps on grilled chicken, salsa, beans.  I add cheese and guacamole for an extra dollar or so.  Pretty quick service.  \n\nThe base price is $4.25 for a regular burrito, but since I had some additional stuff, I pay $5.86 and walk outta there.  Open it immediately, take a few bites.  Take another few bites.  And another few bites.  \n\nYou can tell how this is gonna turn out.  ;)\n\nI get home, finish off the rest while watching some baseball.  The burrito was expertly wrapped - no mess at the end or fork needed to pick up pieces that have fallen out.

But if you're going make a burrito with everything but the meat then those ingredients better be damn good.  Sadly at Gordo they are not.\n\nThe salsa (actually pico de gallo) was completely flavorless, made of underripe tomatoes and lazily cut giant chunks of onion.  The bland rice made up about 50% of the filling--as did everyone elses burrito I watched being made--indicating this place has an agenda to keep their costs down.   The beans were forgettable and there was inadequate cheese to hold the whole thing together.   Guacamole was so-so, but the sour cream was so thick it curdled into chunks quickly.  And no lettuce available?  Come on. Insult to injury, the roll up was badly done and the entire burrito fell apart after two bites.\n\nI really feel that the only reason there is any line in this restaurant is because its the only tacqueria in the area, so they are popular by merely existing.

If that's true, this California city with a spanish name is severely lacking in quality mexi food. This was just plain weak. Asked for guac, got no guac. Loaded with bland and tasteless rice and beans, which is just filler. The chicken itself was ok, but not enough to redeem this thing. The hot sauce? Ok. The pico? Bland - like old tomatoes and barely any cilantro.

Then, I went to pay and asked for chips and was told they were out....really? Ughh.. and then, lastly, eating the burrito that was so coveted by me in the past (and granted...i get that sometimes, our memories play tricks on us and make us think things are better in the past than they really were...) but, i just didn't get that---yum, comfort food feeling that I used to get! It was just meh....kind of broke my heart a little.  I mean, it was not awful, though--and it did have that certain flavor that I associate with Gordo's--but, it didn't wow me like it had in the past...maybe it was the turn off from checking out?

Tell them before you order.\n\nSecond: Service is fine here, unless you're expecting the folks behind the counter to take you to your seat and serve you some wine. The folks behind the counter want to get you in and get you out quickly. Because the lines get big here, especially during lunchtime. \n\nAnd the lines are here for a reason. This is a quick, inexpensive burrito joint of the highest order. Beans. Rice. Meat. You can throw in some some pico and hot sauce.

Since high school I've been frequenting Gordo, always a favorite of my eldest brother and for obvious reasons.  There are fresh ingredients, it's tasty yet clean, they have a transparent preparation process, a variety of flavors, and the service is pretty impeccable.  By that I mean the one thing I've come to expect, and really require, in a burrito place is that they get my order right.\n\nANYWAY, the first life I lived at Gordo was a life of grilled and boiled chicken and carne asada.  I don't have an aversion to pork - I love bacon, I love pork chops, etc., I just never tried fried, seasoned pork at a taqueria because, well, I hadn't.  But it was a good life.  Boiled chicken is better with black beans.  Grilled is better with pinto.  Steak is better with refried.  I was in mix and match heaven.\n\nThat all changed last year, though, when I started my second life at Gordo.  I tried the carnitas.  They don't do carnitas like this anywhere else.  I've looked.  It's fried pork.  Let me slow down.  FRIED.  PORK.  Oh sweet Jesus (pronounced \"Hay-Zues\" - we're in a Mexican restaurant after all...) that stuff is good.

I've been a fan for more than 10 years when this one didn't exist and you had to squish into the clement store.\n\nI'm not sure what I did, but the fat (yes, fat) burrito maker guy is always so stingy when i order. \n\nThe older guy is great, makes huge super burritos aka 'footballs' but this fat guy just hates us! The person i went with ordered a quesadilla. Granted that you don't expect a 'football' when you order a quesadilla, but you expect something a little more than the tortilla, oil and melted cheese. she asked for meat, rice, tomatoes and hot sauce and it barely covered the cheese!!!!\n\nhow can you fill a quesadilla but still see the cheese on the bottom? obviously you need not be so stingy. So she asked if she could have a little more rice and that's exactly what he gave her......maybe 10-15 KERNELS of rice........ we joked after that next time 1.) avoid that guy, 2.) ask for a lot of more rice haha\n\nI got a super burrito and this burrito had nothing SUPER about it. . . . it must have been the size of a small regular burrito made by any of the other workers. There was more tortilla than anything. My first 3 bites (normal, not little mouse bites) were ALL tortilla.....maybe some cheese, but you get the point.\n\nI don't know how to review this one.....everyone is normally nice and gives good portions but that fat guy would seriously make me stop going to gordos. I hate to be mean, but a guy that big making food would expect to give you hearty portions. I'm sure if he made a super burrito for himself it would be 3x the size of the little dinky taco-sized super burrito that he made me.", "author": "edie t."}

Not having any sense of where I was going, I relied heavily on my more important than oxygen GPS to get me around. I crossed Geary Street on the way back and decided that Geary would be a good street to hunt for food. I used the Wells Fargo as a stopping point and surveyed the surrounding areas.\n\nAt close to 9:00 pm, I figured most of places would be lacking for patrons but not Gordo's Taqueria. I walked by, the whole time thinking no more Mexican food cuz I nearly OD'ed on it in the previous few days, and decided, okay, any place with a significant line at this hour must be pretty decent. I had to wait nearly 10 minutes to get my order in as the there was only one gent assembling the food there. It was worth the wait. I order the Carnitas burrito and even after a lengthy car ride back, the burrito held up and along with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, it went down smoothly.\n\nThere were a few choices of meaty fillings and the rest of the toppings/fillings were pretty standard.

On top of that, I've actually been to another Mexican place that I like more. \n\nI'm not even going to bother writing about the service, so i'll jump straight into the food. The burritos are a hit to me and it's probably the most popular order for me. It doesn't matter which meat you choose, but the best ones are grilled chicken and the carnitas. The salsa seems fresh and the guacamole is awesome. Add beans at your own discretion. \n\nAnother alternative to the burritos is the Gordo special dishes like the Gordo plate, which is essentially every part of a burrito or taco in separated sections of a take-out tray. There's plenty of rice, meat, salsa, sour cream and guacamole that would make the Gordo plate a feast for anyone. It includes some flour tortillas, so you could make your own soft tacos if you like, or do what I usually do and take everything and turn it into Mexican fried rice. \n\nThe other alternative is the Gordo cup for the budget minded individual. Similar to the Gordo plate in terms of content, but in a \"cup\" or a small tupperware-like container. It's usually packed to the rim, so be careful when you open it. \n\nGordo's is a good place for Mexican, but I see it as fast Mex.

Actually the Clement Street one was the \"good Gorods\" until about a year ago. One must not have high expectations of fancy burritos with lots of extras, Gordos is a straight burrito/quesadilla taqueria--\nthe chips aren't great and there are no sides to be had, but the burriots and quesadillas are to die for.\n\nAnd for those of you not in the know, here's a little fun fact. The steamers used at Gordos and some other San Francisco taquerias are in fact native to San Francisco as well:\n\n\"The San Francisco burrito is distinguished partly by the amount of rice and other side dishes included in the package and partly by sheer size. A food critic working for the San Francisco Chronicle counted hundreds of taquerias in the San Francisco Bay Area, and noted that the topic of which taqueria makes the best burrito can 'encourage fierce loyalty and ferocious debate'\"\n\nAlso:\n\n\"Two key technologies that made the San Francisco burrito possible are the large flour tortilla and tortilla steamers, which together increase the flexibility, stretch, and size of the resulting tortilla. The tortilla steamer saturates the gluten-heavy tortilla with moisture and heat, which increase the capacity of the tortilla to stretch without breaking. This in turn allows for the size of the San Francisco burrito.\"\n\nFrom Wikipedia.com (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Burrito)", "author": "Michelle D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-02", "description": "In my house, there is an ongoing conversation about creating the perfect San Francisco burrito using ingredients from all over the city. My perfect burrito would include many ingredients from Gordo Taqueria. \n\nI was wary of Gordo when I first started coming almost 5 years ago. I was raised on authentically Mexican taquerias (an upbringing that still leads me to order my burritos sans rice) and wasn't accustomed to the San Francisco burrito experience. Let me tell you, I am now. This fine cuisine has grown on me and I now get cravings only Gordo can satisfy.\n\nI want to say it's all in the steamed tortilla, but that doesn't work because I love the quesadillas as much as the burritos. Giant flour tortillas fried, packed with as much filling as a super burrito, and then folded in thirds. Oh, and the corn quesadilla. The dear, dear corn quesadilla. The beef corn is a family favorite, but I recently became addicted to a veggie version - black beans, guacamole, and pico. Juicy, messy, lard-soaked goodness. \n\nOh, and I must mention the boiled chicken. Really, most of the meats are great (beef, carnitas, boiled chicken, or grilled chicken - I stay away from the chile verde because of a chile allergy, and avoid like the plague the al pastor offered at certain locations, but must admit I don't like al pastor at any taqueria), but my usual order has become two corn quesadillas (one black bean, one boiled chicken) when dining there, and a boiled chicken burrito when taking it to-go. The black or pinto beans are firm and flavorful and I did a lot of research deciding which beans to pair with which meat, but the refried beans are flavorless and should be skipped.\n\nBut, more than anything, my love belongs to the Gordo guacamole. Not as pure as the mashed avocados found at La Taqueria in the Mission, but my favorite part of any order. Something about this goopy green mess has become a part of my soul. I want to slather my body with the stuff. One of my worst memories is when we went to the 9th & Irving location just before close and they were out. Out of guacamole. At first I thought the guy was joking. How could it be? A nightmare! Good thing we go to the Geary location a couple times a week, so my craving was satisfied a couple days later, or I would have continued in a distraught state indefinitely. Phew.

Now?  I just went there for the first time this month and it sucked, as usual.\n\nI should probably rate Gordo 1 star, the way it's tasted lately, but I have strong memories of amazing, 5-star burritos I've had in the past that prevent me from doing that.\n\nThere is no problem with the decor, the employees, the presentation.  There is no problem with selection, and they are very fast.\n\nThe only problem is the food is crap, possibly literally.  I'm eating my burrito and a bite or two are delicious, and then suddenly you feel like you've bitten into... something rotten.  Either the meat tastes like it's three days old, or the beans do.  It's always something.  The carnitas are insanely good one day and crap the next.  Same for the carne asada (beef).   And the problem with getting a burrito at a place that uses shady ingredients (or keeps good ones for too long) is that there are so many ways it can go wrong.\n\nWith a quesadilla, at least, there are fewer ingredients - less can go wrong.  I love the corn (tortilla) quessadilla.  They can't mess up the tortilla or the cheese, really, so all you need to pray for is that the meat isn't \"off\" yet.  Of course, that's usually the first thing that goes off.  And when they can't even get the corn quesadillar right, I give up.  I would rather spend my $5-$6 per day somewhere else, where I don't consistently develop facial twitches of disgust when I'm trying to provide my body with essential nutrition.\n\nA couple more things:  someone else mentioned stinginess.  They have been WAY STINGY lately as well.  I pay extra for guacomole, and they barely put any on the burrito.  Can I bring my own? They also skimp on the (rotten) meat (which could be a good thing).  I assume that their boss is trying to cut costs.  The best guy to get to make your burrito would be THE NEW GUY (whoever hasn't yet been told that the best way to run a burrito joint is to keep the customers hungry).  But none of this matters when the food quality is crap.\n\nGordo, pay up.  Buy fresher ingredients.  Throw away old meat.

I don't know if it's just me, but they always pile on a little more fillings at this place over the other locations.  Although this place isn't exactly authentic (I've had some friends tell me that putting tortillas in steamers is sacrilege), I still find their burritos tasty and more than filling.  I also love the flour quesedillas, even though they really pour on the oil, the result is a crispy, flaky tortilla that tastes great with all that melted cheese.", "author": "Tony L."}

I used to bitch to anyone that would listen that La Burrita was crap (and they would listen because I was from Santa Barbara), but Gordo's was tolerable.  I didn't even know they had multiple locations till a few years ago.\nFast forward a few years, and I've come to terms with the state of Mexican food away from the Mission and SB.  Gordo's is good.  Not as good as the taquerias in the Mission, but it's a good burrito that'll fill you up for not much money, plus I can walk to it in under 3 minutes when I'm really hungry.  One thing I have to say for Gordo's is that they're consistent, Gordo's on Geary is the same as Gordo's on College, Clement, etc.  Don't come here for their tacos or nachos, but take home a chicken burrito and have a cold Negro Modelo ready and you're set.", "author": "Mike U."}

I love taquerias and b. It's the only game in town (walking distance, that is).\n\nDeep down, as I munch away on my 2nd or 3rd burrito or quesadilla that week, I can't help but get angry. After patronizing the same place for as long as that, not one employee evinces a spark of recognition or memory for me or what I almost always order. My roommate thinks I'm nuts for even noticing, but I guess his expectations are lower. Actually, it's not even that I have high expectations. I'm actually shocked. \n\nIt seems to me that as an employee you would have to go out of your way to pretend you haven't seen the same customer come in time and time again. So really, maybe I'm more shocked, even impressed that they could carry on this thing for this long. \n\nAs to a previous review, I'm glad I don't speak Spanish.\n\nAs a guide to the uninitiated, here's a sample dialogue for ordering at Gordo:\n\nWorker: Help you.\nMe: Hi, could I get a super carne asada with black beans and hot sauce, no guacamole to go?\nW: No response, but steams tortilla for a few seconds\nW: What kind beans?\nM: Uhh, black.\nW: What kind meat?\nM: I want a super carne asada with black beans and hot sauce, no guacamole to go.\nW: Hot sauce?\nM: YES.\nW: Sour cream and guacamole?\nM: No guacamole.\nW: For here or to go?\nM: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis is no exaggeration.

I'm sorry, Gordo's food is not good enough to justify my returning. I see I'm not the only one who's complained about this. Clearly, Gordo's is doing great business, lousy service or not. Nonetheless, it's lost mine and I'll encourage anyone who cares to listen, not to frequent Gordo's in future.", "author": "Leo B."}
