I love the decor and ambiance, keeping the old school drugs sign out front and the Texas looking decor inside. Although it was a little weird that the first thing we noticed were coffee bags hanging from the ceiling yet no coffee listed on the menu.. *insert thinking emoji face here*\n\nWe ordered the Conor fries, combo plate of brisket and ribs with a side of cornbread and Mac and cheese. The Conor fries were hands down my favorite part of the meal. It was a great way to sample all their homemade sauces to prepare what sauces to use for the BBQ. I loved the chunks of meat in the fries and the melted cheese was so good. \n\nSecond best was the brisket but only because it was good to eat with the sauce. It wasn't as good alone, not as tender as I would've liked but ok nonetheless. The ribs were too burnt for me and definitely wasn't \"fall off the bone\" good. But not bad either. \n\nAnother notable thing was the fresh lemonade. It was super sweet but I liked it. They seem to only have a small batch made since the table next to us tried to order but was told they were sold out.\n\nThe guy serving us was really nice and I loved the little kiddie corner they had next to our table. It goes well with the whole \"Baby\" name.", "author": "Jayne S."}

This was one of the few BBQ places that was open until 10, so we thought we'd give it a try. \n\nPRICE: The prices were standard and to be expected for a BBQ place in SF. A 2 meat combo plate was $21 with tax, and the yelp 7% cash back is also a nice perk too!\n\nFOOD/MENU: We got a 2 meat combo plate with beef brisket (sliced and smoked) and baby back ribs with a side of creamed spinach and included cornbread to share between 2 people. I was pleasantly surprised by how big the portion was! It had 2 large baby back ribs and four 8\"X1.5\" (estimated) slices of brisket. We were both pretty satisfied with the amount of food and we didn't order anything extra. \n\nFLAVOR: Taste-wise, it was overall okay. The baby back ribs were flavorful and smokey and went well with the choice of 4 sauces at the table: original (had an interesting bitter kick to it), sweet molasses (my favorite! Not too sweet), medium (tasted like Tabasco), and XXX (which wasn't impossible to handle). The brisket also had nice flavor, but it was cold. Maybe it was because it was almost closing time but I wish the brisket were served hot. \n\nThe creamed spinach was good too, but I think I was a little too lactose intolerant to fully enjoy it  It wasn't very thick and it had a slight bitter taste, but it wasn't bad. \n\nOverall, it was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Maybe if I'm craving BBQ at 9 pm again!", "author": "Rebecca T."}

We had friends from Philly coming in to visit and needed a kid friendly place.  This place was great.  There's a little nook for kids the play in, there we're TVs around so we can watch the Giants game, and there was a nice selection of beer to choose from.  The best part was the food.  For a group of eight, it barely cost us $170 and there were plenty of leftovers! The ribs and brisket were delicious (love that sassy molasses with the XXX sauce), and the cornbread was addicting.  Roasted Chicken was a little dry, but the fried chicken was spot on. They had a small kids menu but overall, it was all good. \n\nWe also discovered that the owner is from Philly and that his brothers own the other restaurants in Philly (and I think LA).  One downer is that there is no dessert on the menu, but don't despair!  Mitchell's ice cream is in walking distance (a local institution!) \n\nThis was a great way to wrap up our friends' SF visit.

We ordered the biggest party platter for a party of 12 and finished more than half! I also tried collard greens for the first time ever here and it was pretty delicious.

This place can be a little tight with space. I have 2 children and I don't recommend taking in a stroller. However, they do have baby chairs that you can flip upside down for the car seat or just leave up for your toddler to sit in.

Surprisingly, we were the only patrons at that time. Overall the Bf and I were really satisfied with our meals. I opted for the 2 meat combo with one side and he went for their pulled pork sandwich. I can't rave enough about how tender and juicy the smoked chicken was. You can really mess up a good BBQ chicken by making it too dry and they definitely didn't do that. My second meat open was the beef brisket and dear god that was some intense flavors going on. My Bf couldn't stop picking at my plate. \n\nHe also enjoyed his sandwich but probably would have opted for a combo plate instead. We also shared their candid bacon which was such a treat. Sometimes when folks make sweeten bacon they over sweeten it and forget to let the savory goodness of bacon shine. I really appreciate the bit of spice and smokiness that came through.

The restaurant was pretty empty on a Monday night, but I made a reservation just in case (Opentable points what what). It's a great place for groups, and they serve a variety of beers and wines at reasonable prices. When I walked in, a very hipster bartender greeted me, and she was super friendly and prompt!\n\nAfter reading numerous reviews, it seemed that the shrimp and salmon were amazing, but Yelpers didn't agree on most of the meats and sides. I decided to try a sampling of different items to resolve this debate myself. I found that the shrimp was truly delicious and that the meat and sides were pretty average.\n\n* BABY BLUES BAYOU, Grilled BBQ Shrimp ($22.95) - 4 STARS: Very delicious and fresh, but I definitely wouldn't qualify it as a \"Tiger Prawn,\" which is what they advertise under sides. It's a small-medium sized prawn, and overall pretty expensive considering it comes with just 7 shrimp. I would have preferred to order a la carte (@ $2.50 each), since I wasn't a big fan of the sides (2 complimentary sides and corn bread). I'd suggest if you just want shrimp to buy a la carte since I wasn't a huge fan of the sides.\n\n* BONES AND NO BONES, 1/2 Baby Back Ribs and 1/2 lb Pulled Pork or Beef Brisket ($25.95) - 2.5 STARS: I was not impressed by the ribs (not tender), the pulled pork (tasted pretty standard), or the brisket (which was plasticy and just not good). The saving grace was there large variety of BBQ sauces which spiced things up.\n\nSides:\n* Cole Slaw: Standard\n* Sauteed Okra: Surprisingly tasty and comes with stewed tomatoes mixed in\n* Collard Greens: Standard but good\n* Corn Bread: Sweet and chunky, not my cup of tea.\n* Mac n Cheese: Just.... bad. I'm sad to report this had too much flour, seemed to be stewed too long, and lacked the necessary seasoning and cheese. I prefer easy mac.\n\nBaby Blues is a cool spot, and I would definitely return with a large group because it has the perfect ambiance for you and friends to catch up over BBQ and beers. I wasn't particularly impressed by the food, but I wouldn't mind coming back and sticking with the seafood even though it is overpriced.

So much so, that I looked at the menu and decided on my dish. For starters, we had the Suicide King with pork,  I got the Bones, No Bones, hubby got the Memphis Queen and of course the kids got the chicken strips and mac and cheese.\n\nStarter: The cornbread was tasty and crubmbly. It was on the sweeter side, which was ok.  The pork and coleslaw  was fine, nothing exciting about it.\nHowever, the BBQ sauces that they had on the table are to DIE FOR!!! They should sell them!!!  A lot better than what you can get from the grocery store. I was dousing all my meat in it. My combination was the sweet sauce along with their spicy one. \n\nMain dishes: I was a little disappointed, our meat was room temperature. I'm sure it would have been better if it was hot. Also, I was looking forward to sliced beef brisket and not shredded beef brisket. Insert sad face here!\n\nThe mac and cheese tasted strange.... I think it was the cheese they used??. nMy kids didn't even finish theirs! And they can eat mac and cheese for days! Even the stuff out of the box!\n\nService:  Spotty throughout the night.

The flavor was okay but the texture was not that of a creamy, homemade pudding and, of course, there was not a hint of a real banana (and I know why; bananas have a very short shelf life and turn brown quickly).

We wanted a place to relax, kick back eat some yummy BBQ, and sneak a beer. The result, perfect evening. \n\nWe snagged a high top next to the walk-in closet which serves as the 'kids corner'. Our two year old and five year old had a blast while we snuck a frosty draft lagunitas. We ordered off of the kids menu for the oldest and split a combo plate of ribs and pulled pork for the rest of us. The pulled pork was excellent, the ribs could have been trimmed a bit more, but the rub was great, the sauces were very good too. Perhaps not the best st BBQ I've ever had, but i felt it was done with care and respect for the grilling arts and more importantly it hit the spot. The sides were fantastic. The greens superb and the mashed potatoes were a home made affair that weren't drowned in cream or butter. We liked it so much we ordered a second combo right then and there. The peeps next to us had a large family plate piled with all sorts of BBQ goodness and some beautiful looking corn on the cob.... we were more than a little motivated to come back to try more of the menu.\n\nIn sum, honest BBQ, done by folks that provide a chill unpretentious ambiance.

I enjoy very fine barbecue, spiced and smoked to melting, swabbed with molasses, but don't look to me for experiential cultural knowledge of what constitutes authentic Memphis BBQed thusandsuch. \n\nWe got the Big Blue ($28.95), which is three meats with any two sides, and chose smoked salmon fillet, grilled BBQ tiger shrimp, and baby back ribs for our meats, and pork and beans, and chicken smoked rice for our sides. This came with one piece of dark cornbread, about which I liked the little bits of whole corn that popped in my mouth. It's more like a crusty, rustic corn cake, with a little caramelization inside and out. This is a cornbread that is best reserved for dipping into the dregs of whatever meaty, sweety swill is left on your plate, otherwise known as my favorite part of every bar-b-cue adventure. \n\nThe salmon arrived with a little cup of buttermilk dill dressing, which was in totality the star of the show. I didn't perceive any smokiness to the plain, unseasoned salmon whatsoever, but what I did get was a luscious, tender piece of regular fresh salmon fillet cooked to the perfect humidity and color, and when paired with the addictive buttermilk dill dressing, I felt like a stingy dog growling low over a bowl of something awesome. \n\nI didn't share the salmon, but I did fork over half of the baby back ribs and sides. The ribs were excellent in the thick molasses sauce. I just wish there had been more of them. I didn't care for the thinner, vinegar-based BBQ sauce, and the chile-based one was predictably too hot for me (see also: the whole hot peppers in vinegar bottle), but these are absolutely personal taste things, and not a reflection on their quality. \n\nI was simultaneously pleased and grossed out by the tiger shrimp; pleased at how they were butterflied, so the flesh really plumped up with barbecue seasonings on the grill, but disgusted by the bottom inch per shrimp that wasn't de-veined. That's a polite way of saying that the poop-tubes were intact. I had to do BBQ-infused surgery on them, and it wasn't pretty. For $2.50 apiece \u00e0 la carte, these are too expensive to merit leaving behind any hint of shrimp-crap.\n\nAs for the sides, the pork and beans was excellent, topped with huge hunks of tangy, melty, pre-pulled pork. Unfortunately, the chicken-smoked rice was dry, full of multicolored pepper skins, and nothing to write home about.\n\nThe smallish meal (Big Blue, a bottle of Perrier, tax, and ~22% tip) ran us $45. It came with unlimited napkins, wet-naps, and toothpicks (I'm not being sarcastic - some places charge you for these things!).\n\nI do think this place is a four-star BBQ place, and a four-star place in general, especially in terms of San Francisco. The staff was friendly, the bar patrons were also very pleasant (everyone on stools looked to be dressed in a neofuturist speakeasy style), they're open past 9PM, they have a whole area of kids' toys, and the walls bore a small collection of tasteful old objects that set a pleasant, quirky (but not hokey) atmosphere. We'll be back (at the very least, for that salmon)!", "author": "Austin J. A."}

It seems that whenever we start discussing restaurants, we start debating which place in the neighborhood is good, which is overrated and which we have tried already and have yet to try. Ehhh, it seems we all have our opinion and interests. \n\nMy Dad and I were going out for dinner the other night and couldn't make up our mind of which restaurant to go to. We stopped here because parking was ample. I had been looking forward to Baby Blues BBQ for quite sometime, but wasn't sure about the timing since I had plans later. BBQ takes time.\n\nWe sat at the bar and checked out the menu. We ordered a couple pints of beer and the Prawn Appetizer to start. I noticed the custom bottles of Barbeque Sauce and the girl on the label. OMG, that's ME! :) Lol. \n\nThe sauces were good and my favorite, the hot one - but don't get your hopes up, it was on the mild side. We like things spicy. The prawns were very yummy, 4 was enough as a mini appetizer before dinner. \n\nMy Dad and I also like to share, I ordered the Beef Brisket Sandwich and he ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich. Both meals served with coleslaw and around $9.00 each. Great deal for dinner. \n\nMy sandwich was sweet and good, the meat very tender. As messy as it looks, it was very good. The chicken sandwich was huge, an entire breast of chicken, grilled and soooo good. The sandwiches were pretty big and I gave my Dad the other half of my sandwich to take home. \n\nWhen we left, we thanked everyone for the good food and service. This is most definitely a place I will come back to and bring fellow BBQ lovers.", "author": "Rebekah T."}

Though I had to share it with my partner and his ribs meal, it was a hell of a beast. A large piece of beef rib. Just what I wanted.\n\nThe beef rib was tender and juicy.  After eating all the meat, I devoured the remaining meat on the bone.   Darn good.  My sides were the saut\u00e9ed okra and the sweet mashed potatoes.   Both were good, as the okra was not slimy and deep fried. And the sweet mashed potato light in flavor.\n\nI am glad that we ordered from here for lunch, as I have been meaning to eat here in a loooooooong time.   Baby Blues Bbq, you did me good.

Made salad and got 2 orders of chicken wings and a slab of ribs delivered. Knew I don't care for their sides but did not have a problem with their meat until today. Chicken wings were white skinned and slimy to the touch. Slight grill marks on just a couple. Guess too much effort.  After 3 attempts of calling and getting hung up on, finally reach someone and try to explain the wings are subpar. Hoping they would have offered to come get them and replace. Guy just says they are cooked all the way through. I tell him they are not, they are slimy and he just replies \"we don't fry our wings\". Hmmmm, assuming I don't know BBQ joints don't fry chicken wings. Thank you. Never did like the sides, though always thought the meat was passable. Would have made allowances for a one time undercooked meal, if they had made it right! But after the f'd up attitude of the person on the phone, this sad excuse for BBQ has lost my business. Miss the old days of going down to San Bruno Ave for some Vic n Bettys, or  B&L. Maybe this place ok for hipsters from Wisconsin, but if you can't grill a chicken wing, please pack it up.\nHahaha. ..BTW, 1 slab of ribs and two orders of wings=4 tiny containers of sauce.

But  I was slightly disappointed with my food selection.  Sure I ordered the small platter plate, but I could barely distinguish my baby back ribs on the plate.\n\nI had the \"hound dog\" platter of ribs and beef brisket with choice of one side and corn bread.  I paid an extra $1.00 for the baby back in place of the Memphis style ribs.\n\nI get the stubby tail end of the baby back.  Four dinky pieces.  Yes, I know baby backs are the smaller ribs, but this was ridiculously small.  And the beef brisket resembled pulled pork and tasted like pork.  We asked the server if we got the brisket, and she confirmed yes.  I got the sweet mashed potatoes as my side. Very good.\n\nPros - reservations accepted.  We were party of eight.  Beer on draft.  Choice of BBQ sauces ranging from sweet, tangy to spicy.  You can request separate checks.  We requested four.  Fixings were good. And great R&B soul music playing in the background.\n\nCons - noisy and hard to carry normal level conversation.  Ribs so so.  Beef brisket unlike any I've had in BBQ places.  I'm accustomed to brisket like corn beef brisket where the pieces are sliced and not shredded.\n\nYour ribs are not dressed.  You need to lather on the sauce yourself.  The reason for four various BBQ sauces on the table.\n\nHubby had the platter plate with two fixings and corn bread.  He had the Memphis style pork ribs. Memphis style ribs = pork ribs, but longer than the baby backs and meatier.  He got the sides of pork and beans and spicy chicken rice. \n\n18% gratuity added to each check.  Ours was $61.00 inc tax and tip.  Three draft beers and two platter plates.\n\nI don't think I will be back.", "author": "Shirley N."}

We drove in to SF to Baby Blues to try this place for the first time.\n\nThree of us ordered the beef brisket; 1 thought it was ok and 2 wouldn't want to order it again.  It has little flavor, which brings me to the sauces on the tables.  There are four mystery sauce bottles: no labels, no indication of sweet, spicy, mild, or fiery.  I'm a wimp in the heat department, so my Husband usually tells me what he thinks I can handle.  Mystery sauce #1 was ok, with a little bit of a kick. I didn't want to try any others, risking any further heat potential.\n\nOne ordered the ribs; she couldn't finish it, but didn't want to bring the leftovers home either.\n\nThe cornbread was definitely unique.  I'm kind of old and have had quite a few cornbreads over the years.  I have never tried anything like this before.  It had a shine to it, and looks like it may be fried but what do I know?  The taste is indescribable.  I tried a little, as if I were an actual taste tester.  I moved it around in my mouth and couldn't put my finger on what I was tasting. I tried more and kept thinking how this is not cornbread, it's another mystery item at this restaurant.\n\nThe creamed spinach is definitely not like what I'm used to seeing.  I think of creamed spinach as soupy, this is fresh spinach with stems that I feel may have been steamed or boiled, but not tossed in a blender, that's for sure!\n\nThey have a \"kids corner\" that didn't look like any kids visited it in a while. We weren't sure if they styled it to look rustic, like some of the stools, or if everything was just worn out.\n\nFYI: they have two restrooms. One door has an \"m\" on it; the other has a dartboard on it. I guess they are both unisex restrooms.\n\nWe came, we saw, we tasted - 4 out of 4 vote that we will probably try a different BBQ place when we have another craving.", "author": "Dee M."}

For 7pm on a weeknight it was pretty empty and as you come in you're unsure if you seat yourself or a hostess will greet you. Eventually an employee came up and said anywhere I'd like to sit would be fine. A few of the bar stools were taken but other than that it was pretty slow, with only a few tables of customers.\n\nI was handed a menu and after going over my options, I decided to go with the shrimp sandwich rather than slab of ribs to myself. The menu has starters, salads, fixins (side orders), small plates, platters, sandwiches, a la carte meat menu, and a kids menu. There's plenty of great sounding smoked meats including: brisket, pulled pork, hot links, burgers, and ribs, of course. The grilled shrimp po'boy runs for $11.95 and is topped with cole slaw and does not include any fixins.\n\nIt's here where Baby Blues began to detrioriate for me. I don't mind the fact that it took a minute to figure out the seating situation, but I do mind waiting over 15 minutes for a small sandwich and a sliced pickle. As I waited I saw the similar problem with others, not knowing if they should seat themselves or whether a waitress woulld seat them. The resteraunt began to pick up and eventually my shrimp po'boy came out and my waitress was very friendly and explained the sauces and recommended a tabasco-like sauce for my sandwich which was spot on. \n\nThe sandwich was served on ciabatta bread and was simply shrimp and cole slaw. It was a rather bland sandwich but the shrimp were grilled nicely and the recommended sauce gave it a necessary kick in flavor. Other than that I stuffed the pickle into my sandwich and those were the only componenets to the sandwich. I expected a bit more for $12 and I guess that's where the fixins come into play. Once done with my meal, business steadily picked up and it was getting busy around 8 o'clock. With only 2 or 3 waitresses on duty and one bus boy, I was left waiting for my check for a good 10 minutes and another 10 minutes or so to return my card.

The baby back ribs were not as tasty compared to the mesquite ribs.  If ordering again, I would only get the mesquite ribs.  They were so nicely flavored, I didn't even need to add much sauce.  They serve 3 types of sauces: original spicy, and sweet (molasses).  My favorite was the original.\n\nBrisket:  I love brisket when it is juicy.  Unfortunately, our two orders of brisket were dry.  The sliced brisket sort of reminded me of shims my contractor uses.  I ate only half of one slice and allowed the server to take the rest away to the trash.  Even BBQ sauce didn't make it tasty enough to eat.  The other diners in my group all thought the brisket was below average.  What a disappointment.\nShrimp:  I personally didn't eat the shrimp but 2 other diners in my group did and both said they were delicious.  One person said he would go back to Baby Blues just for the shrimp.  Guess I should have ordered it.\n\nSides:  The sides were good but the only one that was exceptional was the mac and cheese.  Most mac and cheese tastes like Kraft squeeze cheese.  This one tasted like someone melted on freshly grated cheese on the macaroni.  The server raved about the corn bread but we thought it was average.\nDrinks:  Sodas are 12 oz. cans accompanied by a cup of ice.  They have ice tea that offer free refills.  I ordered the beer flight which is four 7 oz. pours of any of their beers available on tap.  I really like that I can pick any 4 and not be limited to a preset menu.  Unfortunately, they had only about half of the beers listed so I had to re-choose my order several times.  For $12 it wasn't a bad deal for beer tasting.\nService:  I don't put service high on my list as I go out for the food.  The service here was OK.  The servers were friendly and gave us their opinions when asked.\n\nOverall, I thought the mesquite ribs were good enough to return for if I'm in the area.

I've been to 4505, Southpaw, and whatever the Brenda's side project on Divis is called, and Baby Blues beats them all by a country mile. \n\nAmbiance: really friendly. There's always a game on at the TV over the bar, but not too loud. After work there's a crowd of regulars who hang out and watch a game, a lot of them latino guys, friendly familiar neighborhoody guys who give the place a nice 'regulars' ambiance. \n\nPeople who eat here are a great mix of different types, not all rich white techies, but enough of them so the rich white techies don't feel alienated. Plenty of space for big groups, but also seats at the bar to eat by yourself.\n\nThere's a kids corner (the owner clearly has kids) so you can bring the ankle biters along and stow them safely in the toy room, throwing them pieces of meat while you drink a beer and watch a game.\n \nBut the main thing is the barbecue, and it's basically all really really good. Ribs, briskets, pulled pork, salmon, you name it I've eaten it and its dope. \n\nThe Memphis ribs/barbecued shrimp combination is outstanding. \n\nThe Johnny Lee Burger is outstanding.\n\nThe sauces (my favorite is the vinegar sauce on the 'least hot' side of their bottle spectrum) are all excellent and creative.\n\nThe only sad part is that they discontinued their Texas beef rib last year when beef prices doubled. It was expensive, distressingly marbled with fat, and amazingly tasty. Bring back the Texas Beef Rib guys.", "author": "jack b."}

I took the easy route this year and went to a restaurant to get my BBQ fix.  Baby Blues BBQ has been on my radar for quite some time.  I always pass their establishment on my way into the Mission, but I'd never actually stopped in.  A peek at the Carnaval SF website that morning reminded me Baby Blues BBQ was a must for the weekend.  The restaurant is noted as a sponsor for the event, and having worked in the events business for the past two decades I know how important sponsors are to local events.\n\nI stopped in for linner.  That's the pre-4:00 PM pocket between lunch and dinner.  I had perused the menu adhered to the window before I walked in.  The space inside is certainly a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  Lots of communal tables and individual tables with a mish mash of different types of chairs, I'd say the interior is pretty cool.\n\nGreeted by a gentleman who asked me to take any seat I did so at a nice little table hidden from the sun's glare outside.  I was handed the menu which I handed right back.  I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs which includes cornbread and two sides dubbed \"fixins\" here.  The two sides I ordered were mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  I ordered a Coke to wash it all down with.\n\nSurprisingly, the wait was pretty short.  From experience I've come to expect longer waits at BBQ places but that wasn't the case here.  They screwed up my order.  Either that or they read my mind.  While perusing the menu outside and going down the list of sides I stopped and wondered what chicken smoked rice was but decided against trying new things.  Guess what they brought me instead of the mashed potatoes?  Yup, it was the chicken smoked rice!  The sides are huge here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GGdphTw9TXYGu1HPtNT3BA?select=6RgyPvOpB08JwfTYNR2G1A) as they are served in bowls equivalent to my rice bowls at home.  With the two big bowls of sides I was prepared to be stuffed.\n\nThe rice was very good.  There was no smoky flavor though, but the seasoning was quite good.  It was kind of like a slightly dirty rice.  I liked the cole slaw a lot because it was creamy without being overly so.  The seasoning in that was very good also.  The huge slab of cornbread was a bit hard and crusty along the edges but the heart of the bread was nice and moist with lots of corn kernels mixed into the batter.\n\nI loved the baby back ribs.  Served dry with a blackened, smoky rub the ribs were not fall off the bone but they were super meaty, moist and tender nonetheless.  There are four sauces to choose from and a bottle of vinegar with pickled hot peppers.  The molasses based sauce was just wrong for my taste and the XXX sauce had just one X too many for me as it quickly rose up my nostril and continued on instantly forming a teardrop at the edge of my eye.  I found the best sauce for me was actually a mix of the regular BBQ sauce and the Ginger Tabasco Sauce.  \n\nBaby Blues BBQ, sorry for ignoring your restaurant all this time.  I'll be back for more!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

We took a while to order because I couldn't decide what to eat. We started off with drinks, lemonade for me and Guinness for the man. Both enjoyed our drinks, no complaints here.\n\nI finally decided what to get. Boyfriend ordered the small plate of ribs with something else that I forgot with one side (mashed potatoes, which I ate 3/4 of while he wasn't looking). It wasn't fall off the bone and he didn't exceptionally hate it, but wasn't a fan of it either. To be honest, I thjnk he liked the mashed potatoes more than the ribs. Sadly, I had already devoured most of it before he could touch it, hahahah. I ordered the shrimp with two sides, sweet potato mash with macaroni and cheese. I loved the sweet potato mash, it was so damn good. I love sweet potatoes in every shape and form. I should've just ordered two orders of that instead!!! The shrimp was okay, nothing special. I didn't like the mac and cheese. It tasted a bit odd, not sure what it was but I just didn't like it at all.\n\nAfter finishing both the two mashes, I definitely wanted to get the hell out of there. Why? There was a man who came in right in the middle of our meal, who complained he did not get the right glass amount of wine. That was an annoyance. After that, it followed a couple ( who were possibly on a blind date or whatever ), where the guy just kept boasting about himself. I literally sat there with a WTF face.\n\nI may or may not come back, depending if I'm craving the mashes enough. Maybe on a regular weekday where it's not too overly crowded.\n\nwe parked about 3 blocks away, usually around that area it's a bit difficult to find parking.", "author": "Ann Z."}

We didn't want to drive all the way there for him to be disappointed. He had been craving bbq for forever and every time he ordered it, it didn't diminish his craving until we went to Baby Blues.\n\nWe did an extensive search on Google and Yelp and it led us to Baby Blues BBQ and it was near by my house. Kinda sorta. \n\nThere is plenty of street parking and we went on a Saturday afternoon. We got there at 12:30 and the place was completely empty. That kind of freaked me out. We ordered The Deuce and he got a side of 1/4 Chicken. He chose Coleslaw and Mac and Cheese for his sides. \n\nThe food came out pretty fast which wasn't a huge surprise considering we were the only ones there. This was a nice sunny Saturday mind you. I love that there are four different types of sauces on every table that look home made and they have cute names like Sassy Molassey. \n\nThe Deuce came with 6 BBQ shrimp with some sauce drizzled over it. I took a bite and bam, an explosion of flavor. It was soooo good. I couldn't believe it. These were jumbo meaty shrimps too. Nomnomnom. The mac and cheese looked disgusting but I couldn't stop eating it once I started! I almost didn't eat it too. The sauce wasn't really a sauce. It was just lots of melted cheese so it was really thick (and awesome). The coleslaw had a really strange taste that I couldn't put my finger on. My bf thinks it was mustard seed. It was good though. It also came with a huge slab of corn bread which I thought was just okay. I really only like super sweet corn cakes but my bf liked it. \n\nI can't say anything about the meat. I think my bf said it was kind of over cooked or something. He didn't finish all his chicken. The food is a little pricey but the 1/4 chicken is only 4.95 for some reason which is super cheap and the size was huge! You could definitely make a meal out of just that. \n\nWe didn't eat any dessert because we were stuffed and had to go to dinner later that night for my friends birthday at Esperpento (horrible btw, don't go!). \n\nThe decor was amazing! I loved it. Great job on mixing western and modern. I've never seen anything like it before. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated and clean. \n\nService was nice. I was surprised to see it was a hispanic run place. Pretty impressive. We didn't notice till after that they have a bunch of lunch specials that all the other patrons who finally came in later ordered. Its on the back of their menu and they are pretty reasonably priced. I think they were around $11.95. \n\nI asked for a take out menu but the owner (?) said they didn't have any because they're redoing  their menu and are reprinting menus. Eek! I hope they don't make any negative changes. I'll definitely be back. I didn't get a chance to really look at the menu since I was there primarily so my bf could finally get his bbq fix.\n\nUpdate 6/18/10\nI came here last night with my cousin and my bf at about 10 (they close at 11 on Friday nights). I was surprised to see it was pretty full but there were still two tables open so there wasn't a wait.\n\nI ordered the shrimp po boy for the cheap price of $8.50 but it wasn't very good.

I couldn't agree more.  In fact, if Baby Blues was in KC they would only get 2 stars, but since we're in a smokehouse-deprived city, they get 3.\n\nThe baby back ribs were not very tender and you had to gnaw to get the meat off the bone.  It's hard to find \"fall-off-the bone\" in SF.  The brisket was pulled, not sliced, and was kind of bland and tough.  The pulled pork was average, not as good as Sneaky's (though I dislike Sneaky's for other reasons).  In general, none of the meat was very smoky and you don't get that wonderful smoke ring or bark like you get in the Midwest.  The collards were standard, the pork and beans were unconventional - basically beans topped with pulled pork instead of beans cooked together with chunks of pork for better flavor.  The cornbread, however, was excellent - moist and finished on the grill, imparting some charred meaty flavor to the edges.  Also, their sauces are pretty good, especially the spicy one!\n\nBut the #1 thing I love about Baby Blues is that they have EXCELLENT SERVICE.  Our server was kind and friendly, she wasn't irritated when I took forever to decide what to order, and once I finally made that decision, she immediately told us how she could ring up our order differently to save us a buck while still getting exactly the same food.

In fact, as I'm writing this my mouth is watering just at the memory of last night!!!\n\nThe menu offers lots of combination plates do you don't need to choose one or the other from your barbecue favorites. For me personally though, I ordered the half rack of baby backs with two sides. And it was plenty!!! As I said at the beginning of my review, my ribs were rather fatty and made me wonder if they were not baby backs. Regardless, they were tasty, meaty and really good! The corn bread was so-so but then again not so important to me. Also I ordered the Baby Blue salad and it was de-lish. The  vegetarian baked beans looked to me like it was made with three beans not one kind. Really tasty! \n\nIt's easy to order too much food here! The BBQ smell when you walk in the door starts your taste buds working so by the time you order you want everything on the menu! \n\nI plan going back again. Well worth it..good service and good food. You'll thank me if you go!", "author": "Pam S."}

For our two sides, we choose the creamed spinach and the mac n' cheese. \n\nOverall, the pulled pork was hands down the best. It was oh-so-tender and well flavored. We particularly loved all the extra bbq sauces you could get- our favorites were the mild and the molasses sauces- both just a touch sweet and super yummy. The ribs were also good but unfortunately not the fall off the bone tender as we were hoping. The sides were flavorful as well with the mac n cheese made with a hint of bleu cheese and the creamed spinach both fresh and well seasoned. Add on some cornbread and were we satisfied!

To keep things simple, we went and ordered the largest party platter/dinner set available, and got corn bread, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potato salad, and a few other fixins along with the meats.\n\nOverall, not bad. I wasn't a huge fan of the pulled pork and brisket, as they were both a bit lacking in flavor, and on the dry side of things (though I suppose that's what the four different types of BBQ sauce they have available on the table are for). And while I didn't get around to trying the chicken, the two types of ribs they had were pretty damn good, with some great flavor and tender to boot, easily making them the best part of the meal.\n\nI can't say much for the fixins though, as nothing really stood out. The corn bread was good enough, while the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were okay, and the potato salad fairly lackluster.\n\nThe decor of the place was neat - lacking better interior design terms to describe it, I'd have to say it reminded me of a barn. A trendy barn. All the light fixtures were actually made out of various rusted metal pails and cans, which I thought was a neat touch.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the meal came out to a little under $20 a person. While most of what I tried there wasn't particularly noteworthy, the ribs are definitely worth trying out.", "author": "Johnny W."}

This came with corn bread and two sides - collard greens and mashed sweet potatoes for me. To say that the portions are generous is an understatement. \n\nThe Texas rib was tender, fatty and juicy, just like a short rib that's been braising for hours. This was a piece of meat that was BBQ'd, not baked, not roasted, not grilled, not boiled. At first glance it looks burnt, but cutting into it tells the whole story. I dipped pieces into some of the BBQ sauces, but it didn't really need it except to have the tangy sauce cut some of the richness of the meat. This is the first time I've had a beef rib with more meat than bone! I would be happy to order this over and over again. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a good smoky flavor. \n\nAs for the sides, the collard greens were okay. It wasn't prepared in the same manner as I've had at other BBQ restaurants, but they were fine. The mashed sweet potatoes were oozing butter. Quite delicious, if your name is Paula Deen. The corn bread was quite moist and tasted of corn. \n\nService was good and the food was served relatively quickly. They have a good variety of beers on tap, along with wine.

It was likely the prominence of the vintage neon Rexall Drugs sign that made us bypass Baby Blues, but I was alerted by a co-worker that indeed there was a rib joint under the sign (see my photos). Lo and behold, there it is in the Outer Mission near cool-crowd eateries like Blue Plate, Front Porch and Emmy's. \n\nInside you are struck by the hipster vibe of the place. This ain't no Everett & Jones, that's for sure, and there isn't much of a trace of its sister joint down in bustling Venice Beach. I'm only aware of the popular SoCal place through the Travel Channel. This location feels more isolated from a foot traffic standpoint, which left me to wonder if people are willing to seek it out. I guess they do since we were there on a Thursday evening and had to sit at the community table in front. That wasn't too bad since we had a clear view of the ukulele collection in the china hutch (see my photo). \n\nJamie ordered the $19.95 Smoked Baby Back Ribs, while I went for the $17.95 Memphis-Style Long Bone Pork Ribs (see my photos). Both were tender and tasty, especially when you squirt the hotter of the three squeeze bottles of sauce on the table. The sides should have been a slam dunk by comparison. They weren't. The Collard Greens were a complete miss...too watery, too salty to make even the bacon bits stand out. The Chicken Smoked Rice was just dirty rice that wasn't dirty enough for my taste. Jamie had better luck with the Mashed Potatoes (a no-brainer) and Blues on the Cob, although he even thought the cheese was superfluous to a good ear with butter. \n\nThe cornbread almost saved the day but just almost. Regardless, I have to give props to the service. Two girls kept coming by to make sure our glasses of Diet Coke were refilled. It's a little too pricey for me to make it a regular hangout, but I think the sandwiches - which are about half the price of the rib slabs - sound like a good deal. We'll be back, but I gotta try some other sides. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the ribs reign supreme, but the sides made me cry \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...oh yeah, uh-huh, need to listen to some blues \nSERVICE - 4 stars...like classic stewardesses on a Pan Am flight circa 1963 \nTOTAL - 4 stars...for the ribs they do right", "author": "Ed U."}

The base flavor of all the meat was vinegar. The brisket was chewy and dry. The link was OK. The long bone rib was good. Nice and juicy with a good flavor. I'm not sure why this place fails when it comes to the food but it seems like the food isn't fresh and it's not actually smoked. It's somewhat dirty in there and the service is slow.

The service was great, bartender was very attentive and informative. I ordered the \"Three Kings\" plate (bbq chicken, brisket, and Memphis style ribs). The plate came with a side and a corn muffin, I opted for the collard green, which were very tasty.\n\nThe ribs were great, excellent dry rub and cooked well, dare I even say perfectly for my tastes. If you want a \"fall off the bone\" rib, these are not for you, try the baby-back instead.\n\nThe brisket was ok, decent flavor but sliced thinly and overcooked. After I finished the ribs, the brisket had dried out, there was no moisture and it was very lean, none of the fatty, juicy pieces I've come to expect from places like 4505, Memphis Minnie's or Everett and Jones.\n\nThe corn muffin was a joke. It tasted like they had taken corn tortillas, soaked them in water and then mashed them up and put them in a muffin mold. There was nothing cornbread-y about it and had a chewy texture instead of being fluffy.\n\nLastly, the chicken was virtually un-edible. The rub tasted like they had used spices that expired years ago, leaving behind a cardboard, musky taste. I ate the wing, which aside from horrid flavor was actually cooked well. The breast on the other hand was a whole different story. I forced myself to try it, hoping the flavor of the wing was a fluke. Sadly the breast was worse than I imagined. It was dry, and had the same cardboard-like taste, not a trace of smoke flavor indicated that it had been bbq'd. Not only that, but the skin was also loose and soggy, which to me is an unforgivable offense.\n\nOverall, I wasn't blown away. I may be back to cherry-pick some things off the menu, only because it's the closest bbq joint to my work.

The collard greens were okay, i've had better and i've had worst but they weren't so bad, they were decent. The cornbread was average, i liked how this cornbread had corn in the mixture.

And the skin had a great snap when I bit into it!  \n\nAlong with all this, the plate came with a piece of cornbread and one side of my choice, which, in this case, was the Blues on the Cob.  The corn was grilled, sprinkled with Parmasian cheese and served with a lime wedge.  While not my first choice on how to serve corn, it was tasty.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my meal, even though it was a little rushed.  The next time I come in, I'll enjoy a nice, slow dinner, and probably order a Texas-style beef rib.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

We settled for it and it was ridiculous that they'd even serve something like that at a BBQ restaurant. Im not even sure where the pulled beef is from. It couldn't have been from a brisket because it was not smoked and not tender at all. Very disappointing meal. They alsoput the tiny cornbread on the main plate where the bottom got soggy from the meat juices. Who does that ? We ordered the meatballs and they were too burnt and not even round. The waitress had to go to the kitchen to ask what meat it was made of. Very disappointing. Memphis Minnie's all the way!", "author": "Jessica W."}

As much as I love pulled pork, the beef rib was like eating a steak on a dino-rib. Excellent. The Memphis ribs are great too and they alone are worth coming for, too. The 1/4 chicken also is shredded, and yet tender and moist - not easy to do with chicken! \n\nA bunch of sauces are on every table and more are available on request. A co-worker brought me here and we ordered/ate so much that ended up with seven bottles by the end of the meal.\n\nHolly is fantastic. She works behind the bar and covers the occasional table. Speaking bluntly and yet nicely is a rare quality, but she has it! She also made the surprisingly good suggestion that we try the mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and a bbq sauce. Collard greens were great too. Heck, I even liked the sweet potatoes. \n\nBaby Blues has a nice variety of beers that are priced for drinking 3-4, not just 1-2. And yet, they're quick to refill water glasses too. That's a rare combination in my experience.", "author": "Mike H."}

I tried the original sauce which was nothing too special, and the sassy molasses which tastes like your standard bbq sauce. There was one more sauce on the table, ginger tabasco I believe which I opted not to try. I really enjoyed the corn bread which was packed with corn kernels.

Tonight, I know why. \n\nBaby Blue BBQ ranges from very mediocre to not good. I'm annoyed that they do both pulled and sliced brisket and they don't even tell you the difference on the phone and they default to the pulled brisket which is very bland and somewhat tough. Don't get the pulled brisket--it will ruin your concept of brisket and bbq in general. The ribs are always a little bit too dry--all of the styles. Their bbq sauce is a highlight, some spicy, some sweet, not too vinegary. \n\nThe sides here used to be my consolation for so-so meat, but the sides have definitely gone down hill. Not what they were a few years back when they opened. You can read it all in the previous reviews: The mac-n-cheese is soupy, the creamed spinach is very unconventional (in a bad way), the collard greens are standard but very average, the sweet potato mash has lost all flavor over the years and the cornbread is greasy with too much butter and dry pieces of corn. \n\nOverall, not a good place to eat, and I think I wil never eat from there again by choice. Too many great places to eat, to waste my time and money on this place.

And I love how there are signs up still advertising \"DRUGS.\" \n\nBaby Blues BBQ made such a fantastic first impression on us that we came back twice in one week. I couldn't get my mind off of them. Here are my notes:\n\nVisit #1: Late lunch: we walk into an enormous space with Bob Marley on the speakers & are greeted by our waitress telling us to take a seat anywhere we'd like (the only other patrons were at the bar, enjoying their liquid lunch, i assume.) We pass up the communal table & the bar & opt for a seat on the bench along the wall. \n\nThe lunch specials, served from 12-4pm, are well priced at under $13 for sandwiches & meats combos, but I noticed their \"platters\" are priced higher than other BBQ joints in the city. We shared \"The Blue Devil:\" 4 meats & 3 \"fixins\" for $31.95. (Roadside BBQ on Geary charges $23 & i think Memphis Minnies does 3 meats/2 sides for $20.) \n\nTheir BBQ shrimp, which I've never had at a BBQ joint, gets 5 stars. They were large, a little spicy from the sauce & grilled to perfection. Honestly, they were the reason we came back. I also really enjoyed their sides; blues on the cob (sprinkled w/ cheese) & mac & cheese were both excellent.\n\nI could take or leave: their brisket (pulled & shredded--never seen brisket done this way before) & their beef ribs, which were meaty but also fatty. (Not all beef ribs are fatty--case in point: the ones from Roadside BBQ.) Their corn bread is moist & full of corn, but there is a spice in it (which I can't identify) that gives it a pungent taste I don't particularly care for. \n\nDid not try: pulled pork & chicken smoked rice. According to the bf, both were so-so.\n\nTheir BBQ sauces are watery, but still quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Ginger Tabasco the most. \n_________________________________\n\nVisit #2: Late dinner, right before they were set to close. We walk in & are seated near the ukuleles. The place looks different when dim; definitely very festive w/ Christmas lights & dancehall playing loudly. I'm seeing details & decorations I missed the first time around & dig the eclectic mishmash of items. \n\nWe order \"Big Blue\" which is 3 meats w/ 2 fixins for $25.95. They ran out of BBQ chicken (which the bf was excited to try) so in addition to baby back ribs, we doubled up on our shrimp order. The shrimp were as succulent as we remembered (altho I think we were a few shrimp shy of a double portion...) Their baby back ribs were wonderful; it had a nice crust & wasn't too smoky. Again, the sides (mashed potatoes w/ some skin left in it & baked beans) were a hit. I liked their banana pudding, but the bf commented it just tasted like banana flavored whipped cream (which means I don't have to share.)\n\nWe've been here once when it was pretty empty & once when it was packed & our servers have always been great; they're quick & get our orders right. Love the location, love the atmosphere & most importantly, love (most of the) food. With flavors & quality this good, it's no wonder Baby Blues BBQ's got a serious hold on our attention.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I've been here several times on different days at different times, but the moral of the story is always lackluster when compared to the original. \n\nThe service is always a little on the slow side. I've only been taken care of promptly once, when I sat a the bar. Every other time the tiny restaurant is only about half-full and I end up waiting and waiting and waiting for everything.\n\nThe sweet tea has a funny flavor. \n\nThe mac and cheese is soggy (when it's supposed to be baked and almost crisp). \n\nThe brisket is chewy and the last time I came in, it was served cold, as though someone had refrigerated it and then re-heated it when I ordered it. That's possibly the most infuriating part of my disappointment. The Baby Blues in Venice has an open kitchen and the bar surrounds the *KITCHEN* so you can sit and watch your brisket being slow-cooked, your chicken and ribs get bbqed, and your shrimp get flamed. It's fun to sit at the counter every once in a while and see your order get put together. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the SF location sincerely cooks everything ahead of time and re-heats it, but the customer probably shouldn't be aware of that. In fact, we should live in the fantasy that a guy up to his elbows in barbecue sauce is starting to grill our chicken as soon as we order it.\n\nBecause if he isn't starting it when we place our order, why do I have to wait *SO LONG* for my food? It's confusing. \n\nAnyway, the creamed spinach is excellent here regardless and the meat is still *good* even if it isn't freshly made or whatever. So if you want BBQ, this place is fine but if you ever find yourself in LA, go to the place in Venice and tell them Olga sent you.", "author": "Olga A."}

I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the first trip (even though they ran out of food and only had a couple of things left to order) but I've seen enough. This place is simply not good and getting worse. \n\n*** Caveat: I am from Texas and I grew up eating BBQ ***\n\nLast night we got shrimp, brisket, mac/cheese, okra, cornbread, spinach, rice. The shrimp was the only thing on the place that was OK. They were overcooked slightly but seasoned well. The rice was edible but completely forgettable. It all goes downhill from there...\n\nThe brisket is so far removed from \"good brisket\" that I can't really do it justice. It's dry and stringy beef. They carve it along the bias, rather than against it, which is a major no-no. You will chew this stuff for days. There's no crust and no juiciness. Major fail.\n\nThe mac and cheese seemed like it had gone through a food processor or a blender. It was just cheesy mush without any discernable structure of noodle. (How is it possible to mess up mac and cheese?)\n\nThe \"creamed spinach\" is basically raw/blanched spinach with some white sauce slapped on it. Zero flavor. Fail.\n\nThe okra had giant, fibrous stalks in it that were basically inedible. Every third or forth bite, I had to reach into my mouth and pull out a 3\" long mess of plant stalk that simply refused to break down in my chewing.\n\nLast (and possible least) is the cornbread. I have had much better out of a box. It's either soaked in butter or oil (probably to make it less dry?) but it's a dense brick of a corn-tasting substance and I felt dirty for eating it.\n\nI will gladly drive across town to Memphis Minnies from here on out.

Well none of us felt like cooking and after we rattled off several restaurants in walking distance this was the only one that had consensus.  We have eaten here probably 5 times or so--so we knew what to expect that night: decent BBQ, decent sides, interesting beer choices, and great service from the cool server with the leopard spots. \n\nFirst clue that things were off--she wasn't there. A blond from behind the bar showed us to a table. Service was slow, taking forever to actually come around to take our order--but it was only after we ordered and had drained our drinks that we started getting suspicious that things were way off. No offer for refills, in fact we didn't see the server again as she just never came by, and the food was still not in sight. I kid you not--1 hour after walking in was when we finally got served. Temperatures of the food were inconsistent--yes there were 5 of us in the group but you don't leave some of the plates waiting and cooling while you apparently go slaughter the cow for the next meal. \n\nThis review is mostly for this night of horrendous service. Soggy corn bread. Flavorless sweet potatoes (I'm guessing they ran out of molasses or whatever they usually put in), barely warm meat and mashed potatoes, wrong sides for one of the party (but he didn't complain because he knew it would be forever for the correct side to come). \n\nWhat went from us thinking this was a one off to something personal was watching the blond server greet some customers she obviously knew. Beers on the table within five minutes of sitting down. No delays in their food. The blond obviously took a dislike to us and ignored us. The cook---I don't know if all the regulars took off that day, but he was obviously out of his league. \n\nI agonized about writing this review. I wanted to contact management but there was nothing on their website. I want this restaurant to succeed as we all LOVE BBQ.  On the other nights, when service was great (pretty server with the leopard spots) the BBQ was decent (at best) the sides better (not great) and beer plentiful it was the whole package that I would have generously given a 4 star review.  This review would be a one star but I have to balance it out for our previous meals there. I really hope this was a one off night, for the sake of the restaurant.

You have to take the bitchy people who are not coherent and that can't spell with a grain of salt in reading these reviews. They are unfair and clearly not getting laid.\n\nI moved here recently from Portland, Oregon - which media has been in love with the past few years as THE new culinary city to pay attention to. I feel this is a fair assessment and I feel like I've been spoiled there - so hopefully that counts for something. I understand that one off experiences could have been bad - there is always that chance. However, tonight my boyfriend (who has been here a couple of times and has been suggesting it repeatedly) finally got me to check it out. I am originally from Walla Walla in Washington State, where BBQ is king and my dad is the master of hunting, curing and preparing meats. (I have really awesome deer meat jerky in my fridge right now that he made - yes, really.) What I loved about it:\n\n1. I was able to order a nice mix of veggie-oriented foods (great salad with awesome onion vinaigrette, corn on the cob with some yummy cheesy seasoning, and mac-n-cheese) so I didn't feel like typical BBQ places where you eat a ton of meat and then moan because it takes forever to digest it all.\n\n2. The meat: I had BBQ shrimp and it was awesome - not overcooked, but great with the variety of sauces. My boyfriend had catfish and it was also very tasty.\n\n3. If you like decent wine and totally have gotten used to the crap selection in most places that are not super high end in this city - you will be very pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend is European and I'm a wine snob and they have Sencerre on the menu....at a BBQ place! We found out the owner's partner is French and picked the wines - nice work!\n\n4. For dessert we ate apple pie that had just come out of the oven and it was amazing. Enough said.\n\n5. The service was great. I'm straight, but the young women were super cute and sweet and total eye candy. The owner talked us up when we asked him if it was his place and was really nice too. \n\nWe will definitely be back and will also be ordering from them for 4th of July - as they are doing specials where they marinade and prep the ribs and chicken and make you look really good on your home grill.", "author": "Rachel K."}

It's kinda like how I grill/bbq some of my food on the Weber grill and forget about the food because I was doing something else that the food ends up getting a little burnt but then it's all good because you can tell it's homemade. \n\nThe cool little bar where they also have a plasma for sports is perfect for selecting BB's as a guy's night out dinner. \n\nTheir ribs shine, while the baby back rib's are tastier than the beef brisket. The brisket was a little grainy and kinda resembled a wet mop on a plate. \n\nOh my, the sides. We had a group of 4 hungry guys so I had a chance to taste a whole bunch. \n\n1. Mac and cheese - baked, cheesiness, nice crust. my favorite one\n2. mashed sweet potatoes - delicious, smooth, sweet, warm, hug. \n3. pork and beans - beans with tons of pulled pork, could also be a meal by itself for lunch \n4. corn on the cob - this like the rib is gigantic, grilled. \n5. potato salad - it had a tart zing to it, interesting\n6. cream of spinach - not pureed and creamy like HOPR style, whole spinach boiled down with milk sauce. aiight\n\nMy new favorite BBQ joint. Not a place that you'll eat once a week, but def a place if you're looking for good Q.\n\nIf you want to feel like a man, eat here.", "author": "Earl G."}

My Mom mixed BBQ sauce in my baby formula, and when I outgrew that, they practically raised me at Shorty's in South Florida. We have never found BBQ in the Bay Area we thought was worth eating other than my homemade BBQ chicken (with my homemade BBQ sauce). See my review of Boss Hawg's in Topeka if you want to get idea of what we like in the way of 'cue. \n\nA friend told us about Baby Blues a few months ago and tonight we gave it a try. Not great, but not too bad either - the best BBQ we've had in the Bay Area. But as my partner said, that's not saying much.\n\nWe ordered a half rack of ribs, a beef brisket platter, and mac and cheese and baked beans sides. The good news - the ribs were quite good 0 a little on the dry side, but tasty and meaty. I'd definitely have 'em again.The brisket was pretty tasty too. We both liked the sauces - I preferred the regular sauce, while partner preferred the sweet. \n\nThe bad news - the sides. The beans - tasteless. Ditto the mac and cheese. The cornbread was downright bad, not identifiable as cornbread. Zero corn flavors in that overly moist glop. Probably the worst I've ever had of all three of those dishes. \n\nMy impression is that Baby Blues is trying to do too much, and it doesn't do anything all that well. Texas, Memphis, and Carolina BBQ are all on the menu. The place might be better served by just concentrating on one style, and doing it well. \n\nWe'll probably go back just 'cause there's nothing much else around, and hope we can find some better sides.", "author": "David G."}

Some, the sides.  Me, the deal maker or breaker is always the chicken.  And let me tell you, the chicken is finger licking, no, entire hand and chin licking good.  One thing that tells you a lot about good barbeque is the meat.  This meat does not have to be slathered in sauce to have a lot of flavor - it falls off of the bone and has just the right amount of smoke.\n\nI tried the \"Suicide King\" to start - pulled pork on top of cornbread with slaw and cheese - delicious.  Huge and filling (4 portions) so you will want to share otherwise you will definitely kill your appetite - hence, the Suicide.\n\nFor my main, I had the \"Mason Dixon\", half Memphis Ribs and a quarter chicken.  The chicken was as described above, and the pork ribs were tender, juicy, not at all greasy, and with just the right amount of char.  There are 3 sauces to try at the table - regular, XXX, and a peppered vinegar - all good, but honesty the meat doesn't need them.\n\nSides.  Important and hard to get right.  You get 2 with your entree and I had the Collard Greens and \"blues on the cob\", grilled corn with Chipotle butter and cheese.  The collards were excellent - highly recommend.  Not too mushy and spiced just right.  The corn was good, well cooked, but surprisingly more bland than I expected.  The cornbread - now that was a treat.

I ordered the brisket platter and for my sides I had mac and cheese and creamed spinach and it came with cornbread. The brisket was average and the sauces did nothing for me, a little too watery for my taste. The mac and cheese was runny and was basic. I was expecting creamed spinach on the level of a steakhouse style. Nope, it was chopped spinach in a watery creamy consistency. The cornbread had a ton of corn kernels in it, if you're into that.

I placed the order and the confirmation stated the delivery time was in one hour.  Not bad considering it was a Sunday night and I expected that would be the length of time.\n\nI ordered the \"Blue Devil\" - choice of four meats and three sides (Slow Smoked Chicken, Shrimp, Pork Ribs, Texas Ribs, Corn Bread, Potato Salad, Baby Blue Salad) and one piece of pie.  This sounded like a lot of food but I was sharing with my roommate and we thought it sounded right for two people.  We were wrong.  \n\nI received a call 10 minutes after placing the order and was told that they had run out of corn bread (my favorite item) and I needed to make another selection.  Not very apologetic but I thought \"this stuff happens\".  \n\nThe delivery arrived earlier then they stated but was missing the Texas Ribs.  I did receive 1 burnt chicken wing with some breast meat, 5 dry grilled shrimp and 1 Beef Rib.  (I thought when you put an \"s\" at the end of a word it meant \"MORE THAN ONE\").  The side dishes were all in tiny deli containers and hardly more than a few bites.\n\nI called the restaurant and it took them 20 minutes to find the original order.  They  determined that a mistake was made when they placed the order into the kitchen and offered to send the missing item(s) in 45 minutes.  Dinner was over.  They weren't apologetic or even concerned that they had ruined my dinner and the items that did arrive were overcooked and uneatable.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told \"he was working the grill and couldn't come to the phone\".  I think this restaurant should take a hard look at how they take To-Go orders and if they can't handle it then they shouldn't do it!  Also, keep the manager managing and not cooking - I hope he is better at that.\n\nThe poor food quality, slew of errors and poor customer service had firmly determined that I will never patronize this place again.", "author": "Jon S."}

Looked at the platters on the menu and saw that everything was quite pricey ($13 - $30 (for 4 different kinds of meat in your patter, expensive O_O)), first bad thing I noticed. So being as pricy as it is, I thought it better be pretty damn good.

Took it home and popped it open to find that the beef brisket portion was quite small, but the sides were nice sized. \n\nLooking at the brisket it looked kinda over cooked and stiff. Took a bite and found out my theory was correct. It was not tender at all. Good thing I asked for a lot of BBQ sauce because I had to use it with every bite I took. Sad to say I ate it all because I was very hungry, otherwise I might have fed it to my dog, who might have been skeptical as well about eating it. \n\nNext the mac n cheese, it did not taste bad I have to say, but it did not taste like mac n cheese. It tasted more like a bland white sauce pasta dish with some spices in it. The macaroni was cooked perfectly though, soft and tender.\n\nThe sweet potato was alright, very plain and tasted healthy. There was nothing much to it besides sweet potato in it, not like the fancy kinds with cinnamon or marshmallows in it. \n\nLast the cornbread, it was okay, kinda crispy on the outside and gooey soft on the inside, but nothing special. \n\nWas not very satisfied with this spot and probably would never come back.", "author": "Patrick L."}

It's not beating out my current SF BBQ ave Memphis Minnies but it'll do in a pinch.  Next time I'll be sure to try something other than ribs.

It's not horrible, mind you, but... meh.\n\nI will say that in BBQ options in SF are scarse, so it's to their credit that they offer this cuisine. So if you have that hankerin' this grub will hit the spot.\n\nIf nothing else, the creamed spinach is some of the best I've ever had.

Everything was just \"pretty good.\"\n\n------\n\nBest BBQ restaurant I've been to in San Fran.\n\nHad the half rack Memphis with 1/4 white meat chicken, collared greens, and mac'n'cheese.  \n\nRibs were very good, not incredible.  Like the dry rub style.  While the meat was tender, the outside was a bit over cooked.  I'm into the contrast, but I think the outside should have been less tough.  Still, very good, and great with the sauces.  \n\nI used the \"Original Sauce\" and then mixed it with one of their hotter sauces, which I think was Tabasco-based.  That's not my thing because Tabasco, if it actually was that, has such a unique flavor it almost dominates the hot.  Rather they use a lesser known sauce; something I'm not familiar with.  However, I mixed the two, and again, damn good.\n\nChicken was cooked to PERFECTION.  The Moms made a legendary chicken, and my friends back in Jersey have won AWARDS (www.localsmokebbq.com) for their chicken.  This was damn good chicken.\n\nCollared greens used a tomato based sauce, and I love that.  Might have been my favorite thing, which is rare for me.  Could have eaten a bucket of the greens.\n\nMac and Cheese was fluffy, tasty, and perfectly cooked.  LOVE it.\n\nHad a Marzen beer by Gordon Biersch, which is a brew I really like a lot.\n\nAll told, cost me around $29, which is about $4-5 too pricey, but still worth it.\n\nPlus the Giants lose to the Phillies, AGAIN, which was nice.\n\nFor San Fran BBQ, as good as it gets, yes.", "author": "David W."}

And as is often the case with large groups, you don't know exactly how many people are going to show up. The day before the event (!) I was able to make a reservation for 20 people around a massive table with lots of stools, so we were easily able to handle fluctuations in headcount. The food was solid, the ambience was great, the service was good, and the prices were reasonable. They offer big family-style set-price selections of sides, meats, etc. Their suggested serving sizes are huge -- we ordered the platter designated for 16, and our group of ~22 couldn't finish everything -- so unless everyone is ravenous you can go down a size or two on the platter choices.

It's a heaping pile of baby back ribs and Memphis-style ribs, where all the meat falls cleanly off the bone and absolutely melts in your mouth like butter. It's so good it's getting hard for me to branch out into other menu items. I really want to try the shrimp and the pulled pork. NEXT TIME, I swear!\n\nTry the kansas-style BBQ sauce (it's vinegar based) for a sweet-tangy splash of flavor. I could eat a whole mountain of their mac n' cheese, which I think has blue cheese or swiss in it or something....there's definitely some that makes you go \"What IS that on my tongue?!\" in a good way, of course! Also be sure to check out their mashed sweet potato (vitamin A, guys) and creamed spinach. Oh, and wash it all down with some ice cold Shiner Bock for extra street cred. It's a hard beer to find in SF.\n\nAnother thing that really sticks out in my mind is how friendly EVERYONE who works there is.

This place did not disappoint.  It was like being in Texas again except for the pierced and tattooed black-clad wait staff.  These guys and gals were all friendly and into the food that is served there.  Our waitress helped us to pair the cue to the beer (or visa versa).  She also explained all of the meat types.\n\nThe smell of wood barbecue walking up to the place is fantastic.  Leave all pretense at home.  This is a neighborhood joint.  Close in tables.  basic benches.  no frills.  The menu is (of course) meat heavy but, believe it or not, there are vegetarian options in the form of classic sides.  I asked jokingly about vegan options...I think that many of the sides are vegan!\n\nYou order your meat selection and then the sides.  The sauteed okra was phenomenal.  NONE of the drooly slime that is associated with okra and mercifully, not breaded and fried.  The seasoning was spot on and the okra was actually crunchy (but cooked) not mushy.  It was in fresh tomato sauce.  The cole slaw was also delicious.  Crunchy and not too sweet or creamy. Perfect.  The mashed sweet potatoes were also very good.\n\nThe bar is beer and wine.  The beer selection is pretty good (including Shiner Bock a Texas classic).   The ribs were really good.  Juicy, smokey, tasty and not drenched in barbecue sauce.  The chicken similarly, was moist and not over cooked to dust.\n\nThere are many options for bbq sauces from classic tomato base, tabasco base, molasses base, and habanero based.  Sweet to heat.  Choose your poison.  It is right on the table for you to enjoy.\n\nRhubarb-strawberry and -apple pie and classic banana pudding were on the menu for dessert.  Tragically, they were out of S-R pie and we had to have the apple. Tasty. not too sweet.  Crunchy apples.  LOVED it.", "author": "Carlos R."}

But having said that, Baby Blues is definitely worth a visit.  \n\nAs a converted drugstore/converted retro curio store, it's not the most inviting space, and at our table it was dark enough so that I had to go stand under a light at the other end of the restaurant to read my menu.  Plus, I didn't like the Led Zep they played over the sound system -- not the best for mood or for digestion.  But the food was by and large very good.  If you don't like eating large quantities of cheese, don't get the mac and cheese, but it was rich beyond belief.  Many of their side dishes are also great, like the potato salad -- I could have eaten that for several hours.\n\nThe beef brisket was, by the reports, really good.  That came in a very healthy-sized portion -- as did the \"Texas BBQ Special,\" which we had no idea what it was when we ordered it except that they were beef, and most of the other ribs they had were pork.  Indeed, when they arrived, the Texas Specials literally dwarfed the plates they came on.  I had no idea that ribs came in such giant, Fred Flintstone sizes - I mean, the rib bones were close to 13\" x 2\", so large that the ends of the bones poked out of the clamshells we took their remains home in.  And they were so massive that it took several minutes of sawing away to separate the ribs from each other so that they could be successfully maneuvered into the mouth.  A little chewy, but tasty as well as memorable.\n\nPlus, you gotta love a place that not only has Pabst on tap, but serves Kool-Aid on top of that.", "author": "moosedog i."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-11", "description": "This is by far the most Californified-BBQ I've ever had - not in a good way at all. The ribs smelled good but did not fall off the bone. The sauce comes in stingy tiny little cups and while kind of tasty, is more like yummy salsa than BBQ sauce (was there cumin in that? and chipotle peppers for heaven's sake?). The cornbread was \"re-imagined\" in some dark-molasses or whole wheat (?) kind of way that was NOT tasty - it was kind of spongy and dense and didn't taste much of, say, corn. The sweet potato was just a mashed sweet potato - no seasoning whatsoever and mushy. The greens were still tough and cooked entirely without meat - and they weren't even the right kind of greens. Oh my god and the mac&cheese. No. Just No. The noodles had a weird mushy texture, like gluten-free pasta does sometimes. and the sauce was watery, like I had to get a spoon just so there'd be any cheese in my mouth when I ate the noodles. And it was so bland - it was mostly milk. Cheese didn't really factor into it. Really awful Mac & cheese.\n\nOK - an aside - but Greens (by which I mean soul food greens served typically with BBQ) are made from a cabbage relative (kale, collards, mustard greens, etc.) and they should be cooked for a LONG time and flavored with ham/bacon and other delicious things to make them good, and make the broth they soak in so good you eat it too. They are the food of people without a lot of options, made miraculously delicious by great effort and addition of whatever could possibly help them. It is NOT the same thing to take some greens (was it kale? or was it mustard greens?) and cut it with swiss chard (a spinach relative, made for people with weak palates who don't like flavor) and cook it for a little while (too long for chard, not long enough for greens) with no meat to flavor it (the ham is needed because these greens do not taste naturally delicious) and no delicious broth and as far as I can tell no seasoning at all.  Now I've eaten delicious swiss chard and enjoyed it, when it was cooked the way swiss chard should be - sauteed with onions and lots of butter, for example. But swiss chard should not be cooked like greens and greens need a lot of help that swiss chard can't provide. I mean, come on.\n\nWell, so I give it more than 1 star only because it was not disgusting, but it was extremely disappointing when I was so looking forward to BBQ that night and my regular place was closed already Baby Blues was open late and still serving and it smelled smoky and good inside the restaurant (but I knew from the decor it was going to be some white white white BBQ in this bag) and well, that's exactly what I got when I got home and settled in for some long-awaited ribs.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

I don't know what disappointed me the most, the crappy ribs or the ridiculous prices.\n\nThe sole highlight was the texas style rib which was one huge meat bone and it was tasty! I got the Big Blue which was 25 dollars for three meats and 2 sides and it was additional 4 dollars to get the texas style ribs. The other two meats I got were the pulled pork and the brisket both of which should be fork tender and melt in your mouth. They were both really tough and it seemed like there were so many BBQ sauces to pick from to help soften up and flavour the meat. I went back again think perhaps they just got some poor meat or just rushed the smoking and cooking process but it has the same toughness.\n\nThe sides were equally disappointing, the collard greens were bitter, the okra slimey and the creamed spinach was runny and all three were served cold.\n\nCombined the low quality of the food with high prices this not a place I would return for a third time.\n\nBoth times we went there, there no more than a dozen people there but the service was non-existant and it was very cold inside.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

Six if I could.\n\nI came in here for takeout today, and even though the place was empty, someone was waiting right by the door and greeted me the minute I came in. He took my order lickety-split, and was sooo on top of things.\n\nI was in and out of there in no more than 10-15 minutes. It was amazing. It was also some of the best takeout packaging I've ever gotten--a nice paper bag with handles (like a gift bag), a generous supply of napkins and wet-naps, plastic utensils, the works. The food was in leakproof packaging. And even though they do have fountain drinks there, they gave me cans of soda in my bag--so much easier to carry away!\n\nWe got a beef brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, and sides of mashed sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. The sandwiches were hot and came with a yummy slaw on top of the meat. The meat was perfectly cooked, though I thought it could have used a bit more seasoning. The buns were toasty.\n\nThere was one thing that I both loved and hated. The sandwiches came completely devoid of BBQ sauce, which was good in the sense that they weren't all soaked and soggy when we went to eat them. On the other hand, we were given 4 smallish containers of BBQ sauce, 2 of them very spicy and two of them mild. Even if we had each used both (and I couldn't use more than a little of the spicy one, 'cause I'm a wimp) there really wouldn't have been enough sauce for my taste. I think I probably could have gotten more sauce from them, or switched out the spicy for more mild, buuuut since it was my first time ordering from them, I didn't know.\n\nI'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, but my husband said his were great. Meanwhile my mac and cheese was ASTOUNDINGLY good--lots of gorgonzola in the mix. And the portions of the sides were more than generous. I actually ended up mostly sticking to my mac and cheese, saving my sandwich for when I could go home and use our big bottle of BBQ sauce on it, and I was still totally stuffed before I was even done with it.", "author": "Lynae Z."}

The service was awesome and the server was relaxed and personable to each of his tables although it was an incredibly busy dinner hour.\n\nHowever, the meat was not that spectacular. I guess I shouldn't be picky about bay area BBQ, but I felt like it could have been better. I felt that the meat in the pork and ribs was little over-cooked, and thus, lacked any meat taste. The brisket, however, did taste pretty good, although the texture was not as juicy as I prefer. I think it was probably attributed to the fact it was dinner hour and they were really busy.  Although advised to order medium, our fellow diner ordered his burger rare, and it turned out to be mushy and tasteless. \n\nIf I do return to Baby Blues, I'm definitely getting a medium-cooked burger with mac&cheese! and bottomless kool-aid, may I say more?", "author": "Jen G."}

You have to go in and just experience whatever they're offering, and you enjoy it or you don't. \n\nThe only place I get seriously legit Southern food in the Bay Area is at mine or my Southern diaspora friend's places.\n\nThey have four sauces. One tasted like it had cardamom in it, and I actually thought it was pretty good. Sweeter than I usually like, but really good. There's a Tabasco Ginger sauce, pickled hot peppers in vinegar (which I love), and a few others.  Good rub on the baby back ribs, Memphis ribs were good, as were the beef ribs. Lots of pepper in the rub and the sauces were nice and tangy, not bland like the other spots I've been here. Salt, people. Salt.\n\nThis isn't Memphis, people. This is San Francisco.

It's not a negative comment, but rather a true reflection of the harsh reality.  The building where Baby Blues is located used to be a Rexall Drugstore, and the old DRUGS sign is still there.  The much more modest neon \"BBQ\" sign almost pales in comparison.  Less than a half block away, the old gun store proudly is identified by the menacing GUNS sign.  The point I am trying to make is this: it's a perfect location for this kind of place.\n\nWhen you walk in, you feel as though you entered a large kitchen or a small barn.  Sure, the bar, the flat screen TVs and the contemporary art on the walls might remind you of a trendy restaurant, but . . .  The ratty checkered tablecloths, wobbly tables and mismatched chairs make you wonder whether you wandered into someone's garage by mistake.  Then you see a giant BBQ pit, and you don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nThe hostess and the waiters are all incredibly nice.  While the food does take a long time (I did wonder if they had forgotten our orders), they really try to take care of you.  They refilled my soda at least 3 times before our food came out, and I didn't even have to ask.  You don't expect great service in a place like this, but you do get it at Baby Blues.  I should have ordered the Kool-Aid ($2, unlimited refills) just because.  Can you think of a place that has Kool-Aid on the menu?  I can't.\n\nNow, for the food itself.  I had the pulled pork plate.  For $13.95, it comes with two sides and a piece of cornbread.  I was not impressed with the pulled pork itself, and neither was my friend.  We agreed that it tasted a bit \"watery,\" like pork from a can would.  I felt like it tasted more boiled than it did BBQ'd.  We also shared a 1/2 lb of brisket ($6.50), which did not look or feel like 1/2 lb.  The brisket was also shredded and looked very much like the pork, but tasted much better.  It was more solidly cooked and more BBQ'd.  \n\nThe sides were definitely the best part of the meal, which is not exactly a ringing endorsement for a BBQ place.  My friend actually ordered The Sidecar (4 sides + cornbread), and that may have been the way to go.  My mac 'n' cheese was gooey and delicious, with crunchy breadcrumb crust.   The mashed sweet potatoes were a bit runny, but delicious nonetheless.  The cornbread was a different story.  Baby Blues cornbread is different, and nobody likes different.  It was darker, harder and sweeter than what I would expect cornbread to be.  I love corn and I finished the whole piece, but it just wasn't that great.  \n\nThe bill for the three of us (3 dinners, extra side of brisket, 3 beers and a soda) was $70+tip.  Definitely not a cheap dinner, but not a bank breaker, either.  I'd probably come back here again, but I am not going to expect anything super authentic and out of this world.  You shouldn't, either.", "author": "Yan G."}

They tasted good, but they were extremely dry, the point of being inedible.  But, I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nMy boyfriend and I took my mom here (who has been eager to try this place since we came awhile back) for her birthday.  We arrived just before 5 pm this past Sunday.  We walked in, and the bartender looked at us and decided to help the people that came in AFTER us, who apparently came in to get take-out.  There's no sign that says \"wait to be seated\", so we weren't sure if we should just try to find our own seats.  There were a total of 6 people seated at tables eating/ordering, and about 4 people at the bar.  It appeared that there was only one waitress for the whole place.\n\nThe bartender finally looks up and asks us how many?  3.  Then he basically tells us to sit wherever.  Thanks, we couldn't have figured that out a couple minutes ago.  We sit down, and a waitress brings us the menus.  The bartender comes to take our orders.  I had the Memphis style ribs, with baked beans and mashed potatoes, the boyfriend ordered the brisket with mashed potatoes, blues corn on the cob, and added a hot link, and mom had the baby back ribs with coleslaw.  Mom and I had tea and boyfriend had a beer.\n\nFood was delivered in a timely fashion, but the waitress neglected to refill our glasses, and didn't leave us with the barbecue sauce for the ribs.  Mom's ribs and cole slaw were great, she loved them.  Boyfriends brisket was delish, and the hot link was NOT hot.  They did give him 2 hot links for $3.50, even though the order said 1.  My ribs were DRY DRY DRY!  The mashed potatoes were okay, but they have parmsean cheese, and I swear to GOD, it's the kind out of the green Kraft can!  The corn had it sprinkled on top too!  Bleck.  The cornbread is the weirdest combination of greasy and dry.  Horrible.  I remember it was like that the last time we went.  My baked beans tasted just like chili.  They were disgusting.  \n\nAt some point in the middle of our meal, our waitress left and a new one took over.  One table of 2 people got up and left, and another table of 6 arrived.  We were never told \"goodbye, and here's my replacement\" by the original waitress, no one came to check and see how everything was, no one offered refills or more drinks.  We were clearly finished eating when the new waitress took my boyfriends beer glass away, but she never offered to clear our plates, or ask if we wanted to take anything home.  It took about 20 minutes to get our bill, and that was from the bartender, and they STILL never cleaned our table.  I was livid, I have never received such horrible service, certainly not in a restaurant that was as slow as it was then!\n\nOh, and the grand total for our \"authentic\" BBQ?  $76.00, PLUS TIP.  We only left $10, and in my opinion, that was too much.  It should have been more like $5.  Well, we can cross another \"authentic\" BBQ place off the list.", "author": "Priscilla D."}

The place is pretty spotless, an old drug store without much signage and the only way you know there's food inside is seeing all the people eating.\n\nThe night I came the kitchen was backed up, food came out intermittently, and servers had lots of personality.  That's okay, I wasn't in a hurry.  Also, the music and video selection were pretty random, electronica / dance music if I recall.\n\nWell, most of the meat was well cooked and smoked, with sauce to add later.  The sauces were good but all the meat I tried (chicken, grilled shrimp, pork ribs) was delicious as it is, so the sauce was just an afterthought.  Collard greens were delicious, and their cornbread is a story by itself - molasses and other dark stuff, it's as dark as carrot cake.\n\nIt can be either very cheap or very expensive.  The key is, one $20-$25 plate is plenty for two people unless you're completely famished.  So dinner for two with one big plate, an extra side, a beer, tax and tip, can come in at $40.

I am from the South, and I know how to make and eat Southern food.  And at most junctures, this place seems to make the wrong decision, deciding instead of hallowed tradition to take some sort of imagined nouvelle take on whatever they are serving.  The sweet tea is made with brown sugar.  BROWN SUGAR?  WHAT?  It's terrible.  The poboys are dressed with cole slaw.  Their okra is stewed (which is, to be fair, delicious), but whatever happened to a little cornmeal and cayenne and a deep fryer?  Their banana pudding is mostly a thick whipped mess that tastes a little like banana.  Their pecan pie is a pecan square that lacks the 1/2-inch cornsyrupy middle layer required by law every place south of the M-D.\n\nGod knows I love creativity in cuisine, but this is not the cuisine for it.

That is my main complaint. The mac and cheese tastes good but it is really watery and not thick like it should be. Overall I actually like this place but I think people who get burnt food should send it back, (like I didn't do because they are so nice), in order to teach them the difference between burnt food and barbecued and seasoned food.

The Beef Brisket was semi-good. I didn't finish it. Something about the sauce I didn't like. Everything had some type of spicyness to it. Cornbread had some jalapeno, beans had jalapenos and the greens were spicy. But it was that perfect spicyness, not overwhelming at all.\n\nThe service was great.

For whatever reason, this city is so fixated on non-meat or new age options that it forgets the value in the simple act of cooking a piece of dead animal over an flame.  Cavemen (and cavewomen) certainly hit on a good thing when they first started doing it with mammoth and such, why not continue with what works?\n\nPreviously, I had by recommended to try Memphis Minnie's, which I was told had good BBQ.  It doesn't.  It has awful BBQ.  The meat is dry, but not because it has been spice-rubbed and smoked for several hours at low heat.  It is dry because it was cooked over a gas for not too much time and barely basted in mediocre sauce.  It isn't 'northern/Kansas' style and it isn't 'southern/Memphis' style.  It is bad.\n\nBaby Blues is different.  While it would never be considered world class BBQ, it is the best BBQ I've ever had in California by a good margin.  The half slab I got was well seasoned and prepared. In the vein of Charlie Vergo's Rondezvous in Memphis, the ribs were somewhere between total dry rub and dripping is sauce.  They hung onto the bone, but had a nice tomato-based sauce that had been slow cooked on.  The bottled sauces were good and simple as well, mainly a thin BBQ sauce of the tomato and spices variety, and two hot sauces.\n\nService was a little slow, which would be the one downside, but the prices were fair.  My half slab was $11, a full slab is $21.  With two sides and corn bread you're looking at $18.  I'll definitely be going back, next time for pulled pork or maybe beef brisket.

Summers on Granny's porch helping her shuck corn from her garden or destring some beans were often cooled down with tall, sweaty glasses of iced tea sweetened with plenty of sugar. Little soothes the sweat of sweltering Southern summers like sweet, sweet tea.\n\nBaby Blues BBQ has sweet tea.

We'd ordered takeout from them a couple of times before, but this was our first dine-in experience. And it rocked.\n\nWe didn't have to wait long at all for a table, and the hostess was quick and competent. Our server was attentive, energetic and as friendly as a waitress out to be at a BBQ joint. San Francisco is a foodie town where far too often the servers slack off because the food carries so much weight. And it kinda sucks; they sometimes act like you are doing them a favor by chosing to dine there. This server was a gem, though. No pretense, prompt and most importantly of all, attentive. (I watched the owner walk an older male guest through his beer order when he ordered a Coors that they did not carry.) You can tell the staff here really wants to get it right, and it makes all the difference.\n\nThe food is a little pricey, but man, is it good. Stick with the ribs and pulled pork, and you won't go wrong. We split the three meat, two side combo with cornbread, and we were both stuffed to the gills. \n\nIt's a little noisy in here, but it's so great to see families, elderly couples, large groups, college dudes and couples all getting down on some country cooking.

Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.  There is nothing authenticly BBQ about this place.  That's not to say that the food's not good.  It can be, depending on what you order.  The best thing I've had is the shrimp po-boy, which is delicious.  The hamburger is also excellent -- they mix gorgonzola and bacon into the meet while pattying it, then grill it perfectly with a cruchy exterior and juicy interior.  The buns are particularly good.  \nThe sweet tea, made with brown sugar, is also a nice twist.  On these items alone, they earn 3 stars.  This is a good meal.\n\nBut that ain't real BBQ.  It takes more than frozen shrimp, hamburger, and sweet tea to call yourself an authentic BBQ joint.  That's especially true considering that the more traditional BBQ items I've tried havn't been all that good.  The pulled pork, chicken, and brisket were all dry and not very tasty.  They needed tons of the housemade XXX sauce (which was nice and spicy) to give them any flavor.  The collard greens were an odd grey/greenish color and were flavorless and watery.  And whoever calls this the best mac-and-cheese of their life is, well, clearly not from the South.  This mac-and-cheese was nasty and curdled and the elbow macaronis are way over-cooked and mushy.  I've tried it twice now to be sure, and I sent it back the second time it was so bad.  \n\nGo for the burger or the po-boy...and get some sweet tea...then walk over to Humphrey Slocumbe for some outrageous small batch ice cream!", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

It was a Monday so there weren't many others in the restaurant. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the baked beans, it was topped with a heap of pulled pork and full of flavor. Their BBQ sauce and beef brisket are quite satisfying, but I was incredibly disappointed with the collard greens and unimpressed by the mac n cheese and potato salad. The collard greens were cooked in some kind of salty tomato stew and was nothing like southern collard greens.

First of all to call it BBQ is not accurate since the meat is not actually BBQed.  Cooking the meat in the oven is not the same as BBQ.  The pulled pork had a good, tender, and juicy texture, but the flavor was rather bland since it wasn't smoked and therefore didn't have any smokey flavor.  The same goes for the ribs.\n\nOf the fixin's we had, the cole slaw and mac and cheese were really good. The collards tasted like sweet and sour cabbage. They were cooked in some kind of tomato-based sauce and left my North Carolina bred husband very confused and disappointed.  The baked beans were also a bit disappointing since they had like 5 different kind of beans including black beans, which do not belong in baked beans.  The flavor of the baked beans was good, but the competing texture of all of those beans didn't help.  I was not crazy about the cornbread and found it to be a bit overcooked. I like the whole corn kernels in there and the flavor was pretty good, but again it was overcooked.\n\nI had the peach betty for dessert and I liked it, but my husband thought it was too heavy on the nutmeg.  After, I wished I had tried the banana pudding.\n\nThis is one of the few places you can find sweet tea in the city, but frankly, it wasn't sweet enough.\n\nIf you have been to the south and know what BBQ tastes like down there, this place doesn't cut it.  With some of the other places in the city, I don't think we'll be going there again.", "author": "Nicole W."}

That's about where the positives end.\n\nWe walked in on a Wednesday around 9:00pm.  Still semi-crowded but not bad.  Plenty of open seating but they seemed to have a heck of a time trying to figure out where to put us.  \n\nFood:  I ordered a hamburger, well-done.  \"Just no pink inside,\" is what I say.  It arrives and there is a charcoal crust, nearly a quarter-inch deep on all surfaces.  I decide to be brave and take a bite.  It was like eating a brick from the walls of Hell.  I'm not one to complain or send back food--I'm too shy and embarassed.  But this?  I just couldn't do it.\n\nI call the waiter over, who takes the plate.  The manager comes back, with the plate in hand and says something to the effect of:  \"You ordered this well done.  If you want it cooked through, the fire is going to char it.  It's always going to be this way.\"  There I am, with my plate shoved in my face, hamburger sitting there with one bite taken out of it, and thinking to myself, \"I would be embarassed to serve this.\"  I simply tell her again that it is inedible but I would be happy to try something else from their menu.\n\nBeef brisket sandwich comes.  It's ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Which was the guys' impression of their chicken, pork, and ribs.  Mashed potatoes were way too chunky and came out cold--it was like eating potato salad.  The mac&cheese wasn't bad though.\n\nPricey.  Bill came out to $30/pp, with each guy only getting 1 beer and then my lemonade.  I think that's steep for BBQ, especially that far down on Mission Street.  Oh yea, and that $30/pp was after we had them re-total the check because they charged us for extra beers never ordered.\n\nSure, it may have been just that I was hungry coming in the door that they seemed slow.

I wouldn't say I am now convert, but I can say that I am happy to look the other way with Baby Blues' ribs. Meat falling off the bones and dry rub flavor shines through the char-broil. Standard barbeque sauce on the table was flavorful without overpowering (tomato-based with a hint of vinegar.)\n\nWide variety of well executed sides including mashed sweet potatoes, baked beans, mac and cheese and collard greens. The waiter mentioned something about the cole slaw having wasabi undertones, but I wish I didn't hear that. I would rather live my fantasy of the perfect, TRADITIONAL, barbeque outside of the likes of Memphis or the Carolinas. Mac and cheese seemed to have spices that added character as well, but it would have worked for me without the complexity.\n\nThey have both world-class beers on tap and distinctive but cost-effective wines by the glass. They had me at the German pils and Argentinean malbec. They even had Kool-Ade for the kids.\n\nDesserts including pecan pie and bread pudding looked great but I didn't  have room.\n\nSome purists would say that the atmosphere, menu etal. is too high brow for an authentic BBQ joint. I tend to agree, but the place is good at resetting expectations and having customers leave satisfied.\n\nThey might have a sign somewhere outside, but I didn't see it.

I am very happy that Baby Blues BBQ has opened up in my hood and it might become a staple for take out, along with Goood Frickin' Chicken and El Gran Taco Loco (my current favs from the hood). \n\nI was excited to see this place open up and take over a location that has had nothing to offer for many years. Baby Blues is a very friendly, welcoming and cool place -  good for take out or to dine in and have a draft beer. \n\nI opted for take out and decided to order a lot of food (just for myself) and get a good feel for the place. I think it's reasonably priced for BBQ and the 3 meals have stretched into 6, so it's pretty generous portions. \n\nThe Food:\n1) \"Memphis Queen\"- 1/2 BABY BACK RIBS, 1/2 MEMPHIS RIBS $24.95. Not my favorite BBQ ribs. The rub was good, but there was no smoky flavor at all. The meat was tender enough, but because it lacked any smokiness it seemed like they were just baked. I might not order the ribs again, and that's a big minus. Isn't BBQ supposed to be smoked? I liked the Memphis Ribs better than the Baby Back Ribs. \n\n2) Beer braised BEEF BRISKET plate $13.95. I've never had pulled brisket before. Not what I was expecting, but I actually liked it a lot. Again, the meat is not smoked. I liked the brisket better than the ribs, and in general this is not usually my preference.\n\n3) Marion County slow-smoked CHICKEN $14.95. Of all the meats, I liked the chicken the best. It had the most flavor and I would eat this on a semi-regular basis and it tasted the most of smoke. The portion was a half a chicken.\n\nThe Sides:\n1) Baked Beans: were watery and more like a cross between bean soup and baked beans. I would not order these again. I have the best recipe for baked beans and I might give it to them. These might have been vegetarian, but I'm not sure. Not a good side - a little too boring. \n\n2) Coleslaw: OK, nothing special. I would not order this side again, since they have some sides that are fantastic.\n\n3) Sauteed Okra: a grand slam. Not many places serve okra 'cause it's one of those challenging foods for people who didn't grow up with the stuff. I grew up eating okra (Southern parents) and I've never had it prepared like this before. Fucking awesome. It's sauteed with tomatoes and lots of vinegar. I loved this dish and hope they don't take it off the menu.\n\n4) Mashed Sweet Potatoes: my other favorite. Simple and yummy. Much better for you than regular mashed potatoes.\n\n5) Collard Greens: pretty good. I've never had collards done exactly like this, they weren't braised beyond recognition and had bacon and tomatoes in them. I would order this side again.\n\n6) Chicken Smoked Rice: good, but really tasted just like Zatarains brand boxed yellow rice. I like the stuff, but it didn't taste homemade. A little junk foody, but sometimes junk foody is good. \n\nThe BBQ Sauces: \n1) regular BBQ sauce: very vinegary. It's tangy and sweet and makes your mouth wake up. I usually like more molasses and a thicker consistency - I'm a big fan of the Big Nates' BBQ sauce. All and all, their sauce really grew on me - it has a lot of personality. \n\n2) Hot BBQ sauce: it's medium (not hot, just a little mouth burn) and also has a lot of personality. I feel the same way about it as I did their regular sauce - it grew on me too. \n\nNote: The corn bread is really yummy here. It's not traditional at all, but is almost like a cornmeal cake. It's got corn kernels and is very sticky. I loved it.\n\nSummary:\nBaby Blues BBQ gets a solid 3 stars from me. This place has it's own San Francisco Bernal Heights vibe and will do well. Next, I am looking forward to trying their BBQ seafood dishes.\n\nWishes:\nI wish Baby Blues would add 2 side dishes to their menu: lima beans and braised cabbage and also use my spicy chipotle baked beans recipe.", "author": "Yvette K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-17", "description": "Let me preface my thoughts by saying that I'm a real barbecue aficionado.  I have a mild obsession with good barbecue; in fact, I ordered the June 2008 issue of Texas Monthly (which ranks the best barbecue joints in Texas) and am going on a barbecue journey through rural Texas next month.  I realize Baby Blues bills itself as North Carolina barbecue, but I'm familiar enough with both styles to be able to write intelligently.\n\nThe problem with barbecue in San Francisco is that no restaurants are serious enough about the meat to use a pit smoker rather than one of those generic commercial smokers.  Notice that every well-regarded barbecue joint in the South pit smokes the barbecue.  Being a NC/TX barbecue snob when eating in CA isn't about putting on airs--there are real, tangible, substantive differences in the quality of the meat and the preparation.  Seeing the commercial smoker when I walked into Baby Blues was an immediate point against.\n\nNow to the food.  Baby Blues has its strengths and weaknesses.  I compare it most directly to Memphis Minnie's, which I believe to be the only decent barbecue restaurant in the city (Bo's in Lafayette is good but quite a drive).  I don't think Baby Blues compares favorably to Minnie's.  The brisket (braised--most serious barbecue restaurants serve it sliced) is absolutely drenched in sauce.  Good brisket doesn't need to be served in a soup of barbecue sauce.  Makes it impossible to taste the flavor of the meat, which is the entire brisket experience.  Minnie's brisket, while sometimes a little too dry (but generally excellent), earns a huge win when compared to Baby Blues.  \n\nMinnie's sausage also wins.  This may be my personal preference only--I like Czech sausage, not the links that Baby Blues serves.  \n\nBaby Blues may have a slight advantage on the ribs front.  The ribs (I tried both the Memphis style and the baby backs) are pretty good--juicy, though in smaller sizes and portions than Minnie's.  \n\nThe sides at Baby Blues are good.  Good cornbread and good creamed spinach.  The mac n cheese is identical to Minnie's, which makes me think they just use the same distributor.  \n\nThe service was also good.  This is sometimes a complaint of mine at Minnie's--they can be rude and dismissive, especially when busy.  At Baby Blues, the waiter and his young son (I think it was his son) were both very nice and asked what dishes I liked and didn't like--good form for a new business.\n\nIn the end, because quality of meat and preparation trump all other factors, Memphis Minnie's retains its spot on top.  Baby Blues isn't that far behind, though--and if you like ribs, I recommend it.", "author": "Damien W."}

So you would think there would be some element of smoke to the food. Alas not; the only element of smoke was the burnt smell from the two inept, lets say chefs in the loosest terms, incinerating everything in their path. Just like the \"Dragon\" in Dr. No.  They would have been better served using a flamethrower.  BBQ invokes the image of slow cooked, spicy, yet sweet food that melts in the mouth.  I have too many complaints, so lets list them for brevity.\n\n1. XXX sauce (their signature) = over vinegary, habanera liquid served in a squeeze bottle with masking tape as a label.  Tasted just like Frank's RedHot original \n2. Sausage = $3.50 for an incinerated 5\" offering that tasted like any generic sausage.\n3. Ribs= to bad to mention, although tender, no seasoning, no spice, NO NOTHING.  Oh did I mention, more over cooked than Joan of Arc.\n4. Beans = Blandy, Bland \n5. Mac and Cheese the only redeeming dish of the trip\n6. Pulled pork = mediocre, they separated into  myofibrils, which is good, but again no flavor\n7. Spinach = Good\n\nI really wanted it to be great. I really wanted to support a local business, but I can't condone duping the public with crap, just like those infomercials.\n\nSo San Francisco you still lack a truly outstanding BQQ establishment.

The brisket and pulled pork are braised in Guinness, so it's tender, moist and has some depth -- but it has none of the smoky flavor that you would expect from BBQ.  I'm not sure how they do their ribs, but I imagine it's some sort of grill/oven combination.  Again, not BBQ.

On average the food is always really good, though sometimes the tendency is to overcook some things (shrimp, chicken breast).  \n\nUp until today I considered Baby Blues a pretty benign, non threat to my decency and pants size, because you had to make the choice to go there, and because I pass it pretty often while I'm jogging, and that puts it all in check because I'm able to feel at that very moment how hard it is to say good bye to juicy, tangy, fatty BBQ.  But, today for lunch we had the pulled pork (boyfriends) and chicken (mine) sandwiches and collard greens, and they were DELIVERED TO US!

The thing is, they boast Po'boys on the menu. I don't think they got 'em, as I've tried them, and I've been a bit disappointed. Actually they're nothing like po'boys in my opinion; I'm from New Orleans. But this is a BBQ place, as their name suggests and I've heard the pulled pork is pretty darn good. Maybe I need to quit pretending that this place is going to bring me home for an hour or two and just go for beers and sides. The sweet tea was too sweet for me. I wish they had more fried things on the menu... like fries.

We ordered FAR too much food. \n\nWhen I called up, the woman who took my call was helpful and the food was ready when she said it would be. When I went in to pick up the food, I noticed that the decor was lacking and pretty minimal. The place has a bar but it is quite bland and devoid of decoration. And, the place was fairly filled with smoke from the open kitchen. \n\nWe ordered the pulled pork plate and the Three Kings (ribs, brisket and 1/4 chicken (thigh & leg)). The pork was really good. Very juicy and tender. The ribs were great albeit a bit charred but really tasty and quality meat. The brisket was fair. It was pulled and I prefer it sliced. I did not try the chicken as I try to stay clear of dark meat chicken. \n\nEach plate came with two sides. They sides are mongo! I know some people have complained that their prices are fairly high here. But, these sides are like meals in themselves. You'll definitely have leftovers. So, think of it as two meals in one. My friend liked his Mac & cheese and his pork and beans were great. Totally a meal unto itself. I had the mashed sweet potatoes. Quite thick and tasty. The container must've weighed at least 1/3 lb. I also had the smoked rice which had good flavor but was a little dry. Each plate also comes with a nice sized piece of tasty corny corn bread. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad I tried it and I'll try it again to see if this place is really a three or a four.", "author": "Jeff P."}

I read about Baby Blues in Zagat's New and Notable list prior to reading some of the reviews here on yelp.  \n\nMy first impression was that this place was LOUD and BOISTEROUS.  I think it is the perfect atmosphere for folks looking for laughs, drinks, casual dining or a neighborhood ambiance.\n\nThe downside is that it is a bit chaotic.  We didn't know if we were required to seat ourselves or find a hostess to seat us.  It wasn't really clear.  For those who go there for the first time, I suggest going straight to the back to find a waitress.  Any waitress will be able to seat you.\n\nThe service was alright. The waitresses were friendly and although they were busy, they tried to ensure that we were okay on food and drinks.\n\nThe boyfriend and I ordered 2 Pulled Pork platters.  I knew that this was a risk for disappointment since I'm an Eastern NC raised girl.  Perhaps, I should have gone with the Memphis Queen platter, as other reviewers enjoyed it.  I really wasn't impressed with the pork.  There was not much flavor or spice to it, like NC pulled pork bbq.  In fact, the sauce that was suggested to us for use really didn't have the tang that I'm accustomed to using with pork bbq.  The sides were adequately portioned, but I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of corn bread.  The mac and cheese was alright, the chicken smoked rice was dry and bland.  Free refills on soda and sweet iced tea (I ordered a coke, so I can't comment on the sweet tea).  $34.60 w/tax, not included tip.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad that there are choices of places to go for Southern bbq in SF, but I don't know if this would be my first choice.  I just didn't find the pulled pork to my liking.  To each his own, but for the food, I'd rather go to another joint in the city.\n\nParking can be hit or miss in the area.", "author": "Hiromi N."}

Let's talk about what they do right. The ribs are awesome. Good flavoring but you definitely need to sauce it. The hot link is legit as is the chicken (It's really hard to mess up chicken on the bone)\n\nThe pulled pork only ok. Needs some more flavoring.   Brisket should always be sliced, so you can see the smoke rings but this is more jumbled. \n\nThe cornbread is more of a corn pudding and there's a funky flavor to it that I can't quite point out. I like my corn break light, fluffy and a bit sweet (while adding butter and honey). \n\nNow Sauces... tied for the most important part of BBQ. I really like the molasses sweet sauce. this goes great with just about everything. The other sauces, however, seems to not go with much. I must point out that two of them have Tobasco and I'm not a fan of Tabasco flavor in BBQ. \n\nFor sides, the potato salad is legit, the corn on the cob is awesome.

We came here based on her friend's recommendation who said they had the best BBQ ribs.  I'm not a fan of baby back ribs but I am a fan of trying new things so I thought, why not.\n\nOf course, when we got here, I didn't try the baby back ribs.  Instead, I went for their pulled pork, even though I don't eat pork much.  The pulled pork plate came with two sides and cornbread.  For my sides, I ordered the Chicken Steamed Rice and Mac-n-Cheese.\n\nWhen my dish came, I dove into the mac.  I thought I had found the best mac-n-cheese until I came here.  Although that side is really heavy, it is also heavily delicious.  It's really cheesy - I think there might be several different types of cheeses in it.  The pulled pork was not bad but I couldn't get my fork out of my mac so I pretty much got full off of that.  When I did decide to take a break and try the pulled pork, I first drenched it in their Tabasco Ginger sauce.  Who ever thought of putting ginger in Tabasco?  But hey!  It works!  The other sauce I really liked was the XXX BBQ sauce which was surprisingly spicy.  But it's not hot.  So for you hot chile eaters, this may be just medium or mild for you.  I was really excited for their cornbread for some reason but when I bit into it, it turned out to not be that exciting.  So I stuck to my mac.  :)\n\nService there was great.  We got seated quickly, we got our food quickly, and our server was really friendly.  He even was so nice to get me a slice of butter for my cornbread.\n\nThe prices there are not awful but still kind of high.  It was $14 for my plate.  But I got leftovers so I can't complain.  Much.

So I wanted to season with a bit of salt & pepper, so we asked and not only did they \"NOT ALLOW SEASONING\" the waiter wasn't very friendly either. He was more like \"OH, THE CHEF DON'T ALLOW ANY EXTRA SEASONING LIKE SALT AND PEPPER ON THE SIDE; ITS MADE THE WAY ITS MADE AS IS\". So that was a downfall to the restaurant, since the food wasn't flavorful enough and when we ask for some seasoning (because it wasn't placed on the table already) they denied us.

So, if I give a California joint anything over 2 stars...I'd say it's pretty good. \nTheir \"Memphis-style\" ribs are not Memphis style in seasoning, but they are good. There is a clove/cinnamon factor and not enough smoke to be Memphis style. They are also finished with a sweet molasses wet sauce which would NEVER happen in Memphis. However, I won't give them a strike for flavor. They may \"hide\" a bit behind sauce, but the sauces are good and the collard greens, while too large in size to actually eat without a huge mess, are very authentic in flavor and I enjoyed them a great deal. The cornbread is very rich and tasty - again...not southern style at all (we don't do sweet cornbread), but almost like a sweet dessert addition to the plate. \nI didn't try the pulled pork or any other meats like their brisket, but my ribs were flavorful and good. \nI say, ignore the descriptions and the references to parts of the country where the styles of each meat's treatment originate because they're mostly wrong. Just go to eat a nice piece of barbecue and you'll be happy. Specials, desserts that looked appetizing and many beers on tap round out the 3-star review.", "author": "Melody M."}

The place feels thrown-together, half-finished, bad feng shui all over the place, bad lighting . . . it really affects the experience.\n\nWe avoided the ribs due to the very mixed reviews of them here - got the pulled pork which was TASTELESS, didn't taste like smoke, or BBQ sauce, or anything - they basically didn't season it at all.  However, the beef brisket was quite good, and somewhat redeemed the blah pork experience.  The sides were generally good - great mashed sweet potatoes, great collards, and decent corn and okra.  Decent cornbread, a little too dense for our tastes.  Oh the other thing - of everything that was served, only the sweet potatoes were hot.

Disappointed at first by the notion of only three ribs constituting a third of a rack I rescinded my previous thoughts about halfway through the second that was already filling my moderate meat quota of the day.\n\nLicking my fingers off of my left hand first seemed a smart-witted way of reaching quicker toward the three remaining presents that awaited me, all wrapped in a clear plastic tupperware that both shared surprises, yet gave no indication of what final enjoyment could be made of them. The mashed potatoes first... no gravy... perhaps they would have given me some if I had included it in special instructions but silly me for assuming such. Mac n' cheese is up, opened and forked. It's separated a little, testament to it's main ingredient, CHEESE! I've had better but I wouldn't have had enough space in my mouth to complain to imaginary friends that may have been sitting around me.\n\nThe final tub brings me back into meat heaven with a heaping stack of pulled pork that makes me contemplate the purpose in those many years of my life that I shunned pork in some of it's most delicious forms. I may have been set back a little in my side choices but what they do right they do damn right. As I top it off with bites off my cornbread I realize that they saved the best for a surprising end as this moist corny goodness bursts with the buttery flavor that strangely makes me think of a french recipe that they're somehow passing off  as a sauce despite the ingredients include butter and water, that is steamed away.", "author": "Jaron W."}

The sides actually outshine the meat selections. The ribs are burnt, the chicken rather dry with too much sauce, but the grilled tiger shrimp is screaming good.

So we ordered the one appetizer (Suicide Kings) and the Mason Dixon plate (1/2 rack Memphis Ribs; BBQ chicken breast, 2 sides, cornbread). I'm not sure if they really expect one person to eat that much food.\n\nThe appetizer was strange. It was corn bread topped with pulled pork, something creamy and served with cole slaw. It tasted good when you ate the components separately, but together it was a mish-mash. It was also a lot of food. I would guess it was a 1200 calorie dish. It also arrived at the same time as the entree, defeating the purpose of ordering an appetizer.\n\nThe entree however fell short. First, the choices for side dishes (Fixins) are all starches or fats with the exception of the collard greens and the stewed tomatoes. My man hates stewed tomatoes, so we ordered the collard greens and the mashed sweet potato. The collard greens were cooked in a stewed tomato sauce. (Sorry Muffin.) I thought the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like baby food, my boyfriend thought they tasted more like lamb food.\n\nThe biggest problem however was the meat. I'm a chicken breast connoisseur, and my chicken breast was completely dried out. Boston Market cooks moister, more flavorful chicken. Portion-wise, it was a ginormous chicken breast, but I had to soak it in sauce to give it any flavor. My boyfriends ribs were also problematic. First, Baby Blues has itsy-bitsy tables that are covered in condiments before you sit down, then the food is served on plastic plates, and their utensils are dollar-store quality. As he tried to cut his ribs apart, the plate kept sliding around on the table until I finally held it in place and then his fork bent backward from the pressure of his index finger. Fortunately it was easy to bend back. (Perfect for Uri Geller)\n\nThey get points for what I assume are recycled chairs, but lose points for the sharp edges underneath that scratched up our fingers. On the other hand, the service was friendly and attentive without interrupting our conversation. We really wanted to like this place, but it fell short in too many ways.", "author": "Ana D."}

So 5 of us share 4 plates and it was enough. \n\nTheir food are generally greasy, I know I know... what do you expect at a BBQ place, but it is more so than any other place I been to. Flavor, now that is problem, it is bland, I mean it is salty enough, but just doesn't have that finger licking spice flavor. \n\nBeef rib come in one giant piece, it does have considerable amount of meat on it, it is not bad.\n\nPull pork is just okay, bland.\n\nRib is okay, not bad, but you should just close your door if you can even make that right.\n\nCat fish is small and bland.\n\nNow, comes to the sides, the corn bread is average, it is not as terrible as some might say here; collar greens, not cooked enough; mashed potato, good; roasted tomato; good, mac & cheese, average; smoke chicken rice, good. \n\nBottom line, unless I am in the neighborhood and craving BBQ, I won't be back.

I've been there 3 times in the last month, that's how good it is.\n\nThe menu is extensive with a variety of meat choices and side dishes.  The Memphis ribs were outstanding - smoky, meaty, just the right right amount of sweetness  The Carolina is good too which is a bit sweeter and less smoky.  Pull pork & brisket are also out of this world.\n\nSide dishes are good here too.  Corn bread is rustic with pieces of corn embedded.  I'm not too crazy about the way Collard Greens were prepared.  It's a bit bitter and sour.  I love Collard G, but I think this is a bit overcooked for my taste (could just be a southern thing).  The beans were really tasty and so is the Fresh Banana Pudding, which is incredibly fresh and home made tasting.  It's highly recommended, so save room for dessert.\n\nThe place is pretty basic so don't expect anything fancy.  It's a great place to bring kids as it's very casual.  The building is interesting as it's in an old drug store.  Parking is fairly easy on the street (meter parking).\n\nLunch is a couple of bucks cheaper, but you only get one side.  Sandwiches are also available if you're not a big eater, which is a good way to try out their meat before committing to a large, more expensive entree.\n\nService is really friendly.  I think it's probably family-run as they really seem to care about their customer.  They're patient, helpful and cheerful.  They're the friendliest bunch of servers I've seen in a long time. \n\nThis is my favorite BBQ in the city, so I will be heading back there soon.", "author": "Paul K."}

I ate food that someone else picked up from here, so I have no comments about the ambiance, etc. We had memphis ribs and baby back ribs, both of which were the highlights of the meal. They were not as tender as they could have been and were on the dry-ish side but were really tasty and everyone liked them. The cornbread was good - maybe overly sweet for some but I liked it. I was sort of surprised at how many things weren't bad but weren't great either - the bbq chicken was fine but nothing special. I would eat it again but wouldn't pick it out. The pulled pork was cooked well, I thought, but really lacked in flavor. I poured bbq sauce over it and then it was good (also, I liked the bbq sauce but others thought it was too sweet) - but again, I would order something else next time. We got sides of the baked beans and smoked chicken rice. The beans were fine - there was a nice variety of types of beans, although I didn't find them very flavorful. The rice may have been the biggest disappointment. It was fine as rice but almost as innocuous as white rice. So, I wouldn't recommend that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a 4 star place if you feel like going out for some tasty meat, but probably more like 3 stars if you're looking for real bbq. So, I would eat here again sometime, but it definitely isn't the answer to my quest for BBQ in the Bay Area, which I think will take a turn towards the East Bay, as it probably should have long ago.\n\nPS - Also, if you do get take out, make sure to double check the contents of your order.

Brisket was \"pulled\" or shredded like the pork, the ribs were bland and not very tender.  The quarter section of the chicken was cooked just right but the breast meat was dry and crumbly.  Overall, very bland meat, but that's because it was not barbecued, i.e. slowly cooked by heat and smoke.  The sauces weren't bad and they are in squeeze bottles on every table.\n\nPotato salad tasted like boiled potatoes.  The baked beans were creative with not just pinto beans but black and kidney as well.  Mac n cheese was good but my friends make better.  Cornbread was not that appealing and overly oiled.\n\nThe one redeeming quality of this place is the banana pudding.

I'm very particular about my ribs. I like them to fall off the bone. These were far from that. They could also have used some more flavor. The coleslaw I got as my side could have used something... I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps a little onion, or a dab of horseradish, just something to give it a little oomph. \n\nDid I mention the steep prices?\n\nSo, all in all, Baby Blues missed the mark.", "author": "Liz R."}

Baby Blues BBQ is shiny and new on the one hand, full of excitement and anticipation when you enter, but on the other, it has kinks that need to be worked out still. There's a big common table, a counter, and a bunch of tables. Great for families and larger groups (if you don't mind the wait). The decor was a bit spartan, with a few art pieces over freshly painted walls. The staff was top-notch (very friendly, helpful, and working as fast as they can), though with the big crowd, it was noticeable that they haven't gotten into a rhythm yet. That being said, they are off to an impressive start, and I expect as things settle in, the place will only get better.\n\nI had the baby back ribs, beef brisket, and blackened catfish. Sides included okra and mac and cheese. The highlight was the ribs. If you go, just get the ribs. The catfish didn't taste that fresh, and was a bit over-blackened, but again the ribs were great (did I mention the ribs?). The sides, were decent as well. Okra was cooked the right way (non-slimy), a bit on the over-salted-side, but the roasted tomato helped offset that. The mac and cheese wasn't that goopy stuff that some other restaurants have, but it was nicely baked. For dessert, we had the banana pudding. Now, that doesn't sound like the most fascinating of desserts, but it was damn good. Corn bread was superb as well.\n\nGood beer and wine selection, as well as beverages such as sweet tea. If you enjoy spicy foods, ask for the XXX BBQ sauce (if it isn't at your table already). It's the bomb.\n\nIf I were to judge purely on food, decor, and price, I'd give 3 stars, but given that the ribs were great, that they put their heart into things, and that they've just opened, I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. \n\nI look forward to coming back, and trying out their other offerings. They certainly have the right idea, and with persistence, I'm hoping that I've witnessed the beginnings of a new San Francisco institution.", "author": "Boris C."}

The service was very slow even though the restaurant was only about 25% full. We finally did get our order and took it home to find that one of orders was missing cornbread. Disappointing because the cornbread is tasty! The rest of the food was good but darn, we missed that cornbread!\n\nSecond time we ordered delivery.  My boyfriend clearly gave our phone number, address and credit card number. The clerk said the food would arrive in 45 minutes. Almost 90 minutes later and no food. We never got a phone call or a doorbell ring.  No food!\n\nSo the boyfriend called Baby Blues and asked about our order. The clerk told him, \"Oh, the driver went to your address and called your number but nobody picked up. The delivery guy came back with the food.\" The boyfriend says, \"We have a doorbell and it was never rung.\" The clerk reads back our phone number - it is off by 1 digit. He cannot explain why the delivery clerk never rang the doorbell though.\n\nThe clerk offers to have the cooks refire the food for another delivery, but we don't want to eat an hour later, we wanted to eat at the latest 30 minutes earlier.\n\nSo the boyfriend tells the clerk, please cancel the order and cancel the charges on the credit card. I call back to confirm that the credit card charge will be canceled and the clerk says, \"Yeah, I'm just about to do that.\"\n\nWell, now it is FIVE days later and still no credit on the charge card. The boyfriend calls Baby Blues and they say, \"It's going to take another day to figure out.\"\n\nFunny how the clerk got the credit card number correct and not the phone number... sigh.\n\nConclusion: The food may be adequate, but the service is awful.

The corn was delicious with the cheese powder, but I have had it served this way at a few other restaurants around town. The pork was perfectly tender and wonderful. The highlight was, surprisingly, the okra. It was cooked to perfection, with stewed tomatoes, and a touch of garlic. My date was scared of okra, but I talked him into trying it, and he ended up eating most of it.\nThe corn bread was crumbly with bits of corn, different than many other places, but tasted more natural. No sweet butter or honey to go with it if that's your thing. \nWe tried all the sauces. The tangy tabasco was my favorite. The sauce that was supposed to be very hot, wasn't to my palate, and it tasted a little bland. Then there was a sauce that was a little sweeter, also a little bland.

Usually I prefer to visit a place several times to draw conclusions, but hey here I am at the laptop with nothin to do...\n\nOur first visit had mixed results.  Our party gave high praise to the 'fixins', which is what they call their $3.75 ea. sides, while the guys working the grill were obviously novices having burned two of four plates of ribs.\n\nTwo weeks later we found  what was probably their franchise broiler cook schooling the fellas on the grill. Both Memphis style pork ribs and baby backs came to us perfecto. They provide two types of bbq sauce at the table in squeeze bottles, regular and XXX. We all gave them good marks. \n\nNot being from the south or anything close to being a bbq officionado, just a boy with an appetite, I was well pleased with the ribs.\n\nOur second visit found changes in the fixins, some good some bad. The potato salad which I absolutely adored, had gone south. My first bite was raw onion, bitter, sharp, unpleasant. Lots of skins in there  as well from the red potatoes. I remembered the sweetness of the first visit. The onion definitely overpowered the flavor profile.\n\nThe cornbread was different this time too. It was not as dense as our first visit, which I happened to like. The mac 'n cheese was different, this time very wet, the flavor needed some punch. Our first visit it really popped with a nice crust on the top which was missing.\n\nPurist will not like the collard greens in a tomato sauce, but I loved it! Great flavor. Sweet Potato salad was excellent as well. I didn't reorder baked beans this time, however on the first visit I thought they didn't resemble anything like baked beans I had ever come across, which in and of its self is okay, however flavor was lacking in my opinion.\n\nDon't miss desserts! Especially if you love banana pudding like I do! I savored every bite! The pecan pie was very tasty as well.\n\nI was very happy to see Trumer ale on tap, which they serve in these cool, slender glasses, as well as Guiness. Guiness and BBQ...I like it!\n\nOverall our party was very satisfied with our meals. The kitchen will work out the kinks I do believe and this place will continue to improve. Just please rinse those onions fellas before you put them in the potato salad!\n\nI would be remise if I didn't mention the very good servers we have had. Very friendly and accomodating...all family members of the owner. We will definitely be going back when it's time for bbq.", "author": "Don H."}

I'm impressed.  \n\nMy ribs were quite good, but the real highlight wasn't the meat; it was the sauces and the sides.  There were four available sauces; all good and all quite differently styled.  I'm sure there's something there for everyone (me, I would be very happy with three of them and perfectly OK with the fourth were it the only one there.)  The sides were also great.

So instead, the guy who showed up with the order turned out to be the OWNER who hired a taxi to make deliveries.

There was no sign of the meat being pink (which occurs as the meat absorbs smoke during the que'ing process).  Also the sauce on the outside was chared.

Baby Blues doesn't really have Carolina Q, and you can tell they are still getting up on their feet over there, but this is a quick summary of my first impressions: \n\nFood = 3 stars. The pulled pork was super tender and juicy and a generous portion, but no real seasoning that I could taste, just straight up pork. There was a good sauce on the table, but I'm still in search of the vinegar-based sauce; I think it would be a great addition to this dish. The slaw was just right, not too mayo-y. They were out of mashed sweet potato, so i tried the mac and cheese- no slouch! Frankly, I don't expect gourmet mac and cheese from a BBQ joint (go to Blue Plate for that), this was just fine. The cornbread needs work - I recommend go simple and traditional, stick to salty and light (this slice was neither). My beau's side of mashed potatoes was quite good, and the okra was fabulous. I mean it - really, really good okra. Finished with banana pudding - really mostly whipped creamy, very few bananas. I'd beef up the banana next time around. and the nilla wafers. \n\nAtmosphere = 3 stars. Good music, good lighting. I like the open kitchen/grill area and the large wooden tables (are any family-style seating?) I think Baby Blues could probably go even more simple with the presentation - I don't need a candle on the table of my BBQ joint, and it's not that dark in there anyway. I do, however, need room on the small tables for all that food! \n\nService = 4 stars. Baby Blues is still trying to figure out how to balance in-house orders with large delivery and take out orders, so we experienced a long (long) delay getting our food, similar to what some others have written about. But you know what? They recognized the problem, acknowledged it honestly, brought us our sides ahead of time upon request, and also gave us complimentary drinks and a dessert to thank us for our patience. More than one waitress came to apologize and see that we had what we needed. Very cool. \n\nWe will definitely be back to check it out again in a few weeks after things have settled down and the service and kitchen get some more practice on their routine.", "author": "Melissa M."}

I'm sorry but I was sorely disappointed. I had read reviews by my fellow Yelpers and my gut told me to go there with caution. \n\nMy coworkers and I each ordered a glass of wine as a treat after a long arduous week at work. One coworker got an extra treat when a fly landed in her wine. We had to flag down the waiter since he was too busy playing a board game at the bar to notice us. At least he gave her a full replacement glass of wine. I ordered the \"Three Kings\" platter hoping a sampling of 3 types of meat - the Memphis ribs, beef brisket, and chicken - would show me how good their BBQ was and have enough to bring home to my husband. Fortunately the chicken was juicy and tasty and the beef brisket was moist but needed sauce for some flavor. My biggest disappointment was the Memphis ribs. I know Memphis BBQ uses a dry rub, but that doesn't mean the BBQ is dry too! Not only was there little to no meat on my rib bones but the meat was as dry as a bone. It was completely inedible. One of my sides, the creamed spinach, was bland. The saving grace of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were tasty. \n\nWe also ordered banana pudding to round out the meal. Another big disappointment. I don't know why they called it \"pudding\" since it was merely a bowl of very thick and somewhat tasteless whipped cream with a few slices of banana. I tasted no pudding whatsoever. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the meal was how much I had to shell over for a mediocre/bad meal. I'm sorry but the meal wasn't worth the $44 I paid.

I got there about 3ish ,but they were still setting up for business at 5. \nFirst of, the guys who own and run the place are F-ing great. They prepare some ribs and shrimp for me before they were ready to open. While I was waiting, they offered me a beer and great convo about the place and their backgrounds.\nI was very impressed with the guys and what they want to do with the business. \n\nSo when I got my food home, OMG!! The ribs were great, and the rice was awesome as well. \nAlot of the food on the menu was not ready yet , b/c of my early arrival, but I'm going back next weekend and I plan on trying everything I can. \n\nPlease If you want good BBQ in San Francisco, GO TO BABY BLUES BBQ!

This time, however, it was just so so. \nAfter we were told that they no longer deliver to our area (we drove there in 10 min during rush hour) we sat down to what we thought would be delicious BBQ.  Sadly, it was not really worth the drive.  The ribs were dry, the corn bread  was greasy and tasted like vinegar, and the \"baked beans\" were a mixed kidney and white bean side dish that did not taste anything like what I have always called baked beans. The sides would have not have been such a big deal if the ribs had been scrumptious but they were not. I am not sure if there has been a switch in management but something has changed. \nI am sad to write this since we loved it the 1st time we ordered from here and were really looking forward to a saucy BBQ dinner!

So with that said, I start with 0 stars and they get earned from there.\nService: though it took the server a few minutes to come over to us, he promptly took our beer orders, got them too us quick and answered many questions about the menu. and got us more beers fast. worth a star.\nEntrees: We had tiger prawns, memphis ribs, baby back ribs and beef brisket. The prawns were great, worth a star alone. the brisket was shredded, very moist. good taste, I can give it a star. And then there is the ribs. Both were very dry and burnt! and neither was anything near fall off the bone. I'm sorry, but you don't open a BBQ place where the ribs don't fall off the bone. Minus 3 stars, 2 for the ribs sucking and 1 for the lack of effort. Brings them back to 0 stars total.\nSides: we had the mac and cheese, okra, collards greens, corn bread and pork and beans. the mac and cheese was ok, nothing to write home about. the beans weren't thick enough to be baked beans, but the inclusion of pulled pork was a good touch. the okra was ok, and the collard greens were quite tasty. the corn bread had the texture of corn bread, but lacked the corn somehow. I give them 1 star for the sides. \nSo for 1 star, I got the worst ribs i've ever had at a BBQ joint, good prawns, decent brisket and passable sides. and it all cost way too much, over $20 per platter.

I was on a real tight budget that night so I only ordered a 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and coleslaw  that I split with my wife, plus I wasn't very hungry to begin with.  The BBribs where just a little over cooked but still very good, I will order thoose again.  The coleslaw was terrible, like it was only half made and missing something.\n\nThe next time I went (this time for lunch) I had the Memphis style ribs, creamed spinich and more coleslaw.  The ribs where most excelent, had plenty of meat on them and were very tasty, the creamed spinich was different from any creamed spinich I have ever had before, but it was very good and left me wanting more.  The coleslaw was way better this time and I will order that again next time I go there, which will be soon as I work close by sometimes.\n\nAs for the decore of this new establishment, the small tables are a little bit to small and the place could use some better bar stools.

I was also happy to see they deliver.\nWe went on a Friday night and were told the wait would be an hour. I thought that was quite strange - as I have been in literally hundreds of BBQ joints all over the country and never had to wait. Stand in line, maybe, but not actually wait. I mean, the meat is already cooked, right? It's not as if the waitperson has to send an order to the kitchen to cook. The only BBQ places I've been to that had wait people maybe had them to refill your iced tea or - on rare occasions - to take your order and bring it to the table. But the whole point of BBQ is that it starts smoking early in the morning and is all ready when the place opens - so waiting an hour was quite confusing. Oh well, we had movie tickets, so we left and thought we would try it again soon. So Sunday we were having friends over and we thought we would try the delivery. \nThe food arrived and they had forgotten a few items. No biggie - new places always have kinks to work out. We called them and the super nice staff was very apologetic and promptly re-delivered the missing items. We had ordered the Baby Backs, brisket, and pulled pork with sides of beans, cole slaw, and mac and cheese. I was a bit leery because the meat didn't *smell* like BBQ. There was no spicy and smoky aroma. Yet I held out hope - thinking all that really mattered was the taste. This is where the trouble is - there is no taste. The meat is obviously cooked in an oven - not smoked. Thus it is NOT BBQ under any reasonable definition.\nWhat a bummer. I thought with their \"down-home\" branding and image they would at least raise to the lowest common BBQ denominator of selling smoked meat. I know we're in San Francisco and most people here have never had real BBQ - but still! Yes, I was previously suspicious when I've passed by and saw no woodpile, no smokers, no smoke - nothing to indicate it was a BBQ joint - but I assumed they must smoke off-site somewhere and bring the meat in. WRONG. They cook it in ovens and finish the ribs on a gas grill.\nSince it's not BBQ, not in cooking method or flavor - it's a bit pointless to review the meat. I will say the brisket by-the-pound was shredded - which as a BBQ aficionado - I've never had except in a sandwich. The pulled pork was lean and really flavorless. I mean, you do need some fat and you need it to be partly rendered out by slow smoking. That is just what BBQ is by definition. The ribs were OK - but I can make better oven-cooked ribs at home, if that's what I'm looking for.\nThe sides were very lackluster - the beans were a bland mixture of black beans, pinto beans, and a few others without the smoky-sweet-spicy taste of traditional BBQ beans. The mac and cheese just tasted of torn noodles and fat - not much cheese flavor and the advertised blue cheese was nowhere to be seen (or tasted.) The slaw was edible. The BBQ sauce was quite sweet and just lacked any soul or personality (which, I guess, is a perfect match to the meat.)\nThey have a very hip space, a really nice staff, and very reasonable prices for The City - but I just can't overlook the glaring fact that they're not selling BBQ. Thus the single star. One would think they might have visited Memphis, or Texas, or North Carolina to get a basic idea of what BBQ is before opening the place. Or at least stop in Lilly's on Divisadero (in my opinion still the best BBQ in San Francisco - though not top-notch.) Even Memphis Minnie's, which is sort of nuevo, lame, overpriced BBQ is much, much, much better.\nUnless they start smoking meat, I give them 6 months. Maybe I'm wrong and the hipster vibe, location, and basic lack of BBQ knowledge in San Francisco will somehow pull them through - but I doubt it.", "author": "David C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-16", "description": "This is a review written by someone who has been in the restaurant business for over 30 years, so please, bear with me here. Opening a new business is incredibly difficult, especially a restaurant. I know, I've helped open more than 8, including the Slanted Door, twice (Brannan and Ferry Building). It used to be that when a restaurant opened, they would have MONTHS before word got around about the new kid on the block, literally months. They'd have time to work out the kinks; service, ordering systems, how much food to order, etc... By the time word began to spread, they'd have had time to get their sh*t together and would be ready for their \"hope full\" success. Those days are long gone, thanks to the web, food blogs, yelp, eater-sf and the like. Folks are at your door minutes after you open, not months. The grace period to work out your kinks is GONE. And the whiny children and their whiny reviews on Yelp are all the proof you need that it's true. An additional problem with all these supposed-pundits and their ilk, is that now the mainstream press; Chronicle, SF Gate, Guardian, etc, now feel pressured to review new openings much sooner than the previous 3 month wait they used to observe. The upshot? Great new places that earn well deserved praise for their food can get crushed by the instant popularity and experience their growing pains in the space of days rather than months. \nMy advice, ignore the spoiled children who didn't get their food immediately. Yes, the ones not mature enough to look around and see that the place was overwhelmed and that maybe they should give the place a break and come back some other time? I'd bet anything that they're never opened anything more than a menu, let alone a real business. I'd love to know what they have contributed to their neighborhoods, besides childish bile...\n\nP.S.

Tonight, my boyfriend and I had to each go up in alternating turns to get every aspect of service needed.  First, they didn't refill our water. Then my boyfriend had to go up to request a beer even though they dropped the beer menu 15 minutes earlier. Then we had to ask for silverware.  I asked for a drink menu and never got one. Had to go up for one myself.  Then I had to go up and order a drink, of which never came.  It was one waitress and one dark haired guy who seemed to just stand there. Finally we were done with the meal and spent another 15 minutes staring him down for the check.  Finally, I went up and physically asked him for it, after which he said \"sure\"  and never sent it to us.  We were literally about to go up again when the blonde finally came over with it.

Its so close to my house and, growing up near one of the barbecue capitals of America, I am a huge fan of the stuff. However, I was sorely disappointed. \n\nI won't rate them on the service/atmosphere - which were not good - because they just opened. Those things will work themselves out, I'm sure. \n\nI will, however, rate them on the food - which was also not good. I ordered the combination plate - 3 meats, 2 sides and cornbread. I tried to order a sweetened tea and was told they didn't have tea yet ( no tea? I'm pretty sure that's just tea bags, sugar and water requiring no high tech piece of equipment), so water it was. \n\nNow, there are lots of different styles of barbecue - Texas, Kentucky, Memphis, The Carolinas etc. The one thing they all have in common is that rich, smokey, slow-cooked flavor. That flavor was nowhere to be found in the three meats I sampled. The best of the three where the baby back ribs, which were tender but mostly flavorless. My guess is they were mostly boiled and then seared (possibly lightly smoked) but had no barbecue flavor. The pulled pork was completely tasteless (where is that beautiful, almost burnt, caramelized skin you should see on any well barbecued meat?)and the brisket (which was pulled) tasted like it had been sitting in water to keep it moist. It was by far the worst of the three. Every good BBQ cook knows that if you have to slather it in sauce to be edible, you've got problems. \nThe sides went from nondescript and undercooked (collard greens) to strange (black, pinto and kidney?) and tasteless (Baked beans). The corn bread was like no other I've ever tasted (either made with white or yellow cornmeal) and not in a good way. \nHaving said all that, I might actually have given the place another shot...if it wasn't so crazy expensive. The exact same amount of food (and better quality, I might add) can be had at any number of barbecue restaurants in the city for around $16.95. The total for the \"Big Blue\" was $25.95. If you are going to charge those prices - you should be able to back it up with quality. \n\nI hate giving a bad review - I mean, look at how few I've given - but this place needs to step it up. Until then - I have to say avoid it.", "author": "Jamie M."}

I came here as soon as they opened so that I could try, yet again, to have great BBQ in the bay area. Yet again, I have failed. I don't know why it's impossible to cook and serve great smoked 'cue in this part of the country...but apparently it is.\n\nThe food was...average/not-so-great. The pulled pork was a lame attempt at north carolina-style 'cue that came out sweet, yet bland. The vinegar-type sauce they provided fell short of rescuing it. The brisket was...NOT EVEN BRISKET. It was like \"pulled beef\" or something. They advertised texas brisket and it's not even sliced, true-blue brisket in any sense. It was actually kinda tasty, but who cares...it's not brisket! The XXX hot sauce was not mind-blowing hot, nor was it anything more than a limited imitation of Texas Peet's hot sauce. Lastly, we had the baby back ribs. These were actually good. The only redeeming part of the meal. Go for these ribs, and don't bother with anything else. The ribs were actually great. Pricey for the Mission, but great.\n\nNow...the service. I don't usually write about the service at any place where a meal is less than $20. I don't really care in these situations. But Baby Blues made me care. So here I am writing about it. We waited 10 minutes to get anybodys attention. We couldn't sit because they hadn't bussed the tables that were empty. Once we sat, we didn't get a menu for another 10 minutes, and couldn't order for an additional 20 minutes. That's 40 minutes BEFORE ordering. The food came 30 minutes after that. It's BBQ! It should have been smoked hours ago...an order of BBQ does not require more than 5 minutes to put on the plate and possibly heat a little bit. This was ridiculous. So....70 minutes in, the food arrived. We ate, and then it took them another 30 minutes post-meal to bring us our bill. This is just unacceptable, particularly on a Saturday night. I am the most lenient person when it comes to service, but this was outta line.\n\nNow, I know, they just opened. Our server said as much several times (nice guy too). But still, the pure time and negligence was so bad, they shouldn't have opened under those conditions.\n\nLastly, the decor here was not thought-out at all. The interior looks like it supposed to be a bit up-scale, much more than your typical BBQ joint. Clean lines and walls, limited decoration. But...it was just bad. The colors were a mute grey-blue, very bleak. The lighting was white fluorescent. All bad...a BBQ place should be down-home and inviting, with warm feelings and colors, like wood and cowhide and lanterns or something. Or maybe a checkered tablecloth. Whatever. As a down-home place, it failed. As an up-scale place, they would have to hire an interior decorator. The wall-sized windows also don't work...you only want windows like that if you have something to look at. All you see here is a Kragen Auto Parts and the ghettoness of the Mission/Bernal heights stretch. Not an inviting vista.\n\nSo to sum it up, average food (except the ribs), unacceptable service, and terrible  atmosphere/decor. Not worth it. Again, a bay area BBQ failure.", "author": "Tolga E."}

This restaurant is delicious and a MUST re-visit. We went in on a busy Friday night. I ordered pulled pork with mashed sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was TO DIE FOR! Absolutely delicious! The sweet potato mash was tasty but i guess im just not really a fan of sweet potato mash. The pulled pork was amazing and juicy without any added BBQ sauce. My bf got the brisket which was surprising but good nevertheless. We were expecting sliced beef and got what looked like pulled pork, just beef. \n\nThe restaurant brags about their XXL sauce which i found to be awful tasting. The regular BBQ sauce is much better. \n\nAlso, the service was less than perfect! We were fine with a wait because we showed up at prime dinner time on a Friday night, however im not that cool with being quoted a time, and exceeding that time by a long shot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-05", "description": "Let me start by saying I really want this place to succeed and will try them a few more times before giving up but my first experience last night left a lot to be desired.   I waited a few weeks after opening to try this neighborhood restaurant for a couple reasons.  One is I like to give a new place some time to work out the opening bugs.  The other is signage - or lack thereof.  The restaurant has no exterior signage with the name of the place so I had no idea how to call in a take out order.  My friend Kurt and his boyfriends wound up going this past Tuesday and he brought me a menu yesterday so I knew I would call in an order on my way home.\n\nMy concern continued when I called in a pretty simple order (one whole chicken and three sides) and was told it would be 20 minutes.  OK - I can handle that even though I'd be passing by on my way from 24th St BART to home in about 10 minutes.  So I get there and no one greets me.  There is no signage regarding take out.  I get the attention of the bartender and say I'm early for a take out order and she goes to check but doesn't come back and tell me anything.  The place is LOUD.  Hard surfaces everywhere, a cheap , tinny sound system blaring music and the visual assault of a large screen tuned to ESPN.  I continue to stand by the bar but am not offered a drink - which I would have gladly bought to dull the noise and ease the wait.  \n\nI want to get someone's attention to ask if they can run my card so that when my order is up I can go but the staff is pretty much running in circles.  This became more frustrating as eventually I could see what I was certain was my order bagged and ready.  The person behind the bar approaches me with my check (and not a bag) and I give her my card and she takes it while running to answer the phone.  She stays on the phone a few minutes and returns with my card.  I sign and she runs for the phone again.  I'm waiting and she eventually gets another waiter near her to bring me the bag.  I ask if there is any sauce in it (it's a BBQ joint!) and she says no and goes to get some of each of the two available.  I'm pleasant as I say thanks - now 35 minutes after placing my order - 25 of them observing the chaos under unpleasant conditions.\n\nAnyway - they're new, I'm hopeful and hungry and only a couple blocks from home.  I get home and open the bag.  The sides are already a disappointment in size: three 1/2 pint containers: mashed potatoes (delicious) baked beans (OK but not baked enough - too saucy) and collard greens (pretty good but oddly saucy too).  I plate a little of each then open the chicken package.  Smells good and looks like a lot but wait something's wrong.  I mentioned I ordered a whole chicken and expected to see just that - perhaps cut in 1/4s but would have been fine whole.  Instead there are four 1/4s.  Now none of my friends would confuse me for a breast man and that goes for my taste in chicken too.  But the four 1/4s I was looking at were all breast/wing 1/4s.  Four of 'em.  I was looking forward to a leg/thigh which, to me, tastes better and also stays moister through a long smoking and would have left the expected two breasts for my roommate later or myself if super tasty.  \n\nSo, already disappointed on a lot of levels I cut up a breast/wing and no way this spent a long time in a smoker.  Roadside, for example, smokes their chickens 4 hours (and their pulled pork and brisket for 17!)  so that it's falling off the bone but this was actually difficult to separate the wing.  Don't get me wrong -  I am not saying it was undercooked - it was fully cooked - but not slow smoked by a long shot.\n\nLast straw - I spent $30 on one chicken and three sides an no corn muffins?  \"They come with all the meals and this is the same as two meals and there should have been at least a couple in there.  I'm pretty sure I didn't see them in the sides section or I would have even bought them.\n\nLike I said, I *really* want to like this place and for it to succeed.  It's joined a neighborhood of very good restaurants who all do a large amount of take out so they will need to streamline that operation: signage, promptness, something to do while waiting - like selling me a drink - would all be good starters.\n\nI'd like to see them publish their smoke times, temperatures and woods used - BBQ eaters care about these things.  And BBQ eaters who do their own smoking (like me in a Kamado) *really *care.  \n\nI'll try more of their sides too - but think the portions should be full pints when a la carte at that price: they are as GFC up the street and at Petes @ 20th.  \n\nI'm very happy to see catfish and shrimp on the menu which don't require long smoking for flavor/tenderness but am leery of the ribs and brisket if they are anything like the chicken.  And finally, when someone orders a whole chicken - give them one - preferably from one bird but at list try and replicate the parts from one.  \n\nI promise to be back soon - hope it gets better.", "author": "Jon R."}

That said, I didn't appreciate eating cold chicken in a restaurant.  Yes I said cold.  I ordered the smoked chicken, which I have enjoyed before, and the breast was charred on the outside, but literally cold on the inside when I cut into it.  No one once asked me how my food was so I didn't say anything.  Besides I don't send food back; just my philosophy after working in the restaurant field for a few years.  Instead I ate the delicious sides and the thigh/leg section which was not cold.  The breast came home with me and made a nice sandwich later.  So overall quality can be spotty and service is minimalist to put it kindly.  Hopefully they see this review and make sure not to serve people old food they forgot to reheat.

I for some reason thought it was a one time thing and decided to give them a chance anyway based on the fact that much is forgiven if the food is bombtastic. We waited for over 45 mins for a table last night....every 20 mins it was another 20 mins..it was busy and I get that sometimes you have to wait for good food. The staff at this place is stellar hence the two stars...however that is their only saving grace!! Once we were seated our server was nice and informed us that they were out of both sweet tea and unsweetened tea.....while reviewing the menu he was also very helpful in answering our questions about what was good and what was not.\n\nMy husband and I shared a mixed meat plate I believe it was the Baby Blues Plate...we got SHredded Beef...Pork Ribs (Memphis) and Chicken....our friends ordered a mixed plate as well with Catfish...Ribs..Chicken...Shrimp...so needless to say we had all of the meats covered at our table....we also got the Okras...Creamed Spinach...Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens. It took them almost an hour to bring our order over to us...not once did they check in to say that it would be right up or to bring the sodas that we ordered to replace the very awful tasting \"blue kool aid\" (I mean who messes up Kool Aid but that is another story). It would have been helpful to at least have some cornbread to eat since we were starving!! It was also at this point that I realized our wait had been this long based on the fact that the kitchen took a looooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg time to get the food prepared and to the tables.\n\nThe food came just as we were about to eat our arms off...The meat was luke warm and over cooked. The chicken was dry and did not taste good at all in fact all I could taste was charred over-cooked meat. I even got dark meat...dry dark meat just ain't right...in fact it is down right NASTY. The Catfish had a gassy after taste no doubt from the gas grill being used. The ribs were ok nothing to write home about  but I can do better ribs in my oven and the shrimp was decent....although it was a little over cooked but I can forgive that. I asked the server why it took such a long time to get our food to the table and he said...\"they just opened and they are still trying to figure things out\" We also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out... our server did say \"at least we did not run out of ribs this time\" We ended up ordering cold pecan pie which was not bad and cold peach betty/cobbler... Cobbler should be warm with vanilla ice cream...I think they offer these two dishes cold so that they can be made ahead and get to your table before the night turns into day!! The peach betty was ok but they used canned peaches which for me is unforgiveable.....\n\nHaving eaten BBQ in North Carolina....Kansas City and Georgia this ain't cutting it for me!! The meat lacked so much in so many ways.... I was not impressed with the wait time...the food or for that matter the decor. If the food was good I could get over having to wait for it...with so many yummy dining options in the mission I would for sure pass this one up. If their meats are slow cooked for 18 hours then the flavor and taste should be tasted all the way to the bones...there was little to no flavor in anything that I ate last night. I really wanted to like this place because I love me some BBQ but once again San Francisco has proved itself to be a foodie paradise in many ways but not when it comes to BBQ.  I may visit their LA restaurant to see how it compares but something tells me it may not be any better.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-29", "description": "BBQ is like religion: people get a lot of enjoyment and reassurance out of it, and people get pretty (freaking) heated about it, too.  Not long ago I was in Texas and got all kinds of conflicting advice about where to go for barbeque, with explicit opinions that reminded me of, well, asking people what denomination was the best.  Lots of dreamy looks when talking about their favorite, and lots of fiery indignation when talking about the other (whoever the other may be). \n\nI'm sure that if Baby Blues was in Texas there'd be some polarization about the place, possibly at the same level there is from what I'm seeing in the reviews here.  Though personally, I really don't see what's not to like about this place.  Attentive, knowledgeable service: as shown by our waitress who checked in regularly and came over to tell us about the several cheeses in the mac & cheese.  A good location: as evidenced by being able to park within a block of the place, right on the street, no problem.  A nice space: good light, a good view of the street, comfortable chairs, and all that.  A good beer and (short, but adequate) wine list.  \n\nAnd right, the food.  We had brisket, pulled pork, a link, baby back ribs, slaw, potato salad, mac & cheese, and corn bread.  The brisket was properly cooked and prepared, as was the pork.  The link was surprisingly spicy (though easy to handle) and good, too.  The ribs were just right as well, bone-gnawingly delicious.  The buttermilk style slaw was exactly the way I prefer it - more savory than sweet, crunchy, fresh, generously portioned.  The flavors of the potato salad were spot on, and while I thought the potato bits were a bit larger than they should have been, the lack of uniformity bespoke a home-madedness that overcomes that kind of quibble.  The corn bread is in the traditional, savory style as well - I like the cake-style better, but I can recognize that for folks who like cornbread in this way it was very nicely done.  The mac & cheese was, well, divine.  The different cheeses complimented each other very nicely, adding a great depth to the side that my date and I loved.  \n\nI'm not from a major BBQ producing region of the country so I don't have much of a vested interest in the style one way or the other.  Memphis, Texas, Carolina; pig, beef, chicken; cheesy mac, cole slaw, potato salad: whatever's there, I'll eat and if it's good I'll like it.  So I don't have a problem with the fusion aspect of barbeque here.  And the portions are generous enough that my date and I split a Blue Devil and had leftovers for the next day.\n\nSo three meals from one ($30) entree, which I think puts a good spin on their price points, which I though were reasonable.  We will be back and we will be bringing friends and we will be telling others.  They're doing God's work here, and as long as you're not some overwrought vegetarian, or some other such misguided unrealistic affected vainglorious pissant, you will see the light.", "author": "Jacob R."}

His Friend Susan suggested we go to Bably Blues BBQ in the mission. I love BBQ so I was willing to try it.\n\nLet me start by saying I'm a big fan of Everett and Jones BBQ in Jack London Square because of their Briskett and their Spicy BBQ Sauce.\n\nWe were seated quickly, the place was full, loved the fact that the bar serves plenty of pulled beers especially Guiness! I opted for iced tea; they offer regular (not flavored thank god) and sweet tea; unlimited refilss too!\n\nThe menu is amazing, lots to choose from, the prices started from $13.95 up to $31.95. Everything comes with 2 sides or \"fixins\" and corn bread. I chose \"The Three Kings\" because I wanted to try their ribs, it has Briskett and I like chicken. My \"fixins\" were Mac n Cheese and mashed sweet potatoes.\n\nWhat was presented to me by our ever so friendly waitress was a mound of food that looked delicious. Before I continue, I was asked if I like white or dark chicken meat. I'm a thigh and wing fan but was told I could only have thigh/leg and breast/wing; Now why is that?\n\nThe ribs were big, moist, the meat came right off the bone. There are three sauces to choose from which were mild, medium, and spicy/hot all with a vinegar base and added a nice touch to the Briskett. \nThe Briskett was more of a pulled pork and not the nice slices with a crispy topping I'm used to at E and J's. It tasted great but I just wouldn't call it Briskett.  The Chicken was moist, had a nice grilled taste and I had that wrapped up in a to go box for lunch today. \nThe sides were tasty, served hot. The Mac and Cheese was my favorite side, it's one of those dishes that takes me back to my childhood and this did just that, I should have ordered a double side of this. The sweet mashed sweet potatoes were good too, can't complain about them but wished I would have ordered mashed potatoe since I'm a fan. The cornbread was unique, not sure what they do to it but it was brown instead of yellow  but had a \"Stick to your ribs\" quality that I liked and was moist and not crumbly. I used it to sop up the Sweet Potatoes and bbq Sauce.\nI'd definitely come back to this place.", "author": "David P."}

We called the owner Paul earlier in the day to say we had closer to 20 people than the original 12-14 that we'd mentioned to him, and his ready response was \"Bring it on!\"  I liked this place already.\n\nThey had our tables ready when we arrived, and they started us off by passing around BBQ shrimp.  Deeelicious (and I don't even eat shrimp -- it just looked too good to pass up!).  Paul told my fiance that if we were ok with it, he'd give us a set price per person (very reasonable) and just keep bringing out different dishes and sides.  That was an excellent suggestion considering the size of our group, and it worked out perfectly.  Out came the BBQ chicken, ribs, catfish, hot links...along with mashed sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, greens, mac & cheese, and cornbread (to die for!).  Paul and his daughter (who was our server) did a fantastic job of keeping us eating and drinking and everyone loved the food!  Let's just say its no small feat to do that with a big table of 20 people.  After dinner, the plates of dessert came out with pecan pie, key lime pie, kahlua cake etc...the kahlua cake was divine.  \n\nPaul was terrific throughout the entire meal -- always making sure \"the birthday girl\" had a beer or glass of wine, bringing out extra desserts and making sure we'd all had enough, etc.  As we were getting ready to leave, my friend accidentally knocked a bottle of wine I'd been given as a gift from the bench to the floor, shattering it.  Paul cleaned it up and made a little joke about it, and as an incredibly sweet gesture, he brought over a bottle of his best Syrah to replace it as a gift.  I was floored!  He and his staff really went out of the way to make us happy, and his friendliness and his kitchen's amazing cooking helped to make my birthday very special.  \n\nIt's hard to satisfy a group of 20 hungry people, and Baby Blues definitely delivered!

Avoid the Philly fanatic fratboy with the halting, annoying-ass cadence as your server and you probably have a good chance of getting your food or whatever requests you have before the bill arrives. Dude seemed completely out of it when I asked for a sweet tea refill, left my glass on the bar all the while walking around servicing everyone else in sight. In fact, he seemed pretty jovial with everyone else except when WE needed something. Undeterred by this smarmy prick, I still managed to enjoy the pulled pork sandwich smothered with coleslaw and a side 'fixin' of shell-shaped mac'n cheese. It finally became clear that this moron was either hopelessly forgetful or just downright avoiding us after nearly 15 minutes of waiting & STILL trying to flag his ass down for my refill. Only when we finished our meals did this guy utter ANYTHING of significance (yes, we might actually need the check, you douche). On the next visit, I arrived with a bigger group of people as Mr. Philly made his exit...perfect timing. The servers this time around were friendlier, but clumsy (one broke a few dishes in a span of a few minutes) and running into chairs while in high-heels. The Memphis style pork long rib came seasoned well, not overdone & not exactly falling-off-the-bone tender, but just tender enough. The big surprise came in the form of their collard greens. Had plenty kick to it and could possibly be a meal on its own or with a side of their perfectly made cornbread. The condiments include a zesty, tangy BBQ sauce, a less piquant and subtly sweeter version & a ketchup bottle of nearly weapons-grade tabasco sauce.

Call me crazy but i thought bbq was suppose to be hot and saucy. The pulled pork had potential, I had to add some vinegar to give it a boost in flavor, ribs were nice and moist but lacked flavor. It didn't have that zesty tangy, burnt, smokey and crispy goodness that I liked. And the worse of the three was the dry and rubbery bbq chicken tasted like cafeteria food or something you would get in the freezer aisle. For the sides we ordered the runny, bland potato salad, and the mac and cheese that was okay.

He ordered the \"three kings\" which consisted of beef brisket, ribs, and chicken along with two fixin's: mac n' cheese and collared greens. It came with a cornbread. As you can tell this isn't a light meal so come on an empty stomach. Okay, I'll talk about the food now.

The mashed sweet potatoes were my favorite!!! It wasn't too sweet and you can tell there is a hint of orange juice in it! Divine. The collared greens were in a sauce that made it too rich. I like it plain and simple. The meats were all tender but the sauce I recommend to go with it is this concoction they have: apple cider vineger and chili extract. That made it even more delicious! Oh also, they have XXX hot sauce which I loved.

The mashed potatoes were good the first time, tasted weird the second time. The BBQ is less than average. Not impressive. I've been twice, the ribs were a dried out and some were basically charcoal on a bone. The brisket was at least edible. Both flavorless, with a crappy bland sweet sauce.  The sauce tastes pretty generic and very sugary, like they bought it from Safeway, added water and sugar, then over sauced the meat with it to cover up that it is burnt and bland. There is a difference between the charred flavor of food done on a grill or BBQ and just plain burnt.  Corn bread was a little weird, with actual corn kernels in it and kind of dry on the outside and soggy on the bottom. Maybe that's a southern thing that I don't get cause I'm from the pacific NW.  Another reviewer commented that her burger was way over done. I would have to agree. My friend ordered medium and it was definitely medium well. Also, the mashed sweet potatoes tasted good, but the texture made me gag. They didn't mash them well and there were a lot of little stringy fiber things left in.  Maybe below average is what you get from a chain restaurant (or is it a franchise?), who's other restaurant is in So Cal and not from Memphis.?! Basically, there isn't much that's positive about the food. I'm not a BBQ expert, and I don't think you need to be to know that this place is below average. I could go as high as 2 stars, but the prices seemed out of sync with the quality (below average).", "author": "Lin N."}

Have been looking for a good bbq place in the SF for awhile and just haven't come across one.  I don't make it out to this part of town too often but figured while I was there I would try out the place I had heard so many good things about.   Ordered pulled pork with two sides and my husband got the st louis style ribs with two sides.  We were very excited to get 4 different sides to share.  I got the pork and beans and coleslaw, he got the baked beans an mac and cheese.  All of the sides were a disappoint and even more disappointing, the pork and beans were just their \"baked beans\" with pork on top, neither of which were technically baked beans or pork and beans.\n  On top of the sides not tasting great they were all cold, as were our entrees.  The pulled pork was fine but needed a sauce to have any flavor, with 6 different sauces to try I figured I would find one I liked but I couldn't.  The ribs were not thoroughly cooked and required a steak knife to cut!\nAnd after all that we asked about their desserts and the waiter proceeded to tell us that their regulars usually order dessert first because it is so good and because you can take home left over dinner but not dessert.  First off his pitch made him seem like a car dealer and second whose to say I can't take a piece of pie home.  But I guess he didn't want me to look silly taking home pie, so for that I thank him.", "author": "Stefanie N."}

It's all NC style, which means it's got a bit too much vinegar for my taste.   but i think this is a matter of taste, not quality, which is why the reviews on yelp are so binary\n* finally, i had a bit of a weird experience with the owner.  i happened to be standing next to him and he asked me how my meal was.  i said \"excellent\" and he was pleased, I walked away.  Then I thought for a minute and went back and said \"actually, one thing, the cornbread wasn't my favorite - I like what you're trying to do but I'd prefer a more classic-style cornbread.\"  His response to this was, no joke, to just ignore me - look away and kind of act like I wasn't there anymore.

Finding a place that has great meat, great sauce, and great sides is a challenge. I grew up in Texas eating a lot of barbecue so I pretty much know what I'm looking for. The food here is excellent. We ordered a mix of different meats and sides and we liked everything. To make things even better, Paul (the owner) and his daughter gave us excellent service and clearly Paul is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his food. If you decide to eat here definitely ask for Paul and chat with him about how he cooks his meat....you'll learn something new I assure you. We will be eating here often!

We were going to have Mexican food, but our spot was closed. I decided on getting the  1/2 Memphis Long Ribs and  1/2 Baby Back Ribs. I was quite hungry. The \"Tripple-X\" sauce was awesome and hot. The ribs were over cooked and when they were pulled apart it was not fall off the bone and I had to fight the meat resulting in two ribs worth of meat on one bone, leaving the neighboring bone naked and lonely. I might be picky, but I feel that if I can cook a more tender rib (which I suck at) then you shouldn't be charging 25 bucks for ribs. The mac and cheese side tasted like they were made from a box. When we walked in the restaurant, it was about half full (or half empty as the tone of this review is going). It filled up after we ordered and it took a real long time for us to get refills on our drinks. They were nice about it and admitted that they lagged and didn't charge us for a round. I appreciate the free round, but if I'm sitting right next to the bar it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The waitress was hot and flirty, but it still doesn't make up for it. I'm here for ribs, not hot chicks. Justin's beef brisket was tasty, but I'm not a brisket fan. I might go back and try the pulled pork but the ribs are off my list.", "author": "Dustin S."}

This is nice to me because it doesn't wipe away the taste of all the sides. The flavors of all the sides were a bit mild to my liking and I wasn't too impressed with the sauce. *I've spent some time in Dallas, TX* Overall, we all came to the agreement that this place is sure to be around for a while. The Servers are really sharp and very very friendly. We were greeted by a gentleman who we later learned is the owner (forgot his name). He presented himself as person who really takes pride in his product. Great service is always a big plus for me. If they keep this up during my next few visits, I'll bump'em up another star.

There was nothing in this place remotely inviting.  For only being open a few months, the place already looked run down & neglected. The floors were filthy; everything looked haphazard. The bartender was eating behind the counter; the guy in the food line was eating while preparing food (gross); another guy in the food line kept taking off his cap & smoothing down his hair - he did not wash his hands after doing this, nor did he put on gloves for food prep. The waitress' jeans were so low her behind was showing; the pants looked like they would fall off any moment.  She kept pulling them up, taking orders, bringing food to the table - not very sanitary. We ordered a platter of ribs & chicken.  The ribs were so dry it looked like there was no meat on the bones. The mac & cheese had big chunks of cream cheese in it - very strange. Cornbread was burnt.  The chicken & sweet potatoes were ok.  We didn't even stay for dessert. The lack of professionalism was unbelievable. The place was such a turn-off.

My brisket was tender, juicy and had that sweet smoky flavor of well cooked meat.  My sides TOTALLY stood up to the main.  The pork and beans had big chunks of pulled pork thorough out and was sweet and seculant.  The potato salad was one of the best potato salads I have ever had, tart and sooooooo good.  I usually hate okra (so slimy) but loved it here, it is flash fried with vinegar and had great flavor.  My boyfriend's smoked chicken rice was pretty boring (I'd opt out of that).  The cornbread was coarse, moist and dense -loved it.  My boyfriend got the chicken which was equally good.  We both agreed that the flavor of all the meats did not need to be spoiled with sauces but tried the sauces none the less which were quite tasty (we tested them on the bland rice).

A friend's burger was extremely undercooked on one of our visits.  I think the sides are just okay.  My husband loves the blue cheese stuffed burger.  I like the baby back ribs!  The decor in this place is seriously lacking--the area where the employees put their jackets and purses was RIGHT next to our table in the corner--strange having employees getting ready to work out in the open like that.  Pretty weird if you ask me.  Tables are overcrowded too.  I go to this place because I like meat and it's close to my pad.", "author": "Jo M."}

We (3) went there on a Sunday afternoon soon after they opened  and were seated right away by a very friendly host who also was our waiter. We ordered off the lunch special section of the menu, which had some very good deals on some delicious looking meals(served 12pm to 4pm daily) . 2 of us ordered  the Cherokee Spike platter and one ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The wait for our food wasn't more than 10 mins. When it arrived , I couldn't believe the amount of food on the platter. The portions were huge. With a combo of pulled pork,hot link, and beef brisket, along with cornbread and a side of baked beans. It was hard to believe this was the lunch special (all for $11.95). The other platter  person in our party got the side of cole slaw which was also delicious. The pulled pork sandwich was also huge with alot of meat and a topping of cole slaw , with a side of mashed sweet potato. Also very delicious. The total bill for us with 2 ice teas and 1 kool aid was $38.00. One of the best lunches we ever had in the city. We'll definately be back.", "author": "R D M."}
