We walked around after our dinner at the famous Chinese restaurant Z & Y, it was good exercise after a big dinner though. \n\nMany little stores sell vintage like stuffs that can't be find anywhere else, sister and I got a few QiPao which are traditional Chinese dresses that are very tight and body hugging. The murals around were amazing too, we particularly loved the Bruce Lee and monkey king murals that were amazing arts. I also saw some nicer Chinese restaurants and a few Chinese bars around, too bad we couldn't try some of those cause we had to take parents back after a long sightseeing day. \n\nAbsolutely tour this historical Chinatown, eat at one of the restaurants, have some drinks at one of the bars, get one of those traditional Chinese dresses.

Street vendors would scream and people would make snide comments as they flowed down the river of people. Add in the tourist and it was definitely mayhem.\n\nHowever, now that I'm grown and I've seen other versions of Chinatowns across North America, SF Chinatown is truly unique! \n\nThe pushing/shoving, street vendors, and deals under the table to get rid of produce after peak hour adds a flavor and a richness that most others can't replicate. I've literally seen the fish monger chase a runaway fish out his door, a produce maven sell tomatoes at $1 a bag so they don't go bad, and watched mom buy honey loquats from a street vendor whose quality looked better than the store. Compare this to many other Chinatowns and you'll easily see the experiences are second to none!\n\nMy favorite shop definitely belongs to Mong Kok Bakery which makes sky high green onion bread! Second is probably the fortune cookie shop just from childhood memories. And last, Golden Gate Bakery is good too...you know, if they ever open.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Known most as the end destination for Sun Wukong (the Monkey King) in the epic Journey to the West. The sequel: Journey to the West: Morning After Dim Sum was TERRIBLE!! Zhang Ziyi was totally miscast as Niu Mo Wang!! (Before you rush on to IMDB, I'm making this up. I do that. I'm bored.)\n\nI've always been a fan of everything Chinese. Chinese cuisine, traditional Chinese music, plus I'm probably the only European-American around who wears nothing but Chinese shirts. What can I say: it's my bag, man!

Too bad she was married.\n\nAnyhoo-- Chinatown in San Francisco is a must do at least once. But, it's really just one big tourist trap with numerous shops selling cheap souvenirs, and myriad Chinese restaurants. Some are good, some aren't. I would assume they have some really cool events during the year; such as the lunar festival, mid-autumn festival, and Joy Luck Club festival. But, I've only been there during non-exciting weekends, so I find it not much different than Chinatown LA. But, it does have a different vibe than that of LA: probably because it's so iconic and it just breathes cultural history. Fun place to stroll around, browse through the lovely cheongsam (though they always make my butt look fat) and to stop in for some dim sum.

I have several clients in the neighborhood and I am always treated with so much kindness and respect even when I am butchering the language trying to order at a hole in the wall restaurant. Most of the time I just get a laugh or a smile with a point of the finger at the item I want. This weekend we just happened to find a prime parking spot 1 block away from the start of the Autumn Moon festival. I was in awe with the crowds that came out to celebrate. All the vendors were very nice and willing to explain in English the products they were selling. Some of the stands were definitely local only as it was a controlled chaos, dont think for a moment I didnt get in to the mix, My wife just shook her head at me like I was a kid in a candy store.

There's something about this city that attracts people from around the world who are looking for a one of a kind experience. Chinatown in San Francisco is different from other Chinese communities around the United States. As soon as you set foot into this community, you'll be tempted to further explore what it has to offer.\n\nSan Francisco has a large Chinese population who stay true to their culture. Rich traditions are handed down from one generation to another. A lot of the elderly population within this community speak little English so it's difficult to communicate with them from time to time. \n\nOf course you'll find the trinket shops selling toys and noisemaker fireworks. Several jewelry and home decor shops sell products that are unique to the area. However, what I found to be absolutely fascinating was the herbal shops that carried oils and herbs to cure/heal common ailments. All that you need to do is to describe your issue and they've got the perfect remedy for you! We purchased some of the Chinese oils for joint pain and migraines. We use it as needed and it has proven to be highly effective! \n\nAnother draw to San Francisco Chinatown is the authentic food! McDonalds and Burger King cannot he found here! The restaurants are often very small and do not have a lot of the modern flairs that you'd see in the larger chain restaurants. A lot of the menus are bilingual, written in Chinese and English with photos to accompany each selection. My husband was ecstatic to find a couple of restaurants that had dim sum and chicken buns. Although you can find these dishes anywhere, you can't beat the taste of authentic Chinese street foods. It's different from what you would be served at a full-service restaurant. \n\nWhat I love about San Francisco Chinatown is that it's super cute! The colorful Chinese lanterns are prominently displayed from one block to another, high above the streets. The entrance to Chinatown has two dragon statues to welcome you here. People are friendly and filled with many stories that they love to share! San Francisco Chinatown is not to be missed as it's such a fun place to visit. It leaves you with an appreciation of Chinese customs and culture.", "author": "Michelle T."}

The oldest Chinatown in North America, pre-dating the Gold Rush, circa 1849. Yet, before I talk Chinatown, why am I quoting Bruce Lee when he was raised in Hong Kong? Because many don't know Bruce Lee was born in San Francisco Chinatown. Did you know? If you're a Bruce Lee fanatic or just watched one of a dozen Hollywood movies of his life you probably already knew, but hey, Bruce Lee was American! \n\nSo I can talk about Dim Sum, the fruit markets, the murals, the baos... like the other hundreds of reviews. But I'm not into repetition and boring you on how the best place for Egg Tarts (Dan Tat) is at Golden Gate Bakery on Grant (you should know). Instead let's talk about... The myth... The legend... \n\nThe legend of Bruce Lee. Some might wonder shouldn't he be talked about in Hong Kong where his movie success began... or perhaps talked about in Seattle where he began teaching Martial Arts, and where he is buried at Lake View Cemetery, R.I.P. Nah, I choose to talk about Bruce Lee's association in San Francisco Chinatown because as the urban legend goes this is where it all began...\n\nBack in the day, when Bruce Lee moved from Hong Kong back to San Francisco for a better education, he lived with his older brother in Chinatown. He eventually moved up to Seattle to attend college (where he met his wife) and shortly after began to teach martial arts. Lee was already a master of many techniques of the arts. The difference was he was willing to teach the ancient arts to anyone. Not only Chinese. He opened his doors to all, including \"Gweilo\" (non-Chinese). His fame grew and so did his successes... eventually word got out within the secretive martial arts community and somehow this had to be stopped. Bruce Lee must be stopped!\n\nEnter Wong Jack Man (correct spelling, trust). Wong was a master in several fighting disciplines including, T'ai chi ch'uan, Xingyiquan, and the Shaolin technique. Wong had a fierce following of traditionalists and overall the majority within the community. Who is this Bruce Lee punk teaching \"our\" martial arts to \"outsiders\"? Of course, there's the Hollywood version of the fight, then there's the urban legend of the fight, but make no mistake, be it in the underground of Oakland or San Francisco, it did happen. If Wong Jack Man won... Bruce Lee must stop teaching outsiders. If Lee won he was free to choose to teach the ancient arts to anyone. Long story short... the match lasted only 3 minutes, Lee pummeling his opponent, and as the story goes... Wong Jake Man was literally running away in the end! The legend of Bruce Lee is born... \n\nIn the end, San Francisco Chinatown is a great place for all, yes including you \"Outsiders\" lol. It is no longer ruled by the dark underworld of the 19th century Tongs, or more recently the Triads. Today, it's all about capitalism and great places to eat! You can find some of the best Chinese cuisine & baos anywhere! It's predominantly Cantonese, so it retains that vibrant Hong Kong vibe. And visit during Chinese Lunar New Year... it's happening! \n\nSo next time when in San Francisco Chinatown remember this is where the legend of Bruce Lee was born. A legacy intact 'til the end of time. It's really a wonderful story when you think about it... a young man breaking away from the prejudices of his own society to become an icon for all the people. It's definitely a story that should be told. We can dismiss Big Trouble in Little China, starring Kurt Russel, har har oh please. Enter The Dragon...\n\n\"Love is like a friendship caught on fire.

Where do I start in preparing a review of San Francisco Chinatown? I have been there numerous times as a child all the way to a senior citizen now. What is there for me to say when some of my fellow yelpers (Victor G, William L, Tiffany D) have already mentioned it with stellar reviews? \n\nI grew up in a Chinatown that is across the Bay - Oakland Chinatown. I don't want to do any comparing as to which city has the better Chinatown. However, I have a preference as to which one is more convenient to go to by public transportation and which one has the flat surface walking on the pavement. Besides I was born, raised and grew up on the east side of the bay.  \n\nSan Francisco Chinatown brings back childhood memories of some of the weekend outings to the Chinese movie houses (World Theater, Great Star Theater and a third theater on Grant) with my mom, brothers and sisters while my dad go and visit his association on Clay Street for social activities among his compadres. (I'm not going to elaborate as to what went on in the back room.)  After the movies, some of the time my family and I dined at the old Sam Wo Restaurant. It was a hole in the wall joint that was opened late. They had to shut down back in 2012 due to food safety concerns and rodent problems in the kitchen. About two years ago, Sam Wo reopened. I have yet to dine at the new one.\n\nThe memories also include the wedding banquets, red egg ginger parties and the Chinese New Year parades that I have attended. Two years ago, I attended the Autumn Moon Festival on Grant Avenue. The festival was okay. I'm not much of a fan for mooncakes, except for a small piece of doong yoong don wong yuet beng. I have to watch my sugar and carbs intake these days.\n\nWalking to SF Chinatown from Macy's in Union Square via Grant Avenue is not that bad. However, the  street becomes narrow at the entrance facing Bush Street. It is crowded with the local people and tourists. Occasionally I will see a few street vendors and street musicians along the way. Sometimes there are women handing out handbills to tourist to try a dim sum restaurant in the area.\n\nWith so many eateries, bakeries, souvenir shops and clothing stores around, I do have my favorite places to dine, shop and pick up dim sum, egg tarts and sesame balls.\n\nNew Woey Loy Guey for some home-style Cantonese dishes - pan fried pork hash with salted fish, stir fried chicken with shiitake mushrooms and veggies, snails. (Chinese soul food...lol)\n\nGolden Gate Bakery for the best egg tarts around. There's always a long line of people to savor these sweet delights.\n\nGood Mong Kok for dim sum and sesame balls. Three har gow for $2.10; three sesame balls for $1.80.\n\nWycen Foods on Stockton Street for an assortment of Chinese sausages aka lop cheung. They also carry other grocery items, such as mung bean vermicelli, snacks, hot sauce, canned goods, etc.\n\nEastern Bakery for coffee crunch cake, assorted sliced cake rolls, sesame balls, cow ear cookies aka ngow yee beng, moon cakes.\n\nPeking Bazaar for souvenir gifts, houseware items, clothes, jewelry and accessories.\n\nMow Lee Shing Kee Company for lop yuk aka preserved pork belly. I don't eat it, but my mom does and occasionally she has it with some steamed rice.\n\nOriental Pearl Restaurant on Clay Street is nice as far as ambiance is concerned for tourists, but the size of some of their dim sum leave a lot to be desired. \n\nStreet parking is about as impossible as it gets. Thus, the available parking is the Portsmouth Square Garage. The entrance is on Kearny Street between Clay and Washington Streets.", "author": "Carol C."}

I was one of those tourists. Having not visited San Francisco in years, I was quite excited to explore the city and Chinatown was on the top of my places to visit.\n\nChinatown was within walking distance of where I was staying and it wasn't to hard to see the Chinatown gate right at Grant Ave. As soon as I walked passed the gate, I was hit with the sights and sounds of Chinatown. There were storefronts selling all kinds of knick knacks from Chinese slippers to panda bears in silk clothing to magnets. The shopping stores were the first to line up along the Grant Ave, the restaurants and boba shop come a little later upon further walking.\n\nFor restaurants, there are several tourist drawn spots. San Francisco Chinatown is home to the oldest dim sum tea house in America (Hang Ah Tea Room), bakeries and restaurants that former presidents have visited (Great Eastern Restaurant where Obama made a surprise visit, Eastern Bakery visited by Clinton), and popular egg tart bakeries where people line up for hours (Golden Gate Bakery, Good Mong Kok Bakery). The restaurants and bakeries are a bit spread out so you'll definitely get your workout walking. (The hills here will give you your stair climber work out hehe).\n\nSan Francisco's Chinatown is a lot of fun! There is a lot to see as well as eat and drink. The one thing I did notice however it is pricier than other Chinatowns I've visited. I found that their souvenirs were pricier than the airport or at Pier 39 (For example same Hello Kitty plush was $14.99 here while $8.99 at Pier 39 and $10.99 at the airport! I also found a imitation Hello Kitty wallet for $8.99! It was imitation and for that price, I can get a real one at the Sanrio store. Just saying ;) lol) Dim sum wise, it was also way pricier than other spots (The cheapest dim sum dish where I visited was $4.50).

Chinatown brings customers (residents and tourists alike) of all ages to experience the Chinese's shopping and dining culture every year. Located at Grant Street near Bush Street, you'll enter at the Gateway Arch to welcome visitors in awe. Once you'll enter, you can see many attractions and local businesses especially classic architectures by giving Chinatown a tradition of prosperity and kindness.\n\nFor local shops across Chinatown, there are tons of goods to own like nick-knacks, mini statues and sculptures, original Chinese artworks (i.e. paintings and hand-written Chinese letters), delicious Chinese restaurants and baked goods and many more! Back in the 1990s, my parents and I are always coming to SF Chinatown the most because we wanted to shop their affordable goods. Chinese herbs is their top priority choice to shop which it's so rare to find in any Asian markets in Sacramento (i.e. dried Lingzhi and red ginseng roots). Speaking of baked goods, we always coming to Golden Gate Bakery the most which we enjoyed tasting and eating egg tarts especially for delicious fortune cookies from Golden Gate Fortune Cookies. For restaurant dining, I really enjoyed dining incredible Chinese foods. No matter how good it is, it always appetizing for everyone! Yummy!\n\nFurthermore, Chinatown has a wide arrange of attractions! Every day of every year, you can hear the sounds of every Chinatown residents by having conversations back and forth. Also, there's Tai Chi in Portsmouth Square, so you can relax your mood in ease without being too anxious. There's tons of street artworks across Chinatown too, so you can see every paintings represents the culture of China's everyday lives in a contemporary ways. Every year, Chinatown has a parade every February, so you can see many floats, acrobats and lion dancers throughout the whole day and night! It's fun for the whole family and friends!\n\nParking can be a challenge to park. If you're driving with an automobile, you can park at the surface metered parking nor the Portsmouth Square Parking garage if it's available for space. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nTo sum up, San Francisco's Chinatown is the most original and poignant neighborhood spot that I've always enjoyed and experience the Chinese culture and attractions all seasons long!

There are many shops and restaurants where immigrants start out.  The cultural beauty of the place is overtaken by high rents as many stores change hands.  Also, it's not the cleanest area.  Stockton St is the real Chinatown.  The produce off the sidewalk is overcrowded with food stands and shoppers. Thus, the sidewalks are filthy. Grant Ave. Is just a tourist mecca that doesn't represent the true Chinatown.  However patrons want to shop, there's plenty to see, shop and eat.", "author": "Angela W."}

You can literally spend a whole day here shopping and eating. \n\nYou know you're in Chinatown when the streets are littered with Asian faces and sidewalks filled with fruits/veggies and souvenir merchandises. I'd say price compare since I def saw similar items at diff shops at diff prices. \n\nParking will be a pain in the behind. Our group parked at the Portsmouth Square Garage. The total was $21 for half a day's adventure -- translating to about 6 to 7 hours. I will also have a review of this parking deck and a pic of the prices.

We found a parking garage and it wasn't too expensive. We had to walk a little ways, but this place is the epitome of the chinatown I've always wanted to visit. The smell is pungent with all sorts of food and a mixture of sewer, it's overcrowded with tourists and those that are browsing to get some groceries or buying something to eat, different voices shouting out numerous things, and good food for really cheap.\n\nDon't expect clean establishments or exceptional service. Come with an open mind and don't judge a store or restaurant by its front. Some of the best food are from here.

We got wor Wonton soup, Combo chow mein, a Side of assorted veggies, and xiao long bao dumplings at Hunan Home Kitchen. DELISH! The food is so rich and the service was great.

Plan your parking: There are some places located adjacent to China Town with ample parking -- and some of it is free! Nearly every space is free on Sundays.\n2.) Plan to walk: This is a city built on hills. Be prepared to walk up and down hill and over curbs.\n3.) Bring cash: Some stores just don't like it when you buy a $1 item and charge it with your credit card. Take some cash (in small bills) if you plan on shopping for inexpensive items (and there are A LOT of inexpensive items).\n4.) Dress for the weather: Weather in San Francisco can be chilly -- even in the summer. If you're going to be walking for a few hours, please remember to dress accordingly.\n5.) The famous \"Dragon's Gate\" entrance is located at the corner of Bush and Grant. This is just four blocks from Market Street -- not far from some of the taxi, trolley and bus stops as well as the underground Muni station.\n6.) The Chinese food in China Town can range from Americanized \"Chinese\" cuisine to authentic. Find what you like and try it!\n7.)

I think San Francisco's Chinatown keeps the heritage and culture there is for Chinese people.\n\nI also think that the Chinese New Year celebration is very authentic and super exciting to visit - where people purchase firecrackers - big or small and throw them everywhere on the ground. This is banned in other parts of the world such as Hong Kong because it's dangerous, but yet it's a tradition that is still kept in the States - I find this pretty interesting. \n\nAlthough it's Chinatown, the graffiti walls still adds a touch of the San Francisco culture, and like many like to say - where the East meets the West.

This Is reminiscent of when I lived in Taiwan for two years when I was very young.  It is probably the largest Chinese community outside Asia... and what's great about it is they seem to be always open! When looking for something to do on holidays when the whole country is closed for business where do we go... Chinatown, where everything is hustling and bustling like just a normal day. There's so much history and culture in the community and, yes, it's a tourist trap. \n\nLocated in downtown San Francisco, I've seen Chinatown during the day and evening. No matter how many times I visit Chinatown I always feel like a tourist. There's plenty to discover here most notably are the plentiful authentic restaurants, its produce and fish markets and stores. It's a place like no other.\n\nDined here a few times and ate at Chinatown Restaurant on Washington Street (yes, that's the name, as plain and simple can be) https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-restaurant-san-francisco-2?hrid=ebbrMvwZmVZs7iTFkTJiKg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct), New Woey Loy Goey Restaurant on Jackson Street https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-woey-loy-goey-restaurant-san-francisco-2?hrid=v9qh7bGjMRZJOlR0foy7rQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct), purchased baked good at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookies on Ross Alley https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-gate-fortune-cookies-san-francisco?hrid=0exnMQJp-Y8bA-bUIzK3yQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct) and the Golden Gate Bakery on Grant Ave https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-gate-bakery-san-francisco?hrid=v_aCF0MS1iUIfQRBUE90sQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)... and checked out many of the shops around. I remember also purchasing an 18k hoop earrings in one of the jewelry stores many years ago. \n\nParking! That's another story... it's always a challenge! If not able to find one within the area you may have to park on the outskirts and walk. Bring comfy shoes because steep hills may tire you easily. I'm also interested in doing the Chinatown 90-minute walking tour... there is a story about the Golden Dragon Massacre at the Imperial Palace and until this day the Imperial Palace is still open for business.\n\nReview #0633 (and 444th review for the business)", "author": "May A."}

It's probably the tourist trap I go to the most when I am in the city.  It's not for the knick-knack shops but for the food.  There are some really good authentic places to food here.  There are some garbage dumps too, but Yelp is pretty good in steering you in the right direction.\n\nI love how it really does feel like a city within a city.  What I don't love is that some of the places don't accept the good old credit card, but really it's still totally worth it to get the amazing food.\n\nThe other good part of this little gem is that it's up a hill.  It seems everything here is up hill from everything else.  And what better way to work off all that Dim Sum than to walk up hill both ways?!\n\nFor a traditional 'merican tourist, this might be a little \"too authentic\" and grungy.   But really, if you are coming to SF, you probably should be prepared for the dirtiest city you have ever been in, and Chinatown might be the dirtiest of the tourist parts.\n\nOne thing I want to stress.

Honestly, Grant Street is super touristy, but do what you want tourists, use those maps.  The best thing is word of mouth (aka YELP) and ask locals what to see and do.  \n\nCulture - SF Chinatown is filled with vibrant culture, foods, and trinkets.  All this is visible in the atmosphere.  What's great about Chinatown is the uniqueness of all the culture combined in one place.  You will get immersed in a variety of dialects, broadening your knowledge of all the Asian cultures.  The moment you enter, you're in a different world. \n\nFoods - When you go around any corner, you smell authentic Chinese cuisines.  Let's not forget those hanging roast ducks and pigs.  I love seeing people's facial expressions and picture taking moments when they come across these exotic dishes. The food is always cheap if you go to the right places.\n\nTrinkets - Bargaining 101 starts here.  Just remember when they say the price is 'FINAL', it never is.  Not having cash in Chinatown is not an option.  Banks and ATM's available.\n\nFor non-locals, don't forget to pick up some keepsakes and non-perishable items for your friends and family.  \n\nFor cheap salons and high quality, you can't beat the prices in Chinatown.

Just kidding! This review is my perspective as a visitor.\n\nThere's the fish, meat, and the many, very fresh, produce vendors. Granted the meat is not freshly killed just hours ago like in the villages inside China, but it'll do. However, some of the fish being sold are still swimming in aerated tubs. Prices for products  vary from vendor to vendor, but generally are better than what you would find at chain supermarkets. \n\nI won't go into the plethora of shops, bakeries and dining options available. Yelp reviewers have generously made their marks, by business names, for these categories. Local, wonderful Yelp friends have also shared their thoughts about this Chinatown. Edwin R., this IS a \"magical\" place. Ann S., I am \"transported\" to a foreign land without leaving U.S. soil.\n\nIt was amazingly enjoyable being able to understand the locals' conversations as I walked throughout the neighborhood. I was reminded of a month long visit to my family's ancestral villages near Guangzhou, China, where I was told I spoke like a native. (I think they were being kind to their American-born cousin.) Many staff in shops and restaurants in Chinatown here speak at least a little english but will readily slip into Toisanese or Cantonese Chinese speech dialects if you initiate the conversation. \n\nChinese have been historically adaptive and flexible in the US, as are most immigrant groups. The proliferation of Chinatowns in the U.S., at the turn of the century, can attest to that. I am so proud of, and grateful for, the Chinese immigrants before me, who braved incredible hardships to establish this haven of southern Chinese culture. \n\nNOTE: Additional photos of this incredible Chinatown, including videos and snapshots taken during the March 7, 2015 Chinese New Year Parade, are imbedded in the Yelp business photos section.\n\nPS: Be sure to see the authentic Chinatown gate at Grant Ave. and Bush Street, significant because it was built according to the dictates of traditional entry gate construction in China.\n\nChinese Historical Society of America:\nhttp://chsa.org/ \n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinatown/resourceguide/story.html", "author": "Shal W."}

I grew up with my parents taking us to various Chinatown all over the US-but it has probably been 7 years since I have last visited this particular one in SF. I honestly do think it is one of the best in the US, top 3 in my opinion. It's larger than most, and although modernization has occurred over the years and generations have become more Americanized, this little American slice of China remains roughly unchanged. While in town for the weekend I managed to make 3 trips to Chinatown, one to eat lunch (Kam Po), one to browse the shops, and one to stand in a very long line Sunday morning for Chinese bakery goods (Good Mong Kok). Although some may cringe at the smell of dirty streets and sewers and raw fish from the markets, this is an environment I am very comfortable in, and love to visit when I am in town.\n\nOn an emotional note, my grandmothers have recently passed. Walking the streets of SF Chinatown takes me to a place of my childhood and adolescence when I would do the weekend grocery shopping with my popo in Honolulu's Chinatown, and I have been to the SF one with her as well. This bit of nostalgia takes me right back to when they were here with me, and for that, I am entirely thankful.

At least make your way to the entrance gates and snap a pic for your digital photo album. \n\nIf you've ever been to Chinatown in other major U.S. cities (e.g., New York, Chicago) it's about the same, so you kind of know what to expect. SF's Chinatown reportedly houses the largest Chinese population outside of China so it is much larger, the streets are crowded with tourists and locals, and there are tons and tons of shops that pretty much all carry the same items; however, prices do vary vastly. Whether you're looking for higher end sculptures or simple little imported trinkets such as Jade rings or fans, I suggest visiting the Bargain Bazaar located at 667 Grant Ave between Sacramento St & California St (corner store). They offer way better prices than stores right next door or across the street and have 3 full levels of goods to choose from. \n\nAs would be expected, SF's Chinatown also has many authentic Chinese dining options from somewhat upscale and $$$ (e.g., try the famous Fried Crab at R&G) to some quick, and inexpensive Dim Sum at $ (e.g., Yummy Dim Sum). If you want the most authentic Chinese food at the best price, walk a street or two above the main drag...just be forewarned that the people in these establishments may not speak English well, but most do have English menus.  \n\nLastly, take advantage of the many foot message places scattered throughout Chinatown. After walking the soles of your shoes in SF, a good reflexology session will do you wonders and most of the places are super affordable (e.g., for both quality service and fair price I like Lucky Foot Massage / Health Center Massage).  \n\nIf you are a tourist and are staying several days, you will probably find yourself visiting Chinatown more than once. If not for the food, than to purchase something for that one person you seemed to have forgotten on you first trip. W\u00e1n d\u00e9 k\u0101ix\u012bn!", "author": "Dawn H."}

I wouldn't go as far as saying it resembles buildings from the long gone \"Walled City\" but you'll see some structural similarities to some of the living quarters you'd probably find in urban China.\n\nThere are shops that sell everything from produce and food, antiques, swords, cutlery, several Asian cultural items, clothing, incense, etc., etc.   Basically everything.\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is here and is a main attraction but pretty much no matter what time you go, it's packed with about a 30+ minute wait.  On a Sunday, I walked past it around noon and it had a long line. After touring town and coming back around 3:00PM, the line was even longer.  If I hadn't been hard-pressed for time I would have waited but I had to skip it.

I'm afraid, though, that I would just get sad about all the stuff I would see.  Chinatown's kinda like that:  You want to see it even though you really don't.  The alleys are all really neat, although there are way too many non-homeless middle-aged men peeing in public for no good reason.\n\nItalian food is always good in Chinatown.  Chinese food is usually good in Chinatown.

Whether you're a tourist, or a local, a lot can be loved about this place.\n\nNOTES:\n~ I would actually separate Chinatown in half - there is the tourist-friendly street, Grant, that is a lot more well-kept and more catered to tourists than locals. Here, you'll find souvenir and antique shops, old men playing the er-hu, and more tea-tasting stores than I can count. Stockton street though is where you'll find a much more \"raw\" Chinatown experience that is catered more towards the locals to the point where you may even struggle to find English speakers here.

As for the food I really have only ate at the empress of China, which has close wish I would have known so I could has seen it one last time, the place was like going in a old school Chinese restaurant.

No matter how many times I come here, there is always something new to discover.  \n\nSF Chinatown has got to be one of the best \"CHINA\" town in the world and I've been to many!  Maybe it's because the businesses are tightly packed and the street are not as wide as they are in NY and Los Angeles.  Maybe the little alleys with the local MOM & POPS businesses make it feel more \"homey\" like that cute little FORTUNE COOKIE FACTORY that's probably been there since the turn of the Century (feels like it anyhow)!   I love that place.  I've been buying my fortune cookies there since I was eight.\n\nThe best part about CHINATOWN today is that it has gotten a cool FACE LIFT over the years especially the upgrade of the parking garage off on Kearny Street with the park upstairs for kids to play too -- and the retired residents who vacates this place for Chinese Chess, they are so fun to watch!  How cool is that?  I get a kick coming here early in the morning to buy my congee (Chinese Rice Soup) during a weekend escapade from the Peninsula and I would sip my soup and watch the old ladies exercise their Tai Chi.\n\nOh BTW - my favorite time of the year to come to CHINATOWN is during their MOON CAKE FESTIVAL.

Traveling also gives me an appreciation that there a lot of sites to see that most people in the US don't have the capability to see. As my former boss said there are beautiful things to see in the US especially your own backyard. This week at work a colleague of mine who works at the Seattle office came to San Francisco to help implement new software program. As an appreciation I took her to Chinatown. I've been to Chinatown many times but that was only to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch. I never really explore it.\n\nOn Wednesday night after work we walked to Chinatown, which is about five blocks away from my work and is across the street from the hotel my colleague was staying. We walked though the main entrance on Grant Avenue. We explored certain craft stores. My colleague joked when we went inside these arts and crafts store that you want to buy things that are actually made in China. These \"Made in China\" items do attract tourists but also adds personality as they reflect a cultural identity. This cultural identity is why tourists and locals explore Chinatown. Besides walking on Grant Avenue we walked through small streets such as Spofford Street and Waverly Place. Even though there are restaurants all around Chinatown most of the restaurants that tourists go to are located on Jackson Street. (I had dinner that night in Chinatown at the oldest dim sum restaurant in the country Hang Ah Tea Room).\n\nSince we walked through Chinatown on a Wednesday night the area wasn't packed full of tourists. That was a benefit to us because we could take our time to relax and explore without feeling claustrophobic. As we explored Chinatown I began to have an appreciation that I took granted for. I have been traveling around the world to explore sites that people don't have the opportunity to see that I neglected to realize the sites that are in my own backyard that tourists come to visit. Chinatown is one of those sites. As I walked through Chinatown I began to realize why it's considered the biggest Chinese community outside of Asia. It is one thing to read history, but it's another thing experience history. Exploring Chinatown you get to walk and see the oldest Chinatown in North America. Certain streets such as Spofford Street and Waverly Place have charm because they feel old as if you were walking in the 1850s or 1880s. \n\nSince I work in San Francisco I have an appreciation how tourists come to visit to see and explore sites. However I never took the opportunity to explore certain sites such as Chinatown. It took an outsider to come to San Francisco for me to go to Chinatown. Thank you Lauren for not only coming to San Francisco implement the new software at work but also making me appreciate that there are great places to see in my own backyard.", "author": "Gerald R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-12", "description": "Bottom Line:  Chinatown is a must see for visitors to San Francisco but the best way to experience Chinatown is through a walking tour.  If you think Chinatown is just junk for sale, then I think you've missed the boat.\n\nConsider this:\n\nIf you stroll through Chinatown you can snap a selfie in front of the Chinatown gate, admire the ornate Chinese lanterns overhead and marvel at many touristy shops selling stuff from China.  That can be an entertaining experience, but, consider this . . .\n\nIf you take a guided walking tour of Chinatown you will travel back to the 1850s and learn how Chinatown came to be what it is today.  You'll gain an appreciation for the discrimination Chinese immigrants encountered in San Francisco and how they transcended racism to thrive in this unique neighborhood.  Your tour will take you off the beaten path where you will be mesmerized by pagoda-style architecture and perhaps dazzled by a tea or dim sum tasting.  But Chinatown is not all about colorful produce and vibrant art, so you will also learn about the opium related crime that plagued this neighborhood in the 1970s. Although all tours vary, you will probably stroll down Ross Alley for a fun photo op at the Fortune Cookie Factory.  \n\nIf you take a guided walking tour of Chinatown, instead of just departing Chinatown with some cheap souvenirs, you will leave with a deeper understanding and appreciation of this sub-culture.  I've been to Chinatown many times and it's most certainly the walking tour that made this a five star experience for me.  \n\nHere is some additional information about Chinatown that I hope you will find helpful:\n\n- My favorite souvenir shop in this neighborhood is Canton Bazaar.  They have two floors of goodies.  Be sure to check in on Yelp for a discount or to just negotiate prices anyway.  I spend so much time in this store that I usually have to take a bathroom break -ask for the key, the restroom is downstairs.  In addition to souvenirs, they have some great gifts and practical items too.  I am loving my new authentic chopsticks for Asian dinners at my house. \n \n- I also love the Fortune Cookie Factory on Ross Alley.  They do ask for a small donation ($0.25 I think) for photos and in exchange the gentlemen will smile in the background of your photo and give you a fortune cookie.   It can be a little tricky to find but definitely worth it.\n\n- If you love to cook or are a foodie, you will be fascinated by the produce stores.  Yes, they sell things other than bok choy!\n\n- Vegetarians might be horrified by naked ducks hanging in the storefront windows and live turtles swimming in tanks.  If you know which back door to knock on and speak Cantonese, you may be able to find some abalone or other interesting cuisine.  Wink.\n\n- My Chinese-American friend that lives in SF says the best Chinese food is actually near Golden Gate Park, not in Chinatown.  But, if you're not wanting to venture to that part of town, I can attest that I've had some yummy food in very authentic restaurants in Chinatown.\n\n-If you are lucky, a musician or two may be out on the street playing traditional Chinese instruments.  \n\n- Several companies offer walking tours.  Some might focus more on food or architecture but many hit all subjects at a high level.  Check Google or Yelp to find the perfect tour for you.", "author": "Courtney K."}

It's located near the city's downtown Financial District and covers over 20 hilly blocks.  Along with the Financial District, other surrounding neighborhoods include North Beach, Telegraph Hill, and Russian Hill.\n\nChinatown is mostly a tourist destination.  So, expect tourist traps in the form of restaurants and gift shops you'll come across.  Sure, you can find some decent Chinese food, markets, bakeries, and the like here, but you can find better versions elsewhere in the city and in the Bay Area in general.  If you're looking specifically for a neighborhood with good, authentic Chinese food, I recommend Clement Street in the Richmond District.  That's where you'll find the locals and not the tourists.\n\nChinatown is fun to walk around and explore.  The main gate is located at the intersection of Grant Ave. and Bush St. (the address for this business listing).  Grant Ave. is one of two major thoroughfares in Chinatown.  Stockton St. is the other.  Grant is more touristy than Stockton.  All over the neighborhood, you'll see old buildings with traditional Chinese architecture.  It's what gives Chinatown most of its character.\n\nIf you plan to drive to Chinatown, you can park in the garage located at Portsmouth Square.  Portsmouth Square is a small public park and often contains Chinese folks practicing tai chi and old men playing Chinese chess.  The square is also connected to the Hilton, which houses the Chinese Culture Center of San Francisco.", "author": "Daniel B."}

There is a mix of young and old, with colorful murals that illustrate the old days of railroad hardship and colonial ties. A majority of the many Chinese locals here are Cantonese speaking, and there are plenty of elderly folks walking the streets, hitting up the markets and manning the divey shops.\n\nIt must be me, but in terms of eats I've yet to find anything outside of Golden Gate Bakery to entice me to come here more often. The Canto contingent has been more concentrated in the Richmond area and regional Chinese spots seem scarce. Something tells me Ar-Yi and Ar-Po are busy cooking their market veggies and meats at home, unless they're just settling for mediocre Dim Sum and noodle joints.\n\nLike all large Chinatowns there is no shortage of touristy businesses aimed at providing an gimmicky experience, as opposed to cultivating and maintaing authenticity. It is by all accounts, a ghetto space that turns into a ghost town after 8pm.\n\nIn spite of all of this, I still make an effort to explore Chinatown whenever I'm back.

A true phenomenon, indeed!\n\nThe air permeates of Chinese BBQ'd meats, the decoration of brightly colored lanterns, the collective sound of Cantonese chatter, the wide open markets filled with unfamiliar roots, herbs, and vegetables, not to mention the old Chinese men who gather in one spot who spectate a rival of some sort of chess game; this here already qualifies it as a place all on its own.\n\nI, for one, have found great richness in the culture of Chinatown here in San Francisco. The people are functioning as it were in their homeland and it's truly a marvel to see. \n\nOh, and I can't discount the fact that everything is uber cheap here. As a fellow Asian, I love a deal whenever I can get one!\n\nA wonderful place to visit if you decide to tour! An absolute, true historical landmark here in this city!", "author": "Ann S."}

Everything is authentic Chinese and most of the people that own the shops don't even speak English. I really want to visit the country of China one day because of its rich history and culture. Walking through Chinatown in San Francisco really validated that interest. The food is amazing in San Francisco in general, but when you want some good Chinese food, you have to come to the source. You can also get pretty much anything you want in one of the shops, and you can even bargain with the owners.

This is something I've been doing for the past 24 years. Chinatown is a local flavor for which it is a spot attracting tourists from all around the world to come here. It seems to be more appropriate for the use of public transportation for convenience. There is something to be advised ahead of time, Chinatown can certainly be very crowded and parking is not always easy to find either!\n\nThere are plenty of restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores, and banks around here. A line-up of multiple businesses here representing San Francisco's Cultural Diversity. The banks here are listed as follows:\n\n--Wells Fargo Bank (2)\n--Bank of America (3)\n--JP Morgan Chase (2)\n--East West Bank (5)\n--Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation (1)\n--Bank of the Orient (1)\n\nMUNI routes 1, 8x, 10, 12, 30, & 45 provide service to and from Chinatown. Routes 10 & 12 now go through Chinatown together, they are also a much better option since they're not as crowded. On the other hand, routes 1, 8x, 30, & 45 are always crowded. These routes are so crowded that is making the operators and passengers very frustrated!

It seems like the top complaints that other Yelpers seem to have an issue with is: Chinatown is dirty, Chinatown has too many tourists, and the people in Chinatown don't know how to use crosswalks.\n\nFirst off, Chinatown is dirty. Yes, it freaking stinks, and I'm pretty sure the street cleaners don't come here often because it often smells like dank, garbage, and ass (not mine) With everyone hawking loogies, blowing snot rockets, and dumping unknown substances into the street, then I mean, what do you expect it to smell like? Flowers?! Secondly, yes there are tourists because it IS a tourist spot. If you don't like tourists, then come during the morning time. Thirdly, yes, it's true that people don't know how to use crosswalks. That, my friend, is the reason why you don't drive to Chinatown! There are plenty of other modes of transportation such as BART, MUNI etc and if you MUST drive, there's a nearby parking garage where you can park and conveniently walk to Chinatown.\n\nOther than that, Chinatown is a great place to get lost in for half a day (if you can bare the smell) There are plenty of things to see and great places to eat! You must visit Golden Gate Bakery and get some Dan Tat, visit the Fortune Cookie Company and purchase some yummy fortune cookies, and wander amongst the streets and alleys of good ol' Chinatown. 5 stars for me!", "author": "Joyce E."}

I rarely ever come on my own unless I'm required to. The only times you'll find me in Chinatown is if my parents are visiting me; then they would be the ones who would drag me there. \n\nChinatown is full Chinese people, duh. Let you on a little secret...I used to be scared of Asian people. Hahaha.. I'm serious! Growing up in a place where there's no other Asian people other than my family, I'm def not used to seeing Asians. So I used to be scared of Asian people whenever I visited SF back in the days. But now I def do not have the fear anymore since I've been living in the bay area for more than 5yrs now. \n\nSo what can you find in Chinatown... you can find lots of fruits & veggies, bbq items, pastries, clothing, dimsum places, and other random stores. \n\nAsian Pearl is the main dim sum place that we always frequent whenever we're there. It's alright. Service is so-so to sucky. Then usually we would hit up ABC for dinner. But our last experience there was not that great so I don't really care to go there anymore honestly.\n\nI do however like the decor especially of Grant Street. Very touristy, I know, but that's what makes it beautifully Oriental. I've once done a night photosession here & the pictures came out great since the decor was brightly colored. \n\nThere's like 3 different parking garages: Portsmouth, North Beach, & the other one right across from it. It's rare that you'll find a parking spot on the street plus i wouldn't trust parking on the streets of Chinatown anyways. Who knows what will happen to it or who does what to it? I've seen someone peed near a car once & that's just gross. So yeah, don't be stingy; just pay a few bucks to park in a garage. Much safer for you & your car!\n\nOh and watch out for silly pedestrians that think they always have the right of way even when the light clearly states that they are NOT meant to get on the walkway to get in front of cars!

Some of the buildings possess that certain element of years of charming wear and tear - don't seem very well-maintained.  They have um \"character?\"  All the different shops  are surely densely packed with cheap Chinese trinkets and the like, appealing to tourists.  \n\nOf course there is a large concentration of Asian food fare - probably all far more authentic than P.F.

I believe the first, but I think NY might be close in size too. SF Chinatown also beats LA Chinatown, hand downs. LA's Chinatown seemed completely dead and actually seemed to cater more toward Malaysia, Vietnamese, Thailand...etc, when I visited. \n\nThere are lots of very old architecture here too; like one of the shops we went into was actually a very old, run down theatre, and you couldn't tell unless you looked up at the ceiling and saw the loge balcony. Another was The Empress of China building; it screamed history all over it. I kept on being reminded of the Joy Luck Club wherever I turned.\n\nBecause SF Chinatown was probably one of the first to have existed in the states due to imported labor from the first city in China to open up (Hong Kong), it makes perfect sense that it's less Chinatown than it is Cantotown.  \n\nMost of the people here can speak Mandarin, but you will almost exclusively hear Cantonese. It freaked me out at first because I've never been to a concentrated area in America with so many Asians since New York or China, but I heard all different types of dialects. Here, it is almost exclusively Cantonese, and there were even a few situations where people didn't understand Mandarin!\n\nI can see myself buying groceries here if I lived in SF. Prices are cheap, produce is high qual, and it's always nice to grab a cheap snack or some dimsum before running more errands in the city. \n\nSo obviously go for the Cantonese restaurants, esp. the divey ones. They're the ones serving the best food. \n\nI've heard Grant is the more touristy of the streets, so Stockton might be more authentic (or at least slightly cheaper, because touristy places have a tendency of lower qual at higher prices). \n\nHmm....don't go to the Chinese Cultural Center. It's located in the Hilton (or was it something else?) Hotel on the 3rd floor or something like that. Complete waste of time- literally 4-6 pieces of work in a dead floor. \n\nMost of the shops here have comparable items and prices. One that stood out for me was China Bazaar; goods were very similar, but cheaper, and takes credit cards. \n\nI would estimate most of the places here are cash only as well.

The streets are one car wide and there are houses built upon houses. It's kinda like the Asian equivalent of the French Quarter in New Orleans.\n\nThere's the general cheapo stores that are so prevalent in LA's Chinatown, but there also so much more, including a lot of legit restaurants and shops. Basically any restaurant there is gonna be run by people who seriously know how to cook. We saw a group of older men playing these odd-looking instruments on the sidewalk, which sounded really neat. There was at least one place where they had people who could write your name on a grain of rice and put it in a water-filled tube on a chain for you to wear. Other places could write your name in beautifully flowing calligraphy on parchment.\n\nChinatown's also a good place just to walk around and soak it in.

Settled and established by the early immigrants from the Canton (Guangzhou) region of China, Chinatown now encompasses the new immigrants including those from Hong Kong and Mainland China.  Though still mainly Cantonese and its various dialects are spoken in Chinatown, there are now the various dialects of Mandarin that have become common to the community as well.\n\nThe two major Chinatown streets running south to north are Grant Ave and Stockton St, each with a different vibe and feel.  Grant Ave. starts at Bush St. at the \"Chinatown Gate.\" Grant Ave caters more to the tourists with its shops mainly selling arts and craft and souvenirs.  Stockton St. is where the Chinese community comes to shop and eat.  Stores selling daily staples, dry and can goods, fresh vegetables, meat and poultry, live seafood and deli.  There are new Chinatowns out in the western side of the City, on Clement St in the Richmond District and Irving St. in the Sunset District serving the residents that have moved into those Districts.  Yet many residents still venture back into Chinatown to do their shopping.  Late in the afternoon, they are carrying their shopping bags onto to the 30 Stockton bus on their way back home. \n\nFor those looking for dining establishments, there are restaurants, bakeries and take-out dim sum establishments located throughout Chinatown.  The Cable Car Museum is located here as well as the Chinese Historical Society of America Museum.  Parking lots are located in Portsmouth Square and two structures on Vallejo St.\n\nFor many, they will have either a love/hate relationship with Chinatown with its touristy side on Grant Ave. and the dynamic, busy atmosphere on Stockton St. where the residents come to eat and shop for the groceries.", "author": "Al L."}

Lots of stores with your cheap souvenirs and most importantly, a lot of good food.  It will range from sit down restaurants to quick to-go places.  For quick snacks, every block most likely has a to-go dim sum spot.  Grab your favorite dish for about $3 and chow.  A popular restaurant is House of Nanking but plan accordingly because it gets packed.  There are a handful of parking lots/structures but I recommend the portsmouth garage.  It's central and the easiest to get to, and is the most likely to always have spots.  It's probably the costliest though so if you're looking for a saving, try 343 sansome street.  $6 for 6 hours of parking, but it's a really small garage and super tight fits!

I get off at Powell BART, walk through Union Square to Chinatown, move onwards through North Beach and on to the Fisherman's Wharf/Ghirardelli Square Area, enjoy an Irish Coffee or ice cream, and then take the Hyde Street Cable Car back (with at stop at  Lombard Street).\n\n- Riding the 30 Stockton Bus!\n\n- Walking through the Dragon Gate (on Grant), but first stopping at St. Mary's, the adjacent square that includes a memorial to Chinese war veterans, and the Church's gift shop.\n\n- Breathing in the smells and energy of the Stockton street market scene.\n\n- Being taken to Lunch in Chinatown for Lunch by my Landlord. I could never find this place again on my own, and I was certainly in the minority. And I took his advice and avoided the thousand year-old soup dish.\n\n- Watching the Chinese New Year Parade (in the rain of course).\n\n- Attending Kung Pao Kosher Comedy at the New Asia Restaurant. And did you know that observant Jews have a separate set of dishes for Chinese?\n\n- Going to Dinner years ago with an Orthodox friend of mine. At that time, 2 of the very few Kosher restaurants in SF were in Chinatown.\n\n- Hanging out in Portsmouth Square (Chinatown's Livingroom) and watching many of the SRO occupants playing chess and practicing their Tai Chi.\n\n- Taking a guided walking tour and exploring the history of Chinatown via the alleyways.\n\nI'm sure that more pleasurable experiences will be forthcoming.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-07", "description": "So this is going to be a bit of a rant but after reading some of the reviews I gotta tell it how it is.\n\nYes Chinatown is dirty. But this is not some inherent quality of Chinese people or anything like that, it's because most of the people who live in Chinatown are desperately poor. And when you're poor and living in an overcrowded area things are going to be dirty. So if you're going to complain about the dirt check your privilege and understand that no one lives in a dirty neighborhood like that by choice, it's just what happens when you're new to this country and can't afford to move to the suburbs. And yes it is a little bit like China but that should come as no surprise because China is an overcrowded country with predominantly poor residents.\n\nI am someone who fondly remembers regularly going to Chinatown as a child with my grandmother to buy groceries.  This place, although a tourist attraction for some inexplicable reason, matters for the people that live there and the cultural history of San Francisco as a whole. Many of you may not know that the beginnings of Chinatown wasn't necessarily a place Chinese people created by choice - it was that no one would rent to them and they were forced to settle in the slums. Or that the pagodas,  the \"chinese architecture\",  were made solely for the benefit of tourists in the wake of the 1906 earthquake to allow Chinatown to stay where it was since the city wanted to move all off them out of what was potentially prime real estate.\n\nChinatown has a lot of history for my family and many others and has been and will be a port of entry for many poor immigrants. So when you complain about the dirt and give it one star reviews, understand that the laptop you're writing off of in the comfort of your house is a world away from what most residents of Chinatown have ever experienced.\n\nEnjoy the food, buy the knick knacks, and please keep spending your money there but be polite because Chinatown is more than just a tourist attraction, it's a community. Chinatown does not exist for the benefit of tourists but for the benefit of it's residents and the wider community.\n\nEnd Rant.", "author": "Misha T."}

Great for gift shopping for yourself and others. Bargains are always found and you can negotiate prices on anything, you don't have to pay what it says. Most venders will bargain with you or at the very least not charge you tax or take a buck or two off. If you are buying in quantity you can always get a great deal the more you buy the more they discount it. The bakeries and markets over on the side streets and one block over are always good too. Most of the places off the strip here don't speak english very well, if at all, but they do their best. If it is a massage place or something like that some of the markets and bakeries though don't care or need your business and can sometimes ignore you. But I used to think they were just rude but I think they just don't want to have to deal with you and those good bakeries are busy so if you cannot point or tell them what you want you may get frustrated. It has happened to me but if you stay on the main drag there are a few bakeries there and they have things marked in english pretty good unlike the other ones. Lots of good finds here and food galore, get a reflexology foot massage for $20 for 30 min too they are fabulous! Just look down the side streets they are usually right off the strip 1/4 block or so you can see the signs. Enjoy your trip to the city and come here for sure it is a great place to take a walk down and allow some time if you are looking to eat some good food and shop as well and then get that foot massage on the way out.

Im half Chinese. Theirs two sides of Chinatown, Grant Street which is basically dedicated to tourists and Stockton Street which is where the locals are and all the small cheap dim sum places and bakeries. If your looking for small souvenirs go onto Grant Street. They got cheap T Shirts, Key Chain, and you name it. Way cheaper than Pier 39 and SF Downtown. \n\nChinatown really resembles China. Take a walk down the alleys. Make sure your with someone though. And just look around, it looks EXACTLY like China (Yes I been there). \n\n\nSome useful tips: \n\nDont drive. Take the bus. Especially in Chinatown, your NEVER going to find parking. Your better off walking from Market Street/Grant Street and just walk straight up Grant. Its a 10 minute walk. But it will save you money and time. Ask anyone living in San Francisco, dont drive. Even when your walking around Chinatown the people that live their dont drive. \n\nBring Cash, most of the shops on Grant dont take credit cards. Especially since everything they are selling is super cheap. So bring CASH! (Im sure some places do but for the most part, they only take cash..)\n\nKnow how to use Chopsticks.

The shady alleys are an adventure to find, my favorite is Dumcombe Alley, home of the opium den. \n\nDuncombe Alley (Jackson and Grant) \n\nDuncombe Alley is located almost directly across from Ross Alley (famous for gambling and brothels) causing me to believe this little city block was once one hot bed of illegal activity. Duncombe Alley was once the center of the great opium trade and where the poor and middle class went to get high in Chinatown. Opium dens started to pop up in the 1850s and spread to the non-Chinese San Francisco population within 20 years. In 1878 San Francisco passed its 1st anti-opium ordinance and in 1913 opium became illegal. Most opium dens had cover up store fronts with a tightly sealed basement or backroom for smoking. \n\nThe alley is just as shady as ever. The sign is hidden in the shadows and is faintly highlighted by a depressing neon green sign. The lighting and fact that the alley can only be accessed by a metal fence with a deadbolt lined with barbed wire leads me to believe a little opium is still being smoked. \n\nWe stopped at a bunch of other locations on my tour, Ross Alley, Joice Alley, Imperial Palace Restaurant.......", "author": "Alice S."}

Keep in mind that in China thats acceptable.  So in actuality, you are pretty much as close to China as possible, here on this side of the Ocean.  \n\nSo my only advice to vistors, is to avoid the the superficiality of the souverior shops of Grant Ave, and venture towards Ross Alley, Waverly Street, and Spotford Alley.", "author": "Cass J."}

My grandfather owned the first chinese-owned gas station (Shell) in chinatown (it is now demolished) and he also worked at the piers and built submarines. One of my great-great uncles was the first chinese person to own a house in SF.    My great-grandfather was murdered on Grant Street in chinatown in the early 1900's - it was a case of mistaken identity.   Of course it wasn't taken to the police.  Back in those days, chinatown was strictly segregated from the rest of SF, a city within a city.\n\nMy dad was born in chinatown and still knows all the streets and alleyways like the back of his hand.  My brother and I are in our thirties and we still get nervous and stay close to his heels as Dad leads us through his crazy shortcuts.  Aside from the cheesy tourist shops laden with some of the most offensive stereotypical souvenirs you can imagine, there are some real bargains and finds here; Affordable and delicious food, intricate gold jewelry with amazing craftmanship, fantastic imported items from asia, Sanrio and Sanrio knockoffs galore.  There is still a real sense of community here.\n\nAlthough I often detest chinatown with it's fishy smells and the shoving, pushing, and yelling, it is a part of my  heritage and this is where I'm from. For that I can't help but feel a sense of pride as I walk through the streets, making sure the hems of my pants don't touch the filthy sidewalk.", "author": "Courtney Y."}

And they were great.  They all showered me with food, which is always the best way to bribe me into giving your kid \"special treatment.\" \r\n\r\nBut it was Christmas when I raked up the schwag, and this year most of my stuff came from Chinatown shops.  Chinese bakery cakes, cookies, fruit, char si bau, platters of those greasy-ass sesame balls, See's candies (crosses all borders) and the occasional gift certificate.  I was stoked!  \r\n\r\nIn the morning, one of my favorite little girls came up to me as I was taking attendance and handed me a pretty red box with a big pink bow.  I gave her my shocked and surprised face, hugged her and thanked her profusely, swearing I would cherish it forever.  \r\n\r\n\"Will you wear it?\"  She whispered bashfully into my ear. \"Mommy let me pick it out in the store...\"\r\n\r\nShe was staring at me with big, Bambi eyes and looking insecure about her present.  It was heartbreaking, so I decided to act like she'd just given me an Elizabeth Taylor sized diamond...or a crate of Yoo-Hoo.   \"Wear it?\"  I whispered back with great enthusiasm.  \"Only EVERY DAY!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the kids evacuated the room to go home, I greedily opened all of my loot.  I rejoiced in all of the goodies I was going to be gorging myself on for the next three hours (before hubby came to pick me up...I don't like sharing.)  All that was left was that pretty red box with the big pink bow.  I casually ripped the paper open and stuck my hand in the box.\r\n\r\nSomething...polyester...and itchy...with an obscene amount of sequins was in there.  Dread suddenly filled me as I finally pulled out the gift the little cutie had tried so hard to find, just for her teacher....the gift I swore to this big Bambi-eyed kid I would wear faithfully...EVERY DAY, and for God knows how long!  \r\n\r\nShe was in Kindergarten, so that would be...4 more years until she'd be out of Elementary school?!  \"Muthafu#%ing, big-mouth, dumbsh%#t, assh!$le, dip-sh%#t, pin-head,  lame-brain, idiot, moron\" quickly flowed through my head.\r\n\r\nIt was a bolero cut, tight as Hell, hoochie mama top made out of some mystery material apparently engineered to cause severe itching.  Size 2.  When I tried it on I looked like a Solid Gold Dancer reject....a deranged Rick James impersonator!  I looked at myself in horror and thought, \r\n\r\n\"Holy Christ, I can't wear this in public!\"  I was already humiliated at school once that year in a dodgeball/krunking incident...I really would rather not talk about it...\r\n\r\nMy husband ruptured a blood vessel in his forehead from laughing so hard when he saw me in it.  I, in turn, fractured my hand from beating him repeatedly until he passed out.\r\n\r\nI wore the friggin' thing to school the first day back from Winter Break.  The kids were impressed with the sparkly gold material and grabbed my boobs all day long trying to get their hands on the little shiny sequins.  Bambi Eyes looked happiest of all.  She beamed a smile that made me wish I had matching kick-pleat pants to go with it.  After that, I didn't mind the stares of disgust, the insidious laughter, or the nasty rash I contracted from the scratching.\r\n\r\nThe next weekend, I was walking in Chinatown with my husband, looking for Dim Sum when a shiny glare hit my eyes, blinding me momentarily.  When I regained my sight, I looked up into the store window in front of us.  There, hanging on a satin hanger, was my Solid Gold Dancer uniform.   AND you had your choice of either matching hot pants or lovely leisure slacks to complete your ensemble.\r\n\r\nHubby looked at the pants.  Then looked at me.  Then looked at the pants.  Ran into the store.  And BOUGHT me the rest of that wretched outfit...\r\n\r\n...and I look HOT.", "author": "Kristina R."}

That being said, you should know that....\n\nSan Francisco's Chinatown is a POSER. \nThat's right. I said it. A POSER.\n\nBut Andrew! What?.. Why do you say that?...\n\nI say that because before the Great Quake of 1906, San Francisco's Chinatown was quite different and the current \"Chinatown\" was planned and placed to be the tourist attraction it is today.\n\nIn Victorian times (pre-quake) Chinatown was a little more northwest and was simply an area where Chinese-American Immigrants lived in mass. Land ownership for Chinese men was sparse and limited to the wealthy few. In fact, there was a lot of xenophobia towards the area. Attitudes might be equated to modern popular sentiment towards shanty-towns and hobo villages.\n\nFor the white folk, Chinese-American Immigrants were barbaric, exotic and the sight-to-see. It used to be the thing to do to have a guided tour through the streets to watch these 'savages' live, talk, interact, etc. It was considered a great scare for the women folk and a penis contest for the men... Oh, an adventure to visit Chinatown... The initial 'tourist attraction' was more like exploitation. \n\nAfter the quake, politicians were eager to recreate (at a larger scale) the tourist attractions of San Francisco to bring people back. One being Chinatown. A location was chosen from the rubble to be redeveloped  (Ever wonder why there's a very Catholic church smack dab in the center of Chinatown?)... From there, architecture from buildings to lamp posts were designed to emulate \"oriental/Asiatic\" designs. And VOILA! You have San Francisco Chinatown.\n\nWhat we have now is a neat staple in the city. It continues to thrive as a diaspora for Chinese-Americans, and I love dim sum! But there's a lot of really neat history behind the area that a lot of people don't know! It would be better if there was a way to integrate educational tools into the area. \n\nI'm also one for closing the street off and turning the area into a pedestrian way! \n\nThe end.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Or, perhaps, it was nothing more than my family's yen for Chinese food.\n\nNevertheless, my dad, a true aficionado of spicy Chinese food (and probably the women too, truth be told) took us kids into the bowels of Chinatown often. So often that we were masters of \"chopstick-do\" long before we could use a fork \"European style\". We lived off Green Street back then and whenever dad got the hankering (he really liked to hanker a lot and they didn't call him \"Terrible Teddy\" for nothing), it was off to Chinatown.

It didn't matter a whit that we had to tussle and fight for a seat in some of the joints, or even speak Chinese. We were just happy in our \"second Shanghai\" search for the best of Chinese chow.

On one hand, it's one of the richest places in America where you can experience Chinese American culture, through food, history, and even grocery shopping.  On the other hand, Chinatown is a ghetto.\n\nOn several occasions, I've visited relatives of friends in Chinatown.  What a lot of people don't see are the living conditions in some of these buildings, two or three bathrooms that are meant to serve an entire floor of tenants, the smell of urine in the hallways, rusted pipes, like ivy, climbing the walls between buildings.\n\nOf course, living in an ethnic enclave has its upsides as well as its downsides.  For many this is a place of community where you don't have to speak English to find work but few have the luxury of social mobility.\n\nI'd like to think it's changing.  In New York, for instance, Chinatown is actually one of the hip places to live these days.  But go north of the border into Canada, and you see an entirely different kind of Chinatown with modern buildings, bustling commerce, and spotless facilities more reflective of modern Asian life in cities such as Hong Kong.\n\nOf course, there's nostalgia.  Having dim sum with my family, picking  up fresh fish and vegetables at various markets, are memories that will stay with me forever.

I'm down with the peoples in the old Chinatown!\n\nSF Chinatown is unique in the Americas because of the proximity to China. It has a flavor and history unlike any other place, Asia or otherwise. In fact, Chinatown has become much smaller than it was. Recent government/private sector scams have displaced a good portion of the population. Chinatown survives!\n\nI wish every borough of SF had a parking garage. Chinatown parks!\n\nReal food from real cooks almost 24/7. It's not as good as a lot of stuff I've had in China or a Chinese home but it kicks PF Changs janky ass. Chinatown eats!\n\nMy mom goes to Chinatown to get all of her herbs. Chinatown heals!\n\nThere are at least 5 great small bars in the area. Some hole in the wall, some gangster, some yuppie. Chinatown drinks!... a lot\n\nUnlike Clement, the real Chinatown has kept alive a sense of unity, community, and immigrant pride. Banks, schools, and a plethora of community help organizations tell the residents and visitors alike that the people of China are here to thrive in a land that does not always treat them as valued citizens. The Chinatown YMCA is world famous for the involvement it has with the people. A model studied by various organizations to be duplicated. Chinatown lives!\n\nBesides...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-25", "description": "I guess living in LA gave me high expectations for what I think a Chinatown should be.  A place to buy cheap goods (aka knockoffs) at cheap prices that you wheel and deal for.  Not the case at SF's Chinatown.  Sure it's larger than LA's but it's just more of the same shop over and over and over again.  It does have a large market district which was crazy busy with a lot of locals when we went so if we lived locally I could see that as a plus.  We didn't try the restaurants while there but did try a couple boba shops and those were AMAZING!!  The people were friendlier and less pushy to sell than the shops in LA but no one would haggle prices with you and every store on every block had the same prices.  Also, though we found places that would sell you boba/bubble tea/tapioca drinks NO ONE sold the actual tapioca/boba balls.  That was a bit disappointing to me along with the high prices of everything.  I'm thinking this Chinatown knows they are a tourist destination so therefore charges for it but again just wasn't what I was expecting.  The building themselves and the experience make it worth it for any first time travelers to the area but if you've seen it once then you've seen it plenty.  One tip I'll pass along is bring cash and change and know your math as not every shop has a cash register and some of the employee's change giving skills were not up to par.", "author": "Nicole M."}

The streets are crowded, the food is greasy, everything smells bad, there is always some strange liquid spewing into the street. My standard response when my friends tell me they're going to Chinatown? Watch out for SARS!\n\n\n Perhaps because it's always been there. It was one of the first places in San Francisco I'd ever visited. I didn't know the history, nor did I really even care. It's gross and why don't these people move faster! was my main concern. All kidding aside, I grew up in a hispanic suburb south of San Diego. I've never really felt close to the Chinese community since I never really had one around me. Stories of those Chinese immigrants involving railroads and Angel Island were as foreign to me as my slanted eyes were to everyone else.\n\n\n I never knew that my Dad had never been to Chinatown either. He was up here in the Bay Area because of my college graduation, so things were already a little bit emo. We were walking around, and on Stockton and Jackson, he stopped. In Mandarin, he tells me a story.\n\n\n When I was young, your grandfather and grandmother would always talk about Old Gold Mountain [San Francisco's name, in Mandarin]. We had many friends who would sneak onto boats in the hopes of arriving here. Many of them never made it to Old Gold Mountain. But when they did, all they could speak of was the strength of the Chinese community and all the hopes and dreams of the Chinese in America.\n\n\n The 30 Stockton rumbles by, the street shakes a little, as does my Dad's voice.\n\n\n 60 years later, I am here for the first time. I am old, my accomplishments in life are limited. But you, you live here now. And for you, it's been so easy. But in these streets, you can feel history. You can feel my story, your grandfather's story, your grandmother's story, your mother's story. To you, it is just some street in San Francisco. To us, it is the reason we are all here, celebrating you and your sister. To us, it is the reason why so many of us came to America, why we always pressure you to succeed.

You'll either love it or hate it. Take your pick. You have a couple of options, as well, as to how dirty you want to get. Stockton St. is, by far, the dirtiest because of all the foot traffic. Grant St. is not as congested but beware of the tourist trap shops that aren't even Chinese owned. You'll know which ones I'm talking about. And Powell St. is like the new kid on the block. Very quiet and light on traffic. Maybe it has something to do with the cable car line...\n\nThere's plenty to see and learn in Chinatown. Some will come to you and some you will need help and guidance to learning. Like self defense against the elderly. They may look old but they can kick you ass getting on the bus and getting to and from where they want to go. Best stay out of the way. And taking pictures of the meat products in various states of animation. Fish in a Styrofoam box with enough water to breath versus the live fish in a tank. Poultry in a cage versus poultry in a bag in the cooler. Yeah, that's what's for dinner tonight.\n\nAnd if you can get over the stench and dirtiness of the place, you can try to venture into a hole in the wall restaurant and try ordering some food. Kinda adventurous that way. Or you can cave in and dine at one of the many brightly lit restaurants that try to suck up to the tourists with their fake smiles.

They had made the mistake of thinking that they could ship this recently widowed woman and her six kids back to China. \nIt is this kind of tough as nails tenacity that reminds me of any Chinatown community, one that is a whole community of it's own, where for many is their only world.  Barely surviving after the freeway closures from the Loma-Prieta earthquake, and the plague of gentrification that affects so many communities in urban cities, it continues in it's metamorphosis.  \nHang Ah tea room is where my family would gather when we came in from 'Yee Fow'.  Amazing that it's been here for so long and is still getting decent reviews.  After that, we would get a duck to bring back home and go to Eastern Bakery for a slice of Coffee Crunch Cake, or pick up a Chinese Apple Pie at Ping Yuen Bakery. Yang Sing only had one restaurant on Broadway and the prices were actually reasonable.  Some people preferred the Orange or Custard pie at Sun Wah Que or Uncle's Cafe.  Sadly Edsel Ford Fong is no longer around to insult you and stick his thumbs in your jook at Sam Wo, but his name lives on at AT&T Park.  \nJoe Fong, of the 'Joe Boys' Chinatown gang infamy, is now a professor in the Ethnic Studies department at College of San Mateo.  The Holiday Inn is now a Hilton.  The new International Hotel was finally completed in 2005, replacing the hole in the ground that was left after the original was demolished after the elderly tenants were evicted, beginning  what would become a nearly 40 year battle to provide affordable housing.\nMuch has changed. So if one of those little old ladies almost knocks you over to board the #30 Stockton, think of my Grandmother and offer her your seat.  She has had a long struggle.", "author": "Arlene C."}

I feel happy with the fact that I can say I wandered around those parts.\nI even ate in these parts. Now I was unfortunately strapped for cash so I settled for this small buffet spot.

It did \"feel\" a little more authentic though, what with the grimy cafeteria style dining area, atrocious bathroom and pigeon walking around the floor.

I like to go get star paper because it's cheaper then japantown and other places. They always have good food, but I have germphobia. I'm gay. ._________. I'm always scared to touch things, so that doesn't work for me. And everytime I go it's always like a fair going on, a fair here a fair there. or just like \"lemonade\" stands that sells jade and etc. Cool right? lolol.I like banh uot NOT FROM THERE. I like boba, from chinatown, and egg custards. ^_______^V I shall go to yelp the egg custard place now. ahhaa. enjoy chinatown. :] btw, people are pushy becareful.\nOh last thing, if you decide you need to get to the other side of the street and you are being pushed DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T run in the middle of the street if you see a bus, THEY DON'T CARE AND WILL JUST SPEED UP.

Its pretty big but I've only been to Seattle and Honolulu's Chinatown so I don't know how it is in bigger places.  Its a lot more decorative and it has one main strip.  There are also lots of dim sum restaurants and souvenir shops.  I actually looked for the cheapest bargains available and while the souvenir shops were selling the same items, some are more expensive than others so watch out.  The quality isn't that great though.  I bought a mug and the ink started fading.  There were also pillow covers that started falling apart.  So lesson one is don't buy cheap crap in chinatown cause they fall apart easily.   I found there are Americanized dim sum restaurants so if you want the authentic ones avoid the financial district.", "author": "Leo M."}

There's a wide variety of cheap groceries .. anything from fish to canned foods to meat to veggies to frozen foods . There's a few shops that sell Asian tea which comes in loose tea leaf .. good for you tea lovers out there ;) . They also sell soda , Asian beverages , and Asian snacks . There's some boutiques as well that sell some pretty unique stuff . I only shop at one boutique in Chinatown and it's my favorite boutique . Lots of cute and trendy clothing =] . Sorry , I'm just more of a boutique person . I hate mainstream clothing . I barely ever shop at corporate stores . And no , I'm not going to tell you guys which boutique it is is .. don't want all you going there or else there would be no more cute sexy clothes left for me hehe ;) .  There's also a cosmetic store that sells interesting decent Asian skincare and makeup products . There's some spas too .. my favorite spa in Chinatown . I've been a good amount of spas but they give the best quality facial massages and facials at the best prices . There's 3 Bank of Americas , 1 Wells Fargo , and 1 Washington Mutual in Chinatown . There's LOTS AND LOTS of hair salons that will give cheap haircuts . There's 4 parks and a recreation center . There's LOTS AND LOTS of Chinese restaurants .. well duh - it's Chinatown !! Lastly , the reason why I LOVE Chinatown is because it's the only ghetto left in SF . Don't drive to Chinatown unless you're willing to pay for garage parking because there is NO PARKING in Chinatown .. there's just no room for it - the streets are too narrow . Don't take the bus through Chinatown .. it's just so packed that it's not even funny . You will get so frustrated taking the bus through Chinatown . Your best option would be to get off at North Beach and walk though Chinatown or get off at Downtown and walk through Chinatown . C'mon people .. stop being so lazy !! It's only a few blocks ! Another thing I don't like is Grant St - it's way too touristy . Don't even argue with me .. you all know it's true !!", "author": "Eileen L."}

So, we bought the toad. It was sold to us in a plastic bag which we filled up with water. Hero Helen and Sidekick Shari got back on muni and went back to Union Square to share the saved creature with my very important mother. \n It is clear that the next part of the story takes place inside of Saks 5th Avenue with a steaming mother an innocent group of superheroes and a very happy, slimy, living toad. I was banned from visiting my mother at work for a year.\n\nback to china town for a second. \n  the place looks like something out of  movie. people still dry their sheets out on clothes lines outside their windows, the crowds are monstrous, and the smell, OH THE SMELL....\n  great food, a must for tourists too see, and incredible back scratchers for $1\n:)", "author": "Helen N."}

Lee Po and the rest of the watering holes are excellent, as are all of the shops, Golden Gate Bakery, and markets for nicknack's and groceries.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-09", "description": "I am Chinese and I used to hate this place with a passion.  Maybe b/c I felt as if I was too good for it.  But after being exposed to it more and more, it felt comfortable going there.  I've been there as a kid every year and first couple of times was fun but afterwards, it got boring b/c it's all the same.  When I moved back to the Bay area, I rarely went there b/c it smelled, the people were rude, and quite frankly, I didn't think the food was any good.  Now, after some time and knowing where to go and what to buy, I started liking it because turns out that there are some things that you can get in Chinatown that you can't get elsewhere.  For example, you can't get any better egg tarts than Golden Gate Bakery, you can't get any better produce than at Chinatown, and you don't have old ladies cutting in front of you while you are waiting for a cashier anywhere else but in Chinatown.  If you like to cook and eat like me, I think the best place to buy asian fruits and vegetables is in Chinatown.  Just yesterday, fresh (not frozen) Longan's were only $1.09 a pound.  The only problem with Chinatown is the parking.  Either park in a garage or have patience when looking for a spot.  Don't forget to overfill your parking meter b/c the meter maids are out in full force over there.  Also, if you go after 3pm, expect not the best and sometimes dried vegetables b/c 1) the old ladies have already picked out the best ones or 2) they stores won't restock b/c it's late in the afternoon and they are about to close.  However, on the flip side, during the late afternoon they keep lowering their prices so they don't have to repack it and bring it back inside.  I think that's the same case with the chinese deli's too but I'm not too sure about that.", "author": "Benny M."}

Also some herbal stores, if you are into chinese medicine. I have no experience on that.
