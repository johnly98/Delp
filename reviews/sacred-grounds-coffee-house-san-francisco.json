I was drawn in from the milk bubble tea sign on the windows and decided to go in. The smell inside was a mixture of body odor and I don't know, spoiled food? It was confusing and I didn't like it, but I kept walking to the back counter anyway because I had to give this tea a try (and a chance). The man handling the orders and register wasn't exactly friendly but he wasn't mean either. He just didn't seem like he wanted to take my order. After placing, I probably waited 4 minutes until my bubble tea was ready. What a pleasure! It was great. The black tea had great, strong flavor and it was warm at first because he had just brewed the tea and it needed to be shaken a bit before it all became the same temperature. The boba was nice and chewy, not exactly fresh boba or homemade tasting, but still good and there were lots of it.\n\nI ended up getting the size large soy milk boba tea and it cost me $6 with a small tip. Comparatively to other boba places in the city, I thought it was a good size for the price. It was $4.50 for the large and an additional 0.40 cents for the soy milk plus tax. I don't know that I'll come back for anything other than the boba because I wouldn't want to eat inside the restaurant, but maybe I'd consider getting something to go.\n\n4 rating for the tea but a 2.5/3 for the restaurant because of the smell.", "author": "Bri T."}

If you've never been here before, make sure to watch your step when walking towards the counter! You order where the huge menu is. The owners are friendly and efficient--the mister always greets me, takes my order, and works his magic, sending me on my way in 10 minutes or less. Most often less. \nI highly recommend trying the \"fogs\" here if you haven't - my favorite is the London Fog, which is an earl grey tea latte. I can't say much about the food since I only tried their lox here and it was pretty good for the portion and price. My colleagues often purchase food here though and enjoy the sandwiches. \nRegular coffee comes in two options: French roast or dark roast. *They have a credit card usage for $5 minimum. If you're like me and don't normally have cash on you, add a cookie from the cookie jar ($1.95) and you'll be safe to use your card. \nPlenty of seating and some nice comfy sofas too.

I watched in horror as:\n\nFirst they took FROZEN cutlets of chicken, then they put it them in the same toaster they use for the bagels to heat it up. Next they microwaved the Oscar Mayer bacon. And then they toasted a hot dog bun. That's right it's served on a hot dog bun. Topping off this gross concoction was browned avocado, green tomato, yellow lettuce, onions, pickles, and your usual condiments.

I was by the Saint Mary's Hospital, was hungry, and decided to go in here for a shot. What stuck to me the most from this place was the London Fog.\n\nThe interior is very cute. In a way, it reminds me of a hostile or a rustic lodge. My only issue was that the door was left wide open, and it was not a warm day in SF today... That aside, I really love how it is inside. They even have a corkboard where people put their advertisement up! \n\nService was great! There were two workers, one male and one female. They were both very kind and patient when we seemed like we were taking forever to decide. There weren't a lot of people there, probably because it was early ... or because of other Yelp reviews ... Anyway, the food came out pretty fast. \n\nI ordered the Lox Bagel, which had cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, onions, and tomatoes. I actually didn't know that they had tomatoes ... I usually avoid that. My boyfriend ordered the egg and toast with an extra order of bacon. I thought it seemed kind of cheap that they did not include bacon, and that $1.50 is the price of two bacon strips ... Well, I couldn't find anything else opened at that hour! \nThe food was decent, not amazing, but not unbearable either. We also ordered two drinks: a white chocolate mocha and a London Fog. The London Fog was very impressive ... Usually, it tastes like Fruit Loops, and the Earl Grey is not so strong. Their Earl Grey is very strong, and I enjoyed that. I didn't try the White Mocha ... but I assumed it was good, seeing that my boyfriend drank it all. \n\nI might come back to this place again, perhaps for a sandwich if I am by the neighborhood.", "author": "Bianca W."}

At first, I didn't mind Sacred Grounds: it's pretty quiet, there's free (if terribly spotty) Wi-Fi, and (as I said) it's close to my bf's house. But subsequent visits revealed 1) really inconsistent quality of the coffee; and 2) dishonesty on the part of the staff. \n\nTo address point (1), I'll say that the coffee is average at best - nothing to write home about (esp. not in this city), but not terrible. Every so often, though, the coffee will just be shitty. I mean, really bad: weak, with bits of grounds in it. Yuck. Plus, the coffee is self-serve, which practice is a pet peeve of mine. \n\nConcerning point (2), let me relate the results of a longitudinal study I conducted over the course of three months. My favorite to-go breakfast from coffee/bagel shops is an everything bagel with light cream cheese. Notice that I did not say \"regular cream cheese,\" but rather \"light cream cheese.\" I'd been ordering this breakfast at Sacred Grounds for about a month when I got the hunch that the kitchen staff were just giving me regular cc, despite their acknowledgment of my order. The next few times I placed my order, I articulated the word \"LIGHT\" especially well (and always received a nod of agreement/acknowledgment/what have you from the clerk)...but the clerk never wrote \"light\" on the order slip. My experiment reached its conclusion when I finally witnessed a staff person smearing my bagel with regular cream cheese. Long (long) story short, the staff here are discourteous. It's like, if you don't have light cream cheese, just tell people that you don't have light cream cheese. Don't pretend that you do and slather on the regular stuff, capish? \n\nALSO, the owner(?)/older staff member once mis-rang my bf's order - he charged us for the drinks he said he \"forgot\" to include in the total - and was really surly when we questioned his math skills.

Local newspapers and fliers are everywhere and the eclectic decor isn't just for show, it's been slowly accumulated over time and if you notice it for too long, the regulars will walk up to you and share the history behind it with you. \n\nThe only problem with Sacred Grounds (a big one I'm afraid) is that the food is overpriced and sucks. I can't say anymore then that. I went in this morning for a latte, orange juice and two bagels. The latte was weak as water, the OJ was fine, but the bagels, I found out after I receive them, were left over from the day before. \n\nMy suggestion is that if you decide to go to study or meet up with friends, smuggle food in with you.", "author": "Michael A."}

The walls and floors sport wood paneling, there are many quiet conversations taking place, and the crowd holds customers from ages 18 to 70. Considering its location next to USF, students gravitate towards the small cafe as a place to study during the day, making use of the free Wi-Fi offered on behalf of the cafe. \n\n In a metaphorical sense though Sacred Grounds is much like a pinata that spits out one or two decently average pieces of candy, but nothing more. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served all day which is convenient but that fact serves little apology to your wallet and stomach.\n\n The majority of the menu is the sandwich list which offers single cold cuts starting around $6, burgers for $7, and the delicacy sandwiches(salmon or a rib eye steak) are $10. The list is lengthy but its length is its only ambition. \n \nA half and half combination of soup and sandwich($ 6.95) is the most economical lunch option. Limited to only turkey, ham, roast beef, pastrami, and a cheese toastie for the half the sandwich feels cheap and unsatisfying considering the quality of those choices. The turkey boasts less flavor than processed turkey found in an Oscar Meyer Lunchables pack, and the vegetables and condiments are not fresh enough to make that fact forgettable. The sourdough bread is over toasted , and thoughts like \"Why didn't I make a lunch?\" surface quickly. The half and half combination comes with a side of tortilla chips, if you want the home fries, which in actuality are microwaved cold roasted potatoes, enjoy having to fork over an additional $3.25, they do not come included.\n \nWhen it comes to soup (cup $3.75/bowl $4.75) choose carefully between the two daily offerings. Sacred Ground's vegetarian chili is savory and a good option for a cold day, but the clam chowder does no justification to the argument for West Coast chowder. It was thin, watery, and unfulfilling, after a couple of bites a companion dropped his spoon sadly giving up. \n \nThe three dinner entrees share similar problems with the lunch options. The salmon dinner($12) which is served with a side of caesar salad and home fries gives you exactly what you pay for. The salmon took over 20 minutes and upon delivery it was lukewarm . The outside felt rubbery and overcooked, and the inside was suspiciously pink, watery, and dull.  \n\n The dessert menu is small, but had some saving value. The carrot cake($3.75) is throughly layered with a thick vanilla cream cheese frosting that compliments the moist, smooth cake and excites taste buds.\n \nSacred Grounds does not fail as a coffee lounge, but it fails as an institution that promises a worth while meal. There is no wait staff, and do not be surprised if whoever is taking your order needs to come from behind the register to answer a question about their own menu. If you're in a rush try and avoid ordering anything you couldn't make at home, because the wait is long and unworthy of your time for the end result. In the end Sacred Grounds strives in atmosphere, but regrettably falls short of the  culinary cut.", "author": "Chris C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-12-14", "description": "I have been here twice and definitely won't make it three.  Let's put it this way: I was inspired to join Yelp just to warn people about this place.  Set the scene: Saturday morning, I'm new to the neighborhood and psyched to check out the local coffeeshop.  I ordered the tuna melt and a coffee, both of which were completely mediocre, so the lack of ambiance and consideration on the staff's part slightly soured the experience.........but whatever.  Maybe they were having a bad day.  So I decide to give it another shot the next weekend.  My friends and I order one latte and three bagels to go: one with cream cheese, one with cream cheese and veggies, and one with cream cheese, veggies, avocado, and turkey.  The tab comes out to be $23 and change, after the owner spent about half an hour ringing up all of the add-ons separately.  That seemed a bit steep (even for SF) so I asked him to double-check the bill, to which he snapped, \"It's $23.  Do you want to watch me while I ring it up a second time?\"  To which I said yes, although a bit embarrassing but $23 for 3 bagels and a latte?!?  Come on.  This time, after another agonizing process of $1.30 avocado charge here, $.50 tomato/$.50 onion/$.50 cucumber charge there etc, it comes out to $16 and change.  He gave us an extra $5 bill to try to make up for his previous rudeness when we requested that he double-check the bill.  \n\n...........................so, fast forward 15 minutes.  We're still waiting for our food, even though it's not busy at all.  When we ask him about the status, he replies with a REALLY sour attitude that they're working on it and that us standing around watching them isn't going to help the situation.  (even though that is not what we had been doing)  Unfortunately, this comment set my Latina girlfriend through the roof and it became quite heated in there for a minute.  She stormed out.  Finally, when the food was ready after about another 5 minutes, they hand me the bag.............but there's no latte.  \"I also had a latte,\" I say.  \"Oh, OK, what size?\" asks the girl behind the counter, as if this was the first she had heard of it.  Even this was a bit much for me.  I left.  But not without making them give me back the $2 for the latte.  \n\nObviously my second experience there was extremely uncomfortable, shattering the otherwise complete silence that was present in the dining area.  I don't like drama and try to steer clear of places that inspire me to create some.  It's sad but true that the closest place to my house sucks.  Oh well, it just gives me another excuse to go out and explore the neighborhood.\n\nps - I know this was such a rant, but I obviously needed to vent, so thanks for reading.", "author": "Kate B."}

Generally, it's pretty quiet and I like that people usually keep to themselves. It doesn't have the transient feel of a chain like Starbucks, which I like but these days is less a coffee shop and more of a stopover for people with busier destinations. At Sacred Grounds, folks still like to order their coffee and sit down with the paper, study, or conduct a low key conversation. It's a nice change of pace when it is busy, though, because a little place like this deserves the business. The staff is often super-friendly and they treat every customer with a very affable, personal approach. On one of my first visits, the background music consisted of Diana Krall, and I subsequently got into a fond chat about her with the gentleman behind the counter. The food is fantastic, something I would have never expected from a coffee house. I know that a lot of cafes these days are branching out into serving meals that are more than just sandwiches and pastries, but I've enjoyed many delicious breakfasts here.
