It's not huge, I mean it's at most 5 or 6 blocks but the quality of restaurants and local bodegas are awesome! A friend took me here the other day since we were in the neighborhood and recommended we stop here for happy hour. Well they have $1.50 oysters during HH and I'm NEVER saying no to that. \n\nSo normally, HH oysters anywhere else whatever the house has on stock. Any other specific oyster is  normal price. Red Hill is $1.50 on any of the oysters on their menu. This includes Kushi, Kumomoto and other beautiful seafood gems they have on stock. Yea.....that's unheard of! We ordered a dozen for sure! \n\nTurns out their menu is off the charts good! All their seafood items looked great such as the squid salad and the trout tartare! We made friends to the table next to us and the lady was so sweet she gave us a taste of the squid salad! Definitely need to order that next time! Also, all their pasta is handmade fresh daily and we ordered the carbonara. Normally I don't care for cream sauces but this one was light and not too filling. The bacon they add to it cuts thru the cream with a bit of saltiness and crunch which was a good addition. \n\nThere are other restaurants in the area that I want to try but this place hit all the marks on the menu offerings.

Those $1.50 oysters and 6 dollar glasses of wine really hit the spot. \n\nThis was our first time and last (for a while) so we had to go big or go home. You have to get their mini clam chowder pot pies. I love the pastry puff with the steaming clam chowder. It was the perfect size as well. We shared their carbonara. Cream sauce was a little bland, you just have to eat the bacon with every bite to get that kick of taste. It was still good!

I did a Yelp search for oyster happy hours and found Red Hill Station. (Wasn't sure if there were going to be any as it was a Saturday.) We headed over and arrived around 4:45pm. We didn't have a reservation, but they had a table avail if we promised to be done by 6pm. This was just a post lunch (or brunch) / pre dinner snack, so we said yes!\n\nThey offer Happy Hour Daily, 3pm - 6pm. The specials are $1.50 oysters and 1/2 off all beer and wine on tap. The oyster selections for that day were: Shigoku, WA; Kusshi, WA; Miyagi, CA; BeauSoleil, NB. We decided to start with two dozen of all varieties. I can't recall which ones were which, but I typically like the smaller oysters the best so our last dozen were just those. In the end, we got 3 dozen HH oysters ($54).\n\nFor drinks, I decided to get beer. We had been drinking all day and it seemed like the easiest thing to drink. I wanted something light, so I went for the beer from Headlands Brewing Co, California ($4). Not sure which beer it was as they have a rotating selection on tap, but it checked the box in terms of the type of beer I wanted. I actually ended up having two pints as everyone else was nursing their one drink. The rest in our party got the following: Triennes 2016 Rose, Provence, France ($6); Giornata 2015 Sangiovese Blend, Paso Robles, California ($6); Marin Brewing Company, Point Reyes Porter ($4).\n\nThe table next to us got something fried (which smelled amazing), so we decided to order a Side of Onion Rings ($7). This was the last day of my deep fried food ban, so I couldn't try them. They did give us complimentary Olives which I had a few of. Very tasty. I think I was the only one eating them.\n\nGood place for oyster HH with wine and beer. Great specials! This place is tiny, so make sure to make a reservation if you plan on going. It may be a wait without one. We just got lucky that day. I guess oyster and us were meant to be.", "author": "Elena N."}

We started with the red trout tartare, which came with some chip type thing (although based on the menu, I was expecting more of a crostini type thing). The trout was  fresh, soft, and had some nice acidity, but was a little more of a ceviche than a tartare.  We also ordered the clam chowder pot pie and the sausage and clam pasta.  The clam chowder was solid and creamy, and the poufed pastry top was phenomenal. The pasta was rich and heavy- the sausage had a nice kick to it, but the flavors slightly overwhelmed the clam and pasta. In retrospect, our eyes were a little larger than our stomachs, and we probably would've been ok with two dishes. Overall though, everything was delicious and I definitely want to come back and try some of the other dishes.", "author": "Jenny C."}

Best cioppino I've had yet (granted I've only had this two or three times before), and would be my go to thing here.\n\nOyster dozen - 5/5. This came in four different varieties, and all of them had nice contrasting textures. Everything was fresh, and it came with three different sauces so you could put whatever you want on it.\n\nBaked Cod - 5/5. Fish was baked just right, and had the same soft and buttery texture as the cioppino. Veggies were solid as well.\n\nNew England Chowder Pot Pie - 4/5.

I've from Albany NY and in my travels, occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised by food that's really special. This is one of those times. Hands down, this was one of the best meal I've 'ever' had. I kid you not. Delicious, unique and a great presentation. The staff was knowledgeable and attentive.\n\nTraveling on bus and having caught the fog blowing over the hills at sunset from Burnel Hill (don't miss the short hike up!) I found this packed local joint 2 blocks from my Airbnb accommodations (373 Moultrie Street, San Francisco, CA 94110 - which was terrific). I started with a half order of their Monterey calamari salad and having happened upon a seat facing the kitchen, I watched 2 chefs work in perfect choreography, intent while smiling, they enjoyed their work. I'm use to calamari, deep fried, no garnish but a lemon, usually overcooked. I'd watched the chef gingerly flipping and tending to several rolled up pieces of something... over a high flame skillet and then realized ... they were cooking my calamari! Delicious and on an elegant bed of greens, terrific. \n\nI sampled four oysters from different parts of the world. Catch these at happy hour and they're just $1.50 each, I paid $2.50 each. They tasted smooth and creamy.\n\nFor dinner I had the Alaskan True Cod, it flaked apart beautifully and was served over delicious mashed potatoes with the slightest hint of nutmeg, and a unique blend of exceptionally flavorful vegetables. Absolutely delicious!!\n\nFor dessert I had a funnel cake with fresh strawberries blueberries and homemade whipped cream. \n\nAnd after that gastronomical eat festival I walked up to the top of Burnel Hill Park and spotted a coyote perfectly silhouetted along the ridge line. What a night.", "author": "Mark R."}

We were welcomed with a farmhouse meets oyster bar, a very intimate and welcoming appeal to your senses. Not overly noisy, so really nice to have a one-on-one conversation with your date/ group. Staff was 5 stars and super attentive without being bothersome. Olives and a heaping portion of bread was quickly dropped off with our red house wine creatively served in an Erlenmeyer flask as a carafe surrogate. \n\nWith a simple daily menu, we were out to try out their oysters and anchovy salad for starters and my SO chose the tuna linguini while I selected the oyster pot pie. Oysters were fresh and refreshing. Anchovy salad was our favourite due to the crisp texture, not overly batter fried, combined with a hint of lemon/pesto that perfectly complements the greens. In line with the American way, we wanted seconds and thirds.  \n\nOur entrees were served within a few minutes after wrapping up the appetizer. My SO's entree was the tuna linguini which was surprisingly delivered with a heaping portion of mussels and calimari. The pasta was cooked perfectly that embraced the seafood essence with delectable capers. Serving size was perfect for one. My oyster pot pie presented itself as a seafood chowder of sorts with a pastry puff/ slice of bacon pleasantly on top. It was rich and creamy, and delicious. Definitely on my list of favourite places in the city and I am looking forward to coming back over and over to fill up on my seafood cravings. The perfect date night place.", "author": "Pamela B."}

A group of friends and i went without a reservation at 6:30 PM and got seated almost immediately, right before the rush. I happened to be dining with some heavy spenders (to which I most definitely am not) so we ended up getting the Red Hill Special, and let me tell you, that was delicious! \n\nThe Red Hill special came with a dozen oysters, four had caviar on it, dungeness crab legs, and three kinds of fish mixes (yellow tail ceviche, little bay shrimps, and tuna tartare), with different sauces to eat with it (mignonette and cocktail). The oysters were amazing, and I really loved the ceviche, which had a good balance of the acidity. We added the 500ml of white wine, a Bokisch 2015 Alvaro from Lodi, which was a good wine to pair with all the seafood. \n\nIn addition to the Red Hill Special, the group ordered the Boston Clam Chowder pot pie (yummy!), the baked fillet (good but I was more focused on the special), and one of each of the dessert offerings- the creme brulee, chocolate pot de creme, and funnel cake. I didn't really like the funnel cake, the creme brulee was pretty standard, and the pot de creme was really rich! \n\nWill definitely come back to try out the cioppino, but the red hill special was super yummy!

A second star for the hostess because she was quite pleasant. Just sorry that she was put in a bind. \n\nI called on Friday to make reservations for Saturday nite at 7:30 for two people. My boyfriend had raved about this place after seeing it on Check Please. Took him over an hour to get to the spot from Oakland in bad bridge traffic. \n\nWe arrived on time and waited for half an hour and still didn't get seated for our reserved table. We ended up leaving. And even after my BF mentioned to the hostess that we decided to go elsewhere, it didn't sound like our reserved table was going to open up any time soon. And in her defense she was apologetic. But who knows how much longer we would have waited had we stayed. \n\nIt's reasonable to wait for a reserved table at a popular restaurant for 10-15 minutes. But having to wait for a reserved table for half an hour or more is beyond unacceptable.  It's poor management of the reservations process. And it's just bad business. \n\nI've been to plenty of restaurants in the city-- large group, table for two, reserved by phone-- where the hostess will inform me and or the large walk-in group that tables are reserved and that their time is limited. The majority of patrons are fine with that because they've been informed ahead of time and are mindful of the time. \n\nThe hostess was very courteous, gave us regular updates and served me a great cup of coffee and even offered a blanket while we waited outside. Yes it was quite chilly outside. I realize it wasn't her fault that the bday group monopolized a bunch of tables that were reserved. But still it's just not right to have patrons who planned ahead and reserved a table wait so long. It's simply poor planning and mgmt of the reservations process and walk-in patrons. \n\nThe restaurant website does say that they keep some tables open for walk-ins. However, I'm not so sure that system works given the capacity and popularity of the place. \n\nSo if the restaurant can't honor advance reservations they need to get rid of the option or simply better manage the process. They've been operating long enough to have a solid system in place and to mitigate these type of situations.", "author": "Jessica S."}

We started with salads - the Caesar (ok) and the Bay Shrimp salad (excellent - with a nice marinade on the shrimp, slices of grapefruit, etc. and a large portion}.  Three of our group had the cod baked with lemon and thyme.  Fish was flaky and fresh, but there was a bit too much crumb/butter topping.  Lots of mashed potato and a random vegetable.  I had the fresh crab - delicious.  Cracked and partially cleaned in a bowl that allowed lots of room for digging out out all that good stuff.   Accompanied by lemon and butter - doesn't get much better.  Nothing came with it in terms of veggies, so I was glad I had had the salad.  Bread was excellent and we love our bread.

Offered him something in Noe Valley (Basic) or something in Bernal Heights. We were both ready to rock Bernal Heights, and even though I'm down the road, sadly haven't explored this area enough. And even though I'm closer, he got there early.\n\nThe place is cute - a main dining area with about 8 tables, 4+ on each wall, and even a private dining room upstairs. The kitchen is visible the to the whole restaurant, and you can see and tell everything is made to order.\n\nMy buddy and I wanted to try everything, and we used the couple sitting next to us for advice. I mean, I love seafood pasta, the shrimp melt sounded good, and even the fish and chips have good reviews. As two hungry men, we decided to just share everything and had no major complaints.\n\n-Red Trout Tartare: this came out more like a ceviche, lemon juice and oil, all. But it was a lot of trout and was absolutely delicious. Would definitely get this again.\n-Monterrey Bay Squid Salad: to explain how good this was, the last couple to come in both got one for themselves. Grilled and seasoned perfectly, the squidlets and meat were great. Again, must get.\n-Clam Chowder Pot Pie. This was the weakest of the three dishes, but was still good. Also took the longest time, so clearly was made to order. See, for me clam chowder has to pass the spoon test - you put your spoon straight in, and if it stays standing up, you have a real chowdah! This was a watery broth, and with the pie crush, was probably the sweetest clam chowder I've had. But there were good pieces of clam inside.\n\nThere was more I'd love to try, like the cioppino, the pastas, and even the mussels. They also do dessert, but we were pretty full at that point.\n\nI'd also like to point out that the staff were wonderful. The waiter genuinely came across as loving his job, and trying to get the best meal to his customers.

We were a table of 4 people: two of us ordered the \"Oyster Pot Pie\" ($20); one ordered the fish tacos; the other ordered the \"Lemon Thyme Cod\", and asked for it to be made gluten-free.\n\nThe worst crime:  the \"oyster\" pot pies... mine contained 1/2 of one oyster (cut into two teeny pieces); the other diner's contained one single full oyster (cut into 2 pieces).  They arrive looking wonderful, with crispy browned puff pastry, but when you cut open the pastry, you find a thin, watery cream-based soup (homemade at least) with chiffonaded leeks and cubed potatoes -- and VIRTUALLY NO OYSTERS!  I'm not sure why they couldn't have thickened the mixture with a simple roux, and I'm absolutely mystified as to why an \"oyster pot pie\" for $20 didn't contain at least 3 or 4 oysters!\n\nThe second issue:  the \"lemon thyme\" cod...when we asked our server if the dish could be made gluten free, he said that they would leave off the bread crumb coating on the fish.  I said, \"But you'll include the lemon and the thyme?\", to which he said \"yes\".  When the dish arrived, it was a piece of plain UNSALTED/UNPEPPERED boiled cod with no lemon or thyme.  My companion had to ask for salt and pepper, because unseasoned fish is unpalatable.  It is beyond me why they couldn't have seared the fish with a little thyme, S&P, and lemon rind; gluten free should not have to be \"flavor free\"!\n\nThe fourth diner had the fish tacos, and said that they were \"good\" but unremarkable.\n\nCome on, Red Hill Station -- surely you could do better than that!!!", "author": "N W."}

Perhaps serve a clam chowder bowl pot pie and charge half the price or offer a bigger portion of salad with more than just greens? \n\nMy friend got the trio of pot pie and I felt a little ripped off for her.

I've been here twice so far and can't wait to go back!\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small but cozy. There are tables in the front and bar seating along the open kitchen. I believe there are also some tables in the back of the restaurant for private parties.\n\nFor appetizers, I've tried the Red Trout Tartare and the Bay Shrimp Stuffed Artichoke. The tartare was more like a ceviche, which wasn't big deal. The taste was simple, but still good and refreshing. It was great that they were pretty generous with amount of fish they put in. The bay shrimp appetizer on the other hand, was really small for $16. It was a refreshing dish also, but it wasn't anything special.\n\nFor entrees, I've tried the Monterey Calamari Grilled Salad, Toasted Almond Pesto Linguini with Gulf Prawns, and Vongole Manilla Clams Linguini. I've gotten the calamari salad during both visits, because it's that good. The salad itself was very refreshing with ingredients of beets and grapefruit. The calamari was seasoned and grilled to perfection. The pesto pasta was the best I've ever had! Usually pesto pastas lack flavor, but this one was excellent. There was a great amount of sauce and the prawns were also seasoned and cooked perfectly. The clam pasta was my favorite out of everything! The linguini was cooked al dente and the sauce was nothing short of amazing. They were generous with the clams, and everything tasted really fresh.\n\nFor dessert, we got the Candy Cap Creme Brulee. It was small, but really good. It is a little sweeter than the usual creme brulee, but we didn't mind. If you're looking for something sweet at the end of the meal, that's the option to go with.\n\nService was great both times I've come. They checked up on us during each dish to make sure we're enjoying everything.\n\nOverall, this is just an all around great restaurant! You won't be disappointed in anything you order. If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would! I will be recommending this place to every seafood lover I know.", "author": "Derek T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-08", "description": "A good atmosphere restaurant. Phenomenal service. Prompt seating. Greeted by the server as soon as I walked in, they seem to know who I was and led me to the table right away. I was 10 minutes early for my 8:15 reservation too. Nice to see they saved a table knowing you would show up. Some restaurants may tell you that they are running late even though you had a reservation which is obviously annoying. So this was just an incredibly smooth start.\n\nAnd that's not all. We found a parking space right by the restaurant. This never happens in North Beach, SoMa, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Marina, the Mission or Richmond. Just can't happen. Imagine that. Saturday evening, prime dining time, and viola, stars aligned and there we were.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint, stylish, cute and inviting. I liked that. Every restaurant so far in Bernal just felt that way. It's a very welcoming sight. We need more of that. \n\nSince I eat out practically ever night, and some weekends and lunches too, it's important to find those restaurants that created a right ambience that makes you want to come back to. Like Blue Plate or Front Porch. I already like this restaurant before setting my foot in.\n\nThe white pots hanging by the kitchen were neat. Turned out they serve their famous fish stew in. Friendly staff come by very quickly to chat with us. Asked what was popular and she recommended a few things. \n\nIt's important to pause here and note my companion choice of the night. N is French. As French as one can get without getting on my nerves. Our unique sense of humor come out together when we are together. Some people may think we are juvenile but when it comes to dining partners, N is as good as it gets. He knows his wine. He knows what goes with what. He is also disciplined like a French to not ever over order. I prefer him ordering because like a typical Chinese (well, I'm mostly Chinese as I recently learned on 23andme and bunch of other stuff), my eyes are bigger than my stomach and if it was left to me, the entire menu would be ordered. So I let him.\n\nFor that evening, he chose the monterey squid salad, which was supposed to be good. And mussels. The lady said the magic word of moules. What kind of French does not like moules? The kind that is NOT French of course. Wine pairing of the night was a light red N selected. I asked for coffee as I had started the day early with yoga, cycling, and attending an afternoon party. Surprisingly, the coffee was delicious. It's hard to imagine a restaurant serves coffee well when their main thing is seafood, but for reasons unclear, this was one cup of exceptional coffee. \n\nStaff came with green olive in sort of fish flavored sauce as a complimentary dipping sauce. Then the sourdough bread. Then the squid salad, tender and fresh local squid served on a bed of organic greens and grilled asparagus tip. \n\nMussel dish is not just filled with mussels but with sausage, served in a huge pot filled with steamy spicy and creamy broth, but not so creamy that you don't want to drink it. Nothing like drinking warm creamy broth on a windy evening makes one want to sing happy notes after, which, coincidently, was where we were headed after: a private saloon open mic party nearby.\n\nThe meal was thoroughly satisfying. For two people, one salad and one entree to share was more than enough, especially if you couple it with a glass of wine or two. \n\nThe fish stew looked exceptional actually besides what we ordered. The service was fantastic, easy parking, and the on time seating made it even more appealing.\n\nA great restaurant to come and hang out with your favorite bud.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I bookmarked Red Hill Station when they first opened in June 2014 but wanted to see how the reviews were before paying a visit. They maintained quite stellar ratings and it was close by to where both my gf and I live so we thought, now was the time to give them a shot. \n\nSorry but after dining there, I don't understand the hype over Red Hill Station. It's overrated; the food is mediocre at best and the service is disorganized.\n\nAfter our waitress recommended the Carbonara ($16.95), my gf and I split that as a starter: http://bit.ly/1zmDAaI. The pasta was perfectly al-dente and the carbonara was rich and creamy. I liked the addition of breadcrumbs for a nice textural contrast. Usually carbonara is made with diced bacon or pancetta but oddly, the bacon here was in strips, making it difficult to eat. \n\nHere's where things went downhill... \n\nKnowing that the owners are Anchor Oyster Bar alums, I was most excited for the Cioppino which was available in half and whole orders. The waitress said that, a \"whole\" order comes with a whole crab while a \"half\" order comes with half a crab. We ordered a whole to share as our main ($35.95): http://bit.ly/1BcgqWF. We were baffled when a huge platter was set on our small table with a bunch of mussels and two dinky pieces of crab. My gf has a fish allergy so they kindly left out the cod.\n\nWe alerted one of the staff who turned out to be the owner. We thought maybe they made a mistake in the kitchen and told her we ordered a \"whole\". She apologized for our server's miscommunication and said, \"That's how the cioppino is served here...without crab legs.\" My gf and I sat there really confused because I was 100% certain that I had seen crab legs and claws served in the cioppino pics posted on their Yelp page. I then asked, \"So the restaurant charges for a 'whole' crab but only give customers two pieces?\" She looked as confused was we were and offered to take it off our bill which was a nice gesture. She added that if we wanted a whole crab, then we could have ordered the Crab with white wine sauce. We would have but that wasn't on the menu we were given: http://bit.ly/13JL52W. \n\nAside from the missing crab pieces, the cioppino was sorely disappointing and not even in the same league as Anchor Oyster Bar. The mussels were meaty and tender but the broth/sauce was nothing more than canned tomatoes with herbs throw in as garnish. It was devoid of any flavor whatsoever. This was NOT a cioppino but rather a mussel tomato stew garnished with crab that ended having one tablespoon worth of meat. \n\nService was disorganized and confusing. We were seated by a male staff member who we thought was our waiter. When other tables who came after us started ordering (we were first to arrive), a female server came over to us and said, \"Oh you guys never ordered?\" =/ Nope. She was really nice though. We were there for dinner but the menus said, \"lunch\". My gf and I then were given dessert menus...from different seasons. The cioppino was still on the bill and we had to alert the owner to take it off. \n\nPreviously Tinderbox Restaurant that shuttered in 2008, I'm not a fan of current cramped and loud space. The tables are small and too close for comfort with (guy next to us almost accidentally knocked over our plates). Additionally, the serving platters are too clunky and it was annoying having to play table Tetris. Not the best place for an intimate date because of the poor acoustics.\n\nMediocre dinner and lackluster service aside, with the kind gesture to comp the cioppino dish, I was going to give Red Hill Station 3 stars. That's until, I went home and saw the following which confirmed my initial thought and contradicted what the owner had told us:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1AS3A1O\n\nAdmittedly, I may have beer goggles on half the time but that is crab claws and crab legs no?!?\n\nNot cool, Red Hill Station.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I appreciated the on time seating, friendly service, and fresh food. I loved the private table we had reserved at the back of the restaurant - it was a cozy booth with a window to the kitchen. I would not encourage walk ins because the restaurant is small and pretty popular.\n\nThe key to a good experience at Red Hill is ordering the right dishes - I loved my first experience but thought the second visit was average. You MUST order the mushroom creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e if it's still on the menu! I was unimpressed by their supposedly famous pot pies (too heavy and salty) and ceviche, and would discourage you from the garlic cod. I would come back to try their the mussels, linguini vongole, or Caesar salads. \n\n* Complimentary bread and olives: Huge meaty green olives and bread served with olive oil and balsamic. I thought it was a nice way to start but the bread could be fresher. \n* Scallop Ceviche - 2.5 stars: This was one small, but beautifully presented, overly salty scallop.\n* Tuna tartare - 3.5 stars: The tuna tartare was much better than the ceviche, it was good but standard.\n* Sampler of Pot Pies - 3 stars: Clam chowder (standard), bolognese (too salty - least favorite), and pork shoulder (tasted like Moroccan lamb seasoning). Overall it's a cool and unique idea but I wasn't a fan. If I had to pick, I would order the pork shoulder.\n* Garlic Cod - 2.5 stars: Overcooked and dry, not a fan of the sauce. \n* Linguini Carbonara - 2.5 stars: would return for other pastas but the carbonara is way too rich and reminded me of the Lean Cuisine carbonara sauce. Pasta not made in house. \n* Funnel cake - 3.5 stars: good, but standard. \n* Lacey strawberry - 3.5 stars: good, kind of light. \n* Mushroom Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - 5 stars: Surprising favorite with a strong mushroom flavor only when you first taste it. Weird but good!", "author": "Jess C."}

Although parking is not the easiest in the area it was well worth hunting for a spot!  The food was delicious all around from appetizers to fish!  Very fresh and well prepared entrees.  The wine list was small but well chosen. Overall the service was excellent and attentive.   We had one issue with either an order did not get put in or the kitchen missed it, but our server was very apologetic and comped the dish because it arrived so late.  I think so many of us  get so demanding and expect perfect service all the time, but we all make mistakes (don't we), but  I judge how you handle them in the end.

It is a very small restaurant and when we arrived it was full so we left our cell number and they said it would probably be around 30 minutes and they would text us when a table was ready so we found a nearby bar and waited with a drink.  After about 35 minutes, we walked back even though we hadn't heard anything.  The host came out and apologized for the wait and offered me a blanket and gave us a drink menu.  He brought me a glass of wine and the blanket since there is no seating area to wait inside.  He continued to check on us (so nice!) and eventually we got a table looking into the kitchen which was a great view.  \n\nHe got the ciopinno and I got fettucini with andoiulle sausage and clams.

It was his birthday lunch and I wanted to show his family visiting from southern CA an enjoyable time. They were excited about eating some great sf cioppino based on their delicious past experiences. I dine out with friends and family for the combination of good ambiance, good food, and good service, so here is my, and I speak for our family, review of our experience.\n\nFood: \nLinguine with clams ($24)- so salty that our grandma had to pour water over it. Use more water and lemon when working with clams... it's naturally really salty. \n\nSalad with octopus ($22) - good dressing. Octopus was salty too... :( \n\nHangar steak ($32) probably the best thing we had. There were 5 thin slices of steak and 2 Brussels sprouts but they were perfectly cooked.\n\nCioppino ($70) - cold, took 1.5 hours, and it was not up to par with anchor oyster bar. If you know it will take a long time for cioppino, set upfront expectations and maybe show some sincere care for the people who are staring quietly at the kitchen window anticipating the hot cioppino to come out. Maybe come by and say \"sorry for the wait\" and it will take x more minutes... even if it's and estimate.\n\nService: I have lived in the Bay Area for 5 years, and I never felt so much cold shouldering and discrimination from an sf restaurant. I hate speculating this as the case but I felt like we didn't even get one warm thank you or sincere \"how is everything.\" I asked politely \"do you know how much longer the cioppino will take\" and I would get a snarky \"we have a lot of people today so yeah...\" I realized how much attitude really impacts diners' experiences at that moment because that whole meal became a huge waste of time and money. \n\nWe we the only Asian family in the establishment... but I'm not going to assume racial prejudice. We felt it based on how we were treated compared to every other table, so I'll leave it at that.", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

It really was a toss up between that and the salmon which equally sounded fabulous. But I kept thinking of when I walked in and how delicious and enticing that fish and chips smelled..... done and done.\nAnd I wasn't disappointed! Crispy and the fish perfect and moist inside, serve with these  crispy matchstick style fries.

I hear they can get busy so I made a reservation on Opentable.  \n\nFor an appetizer, we decided to split the carbonara ($16.95).  The waitress' recommendation was amazing!  The sauce was creamy and topped with bacon and breadcrumbs.  Splitting the dish is recommended.  The size was perfect as a starter and the sauce would've been too rich to eat as an entree.\n\nFor our entree, we were both interested in the cioppino.  Being that I'm allergic to fish, I had ask if they use a fish stock before we ordered it.  Our waitress went to the kitchen and came back to inform us that they use tomato sauce and chicken broth and they would be able to leave out the cod to accommodate my allergy.  We went with a whole order ($35.95) for the whole crab (opposed to $23.95 for half a crab).  \n\nWhen the cioppino came, it was in a huge platter, but something was wrong.  There were two tiny pieces of crab.  My friend and I had blank stares on our faces wondering where the rest of it was.  We spoke to who we appeared to be the owner or manager who said that's how their cioppino is usually served.  She informed us that \"whole\" and \"half\" on the menu meant the size of the order, not the amount of crab.  We let her know that our waitress had told the other table that it meant a half or whole crab.  She was apologetic and mentioned she would take the cioppino off the bill which I thought was a nice gesture.  Seriously though, I would NOT pay $36 for what appeared to be half of a crab body chopped in half, mussels, and what tasted like canned tomato sauce...and what do they do with the rest of the crab?!  The dish is skimped on the seafood and consisted mostly of tomatoes.  Not worth ordering.\n\nMy girlfriend was convinced she saw crab legs.  When we got home, she texted me a picture of what she found on Yelp...cioppino with crab legs and all.  Please don't lie, especially when there's proof on the internet.  \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Menu changes especially desserts with seasonal fruit\n*Tables are tiny.  If we were the first party dining, why would you seat the next group who walked in right next to us instead of spacing parties out!?\n*They don't pay attention to their menus.

I shared the first one with my family but the second was all for me.  We also had oysters on the half shell, clam chowder, mini pot pie, and carbonara.  Everything was cooked to perfection but what really stood out was the delicious light broth in the clam chowder...yes, I did say broth, not the thick heavy white creamy soup.  And I love the fact that they used a mixture of shellfish.  The pot pie was insanely yummy.  Now, I am not a fan of carbonara but we ordered it for my husband.

This two months old seafood-centric place is brought to you by two Anchor Oyster Bar alums.  Since I love all kinds of seafood, I am always on the lookout for new seafood restaurants.  So, on this Thursday night, I dragged Mr. J out to get a head start on the weekend.\n\nRed Hill Station offers a small intimate menu because it changes daily.  Mr. J and I got 3 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.  I can't believe I forgot to order the oysters.  D'oh!  I was sad because they ran out of the black cod.\n\nThings we had:\n\n--- Caesar with fresh seasonal Oregon Bay shrimp - The light and tangy made to order Caesar dressing was in perfect harmony with the romaine and shrimp.  I am not a big fan of these tiny Bay shrimp because they are normally 'fishy', but not these ones!\n\n--- Fried local fresh anchovies with pesto di limone - Just one word, ah-mazing!  This got to be my favorite dish for the night since I am still raving about it!  They weren't kidding when they said the anchovies are lightly breaded.  The breading was so thin that you don't even notice yet still added that extra texture.  I dislike overly breaded things and this is not one of them.  The pesto and the white sauce goes swimmingly with the anchovies.\n\n--- Wild Ft. Bragg King salmon tartare with chives and red onion, crostini, micro arugula - Another light and refreshing dish.  The cracked black pepper on the toasted crostini was a great touch.\n\n--- Grilled fresh Monterey calamari with roasted white peach and black fig vinaigrette, summer roasted cherry tomato and vegetable salad - Wow, it was beautifully presented and perfectly grilled.  Yumm...\n\n--- Torchino pasta with cove mussels, savory clams, corona beans, fresh garlic, white wine, oregano, parsley, Italian sausage, pangrattata - This was probably my least favorite dish for the night, it was a bit 'too busy'.  I think it would be a better dish if the pasta was more al dente and the beans were taken out.\n\n--- Lace cookies and cream, organic blueberries, strawberries - We were so full already but we had to try dessert.  Thankfully, this dessert was very light and not too sweet to wrap our night up.\n\nEveryone at the restaurant were so friendly and attentive.  Everything were reasonably priced and their portion sizes were very generous.  Couple little friendly suggestions though...  It would be nice if the windows can open up.  It can get a little stuffy in there.  Also, maybe get some black linen napkins as well.  I was wearing black and the white linen napkin shedded tons of lint on me.  Not a super big deal.

The fish in chips were...well, at least the fish, was excellent. The chips? I believe they ran the fries thru the ocean before settling in the bowl. Man, talk about salty.

The waiter highly recommended it so we had very high expectations which were easily surpassed. The dressing is apparently made individually for each salad and they apply the dressing and Parmesan to each leaf of lettuce individually before stacking it back together. Instead of hard croutons, they do this crumb topping which is tastier and easier to eat. The calamari was as tender as it was flavorful and deserves it's on paragraph.\n\nThe wife ordered the Vongole with clams which came out perfectly al dente. I ordered the cod which came on a bed of corn/bacon and it was an awesome dish as well.

Even just with the two of us, they let us sit at the large table upstairs with a window facing the kitchen. It was quieter upstairs since we had the whole room to ourselves, and we got to see the hustle and bustle in the kitchen, so we really appreciated the staff for letting us do so. \n\nFor starter, we had the fried smelt with pesto and Caesar salad with calamari. Boy, were they good! The pesto really cut the fishiness of the smelt along with a side salad as a palate cleanser. The calamari was piping hot when it came out, very peppery and juicy, with good texture. They did an excellent job with the calamari. The main course was clams with wine sauce. The clams were fresh and the wine sauce was a delicious broth with butter, thyme, lemon and some bits of garlic. I wanted to pick up the pan and just drink the broth by itself. Our dessert chocolate pot de creme was rich and decadent with chocolate and light and fluffy with the whipped cream on top.

The prices are higher than neighborhood joints of yore but the big portions make up for that. This is food you will want to share. Rather than everything being two bite \"tapas\" the salads are large enough to be meals themselves.\n\nThis is not fancy food, this is very basic but delicious seafood staples. The menu is not huge and if you aren't a seafood or fish fan do not come here. Ordering a salad and an entree is more than enough food for  two people.\n\nBeing gluttons we ordered too much food. They had four choices of oysters from Marin and Washington State and we got 8 at $2.50 each. They were large and fresh served with a simple mignonette.\n\nThen we had the stuffed artichoke with bay shrimp. There was good portion of shrimp and the sauce, fresh beans and beet was a great addition but the artichoke leaves were a bit tough. Would probably skip this dish again.\n\nOur salad  was Baby greens with lardon, fried soft boiled egg, burrata, radish, red pepper, asparagus for $13. The portion was large, the scotch egg was great, the lardon was actually just strips of bacon rather than lardons. It was a very satisfying salad.\n\nWe finished with Cod Fish and Chips, slaw, lemon aioli, fries. two pieces of cod that were crisp outside and tender inside but the batter could have used some salt.\n\nWe didn't have a reservation so sat at small counter that sits 4.

My boyfriends family from the South Of France came with us one night while visiting, and they were a hard crowd to please, and man  oh man, every single one of them were raving about this place. Truly one of the gems of SF and as a foodie, I would go as far to say it is one of the top 3 restaurants in the bay area. \n\nHIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommend!

That's what we were told at least. \"There will be no crab in your stew because the crab season is done.\" We came here especially to have the cioppino and I am so disappointed! It's unreal that we paid more than $120 for tomato soup with a TON of clams and mussels. There was a playing card size fish chunk and about a handful of fresh oregano s well as a small slice of garlic bread. All of the flavors were great but slightly spicy for some. Personally I prefer oregano to be taken off of the woody branches. There's nothing quite like eating a few weeds with every bite.  That might work on the tourists but you should really watch out who you lie to about the food you serve. You might just lie to the wrong person who actually has a fishing license and goes for crab.", "author": "Kevin C."}

It's unfortunate as I love seafood and live in the neighborhood. \n\nService: The service was extremely slow both visits. The waitress also had inaccurate information about wait time.

We were seated in this awkward bar area in front of kitchen where I could barely get into my seat because it was so close to the couple next to us (and I'm not a big person). The waitress didn't have enough space to even place the dishes in front of us - she has to slide them down the bar, which was a bit strange. We didn't get any food besides bread until 50 minutes after we were seated. We ordered oysters, and those didn't come until our entrees were ready. \n\nFood: The food wasn't bad but nothing stood out. Some was over-salted, and other items were under-seasoned.\n\nHighlight: The helper/bus person was really professional and took up most of the slack of the waiters. He came to check on us often and kept a really positive attitude servicing all of the tables that night. I even saw him help with shucking the oysters after the waiter was completely failing (waiter was basically stabbing the oysters and seemed like he had never done it before although he was there the first time I visited).\n\nOverall underwhelmed with the experience.

We thought we would start with something else first. He gave us the drink menu and asked what we would like. We each got a glass of prosecco and patiently waited for our table to open up. Two appetizers, entrees, and a dessert later, we are brought the bill. We were charged $14 for the prosecco.

And of course, we had a reason to celebrate.\n\nIt was a small intimate place, already buzzing busy early on a Friday night.  So make sure you have reservations.  And note that they close early at 10 pm.\n\nWe were greeted with a friendly smile and our server was awesome.\n\nOne mishap was when we were being sitted - they tried to sit all 5 of us at a table for 4 by the window.  We clearly will not fit.  One of my friends had to sit with no table access while we wait for them to figure out our sitting situation.  Luckily, the table next to us were done and we were able to combine tables and had the room we needed.  And the wait for our food is really long.  That was almost annoying at the beginning but it all worked out at the end.\n\nI had the carbonara.  This dish is heavy with a really creamy sauce.  The pasta was lined with bacon bits and bacon at the bottom, so it can get salty.  But since I like white sauce and salty and bacon, this dish was right for me.  The service size was decent too.  My other friends ordered the mussel soap and that dish was really well done as well.  The base tasted like a spicy curry soap - it was great!\n\nWe all enjoyed our dishes and the restaurant.

I made my honey take me here for cleaning his house, which is steps away. Each dust bunny and wall wipe was one step closer to the amazing-looking menu that made me salivate.\n\nThen we get there at 8 for our 8 reservation. It's SRO, and the place is tiny. We're asked if we would like some wine while we wait \"outside\" and we agreed to the wine, but taking it outside felt awkward because we were pretty sure that's illegal. So we awkwardly clutched our glasses of unknown-priced prosecco with our butts in other clients' faces hoping to be seated soon.\n\nAt 8:25, thankfully we were finally seated for our 8, because I was about to chew my own arm off. When I said \"OK\" to \"how are you?\" and was greeted with the third degree on why only okay, I mentioned the time. We were told this was \"San Francisco standard\" and basically felt like we had a mini-lecture about why no SF resident should expect to be seated right at their reservation time. While I totally accept that all kinds of things are out of their control, what could have hurt about a simple apology?\n\nGeez.\n\nSo, that's part of the service problem. The rest of the service problem is the long wait in between questions and answers, starters and mains...we waited so long for everything I felt more like a prisoner than a guest. Also apparently the wine fridge was on the fritz so we were not presented with a wine list in print, just verbal, with no prices. It's one thing to roll the dice on a $9 glass of wine, but we had no idea whether that meant $9, $11, $14....? So that was weird too. The cooler going out was beyond their control but not being able to give prices was not.\n\nOh yes, and let's not forget that the dude in the apron and striped pants (head chef, yes?) was hanging out with customers for 20 of those 25 minutes in the dining room and NOT cooking. Could that have been the reason for the terrible kitchen timing with everything? Are you a chef or a host? Pick, because you can't do both.\n\nSo, the food. We were pleased to find they could make the Caesar dressing vegetarian, and the Caesar was tasty and unique (crispy crumbs, no croutons) and worth $10. I ordered the cod, and my honey ordered the farro dish. Lo and behold, we got the exact same thing, only mine had cod for an extra $6, and he had slightly more veggies. Farro in brodo and summer veggies. It was good, but exactly what I'd throw together at home after a trip to Monterey Market and Monterey Fish Market. Exactly. \n\nI felt like I was paying to eat in my own living room. I could have grilled that squash and steamed those beans. I could also import special Italian farro. I go to restaurants to eat what I can't make or don't have time to make, so I feel kinda shorted when I'm handed Le Boring. I have the patent on Le Boring already.\n\nThey clearly were aware of how terrible they timing and everything was; they comped all our wine (4 glasses). Because of that generosity I might go back.

Overall, the food was *very* good, but not consistent. Some of the dishes were out-of-this-world delicious, but others were not quite right. \n\nThe complimentary garlicky olives served with bread were flavorful and probably are house-made. We started with a plate of oysters that were as fresh and tasty as any in the city, served with a good quantity of nice, tart mignonette. An appetizer of fried local anchovies with pesto and arugula was a great combination of flavors, but it didn't quite come off right: there was way too much pesto on the plate, and way too much dressing on the arugula; the dish was still tasty because of the fresh and perfectly cooked anchovies, but I don't think we'd order it again. As a main, my husband had a linguine with mixed shellfish, and this dish was perfect in every way -- pasta just al dente, seafood cooked just right, in a rich broth that exploded with flavor -- good enough all by itself to justify a return visit. I had ling cod in almond butter with roasted potato and vegetables; the cod was fantastic, perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sweet almond butter and toasted almonds to perfect the flavors. A single large fingerling potato was perfectly roasted. The other vegetables, though, were not right. I like my vegetables crisp, but the green beans were almost raw; by contrast the roast squash was falling apart and mushy from being roasted too long. \n\nThe service was very friendly and helpful, but the coordination with the kitchen needs work. At a certain point, it seemed like the kitchen had finished cooking pasta, and so pasta dishes were served to one table after another. It was at least another five minutes before fish dishes started to come out of the kitchen and get served. The result was that, if everyone at your table ordered pasta, then you all got served at once; but if one of you ordered fish and the other ordered pasta, there was a long delay. This is not OK; in a restaurant at this level, the whole table needs to be served at the same time.  \n\nThe ambience and d\u00e9cor are Bernal Heights casual, but the prices are not. Dinner was $100 for two, not including wine.  \n\nWe loved some of the dishes so much that we will definitely go back, and would love to have a successful seafood place in Bernal. But we do hope to see them iron out some of the kinks that were so noticeable on our first visit. \n\nWe say 3 stars now, but with clear potential to reach 4 or 5 with a bit more polish.", "author": "David K."}

I had the pleasure of having lunch there earlier today.\n\nThe amuse bouche consisted of a few olives in a warmed lemon - olive oil with minced capers and anchovies.  Absolutely delicious.  The bread was a yeasty, whole-wheat bread with a perfect crumb and crust.  \nI had the Caesar Salad with Grilled Calamari.  It was the best salad, let alone caesar salad, I have had in my life.  The lemony-garlic olive oil dressing was perfect - the calamari was grilled amazingly tender - the romaine perfectly crisp - and the crumpled croutons a lovely touch.\nDelightful and helpful staff.\nAfter leaving was queried on the street about my experience and I raved about my meal.  I had to return shortly to pick up something left behind and saw the person lunching contentedly on Linguine Vongole.  Definitely spread the word!", "author": "Terry A."}

I ordered the clam linguine which was delicious! They were very generous with their clams and the taste totally hit the spot. The mister ordered the fish and steak tacos. I didn't find that mix well. I really shouldn't even give that dish a review since I only took a bite. Did I mention my clam linguine was divine? They also have a kids' menu!\nAnyway, the complimentary bread (served with olive oil and basalmic) and olives were a big bonus. The bread was super fresh. It helped calm us down a bit when we had to wait 35 minutes for the food to come. That's why I took away the star because the loooong wait. The service was friendly. After a while, our server wasn't as welcoming as he came to us 3 times to let us know our food is almost ready...and almost ready...and almost here, but it didn't come until 35 minutes later. After a while, I started to get annoyed because the wait was absurd. What was weird was the table who sat down 15 mins later, got the food the same time we did. \nBesides the long wait for the food (but since it was good, I won't complain too much), everything about this place was great.", "author": "Em T."}

Starting from the Presidio, I might as well be going to Napa or the East Bay considering travel time.  But never mind that, the place is popular with locals as person after person who came in was known to and received a hug from the chef.  My server was OK, and that is something considering that the place is relatively new.\n\nI started with a Caesar salad with bay shrimp.  One thing that the restaurant should clarify on the menu is that there is a surcharge for the shrimp.  Nevertheless, the serving size was huge, the romaine and shrimp were fresh, and while at first blush I thought the dressing was going to be too oily, it was pretty much spot on.  A very good plate of food.\n\nAn appetizer of sausage meatballs was nice enough.  What made the dish was the bright tomato sauce that surrounded the meatballs.  While the meatballs were obviously house made they were overshadowed by the fresh sauce.  \n\nMy main of fish and chips was a case of too much of a pretty good thing.  The potato sticks were a bit overcooked and somewhat hard to get from the bowl to my mouth.  The black cod was obviously fresh but played second fiddle to a coating of perfectly fried crust that was a bit too ample.  The crust could also have used just a bit of seasoning.  The slaw that came with the fish was akin to sauerkraut but wasn't sufficiently astringent to go with the fried food.\n\nI should comment that my salad and main would have constituted a very ample meal by themselves.  So be aware that Red Hill Station is very generous with their portioning.", "author": "David D."}

We ended up parking in the neighborhood since there was a bunch of construction zones on Cortland. They have some small one lane streets that are two way to traffic in Bernal Heights. On Courtland Street, the neighborhood businesses seem untouched by time. It reminded me of Mission Street and Geneva Ave about twenty years ago. \nThe service was pretty good at Red Hill.  I had the steelhead trout for lunch. The trout was great. It had a slight burnt flavor on some bites but I think that was the way it was supposed to be. Usually the sides, vegetable and sometimes the potatoes are an afterthought. But the vegetable were great as was the potatoes.\nMy wife got the pot pie sampler, which consisted of a mini oyster pot pie, beef pot pie and clam pot pie. The oyster turned out to be the tastiest followed by the oyster and then the beef. If you get the pot pie, I would say go for the sampler. I think it called Pot Pie Flight.

But my cod was merely passable, not remarkable, and the experience was ruined by two things:\n\n(1) Being seated right next to a glass door that sticks - which customers would, naturally, open every two minutes and blast me with the chilly evening Bernal winds and leave ajar, never noticing, forcing me to close it again and again so I didn't freeze.\n\n(2) The positively ear-splitting volume, which is already common enough in SF restaurants (and some customers are getting quite sick of that, thank you), but which was even more pronounced here, and augmented by the boisterous talk of other tables and the frequent CLANG of utensils being thrown in the kitchen, effectively making conversation impossible.\n\nI might give you another chance when you fix that door. Seriously. That really ruined the whole night.", "author": "Bill P."}

The food gets 5 stars, but they lose one star because the service was a bit spotty. Everything we ate was delicious -- especially the calamari salad, linguine with pesto, and the steamed mussels + clams + pork belly. The calamari salad was a great, surprising combination of calamari, arugula, and roasted figs. The broth in the mussels + clams + pork belly dish was some of the best I've ever had in a dish like that, and it went really well with the crusty bread they brought. We also started with oysters, which tasted very fresh. The Calm Cove oysters from Washington were HUGE!\n\nHowever, there were a couple of periods during the meal where we had trouble getting our server's attention, such as when we wanted to order more drinks and at the end of the meal when we couldn't get the check and then when we couldn't get her to take our credit card for awhile. I thought the pacing was a little bit off, as we waited a long time between our appetizers and our entrees, and our waitress forgot the side of french fries we ordered. By the time we realized that they were not coming, we were too far into our entrees to remind her. It didn't show up on the bill, so I'm assuming she forgot. She repeated our order to us when we ordered, but she didn't write anything down when she took our order -- that was sort of a bummer. I'll definitely give them a pass on the service issues since they're so new, especially since the food was so good. I look forward to going back again once I can get another table!", "author": "Pilan C."}

We celebrated my dad's bday and were so happy to see oyster pot pie on the menu -his favorite!  All the pot pies were so tasty and the crust was tender and flaky. The only one that didn't hit the mark was the pulled pork since it was more of an Asian curry flavor and the anise was too strong. The calamari salad was delicious and my mom enjoyed the lamb shank.

It was a perfect spot to get the vibe of the restaurant without too much noise. \nAnd the food was incrediblel!  We started with a platter of oysters which were super fresh, followed by  fried smelt and tuna tartare, both of which were perfectly done and served. The tuna tartare, in particularly, had an amazing dipping sauce. The main courses were just as fresh and delicious.  My ling cod tacos were tasty as could be and came with an arugula salad.  One of our party had the short ribs and that was also cooked to perfection. So Taylor, the chef, can do more than just seafood.  They do it all very, very well. I'm not a big dessert person, but the funnel cake is pretty special, not too sweet and melts in your mouth.

Unfort they were out of the trout but we ordered the tuna carpaccio which was a nicely generous portion and delish. The ceasar-- oh my stars-- heavenly. A heaping pile of seasoned bay shrimp in top! I'll be back just for that alone. Since there was no trout our only option was the skirt steak with baby carrots and small potatoes. Again another winner and large portion. \nI have to say, it might have been a soft opening but they woo'd us pretty hard. Friendly and warm and delicious. And btw the chef/owner is quite dashing.

Three of us went, thus tripling our tasting opportunities. \n\nFor starters, I had fried anchovies, which must have been fried very hot and very quickly as they were crispy, delicate, and light--oh, and delicious. They were obviously fresh and had come out of the bay--or wherever anchovies live--that morning.  My dining companions had a prosciutto plate and the caesar salad (sans bay shrimp), both of which were very good.  [small note on the caesar: the dressing tends to the lemony and we decided that the shrimp must be the perfect accompaniment. Next time, we'll follow the recommendations of others and get it with the shrimp].\n\nFor entrees, we had trout;  fettuccini with clams, spagna beans, and andouille sausage; and bison stew.  All were quite good.  The trout was cooked to perfection and everything on the plate was a delight: the potatoes, which often just fill a plate, were tasty and even the fried sage leaves were more than just a garnish.   The bison stew was the kind of dish that you think about days, even weeks later on those cold-ish foggy nights in winter (or summer) when a stew would be perfect.\n\nThe creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert was very good, but hands-down favorite was the deconstructed hostess cup cake.\n\nBefore dining here, I read the 4-5 star reviews and wondered if the ratings were high because the place is new and all the reviewers were probably friends. Whether that's true or not, the reviews are well earned!\n\nIn sum, we liked this restaurant.  A lot.  The food is fabulous, the staff is friendly and competent.

The restaurant was about half full, although the waitress told us that it had been packed most of the evening.  We started off with a dozen oysters and a couple of glasses of Sauvignon Blanc.  The oysters were delicious, which was not surprising given that this place advertises as an oyster bar, but the wine was also quite good.  It came out of a tap (which I have not seen very often) and was crisp and well structured - obviously selected by someone who knew about quality wines.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the black cod, which was baked and sprinkled with toasted almonds and crispy sage leaves.  The cod was probably the best cod I have ever had: buttery and tender, yet still firm, and the sage and almonds added a lovely delicate flavor.  It also came with a grilled white peach, which is in season right now and very sweet.  Sides included roast potatoes and squash. The dish was generous in portion and quite reasonably priced for the quality.  \n\nThe chef/owner (who is a handsome Sicilian man who used to cook at Anchor Oyster Bar) came out and chatted with us for a while, since we wound up being the last customers in the restaurant.  He was quite funny and warm, and made us feel well taken care of.  He told us about the process of fixing up the restaurant and it sounded like quite a barn-raising - the previous owners had left it in shambles so they pulled together a big team of friends to help clean and remodel it on a shoe-string budget!     \n\nThis restaurant has just opened up and has apparently generated quite a buzz already.  I'd recommend making reservations in advance, although they do have tables reserved for walk-in.", "author": "Meg S."}

Very limited wine and beer selection. The wines weren't necessarily the best matches for seafood, especially oysters. \nThe oyster selection was decent - 4 types. Amply chilled. $2.50 a piece is good compared to some other spots in SF. We split a dozen and were aiiight on the oysters. \nThe fried anchovies were perfectly battered and salted. Small portion. Pesto was way too oily and too much for the fish. The dish was garnished with butter lettuce. \nCalamari salad.  Calamari was overcooked. Slim portion. The supporting salad players were tasty. The salad contained butter leaf lettuce which ended-up being a theme in 3 of our dishes. \nThe clam crudo and fritter. Butter lettuce! The fritter component was good - the raw clams - they were overly cured or something. Too chewy. \nI was Ok with the casual decor but the prices were far from casual. Pretty spendy for small portions and subpar fare. \nService was awkward. \nI might go back - just for oysters and some wine on tap. Try some other stuff after they get their sea legs. \nWe opted not to try other dishes and went elsewhere for part deux of dinner.....", "author": "Carson R."}

I told waitress 1 (shorter, medium length hair) my name and that I had a reservation for 2. She walks off to check, and doesn't reappear. A bit later, after seeing me just standing around, waitress 2 (taller, younger, very short hair) asks if I have a reservation, I say yes, and she promptly seats my girlfriend and I. Why waitress 1 didn't do that and where she went is beyond me. \nNext we sit down and place a bottle of wine I had brought on the table. Waitress 1 comes by, asks if we wanted the bottle opened - I said yes - then takes the bottle and disappears into the back. This is a huge faux pas. Now I don't need a song and dance with cork smelling and the sort, but you never ever take someone's bottle out of sight, then return with it opened. She could have done literally anything to it (the big concern is she pours it out, then refills the bottle with something else - that's why it is such poor etiquette to take the bottle out of sight like that). The wine tasted how it was supposed to (ie not doctored), but it's still should not have been done.\nWe place our orders all at once, oysters, app, 2 entres and eagerly wait for our food - the entire menu sounded great! \nFirst to arrive was the anchovies, the dish is a grill so they were cooked. I don't know who messed up the timing, the kitchen or the waitress, but you shouldn't serve a cooked dish (or really any dish) before oysters. It just didn't make sense. Then, when we were still eating the anchovies, she arrived with our oysters. This crowded out table and made us rush through the anchovies. She could have waited until we had finished one dish, before bringing out the next. \nLater my calamari arrived, but our table hadn't been bussed so waitress 1 took our side plates and utensils to bring out clean ones. So I had my calamari sitting in front of me with no way to eat it. It was actually kind-of comical. Later she returns and gives me a fork and a knife and my girlfriend just a fork. I had calamari she ordered cod. If anything the lone knife should've been given to her. \nWe then sat waiting for the second dish - I don't like to eat before the whole party gets their food. We waited about 5 mins before jointly deciding that my food was getting cold. Then we started to share my dish when waitress 1 promises that the cod is on it's way. We stop sharing and continue to wait. Probably another 10 mins went by and my girlfriend insisted I eat. I did, the food was completely cold by that point. Around the time I finished my dish the cod arrived.\nI sat politely and waited while my girlfriend ate her dish (a very odd situation, hard to make conversation while someone's eating and I had nothing to eat myself). Waitress 1 comes over and apologizes saying the cod is on the house. She then asked if we wanted dessert, and when I say everything on the menu looked good I mean everything including all the desserts, but we declined because we were positive it would be screwed up in some way. \nWaitress 1 brings our check and takes a card. She then returns later with a receipt sleeve. We open it to find just one receipt. No card, no signable receipt. We both just started laughing. It was almost like we were being punk'd or something. Waitress 2 later arrives with the card and we sign and go.\nRed hill really needs to work on its timing. The food was stellar, and I would like to one day return, but so many things went wrong. Please fix - the only reason this isn't a 1 star review is due to the quality of the food and the fact that they comped a dish.", "author": "Philip B."}

It was the second night the restaurant was open and it was buzzing!   The decor of the restaurant was cozy and warm and the staff very friendly.   For a restaurant newly opened the front of house staff was efficient, friendly, and very accomodating.    I had the Ceasar Salad and the halibut with tarragon, asparagus, shiitake mushrooms with fingerling potatoes and walnuts.     The Ceasar was yummy as other reviews have stated.   Chef Taylor use vegetables very nicely in his dishes.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and the walnuts added a nice texture to the dish.   I live in Santa Monica and visit SF from time to time and look forward to coming back next time I am in town! Big 5 star review!!   If you live in Bernal you are lucky!

We were a party of 9 and was placed in their separate dining area. We got to the restaurant a little earlier than the reserved time and were comfortably showed to our seating area.

I was a little nervous going there since some people complained on the Yelp bible ;) of not enough seafood in cioppino and too much noise in the room etc... but I ended up pleasantly surprised... It wasn't noisy at all; we were able to have an intimate conversation, lots of elbow space and the decor was charming without trying too hard. If I ever had any doubts about oysters, I have made my mind that night... I love them; good oysters really transport you to the beach and it is like having ocean in your mouth... in a good way ;)\nI had a trout for the main course and even though it was a relatively a simple rustic dish, I must admit it was delicious... you can't go wrong with sage pecan butter, you simply can't... \nMy husband was a little less excited about his carbonara; he complained it had too much bacon in it... he left half of the bacon on the plate... it was a heavy dose of bacon, that's for sure... I guess there is such a thing as too much of a good thing ;)\nThe bread, olive oil and balsamic, olives were all delicious. So was the desert: lace cookies with berries and whipped cream... simple but oh, so tasty... a big portion as well... :)\nI was very happy with my wine as well: a delicate French white...unfortunately half way through it, I ended up knocking my glass over and breaking it... :9  ...the waiter was very gracious about the clean up... he brought me another glass but at the end of the night my husband did get charged for it... it was a $15 glass of wine and even though I admit it was my fault, I hoped it would not show up on our bill... I did some research on it when I came home and it seems that opinions are split, even though most restaurant owners seem to believe that a good restaurant will absorb the breakage cost... It isn't really about the money but I feel it would be a nice gesture if it had been on the house. \nEither way, I will be back for the oysters and another glass of that overpriced French white ;)", "author": "ania w."}

The food was delicious and the service was also very good. We opted for wine pairings and we delighted with the expert doing the pouring as well as the wines. The portions were generous.

It allows you to see how gorgeous it is! It's so good you'll want to keep it for dipping. Grilled calamari with figs was scrumptious although they could put less dressing on the greens. Trout with almonds was perfectly cooked and served with seasonal vegetables and brown butter sauce. Oysters were served beautifully in what looked like a very large vintage french tureen. Bread is wonderful- be sure to ask for it as it is served with a small bowl of olives in what tasted like a olive oil, chopped garlic, and red pepper mix. Didn't stay for dessert because I'm not a fan of Mission Pie but I know others love it. So glad Red Hill is finally here!
