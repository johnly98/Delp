Lots of thrift and vintage stores to check out and many caf\u00e9s for my fellow caffeine addicts. I spent the majority of the day just wandering and looking at whatever seemed cool. A decent amount of homeless but none of them approach and definitely still kid-friendly. \n\nThe only negative... I have the bladder of a goldfish. So finding bathrooms is essential to my experience somewhere and i have some advice. If you stop at a cafe or restaurant and buy something, USE THE RESTROOM. Please don't convince yourself that you don't really have to go thaaatt bad (we've all done it). If you're a paying customer you've earned the right. If you happen to be withdrawing cash  and think \"hey maybe it's time to go here at the bank\" you're out of luck, no public bathroom. I ended up paying $7 for a drink I didn't need at Whole Foods where I was able to use the restroom. But... if you pay for the bathroom, maybe they should at least keep #2's off the ground? Just a quick warning, but besides the bathroom dilemma I loved the area and you will too.", "author": "Cara H."}

If you stand on that corner, you will see a clock set at 4:20. \n\nFor us locals growing up in the City, this is where we would get our ganja back in high school. Especially if my \"dealer\" was unavailable, we would have to trek here and choose who you could trust. Back in the day, it was like Wild Wild West and there were a lot of sellers to pick and choose from. It was either hit or miss so it was buyer beware. \n\nI'd prefer not to since the quality you would get was not consistent, and sometimes they would mix their products with real herbs instead of the alternative herb you were looking for. \n\nOne day, my \"dealer\" was out of town so my \"cousin\" and I were fiendin' to get faded. So we drove here, parked at McDonald's parking lot and started walkin' along Haight lookin' for a seller. We came upon a trio of \"sellers\" across the street from Amoeba. We asked for a dime bag and he said the price. I handed him a 50 and started giving me change straight from his wallet. It was obvious that he wasn't a professional and the guy was actually blazed as he was snickering counting the change. His two friends were also snickering and it was getting awkward real quick. \n\nAs he handed me all the cash, we made the exchange and we quickly hustled back to the car. As we got inside, we started counting the change and realized he gave me 50 back in 10's, 5's and singles. We started laughing and hauled ass just in case they realized their mistake. Anyway, the product wasn't the best we've had and it was dank at best.  \n\nNowadays, you can get them legally and I'm pretty certain the quality would be more consistent than how it was in the past. Also, they've cracked down on dealers over the years as it became more mainstream. \n\nThe neighborhood hasn't really changed much, but it has evolved into rows of vintage clothing stores, consignment stores, eateries, smoke shops, coffee shops, and homeless young adults looking for a place to fit in. I do miss the tattoo shop that made my bull tattoo, which sadly is no longer here. \n\nIt's part of the City that will always be unique and some stories that I would rather not share until I'm an old curmudgeon.", "author": "John G."}

A dream you dream together is reality.\" - John Lennon\n\nI'm blessed being a time traveler. I won't bore you on the details, but let's just say I've been here, there, and everywhere. Every decade and almost every century I have lived, through living my lives I'd say avoid the Dark Ages, every other period is tolerable, some more fabulous than others. \n\nI agree with some that today the Haight Ashbury is just not the same. Hmm well after deep thought what does that really mean? I mean was this a magical place at one time? Or was Timothy Leary full of bullshesh? No longer can you hear the Grateful Dead jamming in the house on the corner, or will you bump into a pre-cult Charles Manson. Forrest Gump was seen looking for Jenny, and SFPD was found everywhere cracking skulls too. \n\n\"Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.\"\n\nHmm so what is this place? A good place? A bad place? How about a little bit of both. And although there is a Haight Ashbury intersection, there's also the Haight Ashbury District. Guess what? I have first hand knowledge of Haight Ashbury because I lived just four blocks away on Clayton and Twin Peaks! So before you pilgrimage up here and expect free hippy love and everything is groovy... here's some Mary Jane & my 2-cents...\n\nThe BAD Haight Ashbury today:\n* The sidewalk needs to be washed. Seriously. \n* More & more overpriced t-shirt shops.\n* Loitering & being solicited. \n* Kids laying around now are lazy or sad to say many in need of intervention and help.\n\nThe GOOD Haight Ashbury today:\n* Those gems like Amoeba Music. Unique shops like Love of Ganesha, Loved to Death, etc. \n* The Grateful Dead House. The aura is real! \n* Golden Gate Park only steps away! \n* Read John Y.'s passionate review! He lived it! \n* The AMAZING history! \n\nAhh the history of Haight Ashbury is what separates it from just your typical intersection. This is where the counterculture was born and later challenged the authority. And in retrospect sometimes thinking outside-of-the-box and \"differently\" is what truly makes America great! \n\n\"Possession isn't nine-tenths of the law. It's nine-tenths of the problem.\"\n\nOk, it's 1969 again... pull up your bellbottoms, son. It was a happening place to be creative. The Jefferson Airplane jamming in one garage and the Grateful Dead in another. Hendrix and Janis Joplin strolls on by, even Harrison & Lennon was seen in the crowd. Bob Dylan lay lady laying across the street. Then you have the poets like Allen Ginsburg & Timothy Leary, the later who so happens to be Winona Ryder's Godfather, I know she's my ex;) The tied-dye psychedelic shirts and flowers in the hair enraged the authority, but only because the chaos was actually a wake up call for America to wake up! \n\n\"Love is the flower you've got to let grow.\"\n\nIn the end, the Haight Ashbury was never Nirvana or the stairway to Heaven. It was \"the place to be\" during a revolution against a war that probably shouldn't have happened. It was \"the place to be\" as creative as you wanted to be. It was \"the place to be\" to celebrate our freedom and remind ourselves how great America really is... if the people are given the power. Power to the people, right on! \n\n\"Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us, & the world will be as one.\"", "author": "Eric R."}

T Shirt Shops Galore with New Band T Shirts & Baseball Caps from their 60s heyday. There are also Vintage Shops on the street as well as New clothing stores. There are smoke shops & vinyl  record stores like Amoeba. There's a wide variety to eat; pizza, burger, coffee and ice cream shops abound. You might even see an original hippie or a millennial hippie walking  down the street. Lots of great people watching in this Mecca. People still play music on the street out of their van for tips. The corner of HAIGHT & ASHBURY where it all started says it all - it's now a Ben & Jerry's. Yup commercialism has hit, but Jimi Hendrix's apartment is still here. You'll also see wall murals of rock stars painted on the outside of buildings. So today & yesterday peacefully co-exist on the same street. Tourists love this area.

On our second day we took an Uber to the Haight district and there were people everywhere! This was on a Thursday morning at around 11am. There was a plethora of old, 60s wall paintings that took you back in time and scarves and unique things all hanging out of windows and draping here and there. It was really cool! Totally Hippie to the core. However, the wanna-be hippie/hipsters there these days ( other than us out-of-town tourists ) all seemed to be homeless and/or addicted heavily to drugs, or were just trying really really hard to look \"cool\", which was a far cry. I can see why George Harrison hated it to a certain extent. There really is a love-hate relationship with this place. My best friend and I had to turn down the offer of drugs numerous times. The stores were very cool, somewhat overpriced, but sold lots of the cute hippie memorabilia, magnets, t-shirts, mugs, etc. There were some lovely thrift stores that were super cheap which was surprising down in that area.

Many who could not find accommodation there turned to the quaint, relatively cheap and underpopulated Haight-Ashbury. The Summer of Love (1967), the 1960s era as a whole, and much of modern American counterculture have been synonymous with San Francisco and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood ever since.\n \nThe area is similar to what Granville used to be in the 90's and is grunge punk, alternative and 70's hippie with a commericial drive twist.\n \nInstead of doing the typical tourist thing we decided to take the BART @ $8 each and just walk around and do some exploring in a familiar throw back area with a culture that we were familiar with.\n \nHere are some yelp reviews of what Peter and I did in and around the area.", "author": "Shila B."}

Haight Street is easily accessible via public transport (MUNI bus). \n\nHaight-Ashbury is an eclectic, vibrant and interesting neighbourhood in SF with a unique, laid-back and hippie vibe. The neighbourhood has a lot of character and the main avenue, Haight Street, is lined with unique and independent local shops (smoke shops, vintage thrift shops, bookstores, music and movie stores, tattoo parlours and more), cafes, sidewalk markets, and lots of restaurants. Haight Street was crowded and there were lots of people walking the sidewalks in the afternoon. However, when we wandered off Haight onto the residential side streets, there was nobody else there and it was so peaceful, calm and quiet, which was great considering how close these areas were to the bustling and vibrant Haight Street itself. \n\nWe walked from Golden Gate Park and then continued along Haight Street towards Buena Vista Park. I enjoyed visiting the Haight Street Market, where I found a large variety and great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables. The most iconic intersection in the neighbourhood is that of the streets Haight and Ashbury. During the 1960s, this was the corner where the hippie counterculture movement comprised mostly of young people, would gather. What can now be found at this corner, is a clock attached to the corner of a building that is permanently set to the time 4:20. Also at this famous intersection, is a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop, where my mother and I sampled a delicious (but expensive) bowl of ice cream. \n\nWhile strolling down Haight Street, I loved checking out some of the many local and independent shops, that are completely unique to San Francisco and specifically, this street. I explored thrift shops selling vintage clothing and mementos, book stores and even a smoke shop (the young male cashier who sold me a SF magnet was completely high on drugs and could barely complete the transaction! It was hilarious to watch). I also enjoyed seeing some of the beautiful and colourful murals that were painted on the walls of buildings on some of the side streets stemming off of Haight. \n\nAlso along Haight Street sticking outside of a second floor window of one of the buildings, was fake female legs with fishnet stockings, looking like they were kicking the air! Very interesting indeed. \n\nI found the entire neighbourhood and the people living/walking around there, to be absolutely fascinating and very unique! The people-watching opportunities were abundant and fantastic and I observed many interesting characters (for example, two men walking down Haight Street completely naked and confident; a man singing very loudly on a street corner; young and homeless looking backpackers openly selling marijuana to passersby; people with hair colours that resembled the rainbow, and much more). There were quite a few homeless and substance-addicted individuals congregating on certain street corners along Haight, to the point where there was a strong police presence in some areas. But, I felt very safe wandering around this neighbourhood during the daytime. You will also probably notice the strong aroma of marijuana wafting around everywhere. If this bothers you, just be aware that this is what the Haight neighbourhood is like. \n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed venturing off of Haight Street and wandering through the residential side streets and neighbourhoods to admire the beautiful Victorian houses. The streets were very steep and walking almost vertically uphill was challenging, but it was worth it. The old houses were so pretty and painted in a wide variety of bright and beautiful colours, and they all had such unique and detailed architecture. My favourite row of houses was located on Central Avenue, just north of Haight. The colours were so bright, vibrant and beautiful! \n\nAfter exploring some of the residential areas, we discovered the gorgeous, peaceful and quiet Buena Vista Park. The park consisted of a huge hill, covered in dense foliage, with pathways spiraling up the hill to the top. My mother and I were the only people in the park during our afternoon visit, and I loved walking uphill through the forest in such a peaceful and calm atmosphere/environment! At the top of the hill, was a lookout area with a park bench and a clearing in the trees which overlooked the entire city! The panoramic views were absolutely incredible and I couldn't believe how high we were standing above the city. It was so amazing to be able to enjoy and savour the view in complete silence and being surrounded by such natural beauty. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience exploring Haight Street and the surrounding residential neighbourhood! It felt authentic.", "author": "Brittany T."}

That felt oddly disappointing (much like the first time I realized the corner of Haight and Ashbury had a Ben & Jerry's on it). Time marches on and never looks back, I guess. \n\nI do recommend visiting. Ignore all the talk denouncing going anywhere because tourists do it. Why even live in San Francisco, then? Inevitably tourists have rolled down every street just looking at houses. There's at least one worthwhile reason people flock to something, and you should find out on your own.\n\nHaight has more going for it than the Venice boardwalk, what with the indie bookshops, fresh produce markets, pricey vintage shops, restaurants, and galleries alongside the smoke shops, colorful murals, panhandlers, and occasional buskers.

We did this because we wanted to see the area on our way to golden gate park, parking is bad, and we didn't want to spend anymore time walking from store to store. \n\nAfter hearing raving reviews about this trendy, hip area, I was very disappointed. I didn't see anything that made me want to stop and stay. I saw a couple restaurants that looked neat, but no stores. The stores were mostly vintage stores, so if you're looking for that than this place is for you. \n\nMy opinion, it's worth driving by and seeing. Don't get your hopes up, it's just ok.

The majority of shops along Haight Street:\n*vintage clothing\n*toys and/or art \n*curio boutiques\n*smoke shops \nHaight Ashbury has some of the coolest, funkiest shops in the city, and there's interesting cafes and pubs tucked inbetween them. Grab a window seat and enjoy some awesome people-watching! Plus Haight Street runs into the beautiful Golden Gate Park... you can walk down one side of Haight, take a rest in the park, then hoof it back on the other side of the street. \nUnless you have a problem with shopping and/or street kids asking if you can spare a joint, Haight Ashbury is a fun touristy way to spend a day, and possibly a good chunk of your paycheck.

Here, although we would like to embrace the hippy cool, 'we love everyone' type of groove, it's not always so. If you're a business woman, who appears too well dressed, and talks on her cell phone as she walks, making appointments... people will tend to give you cold stares of 'WTH are you doing here woman! Get out before someone socks you in the face!' Well, this woman isn't me, but is my mum. My mum is actually quite sweet, and give her a chance, you'll see that she's just like the rest of us. Big sensitive babies, who just want to be accepted.\n\nThat's why I give the four stars, instead of the five. I really love this district. I came here many times during my life in SF. During high school especially, I'd walk from my home and just spend hours in this district. I loved the shopping at all the vintage and second hand stores. The delicious good eats found on every single block. The cool shoe stores, that would fit my love of high ass platforms. The tattoo shop, I took my brother to, when he turned 18. Back then, you needed an adult to accompany you, if you were under the age of 21. His tattoo was actually for free, because the dude told us we would be next, and we waited for lilke an hour, and he didn't have time to start on my brother. So he said if we came by tomorrow, the tattoo would be free. So we did come back, and the tattoo came out like a sea horse. I loved that it accidentally looked like a sea horse. Sea horses are cool creatures. The male carries the baby in his tummy! That's a world I'd like to live in some day. Fishes are such cool creatures.\n\nAnyhow, as you can see the Haight Ashbury carries many fond memories for me. Me and a few of my gal pals from Lowell High, would meet up on the weekends to explore the eclectic stores, and my best friend, Kristen and I, would go to the hair stores, and buy hair coloring kits, that we'd take back home to experiment... I tried so many colors during my high school years. Red, black black midnight, dark blue, light blue, magenta, red wine, light brown, blond...etc. Yup my hair coloring days are over, but it was fun back in the day. Even for my Lowell High School picture, I dyed my hair light smurf, bright blue. My other Korean classmates did the same, some coloring their hair red... we wanted to represent the Korean Flag.

The vibe is eclectic, free spirited, bohemian, independent, and unique. Yes, it was known for many years because of the Summer of Love, drugs and hippies. It's become a hodge-podge of ethnic restaurants- caribbean, mexican, thai, middle eastern, indian, etc., cafes (coffee), bars (nightlife), bookstore, boutiques, vintage stores and thrift shops (ooh).\n\nHere's what remains from when I shopped here as a teenager: The Wasteland (a tad overpriced), Villains (yup, same category), Buffalo Exchange (love love love this store- this location is what started my preference for this store; my brother's friend told me about this place), Goodwill ( we found a GPS holder NIB for $4.99), Aardvark's Odd Ark, Amoeba, and Recycled Records. I liked a cotton clothing store called Dharma, too but it's no longer there, oh well. \n\nThe ones that joined later on, that I really like are: Ben & Jerry's (they have the Vermonster here- for those of you who don't know this about me, I love ice cream, frozen yogurt, frozen custard, etc.- it is my dessert of choice, much like chocolate is to my husband, but no, I couldn't finish the Vermonster myself, are you crazy?), and Crossroads Trading Company (april/may 2010- found a plaid wheat colored Dooney & Bourke wristlet for $10, which retailed for $55- I went to the one at the Castro years ago; that's how I found about this one). \n\nI wanted to go into \"Held Over,\" but sometimes when you see the word Vintage, it screams \"expensive.\" At least, that's what it means sometimes in LV (The Attic). If you like doc martens (I still have three pairs that I wore when I was in college- they last forever, if you get sick of them, take them to Buffalo Exchange), check out John Fluevog's. If you like Stussy, you're in luck, there's a store here. There is much more than I mentioned, BTW. Pretty much something for everyone.\n\nAnyway, in restrospect, this is a unique colorful place as a whole, and I love the thrift stores, so I will always be back whenever I'm in town. Parking can be tricky (used to park on the side streets as a teen) but if you're lucky, you can find a spot with a meter and fill it with coins, as you might be a while browsing; my husband had to make a few trips there, had to be honest about that. \n\nYeah, part of the area (broken into two parts, but I really didn't go the entire length of the district as a teen) is gritty, might be dirty (every city's got 'em- the dirty part of LA, for example, is Hollywood Blvd.- gross), and homeless people are around the corner, but in all my years of shopping here (usually with my sister, best friend, and BF at the time), I've never had a problem with the people here- you see every type (goth, yuppie, druggies, free spirit, casual, families, singles, older, tourists, locals, etc.) here, for the most part, actually get along, gasp, imagine that.

This place is outstanding if you like to shop and have unique style. The fact that it may get really crowded at times might scare some away,but don't you do that. Some might say f-it because they can't find parking. Believe me  there is,just come early enough and you will find it. \n\nI love this nieghborhood,shops and all it has to offer.

Now it is mostly yuppy so that earthy vibe you may have heard about is muted quite a bit since many hippies turned into yuppies. Still it is an area of San Francisco that is worth going to and check out the cities history. I kind of felt the same way with the Castro District as well.
