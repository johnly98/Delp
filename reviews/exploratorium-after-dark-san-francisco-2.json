A hands-on experience museum with NO kids getting in your way and pushing all the freakin' buttons while you're still trying to read about the installation? YES, PUHLEASE. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate kids...all the time. I just hate them when they try to steal all the fun away. (Adults like pushing buttons and turning cranks too!) I also like that you can purchase booze inside. I feel like if drinking and learning was an option in school, there'd be more kids in the STEM. Or not. But it certainly would've made 9th grade physics more fun! Amiright?! \n\nDEFINITELY do the tactile dome! Yes, you have to pay extra, and yes, you should probably purchase it ahead of time (like, sometime Thursday morning), but it is SO WORTH IT. If you're on the fence, just ask yourself this: when was the last time you crawled around in complete darkness, feeling for furry walls, and sliding down into a pit of beans? If your answer was 'never' or 'more than 3 months ago', you definitely need to do it (again).

It's a mathematical artwork working in a pendulum motion, which is extremely mesmerizing. You can even make one yourself to take home, but tickets were sold out by the time we got there. I want one so damn bad! If there's ever a next time, that's the first thing I'm headed for.\n\nOverall, pretty cool spot for a date night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-01", "description": "Ever since I was a kid, the Exploratorium has been one of my favorite places in the city.  In school, coming here on field trips was the best.  As an adult though, coming here for dates is even better!  Especially for their After Dark events.  Getting to play with a bunch of fun exhibits with that girl (or guy) that you're into, all while enjoying a drink or two?  As Chandler Bing might say, could there BE a better date spot than this?\n\nNow, since this review is specifically for Exploratorium After Dark (as opposed to the Exploratorium itself), I'll limit this to just the event itself.  However, what I will say is that if you've never been, or if you haven't been since they moved out of the Palace of Fine Arts, you should definitely check out the place.  Not only is their new home gorgeous and modern, but the exhibits are equal parts interesting, educational, and, most importantly, fun!\n\nAs awesome as any trip to the Exploratorium is though, After Dark makes the experience just a bit better.  Held every Thursday from 6:00-10:00pm, it's an adults-only event with different themes and programs each week.  Since kids aren't allowed, you can walk around with alcoholic beverages and the crowd is smaller, older, and a lot more fun.  Sorry, kids are great and all, but it's a lot more relaxed/less stressful when you aren't surrounded and outnumbered by them!\n\nWith so many different exhibits to check out, you could easily spend all four hours exploring every nook and cranny of the place.  Especially the activities that require a partner (didn't I say this was a fun date spot?).  However, if After Dark did have a flaw, it's that there aren't many \"bars\" (we only saw one, other than the cafe).  Not a major thing, but kind of funny considering how the Academy of Science's adults-only event, Nightlife, had a bar in nearly every corner.\n\nRegardless of whether you're coming here for a date or not though, After Dark is a fantastic way to spend a Thursday night and/or to finally make your way here.  In part because it's also far cheaper than going during the Exploratorium's regular hours.  Except on the handful of dates every year when admission is free, both the tickets to get in ($15 for After Dark, $29.95 for general admission), as well as the Tactile Dome ($10 vs $15), cost notably less.  And what better way to spend those savings than on getting cozy with another round of drinks?  ;)\n\nCheers!", "author": "Mike L."}

They knew they had a huge enough draw in interactive museums for adults who don't always want to be surrounded by loud kids, so they set up a program where only adults get to have the fun. It's a hit. My girlfriend and I have done both the Exploratorium and the Academy After Dark now, and the Exploratorium is definitely the winner. From special talks and exhibits surrounding a different theme every week (ours was space-themed last night) to fanciful cocktails, the Exploratorium After Dark reminds you why you loved science as a kid, and the place will keep you happy and fascinated for hours. Great date night. Great night overall. Oh, and the huge cardboard exhibit where you get to sit on the \"Iron Throne\", reimagined in cardboard? Win.", "author": "Danny C."}

The last time I went, it was years ago when it was located at the Palace of Fine Arts, so this was a treat. We all met up last Thursday, October 29th around 6:30pm.\n\nThe views of the bay are amazing! Thanks Rodney H for showing us the outside patio upstairs. Lots of photo ops. Perfect to share with a significant other or a good friend. They also have benches in front of giant glass windows where you can enjoy the views from inside if it's a little too chilly outside.\n\nNow to me, the point of going to After Dark is the liquor! I've been to the Cal Academy of Sciences for their version of this and I remember there were bars everywhere! I never had to wait long for a drink. This was the only thing I found lacking at After Dark. We'd have to search for a bar and then there was always a line. It took a good 15 mins to grab a drink. They provided a good array of spirits: Hanger 1 vodka, Rhum barbancourt rum, Pueblo viejo tequila, Great king street blended scotch whisky and Blade gin. I stuck with the Four roses bourbon. They also offered beer and wine.\n\nThe exhibits always appeal to my inner child. Whether it be something I can play with or just an interesting educational display, it's always fun walking around and seeing what appeals to me. I especially liked the Illuminated fog, Geysers, Giant mirror, Colored shadows, Slinky trampoline and Scott Weaver's Toothpick sculpture. The giant mirror kept us entertained for quite some time as it was super trippy walking around in front of it. Bobby L showed his skills with the slinky trampoline. When none of us could do it for longer than 5-10 seconds, Bobby made it go on forever. The toothpick sculpture is impressive as well. It took the artist 40 years to make it, but he recently added his face to the sculpture. It was frustrating for some to find, but I found the whole process amusing. You should drop by to see if you can find it.\n\nAs always, I had a great time at the Exploratorium. Even more so with a little liquor. Now if they could just work on having more bars. I'd be able to quench my thirst more often!", "author": "Elena N."}

I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I was amazed at the sheer size of the exploratorium and that everything in the museum was interactive! I had to have walked through the exhibits at least 3 times and kept finding more things to watch/ do. My only regret is not having a friend to do the group activities with! Will definitely be back.

The combination of these things create a great atmosphere as if we were transported to some adult playground where jobs and other responsibilities don't matter.\n\nThat being said, there were a LOT of drunk adults and it felt chaotic and crowded at times. There was a wait for most activities (not too long and people were nice about it) but I did not like how messy and dirty it got. Wish they had people who were there to clean up because it got downright GRIMY. \n\nThe night I went with my friend the fire alarm went off and we had to wait outside for about 30 ish minutes, which took away some of our time. It would have been nice if they gave us a little coupon for next time or extended hours but we ended up not being able to try out all the activities due to lack of time.\n\nAdmission is $15 and the tactile room is extra so you would think alcohol prices would be decent. Well you thought wrong. Seriously. $12 for a shot? Is this Vegas?\n\nRegardless of any messiness and expensive alcohol prices, I had lots of innocent alcohol-infused fun!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-08", "description": "I have attended the NightLife events at Cal Acad and was excited to see what After Dark would be like. I actually haven't been to the new location until now. I went to the photography themed event last night and bought my ticket through Citi rewards but didn't know I had to print out a copy for the Exploratorium to keep (I didn't read the small text, my fault). So, I had to deal with that for a little bit at the ticketing desk. Staff was helpful and we got everything resolved! My friend and I arrived a bit after 7 so I was anxious to get in ASAP.\n\nFinally walked in and immediately hit up a bar. Canned beer is $5, cocktails $9 and wine for... I don't know haha. I got an Oskar Blues Old Chub and a Maui Big Swell IPA during my night. Prices are fairly affordable for such an event. Bars were in abundance! They weren't hard to locate either - and we were provided with a map if we needed help. The smaller looking bars seemed to be cash only, and the larger ones took both card and cash.\n\nThe event was busy but it wasn't uncomfortably crowded, which I was actually expecting it to be like. A group of ladies was there for a bachelorette party which I thought was such a great idea. There were a bunch of exhibits to explore and I definitely was not able to cover all of them! My favorite was the Living Systems areas, as I like the natural sciences, and also the phone/safe exhibit! There were a few talks going on and some activities that we didn't make it to in time. But we were able to attend the cow eye dissection! My friend and I were able to interact with a lot of the exhibits. \n\nWe hadn't had dinner yet (drinking on an empty stomach, you know that feel) so we decided to check out what they had available. I don't know if there were any other stations but we found the main dining area. They were already sold out of tacos, which looked like the best dish. The prices were in the teens... which I kinda expected but also didn't considering that the drinks were affordable.\n\nAfter exploring a bit more, I noticed that the fire alarm was going off! No one was making a big deal yet so we started walking around again. A staff member near us began to tell patrons to make our way to the nearest exit. Everyone, including staff, was calm and cooperative. We stood outside for a bit until we were told to make our way towards the Embarcadero. Firetrucks arrived shortly after (so fast!) and then we were told the Exploratorium was now closed for the night. It was about 9:45 so the event would have ended in 15 minutes anyway. \n\nKinda sad we had to leave a little early but we still enjoyed After Dark. Good event for groups and dates - similar concept as NightLife except obviously in a different kind of museum. The crowd at After Dark actually seemed a little older than the ones I've seen at NightLife - I assume it's possibly because NightLife usually hosts DJs and musical guests. I'm not sure if After Dark has hosted live music before, but if they did, that would be cool too. I hope to be back to experience another theme - photography was cool but not really of my interest. Sooooo, I love drinking and I love museums - put the two together and I'm there!", "author": "Shanise M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-04", "description": "Came here after seeing their event page on Facebook for After Dark: Glow. The pictures on the page made it look like it would be a lot of fun with LOTS of lights/blacklights/neons/glowsticks kinda like a mini-rave! I did some research on it and was excited to see a whole list of exhibits/installations/demonstrations; I was intrigued by the \"glowing bubbles\" activity... O__O\n\nFrom 6PM-10PM on certain Thursdays, Exploratorium After Dark mimics California Academy of Sciences' Nightlife (But really, who started it first?? Don't know, don't mind) in that they close off the museum to only adults 21+, serve alcohol at bars strewn around the museum, and play music. However, it seemed a lot more ~quiet~ than Cal Academy's Nightlife in that the Exploratorium's music only seemed to be playing in one area. Looking back on it, it's understandable as a lot of exhibits require listening/concentrating. The SO and I actually didn't get any drinks that night since EVERY bar had a long ass line of people, and I counted at least 4 bars around the place... maybe they need more! We really did enjoy that there were essentially less people (aka no kids! :D), which made it easier to check out some exhibits we couldn't before. For example, we were actually finally able to tinker around with that wall with the holes where you connect the thingamajigs to make the marble travel as slow as possible, only we tried to make it travel at top speed. That was fun. \n\nOnto some highlights: \n\n1. We were able to catch one or two magic tricks by this guy at one of the booths. He was really good and was very interactive with the audience. \n2. Monochrome room: there was a candy machine full of jelly beans all sepia-toned until you flash a flashlight on it. The SO was able to grab like three mounds of jellybeans to eat... dummy lol \n3. The dry ice exhibit in the landscapes area was super cool. I could have sat and watched those things swim about all night. Check it out!\n4. The Social Behavior area was probably the most interesting to me. Definitely a cool place to learn about someone when you're on that first date haha... Trust me, I know... :T But that story's for another time! \n5. The Light Orchestra was cool to look at from afar. We saw a girl going HAM all up on it, really making the installation dance. \n\nSome lowlights (in regards to the \"theme\" for the night):\n1. The glowing bubble activity was basically a dark room with a blacklight and people not really doing anything. It also seemed really messy, so it was mainly the workers doing the bubble blowing and those brave souls who dipped their hands in the bubble solution and clapping their hands to create a colorful explosion. The SO pointed out \"wow this is just like one of those hotel rooms\" when we saw all the hand prints and streaks of neon on the walls hahahaha we nope'd out there pretty quick but since our way out was also the way in, people coming in didn't care and just kept filing in while we waited for a chance to push through... really? \n2. Though there were a bunch of exhibits about light, I was hoping that After Dark as a whole would be a little more upbeat. It wasn't the mini-rave I thought it would be in my head. STILL, the Exploratorium was extremely fun (especially without kids running around) and the SO and I learned so much, we burnt out by almost 9PM. Even then, we didn't check out ALL the experiments. \n\nOverall, for the $15 ticket price (about half price of general admission during regular hours and about $3 more than at Cal Academy), the Exploratorium After Dark events are totally worth going. It's definitely a great place to take a date and explore together. I love that there's so much hands-on activity going on in this place, heh heh.", "author": "Leslie Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-16", "description": "Exploratorium After Dark is pretty similar to Nightlife at the CA Academy of Sciences.  It's 21 and over only, most of the exhibits are open, and there are bars located throughout the museum.  It's one of the few times where you can go to the rooftop outside the conservatory and enjoy a lovely view of the bay.\n\nLike Nightlife, it's a nice change of pace to visit with an adults only crowd without kids running around and fighting for the exhibits.  Though even though it's an older crowd, sometimes you'll have to end up waiting in line for some of the popular exhibits.\n\nOne nice thing is that Seaglass Restaurant is conveniently open during this time if you need some food, since there aren't too many food options around.  The food is decent, but priced at a premium though.\n\nIf you haven't been to the Exploratorium, simply because of the busy weekend crowd, Exploratorium After Dark is a great way to get acquainted with the museum.  It's $15 for After Dark, which is actually much cheaper than going during general admission hours at $29.  And similar to what I said in my earlier review of The Exploratorium, even though you'll be with a more adult crowd, when you're tinkering around with the exhibit, you'll simply feel like a kid again.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Hit the bar areas early (the drink costs are about right for an adults-only evening), get your glow on, let your hair down, and be uninhibited for the evening.

If you like going to the Academy of Science's NightLife event, then you'll definitely like this one.\n\nAfter Dark is a great way to explore this museum as an adult.  It can get overwhelming as there is so much to do!  But the event lasts for 4 hours so if you're not going to any of the special demonstrations, you can easily pace yourself.  But if you've been before, then I say enjoy the exhibits and atmosphere!\n\nThe drinks are around $5-$9, and there were only 2 food stations when I went (steamed pork buns for $3 each and shrimp tostadas for $5 each).

I was happily surprised that the After Dark programming was geared towards adults, while using the usual displays. It was pretty crowded. There is usually a few people in front at every display, but they moved on fairly quickly, so I was able to see the display. I kept losing my friends and bumping into people though. There is a lot to see. \n\nI wish they published that night's program earlier or online so I can plan out my visit better. There were a lot of shows and discussions that I was pretty overwhelmed and didn't really know where to start. \n\nDrinks were pretty expensive.

The booze helps, too. (This is also what's great about the Cal Academy's NightLife, though that's 21+)\n\nSometimes there are maps, which help tremendously. I wish they'd offer those all the time, or post floor plans in each wing to orient visitors (I did see a couple signs with arrows, but not maps or at obvious junctions). \n\nIt seems there are two very different After Dark experiences: \n-1st Thursdays of the month, which are heavily marketed, have partners presenting demos around a theme, and are pretty crowded, and:\n-other Thursdays, which are not themed and while still lively and have in-house demos, are not very crowded at all. \n\nPros:\n-no kids = no guilt for playing with the interactive exhibits. \n-is 18+ (so I can bring my sub-21 coworkers)\n-live demos and friendly staff. One station was dissecting a cow eye last night!\n-enormous, so I can go multiple times and see new stuff/skip stuff I find less interesting but still feel I got my money's worth. It also seems they change some things out pretty regularly.\n\nCons:\n-group tickets aren't individually printed, so you have to arrive together or have someone with the ticket meet them at the door. \n-food is pricey, without a ton of variety. Filling, though. \n-hard to prioritize what you want to see without a map. \n-enormous, so you won't be able to see everything in one evening/would get tired or overstimulated spending the entire 4 hours trying to do it all.", "author": "Krista L."}

Cool exhibits and booze, cannot beat that. So my boyfriend and I said we would check it out.\n\nWe totally failed and didn't manage our time well, we got to the pier after 8pm to traffic and it was raining. *darn. BUT because we were in a bit of a rush, we did not bother checking for surround parking lots, we found street parking within yards of the museum entrance. *score! Since this is happening at night and the event was well in full swing, less likely chance of people fighting over parking spots.\nInitially walking into the main entrance, you're not really sure what to expect your first time in. I vaguely remember the setup at Palace of Fine Arts, so I was wondering how they could set this up on the pier. as soon as you walk into Gallery one (of 5) just surrounded and overwhelmed with intriguing exhibits. Each Gallery has a theme. Sight and sound, tinkering objects, wild life, etc.\nContinuing into the museum, it opens up and give you an idea of how massive the space is. there's work shops, labs and offices opened up for display for visitors where the contributing staff, during the day, openly work. Each exhibit has instruction on how to properly use whats available to use and an explanation as to what you may be looking for to happen. So if yoh do not want to read, this place is NOT for you.\nI am not one for science but this place is so damn cool. I would spend hours on end to try and absorb the information that good be attained here.

I'd had the Exploratorium on my list of things to do since I moved to the Bay area and finding out about the late night events seemed like the perfect excuse to go.\n\nI went with a meetup group and my boyfriend tagged along at the last minute.  It was a great experience on both fronts and I'd definitely suggest this as a date night or just friends' night out.  I loved getting the chance to explore the exhibits without any inhibitions that come with being a 'grown-up' and was so excited to see most all the other attendees took part as well.  There were so many instances of strangers working together to solve (or compete) in various exhibits as well as laughing together when things went not quite as expected.  \n\nWe got there around 6:30 and walked right in with our pre-purchased tickets (you can just show them on your phone even though they say print them out).  We stayed until closing, and I still feel like we didn't get through all the exhibits, so it definitely leaves more to explore if you'd like to go more than once. \n\nThe only negatives were that I wish the talks were a bit more regulated/varied and that there were better food options.  We hung out at the restaurant bar for a bit and chatted with a few people and no one seemed really impressed by the (rather expensive) food.  The night we went, there was a talk on fermentation that turned out to be really interesting, but there were tons of people there so it seemed rushed and disorganized. I almost wish they had some sort of limit on people for the talks.  Also, I haven't been really impressed with their upcoming line up on the talks, they seem to be filling in gaps with random things now that they're having the event weekly.  They don't really match up to the quality of the Cal Academy evening events.

The \"After Dark\" event is a must-attend for anyone who's even mildly interested in science, drinking, how interesting phenomena work, or all of the above. \n\nLocation/Atmosphere-5/5. First of all, I love the Embarcadero, and how unapologetic-ally tourist-friendly it is. The museum itself has an amazing layout. It's  modern and open, dimly lit to emphasize the exhibits, and easy to walk though. Every 15 inches or so there's an exhibit to look at, touch, and experience. I've gone twice to this event and haven't managed to see every exhibit. If you make it to the back of the museum, there's a trendy bar, SeaGlass Restaurant. The decision to have Exploratorium After Dark be adults-only is brilliant. Why go to a regular bar when you could go to a top-notch museum that effectively functions as a bar? The no-kids policy gives it a nice vibe, and makes it a \"safe space\" for grown-ups to walk around buzzedly and examine earthly marvels in wonder without having to worry about being impolite if you're blocking a 7 year old's view of the cloud chamber. \n\nExhibits-5/5. My favorite wing is the Living Systems gallery; I'm consistently blown away by live chicken embryos, touch-sensitive plants, algal mats, and giant logs. Upstairs there is a Landscape gallery that has a fog machine, cloud chamber, rift machine,  and even more..The cloud chamber was amazing; you can see alpha radiation from the decaying lead on the brass rod in the middle of the chamber. I also love the Central Gallery, with exhibits on diffraction and other light phenomena. \n\nFood/Drink-3/5. The first time we went we had Mahi Mahi tacos and Papas Bravas to eat; they were very flavorful and delicious. The drinks were a great selection and reasonably priced, as well! The second time we went my friend and I actually both got ill from our food--vegan chili--which was unfortunate. We were both sick for a day after attending.

I was planning to have a drink or two but refrained due to the long lines. Prices seemed high for small amounts of drinks. Otherwise, great atmosphere.

I did both before. The price is cheaper and there are slightly less people. Yelpers on here are complaining that $15 dollars is expensive for admission. I think it is cheap, you have to pay $18(student discount) and $25(adult) on regular days. Even compared to academy of science $24(adult regular hours); this is considered a bargain. I rather pay this than the same for a cover at a seedy club any day. Quit yer yappin. \n\nThe exploratorium is a great two story science museum, and all the exhibits open at the day time are also open at night. So you get the full experience being here. There are tables where you can buy alcohol, but I don't suggest it. The drinks, both bottled and cocktail, are very expensive $5-10 and aren't very good quality. I didn't see alot of people buying it. And just because they serve drinks, this is not the place to get sh*tfaced. People here are having good clean adult fun. I had alot of fun playing with all the displays and just hanging out with my buddies here. The crowd is mixed with all ethnicities and age range of 21-50. Most people were 20s and 30s though. \n\nAside from the great exhibits, you can go outside to the deck and have a great view of the ocean and bay bridge. Because the exploratorium is on the pier, you are right on top of the water. There is also an outdoor observation area on the second floor. \n\nOnce you are done here, you can try the great night life and restaurants within walking distance.", "author": "Cecile S."}

The new campus along the waterfront is longer, but not as tall, allowing you and your guests to drink in the science slowly instead of sucking the science fire hose.\n\nBut everything you loved about the old Exploratorium is still here! The toilet fountain, the hanging piano, the interactive playthings, and the great demos. We popped by for Sexplorations, and I was impressed with how cranially-focused and thought-provoking the entire arrangement turned out to be. They challenged and amazed the audience with a variety of tactile presentations that drew in capacity crowds, or let you play all over the multitude of exhibits (some of which I remember from visiting as a kid). \n\nThe new campus is way closer to the city, making it a lot more accessible for visitors and city-dwellers alike. My one gripe is that the new thinner design did lead to more choke points as crowds tried to worm their way through the museum. Beyond that, this is a great evening for you and your playful friends.

I really am a fan.\n\nThe first Thursday of every month, the Exporatorium holds a playground for the 18 and over.  The Exploratorium was pretty fun to begin with, but when they add alcohol it gets even better.  The festivities begin at 6:00 and end at 10:00.\n\nParking sucks.  They have a tiny lot out front that is immediately packed, regardless of how early you arrive.  They have a much larger lot that is a ways away from the entrance and is poorly lit.  I swear we almost hit someone before.  At the February event the lot was closed and we had to park across the street.\n\nEach month showcases a different topic.  January was \"Chill\", focusing on the art of relaxing.  We got there a little late and didn't really get to participate in the featured events, but we still had fun walking around and playing with the stuff they had there.  There are a million photo opportunities there.  We spent a while right up front playing with the bubble wall and the water drop photospeed demo.  Everything is interactive.\n\nFebruary was \"Surrealism\".  If you dressed up as your favorite surrealist you got a discount.  There were quite a few people dressed up.  The biggest event that night was the Alice in Wonderland Tea Party and characters walking around.  It's fun, even when you're sober.\n\nIf you are planning on going to more than one event, I would suggest buying the annual pass.  To go to one event it costs $15.  The annual pass is only $30.  I've already gotten my money's worth by going to two events, and I still plan on going to more.\n\nThe gift shop has a bunch of fun stuff to play with, too.  If you have an annual pass you get a discount on any merch.  There isn't much to eat there.  They have a cafeteria, but the food is limited and looks like it's been sitting there for a while.  The specialty drinks are STRANGE. We had the drink thats a beer and a shot and it was pretty horrible.  I don't suggest it.\n\nI think this place is a great DATE place.  Especially if it's a first date.  There's a lot to play around with so it's never a quiet moment, alcohol if you're a little shy, and it ends early enough that if the date isn't going well, you can bail.  If it's going great, you can move it to a good late night dinner place and see where that goes.", "author": "Richard N."}

The terrace has a open balcony with the view of the Bay Bridge! I think it'll take more than two to three hours to finish going through everything--it took me two hours to walk through both wings, but I selectively check out some and not all exhibits. \n\nParking is pretty convenient, there is a parking lot across the street but charges $15/hr after hours.

I got there at 7, and it was kind of dead... but it started to pick up around 8! So if you want to play with some of the exhibits, I suggest getting there early so you can 1. get parking and 2. play with exhibits without people hustlin you to hurry up. Haha. But even if you come later, you still have time to play with the exhibits and find parking in the residential areas. SO no worries.\n\nAlright if you aren't a Physics nerd like me, I think the exhibits are just fun to just play around with. It's interesting since I have no idea what the concept behind each one is. There are placards with information on why... but I just skimmed it. Haha. I'm there to have fun, not really learn. But if you're interesting behind the concepts of it, then read away!\n\nSo every After Dark is themed... I went to the heartworks one that happened last night, and it was fun. Hearts all over and you can make your very own secret encoded QR tag. I still don't know what it is, but its that square bar code thing. There are scavenger hunts and did I mention always a new activity to do at each After Dark. It's just nice to look around. \n\nThis is an 18+ event, and 21 to drink. So there are no kids hogging up the exhibits or running around the museum. Pretty nice if you ask me. I don't have to worry about walking into strollers or wait for kids to be done playing with an exhibit, since some can take forever!

Although a little crowded and it seems as though they tend to place exhibits in a random fashion in the building; nonetheless you'll find a section that you can't leave.  The ExplOratorium is always fun because you get to experiment on your own.  They've brought over a few exhibits from the old exploratorium which is nice because the experience becomes a bit nostalgic for those who remember the old one.  After Dark opens every first Thursday of the month which explains the crowdedness.  Come early if you plan to seek out the exhibits.  We watched a show about the history of rap which blew my mind and there was also a break-dancing crew battling it out in the courtyard last week.  It's nice that there is an outdoor space and a segregated cafeteria.  It's easy to navigate through the building.  I enjoyed the fog bridge concept because it really encompasses all that is San Francisco during the summer.  The line for drinks can get pretty long.  Again, the earlier you make it in, the less crowded it is as you make your way through.\n\nSince this site is located at around Pier 15-17 on the Embarcadero, you can opt to take public transportation (BART, Muni) or park in the outdoor lots.  There is also validation for discounted parking in the Embarcadero shopping centers.  Even though it can get a little tough to get to this location, there is a reason it's on the Embarcadero.  From the observatory you can see the Bay Bridge lights and the city skyline upclose.

I have to say, the crowds really did detract from my experience here. Parking was a bitch (though to be expected for SF, even after dark), the exhibits were crowded, the film viewings filled up, and the lines for cocktails were way too long. As a result, we didn't view any films, drink any cocktails, or watch any demonstrations.\n\nI did like the idea of the exhibits. They had a salt booth teaching the differences in various salts, a nitrogen ice cream booth, one for teaching knife technique, a tofu- and cheese-making demonstration, and one for making caviar out of jelly. There was one demonstration about taste buds and nerves that I really enjoyed. They brought sweet-blockers and sour-blockers, along with various sweet and sour items (lemons, twizzlers, sugar packets, preserved mango) to experience.

We were met at the door by a smiling, but rather mean girl who was very pleased to give us a lecture on all the mistakes we had made by not coming earlier or buying tickets online in advance.  She said you should come back next week...  Well, I do not live in SF, spent $75 on a zipcar and two hours driving through traffic to get there, and brought an out of town guest who lives over 2000 miles away and will not be here \"next week\" when we are supposed to do everything right so we can be allowed in.  Very poor customer service!!  Also, as far as I can tell the next event is not next week but next *month*!\n\nIt turned out the store was not restricted entry, and we could go in there.  We could have also walked around the new building to check it out.  Neither of these activities were suggested by the Exploratorium employee, despite her lengthy lecture to us on how we did everything wrong.  A better approach would have been to say \"I'm really sorry I can't let any more people in tonight, please come back and visit us tomorrow.  Here's a brochure about next month's After Dark event.  You can still visit our store and take a walk around the building\"  Even better would be selling more tickets!  More tickets = more money for the Exploratorium, more happy people, and common sense.  After all, a lot of people were leaving, so there was no way the space was at maximum capacity. \n\nOverall, this was a horrible experience.  This is a poorly run/managed event and the staff members are not at all well trained in empathy or customer service.  We were treated like naughty children, not like valued customers or welcome visitors.   \nIt might be a fun event if you jump through the website hoops, or skip dinner and show up at 5:30 to get in line for a ticket.  I'm not very eager to find out anymore though.\n\nNote:  This is a very bad event to attend if you are easily stressed out, don't like massive crowds, or suffer from sensory overload issues.  As other reviewers have noted, parking is also a disaster ~ the \"official\" parking lot (~$5/hr) was closed and full and there aren't a lot of other options at any price.", "author": "N T."}

It was nice to do an \"adult\" night, and actually try the stuff out for yourself- however I must have picked a popular night. The gastronomy definitely drew in the foodie crowd and boy was it ever crowded. Exploratorium didn't seem to worry much about capacity but it was too crowded to actually try many of the exhibits, old or new. There were just too many people and the lines were very long. A lot of the special booths ran out of food samples before the lines finished. It doesn't seem like an easy place to start random conversations or meet people either. People are already in groups or on dates and are preoccupied with the exhibits. \nI do have to give the Exploratorium some credit for giving a student discount, even Cal Academy doesn't do that in the evenings.\nSome of the old exhibits are just as fun as I remembered when I was a kid. I saw some ad about them relocating to another space- I hope they don't get pushed out. This is a classic. \nThe one take home lesson that you can actually do (since most of us don't have easy access to liquid nitrogen, etc) is wine + blender = hyperdecantation (decanted faster and tastier!)

A group of friends and I decided to check it out as it's been on our list of things to do for quite some time now. All of the exhibits/pieces were really interesting to interact with.

This is a great place for a group of friends or a date. There's always something to talk about when walking around here.\n\nParking was easy. We arrived around 6:30 or so and found a spot a small walk away from the entrance.

Some kind of audio system - the presenter should have a microphone.  \n3. Any visual things - like monitors - should be where everyone can see them, not just the 4 people in front.\n\nI'm not the only one who was frustrated.

The lines were long but that's to be expected when a museum first opens... \n\nPros:\nThe outdoor space is lovely and my kiddo enjoyed crawling around the gyroid structure at the entrance. \nThe staff - as always - were really helpful and friendly. \nThe restaurant food was absolutely delicious and we enjoyed being able to eat outside right on the water. We had the pizza, fruit salad, milk (and a cookie for the little one). The price wasn't as bad as I thought it would be - around $16 for all of it, and the server even served up extra banana slices for us when my son mentioned he loved them.\nHands on. This is truly a hands on museum. Nothing holds a toddler's attention for long but this place comes close!\n\nCons:\nI was a little surprised that many of the exhibits were the same ones from the old location - though there were a lot of new ones too. \nThe restaurant trays weren't big enough to fit two plates.\n$25 tickets - yikes. Glad they have free days here.\nLimited/bad signage. The first thing I noticed walking in was the arrow on the \"enter here\" sign was tiny. People with tickets were waiting in the really long \"to purchase\" line because we were unsure where to go. Inside, it was hard to track down bathrooms and there were little to no signs letting us know where to find food.\nIt's shocking how many parents are oblivious to the lines forming behind their children playing with one of the exhibits. What ever happened to the taking turns rule? (This is really a parent-related complaint though I wonder if having more staffers at the popular exhibits moving people along would help each kid feel like they have a turn.)\n\nCan't wait to try the place out again on a day that isn't so crowded!", "author": "Christina K."}

There is a ton of interactive stuff, some more fun than others, but all pretty educational in one way or another. Some of the displays/activities seemed like they were a bit worn down though. But you definitely get to feel like a kid as you wander around exploring the different exhibits. \n\nCome with a friend, a honey, or a group - it's easy to split off and then find each other again later. There's a lot of tactile things so if you are a germaphobe,  you will be reaaaallly uncomfortable. I definitely had to wash my hands afterwards - they felt grimey. \n\nParking is free and pretty easy when we arrived around 6:30ish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-03", "description": "I decided to start a new Yelp listing for the \"Exploratorium After Dark\" event because it's such a different experience from the regular daytime Exploratorium. Reviews of it in the regular Exploratorium section would just get lost, and very likely confuse parents who are looking for information about the hands-on science museum in preparation for taking their kiddies there. Parents: keep right on looking. This isn't for you.\n\nNo, Exploratorium After Dark is a totally different experience. It's more like the \"Matcha\" events that the Asian Art Museum hosts or the ArtPoint ones at the deYoung / Legion of Honor. Imagine the Exploratorium being open at night, with the vast majority of people being stylish couples and singles in their 20s through 40s (and only a handful of children in attendance), two full bars, good music (everything from old Bowie to the Decemberists) piped at a nice low level throughout, the conspicuous lack of the din of shrieking children, and  s p a c e   t o   s p a r e ! How unlike the Exploratorium is THAT?!\n\nInstead of having to wait to use the more popular exhibits, there are no lines. Instead of being rattled by crowds of shouting pre-teens and their harried chaperons, you can stroll around with room to spare, with a glass of wine and a nice buzz. And as a bonus, the Tactile Dome (normally ridiculously overpriced at $20) is just $5, which is what it should always cost (but doesn't). Call me strange, but I somehow prefer crawling around in the dark with attractive adults after a couple of drinks, rather than with hyperactive 4th graders.\n\n\"Exploratorium After Dark\" happens the first Thursday night of every month, from 6pm until 10pm. It's only open to members (or those who buy \"Exploratorium After Dark\" passes), and you must be at least 18. Beer is $5, wine is $6, and mixed cocktails are $7; a little pricey, but how else are you going to be able to drink while operating dangerous electromechanical machinery in a museum setting?\n\nFor stylish adult science geeks, \"Exploratorium After Dark\" is nirvana.", "author": "Curran H."}

It's amazing. It's like a drunken trip down memory lane. The boy and I walked around outside and climbed one of the structures to drink a few brewskies before going in, because we'd heard the drinks are pricey and we're young lovers on a budget...good plan! once inside we decided to splurge and get the specialty cocktail which advertised a splash of absinthe. \n\nWell, that was probably dumb, but we were drawn in by the enticing idea of having absinthe in a science museum. It was tasty, but it was very weak and tasted mostly like sprite and lemonade with a \"mist\" of absinthey licoricey taste on top. So yeah, I would recommend going with your staple mix drink, wine or beer to get the most for your money.\n\nOne thing I have to mention in the tactile dome. IT IS A MUST DO. I don't think I'm very easily freak-out-able, but the first few minutes of total visual deprivation were intense, heart pounding and TOTALLY AWESOME. Tip: wear socks, cuz you can't wear shoes.

I was intrigued at the Exploratorium version primarily because I don't have to sit on BART + Muni for a significant amount of time to be able to drink in a museum! It is a quick 10 minute walk from the Embarcadero BART station. \n\nThe idea of this museum is great--a hands-on approach to teaching people, primarily kids, science and how it works. I don't think that it works too well in a 21+ adults only type setting mainly because if you aren't at an exhibit or demonstration, you can't really be doing much else. Also since it is a kid's museum, there are lots of things that are meant for small people. Very awkward for the tall people and girls dressed in club heels. The big bar near the entrance has 2 bartenders--one who is cash only and one who takes credit. Not sure if it is like this every time but the long line went by very quickly. Mixed drinks/wine were $9, and specialty beers were $5. There were not really food options unless you eat at the pricey restaurant inside or the $13 sandwiches from a vendor in the outside area (at least Cal Academy has cheap food options as well as expensive). The highlight of the evening was views of SF, the Bridge, and East Bay from the second floor outdoor area. Also it was fun to watch people from above. The outside wharf area of the building has a sculpture that you can climb. Kudos to them for providing a ton of options for seating around the whole space if you aren't lucky enough to participate in the exhibits inside.\n\nI probably will not go out of my way to come back here again like I do for Nightlife at Cal Academy or Off the Grid at Oakland Museum (tickets are $6!!!!!). Many other museums offer similar 21+ events and although this cost few bucks more, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. I guess it costs more because its a bigger space with a ton of exhibits inside. Who knows. But... nice try.\n\n\nAlso it was sad to see the signs taped up all over the place that said \"This exhibit was created by someone who is about to be laid off.\"", "author": "Mary K."}

A lot of the exhibits were just a refresh of the things that we've all been taught in grade school .. Explanations of optical illusions, how our eyeballs work, and color play just to name a few. There were also experiments to engage in with a partner such as a lie detector and a \"gut instinct\" test, as well as talking to each other from across the room (pretty darn amazing!)

Not so much.\n\nWe opted for the foods at the food court and I have to say that it is absolutely not worth it at all. Overpriced with sub-par quality foods as well as small portions. We had the macaroni and it was watery and almost flavorless. The other dish was a cheese enchilada and nachos that were of microwave quality.
