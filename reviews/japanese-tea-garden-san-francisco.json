The landscaping is stunning.  There are bridges, large koi ponds with a ton of massive koi, large pagodas, stone lanterns, Japanese plants including bonsai and cherry blossom trees.\n\nBring your camera!\n\nIt would actually be quite a tranquil and peaceful place had there not been a several groups of small screaming and crying children.", "author": "Danielle W."}

I really like the weird vertical bridge they have; some of the pagodas looked like they needed a new paint job, but I digress.\n\nIn addition to the scenery, inside is a little Japanese store and a tea place overlooking one of the ponds.  We sat down there, and got jasmine and hojicha teas.  They were good and it was nice they were served in traditional cups.  They had a small menu of food too which is cool.\n\nWould definitely recommend if you're visiting and you/your wife likes tea!", "author": "Justin L."}

I believe there are also free tours if you arrive by 9:30AM. \n\nI would not recommend purchasing any of the over priced trinkets in the shop, since they are things you can easily purchase at a lower price in SF Japantown or Chinatown.

It is the oldest public Japanese garden in the U.S.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the\u00a01894 World's Fair,\u00a0Makoto Hagiwara, a Japanese immigrant & gardener, personally oversaw the modification of the temporary Japanese Village fair exhibit to the permanent Japanese Tea Garden and was official caretaker of the garden from 1895 to 1925.\u00a0\n\nHe imported from Japan many plants, birds, and the now famous koi fish, and he more than tripled the size of the garden. After San Francisco's 1915\u00a0Panama-Pacific International Expositionclosed, he obtained the large ornamental wooden gate from that fair's Japanese Pavilion.\u00a0Following Makoto Hagiwara's death, his daughter, Takano Hagiwara & her children became the proprietors & maintainers of the garden.\u00a0\n\nWith the onset of World War II in America & rising anti Japanese sentiment, Takano Hagiwara was evicted from the family's home & sentenced to a U.S. concentration camp along w/ over 100,000 other Japanese Ameticans even though they were not convicted of any crime. The Hagiwara family was not allowed back into their home nor reimbursed after the war ended.\u00a0\n\nIn the period of their absence, the garden was renamed \"The Oriental Tea Garden,\" and any structure expressing Japanese sentiment was demolished, including the Hagiwara home & the original Shinto Shrine.\u00a0\n\nA plaque contrived by artist,\u00a0Ruth Asawa, famed artist known for her elegant, organic, woven metal sculptures,\u00a0was gifted to the garden in honor of Makoto Hagiwara & his family for their dedication to the garden's beginnings & expansion.\"\n\nCrowded as the Hagiwara Japanese Garden gets, there are still\u00a0nooks & crannies where the crowd thins out to provide a serene\u00a0setting. Spring is a great time since flowers abound, but any time of the year is fine.\u00a0\n\nGreat place to chill out when the city gets too overwhelming.

We had to stop and get some dessert/tea because can you really say you were here if you didn't? Personally, I don't think so. The ramen/other real food items were a little too much for us because we were going to have some sushi in the next hour. However, I do not regret ordering the matcha cheesecake/mochi. \n\nThe matcha cheesecake was creamy and had the right amount of matcha. It was definitely not too sweet and the matcha was not overpowering at all. I really could not stop myself from eating it. Even my bf, who really doesn't eat sweets that often enjoyed it. But he let me take the last bite. I really wish there was a larger size I can buy to go. \n\nThe mochi each had their unique flavors. Personally, I think I have to go with lychee as my favorite. They were super soft and not extra chewy. It was different from the typical mochi you get at froyo places or wrapped around ice cream. \n\nThe tea was nice and hot. I personally could take a stronger concentration of tea but its just a personal preference. It was a decent glass but I think the most \"expensive\" item considering it was just water and tea. \n\nOverall, I would come back for the dessert. Maybe I'll just buy the tea leaves and make it at home. It is way cheaper and I can make it to my liking.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

The oldest public Japanese garden in the United States, it was opened in 1894 as part of the California Expo. Japanese landscape architect Makoto Hagiwara and the city of San Francisco reached a gentleman's agreement, allowing Mr. Hagiwara to create and maintain a permanent Japanese style garden as a gift for posterity. He became caretaker of the lands, pouring all of his personal wealth, passion, and creativity into a garden of utmost perfection.\n\nThe Japanese Tea Garden is a complex of many paths, with classic elements such as an arched drum bridge, pagodas, stone lanterns, stepping stone paths, native Japanese plants, serene koi ponds and a zen garden.  Cherry blossom trees (Sakura) bloom throughout the garden in March and April. The elements of water and rocks combine to create a calming landscape designed to slow people down. To appreciate. To breathe. \n\nThe traditional Tea House is where you can experience Matcha, a high quality powdered green tea that is the only form of tea served in tea ceremonies. It is customarily served with popular confections or wagashi. Tea's of other sorts, such as Jasmine, Hojicha, Genmaicha, Sencha or Iced Green Tea can be purchased here as well, prices range in the $4-$5 range, with the exception of the Matcha which cost $8.50. Tea House sandwiches, Udon, Mochi, Tea House cookies are available too. If you are a traditionalist or just like things legit I'd suggest you experience the Matcha. \n\nThe Hagiwara family lived in the garden for many decades, until sadly, in 1942 Mr. Hagiwara and his family were uprooted and sent to an internment camp due to ignorance common at the time. They never returned. \n\nToday, the Japanese Tea Garden has endured for well over a century. The Hagiwara legacy continue to live in the manicured bonsai trees & delicate koi ponds here. Tranquility now. Open 365 days of the year.\n\n\"A hundred hearts would be too few to carry all my love for you...\" maybe even a thousand.", "author": "Eric R."}

This man-made, but yet so ethereal creation is something that very may well make you mistake the fact that you are in San Francisco.  For the hour or two that I spent soaking up the peaceful energy of the garden, I certainly forgot where I was.  Then again, it's nice to get lost in nature's beauty and wonderment.  \n\nSure, the entire Japanese Tea Garden was thought up and put in place by someone (which of course, is not \"natural\"), but it is nature, and it's art.  The garden is truly a masterpiece, where every blade of grass and ripple in the pond is exactly where it should be.  The pagodas, the bridges, pathways and flowers the lined them were nothing short of magnificent.  I honestly cannot say that I have encountered a more serene environment; walking through the garden instantaneously eased my anxiety, and I genuinely felt refreshed when leaving tbe garden.\n\nPerhals I am not alone whe  I say that the Japanese Tea Garden, besides awing you, also has a wonderful calming effect - I would bet that is supported by empirical evidence too.  As much as this is a tourist attraction, it is one that won't really feel like one, that is once you get past the part where you have to pay a $15 admission fee.  You won't feel like a tourist again until you hit the gift shop, which even then has the feel of a small Japanese shop you'd find on the streets of Kyoto.\n\nThe gift shop does have some neat items, but having gone to Japantown a few days later, I found very similar (if not the same) items for slightly cheaper.

City of San Francisco residents get discounts (ID with San Francisco address required). Students do not. Credit cards accepted. I think it's a good value any way you cut it.\n\nThe garden originally opened in 1894. Today, it encompasses about 5 acres; tiny compared to the rest of Golden Gate Park, but I can't think of a place in the park that's more peaceful and serene. It's like an oasis within an oasis.\n\nThere are several things to see and visit including a tea house (for tea and food like inari and futomaki -- pocket tofu and fat sushi rolls), gift shop (selling traditional Japanese items like tea and sake sets), pagodas/temples, bridges (including a steeply arched drum/moon bridge), pond (with koi), fountain, lanterns, sculptures, Buddha, and rock (or zen) garden. It's all packed neatly into a relatively small, clean, nicely groomed, and well manicured space.\n\nA visit to the tea garden could take anywhere from 15 minutes for a quick tour to an hour if you visit the tea house and gift shop.\n\nI love the entire look, feel, layout, design, and overall age-old aesthetic of the garden. A lot of paths and bridges wind and weave their way through the site. Seemingly at every turn, there is something neat or creative to discover. The views are magnificent, particularly around the water, and the attention to detail, especially as it applies to the garden's landscaping (trees, bushes, flowers, stones), is palpable.\n\nInside Golden Gate Park, the Japanese Tea Garden is located next door to the popular de Young fine arts museum and across the Music Concourse from the California Academy of Sciences. The road the garden and museum are located on, Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive, is named after Makoto Hagiwara, the creator and original caretaker of the garden.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Too bad I'm from SoCal. There was a cool bridge inside that went straight up and made a very high loop back down. There were koi fish in the pond and other Japanese buildings and structures to see. The gift shop was filled with pretty cool trinkets like chop sticks and tea sets. My husband and sister in law both bought their fortune there for $2 or $4 which proved to be fairly accurate. On the fortune, it says if you don't like it or don't want it to come true, you can leave it hanging up in a tree (I think) nearby. \n\nThe caf\u00e9 area was pretty cool too. I got the popcorn tea which was fragrant and tasty. The whole caf\u00e9 was positioned right next to the water so it was a good view all around. Overall, it's a whole different world inside.

This winter holiday, I finally got my wish. \n\nWe were late leaving home and didn't get to the tea garden till well after 10 am, so we missed the free admission - had to pay $8 per adult and $2 for our older kid. On the other hand, we got lucky and found free street parking just a couple hundred feet from the entrance, so it was a wash. \n\nThe garden is small but quaint, with bridges, pagodas, lots of flowing water and beautifully landscaped trees. Some of the structures looked a little run down and in need of a paint job. There were so many people milling around it was anything but tranquil, but we didn't mind, as our kids were happy to run around adding to the chaos after being cooped up in their car seats for over an hour. \n\nThe tea house was nice. We found a table easily and ordering was quick. We opted for food and beverages that were as authentic as possible -Japanese sencha and hojicha hot teas for my wife and I, hot chocolate for the girls, assorted sweet rice cakes (kuzumochi), red bean paste pancake (dorayaki), and tea house cookies for everyone. The kuzumochi was hands down my favorite - especially the mango and lychee flavored ones. \n\nCouple of other tips: \n--- You can leave the garden and return if you speak to the ticket booth person and keep your receipt. Came in handy as I had to run back to the van a couple of times. \n--- There are relatively clean bathrooms on site so be sure to use them before you leave. \n\nThe Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate park was lovely and I'm glad we went.

It's free admission on some weekdays before 10am, check their website. It's a great experience even if you have to pay and definitely worth it if it's your first time. The garden has more colors obviously in the fall or summer. This last time I went was in February but nevertheless it is beautiful. The trees are well taken care of, and beautifully shaped. It is tranquil and a nice place to just relax. The reason for an average rating is for some reason there are nowhere near as many koi fish as before...where have they all gone?? There used to be so many that there were hardly room to swim and they were all chubby and so pretty. Maybe because it is in the middle of winter...but I was disappointed. \n\nThere is a little gift shop that sells knick knacks and Japanese culture related things such as tea sets and household ceramics. My bf got me an adorable sheep keychain! But really most things are overpriced and aimed to entice tourists into spending. \n\nNext to the gift shop is an adorable tea shop overlooking the pond.  Take a menu and order at the register. They give you a number and you sit anywhere you want. Try to sit next to the pond, it's so peaceful and a lovely place to sip tea. My boyfriend ordered the matcha tea, a red bean pancake and I ordered my favorite tea sandwiches. The matcha was actually pretty fragrant, though I thought was very expensive for the quality. It came with a really good green tea mochi. The mochi was not to sweet which was nice. The red bean pancake was ok, I think it needed more red bean flavor. It was a little too artificial to me. My sandwiches were adorably yummy. It seems simple...but the bread is so soft, and the fillings are just so decadent.

We parked our car by MLK, about half a mile from the Japanese Tea Garden. We toured the garden for about one hour. As soon as we returned, we found out that we had our front passenger window car smashed and had most of our valuables and belongings stolen. There was no security to summon and when we called the park workers for help, they told us to called 311 instead. No help was even offered. I was so disappointed to see their reaction. Like they know this crimes occurred on daily basis and decided not to care. Even after our line was picked up by 311, they only took our report by the phone. We were told by a sympathetic passerby that our car wasn't the only one who got break-in that day. Luckily she said there was a police nearby so we ran towards the other location and called the police for help. \n\nAfter everything that had happened and what I heard from the passerby, we would think with daily robberies in an area frequented by families and tourist, the city would provide and increase surveillance.

I was lucky there wasn't a line but while I was next, my sis and aunt snagged a table.  The set up is you order at the counter and then you sit down and wait for your goodies to come.  It doesn't take long at all; a lot of the goodies are already prepped.\n\nHere's what we shared between the 3 of us:\n\nSENCHA TEA - $4.99\nJapanese green tea prepared by steaming its leaves and rolling them into their signature needle-life shape.  It is characterized by a distinctly bright, sweet, aroma and flavor.  This tea is steeped and served in a small teapot. \nThis is enough for one cup for each of us.

It's your pretty standard miso soup.  \n\nGREEN TEA CHEESECAKE - $6.50\nSmooth and delicious Japanese style cheesecake.\nThis fluffy and fish cheesecake was pretty good.  You definitely taste the green tea flavor and was a good portion to share.\n\nKUZUMOCHI (6pcs) - $4.95\nHouse-made sweet rice cakes.\nThe 3 flavors that came in our set was:\nMANGO, STRAWBERRY, and GREEN TEA.  I thought they all tasted wonderful, tender, soft and full of flavor!  This was fun to eat!\n\nPETIT FOUR - $6.50\nThese little cakes tasted mostly like almond probably because of the fondant.  This was the least favorite and we only got it cuz it looked pretty.  One of them had a bean filling.  \n\nUDON SOUP - $8.99\nThis seems to be one of the specials of the day.

I've been to several in various cities in California...and I have to say that after only two visits, this one has grown to be my favorite so far. Both visits were during the autumn..but unlike my first visit which was in the afternoon, this time we stopped by shortly after it opened in the morning.\n\nThis tea garden is gorgeous. The landscapes are beautiful, simple and complex woven with water, wood, rock and plant features, including stepping paths, bridges, hills, streams and waterfalls. There are shady glens that rarely see full sun, and thin pockets of trees through which the morning light was next to magical.  Each turn of the winding garden path takes you to a new tiny world.\n\nThe autumn colors (ginkgoes' leaves were golden yellow and maples were starting to turn gold and red) were lovely, and glistened in the morning sun. I can only imagine how beautiful this place is in the other seasons as well. \n\nAll ponds were stocked full with large graceful koi fish, and there were plenty of tucked away benches to sit on to enjoy the peaceful space for a few more moments.\n\nSome of the architectural features include a half-circle wooden bridge, several statutes, an outdoor tea house, and a gift shop--both inspired by Japanese architecture and design, \n\nThe tea house sells tea and some snack foods. My favorite tea was the gen mai cha (toasted rice and green tea). The mochi variety snack plate was okay, with the peanut flavored mochi falling flat. Strawberry and lychee flavored mochi was pretty cool.\n\nIt does cost to get in, but I didn't mind paying. If the money is what keeps this place well manicured and clean--it is worth it.  If you are looking for a respite from a busy life, a lovely place to take family, or just something to break up your usual routine, stop by and rest awhile.", "author": "Tashara H."}

I took part in walking tour and after a delightful brunch we walked a mile to get to Golden Gate Park.  When we were done exploring it I split from the group and walked all the way back to the California Academy of Sciences because it looked really interesting.  After wandering through that I was pretty much ready to call it a day.  When I looked on a map to see where the heck I was I noticed that a Japanese Tea Garden was extremely close.  Thinking I would regret it if I didn't go see it I braced myself for more walking.  At this point it was getting later in the day but with only eight bucks charged for admission I didn't mind that my experience would be short.\n\nConsidering how late in the afternoon it was I was surprised that there was a sizeable line to get inside.  This is obviously a popular attraction.  Once I started walking through the gardens I instantly was glad that I had decided to visit.  It was just one beautiful sight after another and brought back happy memories of my trip to Japan.  I thought the arched drum bridge was a fun climb but be careful because it's quite steep!

The garden wasn't too crowded, so it was pretty relaxing to walk around aside from the families taking photos everywhere. $7 for non-residents of SF and on MWF admission is free before 10 am. In a busy city like San Francisco, it's refreshing to see a place like this.\n\nThe Garden:\n\nPretty nice to walk around, and a great opportunity to take pictures with the landscape There are ponds and rock gardens among nicely kept lawns. I've always admired the Japanese culture for their attention to detail with gardens and how it's aesthetically pleasing to the eye, even when the colors are just natural hues of green, brown, and gray. The hedges are nicely trimmed, with some having perfect roundness or looking like cubes. It was pretty warm that day, so I think all the koi fish were trying to avoid the middle of the pond - they kept bundling up in the shaded areas.\n\nThe structures they have are nice, especially that arch bridge. For a garden that's supposed to be relaxing, that bridge seems kinda dangerous to cross... but it's easy to do. Be careful since there are people who crowd at the top for photos or take photos while climbing, then there are the unsupervised children who are climbing all over the bridge. Fear not, you do not have the take the arch bridge as there are stone paths to get around. I do like how some of the paths were just flat rocks to cross a pond.\n\nBe sure to check out the red pagoda above the garden, as it's a great photo opportunity and there is a gate as well. They do a good job of putting benches everywhere in the garden, so if you're here on a weekday when it's less busy, it'd be the perfect place to read a book or sketch.\n\nThe Tea House:\n\nThe cafe/tea house overlooks the garden - I'd recommend sitting on the edges to enjoy the view. It can get pretty crowded with seating, but once you get your number after ordering, it shouldn't be hard to find a table aWe decided to have an afternoon snack of iced green tea, tea sandwiches, and mochi. Iced green teas ($3.75 each for a mug) was perfectly chilled - not sure why others complained it was too sweet... since mine tasted like actual matcha, and not the crap you get at Starbucks.\n\nThe sandwiches were tiny for $8.95 (you could finish in 2 bites) but tasty and a little refreshing on a warm day. No crusts on these sandwiches and the white bread they use is super fluff. \n\nThere's 2 of each flavor:\n- Cheese and Apple: This was my favorite, I'll have to start putting apples with my cheese sandwiches.\n- Cucumber + Turkey: Good combination.\n- Ham and Mayonnaise: Tastes like what you'd expect.\n- Tuna: Eh, tuna is tuna but it wasn't too fishy.\n\nI'd highly recommend getting the mochi here, as it's sweet, chilled, and chewy! We got the 6 pieces for $5 - they came in green tea, mango, and strawberry. Mango was my favorite flavor, as you could taste the mango.\n\nFood is pretty expensive here, but sometimes it's worth the experience. Also I really enjoyed having some iced matcha green tea after walking around all day.\n\nOverall, it's a nice stop while exploring Golden Gate Park, more like a 3.5. We ended up spending 1.5 hours here between walking through the garden and chilling at the tea house - the garden is pretty small compared to other Japanese gardens I've visited around the country, but still well kept.

I can only compare it to the gardens I've been to in the past. \n\nCompared to the Japanese garden in Balboa Park (San Diego) this one has more structures to see and more expansive flora. The one in SD is a few bucks cheaper,  maybe a little larger,had a deeper basin area, more running water and bamboo forest but this one had a more scenic casual vibe. The SD one had mini Japanese house/museum workshop area with kimonos on display and a variety of other characteristically Japanese structures but all in all, it seemed a little bit contrived. The SF one was less like that and more a place to relax and stroll around. Both gardens have very circular paths, i.e, there aren't paths that lead to exciting or new things. You can finish checking the garden out in ~10 min if you don't stop for pictures. It's also nice that the footbridge is climbable and there are rocks you can walk on. \n\nHOWEVER, I wouldn't spend my money just to take a 'stroll' at these parks again. Don't get me wrong--both were beautiful places to visit and I'd recommend people to check it out if they've never seen a Japanese garden before, but there wasn't anything particularly special about them. \n\nThe only garden place that is worth spending money to visit in my opinion is the Huntington Gardens in Pasadena.

There was quite a big line outside to get in, but it was fast moving. As I went to park the car after dropping the other 2 in my party, I asked them to get 3 tickets for us but that wasn't allowed. Everyone needs to get their own tickets by getting in the line. So my friends had to wait for me at the tea house where they ordered tea and some small sweet snacks. Tea was okay but it was a nice experience pouring it out and sitting with the view of the gardens. The gardens themselves are little small, but have some highlights and good photo points. The bridge was pretty popular and so were the small japanese style pagodas which were giving a nice feel to the gardens. Cherry blossoms were blooming too. Its a very small walk and $9 is about the max that I would like to pay to get in here. Outside the gardens is nice area to just hang out or bike around on a nice sunny day in the city.", "author": "Roma M."}

I just wasn't amazed by this one. I feel like when I usually go into Japanese gardens, the moment I step in I always feel some type of way. I was let down here. Before going, my cousin who resides in SF told us that we'd be in and out real quick and she actually didn't even come in with us because she didn't want to waste the money as it wasn't worth it since she's been. To be honest, we really could've been in and out quickly because there wasn't anything special to see. However we did take longer than expected just because of the one tall bridge that everyone wanted to take pictures with had a line, except no one else waited in a line except for my group and two other people. Others kept going up and down the bridge without any courtesy to those on the bridge trying to take individual pictures. The people who were in line in front of me and the ones on the bridge were so annoyed as people kept coming up into the pictures. I know it's a tourist place and everyone's roaming around, but there are designated spots where a staff member needs to be around to control and direct traffic. It literally took forever to get one perfect picture and even then it was rushed and not so perfect because we felt bad taking too long knowing there was an actual line as we waited in. Not to even mention the wailing little girl that was on there and her parents who supposedly couldn't get her down. I wouldn't even know how to describe the situation but let's just say it took up a long 10 mins of our time waiting until the dad finally took action and carried the girl down as he should've done from the start. Then him and his wife started arguing about how the little girl kept bawling and it was totally a scene. I know this isn't the Japanese garden's fault but if there was a staff member there, that person could've helped move the situation along! As mentioned, nothing impressing at this specific Japanese garden. I've been to a handful that has blown me away so this was disappointing. I would've rather gone to other destinations instead.", "author": "Jessica P."}

We had a great time walking in the garden for a couple of hours, so the tea house despite being a great experience in regards to the tea and finger foods and the environment....was off putting due to the couple of rude young women working there.

The Japanese Tea Garden is located in Golden state Park, and is a nice, long walk from where we parked. \n\nAdmission is $8.00 per adult, children is $4 and on Mondays and Wednesdays it's free before 10:00 am. Unfortunately, we got there late and ended up paying for admission. But it was worth it. \n\nThe grounds are beautiful, with the traditional manicured landscaping, koi ponds, bridges, Japanese structures and cherry blossom trees. There's a cute tea shop in the middle, which served traditional Japanese food like udon soup, mochi, edamame, Japanese snacks, etc. We ordered the tea sandwiches, which were so good! About  $9 for a plate of about 8 pieces. We also had the sencha tea, and other misc goodies.\n\nI took off one star simply for the amount of people that were in the garden at that time. It was hard to enjoy the place without some tourist running around with their cameras out getting in the way of the views. But honestly, I don't blame them...it is pretty in there.

There's a lot of free street parking around but we decided to just park in the structure so we didn't have to park far.\n\nIt's known as the oldest public Japanese garden in the US. Once you step in you feel a sense of zen and calmness while walking through the whole garden. Although there's a lot of tourists there, I had an amazing experience taking it all in enjoying the views and sculptures. \n\nMy favorite part was the mini bridge that you could go up carefully and view the garden from above and I also enjoyed the peaceful waterfall setting that surrounded the gift shop. We were on a time limit so we couldn't stop in for a cup of tea. Perfect place to take picture of the landscape views. Of course, we took every picture opportunity throughout the whole place.

We were really hungry and decided to eat there. Everything is prepackaged. I tried to order a vegetarian tea sandwich, but they couldn't accommodate it since it was already prepackaged. The tea sandwich plate has 4 different kind of tea sandwiches- one of the 4 is vegetarian. Unfortunately they do not have anything to order that's vegetarian except the assorted Japanese crackers. I ordered that & then my friends let me have one of their vegetarian tea sandwich. The vegetarian one is SO yummy though! It's apples and cheddar cheese- so delicious. They definitely should offer vegetarian options for people to eat. I was very disappointed I only could order Japanese crackers.", "author": "Kim P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-02", "description": "The one star review is for the gift shop in the garden (read below), the garden itself is five stars. \n\nBEWARE of the gift shop next to the cafe in the garden. I started to enter the shop after a lovely snack at the cafe- I was barely half way through the door when I heard something fall from the glass shelf which was literally within an inch to the right side of the entry door- and it turned out that a little clay painted Japanese doll (about 2 inches tall) had fallen from the glass shelf , and had fallen backwards between the shelf and the glass walls of the shop. It was stuck between the shelf and the glass wall and hadn't fallen all the way down to the floor. \n\nThe store lady immediately came to check and and put her hand behind the shelf and pulled it out and took it away. I felt guilty because it fell while I was entering the store, so it was possible that something I did might have caused it to fall (although as I said, I was barely one foot in the door- but whatever it was, at the time of the fall, I was the one closest to the fallen doll) and I went after the store lady to ask her if the piece was OK. She said she will have to ask the store manager, and went into a room behind the check-out counter. \n\nI didn't want to leave the store while she was gone as I didn't want it to appear that I was running away after damaging their stuff, so I waited for a few minutes and then the store manager came out and said that he wouldn't be able to see the piece and that I had to buy it. I didn't argue, because I had no proof that I was not responsible for the doll falling off the shelf, plus I didn't want to create any drama, as I fully understand that if you break something in the store then you have to pay for it- so I paid the $15 for the doll (thank goodness it wasn't too expensive!). \n\nWhile the lady was packing it up in a bag, I told her to please not put these show pieces right next to the entry way in the future as it could potentially cause such issues again. She just ignored me and said 'Next'. I quietly walked out of the store thinking to myself that I would go home and write a yelp review about the store. But I didn't as I got lazy to write the review and I said to myself \"Forget it\".  \n\nHowever, a few weeks later (i.e. today), I opened the brown paper bag in which the doll was wrapped in, and I was shocked to see the state the doll was in- there are paint smudges on the doll, dirt marks, and several areas on the doll that has some white spots (like the paint has chipped off). I was surprised that the fall from the shelf and getting stuck between the shelf and the wall could cause all these damages to the doll. So, I kept the doll on my kitchen island and made it fall all the way to the ground several times, and believe me, nothing happened to the doll, it didn't break, no chipped paint, no nothing!! \n\nI am now furious and am writing this yelp review. I feel cheated. I didn't check the state of the doll before buying it when I was there because a lot of customers were just standing and looking at the manager telling me that I had to buy the doll since I dropped it, and I felt at the time that if I asked to see the damage then it would imply that I didn't want to pay up for a mistake I made, and I was feeling embarrassed anyway. But now, I realize that this was a bad piece to begin with and the store manager jipped me by saying that he couldn't sell the piece because of me. \n\nI am really angry. It's not about the $15. It's about feeling cheated. And I blame myself for not being more assertive at that time. Lesson learned. I just wanted to warn you all as well.", "author": "Tripthi K."}

Maybe that's because I recently visited the Japanese garden in Portland and it was much larger and there was much more to see. \n\nThis Japanese tea Garden in Golden gate Park is really tiny. Though the admission price is fairly cheap, i'm not sure the size of this garden even warrants that price. \n\nWhen you enter the gate you pay at the little kiosk. There are different prices for San Francisco residents versus non-residents. Note there is no reduced student fee. \n\nOnce you're in you find there are really only two directions to go. If you walk quickly and don't stop to take any pictures you can probably be done in 15 minutes. \n\nThere isn't much to see, the highlights are two small Japanese towers. A pond with fish in it. And a very tall vertical bridge. \n\nWe probably spent the most time at the teahouse that's inside the garden. They serve a few varieties of tea as well as mini sandwiches, cake, and ice cream. \n\nThis is a place I will not be returning to.

You will also see a rich display of Japanese culture by prominent structures such as the pagoda, a drum bridge and a tea house.\n\nWhat you probably won't be able to see, however, is its rich history of the past - a past that many would rather forget.\n\nBuilt in 1894 by Japanese immigrant Makoto Hagiwara using his own personal fortunes, it is the oldest public and formal Japanese Garden in the United States.\n\nHagiwara was responsible for the funding, building and upkeep of the garden until his death in 1925.  His children and grandchildren continued to maintain his legacy until 1942, when the Hagiwara family, along with about 120,000 Japanese Americans, were forced to leave their homes and were imprisoned in internment camps.\n\nDuring WWII the word \"Japanese\" was removed and the garden was renamed Oriental Tea Garden.  The garden went into disrepair.  Many plants and floral arrangements withered due to a lack of care.  Many sculptures, structures, and valuable artifacts were destroyed or stolen.\n\nAfter the war has ended, the Hagiwara family was not allowed to return to their home in the tea garden.  Although the name Japanese Tea Garden was reinstated in 1952, it no longer resembled the original garden created by Mr. Hagiwara, which has been, for the most part, erased.\n\nThe Lantern of Peace that you'll see when you visit the garden was placed there in 1953 in an attempt by the city's officials to ease the tension with Japanese Americans.  In 1965, a large collection of dwarf trees, stones and lanterns originally belonging to the Hagiwara family were returned to the garden, which now represent the last remnants of the past.\n\nMost of the structures that you'll see, such as the Mount Fuji landscapes, the pagoda, the Zen Garden, among others were actually additions made from 1960's through 1980's.  The original gates, which are rich in history and culture, were restored in the 1980's.\n\nIt was not until 1974 before the Hagiwara family was finally honored, with the city of San Francisco placing a bronze plaque at the Main Gate.\n\nTo access the Japanese Tea Garden by car, from eastbound John F. Kennedy Drive turn right into Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive.", "author": "Rob L."}

I heard it's $7, but also know the money goes towards the overall upkeep of Golden Gate Park, so that's not a bad worthy cause to support.\n\nOn certain days, between 9am-10am it's FREE however, and I'd recommend waking up early to check it out in conjunction with other activities. It's definitively, worth it to check out for FREE, whether a local or a tourist, or especially if you have a large group where # x $7 = $$$ and you're trying to find fun things to do that won't break the bank or empty your wallet/purse.\n\nIt's sort of a \"side dish\" or \"appetizer\" to the \"main course\" or \"entree\" of other things to do in the world of activities in my opinion.", "author": "Rick S."}

It's been my city home away from home for most of my life, yet up until a couple weeks ago I'd never been to one of Golden Gate Parks greatest attractions. \n\nThe garden is beautifully crafted, from the intricate and authentic Japanese structures to the stone bridges to the clean walkways and carefully trimmed hedges and flowers. Walk around for a little while on a weekday morning and you'll easily feel like you've been transported across the Pacific. There are little plaques explaining the gardens history and importance, as well as the story of the architect behind it. \n\nOne minor criticism is the cost. It's a beautiful garden in a park for everyone, so why does it cost a pretty penny to get in and why is everything in the gift shop so damn expensive? They need to make money to keep the park going, I assume. And for that reason I forgive them.", "author": "Alex L."}

It's a popular and a very busy spot to sit and enjoy tea and snacks. The pagodas, the massive Buddha, and the drum bridge are also major attractions. Because of the layout it is possible to meander about and enjoy the gardens from different vantage points. Despite the hordes of tourist and locals somehow it is still a soothing garden to spend some time wandering in. \n\nThe garden was originally created as a \"Japanese Village\" exhibit for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition. From that one acre site it expanded to its current size of about 5 acres. It is the oldest public Japanese garden in the United States. \n\nThe garden is open seven days a week; it is very busy on the weekends. My only complaint is that local residents pay less to come into the garden. I really think the entry fee should be the same for everyone. \n\nI thought that the admission, reasonable as it is, might make this a 4 star review. But no, it is at least 5 stars.

Every corner, every step in this tea garden is a photo op! There's ponds, koi fishes, a Buddha, exotic flora, and some unique little buildings that embody the Japanese style. This is one of those places where I have to let the pictures do the talking because I'm not really an expert on flora. \n\nAlso, there's a moon bridge! Most people I saw tend to walk to the top and go back the same way. I totally just walked that thing across.\n\nYes, they do sell tea. Although I wasn't really there for the tea. I was just there to take pictures.\n\nThe Japanese Tea Garden isn't really that big. However, it's really beautiful and it's also the oldest public Japanese Garden in the United States (yay trivia!)

It was, so walked in, strolled the paths and relaxed in the mist-filled atmosphere surrounded by the beauty around us. After our stroll, we went to the tea house and ordered the sencha tea with the petit fours. The service was kind, the tea was amazing and the petit fours were a perfect treat.

Admission is $5 for residents, $7 for non-residents, and FREE on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 9am-10am. Open daily at 9am, but closes earlier during the winter months. They also do not close on holidays (according to their website).\n\nThe best way to describe this place is serene. It's lush and beautiful. We really enjoyed walking around, admiring the architecture, landscaping, and koi ponds. It's not extremely large, so even with a leisurely walk and photographs, it's less than an hour. There's a gift shop with very cute Japanese and San Francisco-themed trinkets in the garden (I got an adorable panda matryoshka doll) as well as the Jack Hirose Teahouse. \n\nThe teahouse is located in/near the center of the garden, offering hot teas and light snacks. We chose the Matcha (high quality powered green tea) served with Green Tea Mochi for $8.50, Genmaicha (Japanese green tea blended with brown rice) for $3.75, and Kuzumochi in mango and lychee (6 pieces for $4.95). The Matcha and Genmaicha were delicious and a nice treat for the unusually cold summer weather. The mochi was very soft and chewy. It's a great place to relax because it's open-air and you can enjoy the carefully manicured trees around you while sipping tea.\n\nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a couple hours of our morning with a good friend.

It's my little wooden geisha sandals (geta) as I walk very slowly to the Japanese Tea Garden, an oasis of serenity (kinda) that has not seen my face since my first grade field trip with Mrs. Kullman, who had bye-bye arms when she wrote on the blackboard. Far be it for me to spread trivialized Japanese stereotypes, so for review #2100, Jamie W. and I have returned to the tranquil garden of my people where I do not have to deal with da' man. No, not Jamie. I'm talkin' 'bout da' Man! 'Cause da' man can get me down. Know what I'm sayin'?\n\nLike many others, I tend to forget the garden is there since it's been dwarfed by the twin juggernauts of the DeYoung Museum and the California Academy of Sciences. But here it is, all five acres of it, and it's still the bucolic retreat originally developed for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition. It was converted from a temporary exhibit into a permanent park after the fair's conclusion thanks to the efforts of Makoto Hagiwara, a Japanese immigrant and gardener, who approached Golden Gate Park superintendent John McLaren with the idea. Hagiwara oversaw the garden's construction and became official caretaker, a role be played for three decades until 1925.\n\nHagiwara specifically requested that one thousand flowering cherry trees be imported from Japan. His family lived in and maintained the Japanese Tea Garden until 1942 when Executive Order 9066 forced them to leave San Francisco and relocate to an internment camp. The garden was then renamed the \"Oriental Tea Garden\" at which point it fell into a state of disarray. The name \"Japanese Tea Garden\" was officially reinstated in 1952. Over the years, it has gradually come back to life with the semi-circular Drum Bridge still its decorative, foot-unfriendly centerpiece. Several circuitous paths lead to the other key attractions like the hilltop pagoda, a monumental Buddha, a miniature waterfall, and a Japanese-style tea house overlooking a koi-filled pond.\n\nIn 2009, a controversy erupted over the caf\u00e9 ownership when a Japantown caf\u00e9 owner won the contract to run the operation with a $500,000 grant for improvements in order to move it away from \"a tourist spot that serves Chinese fortune cookies and sells generic souvenirs\". The departing Chinese-American vendor claimed racial discrimination. The brouhaha has since been settled, and now is a good time to visit with a cascade of wisteria covering the caf\u00e9. The cherry blossoms show up briefly in a mercilessly short season with a full bloom reached about one week after the opening of the first blossoms. Regardless, the Japanese Tea Garden is well worth a stop if just for the tranquil beauty it achieves amid the throngs of tourists that visit. Clip-clop. Clip-clop. Clip-clop...", "author": "Ed U."}

There is a zen garden that I liked and a koi pond with lots of fish swimming around. The walk through the garden is much shorter than i expected, taking us a under an hour total to see the entire garden while walking at a slow pace and posing for pictures. I also liked the Japanese pagodas that were in the garden since they were placed amidst nice flowers and a waterfall. The best picture had to be at the top of the Japanese footbridge that they had. The bridge is high arching, so you will have to help the youngins getting off of the bridge. The other cool thing to do while at the tea garden is to actually have tea. We got a cookie platter as well with the tea and everyone seemed to enjoy the experience of hot tea on a drizzly day.

And of course, perhaps also the crowds(or at least some of them) I noticed, at the time I went?\n\nThat said, it really is a great place to walk through. All the other reviews are right that you can literally walk the whole grounds of this place in less than an hour, and my recollection is that I saw just about all of it within 30-45 minutes. Loved the drum bridge, and the other buildings on the Tea Garden grounds were also great to see. I guess I was hoping there'd be a little more to see and/or on site activities/events to do, to justify the $7 admission fee. Didn't get a drink in the tea room part of the place, or eat in their cafe, so no clue how the tea drinks or cafe food is like.\n\nIf only not for the pricey $7 admission fee for non-SF residents, I would've gladly given this place 4 stars. Nice to see someone mentioned Hakone Estate and Gardens in Saratoga(southwest of San Jose), which I'd never heard of till now. Guess if I ever travel west to this part of California again, I should check that out to see how Hakone compares to here?", "author": "Allan M."}

This place was on top of the list of things to check out. I arrived  If it's been there since 1894, it's got to be impressive. After taking the various buses and subways to get here, I entered the park and found the nearest map. I followed it's instructions to get to the Japanese Tea Garden.  $7 got you inside their big front gate. I began to wander around the paths snapping photographs of various things. It was very scenic and relaxing. The trees reminded me of giant bonsai trees.  The gardens, statues and sculptures reminded me of Asian things I had seen in other places. There was a Budda statue, there were a few of those tiered house-thingies.  There were also Koi ponds with sculptures in and around them.. After I wandered around for a bit, I decided that  I really should get some Tea while in the Japanese Tea Gardens. So I wandered around and found the line to wait in. Wow. This is a popular on a Saturday.  I chatted with the people in line ahead of me. They were also tourists, visiting San Francisco for a concert tonight. I didn't know who it was, even after they told me who it was.\n   After waiting in line a bit, I ordered a 6 piece kuzumochi & an iced green tea for about $7.  I then went to find a place to sit. That was a challenge in itself. Lots and lots of people, not many places to sit. Eventually I got lucky, and found a place. I sat down with my number and waited for my things to arrive. Before too long my items arrived, and I ate.  The iced tea was tasty and cold, the kuzumochi was mixed. I didn't particularly care for the grey ones. But the yellow & pink ones were pretty good.\n   As I began to finish up the food, I felt a presence behind me. I turned to discover a family awkwardly hovering close to me and my bench seat. They were eyeing my spot hungrily. I quickly finished up, picked up my trash, packed up my stuff and cleared out.\n\n     Well, now I've seen the Japanese Tea Garden everybody was raving about. Meh? It was okay? While it was beautifully landscaped, soothing and calming and all that, I don't really feel the overwhelming desire to go back.  Maybe if your trying to impress a girl on a date? There's plenty of other stuff in that Golden Gate Park.\n   \nFYI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_garden_at_Golden_Gate_Park", "author": "Scott B."}

While walking through here was very enjoyable for the price it does seem to fall short on delivering an unforgettable experience. But then again what is one to expect? A  dragon creeping behind every other tree? I think not. \n\nSince I was on vacation the extra $7 sort of got absorbed by larger costs but if I were being very budget conscious I would skip the Tea Garden since GGP offers a lot of other great places to check out. \n\nI came here when it wasn't the cherry blossom season so my experience was not the best it could have been, but it was still very peaceful to walk around here and get to sample a mini Japanese experience that does not involve sushi. \n\nThe \"tea\" portion of the garden was a very pleasant break from a full days walking around the park. I think that too was overpriced (I originally hail from Sri Lanka so paying a high price for tea does not sit well with me regardless of how amazing it is). \nBut I have to admit the quality of the tea here was good but it came second to the amazing Kuzumochi which I can never have enough of. \n\nIf you have a lot of time to kill in the park, and you have never been to Japan or just love everything Japanese this would be a great accessory to your day. It gets a solid 3.5 stars from me.", "author": "Dishan W."}

There's free admission Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings between 9-10 AM. I couldn't make it at that time and paid the $8 regular admission. In my opinion, the garden is not really worth $8 because it only takes about half an hour to walk through the whole thing. However, I do think the garden is very nice and would love to go back during the free hours.\n\nThere are a bunch of benches around the area to sit down and admire the many ornate structures like the pagoda and the statue of Buddha within the garden. While I was there, I also encountered a guided tour group where the guide was explaining some of the historical stuff behind different parts of the garden. It sounded interesting! The main attraction is obviously the tea house, but I didn't go in there this time. But I did go into the gift shop and they had a lot of cute things and nice ceramic stuff.

If you need some serenity in your life, do yourself a favor and find a way to come here on a weekday, early in the day and soak it in. It's hard to let the peacefulness overcome you when it is crowded, but there are a few hidden spots where you can find the time, even with the crowds.\n\nAt $7 ($5 for SF residents), I find it to be a bargain. It is small and if you don't take your time you will be done in less than an hour.* The landscape is overwhelmingly manicured and it provides a nice set of levels throughout the garden. Some smaller versions of temples provide a break in height and color that only add to the overall ambience of being inside this place.\n\nYou are in the middle of a feng shui dream - water, plants and buddha to guide you through a short break from the monotony and over-connectedness of your life.** Follow the paths, sit on a bench and definitely visit the gift shop and the small restaurant. I am still kicking myself for not knowing there was food inside.\n_________________\n*Take your time. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the person always on the go, rushing through everything and forgetting to look at what is right in front of you and enjoy it.

You can tell that a great deal of care and attention goes into these grounds, and that makes it worth the admission price in my book. It's a wonderful place to take a break from the city, inhale some fresh air, and stroll in a calming haven for nature. If you're a photographer, you will love how photogenic this place is.

I was with 3 people and admission for all of us was only $20. It wasn't expensive and if you are a person that loves nature and the Asian style theme, you'll love it! Staff was very friendly and this is a great place to take pictures. Sure, you probably don't want to spend more than an 1-2 hours there, but it's worth the experience. You don't see something like this everyday and if you need something to help pass time. This is definitely a good place to go!", "author": "Gen D."}

No student discount and the lady at the door was not polite when I asked about it. I think $8 is too much for such a small place.

I had lived in San Francisco itself for about two of those, making several trips to Golden Gate Park, yet I had truly never \"seen\" this place until the day I toured the Japanese Tea Garden with my sweetheart.\n\nSome people don't like doing \"touristy\" things within the cities they reside in. That makes sense when you're talking about Fisherman's Wharf or other cheezy places you'll find your average \"Touron\", (as my Yelp buddy Cherylynn N. would call them) meandering about. However when speaking of beautiful landmarks such as this, it's one of the many reasons SF is my favorite city in the world. If you haven't been here, you are truly missing out on a fabulous \"only in SF\" experience.\n\nFrom the well manicured gardens to the traditional Japanese structures, everything is beautiful without feeling fake or cheezy. We had an awesome time exploring all the various plants, koi ponds, and statues. Everything is so perfectly landscaped you can see the love that is put into it's design and upkeep.\n\nThe gift store is admittedly touristy but they did have some pretty cool unique made in China trinkets that were tempting, but probably can be found for several times cheaper elsewhere. If you happen to come here with a loved one, be sure to stop off at the actual Tea House to share a tea together. It's a beautiful setting for which to do so.\n\nIf you live in the area, you owe it to yourself to check it out. I'm sure it's even more gorgeous in the spring months when the Cherry Blossoms among the other flora are in full bloom. I have to say a special thank you to my babygirl for showing me a wonderful time in this marvelous location.", "author": "John B."}

This is probably the best Japanese Garden in the United States, on par with Seattle's. It is amazing how well-cultivated and florid this garden is despite California's often hot and dry air. If only this garden were better appreciated by visitors.\n\nUnfortunately, most Americans do not understand the purpose of a Japanese garden or how to enjoy one- to quietly view, think, savor, reflect, pause, sit. In Heian times the colors and types of plants and rocks would evoke famous poetry and people would put it all together in recognition. Viewing gardens can be a spiritual if not religious experience. Our culture today is nowhere near as refined as that. Maybe it's just the times we live in, but on busier days, there is constant stream of people imposing themselves in front of each view, taking selfies. I thought to myself- \"why not just tear up the trees and take them home with you as adornments to your magnificent self?\" They seem obsessed with capturing the beauty of the gardens as accessories to their own faces in pictures. I picked up litter and candy wrappers left by visitors, and some young instagram-generation 20-somethings were playing awful autotuned R&B music in the tea pavilion as the rest of us tried to enjoy the otherwise serene surroundings with matcha and food pairings. Sorry if my review of the garden ended with a critique of our cultural idiosyncrasies- but perhaps this garden is the antidote. Perhaps more education at the front gate would help people know what they are looking at.", "author": "X S."}

I did not learn anything during my visit.\n\nAs everyone has already mentioned, visiting their onsite tea-house is a must.

We actually were supposed to come on one day, but couldn't, for the life of us, find parking. So we did something else and came back the next day. Since it was my first time visiting San Francisco, I read that this was a place that had to be visited. I'm glad I did. \n\nThe place was lovely. When we got there, it was quite gloomy. You have to pay $7 to get in, I believe, and $5 if you are a SF resident. There were a number of paths, a rock garden, and a bridge that you had to climb. By the time we had walked one of the paths, it started raining. So it made it kind of difficult for me to climb the bridge and walk across the rock path in the ponds. \n\nI spotted a little teahouse that had a number of people sitting at. I got the sencha tea, which came in a little pot, and my boyfriend got the hojicha. We also got miso soup and the green tea cheesecake, which I found awesome. By this time, it was pouring, but the perfect setting for enjoying my tea. The little pot with my tea had enough to fill three teacups, so it made it worth the $3.75 that we paid. The hojicha was $3.50, cheesecake $5.50, and miso soup $3.95. \n\nAfterwards, we decided to go to the little gift shop near the teahouse. There were two little old Japanese ladies who were just sweet as pie. The shop had various items, such as tea sets, chopsticks, post cards, and origami jewelry. We ended up only getting a couple post cards before we left. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience. I kind of wish it hadn't rained so hard since it made it difficult to see the entire garden. I also wasn't too fond of the admission price considering that most of the teahouse things were more on the expensive side. But I could understand why it had to be done that way. \n\nI can't wait until the next time I visit SF. This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.", "author": "Reneesha R."}

We got there around 1PM on a Saturday and as soon as we entered, were approached by a woman doing a free tour courtesy of the SF City Guides. We just learned that SF City Guides has leads 60 tours a week all around San Francisco, all of which are free! We really enjoyed our tour guide, Christine. She did a great job of getting us through the different gardens fairly quickly and made the information/background of interesting and relatable. I'm so glad that we were able to take part in this tour. We learned so much about the history and the intentions of the aritsts. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to the garden during the time of a tour. It makes the experience so much more worth it and you'll end up appreciating the gardens so much more.\n\nThe gardens themselves are beautiful.

The walk only takes about 10-15 minutes to venture through though, so an hour is considering the fact that you are reading the information on each statue, taking pictures, and hanging out at the tea shop. \n\nThe tea cafe is at the center of the garden, with different traditional japanese teas such as the genmaicha and the sencha, or even a different touch of strong green tea shots (described to be much like green tea espresso shots). There are also snacks to pair with the teas, such as mochi, green tea crackers, tea cracker assortments, or sesame crackers. The mochi actually ran out on the day I was there, so I am assuming that this is a hot commodity.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-13", "description": "BREWING THE BAY: Abbreviated Japanese chakai ceremony (macha tea)\n\nUPDATE: Regarding the Japanese tea ceremony that is offered here, it can best be described as a sort of \"nodate meets chakai\" ceremony without the traditional awning of cherry blossoms over you (since the ceremony is performed under the roof of the cafe). However, if you are less interested in authenticity and more interested in just experiencing hot matcha tea, Japanese sweets and a friendly Japanese hostess in a kimono amidst the gorgeous garden, then this is right for you. \n\nThe ceremony more or less follows the rituals of a chakai, with both koicha (thick matcha) and usucha (thin matcha) prepared. The koicha is poured into one bowl that is passed along and shared by all the guests. The usucha is served to each guest in an individual bowl. The entire ceremony lasts less than an hour and at $25, isn't exactly cheap. However, the hostess's enthusiasm for Japanese tea traditions cannot be questioned. It is very clear that she loves what she does. Plus, participants get to keep a cute little Japanese paper fan as a souvenir. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the ceremony (we had some great, funny, British guests in our group), but I definitely prefer the real deal. 3.5 stars\n\n..........................................\n\nI first visited the Japanese Tea Garden four years ago on a trip to San Fran with my college friend. I remember being awed by its stunning yet simple beauty. There is something about Asian gardens--the exotic flora, the unusual shapes, the different foliage, the overall ambience, that makes them so different from \"Western\" gardens. I will also note that I am the world's most un-photogenic person (I tend to look like an amorphous blob in most pics), but I actually thought I looked decent in the pictures my friend took of me in the garden. Of course, it's pretty much impossible to take a bad photo in this place.\n\nI'm delighted to find that, four years later, the garden is still as beautiful as ever, if not more overrun by tourists. However, if you are strategic about your visit and go during off hours (my suggestion would be a morning/early afternoon on a weekday), you can usually avoid a lot of the crowds. Sipping hot tea while looking out over the garden is surely one of the simplest, most serene pleasures in life.", "author": "Josephine L."}

That was many decades ago so when one of the tea garden's chief gardeners offered us the opportunity to walk through the gardens last Sunday many of us were happy to oblige.\n\nI was among a group of nearly 30 One Brick volunteers who cleaned up an overgrown area of weeds and blackberry behind the Japanese Tea Garden.  Working side by side with three gardeners from the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department we dug out a huge section of assorted weeds, non native plants and overgrown grass exposing the dark, moist soil underneath where some volunteers replanted new plants and trees.  Once replanted we covered up the newly exposed soil with fresh bark brought down from a huge mulch pile nearby while those same volunteers created a fence line using discarded twigs from some of the nearby elm and sycamore trees.\n\nSince I rarely back down from an aerobic challenge I, along with a few other hearty volunteers took on the task of pushing the pulled foliage up a hill via wheelbarrow to a compost pile, discarding our plants and refilling our wheelbarrows with mulch to take back down the hill.  It was a great workout and for over two hours I felt the incredible burn on my arms and my legs.  As is usually the case with One Brick work parties we finished our project in record time.\n\nThe gardens were fairly empty that afternoon.  I think several days of rainfall played a role in keeping many park visitors away, but the sun came out in full bloom that morning / afternoon, and I really enjoyed my time inside the tea garden.\n\nDespite the presence of a few small groups of visitors the garden was relatively quiet while I was there.  I enjoyed the peace so much that when a core group of our volunteers walked away to grab some lunch nearby I stayed behind in the tea garden.  The hot sun felt good on my tired muscles, and I loved the sound created by the two little waterfalls inside along with the chirping birds and the occasional rush of wind.\n\nMost of the visitors seemed respectful of each other by speaking softly and moving around slowly.  During my visit, I took a load of photos entirely without the presence of other visitors in my compositions.  \n\nSome things like the Japanese Tea Garden I take for granted having lived in San Francisco all my life, but it's times like I experienced last Sunday that helps me realize what a special city I live in.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

One of my MUST GO-TO places was this--Japanese Tea Garden. I had high expectations but.. I hadn't realized how almost un-Japanese this is!\n\nI went during my spring break from school with a few other friends and drove from Westminster (part of Orange County) to San Fran. It was rainy the day we came so we went a day after. (Long ago review but I remember it like it was yesterday.) We came on a Saturday and scourged for parking. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU COME SUPER EARLY. Parking was IMPOSSIBLE. People were even parking illegally because there was not enough room to park! \n\nThe garden entrance fee costs 7$ for non-SF residents and 5$ for those who are. The fee booth looks pretty similar to the toll booths in Japan but slightly modern--this is speaking about parks that is. I've honestly never seen so many rude, misinformed and irresponsible parents and tourists in my life. Actually I have but this REALLY bothered me. \n\nFirst off, the water in the supposedly koi ponds was copper yellow. Which in returns mean, probably many years ago they had fish. Until the idiot who threw pennies and coins into the pond came along. You don't do that! A traditional Japanese garden will have fish in it, and because people are so.. \"LETS THROW PENNIES IN BODIES OF WATER\" there aren't any. I was looking forward to seeing hundreds of koi fishes. Shot down. \n\nThe walk ways became packed and parents can't seem to watch their kids. There was trash in a couple of places that I saw and it really irked me. So being a person that I am I picked it up. Only to see the parents littering as well (F word). \n\nThere stone garden was well-kept for such a busy place as were most of the greenary that most tourist didn't touch or have their kids throw things there. \n\nThe tea-house itself is pretty much mediocre. The tea is soaked in such hot water that the tea tasted bitter (which means improper preparation of tea). Ordering was a hassle because you never knew who was taking your order and didn't know if the person taking your order knew what you wanted. Pricy tea as well. I'd prefer you go when it is nearly dead-early morning- or on a weekday... early morning. \n\nBah it saddens me to see such a beautiful garden not in it's pristine condition; however, there are some good photoshoot opportunities here. There's a few replica \"castles\" in the garden as well as a kick-ass bridge.\n\nNext time in SF.. I won't come back.

I forwarded them the picture later, totally loved it.\n\nThe Tea Garden also has a gift shop and a tea shop, mostly for the Asian-fawning tourists, but I digress. So overall, I love the visit. Was it worth $7? perhaps. I will visit again next time I'm in SF, but perhaps on the free visiting hours.", "author": "Kuanyu C."}

We were here for about 90 minutes right after our exhibit window at the de Young.  It was a nice block of time to just relax.\n\n2.  Take the tour.  You are going to learn so much more about the history of this garden, which is of course tied up with our unfortunate history of Japanese internment, but in turn you are going to be so much more grateful for what you see and experience.\n\n3.  Stop at the cafe.  Leave your tour a little bit before it ends so you don't get caught in a bit wait, as the seating space is limited.  Order all kinds of Japanese tea, sandwiches, ramune....you name it.  I got stuffed.", "author": "Stephen H."}

We read that it was free on Monday/Wednesday/Fridays, and of course we were there on a Thursday.\n\nThere were certainly a lot of people around.  But it didn't seem so crowded as the paths are quaint.  A lot of scenic photo ops, and a lot of koi fish to watch.  However, I was a little annoyed about the moon bridge dilemma.  It was hard to get a picture on top of it, when everyone else decides to join in too!\n\nWe also visited the tiny gift shop, and the service there was so cute!  The cashiers always had a smile on their face and it made my experience there heartwarming.  The tea house was a little crowded and the menus are a little stale, but the service was pleasing.  They brought the food to you, restaurant-style.  I had the green tea ice cream and a taiyaki (fish cake), which was amazing.\n\nOverall, cute place.

That being said, I thought it costs entirely too much for what it is.  You pay something like 7 dollars per person at the door to walk around a relatively small area.  Not only that but besides the garden with the regular fare of shrines and the tea house, there really wasn't much to it that would make you forget you're in San Francisco.  A temple with a local sect of shinto or buddhist monks would do wonders for this place as a learning experience in addition to the aesthetics of the flora.\n\nI was also at the tea house inside the garden and was surprised at the lack of authenticity and freshness.  Their food is pre-made in exact portions and refrigerated/stored away.  You can tell this because their rice crackers stick to the bottom of the bowls.  This tells me that they just sit there in the bowls all day.  The rice in their onigiri is also a telltale sign of being made long before serving because it's dry and hard.  Their matcha latte is not bad but I was startled to find that they do not have freshly made matcha tea itself.  If there's one kind of tea a Japanese tea house IN a tea garden must have, it's gotta be traditional matcha.

It's always a fun time exploring. \n\nWhen you walk in, there are plenty of pathways leading to different areas of the garden. Each area has beautiful plants, sublime flowers, ponds and bridges. You'll get a feeling of relaxation from coming here. It's a pleasant place to go to if you need to collect your thoughts and unwind. I enjoy coming here to catch up with a friend or two as well as take photos.\n \nThey have a neat little area where they'll serve you a tea of your choice, with crackers and yummy cookies. You can sit down at a small table and chat with a friend while enjoying the wonderful scenery. It's especially nice when it's a sunny, warm day. I'd recommend ordering the green tea; it's amazing. \n\nThe tea garden is located at a great spot. There's street parking as well as garages.

However,  I would still recommend it because the pagodas are beautiful; the layout is gorgeous and allows you to appreciate the garden and pagodas from all different angles; the bridges are super cute; and when I went it was Spring so the cherry blossom trees were in full bloom. It was gorgeous. There are little (koi) ponds and streams set through out the garden and a nice, little food and patio area within the garden. They were serving limited but traditional Japanese food and green tea ice cream.  There was also a small gift shop nearby. During my visit, it began to rain so hard that I had to go find shelter under the pagoda, but the garden is so colorful that the reflection of the rain only emphasized it's vibrant colors. My only wish is that it was bigger (even Fresno's Japanese Garden is bigger, I think) but if you are in the area, definitely go check it out. I don't know if it would be worth it to make a trip there solely for the garden but if you are in the area, it is definitely a nice complimentary trip.", "author": "Hu L."}

I really liked the idea of it, which leads me to believe that I created this dream in my head that it would be better than what I experienced. It wasn't a bad visit but I would have rather gone during one of the free admission days. The $8 is a bit overpriced for what we saw. It is a small garden and unfortunately, one section of it was closed due to construction. The greenery was very beautiful and the architecture was nice to look at, but that was it. We went through the garden in about 30 minutes or so, maybe one hour tops. I suppose I imagined there would be a sitting area for visitors to lay around, drink tea and enjoy the nature. The gift shop was very cute. We bought some mango chews (like Starburst but better!). The tea house didn't offer much in terms of variety for tea or food. I was a bit disappointed but I think it's because I was expecting something else, expecting more. Definitely worth a visit on one of the free admission days.

I was finally able to go today with my boyfriend and I must say, it was worth every penny at $7 dollars per non-San Francisco-addressed adult. Otherwise, it would be $5. We arrived at the garden around 4PM and the sun was still beaming, a perfect San Francisco day for an outing.  \n \nThis place is actually a lot bigger than I anticipated, enough for you to venture to every corner of the fenced establishment.  Within the Japanese garden, I would say this one is a lot better than the Huntington Library in Southern California in terms of having more lush plants and several ponds and small trickling waterfalls. In addition, they have a blood-orange pagoda, a extremely curvacious bridge that you are able to ascend by climbing, and several decorated entrance pillars. \n  \nSurprisingly, there is a little shop within that sells little trinkets, figurines, snacks, and wind chimes. I thought this was an adorable touch to the Japanese garden. \n  \nFurthermore, the tea garden of course has a tea room which has an outdoor-patio seating. Obliging to the sign, you grab a menu and seat yourself. They will come take your order. We ordered the masubi plate which was about $6. It came with one dumpling, some diced teriyaki chicken, and three rice rolls. Small proportions. \n \nWe also ordered the Sanyeo tea that comes in a pot. If you get the combo for another $1.95, you can get those japanese crackers or three pieces of mochi (not the ice cream kind). \n \nI had an exceptionally great time here for my first time.

A half-dozen tourists gawked at a squirrel as it wandered through the grounds. Apparently that was the biggest attraction.\n\nThe place itself has pleasing landscapes but nothing truly inspiring. While it's relatively small, they manage to confuse visitors by offering myriad branching pathways. This non-linear experience is confusing rather than exciting. Did I miss anything? How do I get over there? Usually, GPS comes optional at these places. I have no motivation to come back and visit again.\n\nThe price is also absurd. For a relatively small and underwhelming garden, I thought $5 would have been fairer.

The reality didn't exactly fit my highly romantic fantasy image, but it's still a beautiful place to visit. I would definitely recommend that people go visit during the free hours (between 9AM-10AM, Monday/Wednesday/Friday) rather than pay full admission though ($7/adult).\n\nIt's relatively small (the boyfriend and I walked the entire thing within about 30 minutes, and that was at an extremely leisurely pace with plenty of stops to take photos). The ponds are filled with beautiful (and extremely well-fed) koi fish, there are a few large and weathered pagodas scattered amongst the trees, little stone shrines tucked away in every corner and a large Buddha statue. There is also a tiny gift shop filled with Japanese knick knacks -- everything from chopstick holders to wind chimes to kimonos. We chose not to buy anything (tourist traps, man, they overcharge you on EVERYTHING).\n\nWe did, however, check out their little tea shop -- we each chose a different tea to try out (the Genmai and the Sencha; both of which were delicious but not exactly worth their $7-9 price tag) and they came along with your choice of salty rice crackers (looked straight out of a bag of Japanese trail mix) or mochi cakes (delicious but sticky). We also got the miso soup (nothing special) and a spam musubi (large, but also nothing special). I had wanted their cookie platter initially, but had been told that they were out of cookies that morning. The tea shop is lovely overall, with the open-air dining experience and all that, but it's not really worth the price tag they stick on it (though we were surprisingly full afterward).\n\nI would go again, but not until the cherry blossoms are in bloom and definitely only during their free admission hours as well.", "author": "Anna W."}

However stale as these snacks may be, try and restrain yourself from feeding it to the local water fowl, as they've grown quite bold (and foul tempered) from the frequent feedings from guests.\n\nFun fact:  Not that it really matters, but the ladies working at this joint are actually of Chinese descent.

They have this cool bridge that is so steep that you practically have to climb up to the top and then climb down. It's like a bridge/ladder hybrid - and yes, it's a good photo op.

I saw a zen garden . . . that visitors couldn't go near, let alone rake.\n\nThe trouble is that GG park is itself so majestic, stunning, and filled with beautiful, varied nature, the Japanese Tea Garden doesn't blow me away. It took half an hour to walk through and explore, tops, and that's with taking our time, stopping to look, pausing to sit and enjoy the sunshine, etc. Nothing blew me away, and a lot of time was spent awkwardly trying not to get in people's pictures. This might be a nice spot to look around, then sit down and read somewhere for hours on end, but not as a fascinating tourist destination. All the kids I saw inside were bored, and many of the adults liked it for pretty photo opportunities and nothing more. I agree that the gift shop isn't much to look at, but I actually highly recommend the over-crowded, over-priced caf\u00e9. I grew up drinking tea, and I thought the hojicha (roasted green tea) was great and the green tea cheesecake even better. Perfect creamy texture, with the green tea taste emerging once you swallow, so you have to eat slowly. The one thing I tried and didn't like was the mochi, which tasted bland and thicker in texture than other mochi I've tried, though I'm by all means no authentic mochi expert.

Since that time, we pretty much make a point of visiting here everywhere time we visit Golden Gate Park.  It costs like $5 to get in, and another $5 to sit and enjoy a pot of tea and some little treats while looking out over a big coy pond. \n\nWe stroll around the gardens eating japanese candies we've purchased from the little store.

I love Golden Gate Park and it would have been spectacular to have a peaceful place to have tea and snacks. However, there are a few problems with the Tea Garden. The first is the admissions price. It's $7 or $5 for SF residents (adults). I normally don't have an issue with entrance fees if you get what you pay for and in this regard the Tea Garden sorely disappoints. The grounds aren't very nice. In fact, I would say that the overall landscaping in the park is done better than what's inside the Tea Garden. For those visiting or residents that want to check it out for themselves I would highly recommend coming during the free hour after they open at 9am to 10am, 3 days a week. \n\nFor the Tea Garden itself my wife and I sampled the udon noodles, Mochi cake, green tea cookie platter, Jasmine Tea, and another tea (I forgot the name of her tea). The udon noodles were subpar. The broth was good but the noodles tasted like the run of the mill freeze dried out of the package kind - in other words bad ($9). The green tea cookie plater comes with 3 green tea cookies with nuts and 4 small short bread style cookies ($5) - the short bread cookies were good but the green tea cookies were too dry. The mochi cake was excellent ($3) - moist, flavorful and not too sweet. My jasmine tea was steeped too long - tasted astringent. My wife liked her tea. \n\nI would not recommend the Japanese Tea Garden - for those who must go save yourself some money and go during the free hour and skip the tea house itself \n\nFood: Mediocre at best. 2 stars\n\nService: Quick but don't expect anything like a true tea house experience. 3 stars\n\nAmbiance: Sadly not what was expected. Nice ponds but the landscaping is subpar. 2 stars\n\nOverall: Not recommend. 2 stars", "author": "Sam P."}

I've walked past the Japanese Tea Garden during previous visits to Golden Gate Park and have always wanted to check it out, so finally got the opportunity last Friday. We got there around 2pm, and the park was busy but it wasn't as crazy as it is during the weekends. I was able to find a parking spot on the nearby street right away, and there wasn't much of a line for the Tea Garden. We walked around for 10 minutes and basically covered most of the garden! This is one of the smallest tea gardens I've ever seen, and they didn't have a Zen garden area that visitors could rake. I didn't feel like I saw that many coi fish, and I really wish they sold coi food so that you could feed them. The garden was really pretty, but the scenery wasn't so gorgeous that I felt compelled to take any photos.

Many many parts of the garden are not even tended to that well.  It's all very sloppy.  I have been to other Japanese Gardens all over the world and THOSE were spectacular.  This San Francisco version is just not very interesting and is very small.\n\nYes, if you are local go right at 9am to get in for free...After 10am, it costs.  I had to prove I was a local and what they mean is that your DRIVER'S LICENSE says that you are from SAN FRANCISCO.  East bay doesn't count, Sacramento doesn't count, not even Daly City.\n\nAgain, I know it might be something that people have recommended for you to see, there is a VERY old Buddha with an interesting history and there is a pagoda structure displayed at the Pacific American International Exposition in 1915.  Those you can see pictures of online.\n\nThey of course want you to stay and buy from the gift shop, buy tea, and buy sushi lunch.  Honestly, without rushing, you can walk on every path and be out of there in 15 minutes, and that's with a trip to the bathroom.\n\n...there are big fat coy in all the waterways...which are really algae full and cloudy, wasn't really tranquil at all.  There is a lot of green, but that again goes with the generic part.  Sorry!  If you check out, even pictures online, of Butchart Gardens in Victoria British Columbia, you will understand my standards, but just their Japanese Garden section (one of about 20 areas of the Garden) makes it worth admission.  Everywhere you look, there is attention to detail, constant grooming, beauty, flowers, rock gardens, structures, bridges, stepping stones across crystal clear creeks!\n\nSorry San Fran, but this \"Local\" has brought her last tourist to the garden...but if someone really begs me, I'll drop them off at 9am, they can get back in my car at 9:15am and then we'll go to breakfast...", "author": "Lacey P."}

Yay for the Holidays!\n\nWe weren't the only ones taking advantage of the free admission.  The garden is quite full of people, especially families (who else can get up this early?)  \n\nClean water in the ponds, trees are nicely trimmed.  The garden is quite adorable. \n\nThe tea house has a pretty view of the pond and I like that it's very open and you can sit facing the pond.  It's really a perfect date place.  Serene, casual and comfortable.  My husband had a hoji tea and I had a genmai cha.  The tea set is $4.50 which comes with three pieces of mochi.  The mochi was not bad.  I wasn't expecting an awe-inspiring culinary experience here, given the touristy nature of the location, and reading about the controversy over ownership changes made me realize that it's not owned by Japanese.  Even the waiter was an older white gentleman who thinks genmai cha has a lot of caffeine.  So if you are here trying to immerse yourself in authentic Japanese culture, you may face some disappointment.\n\nBut still, it could have been a whole lot more gimmicky than what it is now: simple and nice.  As long as they don't end up with a Benihana here, I am happy enough.  And I don't really care if the owners are of Japanese descent or not.", "author": "Candice B."}

She has been gone for several years now, but her spirit is never stronger than when I am outside looking at a beautifully executed landscape and surrounded by nature.\n\nShe went to school to study landscape architecture at a time when that was a very unusual profession for women to persue.  And while she never practiced as an architect, she was very involved with the Chicago Botanical Garden and we spent many Sundays there looking at trees and flowers and especially the Japanese garden as the perfect example of man crafting nature to create a new and balanced aesthetic.\n\nTourists are usually fascinated by the bridge, the pagoda, the big Buddha, the tea house, and the gift shop.  These things are nice (minus the gift shop, which is overpriced and not that interesting) and make great pictures, but now that I have visited several times, I like to look at the different plants and the layout of the garden, as well as the intricate details.  I almost never go to the gift shop or the tea house any more - that is where you find the most tourists, and I like to have a more introspective experience.\n\nWhen looking at the various sculptures, make sure that you read the plaques - many of the items were donated and their origins are interesting - rather than some places where they install copies to look like the real thing.\n\nIt's beautiful in any weather - during spring with the colorful blooms, on a foggy winter's day where it takes on a mystical quality, or at any time.  Dusk is especially enchanting, as the shadows created by the different plants take on almost a magical effect, and there are less people there.\n\nAnd if I listen closely, I can hear my grandmother's voice whispering to me about the pattern formed by the branches or the Latin names of the various plants, and it makes me smile both outside and inside.", "author": "Liz S."}

Sorry, but this is too spendy for my working-class ethic, especially since we used to have to trek thru' here yearly on school field trips. And the whole school probably got in for $25.00!! Anyway, we arrived at the Japanese Tea Garden on one of the most breathtaking December afternoons I can recall...not crowded, quiet, and the ginko leaves on the pond with the carp floating silently along were just so amazing. Truly poetic. \n\nNo stop is complete without a snack, so we availed ourselves of the tea house. We shared a pot of brown rice tea and a bowl of cookies & spicy crackers with nuts...Nuts??

Granted, the tea service is extremely basic: you get a choice of jasmine, green, or oolong, and it comes with a bowl of cracker-cookie snacks.  So don't be expecting Samovar or Lovejoy's.  But the fact that they actually go to the trouble of serving it at all is good enough for me.

I swear, when I went there there was this group of kids (I'd say around 14-17) just running around treating it like it was their yard!  Ugh!!! Complete way to ruin the mood and serenity of the situation. \n\nA little more disconcerting is the entry fee ($5, cash only, with some free days) which while not exorbitant, is kind of a small sting, especially if you get stuck paying for parking (we managed to find a space nearby).  Even more disconcerting is the tea shop.  This is going to sound bad, but at the Tea Shop, Cantonese can be clearly heard as the waitresses mill around.  It's not bad-- everyone's gotta get employees and with so many Chinese folks in San Fran, it's bound to happen, but for me (or anyone who doesn't lump us all together with a dismissive \"them Orientuhls\"), it's a moment of cognitive dissonance, made worse when you realize that the tea they serve you is CHINESE.  We passed on the $4 per person tea.\n\nIn addition, skip the gift shop unless you want something specifically from the Tea Garden-- most of the souvenirs are dinky trinkets from Chinatown, and you're better off driving a few blocks down to Irving street, enjoying some Chinese food and tea, and getting those knick knacks there.  \n\nOverall, this is a great experience.

I mean the only direction you can shoot and *not* catch something is *maybe* straight up. \n\nThen, after you're all done, you could like upload and post all your shots onto one web site.. and then everybody could look and download the shots they liked for themselves.. like wouldn't that be a good thing to do?", "author": "Weide Z."}

Seems like they could even be selling other items such as nice vases or appetizer plates from Japan, or sembei or arare or Japanese green tea and cute paper balls, or Japanese rice paper or books.\n\nWhy is the entrance fee as high as it is, it has already been paid for the past 70 years hasn't it?

It's easy to forget about all these tranquil spots in the city when you live close to the downtown area...and your life is taken over by cable car sounds and trips to H&M.\n\nFirst of all, of course it's touristy. So you just have to let it go and act like a tourist yourself. Waterfalls! Tiny bridges! Exotic plants! Be sure to \"oooh\" and \"ahhh\" like the best of them and bust out that camera if you are really feeling it. \n\nThe tea house is very cute and feels like something out of an old movie. Paper lanterns and an assortment of Japanese snacks tie it all together. Tea choices are limited (green, jasmine, etc.) but it will help you relax, even with all the chaos around you. And by chaos, I mean the crazy birds that fly so low you feel like you are going to get pecked in the head...\n\nBe sure to check it out if you haven't been before.

Answer: you don't go into the Japanese Tea Garden until you have a friend visiting from out-of-state.\n\nWhich comes to my first visit ever to the inside of the Japanese Tea Garden, after having gone by it any millions of times over the years. \nA funny part of the visit was ordering. Besides tea, my friend got us some ice cream to share. One pink and one green little ball on a little rectangular plate. We could not figure out how to eat them! We tried to use the chocolate sticks they are served with, but they only proceeded to break when we tried to puncture the ice cream. Then we figured out that the ice cream part was covered by a doughy ball, not unlike the texture of play dough. To eat it, we had to squeeze the ball, peel away the dough to get at the ice cream inside. It was a messy endeavor without napkins and wasn't a treat we'd recommend, but it was an amusing adventure for sure. A much safer bet are the oriental cracker mix (tasted like it could've been that Trader Joes mix) and fortune cookies (huh?) that come with the tea. \n\nYou have to get past the tourist trap $7 entry fee ($5 only if you live within city of SF, no bordering city counts), but it's worth it to hang out for as long as you want in the serene gardens. My visiting yogi friend and I met up with another yogi who lives across the Golden Gate, and we literally spent several hours sitting, strolling, taking in the ambiance, a Zen-like backdrop for some amazing discussions. Not everyone is as lucky to get knowledgeable yogis to accompany them in this beautiful space, but the combination of the surroundings and company made for a tremendously wonderful day for me. \n\nSo whomever your company, soak up the peaceful environment, play the fortune cookie game, and enjoy!", "author": "Megan K."}

The tuna tea sandwich was too salty in my opinion. The vegetable egg thingy sandwich was too sticky. My mouth was slobbered with mushes of sandwich, The ham sandwich was pretty good, but it was just two pieces of bread with mayo and ham. Not worth my dollars.\n\nYou have to pay a small price to get admission. I would prefer free (because we are cheap :P) but it's just a few dollars per person.  \n\nSummary:\n\n     I would really recommend this place to anyone, it's an amazing sight to see.", "author": "Nell A."}

But when I arrived, the sign posted outside the garden noted it opened a little later--by 30 minutes. A dear soul working outside the gate who could apparently tell I had my garden game face on, opened the gate and then closed it behind me. I enjoyed true peace and tranquility in the company of a few artists and photographers, who were spontaneously dedicated to giving one another their own piece of the garden. We all moved about unobtrusively, with appreciative nods, all without speaking. As a result, I blew through the memory card in my camera in about 15 minutes. An amused colleague emailed me his Chihuly shots the following day.  \n\nOn mnypny's Bliss Spectrum, this place rates right up there with a Dave Brubeck, Tony Bennett, or Hives concert--wildly smile-inducing to the point of frightening small children and animals.

Japanese :D  However, the gift shop completely ruined the experience for me.  It felt like they grabbed one of those cheesy Chinese gift stores from Chinatown (you know... the ones where everything is 50 cents and looks like it'll fall apart when you look at it).  I was disappointed that they would ruin the atmosphere by having this there... at least get rid of the windows so I can't see all the tourists drooling over cheap trinkets that they'll realize they really don't want as soon as they leave.\n\nThe tea shop was neat, though much too small, and way too westernized.  I was expecting to sit outside, around a calm pond with large sitting areas and chat with my friends, but we all ended up smashing together in the corner of the shop (which was all just poorly painted brown wooden benches and stools) and tried (though failed miserably) not to accidentally bump into the other tea-goers around me.

It's a cute place to take tourists, or take yourself if you want a  change from the ordinary.  Go late in the afternoon, when it's free, that way you can save your money for the tea.  It's pricey, but of pretty high quality.  Take it in slowely, breathe in the heady scents of the tea as you gaze over the Koi pond.  Take just a moment to relax and unwind from your day.  Munch on the plate of various snacks they give you, and finish up the snack with your fortune cookie.

Here's a quote relating to the change of concession: \n\"Supporters say the change will transform what is now mainly a tourist spot that serves Chinese fortune cookies and sells generic souvenirs i\n\"I am hopeful that the Tea Garden will return to a more authentic Japanese American tradition,\" said Douglas Dawkins, a panel member and great-great grandson of Makoto Hagiwara, who originally designed much of the garden.\"\nDREAM ON Folks!  The tea house is now a 100& cash cow tourist attraction. My order was taken by a completely disinterested and fairly surly young white man, and served by another white man, who slammed down my single cup of tea and 3 tiny cookies very rudely.  He seemed outraged when I asked for sugar (I was sharing with a small child), and brought it with no stirring stick.  Then when I got up to get one, he started yelling at me.  If anything could be farther from the concept of having tea in a Japanese tea garden than their behavior and attitude, I do not know what it would be.  \n\nEnjoy the garden and skip the tea is my advice.", "author": "Nana R."}

With its statues and the plethora of flora surrounding you, your blood pressure would surely go down. It's definitely a great place to relax, meditate, and get a few \"ohms\" out of your system or you can even find some peace of mind by climbing the bridge which is always fun. After you've had your little slice of nirvana you can grab some tea from the teahouse, which is pretty pricey for a pot and a couple of rice crackers on the side. It's relaxing until the birds start flocking to your side. Then the squirrels. Then the other forest creatures. It was like being in a scene in Snow White where all the animals gather.

Everything is pretty and all but it only takes 15 minutes max to walk around and see everything if you are walking slowly. You are basically spending $7 to go to a Japanese novelty store where they charge you money for a black and white printout map of the place (I do not recommend getting this because if you are spending that much money to get in, you might as well explore it on your own considering its small size). The items are also way over priced when comparing to an average Japanese novelty store in Japan Town. You also get to eat/drink at their cafe located in the center right next to the gift shop, for more money of course. Honestly, if you want to experience some Japanese culture, shop, and eat, just spend the extra gas money to drive 10-15 minutes to Japan Town which is free to get in. I can understand maybe going here during a time when everything is in full bloom, however I went here in mid May and there was really nothing to look at except koi in a dirty man made pond. I'd also like to note that there is a cool bridge that you have to climb up that offers a nice view of the area, however there is usually a line of tourists trying to climb up so the wait time can be ridiculous. The place also looks like it isn't very well maintained because paint is chipped off and faded and many things there are rusted.", "author": "Jan K."}

I've taken friends from Hong Kong, New York City, other parts of California and Colorado here, and they've all loved it! It's a delicious oasis of calm. I've come in all seasons and I love how the colors change here. Different flowers, different plants are always flourishing. The leaves on the trees change with the seasons. In fog or sunlight, a light drizzle or a strong wind can bring a completely different feel to the garden and makes each visit unique. I avoid the tea house and shop, and prefer to admire the work of the Hagiwara family who first tended the lovely garden until they were sent to internment camps during WWII in 1942. There is a small placque near the entrance that mentions the Hagiwara familly but doesn't explain why they suddenly stopped being in charge of the garden in 1942. There is a traditional zen rock garden, shinto-type shrine with gated space (to separate the sacred from the mundane), koi ponds, giant redwoods, Japanese maples, a bamboo grove, bronze Buddha, and lovely moon bridge. It is a relatively small space and meant to be viewed leisurely so that the different garden scapes can be appreciated. Seflishly, I admit I'm happy the higher admission price seems to be deterring some visitors. I prefer visiting when it is not crowded.

In fact it is embarassing that someone who might not know better is given such a wrong impression of the Japanese culture.  Enjoy the garden, but keep in mind that a) there is no one (at least when I was there) who is Japanese that works in that tea house b) the outfits they are wearing is in no sense mildly close to being a \"kimono\" c) the mannerisms are NOT classically Japanese at all and finally d) the tea pots and the dishes are something that the Japanese prize.  The cheap unmatching teapots and tea cups should never be used.  ...and finally e) the Japanese ony drink green tea or a form of green tea and nothing else.  The crap they serve there is like calling grade D beef that they serve at Taco Bell, filet mignon at Ruth Chris.  ...I could go on and on, but it really is so embarassing....   it's like if i went abroad and went to an american style restaurant and they hung the US flag upside down-- and everything they served had ketchup on it.  ...I wish they'd re-vamp that tea house or give a different name to the building and don't even try to be a \"Japanese Tea House\".  It is so insulting.", "author": "Kelly C."}
