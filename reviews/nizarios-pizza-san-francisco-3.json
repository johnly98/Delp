He kinda laughed at first, but respect is earned, right? I told him that I've been craving handmade pizza and seeing the whole process made me hungry, especially after seeing a friend walk out of the place very satisfied. Ultimately, he took the time to listen to me and discuss the ingredients with me. I gave him my money, and he gave me a customized handmade pizza pie with olive oil, oregano, extra tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. Let me tell ya... I'm gonna be coming here at least once every couple of weeks to get my pizza fix. The service alone made this 5-star review.

The place seems a little dingy, but also expected. I've dined in a couple times. Most times, I've just taken my pizza to go. The lines can get fairly long in the after-hours, but other times, there isn't much of a wait.\n\nThe pizza is good, but not the best. The crust is average and I don't have anything in particular to say about the toppings. It's a pretty average slice of pizza. I enjoy the Nizario's Special (pepperoni, mushrooms, red onion,  green bell peppers) and the California Special (pepperoni, sausage, Canadian bacon, black olives, feta cheese). \n\nOverall, I don't have anything bad to say about this place.

I don't use the word worst lightly since I know full well there can only be one \"worst\" and I say unreservedly this pizza is it.  Tiny dried up sad pepperoni, nasty tasting barely seasoned crust, terrible sauce, minimal cheese...it's almost an art form how bad this pizza was.  Like they're the Michelangelo of bad pizza and this is the Sistine chapel of nasty awful Italian travesty.  \n\n Beyond that the place looks gross and rundown, the soda tasted nearly flat which means it was probably stored poorly and lost carbonation.  Insult to injury.  \n\nRemember that old adage \"pizza is like sex, even when it's bad it's still good\"?  This place was like the pizza equivalent of being with a person made of sandpaper and waking up with crabs.  It singlehandedly proves that adage wrong in the worst way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-20", "description": "For being such a small place, they crank out some pretty good quality pizza (either by the slice, or a whole pie).  It's not so much that their flavor combinations are so extraordinary, but in my opinion, their crust is pretty exceptional.  Their crust is flavorful and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and not greasy at all.  \n\nAlthough, there have been occasions where I've ordered a whole pie and the crust hasn't been crunchy enough (at least for my preference).  What I do when this happens is just pop it into my own oven for a little longer, to crisp it up even more.    \n\nNow when you're ordering an individual slice, they normally heat up the slice by putting it in their oven where your slice takes a short little ride on the oven's conveyor belt.  Sometimes though, they give you a slice right out of the glass case because they \"just made it and it's still warm\", but believe me, it's worth waiting a little longer, for a crisper crust and goozey cheese, so just ask them to heat it up in the oven for you.\n\nI normally get the Nizario's combination.  It's the general crowd pleaser because it has all the ingredients you would get on your average deluxe pizza (i.e. pepperoni, sausage, green bell peppers, and onions, etc).  \n\nIf you're short on time and want some solidly good pizza fast, this is a good place to go.", "author": "Danielle O."}

Its piping hot, has plenty of toppings, and the sauce is nice and zesty.

Not my first choice in pizzerias but Golden Boy was closed. I got a slice of pesto pie to go but it was unflinchingly and apologetically greasy.

First chicken, then Mexican, and now pizza.  I hope Nizario's is here to stay!\n\nIt's a local chain, with other locations in the Castro and the Richmond district.  Location is convenient and open until 2 am seven days a week.  Decor is basic, but clean and comfortable with seating in the back.  Guys working the counter were super friendly, fast, and efficient.\n\nBut most importantly - the pizza...it's solid!  As a New Yorker, I have high standards for pizza and this is in the top 5 slices I've had in SF.  Crust is fairly thick and bubbly with a light dusting of cornmeal at the bottom, with a nice ratio of sauce to cheese to crust.  I liked it!  I think this will be my new go-to spot for a quick bite on the way home from work.  Yum...", "author": "Jaimie M."}

After a night trying to balance yourself in some super tall heels in heights comparable to the shoes of many of the young ladies employed in certain show businesses here, you neeeeed a break from walking, and maybe something to eat too. Conveniently slapped dabbed on the corner is Nizaro's Pizza..... YUM. To be honest, I didn't expect this place to have such good pizza, nor be close to clean. Surprisingly they've got that perfect crust, soft yet a little crispy at the same time. The cheese was just the right amount, and the toppings were top top baby! Mmmm I'm getting hungry thinking about the pizza here.  The guys that work here are super friendly too, they don't rush you into deciding what you want. They also say thank you when you leave (which I noticed saying thank you after eating and leaving is becoming rare these days!). The price of a slice depends on what you get, make sure you have at least $4 ready to spend for a slice, but it's extremely worth it.
