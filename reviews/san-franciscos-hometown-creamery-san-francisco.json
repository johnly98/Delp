This was a genius idea sans the beer. \n\nIt was just around the block from Irving and one block from where we parked on 9th Avenue. We crossed our fingers that there wasn't a long line on a Friday night and our wish came true. The exterior of the place had a warm and inviting look to it, and the interior was spacious yet cozy. I love the different neighborhoods represented on the painted murals located on the top walls and decorated with dark-colored wood panels that made it feel homey. \n\nThe menu board is located on the right as you enter the place and it's seasonal and rotational, from what I could gather. But whatever flavors they had, we were ordering the flight. I was hoping they had coffee flavor, but it was not in the rotation. I told Wifey to get the Matcha Green Tea and the Asmaras Weekday Breakfast while she can chose the other three. She included the Centeotl Tribute (corn flavored ice cream named after the Maize Aztec God), Fresh Mint Tea and Schwarzw\u00e4lder Eic (German chocolate). The flight also came with some waffle chips, which was a nice added touch and texture to their ice cream. \n\nWhat can I say? \n\nThey were definitely great to look at and instagram-worthy. But one flavor that stood out the most for us among the five that we chose was the Centeolt Tribute. On their website, the flavor is described as sweet yellow maize with a smokey, sweet, and spicy Chile guajillo caramel swirled through it. If you've never had corn-flavored ice cream before, it's a familiar flavor in our culture and it's often mixed with cheese. Hey, don't knock it til' you try it.\n\nWe liked it so much, we ordered it again to-go with two scoops on a waffle. And guess what, we came back here again the next day and ordered the same thing. \n\nI gotta go back when the coffee flavor is in rotation and try their other flavors, which sounds very exciting as described on their website. \n\nBut the flight is definitely the way to go so you can try five different flavors at once.", "author": "John G."}

About one second into the challenge I knew there was no way at all I would even kind of come close. So I immediately gave up on the challenge and on any aspirations to be the next host of Man vs Food and just decided to slowly enjoy the ice cream. \n\nJust FYI on the challenge...they say 8 scoops of ice cream which seems totally doable (or at least doable to me) but just know that each scoop is 1.5 pounds. Ya, that's right, I said it, 1.5 pounds!! And their ice cream is suuuuuper creamy, delicious but very rich, making it even harder to eat a small baby's worth of ice cream. What I would recommend doing in the future, and probably what most people already do, just go with a group of friends and enjoy the kitchen sink together because it's fun (and yummy!).\n\nEven though this place got the best of me, I love it. The ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from the name, it's got a nice old time-y diner/creamery feel to it. The service is really friendly.

(not that much variety) flavors, which I tried the green tea and watermelon sorbet. The green tea one was great in flavor but I wasn't the biggest fan of the tiny chewy bits of rice crispy cereal that was incorporated into it.

Unfortunately, it was quite disappointing. Not sure if my taste buds weren't working correctly that night, but it honestly tasted like ice cream you would buy from a grocery store...

Gelato, Ube, sundaes...you name it. SF has it all. \n\nI'm usually not a gambler, but I would definitely be willing to bet some $$ on the fact that this glorious city has over 50 different ice cream shops. And the reason why so many of them stay profitable is because each one does something most people have never experienced before. \n\nSan Francisco's Hometown Creamery is the perfect example. Last night, I decided to take my girlfriend here for our anniversary. Despite the fact that SF has so many other insanely popular parlors (e.g. Bi-Rite, Smitten's), this place popped out because of two reasons: 1. It was the first shop in the city that made batches of ice cream from scratch ON-SITE and 2. They have a freaking 5-flavor option for ice cream (!!!). Even though Hometown Creamery wasn't the most amazing parlor of all time, I think we made the right choice. \n\nOne look at their menu and it's clear that Hometown Creamery prioritizes quality over quantity. They serve only 10 flavors, half of which are on a rotating basis. The cool thing though is that these flavors are SO UNIQUE. When we stopped by, they had options like their Surya's Sunshine and La Vie En Rose. Totally never heard of these before. In terms of size, there are like 5-6 different choices (both in cup or waffle cone). For those who are hangry, check out the 5-flavor option (aka the Flight). If you want something other than simple scoops of ice cream, Hometown Creamery also has some drinks, confections, and even sundaes. Personally, I thought prices here were pretty reasonable. Besides the Flight (~$12), don't expect to pay more than $6-7. \n\nMy girlfriend and I ended up ordering a proper double with Madagascar Vanilla and Fresh Mint Chip. Overall, the ice cream was pretty delicious! First off, both flavors were SO FRESH. To me, it felt like I was eating ice cream that had literally just been made. For example, the Mint Chip tasted as though someone had just crushed some mint leaves and somehow magically turned them into ice cream. Second of all, the portion size was just right. For about $6, we got two GIGANTIC scoops. My girlfriend usually loves to eat a lot of ice cream, but even she had to give me most of it. The only big downer about our experience though was the fact that the ice cream needed to be creamier. It was probably because of the freshness, but we both thought it was too light. Nevertheless, SO GOOD!\n\nOn top of the ice cream, my favorite part about Hometown Creamery was the atmosphere. The place was peaceful, music played in the background, and the decor seemed like the perfect choice for a San Francisco shop! More specifically, they had paintings of every SF neighborhood on the walls. The vibe definitely made this a nice place to eat ice cream and have fun.\n\nHometown Creamery is located in the beautiful Inner Sunset neighborhood on the corner of 9th and Irving. On one hand, I really love this spot because the ice cream shop is so close to Golden Gate Park and food heaven. But on the other hand, traffic and parking can be a nightmare 24/7. If you're struggling to find a parking spot, I recommend looking along Golden Gate Park. There are usually some free spaces here and there. \n\nWith its nice ice cream and chill vibe, San Francisco's Hometown Creamery easily makes my list of best ice cream places in the city. If you're in the area and want something unique, I totally recommend this place. I give it a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Sorbet makes me think of fruit, and while college me joked that wine helped me get my daily serving of fruit, chocolate would surely be a stretch.\n\nBut because I am a sucker for anything chocolate, I decided to give the chocolate sorbet flavor a try. Heads up in advance: there's a daily rotating menu of flavors and the online menus aren't always up-to-date. That's something to keep in mind if you're picky when it comes to ice cream, but I believe there might be a few select flavors, such as the chocolate sorbet, that are a permanent fixture on the menu. SFHC is a small local business -- you can tell by the cozy, rustic decor, original art on the walls, and the fact that their ice cream is made by scratch on-site.\n\nNot knowing what to expect from the chocolate sorbet, I was pleasantly surprised by its richness. (Don't get this if you're not a fan of dark chocolate.) The Yelp reviewer who described the flavor as a brownie in sorbet form hit the nail right on the head. Yet the chocolate sorbet flavor wasn't special enough to warrant paying $3.95 for a single scoop -- I wish I had gotten the slightly smaller smidge (Hometown Creamery's smallest scoop). If anything, know that you'll get your money's worth with the single scoop if you pick the right flavor (or really, come on the right day). The homemade waffle cone was delicious and had a subtle spice kick to it, which complemented the ice cream well.", "author": "Amy C."}

It was perfect for me since I always like to split scoops in order to maximize on my trip to flavortown without OD'ing on ice cream. I opted for a double smidge in a waffle cone with the banoffee and the roasted black sesame with white miso caramel (double ZOMG!). The banoffee ice cream had a genuine banana flavor with large chunks of shortbread (impressively large chunks) and delicious dark chocolate toffee pieces, it was a great balance of salty and sweet. I am a moth drawn to the flame whenever I encounter black sesame, needless to say I've tried many versions!! However, this one really stood out because of the white miso caramel. It added definite sweetness but was oh so miso-y. Bravo!\n\nThe waffle cone was bomb. Clearly fresh, a little sugary. I will say the ice cream seemed to melt rather rapidly. So I ended up eating it a lot quicker than I'd prefer. This creamery has got the A flavor game for sure but the texture is not on the same level of smooth creaminess as say Garden. \n\nOverall, truly delicious and well worth a stop if you're in the area.

Although it's not the cheapest, but split amongst five or six people, it's a pretty good idea.

I sampled the strawberry balsamic and thought it was pretty bland. I didn't taste any hint of balsamic in it-- it seemed like unsweetened light, strawberry ice cream. \n\nI got two smidges of Unity and hibiscus lime ($4.50). Unity was pretty tasty, although not well-mixed. I had a large nob of purple-colored cornbread in mine, which size-able relative to the smidge size I got. The hibiscus wayyyy too tangy. I couldn't taste anything in this except the lime. The color was startlingly purple, so the whole smidge was just a wacky experience.", "author": "Julia Y."}

I also tried their Aztec chocolate and that had the perfect amount of spice. The great thing is that they offer a variety of sizes so you don't have to over indulge and commit to a giant scoop of ice cream. You can either get their little size and or even order their ice cream flight. The ice cream was creamy and flavors were bold and strong. The way I like it. The smallest scoops start at less than 3 dollars. They also have a rotating selection of sorbets. Great date spot.", "author": "Diane T."}

There were string lights up on the windows, and it made the whole interior feel so warm. Also, there was a cool map where people could place tacks on where they were from! Very cute.\n\nWhat I Ordered:\n\n-The Flight (4/5, $11.95): The flavors we ordered from left to right are Vanilla Madasgacar, Alfajores, Hibiscus Sorbet, Cookies and Cream, and Rocky Road. They were all delicious! One flavor that really stuck out was the hibiscus--it was extremely refreshing. The Vanilla was also amazingly rich! It was also a lot more ice cream than I was anticipating, which was great. Also very cute and useful that you get waffle cone bits with the flight! They tasted great when dipped in the ice cream. I really like the concept of the ice cream flights--you get a decent amount of ice cream, plus you get to try five different flavors. The sorbet was a little bit icy, but very flavorful. \n\nCustomer Service: The cashier up front was very sweet, giving us lots of samples with a smile, until we said that we'd like to order a flight. Her smile immediately dropped from her face and she looked vaguely annoyed that she'd have to arrange another flight. I get that it takes a lot of precision, but it is their signature item so I feel like our request shouldn't have been out of the ordinary. To be fair, it was late, and she might have had an off day, so I understand, but it was still a little bit off putting and made me uncomfortable. (-1 star)\n\nAll in all, the ice cream here is great! Honestly, besides the flight, I don't really see much that differentiates this creamery from the rest of the San Francisco ice cream shops (and there are many haha). It is definitely in a convenient spot though--if you're grabbing food nearby on Irving Street, you should swing by for dessert!", "author": "Stephanie N."}

They've found their stride.\n\nNow, I love Bi-Rite's Salted Caramel, Marco Polo's Taro, Three Twin's Cardamom, Polly Ann's Jasmine Tea, S&S's Tres Leche, and Smitten's Chocolate Tcho, but there's something about the freshness of Hometown Creamery's ice cream that truly transcends every single one of these. It must be the small-batches + an inventiveness not like the flavor-bombs at S&S, but far more simple, and real. \n\nLike Alice Waters said, someone open an ice cream shop that is Northern California, please. And God said, okay, Hometown Creamery. Because God listens deeply to Alice Waters. This is why we have $16 avocado toast. The New-American Northern California aesthetic doesn't always work out, but that's okay. It worked out here, for the benefit of San Francisco. But I digress...\n\nThe fresh mint chip, is the best mint chip by far. Yes, it takes a moment to re-adjust. We're like the animal in the chemical mint-chip cage, that when it sees the light, stays inside its fake-green weird preferences. But then, once you get past the crap-chocolate chip bars, and into the light where the fresh mint grows, you'll never want to go back. Would it be pretentious to say... it's refined? \n\nFriends of mine who are healthy and dairy-free swear by the dark chocolate sorbet. Yes, but in my own lactose-intolerant denial, I will go for a flight of everything dairy. Plus, a coffee with cream. The peanut butter fudge always ends up as one of the five. They're kind of small scoops. I go with people, I swear.

After sampling a couple of them, I opted to go with one of the more frequent offerings they rotate in - PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE FUDGE ($3.95, single scoop).\n\nAlthough it doesn't look nearly the same, I thought this tasted very similar to the version I used to get as a kid from Baskin-Robbins.  Even without the giant chunks of peanut butter (which I LOVED), this one was rich, had a nice balance of flavors, and didn't seem overly sweet or sugary.  As for the texture, I liked how it wasn't very icy and had a nice creaminess to it, though my friend thought hers could've been creamier.\n\nCompared to the likes of Bi-Rite, Humphrey Slocombe, or Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous, it'd be fair to say that Hometown Creamery falls just a bit short.

I prefer mint only in its leaf and gum form only, so I'll decline to rate this one. \n\n- Squash and strawberry flavor: Hmm, this was a regrettable flavor to choose. The savory squash paired with the naturally sweet strawberry flavor clashed like oil and water. \n\n- Madagascar vanilla: People say vanilla is boring.

Honestly, I think a lot of ice cream shops have pros that make them more appealing than others. So I'll focus on why this creamery is good.\n\nThey make their ice cream in small batches, so you can try new flavors pretty often. \n\nThey give you decent sized scoops.\n\nThey use compostable materials, so yay environment!\n\nThe flavors are tasty and they have very unique ones! The last one I tried was a special that they made and all the proceeds went to hurricane relief. I think it was called the big heart! And it was bourbon flavored with toffee and caramel(?) But it was yummy!\n\nMy favorite thing about this creamery though is that you can order a flight of ice cream. This is awesome when you come with friends and can't decide which flavor to get. Simple solution - try them all!\n\nThe location is also easy to get to, inner sunset, but parking can be a pain depending on day/time you go. I'll keep going back because it's yummy ice cream with options and conveniently located.", "author": "Melissa W."}

It's in a cute little building tucked away in the Inner Sunset District.  Once inside there are cute murals on the wall depicting the different districts in SF.  We were greeted by the inviting aroma of freshly baked waffle cones while in line. \n\nWhen I got to the counter I tried a few different flavors and finally settled on salted caramel ice cream in a waffle cone.  The flavor is subtle, not overly sweet, and delicious.   My wife got canteloupe sorbetto in a cup, which did not disappoint.  \n\nMy only suggestion would be to improve efficiency and get people through the line more quickly.   We had to wait for a very long time to get served, but it was definitely worth it.\n\nI also like their serving sizes.

Standing inside a creamery tricks your stomach into thinking there's always room for dessert. And this is exactly what happened to me when I visited SF's Hometown Creamery with a few friends.\n\nI was going to decline ice cream altogether when I saw that they offer something called a \"smidge\" which is a cup smaller than a small. Genius! There's always room for just a smidge of ice cream. I caved in when I made eye contact with the peanut butter and chocolate ice cream. One of my few ice cream weaknesses.\n\nThe staff members who worked here were super sweet (no pun intended) to all of us, especially as they were cleaning up and closing.

We came on a Friday evening sort of near closing time and the store was still bustling with couples, friends, and family! The environment is so peaceful and cozy and the service is extremely friendly. \n\nIce cream flavors rotate daily and also seasonally. I believe they keep some flavors always on their menu, such as Fresh Mint Chip. You can also ask for free waffle crumbles on the side or on top of the scoops. In addition, there is also free water in the back of the shop.\n\nFor the ice cream flight, you get to choose 5 flavors in 5 small shot glasses. Based on what was available, we decided to go with what sounded interesting and adventurous: French Roast Coffee, Apple Pie, Romeo e Julieta (queso fresco & guava jelly), Navajo's Squash Blossom (pumpkin butternut squash and prickly pear jelly), and Taysia's Thanksgiving Special (spiced sweet potato with marshmallow fluff).

And they have a pretty unique ice cream flight option. Price point is great, it's not as expensive as some of these other shops in SF. \n\nSo I came here with some friends and we got the ice cream flight to share. You get to pick five flavors. One scoop of each and a cup of crushed waffle cones. The waffle cone is pretty delicious, it isn't your typical waffle cone, it tasted like cookie butter! So the five flavors, ranked from my favorite to least, that we chose were the chocolate sorbet, mint chip, coconut sticky rice, matcha, and cream with apple. The chocolate sorbet was great, rich, thick, tasted like a brownie! The mint chip is really good too, I never liked mint chocolate chip ice cream because of that artificial mint flavor, but this was the real deal! As if I bit right into the mint leaf itself. This is probably their most unique/well-known flavor, and it's good! The coconut sticky rice was good, tasted like your typical coconut dessert. The matcha was as expected as matcha ice creams go, I would have liked a stronger green tea flavor, but that's just me. And the cream with apple was essentially vanilla ice cream with apple bits which was alright. But all this for $12 and a cute little flight, so worth!\n\nFive scoops might sound daunting, but I believe in you, you can do it!

It is in a convenient location for me and would have loved to love this place, but I just find it mediocre. \n\nI appreciate that the flavors are pretty unique and when I walk by, I'm always interested in what kind of flavors they have at the moment because they change up their flavors quite often. They do have a few classic flavors that they usually keep around as well. I think their flavors do sound interesting and appealing, but I hold to my opinion that this place isn't bad, but it isn't my go to place for ice cream. From what I have tried, I do think that their ice cream is more on the icy-er side and not as smooth and silky. This has been the case during more than one experience for me. It wasn't extremely prevalent in the ice cream but noticeable. \n\nAlthough I'm not a fanatic about this place, I do think that their ice cream flight is pretty great. I think that if you have never been here and would like to try a variety of different flavors or if you simply can't choose, the ice cream flight is definitely a must. It's a sampler of your choice of 5 flavors. If you come here, this is worth the try.

That's right, five scoops of ice cream served with waffle cone crumbles? I'M THERE. Finally got the chance last night to go. The ice cream man was like \"Your first time here and you're getting the flight? That's a ballsy move.\" That's how I do ice cream man, that's how I do.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n2/2 Stars for Taste -- I went with a friend and he chose mint chip and coconut. At first, I eyed him askance for the mint chip (because basic), but the minute I took my first bite, my eyes almost rolled up into my head. The taste of fresh mint exploded across my taste buds. None of that artificial mint extract over here, nope. YUM. The coconut was creamy and tasted exactly like you would expect it to taste. \n\nI chose the roasted black sesame with miso caramel, caipirinha, and fresh ginger. The roasted black sesame was SO good -- almost savory, but still decadently delicious. I didn't really taste the miso caramel though. The fresh ginger wasn't as strong as I thought it would be, but the light fresh taste of ginger was really refreshing. The caipirinha was like a punch in the face, but one you would welcome over and over again. As I puckered my lips and squinted one eye, I thought \"damn, that's good.\"\n\nThe ice cream melts a little quickly, but the flight is served in shot glasses so at the end, you can shoot the leftover liquid. No shame!\n\nOn top of all this, the waffle cone crumbles were delicious and tasted better than any free crumbles have the right to taste. The cone was thick, crunchy, and had a light cinnamon taste.\n\n1/1 Stars for Value -- It was about $13 (with tax) for the flight. To give you an idea of size, the five scoops were served in shot glasses. With the first taste, you know immediately that all the ice cream is made fresh with real ingredients. You are definitely getting what you pay for -- top notch ice cream with FREE waffle cone crumbles. \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service -- The first thing our server said to us was, \"Any flavors you want to taste?\" YES. That is what I like to hear at an ice cream store. After meticulously preparing our flight, he looked at the bucket of waffle cone crumbles, grabbed another cone, and crumbled it before our eyes to make sure we got nice big pieces. MY MAN (slow clap). \n\nAs we were eating, I also saw the owner (?) prepare a milkshake for another guest. He and the guest were discussing what ice cream flavors would make the best shake and in the end, I'm pretty sure they settled on a very complicated ratio of chocolate sorbet and mint chip ice cream. When he handed the guest the finished product, he said, \"Let me know how that tastes\". Let me tell you, every last worker here is an artist. \n\nBonus star because this place is dangerously close to school and I can see myself coming back for a scoop of any of those flavors that I tried last night. \n\nTL;DR: Fresh and delightfully delicious ice cream that comes in both interesting and basic flavors. Come for a scoop or a flight, topped off with free cinnamon waffle cone crumbles. YUM.", "author": "Abby W."}

The Sake Ginger Pear Sorbet was good; almost tasted like a mushed up sweet pear in liquid form. \n\nWe'll come back for the flight some other time but our first experience was a pretty good one given we got there at 9:50 pm and they close at 10 pm.", "author": "Olivia C."}

There were also real graham cheesecake bits mixed in. \n\nThe strawberry balsamic is always a good choice too!

This place can get a bit crowded and the staff here were a bit slow, so I think efficiency is something they could work on. The staff were friendly enough though and I was able to try the flavors to decide on the 5 I wanted to try for the flight.\n\nWe ended up getting basil (very herby), purple rain (pancakes and blueberry), peanut butter chocolate fudge, chocolate chip cookie dough, and fresh mint chip (super duper minty!). I like that the flight are shot-sized portions of ice cream so you can switch between flavors and can't get tired of one flavor. Although we did get the unique flavors, I still enjoyed the more typical peanut butter chocolate fudge and cookie dough ice cream.

Initially, I thought it was related to the San Francisco Creamery known for the kitchen sink but after looking at the flavors and the layout, I realized they are completely different. I was pleasantly surprised to see that all of their ice cream was made locally and they had over a dozen unique flavors. My friends and I decided to share a \"Flight\" with 6 different flavors. We went with: \n\n1. Cardamon- Very unique flavor which tasted alright. We just wanted to try it. Not something I'd order again but it's worth a try. \n\n2. Honey Lemon Rosemary- Very lemony flavor and you can taste each ingredient. The mix works well together. \n\n3. Salted Caramel- Maybe I've been spoiled by birite's salted caramel but the salted caramel here was not up to par. It was average at best. I felt like it tasted more syrupy than natural salted caramel. \n\n4. Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge- This flavor was pretty good. The thick peanut butter wasn't overpowered by the chocolate. It was extremely sweet however so its kind of difficult to eat an entire scoop on your own. \n\n5. Maple Pecan- This flavor was good but not amazing. Tasted just like what you would expect pecan to taste like but it didn't have any special touch to make it unique. \n\n6. Cookies and Cream- Again it was alright. I've had better at different locations. Pretty much vanilla ice cream with some Oreos in it. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, the service was great and the worker were very patient as we decided on the flavors to order. 5 stars there but I think the ice cream is below average. I felt like most of the flavors were comparable to Safeway brand. I think when I hear home made ice cream, I expect very creamy with chunks of fruit or nut depending on the flavor with their unique touch and interpretation. However, I felt like the ice cream here just tasted generic. I also felt the scoops are pretty small for what you pay. I really want to like this place and I'll probably go back to give them another chance but with Birite and Mitchell's everywhere, there's a lot of competition. 2 stars for the ice cream.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

The ice cream was delicious and very fresh tasting. The brownies were a different version of Rocky Road and it was great. The cone held up well and didn't leak at the bottom and was yummy.

There are so many wonderful creameries in San Francisco, but what made this place stand up to the rest is their super unique and rotating homemade flavors being served in a flight of ice cream. The ice cream has to be the most worth item getting because it's 5 flavors for $13 (you save 50 cents, not a huge difference I might add). Service was really great. The server neatly packs a generous serving of ice cream in your shot glasses. Also they provide tiny pieces of waffle cones as chips for dipping. The wait wasn't much of a wait at all, probably due to the fact that my friend and I came on a weeknight.\n\nI got the flight with chocolate sorbet, french roast coffee, parfronte?, strawberry, & lemon poppy seed.\n\nMy favorite flavors were the lemon poppy seed and chocolate sorbet. The lemon poppy seed was a nicely sweet and refreshing taste. The chocolate sorbet was rich in heavy dark chocolate.

Maybe the flavors were a little too subtle for me.

I found San Francisco's Hometown Creamery via someone's beautiful Snapchat, and dragged a good friend from the Haight here.\n\nThe line moves fairly quickly, but they're generous with their samples and you don't feel rushed. Paying $12 for a flight is absolutely worth it for the diverse range of flavors you get.

It came with a bowl of waffle cone crumbles, which I thought was a lovely touch. Note to other social media addicts: these flights are perfect for your next photo update on where you are now.\n\nI highly recommend all five of these flavors. The honey lemon is very strongly lemon, with a rosemary aftertaste. Fresh mint chip tastes EXACTLY like fresh mint, which made me giddy, while the chocolate sorbet was incredibly creamy and flavorful for something that I normally expect to be icy and a little disappointing. I wasn't much of a coffee person when I tried this place out, but it had a strong kick to it that my friend loved. Lastly, I'd honestly never heard of haroset, but I fell in love with the taste.

It was true - I was stuffed so I took his look as sign to just try samples for now. \n\nThey had a lot of the usual flavors : a chocolate, mint chip, peanut butter chocolate, coffee, coconut, cookies and cream. The unusual suspects were caipirinha, ginger, and black sesame. I tried the caipirinha sorbet - very light and refreshing but I was looking for something creamier. The coffee sample was good too but I ended up choosing the black sesame with miso caramel.  The single scoop came in what felt like a homemade waffle cone too. That cone really made it.

Don't get me wrong, I love ice cream as much as the next person, but besides their homemade waffle cones, I wasn't blown away by anything else much. \n\nThis ice cream place is located in a part of San Francisco where parking can be a total pain in the ass. There's a lot of restaurants and shops around the area so no wonder they decided to plant themselves here. It's fine, but as a driver who's not completely comfortable in San Francisco, this was a bit of a challenge. Eventually I found parking and my friends and I just had to walk a few blocks down to this place. \n\nThey keep a menu outside on the sidewalk to let you know which flavors they will be serving and you'll probably see it as the place with a line out the door. The workers try to work as fast as possible, but they do offer free samples so that does slow it down a bit. To be honest, I'm not sure what flavors I ended up getting. They have a sampler you can do that allows you to order 5 different flavors to try and that was around $10-12 I believe? It's pricey here. \n\nThere are tables and chairs to sit at and a bathroom as well. They keep water cups to the side, and it should be pretty noticeable.\n\nOverall, come back? Uh... Maybe?

Both were really good! I like how subtle the flavors are and how they aren't too overpowering in the taste buds. I've also had little licks of the Sufganiyot flavor (a Jewish jelly donut) which was actually pretty good! \n\nThis is a good spot for someone who likes to venture out from ordinary, plain, boring ice cream flavors and a cute date spot!

What's even better is that this ice cream shop is run by two brothers (even their mom helps create their unique flavors and tasty concoctions!) so everything tastes incredibly homemade (with love!) Too cheesy? But it's true! \n\nMy friends know that I am not a huge ice-cream fan, I mean I enjoy it, but when it comes to experimenting new flavors, I usually stick to what I am comfortable with (aka chocolate, coffee, or green tea). However, SFHC has so many ethnic inspired flavors that it's hard to not to deviate and try something different... i.e. - their \"Sufganiyot (Traditional Hanukkah Jelly Donut)\" flavor was something I had to try and it was incredible! I've never tasted anything like it. I ended up with a lemon + something else (not the peach lemon thyme sorbet), I'm bummed I can't remember the name!! But it was so good and I was pleasantly surprised that the lemon flavor didn't overpower the taste. I'm in love!!\n\nThe best surprise was when we found out that you could still get the smidge sized scoop in a CONE for FREE!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-20", "description": "SF's Hometown Creamy seems like it should belong in Palo Alto rather than SF. My reasoning:\n\n1) It's bouge. They one-up fancy-pants flavors with their sophisticated combinations and marketable flavor names, such as Earl Grey lavender (recommended, I got a scoop of this--creamy and good tea flavor) , cardamom with salted honey caramel (first time I've seen so many bouge flavors in combo!), and pumpkin spice (for basic PLS fans, of course). The ice cream flight is rather unique, but $11 is a hefty price, especially since the presentation isn't mind-blowing and won't guarantee huge numbers of Instagram likes.\n\n2) There is so much space!!! Many well-known SF ice cream places look like hole-in-the-walls with minimal seating, while SF Hometown Creamery has the space of a restaurant. That being said, it is one of the few ice cream places in SF that's good for groups. (Fun fact: it took over the space for what used to be a ramen place, hence the space and all the Japanese decor with the wooden touches and oriental style awnings)\n\n3) It's a tad bit pretentious. Prices are the standard SF $3.95/scoop, except that--to my discontent--you can only get one flavor for a single scoop :(( Also, the interior has a large display of text on the wall claiming to be \"the only creamery in SF to make small batch ice cream completely from scratch\". In my opinion, good ice cream places have ice cream speak for itself without the need for blasting bragging rights. And FYI, Shakedown in Tenderloin serves small batch artisanal ice cream made from the purest ingredients... so SF Hometown should erase the italicized \"only\"? I dislike pretentious advertising, and false advertising is an absolute contraindication!\n\nThe verdict: Not bad, but doesn't quite make the cut in the context of the fierce and icy SF ice cream competition. I prefer Holy Gelato in the area, Polly Ann's a little farther, or Easy Breezey when I pretend to be healthy in choosing froyo over ice cream.", "author": "Edna C."}

Instead, it's probably best if you took your ice cream to go and walked around Irving st/GG park rather than sitting down.\n\nWe ordered the 5 flavor ice cream combo.  Came in nice shot glasses and a display, so our cameras (and IG) ate first.  However, I guess my palate's not sophisticated enough to handle some of the more eccentric flavors.  I do admit they've got some bourgeois selections--spicy Mexican chocolate, cardamom, etc.  We went with cardamom (dates), kiwi, banana nut, mint, and vanilla.  Cardamom was...interesting; a sweet Middle-eastern flavor.  I love kiwi's but just couldn't take its almost bitter flavor.  Mint tasted EXACTLY like a mint leaf.  No, that's not a good thing, especially if you're expecting basic mint ice cream.  Banana nut was, well, nutty, and vanilla was vanilla (not a positive, since you're paying a premium for scoop of something you could get for a buck fifty anywhere else).\n\nI think the flavors are seasonal, but unless you want to experiment or test out random ice cream flavors, I'd try one of SF's many other creameries.", "author": "Matthew W."}

The lavender and tea are both potent and really work together. It does have a slightly grittier texture like red bean ice cream. I didn't mind it too much but of course it'd be even better if it was silky and smooth. The Dubliner was also delicious like a rich chocolate ice cream with an extra kick but I wanted something lighter so I went with the Pear Sorbet.

Both were delicious with the Tea Time being on the lighter side. I find that the Smidge is more than enough to satisfy any craving. It's deceptively larger than it seems on the display and is only $2.50. \n\nGreat, small-town ambiance with plenty of seating and space for small and large groups. Will definitely be a returning customer!", "author": "Arielle I."}

It is not the decadent, rich, and thick creaminess that Hometown's big competition like Bi-Rite or Mitchell's or Humphry have down to a science. Hometown has great flavor, but the the texture was disappointingly subpar. It was not smooth, but actually icy. And that's why it is 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.

Both of them are incredibly friendly and upbeat - you can tell they're passionate about their ice cream shop.\n\nAmbiance: Fun paintings are hung up on the walls of different SF neighborhoods. The shop itself is decent size with few tables and stools for sitting. It gives off a local family vibe with some cool oldies music playing in the background.\n\nFlavors: SUPER UNIQUE! I tried the Fresh Mint and the mint definitely tasted different and distinct from your usual mint ice cream. I was taken aback after I tried it for the first time. The ice cream was bursting with fresh mint leaf flavor - something that I haven't tasted from any mint ice cream I've had in the past. \n\nI love that everything (ice cream and waffle cones) is homemade. I read in the article from Hoodline that one of the brothers loves cooking and he constantly makes new ice cream flavors. He uses his traveling experience and what he's learned about different cultures to experiment and add a unique flavor to every ice cream he's created. \n\nAlso, there are more sherbets than I expected. The line of people waiting for ice cream was coming out of the door, but it went by fairly quickly. Since it's still new, they only have about 9 flavors. I look forward to more of their unique flavors in the future! I will come back for sure.", "author": "Kristal D."}

Cool neighborhood-themed art though they don't have anything for the Tenderloin (my nabe!) \n\nFlavors: Good selection and some interesting flavors but nothing new/exciting when compared to the other ice cream shoppes in town (Shakedown, Humphrey, Mr and Mrs, etc.). \n\nI tried the vanilla (meh, no depth), caramelized banana (good, I ended up going with this one), and the honey lime rosemary. The tasting was really little...I mean a tiny tiny bit on the tip of the spoon. Other places are much more generous with their samples which makes it easier to commit to a $4 scoop of ice cream.\n\nThe texture of the ice cream here was also too frozen/hard/icy. It may be an issue with the freezer but the consistency was really off-not creamy enough given that they make it in house. Maybe it's an issue with their ice cream base? Since they are new, I think working out the kinks in their ice cream texture would make things a lot better.\n\nI had the smidge size on their waffle cone. I thought the come was sort of bland and weirdly chewy. I probably will get a cup next time.\n\nGlad there's an ice cream place on this block since Holy Gelato isn't that great but the clothing store on the same block as this place also sells ice cream (Humphrey's?) that rivals this place.

The workers were also really nice and engaging. \n\nI was able to sample a few flavors: strawberry balsamic, peach lemon-thyme sorbet, fresh mint chip, chocolate sorbet, and blackberry sorbet.

Having made my own ice cream for years, I can tell you it was really disappointing to learn some other shops \"cheat\" in the way. Not SF Hometown, they make their own each day, super fresh. It also lets them change ratios of cream, sugar and egg to allow for a larger variety of flavors and textures.\n\nThe shop is actually quite large for the area it is in.

I love the innovation they bring by introducing flavors you don't typically find. It's all great, but I'm worried that it's the reason that many people are having hit or miss experiences. You really have to knock the execution out of the water if you want to successfully make ice cream from scratch and offer flavors that most people aren't familiar with. \n\nI ordered a double scoop of the Tea Time and Banana flavors, and while I did enjoy the ice cream overall, don't think it lived up to the hype of being this revolutionary place.

I've been meaning to write a review for this place especially since I've been here a thousand times.\n\nSo one day I was having dinner with a friend and we stumbled upon this ice cream shop on 9th & Irving and ever since that day, I've been hooked! It's owned by these two brothers who are always super cool and friendly when they talk to you. I haven't been seeing them much now that business is booming and they can afford to have more employees, but everyone there is super nice!\n\nI remember reading an article about how they're one of the first ice cream places to be specially licensed pasteurizers which means they can make fresh ice cream in-house. So cool!! This allows them to experiment and make as many ice cream flavors they want! Each time I go there, they always have something different to try. From Alfajores cookie ice cream to a grapefruit mimosa sorbet. Even their vanilla is amazing! Especially with their hot fudge...ugh schmackalackinnn. Even their chocolate chip cookies are to die for. Sometimes they have the chocolate chip cookie with not that many chocolate chips which is a rare treasure to me hahah. You can even buy a flight of ice cream if one flavor isn't enough for you. AND they make your waffle cone fresh off the iron! \n\nMan, just everything about this place is so great. I love it. Definitely come here as much as you can. It's the freakin greatesttttttt.", "author": "Melissa M."}

I was a big fan of Hotei, the noodle shop that was based in this space, so i was sorry to see it go. But i'm glad that a quality establishment like this has taken its place. \n\nIt's a responsible business and by report they source locally and make everything on premise without any artificial flavors. They even have a waffle iron where they make the cones, rolling them up on site!  That is important but would not count for much if the product were not high quality...but it definitely is great ice cream!\n\nThey Make a few classic basic flavors...i had the coconut and peanut butter/chocolate. The coconut was not to sweet but had chunks of real coconut so that was good. The peanut butter abs chocolate was different from what you might expect at Baskin and Robbins, the peanut taste was blended...rich but not overwhelming.\n\nMy wife did very well with the carrot cake (amazingly close to the real thing) and the baklava, which was hands down the best offering.\n\nDefinitely a place to visit!", "author": "Alan S."}

First, the interior of the business is very unique. A great mix of simplicity with cozy atmosphere. The smell of fresh brewed coffee and waffle cones entices anyone that walks by. There are plenty of seats and customer service was friendly.\n\nNow to the ice cream! I hate to be a critical reviewer here but SF has some amazing creameries and Hometown has some tough competition. Hometown's ice cream had some great flavors that were very strong. This was a big positive! But the one area that I cannot forgive was the iciness of the ice cream. The consistency of my scoop tasted like a milky gelato. It may have been a bad batch or just their style but my experience did not move me to rate Hometown with a 4 or 5 star which should be reserved for the top creameries in the city.\n\nI will give it another shot and hopefully update my review!", "author": "Eric K."}

Even when I roll out of a restaurant completely full from dinner, if I spot an ice cream parlor, I HAVE to have it. A second stomach somehow emerges as I rummage for a lactaid pill in my purse.\n\nHometown Creamery is known for their ice cream flight - 5 flavors of your choice in cute little shot glasses for $12. I was tempted to get this, but I didn't find enough flavors that tickled my tastebuds. They also have smidge sizes, which are perfect for kids or if you're not that hungry. \n\nI must have gone on an off night the other day because most of the flavors were unoriginal and mildly flavored. They had your run-of-the-mill chocolate, vanilla, mint, and coffee flavors, but even the more \"inventive\" ones were peanut butter fudge, rocky road, and a kiwi sorbet. I settled on peanut butter fudge and coffee and while they were good, the ice cream lacked a creamy dense texture and the cones leaked really easily. Service was average - the type where you have to say hi first and samples seem like a burden. \n\nI loved the ambiance though. Glass windows adorned with icicle lights and artwork on the back wall featuring multiple San Francisco neighborhoods. Good amounts of bar stool and table seating. Any ice cream shop is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood, but I didn't have the wow factor that I was hoping for. Hometown doesn't claim to be like a Bi-Rite or Humphrey Slocombe, but even against Mitchell's, Fenton's, and Swensen's, it was just okay.  I'd be willing to come back if I'm in the neighborhood, but definitely not a destination spot.", "author": "Deanna Y."}

The flavors are inventive, but the execution is not there. I tried the peanut butter chocolate chip, earl gray/lavendar, and fresh mint chip. The place touts the fact that they are the only creamery to do EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH, but whoopdeedoo, it isn't really that tasty. The texture was pretty light and the flavors were not concentrated enough for my palate. Granted, I make my own ice cream, which many have asked me to start selling, so yes, I am a bit of an ice cream snob.\n\nI didn't love the peanut butter chocolate chip and the earl gray/lavendar was light on the earl gray and heavier on the lavendar, but not intense enough for my tastes at all. I usually know I don't like \"fresh mint chip\" ice creams because often people use spearmint, which makes the ice cream taste like toothpaste. There is a HUGE difference between spearmint and peppermint - peppermint is your candy cane and your \"normal\" mint flavor. Spearmint is toothpaste and gum. Gross. I am a peppermint mint fan all the way and mint ice cream should never be anything else. So, I was curious to see whether they could make a good fresh mint chip and my curiosity has been sated - the answer is NO.\n\nThe worst part of this was that I definitely felt obliged to buy and didn't want to hold up tasting more flavors and finding more flavors I was disappointed in, so I went ahead and got the smallest option there was, a \"smidge\" that cost $2.50. In a way it worked out, since I didn't want that much, but it also made me think that this was so typically SF. A smidge is literally maybe 2 tablespoons of ice cream...I brought my smidge back and my friend said, \"Is that a sample?\" And I said, \"LOLOLOLOLOLO NO. I paid $2.50 for this\".\n\nThe bright side is that unlike other gourmet ice creameries in the city, this place actually has seating.

Even the cookies and the waffle cones! I've tried their other flavors, but I'm not a huge fan of fruity ice cream flavors so I always go back to the fresh mint chip. Their peanut butter fudge is also really good -- super creamy, chocolate-y and VERY peanut buttery. Their waffle cones are also incredible. I'll admit, I'm usually the type of person that usually gets ice cream, devours the ice cream and tosses the cone. I'm just not really into cones because they're usually too crunchy and hurts my mouth. But wow, these cones.

Not too crunchy, but definitely not soft, you just gotta try one to get what I mean. They're addicting. \n\nThe shop itself is very cute. It's pretty large for an ice cream shop.

First bite, the texture of crispy outside and chewy center was on point. First taste, the \"classic\" chocolate chip flavor just wasn't there!

The Fresh Mint Chip had a nice flavor to it. It was clean and fresh with a good amount of broken chocolate chips. The consistency of it wasn't as smooth and creamy as other places like Mrs. & Mrs. Miscellaneous and Bi-Rite Creamery. The Chocolate Sorbet was rich, but it was a bit bitter and chalky. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love dark chocolate.. even 85%, but this one tasted much more bitter on the palate. As far as the consistency, I'm not sure if it was from bittersweet or semisweet cocoa powder or if it was from the sorbet base.

We were going to go to Holly Gelato but surprisingly we found parking right across the street from here and thought we'd try it out. From the outside I honestly thought it was going to be some type of Japanese dessert place given the outside architecture but it's a little ice cream shot that likely used to be a Japanese restaurant. I think they just decided to roll with the interior and made it work instead of remodeling and it works well!! Along with the neighborhood art on the walls. But anyways they let you order a FLIGHT of ice cream which is great because then you get to try all their great flavor!! Great to share between two people. \n\nE for Exceeds Expectations \n\nWe got going from the left\n1) Caffe Mocha - this was really strong. Like a straight up espresso with all the strong caffeine taste. They also balance that out with a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Recommended for coffee lovers\n2) Tea time on the Thames - this was super interesting. Blend of lavender and earl grey which go together very well. When you first taste it, you get a blast of lavender, like sticking your face in a lavender field blast and once that sits in and the ice cream begins to settle in your mouth BOOM in comes the Earl Grey. Surprising blend of tastes.\n3) Rocky road to happiness - I'm not a big fan of rocky road but my friend got this and she liked it. Mainly chocolate though, not much marshmellow but definitely some addition of almonds\n4) fresh mint chip - wow!!! Just wow!!!! Usually when I get mint chocolate ice cream, I enjoy that menthol taste you get with things like Andes chocolate and spearmint gum, but THIS. This was a refreshing taste of mint leaves in you mouth!!! It's like they actually took mint leaves and ground it into the ice cream. Still, only my second favorite in the 5\n5) peanut butter chocolate fudge - I love peanut butter and therefore this is my favorite. This tasted like a Reese's pieces except with more peanut butter!!! I was a very happy child at the end.\n\nCan't wait to come back here and try new flavors!!!!", "author": "Tatiana T."}

They had like a maximum of 6-8 flavors when I went and I got to sample all of it. The guy who helped me gave me very little ice cream on the spoon and I barely tasted anything, but I didn't want to be a nuisance. I decided to get two scoops with the price of $4.50, one flavor was peanut butter chocolate fudge and the other was sea salted caramel. I think it's expensive here. Apparently they make the ice cream from scratch on the same day so maybe that's why? \n\nI actually really enjoyed the ice cream from here. Very creamy and smooth! The caramel didn't have too much of a strong caramel taste, kind of tasted like a twix. The pb chocolate fudge tasted like reese's and had a more powerful peanut butter flavor. \n\nYou can't buy happiness but you can buy ice cream, which is almost the same thing.

The scoops are smaller than the picture depicts, but it's still a good amount of ice cream. You also get waffle cone pieces to go with the flight, and the ones we got we a bit stale, but still yummy nonetheless. The flavors are definitely unique, you'll get some you really like, and you'll get some you never want to have again. You can obviously try the ice cream before you choose which ones go in the flight, but I always feel bad for trying too many flavors. I'm assuming they rotate their flavors often because I haven't even heard of some of the flavors listed in the other reviews. My boyfriend got a pecan bar there and said it was absolutely divine, so check that out!

I was overwhelmed with what to get because I can never just choose ONE flavor....like do I pick a basic one or should I go with a more unique one that other places wouldn't have??

This is my absolute favorite flavor in the world (or at least right now).  It just didn't have enough different sizes pieces of cookies and the ice cream flavor, just not the best. \nPluot sorbet - this is one of the best flavors from what we got. It was definitely softer than the other ones but that's a sorbet. Great pluot flavor. In case of those you who don't know what a pluot is, it's like a mix between plum and apricot. \nBaklava - also good. I loved the small pieces of pastry running through the ice cream and honey like taste throughout. Yum! \nMatcha - this was good but not amazing. Tasted like any other matcha flavor. Good and creamy which I definitely look for in an ice cream. \nPeanut butter chocolate fudge - probably our favorite flavor of the night because it was just so good. The chocolate was really pronounced but always the peanut butter. It was like Reese's peanut butter cup in ice cream form.

I think this is great to order because you don't have to commit to just one flavor...YOU CAN CHOOSE 5. It's enough for 2-3 or so people depending on how much ice cream you can eat. We tried the caramelized roasted banana, Madagascar vanilla, fresh mint chip, strawberry balsamic, and matcha green tea! Everything from cones to ice cream is made from scratch in store and you can taste the freshness. Especially the fresh mint chip, it's NOT your average mint chocolate chip. It tastes like you're actually chewing on fresh mint leaves. Surprisingly this was my favorite, tied with the caramelized roasted banana. I feel like normally with banana flavored anything, the banana flavor gets lost, but it was really strong here!

Located on 9th avenue just past the N-Judah stop, this Creamery is hard to miss with its vintage looking sign and inviting outside board listing all their daily flavors!\n\nInside it is clean and large with plenty of seating and lots of decor. The wooden interior with the friendly servers and close seating makes it just the more warm, inviting, and homey! There is also a large board next to their super clean restrooms that display very clearly the prices, sizes and flavors.\n\nBesides the atmosphere, what's also great about this store is that they offer \"smidgen\" sizes and a flight of different flavors in that size if you can't decide and just want a few bites of some for cheap! I ended up getting a small scoop of their aztec chocolate with a hint of smoky cayenne in the aftertaste, which was divine! \n\nOverall, I loved the decor, the service, price, and most of all, the unique and not overly sweet flavors! :)", "author": "Kyrie S."}

There was no one waiting behind me when I went to try so the staff was nice enough to let me sample all the flavors but chocolate sorbet because I'm not a fan of chocolate ice cream or sorbet. The flavors I got were tasty! My favorite was the peanut butter :) the other flavors I tried were okay, and the texture was a little icier than most places. The texture of the ice cream threw me off a little.

I got a smidge size cone. It was generous for the price. I wonder if it was just me or if the ice cream was a bit icy instead of as creamy as i would expect. Fresh mint had amazing mint scent but i would choose a chocolate that holds up better frozen so it is less chalky.  Strawberry balsamic was good flavor too. \nI want them to stay open so I hope they are able to charge more if they need to. Rent cant be cheap and you need to sell a lot of ice cream.

With each bite you could really taste their designated flavors. The pineapple champagne really was sweet and felt like we were in Hawaii and the mint chip tasted like the actual leaf and the peanut butter chocolate really tasted like peanut butter. Vanilla Madagascar was pretty okay. It was overshadowed by all the other flavors though. \n\nThe two Guys working were very friendly. Always asked where we were from and where we had just come from and really made conversation. They make the icecream on site as well.

Well there's no doubt they have delicious homemade ice cream. Strawberry Balsamic was a definite stand out as it went perfectly with our so-called summer season as it was fresh. The balsamic vinegar gave it a balanced flavor without overpowering the strawberry. Another personal favorite was the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough but purely for their delicious cookie dough. Other flavors I tried were the French Roast Coffee Ice Cream (which my friend thought was a little strong and somewhat comparable to Humphry's Blue Bottle flavor), the Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge (another personal favorite since I'm obsessed with peanut butter), Meyer Lemon Poppy Seed (which took me by surprised to not be so sour), and Fresh Mint Chip (which was Hometown's personal favorite). \n\nNow you might think \"how can I simply just settle for just 1,2 or even 3 flavors of ice cream without any judgement!\" Luckily for you, they have their Ice Cream Flight which allows you to try up to 5 flavors of ice cream for only $12!

Apparently nobody else in San Francisco can make that claim -- not even my beloved Bi-Rite! I came in during their second week in business, and I was hugely impressed by Saadi's passion for ice cream, and his belief in making his own base -- which allows him to actually create different levels of creaminess and richness for different flavors. That's what every ice cream store SHOULD do, but hardly anyone does it!\n\nThat said, the flavor I had -- mocha almond chip -- was just ok. Good flavor intensity but not creamy enough, and a little icy. The vanilla and mint chip I tried weren't any better.\n\nBut I have faith! These folks are committed.

You will not find a richer tasting chocolate sorbet anywhere. The fresh mint chip was out of this world. You'd be hard pressed to find mint that fresh anywhere except perhaps a top drawer mojito for top dollar. The peanut butter chocolate was to die for. I could go on...\n\nThere's something for everyone from rich ice cream to equally rich, non-dairy sorbet, and just a \"smidge,\" single, double, triple cones or flights of 5 flavors. We even watched them make their waffle cones from scratch, one at a time, behind the counter. You can't get anything fresher or tastier than that. Period. These conscientious, hard-working guys have totally raised the bar.\n\nThe main point: This charming Creamery offers the freshest, highest quality, creative-genius flavor combinations anywhere--e.g., peach-lemon-thyme, strawberry-balsamic, and honey-lemon-rosemary (yummy!), and traditional flavors that are in a class of their own too. Seriously! I can hardly wait to try their new flavors as they're rolled out over time.

Has a rough texture I think.  Quite chocolaty and satisfied my craving alright.  \n\nThe line is almost out the door for this place but it moves at a decent speed.  Prices are ok, starting at $2.50 for a \"smidge\" or little scoop.  I like the ice cream flavors but the texture is pretty standard.  I wish they had a few more creamy flavors to choose from but they have a lot of sorbet to choose from, including chocolate, so if you are avoiding dairy this is a good place.", "author": "Audrey D."}

I tried the ginger, vanilla, tea thyme and some sort of kiwi flavor. The sugar in all of these overpowered the flavors they were trying to get at. And the flavors themselves were not pleasing to the palate--I felt like someone punched my tongue with a nasty blend off too much sugar and zing. Sometimes, sugar is added and not blended well...and here, it tastes like that for all of the ice cream. Probably the downside of being the only place to make small batches on the premises.\n\nThe cones that the cute guy behind the counter handled so cafefully though (like they were precious gems)...they are absolutely amazing. I would buy a ten pack of these cones if they offered them. \n\nCome for the cone!!!!

The inner sunset crowd is not the same crowd you will find in Dolores Park, Hayes Valley, Fillmore, etc. Inner Sunset folks are quieter, more reserved, and more family oriented. They will balk at a $6.50 root beer float. Six dollars and fifty cents?! Are you kidding me? Are they grinding organic sassafras in the back room and using San Pellegrino?\n\nOverall this place is solid but there's a Three Twins Ice Cream place just 25ft down the street that has really good ice cream as well.", "author": "Kevin W."}

We came on a Friday and waited about 10-15 min, tried the mint but went for the tiramisu on a cone instead.  Friendly service and like other yelpers mentioned scooper and cashier did switch jobs frequently.  No gloves on the ice cream scooper and hand washing I was not able to see (but it could have been done not sure).  Small work station for them and they have to turn around constantly to get the ice cream scoop in water.  \n\nPrice and size a little steep but I'm okay with that for now since I don't want to hike across town for other ice cream.  Hopefully in time they'll expand the counter area and improve the sink area/work station/ service issues.  I did really enjoy the ice cream and cone! I did see leakage issues from the melting ice cream dripping - they can fix this - add a mini marshmallow to block the bottom.  :) \n\nGlad to have this business in the Sunset!", "author": "Julie F."}

Was quickly disappointed. Waited in line with my boyfriend for a few minutes behind a couple ordering in front of us-not a big deal, not an impatient person. But when I did eventually get up to the ice cream display, the girl standing there was so incredibly awkward. After waiting a bit, the least I could've expected was a simple \"hi how are you?\", as this is a common thing to ask to your paying customers. Instead, she barely made eye contact with me and mumbled a \"hi\". Didn't ask if I wanted to try anything or if I knew what I wanted. There was also another guy working there but he was all over the place, on his phone and showing some customers something on his phone, never paying attention to any of the other guests in there.\nAnyway, I got two scoops (fresh mint chip and the 210) in a waffle cone. The scoops were pretty big for the large price I was paying so that was sweet. Once I tasted the ice cream though, it wasn't as sweet. The top scoop of my cone was mint chip and while it was indeed fresh tasting, it was grainy and icy and not smooth at all. Same thing for the 210. I was super disappointed. Had the ice cream actually had the consistency of ice cream, it would've been pretty tasty. Overall a disappointing experience, definitely didn't get the hype over this place :/", "author": "Kaeli A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-07", "description": "My FAVORITE San Francisco ice creamery! Below is a rundown of how Hometown Creamery compares to other SF ice creameries, ranked in order of my preference (accompanied by a half-serious, slightly comical, stereotyped personification of each store)\n\n***Hometown Creamery***\n\"The old-fashioned, pure and true family man\"\nAs true to flavor as one can be! It's as if they distilled the flavors down into their essences. Mint ice cream is minty-er than a mint leaf (trust me I've eaten these) and I don't think I will ever find an equal. Chocolate sorbet is far from your typical sorbet - extremely rich and decadent with almost a hint of soy. Salted caramel is delicious. Creamy and oily, but not overly so like Humphry Slocombe. Not nearly as sweet as Bi-Rite and Humphry but equally delicious due to the strong flavors (thus avoiding the brainfog that follows sugar overload). Stays cold and solid much longer than Bi-Rite but not as long as Smitten. Waffle cones are also delicious and smell great as you walk past. Lots of seating, but can still get crowded on weeknights/ends. Protip: their maple pecan bars, though not the main attraction, are actually quite delicious too!\n\nSmitten\n\"The engineer with a fancy pipe-dream turned reality\"\nExpensive but great quality. A small is two scoops with a baby spoon which gives the illusion of generous quantity. Just the right combination of creaminess (creamy without being oily like Humphry Slocombe or overly filling like Bi-Rite) and sweetness (sweeter than Hometown but not as sweet as Bi-Rite). Doesn't melt too fast. Chunks are larger than Hometown (Hometown doesn't really have any chunks to be honest) but smaller than Bi-Rite's. They are very generous with their toppings, so get them if you are in the mood - it's worth it! Note that there is no option to sample flavors because they make to order, but you really can't go wrong. Cute, clean and brightly lit locations with some sitting and lots of standing room. A great way to try it for free is to download the Thanx app - you'll get a free small ice cream! https://signup.thanx.com/smittenicecream/Ellen-71691555\n\nTwirl n'Dip\n\"The happy-go-lucky toddler\"\nDefinitely overpriced given that it is simply soft-serve dipped in chocolate and served out of a food truck, and yet still somehow worth it... because how else in the world is one supposed to obtain chocolate shell-coated soft serve?! Not to mention it is right next to Cal Academy of Sciences & DeYoung Museums too with a nice outdoors patch of grass to eat it on. Adding sprinkles is pricey but worth it if you are trying to make your ice cream look photogenic. Strangely enough, would come here again despite the high price. But not too often.\n\nBi-Rite\n\"The popular teenage girl who makes fashion look fashionable\"\nSlightly overhyped: the flavors are solid but nothing special to warrant such long lines, and the ice cream melts fast which is disappointing for such a well-known creamery. Bi-Rite does get to claim a good location, though, as it is near Dolores Park. Minimal seating in store. Their ice cream is very sweet, creamy, dense and filling (a bit too much for me). Flavor options include the reliable classics, with generous chunks in many of the options (carrot cake had entire cubes of cake!). Love the fact that you can get a cone for no extra charge and the same amount of ice cream.\n\nHoly Gelato! (right down the street from Hometown Creamery)\n\"The pretend-foreign cousin who is actually American\"\nGood flavor selection, but does not meet my high standards for gelato (nothing really beats the real deal in Italy). Friendly service, but unimpressive ambiance.\n\nHumphry Slocombe\n\"The adventurous chemist\"\nHave tried their ice cream, but not in-store. Creative flavors but way too sweet and creamy for me - even richer than Bi-Rite. My lips and fingers were coated in oil afterwards... Good for the novelty but would not try again.\n\nStill need to try: Mitchell's, Salt&Straw, Souvla (they serve greek yogurt, not ice cream, but that sort of counts right?)", "author": "Ellen T."}

I'm currently on a Humphry Slocombe peanut butter fudge swirl addiction, so when I saw Hometown's peanut fudge flavor I just had to get it. Their peanut butter fudge is heavier on the fudge aspect. It reminds me of having a peanut butter cup. The fudge is really sharp, almost to the point of being too much yet the peanut butter balances it out. I still prefer Humphry Slocombe's peanut butter flavor. I also tried the baklava flavor. I'm a huge baklava fan and was surprised that I've never seen baklava ice cream. There is a fair amount of nuts, filo, and cinnamon. The only thing missing for me was a stronger flavor of honey. Maybe they could swirl in some actual honey to add a more prominent flavor? It'd look pretty too.", "author": "Michael H."}

Fresh, high quality ingredients really come through in their irresistible ice cream; made from scratch!  It was hard deciding, since I loved the Strawberry Balsamic, Ginger, (Oh so!) Fresh Mint Chip and Aztec Chocolate; the first three my favorites.  Oh My!  The Fresh Mint Chip tasted like eating mint from the garden, other mint ice creams can't compare.... at all.  The Ginger was also fresh and sweet, a new favorite!  Balsamic Strawberry takes fresh strawberry and kicks it up a notch..or two!  The Aztec Chocolate was rich, spicy and had a bit of cinnamon.  Two scoops for me and two for my mom, on their amazing homemade cinnamon waffle cones..mmmm.  Luckily, we got all of the above between the two of us! We shared!   Sharing is caring.  This creamery also makes their own base, not the case with other S.F. creameries.  \nThe owner/people who work there could not have been nicer or more patient as I sampled almost all their flavors.

No need to pick just one, there is an option to choose the flight deck which is where you get to choose 5 different flavors of ice cream that they make freshly each and every day!

All of these ice cream flavors kept the integrity of each ingredient as well elevating the flavor. The roasted sesame ice cream was rich, creamy, and the sesame flavor wasn't hidden. Now if your a peanut butter lover like me, then you HAVE TO TRY THEIR PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM! It's basically the equivalent to Reese cup ice cream but it's creamy, smooth, and it's not overly sweet. Visually it's really nice looking too! Instagram and snapchat worthy!

My boyfriend had gotten the Cafe Mocha, and he was delighted as well. Granted, it's a tad bit pricey (around $8 for two single scoop cones), but the taste was well worth it!

Stands up well to BiRite, etc.  \n\nRefreshingly different texture than the usual suspects in SF.  I was on the fence about the texture the first visit since I'm usually a fan of really dense ice creams, but it's really grown on me.  And the freshly made waffle cones included in the price of a scoop hit the spot.\n\nOwners are really friendly and the space is great for kids.  It still has the bones of the Hotei space, so perhaps they should embrace it and offer Asian flavors and toppings as well.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

The two charming brothers who own the store welcome you in and chat you up, demonstrating their obvious passion for flavor creation and community alike. \nThe ice cream flavors are exquisitely crafted. I've brought many friends to the Creamery, and the most common comment is \"whoa, that really *tastes* like what it's supposed to taste like.\" The brothers experiment with some delicate flavors, and they always come through as clear as if you were eating the original food. Some of my favorites have been Lemon Speculoos, and their...maybe it was Honey with Bourbon.\nThe space is a lot of fun: great decour, spacious, clean seating, paintings of the SF neighborhoods, and a map with pins that you can add to if your own hometown isn't represented yet. In the back is a wall of spices in Mason jars that the brothers will occasionally grab to show when describing a flavor, and a window to where the ice cream is made.\nThe cones are thick and crunchy, made right there in front of you-- you can smell them all the way down the street. Cones are free in both the regular size and the \"smidge\" size, as are extra cone pieces on top of your ice cream.\nOne of the best desserts I've ever had was when they brought out a freshly baked tray of cookies and created an ice cream sandwich for my friend and me -- they even split it meticulously down the center for us.\nAdditional mentions: home-spiced cider, water station, and restroom.\nThis place deserves five stars for making me feel welcome, delighting me repeatedly with new and inventive flavors, and keeping it personal.\nI originally wrote in this review about a month ago that my two points of criticism were that the line was confusing and the texture of the sorbets was a little off, but since then they have revisited the sorbet technique and are now creating an exquisite, creamy texture with even more flavor than the ice creams. Tonight a friend and I enjoyed Blood Orange sorbet paired with their rich chocolate sorbet. \n I love being a regular there--they certainly keep me coming back.", "author": "Allxie C."}

We were not able to purchase or sample any of their products because it was very crowded. People were crowding around the cashier and the ice cream. Although the freshly made cones smelled delicious, I and a few others decided not to figure out the queue and walked out.\n\nWanting to really offer our patronage, I decided to visit on a Wednesday evening when it wasn't as busy. I was able to sample a few flavors, but the sample the gentlemen was scooping for me was not enough to really get a sense of the taste. It was literally just a thin sheet. I also noticed there were a lot of options for gelato mixed in with ice cream. It would have been nice to see the gelato and ice creams arranged together so it will be easier to distinguish what is what. After sampling a few ice cream flavors, none really hit home to me so I went for the safety flavor, Vanilla. So I ended up getting a single scoop of the Madagascar Vanilla and it was a huge disappointment. It was not creamy, but hard, icy, and grainy. \n\nThere might be some growing pains the brothers might be figuring out. The layout and flow from selecting and paying for the product was confusing when it was crowded. The sample sizes were pathetic and for a \"creamery\"... might as well grab a pint of Ben and Jerry's from your local freezer section.\n\nMaybe there are some kinks the brothers need to work out, but I'm willing to try it again in a few months.", "author": "country g."}

The flavors are not that crazy-sounding, but I left wishing I had tried all of them.\n\nI got the Fresh Mint Chocolate Chip in a waffle cone. Its taste was both completely unexpected and exactly what it sounds like. The scoop was bursting with the flavor of fresh mint leaves! It was not your supermarket Mint Chocolate Chip. And the waffle cone was delicious, but maybe a bit too sweet. It tasted like a large, crispy cookie.

You can get much bigger scoops and a waffle cone from Mitchell's across town. But hey, it's across town.\n2) For a place that says creamery, it's actually more sorbet or gelato.\n3) There's only one person serving the ice cream while another runs cash register causing a really long unnecessary line especially if a new customer wants to try some samples. What they should be doing is having both guys taking orders and serving the ice cream while the 3rd guy in the back doing stock should have been in the front running the register. Speaking of serving customers....\n4) TOTALLY UNSANITARY SERVING CONDITIONS!!!!!! The person serving the ice cream,which included mostly waffle cones, did so with his BARE HANDS!!!! Now if you think I'm over reacting then take into account during the 10 minutes I was waiting in line, I saw the server wipe the his hands onto the side of shirt and towards the back of his pants. Every now and then he'd stick his thumbs into his pockets! What made things loud and clear that these people have not worked in the food industry at all was that the same server scratched the back of his head and later wiped the sweat of his forehead with his BARE HANDS! To top it off, when the cashier and server switched roles, at no time did I see the new server wash his hands after handling the cash and coins from how many customer which is a HUGE HEALTH CODE VIOLATION!!!!!!\nThese guys need to be wearing gloves when handling food.\nTheir hands should not be touching any part of their person or clothing.\nAnyone handling food needs to thoroughly WASH THEIR HANDS WITH SOAP before preparing and serving food!\n5) They should change the name of their Mint Chocolate ice cream to Moquito, be cause it really does taste like I'm having a Moquito than a mint chocolate.\n6) They also really need more than 8 flavors (actually 7 flavors today since they sold out of peanut butter chocolate).

The shop has a very homey and casual ambience with tables and chairs for customers to chat and enjoy the ice cream, which I liked. However, the ice cream flavors and textures could be improved. San Francisco has many good ice cream shops, and the flavors here just do not compare with others in terms of how unique they are. The textures also did not impress; for the cost of a scoop, I expected much creamier ice cream, with attention to the smoothness and feel of a spoonful. The texture was mediocre, and the thing that keeps me coming back to an ice cream shop is not only the flavors, but most importantly the textures. The only thing that seemed impressive to me was that each flavor actually tasted like the name and not a sugary overdone rendition.

The service is very slow due to the checkout setup but the employees are nice.", "author": "Lissette L."}

Short line, and we were at the counter. We had initially made up our mind to get the end of summer s'mores and the peanut butter fudge, but were blown away by the mint chip when we tasted it. It had such a fresh mint flavor that wasn't overwhelming (think very fresh mohito without the alcohol). We ending up going with the peanut butter fudge and the mint chip in their freshly made waffle cones. We agree with other reviewers' assessment that the ice cream isn't as \"creamy\" as other SF favorites (ie BiRite), but we highly enjoyed the flavors and the location-- just down the street-- means we will certainly be back. We hope they continue to stay in business and plan to support them as they improve their method.", "author": "T K."}

I had it with a freshly made waffle cone, WOW! I believe this is the best home made ice cream I have ever had. The staff was very friendly and the shop was extremely clean; it was accommodating for enjoying inside the store. I will definitely return.", "author": "Elizabeth W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-18", "description": "It's great that the ice cream is made in shop, but the flavors aren't that good and there's nothing that really separates themselves from other ice cream shops. There's no edge they have against the competition except they are new and of course people want to try new stuff. My advice to the shop is make flavors that are unique and taste good. Check out Holy Gelato if you want ice cream that's made at the shop and they have unique flavors that taste good. Prices here are also more than the competition.", "author": "Mike W."}

Can't say enough good things about this place.  The vibe is very SF.  You are greeted with great music and a very friendly staff.  An amazing choice of ice creams it's available.  I had an ice cream sandwich with Snickerdoodle cookies and caramelized banana ice cream.  Delicious.  The rest of my family had root beer floats and they were all delighted.", "author": "Kyle S."}

And I feel even better about it knowing everything is made on premises with local ingredients. I've tried most of the flavors and they're all good. Cinnamon, peanut butter fudge and Aztec chocolate are my favorites so far. I really liked the Newsomes too but they have gone away for some reason :( The place is spacious and attractive, the guys who work there are friendly and efficient.

Went with the family for an after-lunch treat and was impressed with every part of the experience. Lovely space with lots of clean seating (no sticky table tops here), friendly and patient staff (it took us a while to decide), and amazing ice cream and treats. Everythig here is made on site; the ice cream, the cookies, the waffle cones....yum! The chocolate sorbet, the madagascar vanilla ice cream, the aztec chocolate ice cream and a chocolate chocolate chip cookie were tried and everyone raved about their choices. Will definitely be coming back!", "author": "J M."}

Anyone who knows me, knows that I am an ice cream connoisseur. Well, this spot, was sub par. Expensive, small portions, and a very limited selection of flavors. I mean this place has ample room many more displays of flavors. The taste was almost too creamy, buttery, leaving a film on the roof of my mouth that didn't subside for over an hour. Maybe it needs some time, as all new businesses so. While they are working on getting it right, I'll be in Cole Valley at The Ice Cream Shop!", "author": "Missy S."}

The highlight here is the positivity of the owners and the general vibe inside.   Just oozes joy from the moment you walk in.  Ice Cream could be a bit creamier and the cones a bit more like Ice Cream bar.  Sad to see Hotei go, but happy to stop in here for a happy fix.  I hope they make it!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-06", "description": "This ice cream is incredibly delicious! We sampled every flavor and ALL were great, but our two stand-out favorites, Fresh Mint Chip and Honey Lemon Rosemary, were superb! I have never tasted ice cream with such fresh, pure flavor. I would describe the flavors as strong, but perfectly balanced and not at all over-powering. One bite, and I could tell the home-made difference. Clearly, a lot of thoughtfulness goes into the recipes and ingredient selection here. Along with the warm, inviting smiles of the owners, groovy music and awesome decor (hand-painted panels representing SF neighborhoods painted by one of the owners), this place is FUN! On the day we visited, 9 awesome flavors were offered, which is plenty to select from. The place is immaculately clean, and there's plenty of room to hang out. Not surprised at all to see them recognized recently as one of the BEST ice cream shops in the Bay Area (http://redtri.com/san-francisco/the-best-ice-cream-in-the-bay-area/)!", "author": "Amy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-08", "description": "Walked in on a Saturday night after dinner.  We were drawn in by the welcoming smell of the warm waffle cones and decided to try it out.  Each of us asked for a taste.  The lady who was serving us gave us such a small taste that we hardly tasted the sample at all.  If you are going to give a sample, then commit.  I think the small dollop of ice cream on a front of the small tasting spoon cannot give you a \"true\" taste of what the ice cream tastes like.  None of us ordered what each of us sampled, e.g. banana, strawberry balsamic and chocolate sorbetto. Instead we went with the vanilla, mint chip and coconut.  Flavors were light and enjoyable.  The \"smidge\" size is fairly small and at $2.95, seems pretty steep (although the fresh waffle cone should count for something - but the cup and cone are the same price).  If craving ice cream and I'm in the neighborhood, I would stop by but I can't say I would make a special trip to go there.", "author": "Will L."}
