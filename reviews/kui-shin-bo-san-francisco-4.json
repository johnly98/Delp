I'm really glad Kui Shin Bo is one of the few we do have. Their prices are great for Japanese food and they have a giant menu. \n\nI find this place is perfect when you don't want to cook, have picky family members, or are just too tired to walk to the main drags on Chestnut or Union. \n\nThe food is solid. They have some interesting stuff like seafood tempura or squid tempura and these Japanese cabbage pizza things, which I can't remember the name of right now. \n\nEvery time we have ordered to go, the food has been hot and our order correct. When we eat in, the service is always great and the restaurant is very clean. \n\nDefinitely will continue to be a convenient favorite for my family.", "author": "Mitch C."}

Beware, their menu is huge and it took forever to decide!\n\nI tried the vegetable croque, California roll, volcano roll, tempura, karaage curry, and the assorted sushi. The vegetable croque and tempura were fried perfectly and were solid appetizers. \n\nThe California roll with real crab was good but the volcano roll combines all my favorites: crab, tuna, salmon and shrimp tempura. The karaage is not as good as other places and their curry is a bit milder with less flavor. \n\nI did enjoy their nigiri/sashimi and if you're a fan of sushi that's what you come here for. The assorted sushi came with 6 different nigiri pieces and also a tuna and a cucumber roll. \n\nService was just okay, they didn't really check up on us without asking them for anything. For some reason the rolls came super late after I had already finished my sushi. \n\nThe seating space is limited so expect to come here with a party of 4 or less.

The restaurant was fairly empty and we were seated right away.\n\nFirst impression - the menu is huge. I'm thrilled to have this new restaurant around the corner from my house.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered the veggie okonomiyaki, tonkatsu ramen w/medium spice (boyfriend), and black garlic ramen w/medium spice (me). Food took about 10-15 minutes to arrive, with the ramens arriving first. \n\nThe ramen was good. The broth was creamy and just heavy enough to put you in a food coma, but not make you feel sick from eating too much. The flavor was perfect and the medium spice was just enough (and I like hot stuff!). The garlic ramen wasn't too garlicky so that it overpowered the tonkatsu flavor. The meat was a bit fatty for my preference, but everyone likes their meat different, so I can rate based on that. (5/5)\n\nThe okonomiyaki was great! I probably will order a meat or seafood version next time, but the veggie was good too. It really reminded me of my time in Japan, very authentic flavors. (5/5)\n\nNow the reason I am only giving 4 stars is because there are a few things the restaurant needs to improve if they want to thrive in the Marina/Cow Hollow:\n1. Atmosphere is definitely lacking - someone else mentioned this in their review as well. The lighting is too bright (go buy some softer light bulbs... cheap easy fix).\n2. Restaurant is too quiet and lonely - definitely need a sound system with music. We are in the Marina after all. This is a must!\n3. Upgrade the water glasses to glass, not the tacky plastic ones. \n\nThat being said, I think the food and prices here are just right and I hope these don't change. At this price point, I could become a regular. \n\nI look forward to trying other food on the menu... especially the sushi!", "author": "Amanda R."}

This is one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco and we usually take our visiting friends and family here as well.  We've never had a bad meal here, the consistency after all these years is mind blowing.  The atmosphere is cozy and the family that runs the restaurant is amazingly sweet and friendly!  \n\nWe usually get the 2 item combo, for $9.99 and it comes with rice, miso soup, and salad!!!  Probably one of the best values in an overpriced city like San Francisco.  You can pick from about 20 items on the special menu.  I usually get the Wakame Udon and the Tonkatsu or the Kaki Fry (fried oysters).  Not sure what they put in their udon, but the broth is so simple and clean yet amazingly tasty, very very addictive.  They're very generous on the portions as well.  My wife loves the Vegetable Tempura and the Takoyaki.  We usually get the Spider Roll as well, but tonight we went commando and tried the fried soft shell crab ($6.99) by itself for the first time and HOLY CRAP it was pretty epic.  \n\nThe Japantown location can get a little busy with a waiting list during peak dinner time, even on a weekday so it's awesome that they now have this second location.  This location is about twice the size of the Japantown location and it looks beautiful inside.  You can tell they put a lot of pride and effort in decorating this location.  The food is still of the same high caliber and the service is as sweet as the Japantown location!  \n\nWe highly recommend Kui Shin Bo, I'm pretty sure when the word gets out about this new location they'll probably have a waiting list as well, so go try it NOW!!!!!!", "author": "Incognito S."}

Combining the service with the food quality, this place gets 2 stars. \n\nFood review (sushi only):\nCaterpillar roll: We were put off by the entire roll being cold, I presume this meant that the eel was not freshly torched/grilled/cooked. The eel sauce was also not very good compared to most places we've had. \nSpicy tuna roll: Instead of the tuna being small pieces mixed with spices, this was regular, plain tuna inside the roll with a TON of spicy mayo covering the roll. My husband loves mayo and this was too much, even for him. \nRainbow roll: We upgraded to real crab for an extra $2 and there was so much mayo in the crab mixture that I couldn't eat it. I had to pick all of it out to eat the remaining roll. There were a couple pieces of fish on top of this roll that had an odd texture and color so I opted not to eat those pieces at all.\n\nService: \nExtremely slow! There was only one other table of 3 seated in the entire restaurant and it took at least 30 minutes to get these three rolls, which came one by one. \n \nOverall I ate a few pieces of torn apart sushi that was about comparable to a supermarket sushi (Whole Foods sushi is better!).

That's fine but when we got the bill, they had the tip percentages listed for you to fill in. Not a good way of doing business. I can see tourists from other countries giving them an additional tip from the tip they already included.", "author": "Neil K."}

Reasonably priced and fish quality is not bad, but service is very poor.

We made a reservation for a Saturday night at the Lombard St. location, but did not necessarily need it. There was plenty of seating around 7pm. This is a small place though, so if you have a larger group it may be worthwhile to call ahead. We were a group of 5 and we were seated in the very back which was great since it felt more like a private dining experience that way. We had edamame, sake, beer, miso soup, nigiri, sushi, ramen and fried bananas - everything was wonderful. The service was phenomenal as well. Our waiter was very attentive. We enjoyed him and he seemed to enjoy us as well. Would definitely go back!", "author": "K.A. S."}

The name, Kui Shin Bo seems familiar as there is a chain of the same name restaurants in Koreatown in L.A.

Have questions? Etc.\n\n* The lights. Way too bright.

I've been here four times because I can't make up my mind if I like it or not. I keep going back in the hope to find at least one good dish to make it my \"usual\", but no luck. If all you want is tempura and some sushi rolls then you may love it.\n\nPros: \n\n- Everything from the appetizer and grill menu is great. From croquettes to shisamo to enoki bacon rolls they're all good. Fresh and hot and not greasy if fried. \n- Sushi rolls have been fine\n- Haven't had problems finding seating \n- Service is friendly and very nice\n- Decent price for the area\n\nCons:\n\n- Nothing from the rest of the menu is any good. I've had watery salads, bland gyudon, ramen with terrible broth, and curry with no flavor. They're essentially inedible and even at half the price I wouldn't get them again. \n- Service is SLOW. I've seen people walk out without even having received menus and 100% of the time I need to ask to order as well as the bill. Be prepared to wait. They do seem to be handling a lot of takeout and delivery orders so that may contribute to it. Overall it's probably faster to walk to another sushi place on Lombard once you factor in this waiting. \n- Food comes out whenever they feel like it. Get ready for your dining partners to have their main course before any appetizers come, and then everything else will come at once. This isn't a huge deal, but apps first and then entrees with a small gap between does wonders for the experience. \n\nI desperately wanted this place to be good but I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. The people running it are friendly and I hope these are just new restaurant hiccups. If they can fix the service issues and get the rest of the food up to even mediocre level I think it would be a great spot to eat.", "author": "Paul H."}

The place looks brand new and clean however the ambiance as a whole was definitely lacking. The two waitresses who were there were really loud and kept talking in their own language ( not Japanese ) and they didn't play any music. All I heard was them talking non stop and people walking upstairs. The insulation is pretty thin I suppose. It was also a really hot day and there was no ventilation. \n\nThe food: ordered ramen which was overall pretty good. It was a good size portion and the broth was pretty flavorful.  My spoon was dirty though. They asked if I wanted medium spicy and I said sure which I usually love spice but this was a tad more than medium spicy. My char su pork was also slightly pink in some spots.  \n\nOverall , it was an okay spot with room\nFor lots of improvement. I don't anticipate ever being back though.
