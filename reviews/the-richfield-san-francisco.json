{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-15", "description": "Have you even gone to a coffee shop and asked \"May I get a cup of coffee\" and received the snooty response \"well, this IS a coffee shop.\"?  I have a couple of times over the years and don't really appreciate the sarcasm, particularly when I still haven't had my morning cup.  And while I haven't been given this response at The Richfield, I feel like they want to say that.  If you ask for a cappuccino or latte with non-fat milk (as my SO often does) you are at the very least told that they don't have non-fat, but might be told the additional detail that non-fat milk doesn't make quite a proper type of foam.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, we like the Richfield food and coffee and enjoy the boxing theme and old copies of The Ring magazine to browse.  And the location is sort of cool - what for years was a wedge shaped island off of California is now a small 2 story building with The Richfield in the lower floor.\n\nThe breakfast items are tasty and well made, the coffee drinks are good (though I have a couple other preferences in SF).  So we stop in when we are in the area and in need of a bite or coffee.  Prices are a touch high, but not out of line.  They don't seem big on substitutions, and if you want almond milk be prepared to fork over another $0.75 for your drink.  And ask for Earl Grey tea (the preference of my SO) and they may look down on you as being too pedestrian (which is funny because there is no parking in the area so only pedestrians can get there).\n\nIt just seems that they have a bit of an attitude - maybe it's the boxing d\u00e9cor that brings it out in them.  Hopefully it won't turn people off from going there - though there is a bit of competition in the area with Beanstalk, Blue Danube, and Cumaica all within a block or three.  I expect a bit of attitude in the Marina or SOMA, but not in Inner Richmond.\n\nSo 5 stars for the food and boxing theme, 4 for the location and coffee, 3 for the limited tea selection and perceived attitude.

It's a cute neighborhood spot to pop in for a coffee or a snack.\n\nI just get whatever latte or ice coffee drink that I'm feeling that day, and (if I'm lucky), snag a seat at one of the 3 tiny, 2-3 person tables they have. When the weather is nice, sometimes there are 2, 2-seater tables outside.They also have a little counter that I've seen some people stand at to do work. I personally don't find the environment conducive to working, but it's fun to people watch and read a little on a slow day. I also tend to prefer small cozy coffee shops to large ones.\n\nThe service is friendly, the drinks are pretty average (though they have a few interesting selections and a large variety of tea), and the food is pretty unique. I think the breakfast sandwich is popular (but not a stunner, according to my NYC-breakfast-sandwhich-loving friend). I have also tried the sesame ricotta toast topped with strawberries, coconut flakes, and honey. It's an interesting combination, and I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if it completely worked. Maybe in strawberry season, when the strawberries are a little more naturally sweet, it would make sense.\n\nAlmond milk is extra and they will remind you like Chipotle employees remind you that guac is extra.", "author": "Alice L."}

I grab coffee from them 2-3 times a week, and the staff is always excellent to me, even when the line is long and their small kitchen is humming.\n\nWhy four stars? Mondays and pastries, basically. It's frustrating to hike my butt over only to realize they are closed, and then hike my butt back to Blue Danube. I've more or less got it committed to memory now, but I still like Richfield better; I want to go there on Mondays too. As for the pasties? They are almost always out by the time I get in. These must be the fanciest, most in-demand pastries ever, because whenever I come knocking for some flaky goodness, I always leave empty handed.

Loved the quote painted on the wall and the retro boxing gloves hanging by the cashier. \n\nOk, onto the coffee.. I ordered a latte with almond milk and my boyfriend got a simple iced coffee. Both came out to $9 even. Typical hipster coffee price. Not mad about it all because the quality of their coffee is so worth it! I'm a stickler for strong coffee and I need it in a precise way. I took one sip into my heart-shaped latte and fell in love. It was rich, creamy, velvety, and kicked me with caffeine. Just the way I like it!

The menu is pretty simple, but they do have coffee specials.\n\nThis time around I went for a latte and their black sesame ricotta toast. The cost all together was about the same as what I would have paid for with that original acai bowl! The black sesame toast comes out with strawberries and toasted coconut on top.

Oh no, it wasn't the embarrassing aftermath of some drunken binge at Ireland's 32. As usual, I get my car serviced every few months at the Toyota dealer on Geary. Of course that means leaving my car for an hour and a half, and then what...wait in the room with all the other early-bird Asian owners of Toyotas. Instead of living down to my stereotype, I scrolled the Yelp app to see what was open, and lo and behold, that's how I stumbled onto this closet of a place just two blocks away off California.\n\nThere on the chalk wall is their humble slogan, \"Never surrender if you want to be a contender\", which made me think of Brando's classic line in \"On the Waterfront\": \"I coulda been a contender, I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.\" As I pondered that philosophy, I had to make the tough decision between their two breakfast items, the $6 Black Sesame Ricotta Toast with honey and granola, and the $7 Brekkie Sandwich, which offered a folded omelette, melted cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and some house special sauce that they spread on two slices of King's Hawaiian toast.\n\nNo contest for me as the Brekkie did it for me (photo: http://bit.ly/2amtzco), and while it wasn't anything that extraordinary, I have to admit it was the thick slices of King's Hawaiian that really made this quite satisfying. The luxuriant $3.75 Cappuccino I ordered to go with it also did the trick (photo: http://bit.ly/2a3Lq5H), and it was honestly relaxing to have such a simple meal at a little cafe table. It's a popular spot as a growing number of people started to come in soon after me, and I soon felt guilt for taking up one of the three tables when young couples had to stand at the counter. Oh, who am I kidding?

Cappuccino was perfectly brewed, with ribbons of foam through the deep rich coffee without the slightest hint of butter notes.   Let me be clear about this,... I think 95% of the cappuccinos out there are made by halfwits with no clue as to what coffee is. Richfield did it right!\n\nEgg & bacon on med-thick crisp toast with a touch of maple syrup (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) for flavor was outstanding.  Although the toast was thick, it wasn't too dense, yet it held up extraordinarily well to the generous portion of perfectly cooked eggs and half crisp bacon. It was a pleasure to eat and didn't fall apart. Why doesn't everyone make a breakfast sandwich like this?\n\nI also had a doughnut muffin. OK, I'm gonna be honest with you. It was a dance doughnut in the shape of a medium size muffin. If you were avoiding gluten, this isn't the thing for you. It had a modest amount of sugar sprinkled on top and was delicious. But, it was gluten Central. But, it's a damn doughnut, so what do you expect!  It delivers on what it is and is very filling. Recommend splitting one with someone.  Prices were very reasonable. \n\nSeven bucks for the sandwich. All told it was about 13 bucks including tax, before tip. Not too bad for a hearty breakfast done well in San Francisco.\n\nOnly issue is parking. But, if you live in San Francisco and drive everywhere you're an idiot. Find a parking space within a couple blocks and walk on in. It's worth the small tiny bit of effort. So stop bitching and moaning about the parking and get off your lazy arse and walk a few blocks.  You'll feel better about getting the doughnut muffin. :-)", "author": "Alex K."}

They have 2 tables outside and bench tho, for more leisurely sitting if that's what you're into. The guys that work there are really friendly too. Hit it up if you're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Nikki D."}

The staff were all very nice and helpful. Based on the other reviews, I had to get the Brekkie sandwich (omelette with bacon and cheddar folded over and placed between two slices of Hawaiian King toast). The Brekkie was really good and I think the different part about it would be that the egg is made into an omelette form and then folded over; there's also a special sauce that was pretty good. I also got a latte which was well-made and nicely crafted with a floral design made with the milk. Overall satisfying experience here.", "author": "Will H."}

All of the dishes are delicious. I do not have bacon on the Brekkie, and it tastes great to me. Avocado toast is amazing. Ricotta toast is a tasty surprise. And the chocolate chip cookies- truly truly dangerous.\nService is very friendly, and it is fast turning to a Local's favorite. Sometimes a \"retail slut\" hanging out for hours on end, but we can look past that. My only wish is that they would have more \"portable\" food items for when you're on the go, but this place is a very sweet addition to the neighborhood :)", "author": "roz A."}

Wasn't even acknowledged (with no one else in line) when I came in, the girl at the counter literally looked up at me, said nothing and continued whatever she was doing. \nI ordered a cold brew with almond milk, paid, but then was given one without. Someone else came in and began to order so I asked someone else in the back. He told me they charged for almond milk. I said \"oh, even just to put a little in?\" \n\"Yea. That's what the charge is for\".\nUh ok... Except that first off, I actually mentioned it when I ordered and secondly, most places charge extra for making a whole drink with it, not for allowing you to add an ounce on top...so I could have done without the attitude. \nThe 2 stars are only because, at least, the cold brew was good.", "author": "Therese H."}

Jeff who works behind the counter even gave me a few bike tips. I gotta say, Trouble in the Sunset is still where I'd go for toast but I'll try Richfield's ricotta spread next time.

Located on a little sidewalk island at 5th and California St. -  a few blocks from Mountain Lake Park (in the Presidio) and 1 block from the main shopping/restaurant drag on Clement St.\n\nThey make excellent espresso drinks. Has the perfect balance of boldness and smooth finish for me. Not over-roasted at all, but also not a super light (bright) roast either. They seem to rotate coffees from Snowbird, which are good quality. Their drip coffee is also good quality - good enough to enjoy black.\n\nService is friendly. There are 3 small tables inside, a standing area with a counter height rail, and 2 small tables on the sidewalk with a few benches (and a dog water bowl). Good place to hang out with your dog outside.\n\nBrekkie Sandwich is very good. Big Hawaiian toast with a healthy amount of eggs, thick cut bacon, cheddar, and a unique sweet sauce (you can request it without sauce if you're not feeling adventurous). Haven't had anything else on the menu because the Brekkie sandwich keeps getting the job done for me.
