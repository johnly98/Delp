Scallops were a miss\n2. Prices are too high for the food quality\n3.

She saw us walk in, grabbed two menus and led the way to a table for us to be seated. She then walked away. So we're thinking, that was pretty rude, but OK.\n\nIt was a nice day outside so I asked her if we could sit in their outside section. She grabbed our menus, again without saying a word to us, and led us to the outside section and tossed our menus on the table and walked away. She seemed annoyed that we even asked her to do something (mind you, there were only 3 customers inside the restaurant, including us, 2 of which were already eating). \n\n10 minutes passed by... we didn't even get a glass of water. It's been 15-20 minutes now, and we've been more than ready to order our food. I looked at her, trying to get her attention. She looked straight at us, looked away, and continued chatting away with her coworker. At this point, we're hungry and fed up. We got up and left. She just watched us walk out without saying a word.

Today's visit was less exceptional. The tofu coconut soup was good and had lots of veggies. The tofu spring rolls were okay -- but nothing to sing about. The crispy basil chicken noodles were very well prepared but a little sweet for my taste. I wanted to branch out from my usual pad kee mao and these noodles looked original.

There are 10 Thai places within a few blocks, so I thought the competition would force everyone to up their game. Unfortunately, Modern Thai fell completely short in the flavor department.\n\nWe had the Tom Yum and Pad Se Eww, two staples that all Thai restaurants should be able to pull off flawlessly. Both dishes were fairly large portions and perfect for sharing. The first spoon of Tom Yum was quite nice; slightly spicy tart soup with well cooked vegetables. As we got further into the bowl, there was a gritty sediment (possibly the spices?) that made it very unpleasant. The Pad Se Eww was weak in flavor and the noodles were all clumped together and over chewy. Not fun.\n\nOn a positive note, service was quite good (granted there were only three tables of diners).", "author": "Akash K."}

I was going to give them a 4 star but they're not consistent with the spicy-ness level of each entree or something is always off like it doesn't taste right. The first time I ordered here was last year in October, I remember ordering their thai basil chicken, mild spicy and it was good. The garlic rice that comes with crispy fried chicken is really yummy but the fried chicken was a little dry and soggy. Bf ordered Kho Soi, beef was a little hard. Curry that comes with Kho Soi was rich and nice thick texture but the flavoring was a little off. We can still taste the curry but with a sour taste. Unlike other thai restaurants, I love how I can get their Tom Yum Soup for $6 for a cup but again their flavoring/spicy-ness level is off. First time, I added tofu. It tasted more sweet than sour/spicy like how it should be. The 2nd time I ordered, I chose medium spicy Tom Yum with chicken, flavoring was perfect but the spicy-ness level seemed more like hot spicy than medium spicy. Their mixed vegetable entree is really good, too, but medium spicy was too spicy. What threw me more off was bf ordered Pad Se Ew and was superrr spicy! Trust me, bf and I are a fan of spicy foods but that was sooo spicy that his lips were numb after 3 bites and we had to throw it away :( \n\nI still believe in this place so I will give them another chance. I'll order again next time but not any time soon. I will try mild level of spicy-ness and see how that works. Hopefully I can update my review and give them a 4 star!!!", "author": "Sharmaine M."}

They know my voice when I call to order and they know me by name so you would think they would take maybe a little extra care of someone who eats there frequently...

I love this place BUT Tonight I ordered one of my favorite dishes, \ncashew nut chicken,  and it was INEDIBLE !!!   It was as if I had ordered chicken jerky. THE chicken STRIPS WERE  SOOOOOO DRY and SOOOO OVERDONE THAT you could have bounced them off  the floor. The chef must've dropped 10 or 12 Thai Chili peppers into my chicken dish, because I took one bite and my whole face and neck started perspiring profusely and  this is a dish I eat ALL THE TIME ...I don't know if the chef was ready to go home or was asleep at the wheel or he was maybe trying to sabotage the business, it could be any of those because the dish that he sent out tonight, he should be fired. I have been in the restaurant business for over 50 years as restaurant owner and as a working manager in the finest dining restaurants. Believe me, I know and appreciate well prepared foods.

Admittedly I went during off peak hours, around 9:30pm, but man, if you can be bothered to stay open as a restaurant past 10, good on you, and this restaurant does. My water glass never went empty, which is a good sign. The fish I ordered, the MT Mango, was a delightful combination of sweet, savory onions, bell peppers, chicken, mango, and a bunch of spices I can't remember the name of. All I know is that I downed it faster than I could finish watching a buzzfeed video. It didn't matter at that moment whether I was dining by myself or with a group of friends (though I wasn't, because I'm visiting from the OC), the food was sublime, and that's kind of a rare event for Thai food in Southern California, so it was refreshing to see this restaurant break those expectations. The dish itself was full of mango goodness, as the dish name MT Mango would suggest. I got some rice to mop up the sauce and that was great too. All in all, there are far worse ways (and for me, it was a totally worth it fish) to spend your $15.\n\nI'm not sure why this restaurant gets 3.5 average stars; I'd guess it's because parking in SF sucks (but it does everywhere in SF), and it's not as large good portions as other SF places. But it makes up for it in atmosphere and food tastiness, and service. Anyway, I'm a fan.", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-12-25", "description": "Sadly this place, which was one of my top three favorite thai restaurants, has become an over-priced, over-sweetened, under-cooked shadow of it's former self. I ordered Tom Yum soup, hot tea and coconut shrimp. These three items came out to $30. Which would have been fine if any one of these things had been good, but ALL of them had issues. And that isn't even the only issue I had with this visit.\n\nFirst, when I arrived there was only one other party there. A party of about 6 people that grew every half an hour as one of the marina-types rolled their drunk asses out of bed to stroll in \"fashionably late\" to their friend's birthday dinner. They were loud and obnoxious, but that doesn't explain why I had to wait 20 minutes for someone to ask if me I was ready to order especially since I knew what I wanted before I sat down. And there were THREE people working there -- a waiter and two waitresses. It looked like the women were intimidated by the loud group and mostly just the waiter dealt with them.\n\nLet's talk about the coconut shrimp. A dish I have ordered many times. At least half of the time I come here or order delivery, this dish is ordered. It is even in my first review of this place: http://bit.ly/1a8dsUX I love this dish, it's shrimp and coconut fried together what's not to love? Well what I don't love is biting in to raw shrimp. Not undercooked, but still translucent RAW shrimp. But what I really don't love is when I spit it out on a plate (they give you cloth napkins so I couldn't discretely spit it out into a napkin) and push it to the far side of the table and it takes someone a full 15 minutes to ask me if there is something wrong. The waitress did have the kitchen re-fry the shrimp to cook it through but by the time it came back my soup was ready and I was kind of skeptical about trying it again.\n\nNow the tea. It's hot water and tea bags. You would think it is impossible to get terribly wrong right? But you'd be wrong...  For some unknown reason they sweeten their ice tea when they brew it so I couldn't just get regular hot thai tea. Instead they heated the pre-sweetened iced tea which was way too freakin sweet. Think southern food sweet tea with another pound of sugar in it. The waitress did offer to dilute it with hot water (why she didn't just make it with half plain water and half tea to begin with is beyond me) but it was still way more sugar than I , or any person who is over the age of 5, would normally consume.\n\nLastly the Tom Yum soup with noodles. This is the only thai restaurant I've been to where this dish is not technically on the menu. Here they are essentially giving you an order of tom yum soup with a side order of noodles, which is odd because they have a whole menu section of noodle soups and all of those soups are fairly bland (Even the Starbucks of SF thai food, Osha Thai has this dish). This was the closest to being perfect, but it was supposed to be chicken but I got shrimp. Not a big deal since I obviously like shrimp and at least these shrimp were cooked. And because this is a side order of noodles, there were way too many noodles in soup. There was also an odd soapy after taste to the noodles.\n\nThe waitress, when she did notice issues, did an admirable job of trying to correct the problem. But it took her much too long to react. Unfortunately, this comedy of errors was just not funny when all I wanted was some hot spicy soup and some hot tea to clear my allergy-induced congestion and it took twice as long for me to get half the quality of food and one third the level of service I had come to expect from this place. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.", "author": "Dani D."}

I liked the pad see ew. Portions are always too much for me, so I took half home with me. I liked that they had a lot of veggies in it. There were carrots, Chinese broccoli, and regular broccoli. Usually when I order pad see ew, they just put a teensy bit of either Chinese broccoli OR regular broccoli, but this one had both, which made me happy.\n\nI also got a free Thai iced tea with my entree for checking in on Yelp.\n\nIt was a pleasant food experience, but let's be real, I'm not coming back here when I come visit SF.

Nothing extraordinary, the appetizer I ordered was pretty mediocre (crispy tofu) and the pad kee mao (which I ordered extra spicy) was bland and mostly onions and tomatoes instead of noodles. \n\nHowever, what really got me was that the restaurant charged a $4 delivery fee (I live in downtown SF, too) and the delivery guy had the guts to ask me for more tip.  I told him straight up that he's crazy if he expects more than the $4 I'm already paying for delivery.  He argued with me for a full five minutes before shaking his head at me and driving off in a fancy, nice vehicle that no poor, young delivery boy would ever have the hopes of driving. \n\nSome tips for this restaurant - get rid of your exorbitant delivery fee and I will tip your son for dropping off the food in his daddy's car. Secondly, when someone orders noodles, they don't mean onions.  Please add more noodles to your *noodle* dishes.  Thirdly, good tips are for good customer service and good food.  \n\nIt's a stupid idea that by tacking on a delivery fee that's basically half the price of an entree, you expect to wrangle more money out of your consumers by sending your kids to shake their heads at paying customers.  Especially, when you're delivering within a 2 mile radius.  \n\nThere are way better thai restaurants in SF that I'll be choosing to order from in the future.", "author": "Sw A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-10-13", "description": "This is the WORST Thai restaurant I've ever had the misfortune of visiting. We came in on a whim on a night out in SF, since we were walking past and decided we were hungry.\n\nWhere do I even begin?\n\n1. Let's start with the crappy food. I ordered Panang curry, and guys, this isn't my first time at the rodeo. I know what good Panang curry tastes like. The Panang curry at this place was nothing more than veggies and tasteless, mushy lumps of tofu swimming in peanut sauce. I kid you not. The peanut sauce taste was so overpowering that I couldn't handle more than a few bites. Not to mention no proper curry spices or anything remotely savory. Just peanut sauce. The best part was the brown rice. Which brings me to complaint #2. \n\n2. The check came and I noticed that I was charged an extra $2.50 for my rice. I asked our waiter why I was charged for the rice and he explained that rice with my meal was extra. Excuse me? What planet do you live on? I've had more than a few Thai curries in my life and they ALWAYS come with rice. They have to, because they're usually soupy and need the rice to balance them out. I told him that, and the fact that he failed to mention that the rice was an extra charge when I was ordering, and that it didn't say so anywhere on the menu, either. He went and got the manager, and I told her the exact same thing. She told me that she would take off the charge \"this time,\" but that next time I would have to pay it. Um, there won't be a next time, lady.\n\n3. It only went downhill from here. Because of the awful food and arguments with both the server and the manager, we decided to forgo the tip. (As a rule, I always begin at 15% when I walk into any restaurant, and the tip either goes up/down from there depending on the experience.) As we were standing up to leave, the manager corners me and gets in my face, demanding why I didn't leave a tip. I told her how I felt and she started berating me, telling me that \"good people leave tips\" and told me that I HAVE to leave a tip. I told her I don't HAVE to do anything, including taking any verbal abuse from her. I turned my back on her and started walking out of the restaurant. She PUT HER HANDS on my back and shoulders and told me I wasn't welcome at her restaurant anymore. I shook her off of my, told her not to touch me again, and said that don't worry, I wouldn't be coming back.\n\n4. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! We're already outside the restaurant walking away and the manager comes out into the doorway with the cook, and both are screaming at us as we walk away down the street. \n\nMy advice? Eat someplace else and spare yourself awful food, argumentative service, and a psychotic, abusive manager.", "author": "Rimma A."}

Nothing wrong with anything, the delivery time was spot on, the food was fresh and piping hot.  I have found my new go to spot for Thai.  Yum!!\n\nUpdate, the day after.

Though there were two enormous slices of cucumbers that came on top of the rim of the fried rice plate, which is alright but I think I would have just preferred the actual fried rice to be of better quality. \n\nService: We did have to remind the servers to bring us our orders a few times, including my husband's beer (which was served to him after our first dish arrived, not before). \n\nTo sum, three stars because it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.", "author": "Mona Lisa M."}

But the waitress failed to remember that I said no onions in my fried rice... She said I only said no onions on the tofu salad. Aiyah. Even though it may be a customers fault, should you talk back and say it wasn't ur fault but mine?! It's common restaurant etiquette to please your customers and not to upset them more. Hmmm aside from that one bad experience, all else was awesome.\n\n*Update* Went in tonight for a sit-in dining experience. \n\nThe ambiance and decor was amazingly very nice. They have an outdoor (porch terrace) area that is beautifully decorated with flowers and makes you feel like you're outside, but really....indoors. You have a nice view of passer-byers. You walk in a little more is the main dining area. They have a full wine bar near the door and the colorful slightly dimmed room is where we were seated.\n\nI ordered the same dish....fried chicken over fried egg brown rice. The bf got the pad see eww and for appetizer, we got the fried tofu salad.\n\nI made sure to order the salad and fried rice WITHOUT any onions. Unfortunately, the waitress failed to hear I didn't want onions in my fried rice....so, they lost a few points for neglecting that and then blaming me for not mentioning it. I understand we all make mistakes and all, but if you work at a restaurant, even thought you know the customer MAY have been wrong, you don't accuse them for your mistakes. It's bad customer service! \n\nRegardless, they replaced my entree with what I ordered and I happily ate it! My bf loved their pad see eww and said the dish tasted very fresh and not too greasy.

It was good - nothing incredibly special though. Then roasted duck fried rice and catfish with eggplant. Both delicious and a good amount of food. The fried rice I would recommend. It's a tiny bit greasy but has more duck than I was expecting and you can really taste it. \n\nENVIRONMENT: Surprisingly nice inside. White table clothes, very modern minimal plates. Pretty little bouquets on the table. I could totally see bringing parents here for a casual dinner. It's got a good amount of space - with an indoor part and a weird enclosed patio area as well. \n\nSERVICE: Really great.

The food is eclectic yet you'll find all the traditional Thai dishes-- And the food was excellent... my favorites were the Pra Ram with tofu and veggie Pad Thai.  I also liked the deep fried pumpkin.  Service was wonderful-- they all doted on our friend's infant daughter and were very charming overall.\n\nWe'll definitely be back!", "author": "Janette M."}

At around 7pm the tables were about 60% seated with a few single diners and a large dinner party.\n\nI don't know what I was expecting but I was surprised that the crispy pumpkin was served French fry style. And more surprised to find that they were, in reality, more soggy than crispy. With the sauce it was quite tasty but I would have to ask for it to be actually crispy if I ordered this dish again. \n\nThe entrees were almost back to back home runs. Excellent authentic flavors. Loved the subtle kick in the scallops dish but the scallops were a touch rubbery from being over cooked. \n\nOverall experience was quite lovely. Waitstaff was friendly, prompt and kept the water in the glasses. Space was clean. Decor balanced being chic yet comfy, ie you would be comfortable showing up on date night or casual. The two unisex bathrooms are pretty spacious. And last but certainly not least, it should be noted that the waitstaff will sing Happy Birthday.", "author": "Kim K."}

Here is what I sent to them via email.  Let's see if there is a response.  \n\nSunday, I placed an order through Eat24 for your restaurant.  I have placed ordered with your restaurant 10 times in the last 5 months, I would say I'm pretty much a regular.  Historically, I give a $2 tip for my deliveries.  I order from locations quite close to me, I just am lazy to get up and pick it up.  This time and person that delivered the meal, told me that $2 is not enough and that I need to pay 10% which is $4, that he has expenses, etc, that he needs to take care of, so I need to pay at least 10%.  I was so shocked by this behavior, that I was lost for something to say or something to do, at which point, he turned around and said, \"Ok, ok, I'll remember you.\"  If $2 isn't enough then there are different ways of saying it.  But a tip is a tip, if there is a set amount, then it should be a set charge.  To be honest, I don't get very good experience from the delivery drivers from this place to make me want to give more than $2 and only give that because something is expected, but seriously, a $0 tip is more appropriate most times.  \"Hi, how are you?\" \"How's your evening going?\"  \"I hope you enjoy your dinner/food.\"  Things like this go a long way and reflect better on the restaurant.", "author": "Jason B."}

At the 45 minute marker I called wondering where our food was and was told it was on it's way and would arrive in 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, I called again and was informed that the food had NOT been on the way and that someone would deliver it right away.\n\nBeing that it was already over an hour that I ordered and was misinformed (while my food sat there cooling down), I decided to not tip.  I signed the receipt in front of my office mates (who were all also hungry and waiting) and he says, \"Who's card is this?\"  I answered saying it was mine.  And he said, \"What? No tip?\"  I then explained myself, even though I shouldn't have to.  AS TIPS ARE EARNED, not a right.  In fact, I'm surprised we weren't offered a discount or something being they were late, and disorganized on their end.  \n\nAfter more attitude and nonprofessional behavior from this man, he finally left.  I, of course, was too flustered to check our bag.  \n\nLo and behold, WE WERE MISSING AN ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI called back and asked to speak to a manager, supervisor, or anyone in charge.  Surprisingly (NOT!) there was none (I'm assuming the delivery man had returned and complained about us).\n\nI spoke to the woman who originally took my order and she repeated every item, including the missing one.  I told her we were missing it and she said \"We'll deliver in 45 minutes.\"  45 minutes?!?  After over an hour of waiting?!?

Yeah, I guess just me.\n\nI chose a spot to sit, and was handed a menu. Lunch specials go until 4pm. Awesome! I ordered the Thai Basil with pork. While waiting for my food I had a good look at the place. It was really nice inside. High ceilings, brightly colored walls, and modern decor. They even have an outside area in the front... more like a sunroom. Not really OUTside. Pretty cool.\n\nMy food came out really fast (as expected since there was no one there). Sweet! My rice is in the shape of a heart. My food was not only delicious, but cute. Seriously though, I loved my food. It was quite good, and cheap! $7.95 for the lunch special. I ate everything on my plate, which is normally hard for me to do. And the portions were large too. So that says something right there. Yup, it says I'm gonna be a huge pig at this place. No actually that's not what I'm trying to say, but I will be back, I swear.\n\nAlso to those of you complaining about the Restaurant.com coupons, the staff has pretty much made wallpaper out of the signs saying they do not accept them. So there's really no excuse to give this place a bad rating based on that. They simply don't accept those coupons. Big chipping deal, get over it, and enjoy the deliciousness that is Modern Thai.

I looked them up on Yelp, they had some good reviews, plus a free Thai Iced Tea offer, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Although they have a nice ambience, including a covered outside sidewalk area, and their staff is friendly, and the Thai Iced Tea was great and served in one of those very tall glasses, I thought the actual food was just 'ok.'   I ordered the chicken satay and although it was served in a nice, long dish, the way it was prepared it was a bit dry and not very flavorful.   I then ordered my favorite type of curry, mussaman, which is usually made with beef cubes, but this time with chicken.  Now I've had a lot of mussaman in my many varied visits to Thai restaurants (with R'noh Thai in Larkspur making it the very best), but this was NOT Mussaman, or at least the way I know it.  I don't know what it was but it had a very different flavor, a bit bland, the peanuts were uncooked and there were no potatoes.  The chicken, which she said was white meat, was not -- it was thigh and leg -- which, for some people, is absolutely fine -- but I only like white meat chicken in my curry dishes because it soaks up the curry sauce much better.  It was a misunderstanding -- she didn't understand what I meant by white meat -- so I'm not rating them on that -- but I simply have had better Thai food elsewhere.", "author": "Merrick W."}

Good atmosphere, decent service, and delicious food.\n\nStarted out with the crispy papaya salad, as many other Yelpers recommended. Flavor was great, and the texture of the crispy fried papaya was a nice change from your regular papaya salad.\n\nAlso had the pineapple fried rice with chicken, duck and lychee curry, and pad kee mao. Loved the duck and lychee curry... I would have never thought to cook with lychees, but it went with everything so beautifully.\n\nThe only reason I'm taking off 1 star is because sometimes the service was a little bit slow. Also, in the crispy papaya salad, they included chopped green beans AND Thai green chilis. When everything is mixed together, they look identical. \n\nAfter extracting 2 green things from the salad, I cautiously tested one out. It was a green bean! Great, I was in the clear and assumed they were all green beans, so I popped the second green mystery object in my mouth. Erm... it was not a green bean. It was a super hot Thai green chili. It was really painful and kind of killed the mood for the first half of the meal, and I have a decent spice tolerance. I just..... don't know why anyone would do that. Either mince the chilis, or put them in whole, or don't include green beans.... just do something so there is a clear distinction between chilis and non-chilis.", "author": "Rhea K."}

There is a nice partially-outdoor area in the front and the staff is always quick and friendly.  \n\nThere are three things you NEED to try here:\n\n1: the beef sirloin salad.  It's grilled sirloin sliced thin over cucumbers and lettuce and soaked in this deliciously acidic herb-lime dressing.  The portion is huge and I still can't get enough.\n\n2: pumpkin curry.  Large chunks of pumpkin and meat, peppers, and basil in a really flavorful, creamy, coconut-based red curry. \n\n3:  roasted duck and lychee curry.  The idea of sweet lychee in a curry sounded so strange that I had to try it.  It was amazing.  The fruit compliments the spiciness of the curry and the richness of the duck very well.  It is now one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  \n\nThe lunch specials are also fantastic, since you get a generous portion of yummy food plus an appetizer for around $8.  I recommend the thai basil with chicken and fresh spring rolls with tofu.  For the peanut sauce lovers, the pra-ram is rich and delicious and the veggies are always cooked to crunchy perfection.", "author": "Holly E."}

We were so sad when we got to the crepe and it was closed. Instead of trekking all the way to another crepe place, we reluctantly decided to find something else.\n\nWe stumbled about Modern Thai and woo hoo! So glad we did! You would never think it was a nice place based on the outside... but once you go on, it is so super charming! There is an enclosed outside area and also an inside section. Both are really cute. We sat inside because there was already a couple in the outside, heated area and it was way too quiet to have a conversation. \n\nThe decor was so cute and again..charming. I'm trying to think of another word to describe this place, but I can't. The bathrooms were clean and again..cute.\n\nI order Pad Thai- hands down the best Pad Thai I've ever had. My boyfriend had some sort of mixed meat fried rice- again...best rice ever!  it was tiny and had so many delicious spices! i don't want people to read this review and pass it off because I'm raving about everything..but really..GO TRY IT! Or don't and leave this wonderful place to me. :) AND I haven't event talked about the best part yet...\n\nTHE DESSERT. FBI- Fried Bananas and Ice-Cream. Holy crap. HOT, fried bananas with some sort of raspberry/pineapple syrup and ice-cold french vanilla ice-cream underneath. SOO GOOD. On a scale of 1 to 10 of best ever, with 1 being the equivalent of trash and 10 being like the best dessert ever, I'm giving it a 9.9. my boyfriend and i split it and although it was plenty, i definitely wished we had ordered two.

Despite living in the south bay, we had enough adventurous spirit to embark on this a journey. \n\nWe went to McTeague's Saloon first, but decided to be responsible and eat before drinking. We were totally unfamiliar with the neighborhood and didn't know where to eat. Luckily, my friend pulled out his blackberry and yelped it! Yelp to the rescue! We discovered that the restaurant RIGHT next to McTeague's (Modern Thai) has 4 stars and 177 reviews. Score!\n\nWe ordered the Duck and Lychee Curry, Basil Chicken and Pad Thai. The Duck and Lychee curry was the star of the night. I was really impressed that the curry was flavorful and full of spices, but the lychee and cherry tomatoes made it light and fresh as well. Most currys can be very heavy and starchy with potatoes. This curry pared completely unexpected ingredients together in a very innovative and tasty way...modern indeed. \n\nI have also been searching for a good Pad Thai for ages. I think I've found it at Modern Thai. The color of the noodles were just right...not too orange, not too pale. The noodles were a nice consistency, not too gummy. Tofu, crushed peanuts, carrots on top. You would think that it's not hard to make a good Pad Thai, but I have not been able to find a good one in the bay area so far. That being said, I still miss the Pad Thai from Thai Nakorn in Davis, during my college days. But maybe I'm holding on to just a memory and I'm pickier with food now? I'll have to go back to Davis to see if it's as good as I remember. \n\nThe Basil chicken was just a simple stir fry, nothing special...reminds me of home made stir-frys. Still tasty, but not particularly memorable. \n\nService was good. With 1 bottle of wine and 3 dishes, it only came out to around $65. \n\nAll in all, I will definitely come back for the duck curry and pad thai if I'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "Jeanne S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-04", "description": "Since my office moved from lower SOMA to the financial district, I've missed good Thai. The Westfield Mall foodcourt is mediocre at best and since it's not really a restaurant, there's not a lot of customization if you have specific diet limitations. I've tried three other locations in the downtown/financial area and each were kinda on the meh side. As a result, I've not been getting my regular diet of tasty pad thai or pad see ew or anything of that sort. \n\nImagine my surprise when my friend brought to Modern Thai, located around a convenient corner from where I live (in my defense, I don't really go out to eat on my own so unless I'm with someone, I don't explore the amazing restaurants near my place and usually when I do go out, it's to SOMA/financial district/mission).  \n\nAs it was a restaurant I hadn't tried before, I decided to go with one of my favourites, the pad see ew with tofu. First off, omg what a large plate of noodles. I easily had leftovers to take home since there was no way I could eat everything. Second, there was a distinct lack of grease and oil, something I'd found in other restaurants which wound up wrecking the dish for me.  Third, the food came out fast and the waitstaff was attentive and polite and refilled our drinks quickly.\n\nOnly thing I didn't like was the lack of chopsticks available at the tables. Yeah, I probably could have asked, but I usually expect chopsticks automatically in Asian restaurants, either supplied at the table with the other cutlery or brought out with your food.  I wouldn't deduct any points for this, as it's more of a little quirk for me (I try to use chopsticks whenever I have Asian food, just because). \n\nI would highly recommend this place so far. I'd definitely go back and would like to try some other dishes while I'm there. I'm glad that one of my favourites was done really well though and I can always fall back on them when I'm craving it!", "author": "Cassandra J."}

It had a much quieter ambience than the inside dining room and I actually preferred it more.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of the crispy pumpkin. This is a MUST get. I'll definitely be craving these -- they're similar to sweet potato fries, crispy, sweet and savory with a hint of sesame. Served with a side of Thai chili sauce, I could not stop munching on them. \n\nI split the choo chee salmon with my boyfriend and ordered rice to go with it. Two things I must note: the waitress brought us *warm* dinner plates, which is a plus, and the rice was molded into a heart shape. How cute! (Yes the guys did start rolling their eyes at it.)\n\nThe choo chee salmon is grilled salmon with a red curry sauce and some veggies over it. It was delicious! I must admit that the sauce is a tad bit on the sweet side, but the sweet taste did not offend me like what some other Thai places offer -- you can still taste the curry -- and I stirred in some Thai chiles in fish sauce to compliment the sweet taste.\n\nOverall a very satisfying meal.

We went for a second visit in October, toting our wonderful restaurant.com certificates. On the door they posted no coupons/no certificates as of 9/30/10, but as of earlier that day they were still selling certificates on restuarant.com. I figured we were safe.\n\nApparently not. They completely ceased honoring certificates, which is strange because I've gone to restaurants that simply stopped issuing new certificates, and they still honored old ones.\n\nWe decided to eat there anyway. The food was good overall, as we remembered. While not memorable, it always tasted very fresh. My two young children were with us. You would think it was a quiet Friday night at 8pm, and not an early Sunday evening at 5:30pm, because the other people in the restaurant seemed to stare at us like \"how dare you have your kids eating here interrupting our quiet meals.\" Funny thing was...my kids were very well behaved on that evening and we weren't sitting right next to a bunch of intimate couples or anything. Whatever.\n\nI contacted restaurant.com after our visit (Modern Thai's manager even gave me the phone numbers) and let them what happened. Refusing existing certificates is explicity against restaurant.com policy, and my guess is that if I'm not the only one getting denied by this restaurant that is still open and seemingly hasn't changed ownership, I wouldn't be surprised if they pursue them for fees or whatnot. Needless to say, they could have handled it better.\n\nWill I return without my discounts in tow? Eh. The food was fine, but probably not.", "author": "James W."}

There were pockets in the noodles where the spice/salt didn't mix and made for a horrible bite.  The noodles were overcooked, and the green onions helped minimally to add something to the dish.  Washed down with a skunked Singha and I was done.\n\nPrice - standard price for standard thai, no complaints there.  \n\nSorry all, this place didn't pan out for me.

We wanted to explore Polk street area over the weekend, and MT seemed like a great option for us to start our night with.  I was very excited when I also found a Restaurant.com $50 certificate for the place, which pretty much sealed the deal in my quest for a dinner spot.  I was very excited and told my friends all about it, made a reservation, etc.\n\nWhen we showed up for our dinner, as one reviewer stated below, the first thing we noticed was a sign on their front door stating that they do not accept Restaurant.com certificates.  When I tried talking to a server about it, she just said that those were the instructions from their boss and she can't do anything about it.  When we sat down, every menu had the same sign about not accepting the certificates.  Of course, the boss was not on the premises for an explanation.\n\nAt this point, we felt that it was complete crap that a restaurant would not honor their own certificates that, mind you, are not FREE.  To me, that is not a good way to do business.  Their suggestion to me was to take it up with Restaurant.com.  Well, had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, and now wouldn't have to waste my time calling their customer service and figuing out how to get a refund.  Needless to say, after all of that, we did not even feel like staying there, but instead, took our business to a nice Italian restaurant down the street.\n\nWay NOT to do good business Modern Thai!  I will not be back.  Plenty of other good Thai restaurants in the city.  Moreover, you lost the business of six people that know how to tip well.\n\nNow, back to trying to figure out how to get a refund, which judging by the fact that neither my phone call nor email to Restaurant.com customer service has been returned yet, will prove to be not such an easy endeavor after all.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-16", "description": "I was introduced to Modern Thai by a friend who spoke highly of the restaurant.  We showed up about an hour before closing time.  The atmosphere and decor of the place is impressive, affirming 'Modern Thai' as an appropriate name.  I've never been to a Thai restaurant as upscale as this one.  Tablecloth, fabric napkins, candles on each table, etc...\n\nThe customer service was great and the menu items included a variety of dishes catering to anyone.  With that said, a lot of the options were not traditional Thai dishes.  Instead they were spin-offs of traditional recipes.  Nonetheless, the restaurant is called \"Modern Thai,\" and as a result, I don't regard this as a negative aspect.\n\nWhy did I rate it as a two star?  Because I ordered Pad Thai, and what I received was, to be blunt, the worst Pad Thai i've ever had.  Let me explain.\n\nWhen the dish was placed in front of me, I was blown away by the presentation.  It was the best 'looking' Pad Thai i've ever seen.  Unfortunately it was all downhill after that.\n\nTo start off, there was WAY too much peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong, peanut sauce is great, but let me explain.  Pad Thai is NOT supposed to have peanut sauce PERIOD.  It should have had fish sauce and, in most cases, crushed peanuts.  What I received was a Pad Thai with no fish sauce at all, but instead smothered in peanut sauce AND crushed peanuts.  I wouldn't have been surprised if Mr. Planter himself was the chef in the kitchen.\n\nSecond, this was the mildest Pad Thai i've ever had. It was so minimally seasoned, I didn't even feel a bead of sweat form. It's as if there weren't any red chili peppers whatsoever. On a positive note, the other flavors of the dish were quite noticeable, tasting fresh and of good quality.  Alas, some key ingredients were absent to the palette.  The eggs, bean sprouts, and tofu were definitely present, but I tasted a lack of other key Pad Thai ingredients, most notably coriander and lime.\n\nLastly, and most unfortunate, because of all that peanut sauce, I had the feeling of being 'full' after about 4 bites. I tried to press on but just ended up feeling sick.  Quite a disappointment.\n\nTo Modern Thai's defense, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and eat there again.  After all, I arrived an hour before closing time.  Perhaps they were out of the missing ingredients, or purposely screwed up my meal in anger.  Regardless, it's very disappointing to eat at a Thai restaurant incapable of making a proper Pad Thai.", "author": "Alex S."}

There is a large menu to choose from including House Specialties, Noodle plates, Rice plates, Salads and Soups.  \n\nThey have a great lunch special before 3 PM of $7.95 for any dish and $13.95 for appetizer, soup, entree AND beverage.  \n\nToday, I opted for MY FAVORITE comfort foods a la cart, and not off of the lunch specials menu, from Thai restaurants:\n\nChicken coconut milk soup (tom kha soup on some thai menus) - it gives a combo of SWEET and SOUR.

Ok.. fine... since I was already there, I decided to stay and eat anyways.  Sure beats trying to find parking again in the city.\n\nWe asked the waitress why they were no longer accepting coupons.  Her reply was that they cancelled their membership with Restaurant.com, but the site has neglected to take down their restaurant from the list.  Although I wasn't happy with her answer, I was content and decided no to hold a grudge against them for something that probably wasn't their fault. \n\nWith the three of us, we ordered a few dishes.\n\n- Chicken wings ginger sauce - Chicken was ok.  Nothing to rave about.\n- Beef sirloin salad - I didn't enjoy this too much. The beef was tough to chew and the dressing on the salad was kind of blah.\n- Chicken Pad See-Ew - This noodle dish was the best out of everything we ate.

I live 10 blocks away and they literally show up in 10-45 minutes, average under 20 minutes, so if I'm hungry and want food ASAP this is my go to. Even with substitutions they're super quick.

Drunken noodle - perfect amount of spiciness & veggies\n\n3.

Unfortunately, I did not discover the same satisfactions that Ms. Z did in her recent re-acquaintance nor did I embrace those highs I've enjoyed in the past. \n\nThe salad was off-the-hook. We started with a tofu cashew salad. It was crazy yum. The fresh spring rolls were good -- even better than I remember (though my memories of the fresh rolls here weren't memorable). It was in the entree department that Modern Thai suffered, and man -- let me tell you -- it suffered pretty bad.  Without fail -- out of the ten or fifteen times I've dined at Modern Thai -- these entrees were the very worst.\n\nTo clarify, the ingredients are fresh and crisp. They represented on that, but the flavors were not present. Unconscious, really. The Basil Tofu -- the Ka Prow -- was anything but basily. The tofu on this latest occasion wasn't fried (it should have been, and has been in the past), and while the dish is normally spicy, this wasn't. Oddly, I had asked for it spicy, but instead of using real peppers, they only used a paste. My girlfriend, in contrast, ordered the tofu vegetable with cashew nuts -- which was better than the ka prow -- and she got dried hot peppers in her dish even though tofu cashew is not known to be (or supposed to be) spicy. No, it wasn't a mix-up. She didn't necessarily find her dish spicy; I'm simply saying that my dish would have been better with those peppers rather than those canned pastes.\n\nIt's not as if this was my first exposure to ka prow at Modern Thai. No sirree. I've ordered it numerous times in the past. This was, undoubtedly, the worst. It wasn't good -- but not in the way of a crappy Thai msg-laden place with substandard ingredients. It wasn't good in that the beauty of the execution so evident in the tofu-cashew salad with the delicate balance among the sweet, the salty, and the spicy simply wasn't present. Neither mine nor my girlfriend's. \n\nI wouldn't say that this will be my last time to Modern Thai. I'll give it another chance.  Perhaps tonight was off in the entree department?  It's hard to fathom because the salad was spectacular. I have liked the curries at Modern Thai in the past, but in my vigilance to avoid MSG, I was instructed by the waitress to not order a curry which is prepared from pre-made curry paste. \n\nNote that Modern Thai is no longer open until 3a on weekends.

I was starving at the time and immediately chose the red curry with duck and lychees from the \"most popular dishes\" section. If I had scrolled down to look at individual curries, I would've seen that none of them come with rice. But I didn't, so I got a large tub of curry with no rice delivered to my hotel room. I wasn't sure what to do with it, but decided on trying my best with a spoon and plastic fork and went for the duck. The duck was weird, though -- it seemed very fatty and it looked like weird pieces. Maybe I'm normally distracted by all the rice, or maybe it was subpar duck. The curry itself was good, but my curry and a spring roll appetizer was almost $40 and I was still hungry after picking out the good pieces of duck, and on top of that (!), my daily travel dinner limit from work had been reached. I'd probably try something else next time, although maybe curry with a few adjustments would be good.", "author": "Elizabeth Y."}

All good reasons. Reasons I won't go likely go back:\n\n1. The spicy basil chicken noodle dish was lame. Steamed flat noodles require a sauce thick enough to bring it all together. What I got was a flavorless mound of noodles atop a thin watery sauce. Blech.\n\n2. I ordered it off the lunch special menu but there was nothing special about it. No little salad or cup of soup to go with it - just a pile of soggy noodles. Lame.\n\n3. The so-called lunch special was a hefty $7.95, exactly one dollar less than the dinner rate. I would have been happy to pay it if it had come as a smaller portion with a little sumpin extra. Alas, way lame and expensive.\n\n4. About 5 mins into my visit they cranked up the house music... as in 'unka-unka-unka-woot-woot unka-unka-woot-woot' Gold's gay gym steam room kinda house music. If I'm high enough to enjoy that music, I sure as shit won't be hungry enough to eat. This alone is reason to stay clear. \n\nWhy did I give them an second star? Because the green beans amid the fray were fresh and crispy, the heat of the spice was spot on, the place was clean, and the portion I did eat didn't disturb my intestinal tract.

When we were yelping around for dinner one Thursday evening - Modern Thai surfaced.  After reviewing their menu, we decided this was the place to hit given the glowing positive reviews.  \n\nWhen we arrived, they noticed they had a really nice enclosed \"outdoor\" space but given the winds that day, it would have been quite chilly so we sat inside.   \n\nWe ordered Calamari as an appetizer and it was not bad - a slight bit just too chewy for my tastes.  We also selected the Crispy Pumpkin slices which were cooked in sesame seed and coconut butter - quite tasty!   I also sampled the Fresh Spring Rolls and they were also good - well above par!   \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (Mung Bean Noodles).  This was a combination which have not seen before on the many Thai establishments I've visited.  Overall the texture, with the ground chicken, calamari, shrimp and mung bean noodles was interesting. It was not too heavy on any one item - nice balance of meats and basil!  \n\nWhen returning, I will likely limit myself to 1 appetizer and then the main entree. We boxed at least 1/2 of these dishes for home.  The portions were generous so getting 2 or 3 meals from an entree with a bit of rice is easy. \n\nBecause I checked in using Yelp, I also got a Thai Iced Tea at no charge - that was a nice treat.\n\nOur service was good.  We were there on a TH well before the crowds normally arrive.  When we were leaving around 19:30, the place had gone from just us to 7 or 8 other tables.  \n\nOverall - the Modern Thai serves a well executed meal without being overpriced.

When in the city we normally go to King of Thai. The result...Modern Thai is a winner!\n\nWe ordered the Red Pumpkin Curry. Very tasty and it also had chicken and squash. The pumpkin was silky smooth and wasn't too spicy. The yellow chicken curry was your traditional dish. My brother had the roasted duck with red curry and lychees. Very good mix of sweet and savory. The pad Thai was also served the traditional way. The Pineapple Fried Rice was also prepared nicely. The cashews differentiated it from other versions at different restaurants. \n\nMy only gripes were the Fried Calamari appetizer. It was crunchy but lacked salt.

My friends and I stayed at the Embassy Suites on Polk (if I'm not mistaken) and we yelped a Thai restaurant and this one was actually the second choice. Our first choice, which I don't remember the name to was actually closed. \n\nSo we drove less than a mile away and quickly found parking on the streets which was great since good parking is hard to come by in SF.\n\nIt was around 2:30pm and the place had about 5-7 other patrons and 1 waitress but we were greeted and seated right away. We had a friendly and polite waitress who served us water and took our orders within ten minutes. She spilled our water on the table but all of us didn't seem to mind since we were still feeling the good vibes from the bay to breakers event!\n\nAll 5 of us ordered 2 items each since we were all pretty hungry...the only thing we ate that morning was a Burger King whopper after the race and we all biked/walked back from Balboa to Polk. That's probably more than 14 miles combined!\n\nHere's the food review from what I remember:\n\nPad Thai-too sweet for my taste and the noodles were rubbery textured. If you're a first timer at this Thai restaurant...order something else. I had one bite from my friends' plate and both of them did not finish their pad plates.  If you like it, then great-more power to you.  I've had better (read my Thai-Riffic List). \n\nBasil chicken-good amount for one person and comes with a serving of rice. Make sure to let your waitress know how spicy you'd like this dish to be as mine came out regular...good thing they have chili flakes/jalapenos/etc. They serve this with a side of salad with a house vinegarette dressing which was light but very good.  \n\nGreen curry with chicken-perfect, a must order. Savory and delicious!\n\nThai fried rice-simple yet tasteful. It went well with everyone's dish. It wasn't greasy and neither was it bland. Although a couple of jalapenos added a kick to the rice.\n\nI didn't get to try the other items such as the shrimp dish and the 2 soups but all my friends cleaned their plates except the pad Thai. We also liked the fact that during happy hour the Thai iced teas were only 99 cents (from 3pm-6pm).

When Thai food was brought into the conversation, I couldn't help but give a nod of encouragement.  We ended up on Polk Street at Modern Thai.  They've got a bright patio area up in front, but it can be a little chilly and loud from the street traffic, so we opted to sit inside.  We realized that it was Mother's Day, and the restaurant seemed deserted.  We figured that most people wouldn't take their beloved moms to the TL for a celebratory dinner.  Good for us, I guess!  We had the main dining room to ourselves for the better part of an hour.  I liked the ambiance, with its vibrant lime and fuchsia accent walls and its high ceilings.  It was simply yet elegantly appointed.  \n\nThe food was good, but not extraordinary.  Since there were 5 of us who were game for eating family style we had a chance to sample a variety of dishes, including Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Mango Curry with Chicken, Eggplant and Tofu, Scallops over Bok Choy, and Papaya Salad.  One of my dining companions whom I had just met earlier that day was Thai and thought that most of the dishes were too sweet for her tastes.  I was very liberal with my usage of the hot peppers, so I didn't really find sweetness to be an issue.   \n\nWe also tried the mango and black sticky rice and the blueberry roti for dessert.  \n\nOverall, it was a pleasant meal, but I think I'll probably be inclined to be adventurous and try my luck with another restaurant in the area.", "author": "Evelyn K."}

I order from this place via phone or eat24hours.com a lot and I've never been disappointed. I use to think I didn't like Thai food, but a friend kept talking about his love for it, so I thought I'd give it a go. I started out with the chicken thai fried rice and have slowly started venturing into other menu items. The fried rice is awesome; i love the fresh slices of tomatoes and the portions are very generous! The coconut shrimp skewers are pretty good too. Tom Kha soup is my fav, but it's not listed on the eat24hours.com menu, so you'll have to call to get it. I enjoyed the seared scallops with bok choy too. I just wish the bok choy was sliced into smaller pieces. I get cravings for the lemonade thai iced tea... so good!\n\nThe FBI is my favorite dessert item.. well, i love the blueberry roti too! I've tried the Thai ice cream sundae, but not for me. Good, just more of an acquired taste I guess. And don't worry, they know how to package the order, so your ice cream will not be a soupy mess.\n\nDelivery is alway pretty quick, food is perfectly warm, and the delivery guys are pleasant.

And this is where Modern Thai earns an extra star. \n\nI've been here a couple of times, and I think the food is decent. Their papaya salad and spring rolls are quite tasty. But I've ordered their yellow curry a couple of times and it seemed as though their potatoes were a bit undercooked. And although I'm aware that yellow curry is the mildest of all curries, theirs is beyond mild... while it's not bad or inedible, I recommend trying something else. \n\nOn the other hand, the ambiance here is really pleasant, in a low-key kind of way. I like the bright lime green color on the walls, and the fact that every table has a bud vase with fresh flowers.

Huge portion.\r\n\r\n- Catfish Eggplant - also a longtime \"special\".  Savory eggplant and tender catfish.  Why don't we see more catfish on menus?  It's so cheap and so good!  Sea bass should be replaced by catfish from now on.\r\n\r\nDrinks include Thai iced tea/coffee, and young coconut (in season), served in an entire coconut shell.

It was a toss between here and the busy Chai-Yo down the street and I have no regrets for making the right choice.\n\nThe interior reminded me of Macau for some odd reason but it's very cozy somewhat upscale but not too up scale. Since it wasn't packed like the other place, it was definitely the good choice.\n\nWe started out with appetizers, we ordered the fried wonton, chicken satay, and hoi jor. Fabulous I must say! Though the fried wonton was a little too fried, my boyfriend enjoyed it. Love the chicken satay, the sauce was a mix of peanut sauce and ginger and the chicken was not dry (like King of Thai) but very juicy! The hoi joi, definitely better than other Thai places I've been to; the meat was packed and it fit well with the plum sauce. \n\nOur drinks were Thai Ice Tea, not much to say about this one since they're the same-ish to me. It wasn't too sweet which is the way I like it.\n\nOur entree was chicken Pad See Ew, the veggies were cooked but it was still fresh crunchy cooked, the noodles were not too sweet and not too salty. The chicken, very juicy indeed! Mmm one of the best I've had in Thai food.\n\nWe wrapped up our meal with a special order of Strawberry, Banana, Blueberry roti. I'm not much of a fan of blueberries but I liked it!. \n\nThe service at Modern Thai is very warm and friendly. The decorations in the restaurant looks upscale but food is moderately inexpensive (which is a +). Food presentation was also very neat and classy. The bathroom, very clean! \n\nOverall, if you want really good Thai food with great service and food presentation, I highly suggestion going to Modern Thai. Best of all, it is inexpensive! The food and service was worth more than the price. I sense that we will come back here often =P.\n\nEdit: 10/10/07\nWe've came here about four times now, each time on Mondays after Youth Commission for me and the service and food has still been great! I suggested this place for my fellow commissioners for a meeting and they accommodated us very well even with special orders.

I had passed this little restaurant for years on Polk at Bush Street but never actually stopped to eat there. When we first walked into Modern Thai I was a little taken back to see the entire restaurant was empty on a Thursday night at 7pm. I eventually figured out they do a lot of take-out compared to eat-in as the delivery guy was constantly on the go. The inside of the restaurant is simple and clean. A few of the walls are painted lime green and bright red, lending the \"modern\" to Modern Thai. Other than the colorful walls, the restaurant isn't modern or hip. It's just a basic large Thai restaurant but it does have a few tables outside on Polk Street for those rare warm nights. \n\nModern Thai offers all the popular specialties you would find at any average Thai restaurant. Main dishes cost from $7-12 and appetizers $5-8. The menu has a large selection of pan fried noodle and fried rice dishes in addition to entrees that come with your choice of tofu (vegetarian); chicken, pork or beef (for $1 extra); or shrimp (for $2 extra). I was particularly impressed with the Pad See-Ew (flat rice noodles with egg and broccoli), Thai basil with chicken, spicy green beans with shrimp and vegetarian egg rolls. The flavors were good but the dishes didn't stand out from any other Thai restaurant. I did have one major problem with the food in that it came way out too fast and I mean within 2 minutes of ordering. The waiter didn't have time to open our wine and pour our first glass before our entrees arrived. I found this a bit unnerving that the food comes out so fast. When I questioned why the food was done so quickly the waiter told me it was \"fresh\" whereas I call it \"pre-made\". I was a quite disappointed that the food wasn't fresh nor made to order. Next time they should wait at least 5 minutes before bringing out the food so that you think it was made special for your table. As for the wine, Modern Thai offers wine specials during the week, $15 for a bottle of cheap red wine. It's pretty good too, but it will produce one heck of a hangover in the morning. \n\nModern Thai on Polk is an average Thai restaurant. The food is good but not exceptional. I would recommend ordering take-out rather than eating in. The actual restaurant doesn't have much to offer in the way of ambiance or service.", "author": "Alice S."}

The seared scallops were outstanding.  Both were in red curry, but the one with the duck was more savory and the one with the scallops had a sweeter flavor.  The Thai basil on top of the duck was perfect.  The scallops were tender, perfectly cooked and had bok choy with it in the dish.  Seriously, these were dishes to return for.  They were fantastic.  The rice paired beautifully with both.\n\nAs I said...it will be a new destination for us.  Pros....food is excellent...good neighborhood and the ambiance on the patio is fine.  Server was friendly.

We had a green curry (very spicy, but pretty darn good!), a Thai basil dish with shrimp (though they brought us pork the first time around - oops), and the pad see ew/iew/eiw featured overcooked chicken.  Ups and downs, you might say.\n\nWine selection by the glass is a bit limited, but they have a decent selection of south Asian beer.  \n\nI've heard that this is a better spot for lunch than for dinner, so keep that in mind.", "author": "Evan G."}

The crew there is always very kind and helpful.  The place has high ceilings so not a lot of conversation bleed. We ordered the combination appetizers.  Very tasty, and I think just enough for four people to get either one item or a half of one item.  We ordered the pumpkin curry with chicken - excellent as always. Lots of flavor, great texture - thick and creamy. The pad thai was just right, not too sweet.  We also got the vegies and peanut sauce.  Decent dish, but a little on the bland side. As for Spicy, I asked for one dish to be Thai spice and I think they thought I was joking becuase the food was only somewhat spicy. I didn't even breakout in a sweat.", "author": "Ryan A."}

Mostly because this is where my boyfriend and I come for our \"date-nights\"...when they happen. \n\nModern Thai feels really clean and bright. I love that they have covered outdoor and indoor seating, because sometimes the weather is too nice to \nbe inside. My boyfriend is veggie, so this place has a ton of options for him (almost anything with meat can be subbed for tofu and veggies). We are both a huge fan of the eggplant and tofu, as well as the pad thai. The service has always been incredibly prompt and the waiters give you space without feeling like they are inattentive. I think this is what makes the atmosphere so nice. It feels like you can have a normal conversation without the awkwardness of listening to other people/having them listening to you. Also, we choose the eat the meals family style, and find that ordering 2-3 entrees is enough for us to have leftovers for later, plus it lets you sample more of the menu when you are splitting everything.  \n\nOverall, great quality food, and even if it isn't my favorite thai food in the world, it is definitely my favorite thai place within a 5 block radius of my house :).", "author": "Jessica B."}

Usually we get chicken, but we opted for veggie/tofu this time...bad decision. Weird veggies (broccoli?), no mushrooms, and overpowering tomatoes. \n\nThe red curry with mixed seafood tasted decent, although the \"mixed seafood\" included a lot of calamari (slightly fishy) and empty mussel shells? For $5 extra dollars! \n\nThe cashew chicken was lightly fried I think. Couldn't quite figure out what was going on with the texture. It tasted OK though, but it was a bit on the dry side.\n\nBottom line, it was edible but nothing great.\n\nUPDATE: I appreciate that I got a message on Yelp from the restaurant and that they take suggestions/criticisms from the community seriously.

There are many Thai restaurants along this stretch but this is certainly one of my favorite ones. There are a couple of reasons why:\n\n(1) Simple but delicious food. My favorite is the ground chicken with fresh olives, lime and basil (I think). It comes on a bed of warm rice and is absolutely delish. It's one of their specialties and is affordably priced (less than $10) as is the rest of the menu.\n\n(2) Different seating options. you can choose al fresco dining if you so wish or if Polk Street traffic is getting to you there is always the tastefully decorated 'inside' of the restaurant.\n\n(3) Friendly service. My favorite is the ever-smiling waitress who does not tire of trying to teach me to say 'thank you' in Thai. Let's just say I'm not the world's foremost linguist...\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant experience.", "author": "Felix P."}

Was taking a risk with this one, but the\n                       Yelpers seemed to like this place, so I wanted to put them\n                       to the test. Menu says \"deep fried whole rainbow trout with\n                       green apple salad\". While it may have been trout at one \n                       time, if you've had fresh trout you wouldn't recognize this \n                       bastard.

Only partake if you're craving a salty-sunbaked-\n                       roadkill-covered-in-compost experience. Steeeee--rike 2.\n\nc) Roasted Duck Noodle Soup--- 1/2 inch of oil on the top, 3 pieces of\n                      flavorless duck in a flavorless broth, spiced rice noodles on\n                      the side. \n\nThe total came to 33 buck (including a few coke, 2 comped for being out of palm juice).

I can't even order a dish I've had before at a restaurant I know myself to be good without wondering if somewhere in its reviews another Yelper has revealed a superior dish.  I was already on the phone giving my order when I read Cheryl L's assertion that the veggie pad thai was better than the pad see-ew I had planned on ordering.  I gave the rest of my order to the lady on the phone very slowly while I desperately scanned the other reviews for a second opinion, but eventually had to just go ahead and order the pad see-ew.  She was right, it wasn't that great.  But would I have even felt that way if I hadn't been prejudiced against it before it even arrived at my door?  Maybe I actually liked the dish.  I just don't know anymore!\n\nOne thing I do know for sure is that their sticky black rice with mango wasn't sweet enough and it was too dry.  I liked the black rice with its rougher texture, but it really needed some sort of sauce like they put on the sweet sticky rice at Osha.\n\nThe other couple of dishes I had were very unremarkable.

They have a beef noodle soup that's kind of like pho, with a Thai twist I guess, and their barbeque pork soup with dumplings and egg noodles is super hangover food.

I actually prefer the sauteed pumpkin with chicken over the pumpkin curry; it still has the creamy flavor and sweetness of the pumpkin and great texture, but I feel that it is lighter than the curry (important when you order as much as I do!).

(one made the point there are way more black CEOs than gay ones. another said maybe they just didn't come out about their sexuality, whereas a black man obvsiously can't hide his color.) made for good eavesdropping. \n\nthe service was friendly and efficient. the food was pretty yummy, if a little lacking in the spice department. next time i will ask for the beef salad spicy and see if that helps things. the pad thai was great, very moist and peanuty with tons of friend tofu and a good number of shrimp. we also liked the minced chicken with basil, tho it also could have used a bit more kick. \n\nok and maybe this is minor, but it still made an impression on me... i think we had possibly the coldest bottles of singha ever. super refreshing. this place is perfect for a quick meal before a show at the great american. and for a lil eavesdropping.", "author": "rachel p."}

This sealed the deal.  We made our way from the hotel over to Modern Thai which was a short little bus trip but a lot of walking. We arrived and enjoyed the warm bright colors and the simplistic design of the restaurant. We each had a glass of wine and then ordered the v rolls. Yum! For our entree we had the sauteed pumpkin tofu (made extra spicy) and the pad thai with crab. WOW! I've had pumpkin at other thai restaurants in LA and they normally don't cook the pumpkin well enough or do anything to enhance the flavor. This was perfect!  The pad thai was a big serving and we had plenty left over. This satisfied our hunger for the night.  This was probably the cheapest meal we had in SF but it was so damn good.", "author": "Glenn M."}

This is fried tofu glazed with house special sauce then topped with crispy basil. I can't say enough about this dish. The crispy basil is just delicious. Please, for your own sake, try it.\n\nCoconut shrimps - Deep fried skewered marinated shrimps, coated with shredded coconut, served with sesame soy sauce. Need I say more?

(yes it has happened at another thai restaurant and i am not going to name names because the manager apologized profusely and i ended up getting my order for free).\n\nthe food is solid. and more often than not, better than solid.  some of my favorites are\n\nappetizers:\nbasil tofu, crispy tofu and spring rolls.  i prefer the crispy tofu over the basil tofu, but if you are a fan of thai basil then i strongly suggest the basil tofu.  sometimes the crispy tofu is a little dry, but i actually like that with this tofu. for some reason it sops up the sweet and sour and peanut sauce a little bit better.  the fresh spring rolls are fantastic and a great way to tantalize the palate with many different flavors before your main course.\n\nsalad\nthe only salad i have ever had was the ppy salad. wow! so good! if you like papaya then this is the salad for you. so fresh. so tasty. so simple. \n\nsoups\ntom yum: the quintessential thai soup done very well here. \nseafood tom yum: when you are feeling a little more adventurous get the seafood version. its pretty expensive at around 11 bucks, but if you are in the mood for a more protein filled version of the soup this is the way to go.\n\nnoodles/rice:\ni have had the pad thai (i know-so boring). but honestly it is rather good here. sometimes the noodles come a little clumpy and i can only assume this is because it has been sitting around for like 20 minutes. but it is still tasty.\n\npineapple fried rice: a must order. i get it every time. it is so good and the pineapple perfectly offsets the salty nature of the fried rice. add cashews and perfectly cooked onions and this is some of the best fried rice i have had. oh yea it also comes with chicken and shrimp!\n\ngreen curry fried rice: tasty but rather simple. not much going on. but then again once you taste the pineapple fried rice i doubt you will try any other.\n\nentrees:\nsauteed eggplant: really great flavors. the only problem is sometimes the eggplant comes a tiny bit mushy because it is overcooked and then sits in a delivery bag for 20 more minutes.\n\ncurries: i have had almost all the curries (save for the pumpkin curry). they are all rather solid. i prefer the red or mango red. overall i dont think you will be disappointed with the curries. not as good as some thai restaurants i have been to, but definitely not bottom of class either.\n\nmy top recommendations are:\ncrispy tofu, ppy salad, seafood tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice, sauteed eggplant.", "author": "Jason B."}

We live in the neighborhood and have walked by to this odd Thai restaurant next to the odd video store with porn posters for years. Porn posters aside, it always seemed a little weird and empty. Recently, the restaurant was renovated on the inside and we decided to give it a shot. Chai-Yo is up the street and good but their service is pretty much that they could care less about you. \n\nSo we went to Modern Thai and before they sat us, they already decided that we were going to be less important than other guests. They gave us the crappy small table by the door, in the walkway/thoroughfare for the servers going to the front patio, and gave us that unveiled annoyed look since we didn't want a Thai Ice Tea or Coffee right off the bat. Good start...\n\nWe had opted to sit inside instead of the unheated outside portion because it was a cool night. In the end, we should have just sat outside so we would have kept our coats on. In that case, we wouldn't have been freezing when the servers left the door open, blasting us with cold air. I closed the door a couple of times but the \"customer service-oriented\" server kept leaving it open. Once the host told us he would close the door but it stayed open after a couple of minutes. Brrrrrrrr. \n\nThen an exuberant party of 10 arrived for their table of 6 so they need to wait, joking, laughing, and hovering over our crappy (cold) table. And yes, the door was open. \n\nOh, and the food. It wasn't even good. Definitely the worst in the neighborhood. I'd rather get abused at Chai-Yo(Momma) or walk to the Loin (Thai House Express or Osha) or even venture to Russian Hill. \n\nSo, to sum up, underwhelming food, annoying service, and don't get stuck at the crappy small table on a cold night.", "author": "joseph j."}

I have been eating here for a little over two years now and I have never had a meal that wasn't delicious. My favorite menu items and the ones that I always recommend are First and foremost the Pumpkin Curry with chicken or tofu and brown rice. Second hands down is the amazing sauteed eggplant with Thai basil, as a person who cooks, i have yet to cook eggplant well, Modern Thais is \"perfect\" just the right tenderness. I also enjoy the coconut soup with chicken before bedtime or if I am nursing a cold. One of the overlooked menu items that I enjoy as well is listed on side orders, The cucumber salad is so nice on a summers day before a meal and on the patio where I enjoy watching the Neighborhood Polk Street Riffraff. All in all, I've tried almost everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed. If you like your Thai more on the spicy side then tell them and I'm sure they can heat you up!", "author": "Rodney A."}

We have been going for about a year and have yet to try most of what they have on the menu as we keep ordering the same few dishes we'd tried initially: Ground Chicken with Chinese Olive (very unique flavor with the right amount of zing), Tom Yam with shrimp (such fresh ingredients) and Ginger Rice with Fried Chicken (i love all things ginger).  They are just so good and we get these random bouts of craving for them.  Portions are also huge so we've never had space for appetizers but when we can sneak in dessert, we always go for the sticky rice with mango (again, first dessert we've tried and we keep going back for the same).\n\nWe really need to try the rest of what they have to offer, especially after reading about the rave reviews on the springrolls and anything duck.\n\nJust love the airy, roomy, colonial feel to the place and the service is excellent.  A sanctuary within the TL surroundings.\n\nLove that they do delivery too!", "author": "Karen Y."}

YUM!  Their Blueberry Roti drew us in for a mid-afternoon snack.  Their friendly service and yummy food keep us going back.\n\nFavorite dishes: pumpkin red curry, spicy green beans, praram -- veggies and tofu with delicious peanut sauce.\n\nI like the clean modern design of their restaurant; the high ceilings add to the elegance, even though it's not a fancy place.

I ordered the wonton noodle soup, fresh rolls with shrimp, and blueberry roti.  The wonton soup was a solid 3 stars.  It had a good amount of wontons, veggies, and bbq pork, but it lacked a bit on flavor.  Considering that they delivered this piping hot and the noodles were not soggy, I should probably upgrade that to 4 stars.  The fresh rolls were \"fresh\" and the sauce was nice tangy sweet.  I would've liked a little bit of spice in the sauce, but otherwise, it was great.  I imagine the blueberry roti is better eaten in the restaurant, where it would be warm, but as we got delivery and ate this last, it was cold.  That said, it was pretty tasty for cold roti!  I have a feeling that if I order some curry next time, I will like the place even more!  Good choice for Thai delivery!", "author": "Amy C."}

We were searching first for somewhere around Union Street, then the Marina, and ended up here. My friend had the pra ram tofu, a dish with crispy fried tofu and veggies sauced up in a beautiful peanut sauce. I had pumpkin curry with the brown (a bit more like red) rice--such good spicy heat and nicely cooked veggies, not to mention pumpkin cooked just right. The dessert, a sweet blueberry roti, made for a very nice ending, if not a somewhat unusual yet pleasant one. Not cloyingly sweet, this treat was also rather rich, with a heft I have never experience from its savory cousin that's more readily found in hawker and Indian cuisine. This seemed to come from a thicker version of roti as well as what seemed to be sweetened condensed milk (but surprisingly balanced in sweetness). In this light, my friend's and my choice to split the dessert was a good call. I hope to return to try a standard such as the pad thai, as well as the thai iced tea.", "author": "Ryan T."}
