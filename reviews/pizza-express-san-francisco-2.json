I think it could have used more sauce, but cheese was a good amount. \n\nThey have nice tasting parm cheese on side. Crushed red pepper were good.", "author": "Shruti D."}

I can't even remember how long. \n\nIt's seriously my favorite place for a solid, nothin-too-fancy, delivery pizza. The regular crust is thick but it's a good airy dough w nice outer crunch (and great w/ a little olive oil or other dip/spread). Also a big plus, they're nice and fast, and it always arrives hot out at my place on the other side of the 280. \n\nThere's a few joints the deliver around here where you can get a slightly cheaper pizza, but I depend on Pizza Express whenever I'm in the mood. I know they're gonna have what I want - and they always deliver :)", "author": "Kilian F."}

All agreed it was decent for the price and in terms of taste for a quick pizza delivery. Very basic pizza's with a thick crust but you can certainly add more toppings if you wish for an additional fee.\n\nThe pizza arrived hot with melted cheese (that wasn't chewy or rubbery).

You get a bit of a sticker shock seeing slices go for $3, but it's a double slice! Ordered 3 slices. 2 was enough to fill a medium box, and they had to put a 3rd slice in a smaller box. \n\n2 slices was more than enough for me (and I eat a lot, and I had just finished a run), so I would definitely say this is a 1$ place, rather than a 2$. \n\nQuality: Pizza was super fresh (granted this was on Halloween so they were selling fresh slices of cheese/pepperoni only). \n\nTaste: everything you want in a non-fancy pizza. Toppings were good. Cheese was good. Sauce was good. Crust was good. \n\nGreat local spot.", "author": "Nathan K."}

My family has been ordering from here for over a decade from Bayview (not even 10mins from Cortland Avenue where the shop is located) - YET, the pizza still comes at questionable quality and time. On two different occasions recently, we've received parmesan cheese with mold in it. Another time, where half the Parmesan was used from the canister. Today- pizza comes late AND after calling to check on the eta, it's the wrong pizza. Not sure if they ha e new management, because it's NEVER been bad service like this.

I ordered two slices, but the lady at the counter told me their single slices are \"really more like doubles\". When I got the slice, it was the size of a standard large slice but had a cut down the middle. \n\nThe pizza is NY style but on the slightly crispier, slightly breadier side of things. There was plenty of cheese and tomato sauce, and the toppings were good. Overall the restaurant looked and felt simple and clean, though the space was somewhat awkwardly organized with a large employees only section and really not meant for groups of people to come and eat. That said, space is always tricky in SF :)  I'd be down to try their delivery.\n\nAlso for those cashless types strolling in the neighborhood, they do have a $10 credit card minimum.", "author": "Ryan S."}

I USED to order from here like once a week but since I've gone Keto had to cut back :(\n\nAnyways my favorite thing about this place is their pizza sauce. I don't know what it is but I love the stuff - it's so garlicky and flavorful and thick. I love it! Sometimes I just go there with an empty mason jar and ask for them to fill it up and I just pay for the sauce \n\nI like thick crust pizzas and they definitely have thick bready crusts. And the cheese is so melty and hot when you order... they do NOT skimp on the toppings. Oh and I really love Hawaiian pizza (lol I am not a pizza snob) and they have one of the best. I just love the amount of toppings they put on and it's well balanced between the ingredients (ham to pineapple ratio). \n\nI want to be clear though: I personally give this place 5 stars because of my own personal preferences of pizza. I love sauce (I always get extra to dip my pizza in vs ranch), thick crusts (so I can dip it in the sauce), and mostly veggie/ cheesy pizzas vs ones with a bunch of meat. \n\nI think everyone has their favorite pizza place. I personally have like 5-10 based on what kind of pizza I want at the moment! This one is def like top 3 because I found my favorite pizza sauce", "author": "Jewel S."}

Used to be... now it's ok, not delicious as it used to be but still quality food. The reason for my two stars, the delivery experience isn't always the best. Sometimes your food comes perfectly hot and leaving you feeling like it came right out the oven, and other times it's cold like the pizza you get at Costco - when you finally make it home it's cold and tasteless haha you need to warm it up to bring the flavors back to life! \n\nPs. Did the sizes get smaller for the pizza?? The extra large used to be HUGE!! Now it feels like a large, a smaller large at that.. \n\nAnyway the last order was an XL pep and mushrooms with TWO orders of buffalo wings.. came on time but I only got one order of wings. So I called back and was promised that it will be delivered in 25 minutes. 30 minutes pass and I call back. Promised again 25 minutes. Called again, promised again, 25 minutes. Last call I placed I was pissed off, asked if customers matter to them, ranted for a bit and to be promised ONE MORE TIME!! 25 minutes. So my son stayed up to wait for it. Well actually he stayed up to play video games and I went to sleep because I start work at 4am the next day. No delivery made at all. \n\nSo right now, I'm like F you guys, not because of the wings, but because of the lies. If you pay with hard earned money, AND TIP WELL, be sure to receive what you pay for, simple as that. Next time say you're busy, we'll credit you.. something!! But to keep lying.

We had guests join us for the season premier of Walking Dead and we wanted pizza, so we went with Pizza Express.\n\nThe pizza came on time but when it came, the delivery guy said \"sorry but the box is kind of wet, could you check it?\" I looked it, it looked like the toppings slid off but it looked salvageable. I signed the soaking wet receipt and still gave the driver a tip.\n\nWhen we opened the pizzas and did further inspection, we saw puddles of pink watery tomato sauce on the side of the box and even on top of the pizza. Also, almost half of the cheese and meat moved to one side, making the crust soggy. Our guests still dove in with gratitude but the pizza was just utterly embarrassing. When we lifted the cheese off the pizza, you couldn't tell there was tomato sauce because it was so watery. We decided to just return it.\n\nWe went back to Pizza Express to get a refund. They were cool about it but the driver tried to reason out that I said they were okay: hello...

I was told on the phone that it would take 45 minutes. Sounds very fair. I waited for an hour. I called and they told me the pizza had left, so I assumed they were busy and I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I waited another 30 minutes and called to cancel. 1 hour and a half is way too long. I was told about there being only one driver and it was a busy night. I appreciated that Michael called me back to explain the situation, when I called to cancel  before the guy just muttered they were busy and hung up.  I added one star for Michael. I would have not reviewed at all if the following had occured:\n1. I had received a phone call that things had been jammed up and deliveries were running late, so I could have had made a plan sooner. \n2. Or if when I called to order I had been told that the night was unusually busy and deliveries in general were taking longer. \n\nIn all that time I could have made dinner or ordered somewhere else. \nNext time just be more straight forward guys.  \nI understand busy crazy nights happen and I will give them another chance because of Michael. \nI look forward to updating my review with more positive feedback.", "author": "Michelle M."}

Mind you, I have become lactose intolerant in my old age, and the cheese just wreaks havoc with my internal organs (TMI? Maybe). When I get that hankering, I always order from Pizza Express.\nI like there huge selection of specialty pizzas. I am particularly fond of the Cortland Special (which has grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, pesto, garlic, onions, spinach...) and the Aloha ( pineapple, Canadian bacon, bacon, ham....). This brings me to why they only get 3 stars, even though I am a regular customer. There are TOO MANY TOPPINGS! I am all for lots of flavors, but they pile the pizza so high, it is almost impossible to eat. It also seems that there are so many toppings that the middle of the crust never gets completely done and is always a  little soggy.\nGreat flavor combos, but alot of food.", "author": "Jamie M."}

The BF and I stopped here because we were looking for a quick piece of pizza by-the-slice, which they advertise with a janky sign in the front window. The establishment was less than clean, and when we ordered, they didn't mention that they had no slices available (de rigueur at real pizza by-the-slice establishments). The employee who took our order and money seemed to actually have disdain for all patrons (why were these folks over the phone and at the counter disturbing her Saturday?). The three folks who were taking a collaborative approach to pizza making undertook their task with the same confusion as civilians trying to dismantle an incendiary device. After over 15 minutes of waiting with no information or sign of our slices, we walked out. We determined it wasn't worth our $5 to stay for another minute. At least we got our bottles of water when we paid. Needless to say, they're taking the Bernal/Mission irony thing a little far with their name.", "author": "Denise A."}
