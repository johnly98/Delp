Long version - read below.\n\nI fell in love with this little shop about 1 year ago...and I fell hard. When I took my first step through that blue door, I was immediately brought back to my favorite spot in Paris. It's petite but boy do they bring the heat. I can go on and on but if I had to choose one word to differentiate Provender from the 100 other coffee shops in SF it would be: heart. A place that makes you feel at home. The Ferrari brothers do it right. They care about you, what they do and will only give you the absolute best. \n\nCoffee - If you want to know what a true cappuccino taste like, this is the spot. I swear to you, no one makes better coffee than the baristas here. Fire. \nNow if you need something cold - the maplewood cold brew is one of a kind. Sweetened just right  side note: the Growler is the perfect housewarming gift ;) \n\nFood - I have a weak spot for pastries so my heart melted when I had a slice of the sesame banana bread - sold. Chocolate chip cookies (currently craving), blackberry poppyseed scone, almond bread, cardamom cake, bacon goat cheese biscuit and now a kardemummbullar...ahhh I love them all! Best bet - get 2-3 to \"share.\"\n\nNow the toast...you have never had toast like this. Avocado toast is what they are known for (rightly so) but don't be afraid to try the smoked trout toast - out of this world. If you're craving something on the sweeter side, the banana almond butter toast is the way to go. \nRecommendation: Go with a friend and split two.\n\nTwo words. Egg Samich. Get it. Fluffy and delicious. \n\nThis shop deserves a lot of love. I promise, you'll keep going back for more and will always walk out smiling.", "author": "Mekenna D."}

So many powerful flavors and textures uniting in the most delightful way. I honestly cannot choose which of the two I liked more.\n\nAs for the avocado toast, they use an entire avocado and the avocados are at the exact right level of ripeness. Hard to describe the flavor properly but if I had to pick two words, it'd be creamy and tangy. I wish I could eat this for breakfast everyday.\n\nService was a bit slow, it took surprisingly a long time to make something that doesn't really require cooking.\n\nAlso, the place itself is tiny, not much room to sit at all. But what little space they have, they make it quite aesthetically pleasing.", "author": "Jenny W."}

You think I'm exaggerating when I say I'm here every morning, but I am here every morning. \n\nThe Experience: You walk into this quaint little shop at the top of Potrero Hill and immediately you're greeted with the aroma of fresh ground coffee beans and fresh pastries. It feels like home. There's little standing room, but on a beautiful day, perch with your coffee outside and lounge on the benches with a book or friends and watch the eclectic locals and large fluffy dogs walk by.\n\nThe Magic: Quality local ingredients and an emphasis on fresh everything! The Ferrari Bros who designed and own the coffee shop don't skimp on the details. Every part of the coffee experience is divine: from the beautiful ceramic espresso cups to using Andy Town Coffee (the highest quality coffee beans in the city!) to the beautiful seasonal latte art. Everything feels crafted with attention and love. Sometimes I sit in the shop and watch the fresh avocados come in, or the giant loaves of fresh sourdough from Tartine Manufactory ferried through the door. The prices are steep, but when you account for the fact that every bite you have is brought to life with the highest quality ingredients, the indulgence is worth every bite. \n\nThe Tips:\n-- Avocado toast here is $10 but entirely worth it: a touch of Maldon salt flakes, homemade garlic crisps, and dash of spice atop fresh thick sourdough from Tartine. You'll never look at avocado toast the same way again (which to be honest saves your wallet in the long run).\n-- If you are lucky, I will not have bought and consumed all the chocolate chip cookies. They're made fresh every morning and to die for!\n-- The egg sandwich is something akin to heaven with a perfectly gooey yolk and crisp egg white finish. They introduced it a few weeks ago for their 3-year anniversary!", "author": "Jessica M."}

The place has a very cute decor although it was a lot smaller than I pictured it. There are a few seats inside for you to eat at and quite a good amount of seating outside although it fills up pretty quickly. Lots of parking in the area which is a plus for San Francisco. I wasn't that impressed with the variety of baked goods that were available but I went during the afternoon so maybe there is more to choose from in the morning. \n\nI ordered a mocha and the almond butter + banana + honey toast. So first things first, it is expensive. Both items came out to $14 and some change. Now, the toast is quite large so compared to The Mill's toast, it is a bit more substantial. You get 2 really big pieces of bread with toppings. It is pretty filling too in part because of the thick bread. Pretty good but not sure if it is $8 good. I do prefer the brown sugar toast at The Mill when I want something sweet on bread. I did want to try the avocado toast since many people have mentioned it is amazing, but to be honest, I have been making it at home for breakfast daily so I didn't want to eat it back to back. Maybe next time. All in all, I do prefer the toast at The Mill or Trouble Coffee a little bit more although they both do not have avocado toast and Provender is closer to my house. The mocha was good although also not memorable.", "author": "Cicely T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-09", "description": "I'm going to make a bold statement and say that the simple Avocado Toast here is the best I've ever had in SF (maybe even in the world; however, that is TBD as it's an ongoing debate among my friends at the moment). \n\nLet me explain the Avo Toast greatness:\nIt starts off with a toasted piece of baguette with creamy garlic aioli spread as the base. Then it's layered with freshly sliced whole avocado. Topped off with black sesame seeds, flake salt, crispy garlic, fresh cilantro, and lemon (or lemon+olive oil? not sure yet). \n\nIt sounds simple but the lemon and fresh cilantro flavor cuts through the super creamy avocado and the crunch from the garlic and sesame adds really nice texture. If you're looking for more, then add a sous-vide on top or some bacon. I personally just learned to ask for some chile flakes on top to spice things up. Lastly if you're lucky and get to enjoy your avo toast at the shop, one of them make the toast into a shape of a heart *swoon*\n\nAll this paired with a nice cup of coffee just makes my morning. The downside is that it's pretty pricey and the shop is small like most people have mentioned.

Happy dancing right now, since I'm not always about making the trip out to downtown or the Ferry building to stand in line with tourists or FIDI workers for my go to New Orleans iced coffee at Blue Bottle. There may be some days for that, but there are other days where I simply want to chill and hit up a neighborhood spot that none of the tourists frequent. \n- Literally a hole in the wall with just a few bar stool seats. There is not much more to ask for, it's a nice local discovery.\n- Maplewood cold brew, order it! If you love New Orleans iced coffee at Blue Bottle, this one pretty gives it a run for it's money with more of brown sugar hint and slightly sweeter, but the same chicory taste to it. \n\nImprovements\n- None really, I came really early when they first opened on a Tuesday and I got the last cup of Maplewood cold brew. Thank the coffee gods I did not leave empty handed! Not really a laptop setup/working space type of place, but good to grab and go or a chill spot for a little bit if you want to break away from the hustle and bustle of the crazy downtown crowds. \n- Opened at 7:30AM, wish it was a tad earlier, but having this option is already exciting enough and coffee in the morning is all that I need.\n\nTips\n- Street parking only\n- They also serve some unique breakfast pastries and avocado toast that I have yet to try.", "author": "Tracy T."}

Hey no wonder all the lamest, smug, rude people I've ever come across in SF seem to frequent this establishment.\"  OUCH...\n\nI really liked Provender on first impression until I had the worst all around cafe experience of my life. Firstly, the guy behind the counter was really rude when I asked if there was egg on the 15$ avo toast. \"Ummmm... no. It's avocado toast. It has avocado on toast.\" \nI'm apparently the only customer they have had who thinks 15$ for just avocado on toast is a bit excessive. The barista could have simply replied with a pleasant no sir without giving me attitude.\n\nWhat really irked me and led to a more negative experience was the second big issue per a rude self righteous customer in line behind us commenting about how we had a bag with us that we shouldn't be ordering our coffee with a single use cup \"I can't believe you have a big bag and don't have a coffee mug to save using a disposable cup!\"  (Lady, maybe you should be complaining to single use coffee cup and 15$ avo toast cafe management and not a first time customer. I'm all about using a reusable cup but keep the comments to yourself you smug &$@*%!!!!!)\n\nOverall, in three visits to this cafe I have had one rude experience with staff and two poor and offensive experiences with patrons.

Bonus points if it comes with a straw.\n\nIn the neighborhood and dying of heat, I whipped out my phone and Yelped for the closest bougie coffee joint. Provender caught my eye because of the Maple Cold Brew that kept popping up on reviews. (On the menu, it's actually Maplewood Cold Brew.) Hopefully on such a hot day, they still had some left over. Provender is suitable for just grabbing a cup/pastry and jetting. It's not much cooler inside the store than outside, and there's not much room to sit. Luckily, the Maplewood Cold Brew doesn't take long to order and serve up. It's literally poured into a cup with ice from a pitcher. The quantity you get is not super generous considering you're paying $4 per cup (with ice already in there!), but I had to try their signature menu item at least once.\n\nThe Maplewood Cold Brew... with no additions, it's deliciously bittersweet. It's pretty balanced between maple-sweet and black coffee-bitter. Pretty refreshing, without getting too cloying. Messes with your mind long enough to get you to stop thinking about the heat outside, at least. Do they soak actual maplewood in coffee? Do they just mix tons of maple syrup in a bunch of coffee?

Decided to come here for a quick coffee and some food before heading in to work. But it doesn't open until 8!! Seems kinda late for a coffee spot, especially on weekdays when people need to head in to work and it takes at least half an hour to get to downtown from this location. But at least it's right next to the inbound 10 and 22 buses. \n\nIt's pretty small so there's only bar seating with three stools inside and I think a bench outside. The decor is nice and classy- what you would expect from a third wave coffee shop in the city. \n\nTried the quick cup coffee that's around two dollars. It's not bad- but also not amazing. \n\nTheir toast is quite pricey. But sound so good! The avocado toast sounds bomb, but it's ten dollars. I know it's SF, but dammmmmmmmn. Opted to try the almond butter, banana, honey and sea salt toast (\"only\" $8). Presentation is FANTASTIC (see photo).  It is served on a Heath plate. Taste was disappointing :( The bread is really good- thick slice and comes out warm. I think it's from PAIN bakery- not sure where that is, but they specially point out the bread origin on their menu, so I assume it's one of the bougie, popular bakeries that are overpriced, overcrowded, but damn delicious in the city (or elsewhere in the Bay Area). Overall, though, the dish is too sal- the sea salt was overpowering because the honey wasn't very sweet and the almond butter was not at all sweet. I think it would have balanced better if they used sweeter honey to counteract the saltiness of the sea salt. \n\nCool that they have a stamp card! Buy ten drinks and get one free- and if you flip to the other side, it's buy ten get one free for sandwiches and toast. We saw the scones come right out of the oven and they looked super tasty- must try next time!", "author": "Josephine L."}

They definitely did not skimp on the avocado either - there was plenty in each mouthful, in fact I found myself wishing there was more bread in each bite. I paired my toast with a $2.50 drip coffee, which was self-serve and pretty flavorful. The blend I chose listed flavors of buttered toast and peat. My boyfriend thought it just tasted like dirt.

It's a tiny place, so don't expect to be able to sit down and eat: there's a small bar along the window with 2 seats, so you can probably perch and eat for a little bit if there's room. Otherwise, there's one bench outside.\n\nThey have some of the best coffee in the city - with a wide variety of choices: latte, americano, cappucino, gibraltar, mocha, and more, and teas if that's more of your thing. My only gripe was that for the price ($4 for a latte), it came in miniature cup. I felt like I was drinking out of a child's sippy cup. You can't select the size of your drink, so you're stuck paying a lot of money for a small amount of coffee.\n\nThey have a decent food selection for such a small place that has such a strong coffee focus, with a few healthy options. We opted for avocado toast ($8), which comes on a thick slab of rye toast, and basically an entire avocado placed on top of each half of toast. It's sprinkled with garlic bits, salt, and black sesame and it's delicious. I still love Jane's (on Fillmore or Larkin) avocado toast more, but this is still pretty good.\n\nThe salad ($8) seems to be seasonal, and the one I had was wheat berries, squash, olives, almonds, and capers. It was really good - a bit on the small side, but tasty and healthy. Add a sous vide egg for $2, and it's a great addition (to pretty much anything)\n\nThey also have baked goods that seem to run $3-4 a pop: chocolate chip cookies, black sesame banana bread, scones, that I'll have to try some time. They also have 2 sandwiches to choose from.\n\nOverall, a solid coffee & food place in Potrero, and probably one of the better in the neighborhoods.

Definitely on the pricier side of things but the stuff was very good. As a chai snob, I am always running into cinnamon heavy versions but this one had the right mix of the spices in the chai. The space itself is very small but the benches outsides and the parklet a block over are convenient sit down + people watching spots. \n\nBetween this place, Farley's and the Philz down the street, Potrero seems to have come alive with a good mix of coffee/tea places.", "author": "Rahul H."}

That being said, upon finding it, I was overwhelmed with what I should order.  Without doing too much internet consultation, and after being offered a sample of a chocolate chip cookie Provender is looking to offer, I decided on the Maple Wood Cold Brew.  Much to my surprise, the cold brew isn't served black but rather with some milk, maple syrup, and maple extract (hence the \"maple\"... ::light bulb flashes::).  While I'm generally not a sweet coffee person, this was actually incredibly delicious, so I'm almost glad that I went into this without too much knowledge since I know it's something I wouldn't have ordered had I known what goes into it.  Sightglass is the name game here, and they've got a number of delicious looking pastries for sale as well.  The guys working behind the counter were incredibly nice and welcoming (which isn't always a guarantee this days). If it weren't for the somewhat complicated parking situation in the neighborhood, I would definitely make a habit out of coming here!", "author": "Lisa I."}

My girlfriend got a hot chocolate. Both were lacking strong flavors. My chai latte tasted watered down, not frothy and creamy the way I like. The hot chocolate tasted of dark chocolate, which I actually like, but it unfortunately was also a watered down version of what it should be. \n\nBut the chocolate chip cookie definitely made up for it. They even warmed it up for us. It was greasy, crispy on the edges, soft in the middle, top with a little sea salt. Nom nom nom :)", "author": "Melyssa A."}

Austin especially is a familiar face from the times I enjoy dinners at Hillside Supper Club and is always great to speak with.\n\nProvender is what a true espresso bar should be IMO.  You go in get your cafe to drink at the bar and enjoy a chat, pastry and be on your way.  Of course they do have to-go cups if you need that Cappuccino for your walk/drive to work :)  They also branch out a bit and offer an eclectic menu of food items like Avocado Toast and Leg of Lamb Sando.  I particularly enjoy the Bacon, Goat Cheese & Green Onion biscuit.\n\nI plan on Provender being a part of my weekly routine from now on!", "author": "Ed F."}

I appreciate that they load it up with the avocado and use a big piece of bread...other places really skimp on that stuff.

I came in to order and the two guys were chatting to each other and some other customer and ignored us for what felt awkwardly long so I felt like walking out. It was kinda bro-ey and they had really loud music so it felt like I was not welcome and it was a bit intimidating tbh. I asked for a chai latte and then asked if it could be iced and the barista seemed a bit cagey but said yes thats fine.I said if you don't do it its no problem but then he said no no its fine I will do it. I felt really stupid. So I waited at the bench and then after 10 mins I tried to make eye contact since about 5 people got served after me. Eventually the guy looked over at me and said \"Oh right yeah was I meant to be making something for you?\" and I told him my order again but I felt like saying \"Yeah thats what the money I gave you 10 mins ago was for\". He didn't seem sorry at all and I just felt like asking to cancel it so I could leave. After 5 mins he shouted my drink and then just turned away and I said \"Thanks\" and left. After 15 mins I thought at least I got my drink. But the chai wasn't even spicy! It tasted like plastic mixed with milk. It was so bad I threw it away. The whole experience was awful. I will never be back. I just hate these hipster places who make you feel like a total a-hole just for existing and trying to give them money in exchange for services.

If coffee tasted like this, i would not drink it. Anyway I did not say anything, as they were so nice in making me another drink, but i poured it out on the street and brought the cute ceramic cup back in. \nI noticed other posts also mentioning terrible bitter (in my case sour) coffee. \nSo much for treating myself to a yummy $4 coffee on this fine day.  \nI hope this post gets read and that they (owner)seriously considers using a different coffee and/or a different blend, I can't think of anyone that would find it tasty.", "author": "Diana B."}
