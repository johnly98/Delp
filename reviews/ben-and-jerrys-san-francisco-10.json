You see the metallic pellet that is your temporal transponder puked out in the muck and instinctually pop it back in your mouth and hard swallow. \n\n Time jumps are never fun. \n\nYou stand up, bit disoriented still, wipe your mouth, and look around. The rivers of people passing by don't give you a second look. \n\nIn your world, Ukrainian militarized dolphins that came through The Chasm and partied on spring break and enslaved the vast majority of humankind through advanced interstellar-technology and military strategy, have taken over the world. \n\nhttps://bit.ly/2rJgGQT\n\nYou've time jumped to the not so distant past to convince Jeremy Wade, master fisherman and star of Animal Planet's acclaimed show, River Monsters, to help you catch and kill Rick the Dolphin, who will eventually become the dolphin's Supreme Leader. \n\nYou take a quick look around and see people everywhere. People. Just living their lives and all walking down the street. \n\nYou know you are on a tight timeframe but you see a Ben, Jerry, and Frank's and you can't remember the last time you had ice cream or if you'll ever have the chance to delight in some again. A quick stop won't hurt you think. \n\nYou walk into the Ben, Jerry, and Frank's and look at the flavors. \n\n'Porpoise-fully Chocolate'\n'Dare to Dolphin-ish the Pint Vanilla'\n'Rotten Sex Moose'\n\nLooking at the names of the flavors raises the alarm hairs on the back of your neck.

THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A FRANK!\"\n\nThat's when you notice the shock collars around the necks of the visibly malnourished teenagers behind the counter. And the people walking down the street being poked with electric prods by the dolphins behind them. \n\nIt's been theorized that opening a time portal could also slit an entry into a parallel universe and you just became firsthand witness to that truth.\n \nIf this is no longer your world then do you still have your mission?\n\nYou slice the heads off the teenagers with your SpecterBlade to put them out of their misery and go behind the counter and eat handful scoops of 'Porpoise-fully Chocolate.' \n\nThe nano-tech combat suit you forgot you were wearing sparks back to life. They don't do well with time jumps. \n\nThe wetware port on the base of your skull warms slowly and your consciousness expands to become one with the suit. \n\nYou look at the Ben, Jerry and Frank's logo painted on the back wall - Frank the Dolphin with a smug grin holding the decapitated heads of Ben and Jerry - and decided dimension be damned. You're gonna bring the pain. \n\n\"God and the Devil may both reside in my soul,\" you say to yourself.  \"One lives an apathetic life of leisure in paradise. The other exists in abject horror to make sure someone pays for the wrong they've done.\"\n\nTake another handful of 'Porpoise-fully Chocolate.'\n\n\"These dolphins won't have to guess hard which one has my ear.\"", "author": "Dave G."}

I swear we are getting taken over by all these Frozen Yogurt aka \"Froyo\" spots in the city. What ever happened to just good old ice cream anymore? I remember when they use to have a large location near my grandparents house in the North Beach district and they would hold a one day only all you can eat ice cream once a year. My childhood memories were eating roughly around 22 cones in one day.....NO LIE!! Anyways today we came here because Mona had a coupon that she wanted to redeem. We ended up getting 4 pints of ice cream plus a smoothie and a orange gatorade haha. Yea yea, I got a gatorade so what?? Stop the HATERADE oHHhhH........(yes very tacky). Anyways this place is usually pretty busy since it's in the heart of the Haight/Ashbury neighborhood.\n\nI feel kind of bad and at the same time not too bad neither because while we were waiting in line, there was a girl in front of us that was totally skipped. I guess the guy behind the counter thought she had already ordered and I though so too until she said \"he just skipped me.\" Well lady, don't tell me, tell him!! Haha. Too bad so sad, should've spoke up so they could hear you! I just felt bad because she just walked her little self to the back of the line so they could see her. If that was me, I would've just caught one of the guys attention. I mean, I was holding 4 friggin pints of ice cream [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VAyb61CscwPslmFYZvR7Sg?select=9PiV0vkHk-xLlMaOD8IlYQ] and wanting to order more. Who do they really want to service first? Haha....... man i'm going straight to hell lol.\n\nAnyways, today we got the \"Imagine Whirled Peace\", \"Milk and Cookies\", \"Mint Chocolate Cookie\" and \"Magic Brownies\"...can you say ew? lol. Well we just took everything home before it all melted. I really enjoyed the Milk and Cookies ice cream. It had a healthy serving of cookies in there. The flavor was sweet and yummy. It was also the same for the Mint Chocolate Cookie as well but I think I preferred the Milk and Cookies better. I tried a little bit of the Magic Brownies that gave me Magic Brownies in the bathroom lol i'm jk. It was basically blackberries with sweet cream ice cream and brownies. The flavors in my opinion didn't fit my palate so i'll leave that for Mona to finish. We have yet to open up the Imagine Whirled Peace but Mona tells me that it's her favorite so maybe we'll review that later on.\n\nOverall parking here is horrible and luckily again I had the Miata and was lucky enough to just circle the block once until I spotted a guy coming out of his parking spot and I quickly jumped on it. It's great to come here and get a nice little cone on a hot day to refresh yourself and enjoy all the little independent shops here. The Haight/Ashbury is famous for this plus all their tattoo parlors and diverse population within this community.

I got the banana peanut butter greek yogurt and milk and cookies ice cream on a waffle cone. Man, the smell of the waffles definitely oversold it. The minute you walk into the store, you're just intoxicated with the scent of the waffle cones being made. It smells so fresh and delicious. The cones go pretty quick so beware. The peanut butter greek yogurt didn't taste like yogurt, it really tasted more like ice cream. The banana flavor wasn't strong enough, there was a good amount of peanut butter though. The milk and cookies ice cream was alright, it had bits of cookies in there.

Not to mention that they let out a HUGE sigh upon us entering. Really?? You're open for another 2 hours. You get paid to be here and I'm not asking for anything unreasonable!\n\n3) Um... $4.25 for a small scoop? Um.. I think not.

We won't be patronizing this business and are encouraging others in our school to BEWARE.\n\nOn a hot Friday afternoon some parents of the newest public elementary school on Haight St.  (Chinese Immersion School at DeAvila) decided to treat our kids to some ice cream.  BAJ is only a block away so we ventured off, about six kids and five adults. \n\nWhen we arrived a visibly annoyed Dan, started serving us, seemingly upset that we were so many people all wanting ice cream and equally upset that we inquired if there were \"children scoops\" available. He admonished us to keep the kids off the short lip in front of the ice cream stations.  This lip is 18 inches off the ground and appeared to be a stepping perch for kids to view and select their ice cream.  \n\nApparently not, according to Dan. He admonished us and told the kids to get off of the \"perch\". Ok,  I was fine with that.\n\nWhen he was asked to get a \"regular\" cone for one of the kids, he said we call them \"cake cones\",  to which I replied \"I call them regular cones\" to which he replied, \"then I'll bring you the wrong cone\", my reply \"then I'll ask for another\" then Dan said, \"then I'll ask you to leave the store.\"\n\nOk,  if it were not for the fact that we had six kidergartners ready for their scoop of happiness,  I would have spun around and left right then.  But,  we were committed.\n\nWe purchased about $50-60 dollars of ice cream and pledged to each other never to return to this business and to furthermore tell all of the other parents at or new school of BAJ's unfriendly attitude towards the children and parents.\n\nNote to Management:  Dan needs some re-training if he is  going to represent your business in the way it is promoted in advertisements ie: folksy, warm and friendly.  I'm sure he has a lot of difficult people to deal with on Haight St., but his attitude is losing money for your franchise.  We will go elsewhere.", "author": "Tom H."}

Service was a little slow, but certainly nothing to get upset about. After all, you're in Haight/Ashbury, so don't be in a rush. Although the prices run a little high, the location is great.", "author": "merle s."}
