Amazing views, especially on clear day. Come when it's cold and foggy, and get the true feeling of SF weather. I have been here a few times and this last go round was with our son. He's 11 and loves to learn about history. He enjoyed seeing the canons, walking in the rooms, and most of all, being under the Golden Gate Bridge. There is parking right at Fort Point. Limited though. My suggestion is to park at Chrissy field, and walk here. You get walking exercise, great views of the city, Bridge and water activity, and veer off to take some trails.  \n\nWhen walking to Ft. Point, please be careful.  Some of those driving to Ft. Point don't always follow the 15 mph rule and the driving space can get tight between those walking, runners, on bikes, strollers, etc.  There is a bathroom stop either at Chrissy Field or right before Ft. Point.  There is no cost to enter Ft Point, but there is a donation box present right at the entrance.  The stairs to walk to the top of the building is pretty steep so be careful.  Watch your little ones too that may want to run around.", "author": "Viclaire S."}

Lived here for over 4 years and last weekend was my first time visiting... TOOK ME LONG ENOUGH. Usually when I have out of town guests I take them to the Golden Gate Visitor Center to check out the Vista Point... I think from now on I'll start taking them to Fort Point for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. The city views are spectacular and give you better photos of the bridge (IMO). Like walking under the Eiffel Tower, Fort Point allows you to see under the bridge and appreciate its structure. If it's super foggy during your visit to SF, come here so you at least have something to see.\n\n2. Less crowded compared to the Golden Gate Visitor center... I think it's mainly because unless you walk from the visitor center, there isn't a bus that comes through there. I don't see the tour group buses come here as well. This makes the experience more enjoyable without the constant parade of selfie sticks and iPad photos.\n\n3. It's free; there is no admission to visit Fort Point itself. Technically the visitor center is free, but you have to pay for the parking. At Fort Point, they have free parking spaces and even if you have to park far down on the waterfront, the walk isn't that bad. Also parking is relatively easy because there are people constantly coming/going.\n\n4. I thought the fort itself was more interesting - there are exhibits around the fort like the kitchens, officer's quarters, gunpowder room, etc. The fort also provided great views of the bay, and it was fun to walk around it in general. There was a lot of history to appreciate \n\nThere are restrooms before the entrance to the fort - unlike the women's restroom line at the Golden Gate Visitor Center, it's shorter (but just as gross). Also I highly recommend bringing a light jacket - it was SUPER WINDY when we came here... especially when we got to the top floor of the fort. The Bay Area is notorious from going from hot to cold due to wind chill factor.\n\nHonestly the only annoyance I had about this place was driving to it - you'll have to deal with a lot of pedestrians crossing and sharing the road with bikers. It gets frustrating being behind a biker trying to go up the hill... there doesn't seem to be any road etiquette.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

This place has a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge, meaning this is a popular destination for tourists to go take iconic San Franciscan pictures with the historic bridge. \n\nThis place is a very dog friendly place as Crissy fields is right along this strip, which offers a large grass field where dogs of any size can go running.\n\nRestrooms are available, however lines may be long. There is parking available much closer to the bridge, so keep driving further down if you're coming from Presidio. Keep in mind that you'll need to pay for parking if you come during the weekends.\n\nPlease be extra cautious as there are bikers along the area so if you're driving be sure to check your blind spots.

And if you plan to bike, you should also be extra cautious of cars, don't think you have the right of way all the time, or that drivers are always able to spot you.\n\nThere is a trail/ stairs that will lead you up to the bridge, but it's a bit of a walk.", "author": "Marc C."}

My first memory of this place was as an eleven-year-old, and I've been back a few times since then.\n\nTo really understand and appreciate it, you just have to stand there, jaw agape, looking at the bridge. You just have to see it. I would take you there, and we would get as close as we can to the bridge, and we'd just stand there and you'd understand. I'd probably go on and on about the bridge, and the view, and boats, and the people, and the water, and surf, and the spray, but hopefully you wouldn't mind because that view is worth it.\n\nIt's not just about the bridge. In fact, it really should be all about the fort. Remember that the Bay has always been an important port for the western US, and this fort was one of many installations designed to make sure it was secure from attack by sea. There still exists today a vestige of this, and although the urban sprawl of even a greenspace respecting city like San Francisco wants to inch in, it's really nice to see the preserved fort as an homage to a time now past.\n\nI wonder what it was like, in those days. To be stationed here. To wonder if today, or tomorrow, or never was the moment you would need to spring into motion. I bet it took its toll sometimes, always being at the ready, but never knowing if you would ever be called into action. I'd like to think I would have been ready. These days, I have things I try to be ready for, though mine are hopeful and forward-facing things, and I try to be ready. But sometimes those things are out of our hands.\n\nIn their case, they were never called into action. No major attacks. And now it's more a museum dedicated to readiness than a memorial based on hard fought battles. \n\nThis spot is hardly a secret, but it's one that oft gets overlooked. If I was planning a trip to SF, I'd surely like to make a stop here. We'd stand there underneath the bridge and talk about yesteryear and all that time of having to be ready, and take pictures, and smell the ocean spray when it crashed into the rocks.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-15", "description": "I think Fort Point is one of the best kept secrets hidden in plain sight when it comes to getting a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. On a day when I was showing visiting friends around SF, Pier 39 was a madhouse, while Fort Point had just a manageable trickle of visitors (and it doesn't suck, like Pier 39). I looked up and saw throngs of people on the top of the bridge, but it was relatively quiet down below.\n\nWhile I've been out to Fort Point a handful of times, it has never been open when I've visited. I actually didn't even know it was open to visitors - but this time it was! And for free! It's really cool on the inside, and bigger than you might think from the outside. There are a decent number of exhibits - nothing too amazing, but I thought they were all interesting. You're able to walk through virtually the entire fort, including the top. The views of the bridge from the roof were fantastic, and getting that close to the bridge really makes you admire this feat of engineering.\n\nRight now (summer), Fort Point is open Thursday-Monday from 10-5. I assume these times could change, so definitely check their website before going. Parking here is free and not too hard to come by. On your approach, you'll be entertained by watching the tourists who rented bikes struggling to walk them back up the hill they rode down. You could also conceivably walk here from Crissy Field or elsewhere if you so desired. Even if the fort isn't open, I think this is the best place in SF to show visitors the Golden Gate Bridge.", "author": "Dylan C."}

I really do recommend you visit Fort Point and take time to walk around it and read up on some of the history. The views are great no matter how foggy or clear a day you get. Parking is ample but you can usually find a spot. There are scheduled tours of Fort Point but I like walking it on my own and the different stairways from iron and sketchy to concrete and windy. You get it all at the Fort.\n\nMake sure to get to the top level and marvel at the archways of the Golden Gate as well as the gun turrets spread about. It's crazy to think that was the defensive stronghold guarding the Bay. You cant beat the views. It's just amazing. From downstairs by Hopper's Hands to upstairs on the top level, it's a festival for the eyes. You can see the city from Fort Point or look out towards the ocean and even the massive iron works that make up the bottom part of the Golden Gate. It's beautiful. All of it...

However, during my most recent visit, the parking lot for GGBP was super packed and I came across this friendly gentleman who directed me to park below at Fort Point. \n\nFort Point is less than a five minute drive from GGBP and it has ample parking along the bay of SF. Parking is free and the bathroom lines down here are way shorter, too.\n\nNot a lot of people know about this hidden view point of the Golden Gate Bridge so the crowd is smaller. \n\nFort Point offers a lower view of the GGB, where you can look up and see the bridge.

I'm Bay Area born and bred. Yet I'm ashamed to say that I only found out about this place recently. Once you arrive, you'll be treated to a breathtaking panoramic view of the City, the Bridge, and Alcatraz. Be sure to take a moment to sit on the rocks and soak it all in.\n\nFeeling ambitious? Bring your running gear too! The Marina to Fort Point route is quite popular among locals. Start at Marina Green Park and make your way across Crissy Field.

To preserve the stunning masonry, an impressive steel arch was built to support the Golden Gate Bridge's roadway, rather than demolishing the fort during the bridge's construction. \n\nSuch a fun place to explore for all ages. Take a tour. Or not. If you're up for a short hike, trek to the newly renovated Golden Gate Bridge Pavilion by heading towards the Warming Hut. The trailhead will be on your right, follow the stair path and signs up to the Golden Gate Bridge Plaza.\n\nDirections to Fort Point:\nFollow Marina Blvd along the shoreline and through Crissy Field, or follow the main road and the Presidio Promenade along Lincoln Blvd, take Long Ave all the way down to the fort.\n\nTips:\n* Tours and cannon-loading demonstration are offered Friday to Sunday, 10am to 5pm;\n* Maintained restrooms are available outside;\n* Dogs are allowed on leash on Fort Point lands (but not inside the actual fort);\n* Between March and October, you'll likely spot migrating whales and seal pups (and surfers year-round);\n* Bring sufficient outerwear - it's windy down here & fog is present during summer months / winter days, eventually burning off by noon, only to return again in the evening. \n\nPro-Tip:\n* Don't forget to high five Hopper's Hands!\n\nHave you noticed numerous joggers putting their hands against the chain-link fence at the farthest end of Fort Point and wondered why? \n\nThere's a small inspirational placard mounted next to the \"No Trespassing\" sign where the sidewalk ends. \n\nThe current placard is painted black & orange in honor of the SF Giants. Ken Hopper is a Golden Gate Bridge ironworker who's been called to rescue over 30 bridge jumpers in the last 32 years. \"Hoppers Hands\" is a life-sized tracing of Ken own hands.\n\nBelow the sign, a few feet off the ground, is a smaller placard, with a pair of doggy paw prints for your four-legged friend to join in on the tradition.\n\nSo whatcha waiting for?

A classic example of early 19th century coastal fortifications, it was used to defend the SF harbor against invasion by foreign powers. In the 1930s engineers used it as their HQ when building the GGB and in 1970 Congress made Fort Pointe a National Historic Site.\n\nIt was really easy to find, they have free parking, and apparently people also perform Shakespeare plays here.

I really felt I was stepping back into history, and as I walked around the interior. I wondered if my California ancestors who fought in the Civil War ever walked where I was walking.  Looking up, it is interesting to see the art of the master brick masonry from the Civil War period framed by the underside of the Art Deco Golden Gate Bridge that opened in 1937.\n\nI was disappointed that when I went the upper floors of the fort were closed for railing repairs; I had visualized an interior photo.

Fort Point is gorgeous; originally one of the towers of the bridge was going to be here, but after the architect saw it in person he redesigned the bridge to save the fort. \n\nOther cool things about the Fort Point:\n\n1) It is a civil war fort. Take a minute and think about how crazy that is.\n2) Each brick was made on site specifically for the fort. Take a look at some of the arches and you will see some incredible work. Beautiful.\n3) The BEST place in all of the city to watch the blue angels; they fly right over you (but you need to climb to the top of the fort, what is wrong with all you people that just stay in the parking lot?!). Actually, you know what, never mind. You didn't read that. I prefer having that secret to myself. Crissy Field is the best place, I'm sure. Go there. \n4) There are daytime and candlelight tours here, and a cannon loading demonstration for the kids (No, they don't actually fire the cannon, but it's still fun, and they can get a certificate for assisting).\n5) It is a great spot to take pictures. On top right under the bridge, near the gorgeous arches, in the doorways of where the rows of rooms are (there are no doors and you can get some great pictures of people peeking out from the different rooms along the way), on the large stone stairs (each step weighs 1,000 pounds!). \n6) Yes, a scene from Vertigo was filmed here. But of all the things that make this place cool I think it ranks towards the bottom.\n\nOther things to know: It is cold and windy no matter the day. Hopefully you know the city well enough to expect that, but if not bring a jacket for pete's sake! \nIt's FREE. There is a donation box at the front, but the fort is free to enter and explore. AND the tours are all free! Even the candlelight one, you just have to make a reservation. \nRight now it is only open Friday through Sunday, 10am-5pm. \n\nBasically, if you haven't been here yet you need to fix that ASAP because you are missing out. I think you can tell from my review that I have been on multiple tours; they are 100% worth it. And I'm saying that as someone that does not usually enjoy tours.", "author": "Kari E."}

Heck, I've even taken a few photos in front of this place as a kid and even as a teenager.  It wasn't until one of my more recent trips where I got to venture inside to see what it was all about.  I didn't even know this place could be toured!\n\nMy uncle decided to drop off my two gal friends and I here while he ran some errands.  I don't think he anticipated how nerdy we can get because we took quite a long tour of this place and soaked up all the rich history.   Fort Point was built during the American Civil War.  Starting construction in 1853 at the height of the Gold Rush and finishing in 1861, Fort Point was mastered to protect San Francisco but was never once actually used in any sort of battle.  Inside this massive architecture is a maze of windy shallow stairs, canons, rooms with giant informative posters behind pixie glass, and the most amazing views on the rooftops.  \n\nWe also got a weird cheap thrill here [not that kind, pervs!].  None of us had research this place since we didn't even know the name of this fort until we got here.  This place is kinda chilling!  I swear we all entered this room together but the three of us all got split up.  I was reading about women's role in the Fort and I thought my friend was next to me.  All three of us had the same experience but in different rooms of the base.  It was weird and it took fifteen minutes to locate everyone.  Cell phone reception was bad here, okay?  :P\n\nAnyways, Fort Point is a cool place to visit and it's definitely an interesting place to soak up some history for free.

Fortunately, we took notice, and entered the fort's interior for a modest donation.\n\nWe were immediately paid back with fascinating views of the underbelly of the Golden Gate Bridge. After climbing three flights of steps to the top of the fort, we encircled its paint-splattered parapet. The superstructure of the bridge soared above and the fort's courtyard and arched fortifications lay below.\n\nDescending a granite spiral staircase, we meandered through the impenetrable red brick fortress, and peered out of its rusted iron casements. The enlightening museum revealed that Fort Point was the only brick artillery fort ever built on the west coast.\n\nIronically, the fort itself had to be defended from destruction, during the building of the Golden Gate Bridge. Chief bridge engineer Joseph Strauss saved it, as \"a fine example of the mason's art\", by designing a special arch to straddle the fort.  \n\nToday, Fort Point survives as one of the finest Civil War Period masonry structures in America, and endures as a lookout post in the shadow of the most famous bridge in the world.", "author": "Joe R."}

The Golden Gate Bridge in all its glory.\n\nI have never been so close to the Golden Gate Bridge besides driving across it. When walking across this bridge, even with that, you truly can't appreciate the architecture and design of the bridge as much as you would if you visited Fort Point.\n\nFort Point was constructed during the American Civil War in 1853 and finished in 1861. Its architecture was the only one of this nature that was built West of the Mississippi during this time. It was originally meant to protect the San Francisco bay during the height of the Gold Rush and even though its cannons never fired a single shot for war, it still served as an important military base. \n\nThese days, it is recognized for its rich history. On October 16, 1970, Fort Point became a National Historic Site. \n\nThere's a museum open to the public in which it showcases the many different uses that the fort has had over the years. \n\nPersonally, I think it's a great area to visit.

The wedding itself may or may not be but the act of standing before God and everyone and vowing to stay with someone through poverty and ill health is filled with gravitas.  At 16 I broke up with a boyfriend who stood at my bedroom window proclaiming that he'd have asked me to marry him had I been two years older.  Then, when I finally got a marriage proposal (different guy) it happened in a crosswalk in Calistoga.  Not on bent knee either.  We were walking across the street.  So that moment was not weighty nor did it reflect the seriousness of the journey I was being asked to embark upon.  Don't let your marriage proposal be like this.  \n\nA good marriage proposal, in my opinion, should be big and bold and make a statement about the life that you envision spending together; the only life I'm certain you get.  It should reflect that this is a huge journey you're asking someone to join you in.  Plan accordingly.  \n\nWhat's this have to do with Fort Point, you ask?  It is atop Fort Point, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, that there exists what I believe to be the perfect location for a marriage proposal.  With the bay on one side, the ocean on another, the huge bridge looming, the salty air, and the city in the background you have every potential metaphor for the act of marriage available to each of your senses.  Get creative.  Indulge.  There's no wrong answers.  \n\nAnd then, assuming children come later you can return to Fort Point with a story to tell.  Your children, especially if they're boys, will appreciate the opportunity to run around here.  Up steep stairways through multiple floors.  Down long, narrow, hidden hallways.  Had I taken my boys here when they were younger they'd have thought this the perfect location for hide and seek or tag though the latter might not be appreciated much by others or by the Park Service who oversees the whole thing.  \n\nEntrance to the fort is free as is nearby parking right on the water's edge.  If you want to make it more of a journey, you can hike in from many different directions (Golden Gate Bridge, Crissy Field, Presidio).  Dogs aren't allowed and neither is food or drink though I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to sneak in a split of champagne.  Go big or go home.  \n\nFort Point also has a lot of historical information at hand as well as cannons and powder kegs.  For me though, it's all about that rooftop.

My advice is to park further away and walk along the rocks towards the fort. During your walk, take in the fresh air and breeze from the SF Bay. \n\nWalk through the entrance, stand in the middle of the hall and slowly do a 360. The grandeur of the hall is truly breathtaking. Once you've taken all that in, walk through each floor. Unlike others, don't rush through and climb to the top. Each floor has its own secrets - officers quarters, spiral staircases, secret corners, almost hidden windows with compartment views of the bay & bridge. \n\nAfter exploring, finally go to the roof and breathe. Here, you are up close and personal with the bridge. Walk under it, take some photos, get creative. Don't get too distracted by the bridge, albeit beautiful.

And of course, the Presidio consumes a sizable amount of SF real estate. I guess this shouldn't surprise me since the playground for the tie-dye generation was on Haight (sounds like hate) Street.\n\nRegardless, Fort Point is perhaps the BEST TOURIST ATTRACTION IN THE BAY AREA and it probably doesn't even make the top 10 in tourist attendance even though there is free parking and free admission. I've only seen one other old fort that can compare - Fort Pulaski in Georgia. Although Pulaski was located on an island facing the Atlantic with cannonball damage and an alligator moat with drawbridge, Pulaski's incredible views don't include spectacular underneath angles of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nTo top it all off, there were art exhibits throughout the Fort as part of the 75th anniversary celebration of the Golden Gate Bridge. It made for a very complete 1 hour and 15 minute outing.\n\nI have one more point (pun intended) to make about the Golden Gate Bridge. San Franciscan's have a weird idea of what looks golden. The bridge is painted orange-red like they are Texas Longhorn fans. The waterway is constantly dreary and foggy - not sunlit with the golden Californian sun.", "author": "Brian U."}

Be sure to also check out the Presideo, Coastal Batteries, National Cemetery.\n\nThis is a great place to get lower shots of the Golden Gate.  Its lit up very nicely in the morning if it clear or you can get a nice silhouette shot at sunset at the end of the day but morning to Noon time is better light from that side.\n\nAlso very popular and a good place to go running, biking, walking, picnicking, etc.", "author": "Damon D."}

I could've come here when I was kid, I don't know, I don't remember- we used to go crabbing years ago but I couldn't tell you where. We went here on our most recent trip to the Bay Area (april/may 2010). Closed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. According to the website, open Fri- Sun 1-am to 5 pm. Historical site during the Civil War; the Presidio was once an active military base.\n\nSuper windy and coldy even on a sunny day, bring a sweater or jacket. There were quite a bit of people fishing. There are public restrooms (open front door) but no mirror, so check your face in your compact. Fun place to walk around and take pictures with the beautiful Golden Gate Bridge in the background- it's iconic. Lots of people walking, and biking (tourists- these bikes had maps affixed to the handle bars- saw them all over the city). Lots of dogs, too. Family-friendly.\n\nI guess one could have a picnic here if you didn't mind the cold wind. And it would probably help if the food was cold too.\n\nThere was a ton of construction in the area so some roads were closed off. Parking was not a problem. There were many others in the area.", "author": "Margret C."}

Staring out at the never ending horizon right underneath the bridge is too romantic. Lookout for the heavy gusts of winds if you're a hat wearer. If you bring your kids keep a close eye on them because the steep stairs have no railing. On the rooftop you can also easily climb the wall and die. Some people were doing this, they had to be gigantic idiots.\n\nThroughout the three or four floors of Fort Point there are some rooms showcasing photos, artifacts, and models illustrating its historical past. When I went there was also an exhibition of artwork reflecting on the Golden Gate bridge, yet I hardly found any pieces. If you want to truly experience the Golden Gate Bridge you should come here.

So here I go with my 3000th review dedicated to a beautiful spot in a city that I have yet to fall out of love with.............\n\nWe had time to kill before embarking on to dinner and the sun was shining, the breezes were blowing and it was a clear day, so clear you could see Coit Tower, Alcatraz and of course, the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nI'd been to various parts of the bay where a glimpse of the GG Bridge stands majestically whether it was a day such as this, or one which was laden with fog. Today, the clear blue skies were the perfect backdrop for the bridge -- not a cloud in sight.\n\nIt was the first time I'd visited Fort Point -- didn't even know it was there -- and from that angle, the GG looked even grander than before. It's not called Fort Point for nothing because there really is a fort -- well, one left over from the Civil War, or whatever the remnants of it remains. Windy staircases intrigued all the little children there when they reached each level and found eerie corridors and cavernous corners in which to run around in. \n\nWhen you get to the top, there is a 'lighthouse' looking thing and several signs reminding you to stay off the walls. The winds are brutal up here! The sunshine does nothing to stave off the freezing cold of the gusts pounding into you, but somehow, you relent because the sight is quite magnificent.\n\nI was mesmerized again by how beautiful San Francisco is, and how sad that I no longer live in this gorgeous city by the bay!!", "author": "Anita L."}

Awesome spot to sit down and take pictures. I was considering coming here to take engagement photos. It's so beautiful (if you like that rusty look).\n\nIf you take Mason St. all the way towards Golden Gate Bridge from the Marina, you'll find free parking at the very end. From there, it's like a 5 min walk. I don't know where to go to park closer.

Plus I didn't have a jacket and I was freezing up there at the top of the Fort.

I would highly recommend this as a must see! They have a gift shop as well, I think it was on the first floor so no stairs to get to it. We parked for free in the lot by the Fort. Also I think Yelp has their hours of operation wrong as the sign I saw said: Fort Point is open Friday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. So I would check their website just to be sure they're open for your visit.

Sure, just as long as you say \"San Francisco\" and not \"Frisco\". \n\nYou could get your ass kicked for doing that around here. Forget being an OT (out-of-towner) surfing their local spot, don't you EVER say \"Frisco!\" \n\nWhen the Federal armies built this fort (http://www.nps.gov/arc...) to protect the City from marauding Confederate warships, they didn't know that they'd be creating a very unique ocean wonder, a respectable surfing spot directly beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. While the fort never had to repel any attacks (a futile feudal fort, hehe, I crack myself up), the base is battered every day by relentless tides and waves that surfers cherish. Now administered by the National Park Service, it's open to the public and the buildings are boring, yet the location is...magnificent! But, enough of the war stuff, my review concerns what I think of whenever Fort Point is mentioned and it's not brick and mortar walls or gun emplacements. If you're more interested in the killing stuff, move on to another review...this is about the thrilling stuff...\n\nA small parking area just in front of the break offers an extremely easy entry into the churning cold pacific and, as always, timing the swells critical unless you want to be peeling yourself off the rocks and looking for the broken pieces of your board. But compared to paddling out in overhead North Ocean Beach, it's easy.\n\nBesides North Beach and a couple other lesser known surf spots, my brother and I would get wet here whenever we'd meet up in the City for our birthdays (we're twins). Describing the feeling of being with a favorite family member, sitting on a board between sets right under the GGB is impossible to describe. There's a surfer saying \"Only a surfer knows the feeling\" that, while sounding somewhat trite and disingenuous, is 100% spot-on. As you sit idly waiting for a wave, the swells rise and fall beneath you, the ocean cold and dark and on a foggy morning, you can feel completely isolated right here in the City. Paddling back out after a ride, you are overwhelmed by the massive concrete and steel legs of the bridge where fog often hides the upper structures from view. Sometimes the fog is so thick, you can't even see the surfer right next to you. Disembodied voices are heard \"Hey, do you know where we are?\" \"No way, but I think I hear rocks.\" comes a reply. \"Hey, have you seen my brother?\"Sure sis,I'm right here!\"  I'd been sitting right next to my brother! Time for a crab sammie down on the wharf. One more wave first though. This is Fort Point.\n\nAre you interested in a morbid anecdote? Sure you are. I know what you want.\n\nFog can play major tricks on the mind, especially when you're alone. We'd be in the dark wild ocean where sharks live and feed. Big sharks...think Jaws (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvCI-gNK_y4). Now and then, when visibility was near zero and it was eerily quiet, we'd hear a loud splash. \"WTF was that?\" It could've been a seal jumping off a rock or it could've been a big great white chasing something, something also big, it might even have been a whale breeching. But we're here, under the famous Golden Gate Bridge and the first thing we'd guess is...\"Jumper?\"  It happens all the time... http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=ggb%20suicides&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tollroadsnews.com%2Fnode%2F1678&ei=snzAUaimDYrwiwLG3oC4DQ&usg=AFQjCNGbtgbAscvfgTZBf1LVCEAMev0cOQ&sig2=DeOmPW3TbttUYLH3p4VkBA&bvm=bv.47883778,d.cGE \"Once every 18 days\".\n\nFt. Point is a historical site of a time of war and fear.

It was even designed to favor the entrenched defenders when the fighting became hand to hand and bayonets and swords were being employed. \n\nThis was back when the manual of arms all revolved around training and drilling the soldiers to use to use their right hands. Even if an individual was a Southpaw, he was expected to handle his arms with his right hand.\n\nTo give us a better feel for the day to day living conditions of the Union troops who were garrisoned here, after a day of seeing the sights and hearing the narrative of it's history, we had dinner in the very same mess hall that the fort's soldiers used over a century ago. \n\nWe also spent the better part of the evening singing the various Civil War songs that we had learned in previous weeks. To this day, my favorite Civil War song is still the Southron version of _Battle Cry of Freedom_.\n\n\nAnother thing the teachers required of us during this trip was that we had to take turns getting up in the middle of the night and performing several hours of  sentry duties with our team mates which entailed walking rounds along the circumference of the fort's uppermost tiers.\n\nWe were armed with replica period rifles and given passwords to challenge any nearby patrols to be sure they were friendlies.\n\nThis night time patrol was made a bit more unsettling by some ghost stories/legends (particular to the Fort's past)the rangers had told us during a hike earlier in the night.\n\nMy only souvenir from this trip was a miniature brass cannon which I bought from the park's shop which now sits in a display case at my dad's house.", "author": "Temujin B."}

Interpretive signs showed us how the old network of forts could defend the Bay with deadly gunfire, although it was never needed.  \n\nThe outside walls were all gun mounts, and the inside wall was the barracks and magazine.  We were able to walk around inside the interior ordinance storage rooms and the living areas.  The stone circular stairways reminded me of European castles.  The old lighthouse on top reminded me of the multiple uses the Fort has had over the years.  \n\nReconstruction was in progress, showing us how the military personnel lived while they were on tour here.

Thank god for curious aunts, that's all I can say. \nAfter a long, lingering lunch at Greens, the two of us walked along the Marina, and my aunt said, \"What is that building under the bridge?' To which I responded, \"There is no building under the bridge. You must be thinking of someplace else.\" \nWe quibbled over the finer points of this argument for a good ten minutes, then decided to go check out the fictional building for ourselves. We had no idea how to get there, so just kept driving west, past Crissy Field. \nTen minutes later and no building in sight, I was soooo ready to say \"Ha, told you so!\". That's when we saw the sign for Fort Point. And when we finally got out of the car, I was in awe. Does a better vista exist? I don't know it. \nAfter I stopped gaping long enough to talk, we decided to explore the fort. A quick jog up three flights put us right under the Golden Gate bridge. Right then, with the wind whipping through my hair, staring out at the bay and up at the soaring beams of the bridge, I knew why I live in San Francisco. This is a city with no equal.", "author": "Purnima M."}

While the civil war was being fought mainly on the east coast, the Union thought it necessary to build a fort in San Francisco.  Very interesting.  The view is beautiful, and despite the corrosive salty seaspray, the fort is in very good condition.  I would recommend taking kids here for a little history lesson, or just to take a look around if you're giving out of towners a tour of the Golden Gate Bridge.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-05", "description": "Oh, hello there. Looking for an awesome review about Fort Point? Well, you've stumbled across the right one! But before we begin, I'd just like to point out that my review may be a teeny-tiny bit biased because I uh...well, I work at Fort Point. I'd also like to slap a disclaimer on here to let my fellow yelpers know that the views and opinions expressed in this review are solely that of Tevina's and do not reflect the National Parks Service nor the Golden Gate National Rec. Area nor the Department of the Interior  in anyway. Tevina is a park ranger by day, and crazy, cackling yelper by night - it is indeed night time right now, so prepare for some crazy. \n\nGreat, now that -that's- out of the way, let us begin. Fort Point is the place to be whether you're looking for a low energy, but exciting activity for your 'out of towner' friends, or just a cool stroll on a hot day (it's seriously like ten degrees lower inside the fort than right outside. I'm not kidding). The view of the GG bridge is breathtaking, the rich history and architectural work is astounding. \n\nBut what is there to do at this old brick fort? Well, there are tours twice a day, as well as cannon drill demonstrations. No, we don't actually shoot the cannons, but we engage the audience by letting them participate in the drills and feel free to throw your arms in the air and yell \"BOOOOOOOM\" in the hallways after the person pulls the primer from the cannon vent. Oh, and did I mention you get to do the drill with an AUTHENTIC 12-pounder Napoleon cannon from the civil war era? HOW COOL IS THAT!?\n\nAnyway, if interactive and walking around isn't your kinda thing, there are videos that are shown every day that are played inside our tiny theater which is the perfect escape from the cold and wind outside because in order to go into the theater, you have to go to the bookstore. The bookstore, oh god, I love that place. Imagine if you were climbing Mt. Everest and all of a sudden you see a cabin with a fire place brewing and hot cocoa being served in the middle of it all; see now the bookstore in the fort, it's like that. \n\nThe best part of visiting Fort Point is the admission. It's absolutely FREE! All the programs (the tours, the demonstrations, the videos, the exhibits) are FREE! Come in for 5 minutes, stroll around for 2 hours or even spend the whole day there! It's absolutely free to get in. But one important thing I must mention is that the fort closes promptly at 5pm. The upper tiers close 10 minutes beforehand, so if you arrive at say, 4:52 we can't let you up there. Even if you came all the way from Kazakhstan and it's your last day in the bay area and you just want to go up to the roof for 1.5 minutes; you can't go up. Why? Because we're closing. And I want to go home so I can eat and drive all the way across the city to make it in time for my evening class. Feel me? Oh, and we don't take bribes either. So don't offer me $20 to sneak you up there. Come between 10am - 450pm and it'll all be gravy, baby.", "author": "Tevina T."}

The surf there can get good, but it is rather sketchy, clearly.  The vibe is not great.  Most surfer there are good people and are cool if you are respectful and patient...but others are downright salty if they don't know you.  \nI was there one evening,  and the sun was going down. there was only 2 people in the water, and out of nowhere a mass of birds started feeding on the surface near by.  Being in the water became downright creepy.  Not much scares me more than seeing birds feeding on the surface when I am surfing... The surf was pleasant that day, and there was 2 people out, great right?  We all looked at each other...b/c of the bird action, and they rode the next waves in... I simply went in as fast as I could.  It's is a eerie place for me, but from a tourist perspective I think it is fascinating... Very cool.  I don't make the time to go there enough... The perspectives are quite impressive.", "author": "gordon w."}

You can watch ships as they enter the bay, watch the sail boats and various wind surfers as they cross the choppy waters or just hold on to a loved one and enjoy the atmosphere.  This is also the famed location from Hitchcock's masterpiece \"Vertigo\" when Kim Novak jumps into the bay and James Stewart saves her from drowning.

There aren't a lot of other places where you can easily see the Golden Gate Bridge from below. I think they still do their docent tours here. I remember doing that many years ago. You can watch people fish and oftentimes there are surfers there too (looks dangerous with all those rocks!). You used to be able to sneak around the Fort on the far side, but they fenced that off some years ago. You used to be able to get almost to the other side to a spot where you could see the open ocean. I guess they decided to limit access because it gets dangerous when the waves are strong and for security reasons too. I would very much recommend Fort Point as a quick stop if you're taking in the sights nearby.

Free parking, free entrance (donation requested, but still...), not crowded even on a sunny summer Sunday afternoon, and the most awe inspiring views of the bridge, the bay, the city.  I'm still swooning the next day. Our family was looking for a super cheap, but fun, way to celebrate a belated Father's Day, and did we ever find it for the cost of a tank of gas.
