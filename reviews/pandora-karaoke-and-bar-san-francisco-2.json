When it arrived, they said we couldn't take it down because it was in boxes (I don't know what else delivered food would come in). \n\nWe had ordered finger food intentionally to make it easy on everyone - I had to walk to a corner store to buy plates and tin foil, unload all of our food (wings, fries, everything) in the doorway where the guy checks ID's and take it one plate at a time, down through the bar to the room. (Of course all of this takes forever and we're paying by the hour)\n\nThey would not let me take the food down, plate it, and bring the boxes back up. It was like they were incapable of logic.

I walked in the shortest direction possible from Powell BART along Eddy and even for those 2 short blocks I was sketched out. My tip is to come and leave in a group so you feel safer. Most of the people you walk by are probably harmless but better safe than sorry.\n\nThe inside itself is actually really nice and a pretty startling contrast to the world outside. When I went last Wed, there were two groups in the main karaoke room (~10 people in each group) so it wasn't that crowded.\n\nMy coworker who made the reservation for the large room had it booked from 7-10. I've been to my fair share of private karaoke spots, but I was shocked by how big the large room was. There were around 15-20 of us and it could have easily fit more. \n\nThere were plenty of TVs spread throughout the room so no matter where you were sitting or standing, there was always a TV within your line of vision. There was a lot of space in the middle of the room so most of the time people were standing in the middle as they sang and danced.\n\nThere was only one big screen you could order from in the large room, so it was a bit annoying to have to physically get up to order your next song. I'm used to using iPads or other small handheld devices to look up and put in songs.\n\nSong selection seemed decent, but it was hard to tell because there were so many people there that I didn't get a chance to put in that many songs. Also I can't speak to the availability of Asian songs since I was with my coworkers and we were singing all English songs, but since it looks like Pandora uses a Chinese karaoke system, I'm guessing their Chinese song selection should be pretty good.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time there, but subtracting a star for the sketchy location and another for the price (which seems pricey?).", "author": "Dianna H."}

Well, it's one of the few karaoke joints in San Francisco where you can rent a large private room that accommodates 25 people for a reasonable price!  And the service was friendly, attentive, and laid-back...that goes a long way at a karaoke bar, as far as I'm concerned!\n\nAs I mentioned, this karaoke bar is 100% NOT WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE!!  There is a huge, steep flight of stairs to get down to the lounge, and there is no elevator.  So, the fact that there's a roomy, spacious accessible bathroom doesn't make a lick of difference, unless someone carries you down the stairs or you can make it on your own.\n\nThe main lounge is pretty large, with multiple sitting areas and comfortable seating.  The bar is very long and looks a bit weathered.  The lounge in general feels a bit rundown, but you're in the Tenderloin, so that's kind of to be expected.  The sound is very loud and not really very good quality, and the singers are often drowned out by the background music.  I was here on a Saturday night, and by midnight, there were only three people there, taking turns singing...I was surprised that they were so empty!\n\nWe rented the large private room with the stripper poles in it (after all, you never know if your friends will want to provide entertainment while you sing!).  It was spacious, comfy, very dark, and incredibly loud!!  Our singing was totally drowned out by the background music, so it was really hard to hear one's self sing.  The song selection machine was very difficult to use, and we kept having to switch it back from Chinese language!  The song selection itself was EXTREMELY limited and mostly modern pop songs, which is great if you live for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber, but my crowd is well past the age demographic for these types of artists.  The main room has a MUCH larger song selection, but that's not accessible in the private rooms.  This felt pretty limiting for us.\n\nOverall, this place feels like a dive bar, and in a lot of ways, that's exactly what it is...but if it weren't for that huge flight of stairs, I'd definitely come back here again to sing in the main room!

It's also conveniently near the bar so it's easy to order drinks and bring it to your room.  \n\nAs for the entertainment experience, they have upgraded their song selection process.  They have iPads now and the videos are all real...official videos.  No more generic nature scenes or random people holding hands walking down the beach.  Of course, there are some songs with no videos but at least the lyrics seem very accurate or more accurate than before.  \n\nI booked my room at 6pm-9pm.  Word of warning, the room is 3 hours minimum so I can not stress how important it is to get there on time.  Usually someone has the room reserved at 9:30 so if you get late you end up paying more for time that you don't spend in there.  Since I didn't check until after 6pm, we ended up paying for time past 9pm despite us vacating the room at 9pm.  No bueno but again, my fault for getting there late.\n\nIf you go to the bar to order drinks, it's $20 minimum for credit card orders.  So if you close out your tab, make sure it's $20 worth of booze.  If you're a lightweight, then buy one for your friend or good looking stranger or a good singer who performed an entertaining song in the lounge.  Anyways, it's $20 or bring cash if you are one of those paranoid people who don't like leaving your tab open in bars.\n\nOtherwise, fun place to go and I definitely will be back next year.

They both suck equally hard, for different reasons.\n\nThe private half is almost ruined by its user interface alone.  Looking up a song/artist is a cryptic process involving standing by the touchscreen in the corner of the room and making this long, super-specific sequence of button presses; get one detail wrong and you have to start all over.  Sometimes it just doesn't work, so you have to plow through the artists alphabetically -- about 100 pages' worth.\n\nBesides the issue of finding stuff, there ain't much to find.  If you're into, say, hip-hop, you'll find two songs by Jay-Zs and none by Eminem, Dre, Snoop, or Mix-A-Lot.  Not much luck with rock either, with a search turning up maybe 1/3rd of the hits from Green Day, Huey Lewis, or Queen.  Pandora's song files seem to come from the lower-end companies, so the music can be weird or the lyrics' timing off.  The TVs are mounted high, so expect to be craning your neck up the whole evening.  Then expect a mandatory 18% gratuity at the end.\n\nAs for Pandora's public half, they use different KJs on different nights, so your mileage may vary.  But the guy who runs the show on Fridays (a skinny black 30something guy) is one of the worst in the business.  He either doesn't know or doesn't care how to maintain a proper rotation, and obviously plays favorites.  He's got an attitude problem, too: ask him a simple question (i.e. \"I haven't sung in 2+ hours and I think you skipped me, can you tell me when I'll be on?\") and he'll scold you to not speak until spoken to -- and then not answer your question (or play your song).  No brains, no class, no competence.\n\nAlso, his selection is spotty, and half his song files are just cheap hackjobs with out-of-sync lyrics pasted on top of a bootlegged music video.\n\nOh, and one side-effect of having a KJ that doesn't care about anything is the type of singers it attracts.

I was told to grab a business card to email and I would get a response in 24 hours and that's untrue because no one ever responded. So I go back in to confront them the next day about not responding and the Asian chick who claimed to be the manager told me that \"oh, it must've been spam because they won't respond to spam\". I told her it wasn't sent as spam and that's an excuse. Never was the so-called manager apologetic but she just flat out didn't care. She wouldn't give me the name of her boss because she said it's privately owned and she's not allowed to. After all that, I still booked a room for 10 people. When I arrived to check in, the security up stairs (Terrence) made me take my hat off (I'm female) and he overly searched me again and again like I was some thug. When I got downstairs, I put my hat back on because my hair was crazy. Soon as I touched downstairs, the second security (Lance) rushed me and told me to take it off. I looked directly across the room to find a white gentleman wearing his hat in the middle of the main stage, I told security that I'm not taking my hat off until he does. The so-called manger chimed in and said that it's because my  hat a brink on it, though I think she meant brim but so did the other guy. I felt that I was singled out. As a female, I should be able to wear hats. Finally, we went into the room and the song selection is TRASH! They don't have all genres and it was just crappy to say the least. They had more Chinese songs in their catalog than anything. They don't serve food or don't offer drink specials. The staff kept barging in our room checking to see if we had outside alcohol even after that aggressive pat down, there's no privacy and they soiled the mood.

Pandora has a pluthera of private rooms, each decorated in a fun-filled theme (SF Giants, Henessey, Crown Royale, etc).  I reserved the Hello Kitty room for my girl's bday celebration.  Booked it way in advance since this room seems to be very popular with the chickies. \n\nIt was a Saturday night and the place was poppin!  The hostess led us into the HK room where it came alive with the gigantic Hello Kitty face hanging against the pink and white striped walls. But the minute we walked in, we were smacked in the face with an awful, pungent odor. HK room smell like....*ss! Ughh.The hostess assured us that the room was cleaned out but unfortunately, it left a sour, musty smell in the air (combination of bleach, throw up, and a stale wet mop). To minimize the stinch, she sprayed febreeze which did help a little....kinda. Once we got past the smell, we settled in.\n\nCouple of thing to point out:\n-Each room has a modern touch-screen karaoke machine.  It would have been convenient to have a list of songs so that the patrons can view what songs are available.\n-Our server wasn't very attentive.  There's a service button in the room but it took awhile for her to come check on us.\n-We ordered bottle service but they couldn't provide us with a pitcher of water? \n-the bathroom was untidy with no toilet paper or toilet covers. This isn't a club; it's a karaoke joint - I would expect the bathroom to be kept clean.\n\nOnce our 2 hour reservations were up, we hung out in the main room till closing which was filled with comfy lounge seats, the main bar, and enjoyed the live performance on a decent sized stage.\n\nOverall experience met our expectations but be prepared to shell out cash. Absolutely a great spot for big groups in celebrating special occasions.

Popular songs of 2014 & 2015 were not on their list. \n2. The computerized music catalog software is really old school. You can't alter pitch and you have to go up to the computer each time to add a song (no iPad or remote). There's no book in the rooms with the song options so your forced to huddle up at the computer screen. The menu of the software also defaults to Japanese...that's quite annoying having to change to English each time you add a song. \n3. The A/C is not strong enough. We, a party of 6, were in their standard size room at night and by the end of the 2nd song we were hot. I was sweating by the end of the 2 hour karaoke session. \n\nGood:\n1. The staff were really friendly and super helpful. They always checked-in on us to see if we needed anything. \n2. There is the option to go American karaoke (open mic in front of random strangers)....so you can go to this place alone or as a tourist and have lots of fun. \n3.

I called to our usual place but they were booked, so I looked into Pandora and tried calling them to book a room the night before for a group of 20.  \n\nTried is the key word.  I called six times over a 90 minute period and never once got someone to answer.  I live in the TL, so I said screw it, I'll just walk over and make the reservation in person.  That should have been my first warning.\n\nWe reserved the Maker's Mark room, which DEFINITELY doesn't accommodate for 20 people like they claimed.  The night we had reserved, we all get there and the room is staggeringly hot.  They had a small little fan unit the corner that was doing nothing to make the room feel okay.  Drinking helped a bit, dang.  To top it off, the machine that they have in that room is glitchy as hell, and had an awful selection.  It's hard to navigate first off. If you want to search by artist you have to first select language, then hit artist search, and then select language again?  And then once you try to search for those classic karaoke songs, or anything that has come out in the past five years, you either were faced with the file glitching and not playing (RIP us singing Don't Stop Believing...) or straight up found out they didn't have it.  Which is weird cause in the entrance someone was definitely shouting along to BBHMM by Rihanna, but when we searched on the Maker's Mark catalogue, they only had her hits from Loud and earlier.  For some artists they didn't even have any of their singles (Taylor Swift).  \n\nIt was just a rough night, and we made due and had a good time cause at the end of the day you're gonna have a good night with your friends and a couple of drinks, but I know I will not make the mistake of coming back here.  Or at least not to the Maker's Mark room.", "author": "Kristen T."}

Seating is plush and modern in the lounge, with some tables for your drinks. \n\nDrinks were okay.  Typical bar fare.  Watered down cocktails, but hey, it's $12 cocktails in TL.  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was happy with their music selection and acoustics THEN.  \n\nSo I booked something for September.  Well, there was a mix up in e-mails and they somehow still managed to have my name down incorrectly.  \n\nI made reservations for an out-of-state friend's visit.  We were in the Patron room (15 ppl. max) on Saturday.  $50/hour, plus 18% gratuity.    Unfortunately, the room is NOT well insulated from the lounge area.  It was super annoying.  We used the service button, and a few times, no one came.  Given that we were being charged an automatic 18% gratuity, one would think that they would have come in within a few minutes, and not 10 minutes later. Some of my friends just left the room and went to the bar instead. \n\nThe song selection is okay in the room, but the lounge area has much better selection.  The touchscreen menu really truly sucked.  We had a hell of a time trying to go through the pages.  I really prefer the binder of songs, opposed to this scrolling screen.   They offered some songs, and they did NOT work at all.  It was ridiculous! It was wasting time to have to scroll through everything to get one song that we wanted, and sometimes, the song wouldn't even work.  We were told to NOT use the book, as it would freeze the touchscreen menu, so we did not use the codes.  We did however look through the book to get better song ideas.  \n\nThe microphone needs a volume button.  The music is much louder than the mic, so sometimes it's hard to hear the singing. (Although, I suppose no one wants to hear off-key singing ever.)\n\nThe hostess tried to be accommodating but she couldn't do much about my complaints, as it was a busy Saturday evening.  (We had the 8:30 to 11 slot.)\n\nOverall, I will come back here if they upgrade/improve the touchscreen menu for the private room and have better insulation.

Tell your guest to drink before they get there so you don't get hit with a outside beverage fee. Cool variety of music just wish it was up to date.  Highly recommend this place for a birthday or ladies night out.", "author": "Tianna P."}

We had some great time bowling and parting on the party bus before we arrived at Pandora. It started with a big scary security at the door who was literally taking at least 5 mins looking at everyone's ID and then face, back and forth, back and forth making everyone else waiting. In spite of his \"hard\" work he missed that one of our people's ID was expired (which we learned at the next place where she had to show her passport instead to get in). Moreover he missed another guy of ours who was bringing through a bottle of alcohol inside which of course was completely wrong and unacceptable but that's what people do when they drink too much. Anyhow that bottle was discovered by some young chick working at the place later and she made sure that everyone who was standing next to the guy drinking out of bottle are pulled back to the security who apparently didn't do a great job in the beginning. We tried to ask for forgiveness and apologized but those people behaved like they get huge bonuses for \"catching\" \"bad\" guys. They didn't care to be nice to the rest of us. When we first made it downstairs after being \"scrutinized\" by the security no one of the girls cared to ask if we had a reservation or not. They were just passing by like it's none of their business to have 20 people standing and trying to figure out where to go next. 90% of their rooms were empty and they didn't care much to lose our group of 15+ people.

The fact that they have both an open lounge with bar set up + private rooms allows for flexibility within your group.  For instance, those in our group members that were not as enthusiastic as singing were able to head to the lounge area to chat, grab a drink, and enjoy the public serenade.  On the other hand, I was able to unleash my inner songstress in our comfy private room with a sick sound system.\n\n1.  Song selection: 5\nMany songs, many genres, many languages, many eras. If you want to sing, there is something for everyone.\n\n2.  Sound quality: 5\nProbably one of the karaoke sound systems in the city.  Well balanced, crystal clear, auditory bliss.\n\n3.

The only complaint that I'll add is that I couldn't find a list of the most recently added songs.\n\n4. Room condition: 5\nIf you're used to the shady karaoke rooms on Fillmore, let's just say that Pandora will look like a mansion!  Well outfitted rooms with enough floor plan to get up and dance.\n\n5.  Food and drink: N/A to my experience\nI didn't partake in any food and drink at Pandora, but others did and they seemed to enjoy it!\n\n6.  Service: 4\nI really appreciated the \"orientation\" for how to use the system and set up the room.  No other karaoke bar that I've been to does that - major props to Pandora.  My only gripe is that we barely got warning when they \"unplugged\" us for the night.  We weren't able to queue up Journey and Queen for the finale songs! :(\n\n7.

This is not like that. \n\nWe went here for a birthday party yesterday and rented a room. First the room that we had reserved was given to a completely different group. So instead of the room we ordered we got some \"Tiger\" beer room. Stupid theme, but whatever, let's sing right? The room was poorly ventilated, smelled like B.O., and then it got incredibly hot. The iPad was glitchy and would from time to time just wipe out our play list of songs that everyone was picking to sing. That happened 4 times. It felt like we were re-picking songs more than actually singing. Then many of the songs that we were picking would show up as a corrupted files so we couldn't sing those ones. The men's restroom was a level of pissy that I had not known existed. Even up to this point we are still having a good time. This is were it got crazy. \n\nWe had a Vaper in our group. They knew they weren't allowed to Vape in the room and didn't for a few hours. After a few drinks, they did take a few drags. Not cool, I get it, but what transpired after was uncalled for, unprofessional and criminal. \n\nA bouncer was sent to our room to kick us out over the vaping. He burst through the door hitting people with the door and forcing it open on unsuspecting people. He was ready to start some shit. He said we had to leave so we begin gathering our stuff and apparently we weren't doing it fast enough to his liking so he steps it up a notch. He grabs me by my shirt and pulls me out of the room. I'm still not mad. I look him in the eyes, and I asked him,\"why are you taking this situation up to this level?\" My question seemed to confuse his mind so he resorted to just talking shit. Called me a little bitch, a pussy, and that he was going to beat my ass. Mind you this bouncer is a 6'4 Tongan guy with about 75lbs+ more than me. Im not at all impressed by what he says to me, it doesn't phase me. I guess he expected a more of a \"bitch\" reaction and since he didn't get one, he grabs me for the second time now and starts forcefully walking me out. At this point my friend and girl friend are following us trying to figure out why this bouncer has his hands on me again. We get to the stairs to the exit, and my gf has had enough of his man handling of me and tries to get In-between us. He then grabs her and throws her down on the stairs! I go to pick her up and the manager then tells us she is calling the police, I think good we could really use them right now. Nope! She was calling the police on us! We get outside and the police arrive within a few minutes. I explain to them what happened and that I would like to press charges. The police tell me that the bouncer is saying he is scared for his life because we made death threats to him (wtf? Straight lie) and that he said if we just go our separate ways the bouncer won't press charges on me! My girl was physically assaulted by a simple bouncer who went beyond his athority and threw her to the ground because of a some vaping. Yeah, that person vaped and they shouldn't have done it, but what happened after was absolutely ridiculous .  The bouncer chose to get physical immediately and at the end put hands on a woman that didn't need that to happen to. This woman being slammed on the STAIRS you first walk down when you come in.The \"security guard\" was a prime example of when someone who has the mindset of a thug and is given to much power. He accused us of threatening his life, hilarious, considering he was 4x bigger than the woman he was pushing to the ground. How could a responsible business owner allow a situation like this happen on their property? How could they employ someone who is such a great liability? How can they expect a story like this not to get out? I am waiting for your response.", "author": "Joseph P."}

If so the website and business cards falsely advertised saying \"Happy Hour from 6pm - 9pm. Enjoy 50% off room rates and plenty of drink specials!\".

This reminds me of the beginning of High School Musical where people karaoke in front of everyone. The only karaoke places I have been to are where you have your own private room but this place has you sing on stage in front of everyone. This karaoke bar is obviously 21+ and it gets really busy as the night goes on. It is very difficult to find seats but seating is limited and usually it is taken over by big groups hanging out or celebrating. If you find a seat, grab it and never let them go! \n\nYou can watch and enjoy people have a great time as they sing their hearts out on stage or you can join them! There is a sign up sheet that is pretty long. My group kept contemplating whether to put their names down or not so by the time they put their name down and waited to be called up, it was already almost midnight and we had to catch bart. I would say it takes about 40 minutes from the time you put your name down until you can go on stage so be prepared for the wait. If you are shy and dont wanna sing, it is still a fun environment where you can dance to their performances or just have some drinks. The song selection is a bit older so they wont have the really recent songs. Maybe next time I will challenge myself to go up there and not be so self conscious. \n\n**TIPS**\n1) Even if you cant sing, you should go up there with a group of friends just to say you sang in front of a group. It seems really exhilarating and I gotta try it. A great group of friends will make this embarrassing moment a great fun one.\n2) Put your name and song down as soon as you enter because the list and wait gets super long.\n3) Enjoy!", "author": "Amy H."}

I thought drinks were reasonably priced and everyone was pretty happy with the selection. I also thought the song selection was fantastic. First of all, the song list is on an iPad and it was super easy to search for songs and add them to the playlist. Also, I loved the fact that a lot of the songs came with the original music video on top of the lyrics.

I ended up driving to pandora to make it in person. I don't get the no one answering calls thing, as no customers were at pandora but some employees. Well I get to scope the place out so it's all good. A nice place. Finally made the reservation. The Hennesey room is big and comfortably fit all my guests. We all had a great time. Music selection is a hot and miss. It seems like there was a lot more music options in the main stage than the private room! I don't get that at all. Same establishment, why couldn't you have the music in the private room that's playing in the lounge area? \n\nAll in all my guests and I still had a great time.the staff was nice and helpful. I would go back again and get another private room. If I can actually make a reservation that is..", "author": "Roger P."}

But I'm a fan of the classic karaoke venue which gives you a few books and a damn remote control.  \n\nI want to like this place.  I think this business has a great setup.  The themed private rooms are very creative and adds a nice touch for group gatherings.  The downfall of it all??  The damn karaoke system.  No one should be missing out on another person singing or a round of shots because they have to get up, walk over to the console and then meander through the menu which defaults to anything but English. I think Pandora's found a clever way to take your money while allowing you little time to actually sing. Half of the time (if not more) is spent heavily on figuring out their ridiculously confusing system.  Once you've figured it out and sung about 3 songs (I'm not exaggerating), you're back up and at it again.  Very few of the reservation time is spent singing. \n\n**You have to remember to select \"English\" each and every time you're up there surfing the catalog otherwise you better learn to read Korean real quick.", "author": "Nancy P."}

Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had booking an event venue.\nTo start with, it took them forever to get back to me when I emailed inquiring about a department event (this is because no one gets there before 6pm, when they open).  Once someone finally got back to me, I booked the room and prepared for my event.  The day before, a colleague and I walked down to Pandora (it's five blocks from our office) to see if they'd let us recon the room.  The bouncer at the door refused to let us in because we didn't have our IDs (citing CA law).  I asked if I could see the manager; after about 5 minutes, the girl in charge rushed us down the stairs and said she could let us look \"for a minute\".  She stood by the door the whole time and would hardly answer my questions.  I asked if we could arrive 30 minutes early to set up; no- for \"security\" reasons. (I'm starting to get annoyed now)  Finally, I asked her if we could bring a folding table for the food we were bringing in.  It was then she decided to inform me that I couldn't bring in outside food since they served food there and that it's not something they usually tell people unless they ask and I should've asked.  Uh, excuse me?  No honey.  your job is to tell you patrons all of your requirements FIRST.  I insisted she get in touch with the \"owner\" and let them know I was bringing in the over $200 worth of food and I would be willing to accept a fee.  Ended up paying an extra $50 for the food, but that was fine.\n\nNight of the party, I get there right at 6pm and open the door.  Bouncer says they're not open.  I tell him I have a 6pm reservation, so yes, they are open.  Then as my colleagues start helping me bring food in, he tries to stop me.  I told him I already paid an extra $50 to bring the food and table in; he had to go downstairs and verify.   No communication whatsoever between the front and back staff.  The bar staff was one person who was completely unaware of the ticket arrangement I had made with them and refused to accept the tickets from my staff at first (again, no communication).   Of course, since we were not allowed any extra time, I had to set up while people were coming in and someone else had to listen to the employee explain the system.  \n\nI will say that once everything was figured out, my team and I had a blast.  The room was big enough for everyone and there was excellent song selections.  However, the trouble I went through to get to that point was not worth me recommending this place or ever coming back...and of course, they charged us for the extra 15 minutes we spent cleaning up.

It's a quick walk from the Powell BART/MUNI station (the surrounding neighborhood can be a bit sketchy, so make sure you're not traveling solo), and they had an awesome Happy Hour that ran until 9pm. Not only did they kill the Happy Hour, they once told friends who showed on a Friday night that even to sing in the main room where the KJ was that you needed to have a reservation. Say what? I can understand that in private rooms, but not the main lounge. There was hardly anyone in there. \n\nThe breaking point was coming here for a friend's birthday. She had a private room reserved, but the manager who was supposed to have informed the others never did. Eventually we decided after waiting long enough that we would just go to the main room. We were offered the VIP area by way of ordering bottle service. Cash was collected and paid to the waitress directly when the bill came. They also had my friend's credit card on file because of the reservation for the private room. Not only did the waitress pocket the money for the bottle service as though someone were really going to give someone in a freaking Karaoke bar who brought out a bottle with ice and mixers a 200 dollar tip, they also charged my friend's card!  \n\nMy friend was drunk and didn't recall signing a receipt, so she ordered one from her credit card company, and the signature on the receipt looked nothing like her handwriting, drunk or sober. THE RECEIPT WAS FORGED! Without going to small claims court though, her credit card company was unwilling to step in on her behalf, so the waitress got a 200 dollar tip for walking about 20 feet from the bar to drop off a bucket of ice, some glasses, and a bottle of Jameson.\n\nOn another occasion a few months post-incident after already having a few drinks in the neighborhood, a bunch of my coworkers including said friend decided to go back to Pandora. I would have never made this decision sober. (Never underestimate the desire to regale an audience with Humpty Dance when inebriated.) My friend goes to the counter, and feeling courageous, tries to engage the manager in a completely civil manner about her forged credit card receipt when another female manager (presumably the one working the night the signature was forged) recognizes her and summons security to escort her out and tells her that she cannot return. We all left with her, vowing never to come back to Pandora. \n\nIf you go, and I don't recommend that you do, make sure you know that their well brands are absolute crap, never make an arrangement for a private room (the main room is so much more fun), never entertain an offer for bottle service, and above all NEVER let them have your credit card information.", "author": "Josh J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-25", "description": "Heed the warning: these guys will CHEAT you. I saw the reviews and cringed upon reading them but still decided to plan an event here. Bad idea.\n\nI threw a surprise birthday party for my soon-to-be husband and rented out the Hennessey Room which is their biggest (up to 35 guests) and most expensive room ($120/hour). Although everything worked out in the end (mainly because we are flexible people who will make the most of any situation), I would NOT throw another party here and would NOT recommend it to others without some major caveats.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Great concept. All the other karaoke spots in the city are practically dive bars. This venue got it right in terms of designing a variety of themed private rooms and creating an upscale lounge feel.\n- Main room. The karaoke system in the main public area works well. Unfortunately, it's probably the only karaoke machine in the entire place that works.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- They need a better reservation system. Everything seems so disorganized. I called during business hours one night to book my reservation and it was difficult to hear and discuss details with the loud music and singing in the background.\n- They don't serve food at the venue itself but supposedly you can order food through the waitress from The Chairman food truck. I told all my guests to eat beforehand so this wasn't an issue but, come to think of it, I didn't even see the food truck the night we were there.\n- The karaoke machines aren't the easiest to use. Nice idea with the touch screen technology but horrible execution on the software.\n- An hour into my reservation, we started using the karaoke machine and 30 minutes later it broke. They asked us to move to the main public area and said they would give me a nice discount - more on that later. It was a bummer since we didn't have our own private room to party in (which was the whole point of throwing the party here in the first place) but the KJ was accommodating though I'm sure it didn't hurt that we were giving him a bunch of $20 tips.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n- When I reserved the room, they asked for a $60 deposit which would be deducted from the final bill. I realized now, after the fact, that the deduction was never made. I just sent them an email about it...let's see if they get back to me. I'm not holding my breath but, if push comes to shove, at least I know I can dispute it with Amex.\n- I had a friend check in to the room on my behalf and the reservation was slated to start at 7:30pm. He got there a little earlier (7:25pm) and said he could wait until 7:30pm. Supposedly they said it wasn't a big deal since no one was using the room anyway but my start time on the bill said 7:15pm. Poor integrity and just plain petty on their part.\n- At the end of the night when it was time to settle the bill, I should have looked things over much more closely but I didn't because I was just trying to GTFO. I did check again the next day and realized that their \"discount\" was non-existent. I know that we only used the room for 2 hours maximum (including the time it took for us to clean up and move all of our things to the main public area) before the karaoke machine broke. I wasn't being dumb about it...I did actually check the time. On the bill, they charged for 3 hours and took off one hour. My issue is that we did NOT use the room for 3 hours and their \"discount\" was complete bullshit. I'm not mad about paying full price for the 2 hours but don't say that you're going to give me a discount if you're not and learn to take better accountability when shit goes wrong.\n\nTo sum it all up, I feel cheated by this place. I'm the type of person who doesn't mind paying full price for a good product/service but I can't help but feel like this place goes out of their way to squeeze every penny out of you at the expense of the customer experience. Based on other reviews, I'm not the only one who didn't get their deposit deducted from their bill. I mean, what type of business takes a deposit and conveniently forgets once their customer uses the service? Had everything gone smoothly, we would've easily spent 5+ hours renting out the room and I wouldn't have hesitated to get bottle service as well to keep the party going. Unfortunately, that was not the case.\n\nIf, for some reason, you still decide to come here (in spite of this scathing review), my advice is to stick to staying in the main area where the KJ is if you want to do real karaoke. If you rent a room, don't be surprised if the karaoke machine breaks down. On top of that, make sure to (1) keep track of your start and end time, (2) examine your bill closely (or have a good, sober friend look it over for you) at the end of the night and (3) have them deduct your deposit on the bill because they will surely forget.\n\n*Drop the mic* I'm out.", "author": "Novi M."}

Since we had about 15 people it came out to less than $10 a person. The rooms are very nice, and for the price during happy hour, it cannot be beat. There is also a great happy hour for drinks: a beer bucket of 6 beers for $20 and $3 well drinks from 6 pm to 9 pm. Needless to say we all had a nice (drunken) time singing our hearts out. At first we had a bit of trouble navigating the system to find the songs we wanted, but the staff there was incredibly nice and helpful and got us on our way for hours of singing and dancing.\n\nThe only downside, which turned out to be a huge downside for us, was that there wasn't much song selection.

Once you actually get into the place it is one of the best private karaoke spots in the bay area. But the fact that location needs to be mentioned just lets you know how much of an issue it can be. \n\nLocated in the heart of the TL if you know the area its actually not as bad as people proclaim it to be. Especially with the whole push for gentrification its probably safer than it has been in years but still if you are wandering around a 1am after getting out of this place it can be a dangerous venture. Grab your uber or lyft from inside and do go walking back to your hotel by yourself at this place. It seems odd to warn people about this but the number of tourist you see walking around drunk or with their wallets out at night as insane and it will be taken here so just a fair warning. \n\nOutside of its location which SF people have known about for years its worth the venture with a large group. The whole point of the place is to get a party together and sing your hearts out to each other in the comfort of your won room. Its best for any crowd from 3 to 20 and there are rooms of various sizes to fit your needs. I have been in rooms with only 5 people and rooms with up to 15 and they both were fun and not incredibly crowded. I have done the Heineken and Jameson rooms and both were fantastic. Most of the rooms are alcohol themed with discounts on drinks but there are also other themes like hello kitty and others. \nReally just depends on how much space you need and what your group is into. The rooms are charged different prices by size and how long you need the room for. The process is really simple and the Pandora staff if used to large parties and keeping them in line. Also with getting them in and out so if you do go over your allotted time you will be charged more so its up to you to keep track of how large your party gets. \n\nAfter you have ordered the room its time to show up and sing. They have an impressive selection of music with even some obscure hits and some have their own music videos while some are generic and look like fan made videos which are AWESOME. Sometimes you just end sitting back and watching the videos that have nothing to do with the music but tell an amazing story nonetheless. While you are singing the staff will bring your drinks to your room and you get discounts for ordering large quantities or buckets of drinks for the room. It really is a great deal for a large party just make sure you know who is paying because they aren't big on splitting so figure that out before you go. \n\nIf you aren't into the private rooms you can go to Pandora and sing on your own. When you enter from the street there is a main bar that serves all sorts of drinks and a smaller karaoke stage and TV. This area doesn't get too crowded so if you are on a date or with a friend or two and just want to sing a few songs this isn't too bad of a substitute. The sound isn't that great and it kind of has a depressing feel but with enough booze you won't care who is out there or if you are actually singing to anyone but yourself. \n\nOverall if you have a work party or birthday party and don't want to do the authentic karaoke in Japantown this is a fantastic alternative. Be mindful of the area and when you leave the karaoke rooms and otherwise you are guaranteed a good time.", "author": "Nick R."}

This was my second visit, although I'm a regular karaoke singer at other places and experienced using sound equipment.  \n\nI first visited Pandora in 2010 and it was a nice place with quality equipment.  Now it's still a nice place but the equipment is beat to death and even good singers sound bad...if you can hear them at all.\n\nYou can *barely* hear yourself sing on the main room stage because the speakers are pointing away from you from about 10 feet on either side of you when you sing.  If you're listening to someone sing it's likely the music is louder than their singing because the microphones are worn out pieces of junk in desperate need of replacement.  Turning the mic volume up won't help, the mic components are simply too beat up.  I sang three times and the mics had deadspots in several places so no matter how you turned them you couldn't get consistent sound.  Your best bet was to sing right into the top with it almost touching your lips, but let's face it, that's unsanitary no matter who you are.\n\nThe point is simply this.  Don't expect to hear yourself, sing well or hear other main-room singers decently (except those who yell-sing) until Pandora provides a monitor speaker for the stage and springs for new mics.  Until that happens, just skip it entirely.", "author": "Kevin D."}

There's a bright yellow Pyramid room, a purple and red Crown Royal room, even a friggin' HELLO KITTY ROOM. Yes.. you read that right, Hell-o Frickin' Kitteh!\n\nThe song list wasn't quite as extensive as I would have liked but I was super impressed that it was all digital and computer operated.

YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!\n\nWe used a Groupon here on a Monday or Tuesday night back in January of this year.  We were the only ones in a themed room that night, so keeping track of our order wasn't that hard, but we all felt the need to order directly at the bar anyway because, hellooooo, waiter, where did you go?\n\nWe got the Blue Moon Room, and it accommodated the small group well, but the music selection wasn't as diverse as I had hope.  For a place that charges by the hour, they sure don't help fill you in in a timely matter on HOW to use their equipment.  Most of the night was spent thumbing through pages and pages of Korean pop songs.  KID YOU NOT!\n\nBy the end of the night, as we were sealing the deal and letting bygones be bygones, billing became an issue, and the groupon, which was presented at both the beginning and the end of the night, was not credited.  It's a karaoke bar, people go there to get drunk and make fools of themselves, so I blame the management for not being responsible enough to apply the appropriate discounts to the bill as they should have.\n\nThough the bill wasn't paid out of my very own dollar ($250+), I'm still a HUGE ADVOCATE of superb customer service.  This is where it truly went downhill for Pandora....\n\nCalls were made at all times of the day after the night we went to \"make it right\", and get some kind of refund/credit approved by the management.  They knew they were wrong, and they didn't care to help out.  No return calls back.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Luckily, my contribution to the night, the gifted $50 groupon, was refunded to me through Groupon themselves.  Yay me!\n\nOh Pandora, do PAY ATTENTION TO THESE TWO LATEST REVIEWS!

Their reservation system gets an F grade.  The actual karaoke place is a B.\n\nThe process for making a reservation at Pandora is absolutely terrible.  I was compelled to go here because of a LivingSocial deal I purchased.  I sent an email one month ago that was never replied to.  When I called them, usually it went to a voicemail that was \"full\" and couldn't record my message.  When one call was finally answered, the person told me to reserve the room by sending an email.  Sigh!\n\nMy wife decided to help out and her email was actually responded to.  They asked for a credit card over email, which she gave.  However, they never replied to confirm our reservation.  On the day we wanted to go, we called them 3 times.  The 3rd call was finally answered by someone who told us nothing was confirmed.  This was the worst experience ever with making a reservation.\n\nWe came anyways, because they said there was still availability.  After such a poor experience with reservations, I was surprised the place was actually decent.  The lounge and bar area looked nice.  We ordered some steamed buns and they tasted good.\n\nWe stayed in the Crown Royal room for 3 hours.  The room was nice and comfortable.  One of the employees was very helpful in getting us set up and teaching us how to choose songs and control the music volume.  Unfortunately, the system for entering songs is not good.  Many other Yelp reviews say the same thing.  It takes too long to search for an artist/song and then add it to the queue.\n\nMy other issues with this place are the location and price.  As other reviews have mentioned, Pandora is in a bad neighborhood and you should be careful when walking there at night.  Also, Pandora rooms are much more expensive than other karaoke places I've been to in the South Bay.  They charge $50 per hour, but I've been to places for $15 per hour.\n\nIf they had a better reservation system, I would have given them 3 stars.  But it was terrible.  I honestly want to give Pandora a zero star rating, but Yelp's minimum is 1 star.", "author": "Chris S."}

I went to this place a couple of times with my friend who now goes karaoking alot. They have some really nice private rooms, but I've mostly spent my time in the main stage area. Nice bar, cool staff and bouncers. Drinks were moderately priced. I've been to this place like 3 times in 2012, and there's always different people and crowds. A few regulars here and there, and you get familiar with the KJs (Karaoke Jockeys). My favorite is Barryokie (who has a pretty large and diverse selection of music), and the guy before him. So far I've gone on a Friday and Saturday night. Beer buckets keeps the party going! They even have Happy Hour if you get there early.\n\nMy tip is to get to this place EARLY! (Like 8pm). Once it hits 9pm, the place gets packed and it will be a while to sing if you turn in a request slip. ALWAYS TIP YOUR KJ! You'll have a better chance of getting your song played, especially if you tip more. $1- tip is pretty standard. Street parking is both Easy/Hard to find. It's usually pretty full, but I've gotten lucky finding parking twice on Taylor st. Pandora is on 177 Eddy St between Taylor & Mason. I even got lucky finding parking on Mason aswell.

Love the bartenders.\n\nThe KJs are a bit more of a crapshoot. Almost every time I've gone, the KJ in the main room is a white guy with spiky N'Sync hair, and I never know what his attitude is going to be that night. Sometimes he's engaging--friendly and helpful when you request a song, supporting the enjoyment of the crowd between singers, and so on. Other times he acts like everyone is annoying and he wishes we would all go to hell.\n\nHe's okay most of the time, but he's not my favorite KJ ever. His particular policies are ones I don't like. He always lets people who have already sung multiple times sing again before giving a newcomer a chance. I realize that's a subjective thing, but I personally think it's better to let someone who hasn't sung yet do so before giving someone a third turn. He won't accept multiple song requests and space them out as he deems appropriate; you have to go back after you've sung. He (apparently) has no way to buy a song that isn't already in his catalog...or, at least, if he does, he's never told me. \n\nOnce he tried to charge me a kind of crazy amount to sing. I do often forget to tip him at the end of the night, so I don't really blame him for that one. A tip on tips: you can tip the KJ on your bar tab when you close it. Just add it to your tip and tell the bartender how much is for the KJ.\n\nI've had some really good evenings here on the good nights, though. \n\nThe private rooms are pretty fun! They all have themes that are pretty amusing, the food (Chairman's) is yummy, the table service reasonably priced, especially with a group. The karaoke system, however... The prior one wasn't originally designed in English and there's a number of tricks you'd have to learn to get results. Even after learning them, the transliteration from Korean or Japanese to English was often misspelled, meaning you still couldn't find songs that actually did exist in the catalog.\n\nOften the videos that accompanied the lyrics were...wow. Just...wow. The weirdest stuff ever. And sometimes the timing of the lyrics was so off as to make certain songs impossible to sing for most people.\n\nThey somewhat recently updated it, and at first it seemed better...instead of the cheesy old touchscreen, it was a simple interface on an iPad. It was in English by default. Stuff I could never find before came up. But...then, songs I'd finally figured out how to pull up on the old version, or always came up, didn't come up any more. And it was actually the same selection as far as I could tell...same weird videos.\n\nIt's important to note that the selection IS DIFFERENT between the private rooms and the main room. They're not the same system or selection! The main room has been more up to date as far as I can tell...maybe the new system will evolve.", "author": "Reese H."}

About 2 weeks ago when I emailed her, I initially requested the \"Blue Moon\" themed room for our party. She immediately got back to me and informed me it was already reserved and listed my other options. I emailed her back with a room choice just hours after receiving her reply, but she didn't respond to me until 4 days had past.\n\nBecause of the long wait, I ended up just calling the place and requesting a room through the phone. They let me know that my previous request that was listed in Kimmy's choices was now unavailable. They gave me two choices which was fine but It took awhile to actual try and book one of them because the woman on the phone was extremely rude.\n\nWhen Kimi got back to me, I told her about this and she was very understanding. She offered me the Hennessy room (the most expensive and largest private room they have) for one hour (even though there is a minimum of a 3 hour requirement) because of the troubles I experienced. So this part of Pandora went well and I was very thankful to have Kimi in contact.\n\nHowever, on the actual night of the event, we pulled up to Pandora and I immediately noticed that there were a lot of sketchy, homeless men scattered around the main entrance (there were also two bouncers there). I honestly would not have minded the sketchy atmosphere - I mean I grew up in Philly - but these men were aggressive. For example, later in the night one of them threw a cup of pee on an individual in my group as we were boarding the bus while also shouting at our group. \n\nSo, to make it short, the area in which Pandora is located in is not very good for groups or events.\n\nUpon entering, Kimi had told me that I would not experience any hassles at all and have immediate entrance. Unfortunately, that was not the case. A few women were being trained and the receptionist told me to hold on. I waited about ten to fifteen minutes and this made our room stay much shorter than I wanted it to be. When one of the women instructed me to go inside the room because she would instruct our group how to use the Karaoke device to choose an artist/song she was very passive aggressive and rude. She told just a few people, and left without helping like she had said she would.\n\nThe choices are programmed to be in Japanese instead of English and this was confusing to deal with slash a delay.\n\nThe room was not as nice as the website pictured, the bouncers were rude, and the help was very unreliable. I wish I had known these things before taking my group there, it was kind of embarrassing.\n\nAnyway, maybe you'll find it more appealing then me.", "author": "Natalie S."}

The brightness was killing the mood a little, but we couldn't figure out how to A) dim the lights or B) turn off only half the lights. *shrug*\n\nIt's my understanding that you must make a reservation here. We were booked from 9-10pm on a Friday, and had no issues staying an hour later. \n\nMachines are... terrible. Frustration in trying to type in the numbers, in using the menu, in attempting to browse through artists. We eventually got the hang of it, but those 10 minutes could have been spent belting out another 2 songs. Also, Asian songs, do they exist? Clearly there was an option on the machine, but trying to browse the artists on it was a headache. Very few non-English songs were listed in their songbooks. We eventually gave up searching.\n\nSpeaking of songbooks, they would have multiples of a song listed. They have poorly orchestrated instrumentals mixed with true karaoke using the artists' videos, and there is no way to tell which you were going to get. I recall an N'SYNC song being so bad I told the bf to just move onto the next song. Some of the song lyrics weren't sync'd well enough to the music. They get kudos for actually having a good selection of English songs, much more variety than a couple other places I've been in the past.\n\nDespite it being 'private' karaoke rooms, you should be prepared to have random people glancing in as they walk down the halls.

The karaoke rooms are spacious and well-stocked with TVs and up-to-date software and tunes.\n\nTwo (small) knocks:\n1)  To enter Pandora, you have to walk down a shady staircase, it's not entirely clear where you're going, and you get frisked before you can enter.

It was the most amazing night ever -- it superceeded my high school prom!\n\nThe decor all the way down to the electricity sockets was HK. There were HK pillows in the room, but I guess they were stolen. The karaoke machine was difficult to manuever when drinking, but pretty understandable -- in like 4 languages! The machines were touch screens and everyone that is lazy and NOT FUN complain about \"having to get up to choose a song...\" Blah blah blah. If you are with the right people in the HK room, having fun, there will be NO TIME TO SIT DOWN. This is HK for Christ's sake! The actual song lists were pretty limited, but I did not mind that so much. What better way to relive AWESOME songs like \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" or \"I Want It That Way.\"\n\nMy only objection to Pandora Lounge would be to fix the locks on the bathroom doors. I was happily peeing away, wiping, and pulling up my underwear and adjusting AND THEN A STRANGER WALKS IN ON ME.

I should have told everyone to make sure I didn't forget this basket.\nWe got a homerun deal which meant we got two hours of karaoke in a private room and a round of drinks for $75.

The search by song or artist feature (where you type in the name) didn't return all the possible songs, because if you scrolled through all the artists (sorted by popularity) you'd find them.\n\nAlso, when we arrived the guys in the party got a FULL pat down, TSA style, which I thought was super weird.

After reviewing their website I decided to celebrate my birthday here also. I started calling and emailing them in November 2013 to make a reservation for February 2014. After several attempts and no response I finally got someone on the phone. The guy took my name, number, date I was interested in, then told me that someone name Tod or Tom was the manager and would get back to me later that night. No one ever called me so I then called several more times to only get the answering machine which I left several other messages on.  Finally I called again weeks later and a lady answered saying she was the bar tender and rooms could only be reserved through the email address on their website, I explained to her that I had emailed that address several times and no one has gotten back to me, I went on to explain that my bday was quickly approaching which by this time it was 2 weekends away and I needed to make a reservation ASAP. She again told me I can only book through the website......so I had a friend send an email hoping she would get a reply AGAIN NOTHING!! Needless to say at this point I was irritated and made other plans! Here it is a month after my birthday no one ever called back or acknowledged my emails! \n\nI find this VERY VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL! \nI hope whoever runs this place reads this! \n\nHas anyone else had this problem when trying to book a reservation?

Walking in I was amazed at the atmosphere of the main room which was chill and aimed at bringing people together in an intimate surrounding. \n\nWe had to wait 15 minutes for a room to be ready, and they put us in the Pyramid room. The themes are CLEVER as someone reviewed and I hella liked how it was neat and modern. The only thing that was irritating were the kareoke machines. if you don't know what you want to sing, it is a time waster and it's basically costing you the time you should be singing. I hope they bring in song books to rectify that situation. Also, you have to press pretty hard to select something :(\n\nAt the rate of the room, it is a bit pricey but if you have a big enough party then you can have fun for a few dollars :) We had a party of 4, and I didn't sing because I was looking up the songs. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and the cute themes. \n\nThe employees could be a bit more animated to match the atmosphere (they didn't look like they were having any fun :P like they came just to work) since nothing in my mind stuck out about them except for that fact. \n\nAt the end of the night, we sung a total of 50 songs, drank a few beers, and partied hard. Security came in and was a bit assuming and rude but I guess they deal with a bunch of hardheads and drunks every night so I totally understand if that's the case. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for fun in the city, Pandora is a good place to go with a big group of friends and sing your heart out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-07-27", "description": "If there was negative stars, Pandora Karaoke Bar would get -10 Stars...  \n\nI had reserved the Jack Daniels Room for my birthday day on July 25th and never have I been so disappointed with a venue, staff and atmosphere in my life.  For the amount I was paying per hour ($100 per hour), I can say the people in the main room probably got better service than us and they didn't have a private room.  The moment from we walked in to the time we left it was all an unpleasant experience. When I made the reservation, I was told we would have a waitress to attend to us, however, when we arrived we were in the room for at least 30 mins no waitress had come in for our drink order, or to offer any water since the room temperature was so hot.  In addition the ipad had already had connection problem.  At this moment, a few of us just took it upon ourselves to just go outside to get our own drinks.  At this moment I had informed the front desk about our system and ask if there is a waitress that comes to that room. As she responded rudely and as if I was bothering her she just answered \"ok\" so I just walked away.   As my guest and I went to the bar for drinks, it took another 20 mins or so just to get our drinks. When we go back to the room I had ask my boyfriend if the waitress had come yet and he informed me that she hasn't.  This was really irritating. About 5 mins later a lady came in to fix the ipad and take our order.  AS one of my guest, who was just at the bar, indicated to the bartender that he was in a private room and asked to close his tab, the bartender told him its was ok to keep the credit card up with them, however when he placed the order in the room, he was told a different story.  The waitress indicated that she couldn't get the credit card from them, but will only do this one time, all with a unpleasant attitude. And still at the end of the night, my guest still had to track down her credit card as it appeared non of the staff knew where it was.  \n\nSo as the night progress, I think we saw the waitress only two more times.  Now to have a private room, paying $100 an hour and seeing the waitress only three times was unreal! As I walked to the restroom, I saw the crowd in the main room and thought to myself, I should've just been out there as it looked as if they were all getting services than us.  And for being my Birthday, I was very unhappy.  \n\nAs time got closer to 12am, (which my reservation I made was from 9-12) I asked the waitress for my bill about 11:50 pm.  Than at 12:05am, still no bill and the system was not working anymore. We thought to ourselves, \"o maybe they have it on a timer\". So as it was now 12:20am we just decided to go to the cashier. There, I had had an encounter with the most ruddiest, unpleasant and inconsiderate woman who also indicated she was the manager.  At this point I explained all my unpleasant experiences, and how I was so unhappy with the service. Yes she gave me a $50 credit, but than I still had a bill for $300 when I had already paid $50 as a deposit and they gave me $50 credit. I tried to make sense of the bill and it seemed as she was getting mad and irritated. On my bill, I only paid for two drinks, so again you can see how many times the waitress was around.  I wasn't happy that I had to pay the 18% for tip when I felt the service level was NOT at a level where it should of been and for some reason I'm still confuse of the Tax that was included as well with was more than my drinks.  I'm still mad, frustrated, irritated that I was charged for a service that actually I didn't have.  \n\nAs irritated as I was, knowing at the end of the day I spent nearly $350+ on this  venue, I walked up those stairs with a sour taste in my mouth and out of 43 yrs celebrating my Birthday this was the worst I ever experience. Driving 40mins back home, I kept talking about was how unpleasant this place was, the staff, the service etc.  By far, worst experience I ever had for spending that kind of money.  \n\nThis place is really a waste of time and money.", "author": "Christine D."}

This review is a tad delayed, but necessary.\n\nI had my birthday at Pandora a few months ago and had a great time.  Good friends in an enclosed space with drinks a' flowing, singing into microphones and acting out the lyrics of our fav songs with ridiculous props (brought by us, not provided by Pandora) - what's not to like?  Though we had a great time, I don't think we would come back to Pandora for a number of reasons:\n\n1.  Shady gratuity practices: Pandora charges 20% gratuity on the cost of the room rental.  That makes no sense since gratuity is inextricably linked to service, not space rentals.  That's like charging tip for a room in a hotel.  There was no service involved with our room rental and they should NOT have charged us tip on this.  They should have only charged us tip on the drinks that we ordered.  Sh-sh-shady!  Not sure why we didn't fight this...  \n\n2.  Song selection: Minimal.  It was pretty difficult for us to fill our queue with songs that we wanted to sing for 2 hours and there were some obvious karaoke songs that they were lacking.  As much as we enjoyed our renditions of Careless Whisper (Sexy Sax Man pantomimes and all) and Too Close (my personal favorite), they definitely need to expand their collection.  \n\n3.  Unsavory location:  This place is in the heart of the 'loin, folks.  My friend had the wheel caps stolen on her car in the 2 hours that we were inside.  Yeah...  I would recommend taking a cab.  Also, the guys WILL be patted down, so be prepared to get friendly with the bouncer.  I totally am not against this since the area is not the best area, but just a warning.\n\nTruth be told, the rooms are nice and comfy and the rates are reasonable.  If I was an avid karaoke-er and this was something that my friends and I often did for fun, I might come back.  But I would definitely raise a fuss about the hidden fee described in item #1 above.", "author": "Julie S."}

I've only been in the private rooms so I'm not really sure how the experience is singing outside these private rooms. I've been in the Hello Kitty room once for my birthday and the SF Giants room, which both hold up to 15 people. Once inside these rooms, you get \"room service\" where the staff brings you whatever your heart desires. My only complaint is that when you want to pick a song, you have to go up to the karaoke machine thing and punch in your numbers from the song book. There's no remote that you can pass around your friends and punch the numbers in without having to stand up and block people's views from seeing the lyrics on the screen. Haha. Other than that, I always have a good time here. If you split the costs with at least 10 people, your bill comes out to be very cheap :)\n\nI do recommend calling in to reserve a room though because they get pretty packed, especially during Fridays and weekends.

Pandora seemed like the perfect refuge from the Tenderloin.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a brief visit quickly turned into one of the highlights of our trip. None of my friends are practitioners of karaoke, so when we saw patron after patron perform their songs with such heart and reckless abandon, I knew we were gonna need a couple more drinks to do this place justice. I was pretty scared knowing that in a few minutes, I would probably have to face some type of peer pressure. That crippling variety of peer pressure where you find yourself speechless, wondering where your autonomy went. \n\nFuck it, I said. I'm going big. So I chose a Fleetwood Mac song to sing with a friend. The most sentimental song I could find. By the time it was our turn to go, the lights had become a blur and everyone in the place was on my side. It was great. I belted that shit out like I meant it with no inhibitions. \n\nWatching my friends go up and perform like drunken fools was also a great sight to witness. In that moment, we were all just enjoying ourselves and each other's company.\n\nThe last performance we witnessed was from an old man named Harold, his choice of old love songs had eased us through the night and to see him go again right before we left was a nice unscripted way to send us off and end our night.", "author": "Chris W."}

Love the concept of the themed rooms, how there is a separate bar and lounge area for people who want to sing onstage, that you can sing your heart out while being intoxicated and without having to sneak in drinks unlike other places that do not have their liquor license, and there's an even an option to order sushi and food if you were hungry. A recipe for some good times with good company.\n\nReserved the Ciroc room for our party of 20 people for my birthday celebration for 2 and half hours. Room is advertised to fit 15-25 people but it was pretty filled to the max with just 20 people in the room. The rate is only $50 an hour, and the room was clean and comfortable with a little fan in the room as well. There was no remote, but instead a small computer screen and mouse in the front of the room to select your songs, but the machine was easy enough to use. We got the cheapest bottle of vodka there which was 42 below for $100 but I would just suggest spending an extra $50 and getting something else such as patron or Hennessy because 42 below was pretty nasty and it wasn't that strong. They also have decent pricing on the beers, 6 bottles for $20 bucks. \n\nIt was halloween weekend so the girls working there were dressed in super cute bunny costumes. The waitresses were really friendly and helpful in showing us how the machine worked. Song section was pretty good, quite a few recent songs.

One tip for you if you ever still want to try this place: please ensure to get a WRITTEN confirmation in DETAILS when you reserve it. And be ready how RUDE they are. Once you get in there they DON'T CARE. \nI don't wanted to ruin my birthday party so I was just bearing and dealing with the fact. \n\nWhat happened was: I have reserved my table in VIP lounge for 10 person with one bottle order US120~140 - a must. (It has been recommended by them to book VIP lounge.) First failure, the actual lounge was open to public and not a private area at all as they explained. It is just separate sitting corner at the public hall next to DJ. \nI have sent an email and got a confirmation but also I was talking to them over the phone to get more details. \nOne female staff was confirming that I can extend one more table without any extra charge in case more than 10 people as I checked. Thought they were very nice. - BIG MISTAKE.\n\nSince I've made a reservation like 2 weeks prior to my day, I was calling them to reconfirm on the reservation status 2 hour before I head there. They told me they never promised two tables for one bottle order so I need to buy one more bottle for an extra table. I was complaining to them and they asked me to wait and hold the call then they passed the phone to one guy. So I was explaining the situation to him then he told me \"Just come over.  We will settle it as you requested.\" - I have asked him twice to reconfirm they will arrange it as I requested and got his name \"Mr LEE\" \n\nWhen I get there, I found one small table even can't accomodate 10 person and next two other tables have been reserved per them so I can't get any extra one of those. \nBut also at the other hand, they told me I need to buy one more bottle for an extra table so I mentioned about Mr. Lee who THEY put him to talk to me. - I thought he is the bar owner or manager something. \nCan you guess what was their response? \"He is just a security guy.\" Firstly, then why they put him on the phone to talk to me. Secondly, I felt that they have almost threatened me with this big Bouncer to came down. \"Mr. Lee\" the security guy also changed the word he never promised any over the phone. \nThe female staff who wear the black glasses, she asked me \"You can cancel the reservation if you want. We never given two tables with one bottle bla bla..\" sigh... WHAT??  It is my birthday tonight oh my....- per staff she is in charge of all bookings and only handled by her. - I needed to just move to one other room and just deal with this as I don't wanted to ruin my birthday as my friends are all on the way.\nBut seriously they need to improve on the attitude. And drink price are not reasonable. Themed room was fine. What they care is only getting money. \nAnd I found the outside \"VIP lounge\" was totally empty whole night.\n\nI would never ever come back to this place and strongly recommend to find other places in Japan town that might be better.", "author": "Chris L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-04", "description": "Below is an email that was sent to Pandora after they kept messing up our room reservation. Basically what happened was that we requested a room for my birthday event weeks early, even writing down \"if _____ room is unavailable, my second and third choices are _____ and ______ , and if those rooms are unavailable, please provide me with any room\" and they STILL weren't able to accommodate my request. Lastly, when we finally got a room reserved (with the wrong time, as noted in the email below), when we went the day of my birthday Pandora LOST OUR RESERVATION even though I had email confirmation.  \n\nEmail:\n\nFrankly, our experience with your reservation system has been nothing short of terrible. First of all, it was difficult enough getting a room we wanted because the delay in your email system requires customers to wait for Pandora to confirm that the room they want is available. During this waiting period, even though the room was previously available when the customer had sent the email, Pandora can still reserve it for another party who asks for it. This is what happened to our request for the Blue Moon Room. Moreover, during this waiting period other rooms are quickly filling up and the requirement that customers need to wait to find out about their first choice prevents them from getting their second or third choices after they learn that their first choice is unavailable. Rooms filled up while we waited for Pandora's slow email responses.\n\nOnce we finally did get confirmation that a room we wanted was reserved, this confirmation did not truly count as a reservation because Pandora can just give the room away without checking in with the customer at all! Requiring that customers provide credit card information through insecure email is patently unreasonable at best and absurdly unprofessional at worst. And, because Pandora has strangely decided that it makes more sense to have its booking agent separate from its main desk (with apparently very little to no communication between the two), a customer's frustrations trying to call in with credit card information and consistently getting unanswered voicemails do not allow the booking agent to follow-up with the customer.  It's pretty unprofessional to tell a customer that their room is reserved and then revoke their reservation without any warning or inquiry into the customer's attempts at providing credit card information.\n\nSimply put, Pandora's reservation system has too many steps, too many people to contact, and too little certainty. Although I understand that Pandora is just trying to fill as many rooms as efficiently and quickly as possible, a reservation system that focuses only on filling rooms while completely disregarding customer choice and certainty is one that will inevitably result in a tremendous amount of customer dissatisfaction. \n\nLastly, please note that our reservation is from 11:00 to 1:00 and NOT 10:00 to 1:00 as your previous email incorrectly confirmed.  I find it painfully amusing (but hardly surprising) that even after two weeks of trying to make a simple reservation and finally securing a room, I need another exchange of emails to make sure our reservation is at the right time.\n\nPRO- Major props to the bouncer who was nice to me, kept his cool, and listened to me rant even though I was so upset that they lost my reservation!

The place is cool but could use some improvements... \n\nWe were in the Ciroc room, which was nice. It was supposed to fit 25 people \"comfortably\" but the couches were full with 17. I peaked into the Crown Royal room and it looks like it fills up at 11ish, not 15 like the site says.\n\nThe service was hit-and-miss throughout the night. The hostess was very nice but when my party arrived they stood at the front desk for 10 minutes waiting for someone to tell them where to go. That's 10 minutes of room time I'm paying for! You would think the bartenders could be included in that information to help out when they're not busy--and they weren't..\nServers came in to take drink/food orders every 20-30 minutes. Drinks came quickly enough but some of the food took WAY too long. One girl ordered a sushi plate when she arrived at 7:15 and didn't receive it until 8:50!! 95 minutes for sushi?! And 10 minutes before we had to leave!! Embarrassing. For me and hopefully for Pandora.\n\nThe big drawback to the whole experience was the song selection. The machine you use is difficult to navigate and the song you select is totally unpredictable. We only used Michael Jackson songs and the # of choices was decent, but there was no way to tell if the song would have the real music video with it, lyrics or no lyrics, and every song had his voice in it with no way to turn it off. I thought the point of karaoke was to make you the singer--not to just sing over the original artist.\n\nThe biggest issue out of all of these problems is the lack of lyrics. Only about 2 out of 5 songs had lyrics on the screen!!\nI asked the hostess if there was a way to turn the words on and she said \"No, it's how they're downloaded. I guess the guy who downloaded the Michael Jackson stuff just downloaded some of them without lyrics..\" WTF?\n\nWe were here from 7-9pm on a Sunday. The Happy Hour 50% off room rates PLUS the groupon I bought made the room a great deal! Only $20 tax/gratuities plus the $25 I paid for a $50 groupon. $45 for 2 hours is fabulous, but I wouldn't come back at full-price ($140?).\n\nNutshell--It was a good time that we wouldn't have had without Pandora.\nThe private rooms are really cool, but make sure you know how to navigate the machine before your guests arrive and politely let the hostess know that you expect timely service.", "author": "Ashley W."}

There is also a \"bar\" area outside with an open mic style karaoke too for those who might have a small group or those who aren't able to get a room.\n\nWe arrived before 9 so we were able to get happy hour prices.  20$ for a bucket of 6 beers, 3$ well drinks.  The rooms were quite clean and the entire experience was food.

Made reservations via email with Kimmy, who was very nice.  She called me the day before to tell me the room we wanted was \"out of order\" so she moved us to another room - no biggie.  \n\nWe got there a little early and not our whole party was there so we hung out at the bar and ordered a few drinks and buckets of beer. We get to our room after all of us spending over $100 at the bar.  Room was nice, cool song selections - we started having a good time, ordering more beer, drinks (some of us went to the bar to get the drinks ourselves cause the waitress was slow)  We had to ask them to open a few more bottles that came in the bucket sealed still. And here is where my problems started... \n\nAbout 3 hours into our night and spending quite a significant amount on drinks security barges in our room and says \"YOU GOT TO GO\".  Shocked of course - I reply \"what's going on?\"  He proceeds to tell us, that we brought a beer from outside into the room - UH OK!  Why would any of us bring in ONE beer in from outside when we ordered BUCKETS of beer from the bar throughout the night, shots, mixed drinks, etc... WHY?!  Made no sense!  So we walk out to talk to the manager (Jeff) who proceeds to accuse me and my party of bringing in this ONE BEER because it was unopened (BY THE WAY, I HAVE PROOF THEY DON'T OPEN ALL THE BEERS IN A FEW PICTURES WE TOOK THAT NIGHT AND THEY ARE IN THE BACKGROUND! One pic even shows the bucket still on the bar with half the bottles opened and half sealed).  I even asked our waitress to tell them how some were not opened and 2 different people had to come and open the bottles for us and she lied and said she doesn't even have a bottle opener - LIE!!! \n\nWhile i was out there - I brought one of the mics out to give him because the bottom of it was loose (was like that when we got it - it got looser throughout the night and I probably should have said something right away, but it was still working so I was trippin)  The manager proceeds to accuse us of breaking the mic - again WHY would we do that!  No one in our party was belligerent in any way and weren't doing anything other than using the mic as it is intended.  If i broke it I would have just left it there not bring it out to show him! He tells me that they check all their mics and I need to pay for the mic ($50!). Obviously humans are prefect and there is no way that the person who \"checks\" things cold have overseen this?! right. We told them to look at their camera footage and see we weren't doing anything to break the mic and didn't bring any beer into the room. He said he would check it later and if so then give me a refund.  Trying to just check out and get the hell out of there so that our night didn't get worse I come to get an almost $400 bill!  Jeff did adjust it a little for the beers we had left in the room that no one got to drink cause we got kicked out. No call from Jeff today... let's see if I hear from him tomorrow.  \n\nWhile half our party was outside waiting for the rest of us that were trying to talk to the manager and explain ourselves and sort our bill out one of the bouncers told the other half of our party that this kind of stuff happens all the time there and that most of the staff are new and don't know anything... explains alot!\n\nSUCKS, I did really like the place at first despite a few minor things (I even referred a few people I know with up coming parties to go there cause it looked really cool - but after being treated so rudely and being accused of things I will definitely not be returning and I will be telling all the people I referred to go there my story and urge them not to go!", "author": "Cristina H."}

We ordered drinks which came pretty quickly and the prices aren't that bad. The girls that were working were really nice except when the bill came...it just took forever! When we got there around 8ish it was really slow by an hour later we could here people singing outside. We decided to move outside and join the crowd which was a lot of fun. The MC's were funny and had a few musical instruments for people to play.  My friends ordered food and said it was not bad. They serve Japanese food there.  When we moved outside to the main lounge area, we got to sit in the VIP area because our friend knew the owners. Beware there were updated songs but the playlist was a little hard to navigate in the room and it didn't seem like there were much choices. When we went out to the main lounge, the book out there had more songs to chose from. I was told that sometimes the rooms have songs, the main lounge does not have and vice versa.  \n\nThe neighborhood is a little sketchy because its in the tenderloin but the bar itself is pretty nice.

One of the few karaokes that offers the singing and drinking experience.  Staff was friendly and attentive. \n\n***The Bads:\n\nTouch Screen Control - There is no remote control to select songs.  One of us had to get up and walk over to the control screen if we want to skip a song or select a song.  I think this is by far the worst thing among the other bad things.  Pandora should really consider changing that.  \n\nLocation, Location - It is located in a very sketchy area, the heart of TL.  Don't even think about going there by public transportation or find a street parking.  The only safe place to park your car is the next door valet, $15 flat rate. Ouch. \n\nSong Selection - Limited Chinese and English songs selection.  They don't even have Taylor Swift! = (\n\nWireless Mic - We had so much trouble with the wireless mic.  Seems like you have to direct the bottom of the mic toward the sensor in order to receive good signal.  Often we heard annoying static sounds in the background caused by the mic.  \n\nHello Kitty? - We checked out the legendary Hello Kitty room, but it's really just a room with one Hello Kitty pillow sitting in the corner, and some pink bows on the sofa.  Not Hello Kitty enough in my opinion.  \n\nConclusion: I think it's a good business model to have a full bar and order drinks in a karaoke.  The business did put in some thoughts in the theme rooms.  It is one of a kind in San Francisco.  However, many negative things have overcame the goods.  Sorry, 1-star for you.", "author": "Jamie L."}

Private rooms and also a central stage. \n\nThe P.A. in the central state is definitely not as good as some of the private rooms for whatever reason, but it gets the job done. I do think it also depends on the song. I tried \"Motownphilly\", but couldn't hear the damn track and got lost and made a fool of myself.

Definitely use the buddy system when coming out here! Besides, karaoke is the most fun when you're with a group! \n\nI came here to celebrate my birthday with some friends last week. I made a reservation for a private room through email earlier that week and they fulfilled my request pretty quickly, and even emailed back AND called to confirm the reservation. Careful crew there! They will ask you to provide your credit card info in advance though (They will charge you if you're a no-show), so hope you're comfortable with that.\n\nI did wish that I had made my reservation earlier though. They have such a fun selection of rooms to choose from---as a big Giants fan, I had my eyes set on the San Francisco Giants room but that was already booked, so I went with one of the few options that was actually available, which was the Heineken room. Painted and lit green and marked by that iconic red star and label. Many of the rooms are based on liquor brands, like Grey Goose, Pyramid, and Blue Room. I passed by some of them and they all look very classy! One of the other non-liquor themed rooms is the Hello Kitty room, which is perfect if you're a girly girl!\n\nThe bouncer checks IDs and bags at the door, and there's a TSA-esque patdown too if you're a guy (IDK). The check-in process went well, but they do hold your ID and credit card at the front desk when you reserve a room. We had a lovely host to escort us to our room and briefly showed us to work the song selector. The room was very comfortable, clean, and trendy, and really just perfect! The menu seemed pretty limited, but the host will bring the food and drinks right to you, no need to go out. There's even a service button on the monitor for you to press---SO convenient!\n\nThat being said, the song thingymabob was pretty painful to work---very disorganized, not that touch sensitive, and just a whole lot of ugggghhhh. I can't even explain it here. But once you're able to get some sense of it, you'll find a pretty grand selection. If you're Filipino (Or know someone who is...or want to be Filipino) like me, you likely own a Magic Mike with a bunch of beloved songs from the 20th century. Let's face the hard truth: Magic Mikes are nice but their song selections can be pretty dismal if you're looking for something more contemporary. Pandora allows the cool kids to actually sing their age. :) Some of the tunes we got stupid along to included Jessie J's \"Domino,\" Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream,\" Taylor Swift's \"Sparks Fly,\" and our favorite of the night, David Guetta and Sia's \"Titanium.\" But of course, those Magic Mike classics were available too, Heart's \"Alone\" and Kim Carnes' \"Bette Davis Eyes\" amongst the ones in our list.\n\nThe lounge is absolutely gorgeous on the eyes---very modern decor, and pretty decent sized. If you just want to drink, hang out with friends, sing without paying a fee, or watch others lose their dignity, then you're in the right place. I guess there's no other way to do it, but I wasn't very happy having to fill out a slip of paper with the song I wanted to sing and my name, only to never get called up. I was all liquored up and ready, so the world missed its opportunity to see me shriek shamelessly to my favorite Bon Jovi song.

Though the location is a bit sketch with a bunch of hoodrats waiting in line for suite 181 and a bunch of crackheads standing around staring you down, it's a bit of a struggle to get in here. But once you do, oOOOOOOOOO.. let me tellll you!\n\n\nRooms: \n\n*The 'community room' with the bar and a public karaoke stage is a ingenious idea, it's very fun and welcoming. It's a great alternative to a night out being shoved in clubs. did i mention.. BAR?!\n\n*The private rooms are crazy! they have numerous themes, (ie. hello kitty, heineken, hennessey, and many more).. The mics are all infrared, which seem to be a problem in my room as one of the mics kept turning off and on. The workers had to come in numerous times to TRY to fix it... it sorta dampen our experience there. \n\n**Songs: a great variety, but they way they are organized can be a bit confusing and hard to navigate. They really do need a remote cause' singing takes a lot of energy from you, and walking to the touch screen is a complete bitch.\n\nPrices:\n\n*It can be a bit expensive if you want a private room for less than 7 people as it is about 50 dollars an hour. But if your aprty has 7 or more, i def. recommend getting a room, with the mics fixed of course.\n\n*Drinks @ the bar are also fairly priced, no need to sneak in alcohol no more. haha\n\nPandora is a great alternative to Do Re Mi or Playground in Japantown. It's a really cool scene with a cooler vibe.. Even with the mic problems and the sketch area, i'm officially hooked. go and check it out you little-wannabe-pop star-lady gaga-singing-monsters.", "author": "Alex C."}

On a Friday there were more asians in the house, but some of the bartenders that worked there told me that they usually have a mix crowd.  The staff are very very nice including the bouncer.

The biggest room is the Hennessy room where the whole room is decorated in Hennessy stuff...kinda neat.  Then they have a ciroc room, Heineken room, blue moon, and my favorite Hello Kitty room.

I'm such a mic hog, more like a mic wild boar because I can get vicious if I have to wait too long. I didn't book a room since I didn't know who'd be showing up to my karaoke birthday jam. It worked out fine, we kind of took over since there weren't too many people there. The KJ that night was Ash Wednesday (yea the moniker was a running joke that night). He was cool except he skips around on the list, which I guess is fair to switch up the singers. He also interjects with his own performances which I guess is fair because if I were a KJ I'd be the ultimate kj (killjoy) because I'd be up on stage all the time. The song selection in the main lounge was quite robust! My boyfriend and I got to bust out some Usher \"Nice and Slow\"!\n\nMy bf got bottle service and on Weds and Thurs, you get a free hour for each bottle.

Cmon now.  they've got rooms with themes like Hennessy (baller status), Crown Royal, Heineken, SF Giants, Pyramid, Grey Goose, and above them all.....the Hello Kitty room, hands down the best.  You can tell they put a lot of work and detail to try and dress up these rooms to fit the theme and they did such an awesome job with it.  \n\nThey've also got happy hour and an open area where you can order your drink from the bar and join in the public room for karaoke.

I was really weary on coming cuz I got my laptop jacked from my car that was parked right in front of the bar back in June but I didn't drive this time which was good. Yes, the area is really sketchy and its not the best place to be walking around at night but most people keep to themselves. \n\nThere was about 9 of us and we got the Grey Goose room. It was half off an hour so it came down to $25 an hour and we stayed for two. We didn't even realize how much time flew by. They had a pretty good selection of songs and it was cool that the playlists selection varied from English, Chinese, Spanish, Korean, Japanese and some other languages. The bar area and rooms are really clean too. We sang songs from love songs all the way to T-Pain and Trey Songz. Totally fun. The guys were such mic hogs LOL. We tried a boys vs girls sing off but the guys seemed to be enjoying themselves more than us which was totally fine. :) \n\nWhat I didn't really like or understand was that we couldn't drink in the private rooms? The girl who helped us said that we were only allowed to drink in the bar area which I thought was really strange. But we were allowed to drink water and soda and all that. So yeah, I don't know.... Also, the girl helping us was also the bartender, the cashier and the waitress. Can you say understaffed? \n\nOther than that, okay service, clean, nice decor and good song selections.

As soon as you walk down the stairs to get in Pandora there's a bar to your left, a reception desk in front of you, & more to the right -- you have a themed big living room where you can sing your heart out to passing customers. \n\nMy friend had her birthday here in June, she rented the Ciroc room (for a solid two hours we paid $200). That place gets really hot inside because having to casually it in 30people, singing & dancing -- prepare to sweat. It's really nice in the rooms, you close the door, turn off the lights, turn on the disco ball, LED TVs on both sides of the room -- it's your own club. \n\nMy boyfriend really liked this place because it had a sushi restaurant upstairs. Waitresses will come in every so often to ask if you want to order from the bar or some sushi -- both bar drinks & sushi we're delicious but a bit on the pricey side. \n\nFour out of five only because they are a tad bit pricey, it's only 21+ (for the friends who have yet to turn legal), & the area is not safe (near the tenderloin). Parking is crucial, the neighborhood is crazy, & you'll have cops chasing bums on every corner. Also, the karaoke machine is something you need to get use too.. it's different & not easy to use. \n\nOverall, the experience was really fun.

Really what makes it a little less safe is being with one of my dear friends. Oh sure we seem harmless enough. But curiosity gets the better of us and really how can you ignore the big flashy light up rainbow sign above the door?\n\nAfter walking down the stairs to the main room, we were encouraged to walk around and explore the space. Wow. There are about 12 rooms through out the tunnels. Some were just simple, clean, comfy rooms. Think modern design. But yes, there are theme rooms. Beverages like Peroni and Heineken have their own rooms, with a large logo and walls and furniture in the same color scheme. And yes, there is a Hello Kitty room (pink, Hello Kitty head pillows, sparkly bows along the sofa). I can see hipster chicks and drag queens from nearby Aunt Charlie's battling it out for the room. The Crown Royal room has a throne. Already I can picture an epic show down for the title King of Karaoke in here. Each of the rooms looked like they could hold at least a dozen people so I'm thinking some Yelpy style reunions of the karaoke variety are in order. \n\nThe staff was really sweet to me and my sweet but tipsy friend. We of course took full advantage of the bar and sipped away on our cocktails as we toured the place. Every one was nice from the guy at the door who waited at least 3 minutes for my drunky self to find my identification to the bartender who tried to buy a cheesesteak off me and my friend.

Their website makes it very easy to get information, explaining the different type of rooms and how many people it can hold. It also gives a break down of price and there's easy email link to make reservations. I received a reply later that day and I felt that I got forced to upgrade to the VIP room that was double the price. The woman said I can have a room for $50/hr, then emailed me back saying she made a mistake in her books  and the only option was the $100/hr rooms.\n\nMy reservations were from 10p-1am and I got there at 10:10pm and the room was not even ready yet. There are security cameras into each room at the front desk monitoring your activity, I glance over at the camera and notice the room is still packed and no where near ready. I was not pleased considering this was a surprise bday party and had people showing up promptly on time. She said there was a smaller 'Japanese' style room available for me in 10 minutes which eventually turned out in my favor because it was the $50/hr price I originally wanted. The Japanese room is probably the most boringest room that they have. The mics didn't work and the karaoke took forever to learn. There are also more Chinese songs than American, and Bohemian Rhapsody did not work. Boo. =/\n\nOverall, they did allow me to bring in cake, food, and decorations to help save myself some cost, but I didn't like the lack of the professionalism. Granted this place is a bar, but I felt that if I'm blowing big money and bottle service, they should have been prepared. Also make sure there is someone slightly sober enough to make sure the tab is correct. They over charged me 2 drinks that were paid separately, which I ended up having to pay anyway because they just argued back. The night was overall a success due to the people I was with; we made ourselves have tons of fun. The idea in general is awesome- drinking and singing 80's songs! I highly recommend it as something different than your typical bar hopping night scene, but it depends on yourself to make the most of it.", "author": "Jessica V."}

Clean, very nicely styled decorated (best I've ever seen), comfortable, room air con & fans you control. We went Sunday 6-9pm to take advantage of happy hour & 50% off private rooms (reg. $50/hour for small), which didn't break the bank for our group of 5 (small rooms hold up to 15, but you'd be elbow to a** with that many). $20 for bucket of 6 beers! But, ask to have them bring you a bottle opener, otherwise they bring ALL of them already opened. $3 well drinks were strong (rare for happy hour specials), service was fast & friendly. Rooms are great if you want to get lots of singing in & have your own space...or if you are shy.\n\nKARAOKE MACHINES MEH. In private rooms, these machines were made for the Asian market, so it's cumbersome having to sift thru all the Asian artists/songs before you find small chunks of English selections. Machines have all the usual pop & rock standards, but we couldn't find the more selective stuff like musicals or new releases. Lounge much better for that via the KJ's selection.\n\nGOOD AFFORDABLE SUSHI! Full menu from the restaurant upstairs & they don't inflate the prices just because they bring it to the club. Caterpillar roll $10.95, 2 item Bento boxes $14.95 convinced us to have dinner here as well. I'd give the food 4 stars for this price range sushi.\n\nPARKING & WALKING IS SCARY. This is the Tenderloin in all it's desperation & ugliness. Dozens of incoherent ragged people walking all around...we almost hit about 3 people who darted into the streets...even though we were driving slow & cautiously. We originally were going to BART in, but the walk to & from BART would not have been pleasant. Since we arrived early (6:30), we thankfully found street parking right across the club. There are plenty of paid parking lots, $7-$20 flat fee. BUT, we weren't directly harassed & the police presence is constant & active.\n\nGREAT KJ, SCOTT! After a couple of hours in our private room, went to the main lounge area. Scott was a very cool, engaging & fun KJ so we found ourselves spending a couple more hours there b/c it was so fun. He's has his own play list in printed book form...SO much easier to use than the private room touch screens. Even though club opens at 6pm, the KJ doesn't start until about 7:30 pm. About 2 dozen people in the lounge/bar, but only 6 repeatedly singing (if you like to sing, you didn't have to wait too long), & the KJ was really good about moving \"new\" people up the list so that everyone had a chance to sing. Crowd was very supportive of all singers, regardless of their ability...which makes for a great night for all. Mostly 20s-30s (we're 40s), couples & birthday groups.

The entire place is very nice, even the main karaoke room where it's free to sing in front of strangers & your friends who are most likely laughing had nice lounge sofas with dim lighting so it's definitely \"loungey\". Another upside was that they had nice, helpful, pretty girls that works there. They even complimented me on my outfit so that's another plus. Gotta plan another concert in another theme room soon. Take advantage of their happy hour specials on rooms for 50% off from 6pm-9pm. Make reservations just to be on the safe side, especially if you have your eye on a certain theme room. My experience went smoothly right from the very start when I e-mailed the establishment to book my room & answered all of my questions in a timely manner. If you plan on coming on a Monday, forget it because they're closed. It is located in the TL's (Tenderloin) but don't worry, you'll live.

I was horribly disappointed by this venue and will not go back. \n\nAnd to quote Solly M:\n\nthe BIGGEST drawback to this place, the karaoke system in the rooms is HORRENDOUS.  The system is \"janky\" to say the least and it seems like a solid 3/4 of the songs are not in English.  Moreover the English selection is severely limited and even when they do have a song that you want, they're either playing some weird non-sequitur video behind the lyrics or they've blatantly ripped off the video from television or YouTube syndication.  \n\nIt certainly seems like the system was pretty much ported straight from Asia without any real consideration as to how native English speakers would react to the song crippled selection, random video backgrounds, persistent lyrics misspellings or mind-boggling interface that doesn't have a functioning search feature.  I was also floored by why there wasn't a keyboard to make things a lot easier.  Instead, searching for a song will take quite a while since most pieces of the software just flat-out don't seem to work.  Why can't they just leave a book of the available listings in the room and have users punch in a song code then manage the queue?Seems a lot easier than the system that they've got going on right now.", "author": "Peter C."}

I think this ridiculous to begin with not to mention the service\\\n was the awful.  $50/hr room * 3hr *18% gratuity = $192.  So $42 for ???  Guess you can basically called it $64/hr for a 15ppl room.\n\n- SONG SELECTION: Although they claim to have large selection of songs, quantity does not replace quality.  Most songs are these cheese versions of song (some include video of starving people in some 3rd world country that make you think of putting down the mic and joining \\\nthe peace corp rather than singing some American pop tune over top of it) and many favorites I've song in other bars are completely missing.  For instance try to find something in the 80's rock category.  Van Halen?  \"nothing\", Motley Crue? \"nothing\", Scorpions? 3 songs but only one I recognized was an awful version of \"Winds of Change\".  Note: I only looked at the English song selections.\n\n- AUDIO:  Yes, wireless mic's are great if they work well.  Instead we battled with them (no we weren't holding the bottom either).  We also got the tech in at one point to try and equalize the sound (too much base), but since the receiver is behind a locked cabinet and all\\\n the song aren't balanced together this really needed to be constantly adjusted so our only  real control was adjusting volume to try and smooth out the rough edges.  Also everything run through echo, which if I'm singing is a good thing but we need options!\n\n- ROOM LAYOUT: Set up like a living room to watch TV, but with the remote control over in the corner next to the TV.  What I mean by this is the song selector touch screen is off in the corner of the room next to the TV.  What I really wanted is that screen to be on the cof\\\nfee table in the center so that people sitting could easily find their next song.\n\nSUMMARY\n============================================\nOnce the newness of this place wears off not sure what it has to offer its customers.

GREAT IDEA! --I really appreciate that the owners took some time to add such fun amenities (Hello Kitty room w/strobelights, Crown Royal room with a pimp throne, and so so many more to choose from...read the reviews or visit the website to see for yourself!).

One month in advance, I booked a room and got the confirmation emails. I even went in person as the event got closer and spoke to the managers and staff (see above) and he re-confirmed that we had the place and as a bonus promised a disco ball (which I was stoked about! and literally told all my friends about). So you would think that 3 confirmations should be enough -- WRONG.!! On separate occasions, I 1.) emailed (got the confirmation), 2)  went in person to speak to the manager (got confirmed), and had 2.) a phone confirmation. But guess what, on the day of the event - NO CONFIRMATION, my room was reserved for another party.\n\nWhat the heck....\n\nWhat was I supposed to tell my friends..? It was sort of embarrassing because I raved about this place. It was even more frustrating when the girl I talked to on the phone did nothing to help me and my 15+ party. They had already given my room to someone else and \"theres nothing they can do about it\" . I really hated the fact that I had to leave my dinner guests to keep calling her to fix the situation. \n\nWhen I arrived, I spoke to the manager and just like that he got me my room back.

We also had two tables: yes, they are sturdy enough to act as a stage for two; yes, we tested this.\n\nThe bartender was really nice, let us linger a little past our rental time, and even made my house liquor-ordered g&t's with Tangueray when they ran out of Sapphire.", "author": "Christina G."}

Really overpriced too - I would not have paid full price without my friend's groupon.\n\nOVERALL PROS:\n- Nice rooms, clean and w/ themes.\n- The search system is decent; there is a touch screen and you can search by artist/song, you can even handwrite.\n- The screen system makes it easy to change volume, request service (for drinks, help), and view your current playlist (and bring songs up to the top, cancel songs, etc).\n- They have the actual video for a lot of popular/mainstream US and even Chinese songs, which is a big selling point.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- Expensive! Even with my friend's Groupon ($75 for $190 - 2 hours and well drinks for everyone) plus an extra hour undiscounted, it was $24 per person for 7 people. This is reasonable, but you can definitely get cheaper rooms in other places WITHOUT a discount.\n- There's a main bar area with a public karaoke stage which is LOUD. You can hear it even in your private rooms.\n- The touchscreen is really difficult to maneuver sometimes, it's not always responsive to where you click with your fingers. \n- It's really hard to search for Chinese songs - you have to go through hundreds of pages sometimes or you deal with the difficult handwrite function that doesn't pick up your writing unless you press really hard with your nails into the screen.\n- They didn't have a lot of songs we were hoping to sing - Weezer's Say It Ain't So, and they had Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody but every time it came up on the queue it just automatically skipped! This happened with a few other songs too.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

The rooms are all pretty nice - they have really nice couches, big screens, and quality audio. The HK room had a stripper pole, but none of us wanted to get an STD so we just left that alone.

I have been going pretty regularly for over a year and half now.  I really like the layout...the lounge has a nice open layout with comfy seating (in SF it can be challenging to find places that aren't completely cramped).  There is a nice long bar and a karaoke stage that isn't too intimidating (slightly raised and can fit a few people, but NOT 4 feet off the ground and large enough to fit a whole band--it highlights the singer while not putting too much focus on them).  \n\nPandora is the type of place to have regulars which can be a comfort to see while also drawing in all sorts of people.  It is the type of place where shy people actually get up and sing, where people aren't judged for their voices or song selections, and that can go from completely empty to almost a club-scene.  In this way, it works for all different types of people, especially when you learn the best time to come for your preferences.  \n\nBesides just the karaoke lounge area (with alternating KJs--karaoke DJs---who have their own song selections) there are private rooms.  Although the private rooms can be pretty pricey when compared to other places with only rooms, there is usually a great Groupon deal available to help counter-balance those prices.\n\nAll of that being said, Pandora has its moments like the latches not working well on the stalls in the ladies rest room, ending happy hour prices over half a year ago, or having a weekly karaoke contest (I'm not big on contests, lol).  (But note that happy hour is back (m-f 6-8pm) which has me happy!)  I know some people are also nervous about the neighborhood.  What I can say is that I walk there and back pretty often, usually by myself, and nothing has ever actually happened, so its one of those cases where I think looks can be deceiving (kind of like hole-in-walls that have absolutely amazing food)--if anything, it is very indicative of SF itself.\n\nSo, long story short.  Pandora has a great atmosphere that can allow shy people to feel comfortable, those with stage-fright to get up and sing, those who are tone-deaf to get cheers, those who don't dance to dance, and finally, it is the type of place where they remember your drink orders and welcome you to sing your blues away!", "author": "Kate A."}

We went here last night and it was not our first choice, but we didn't call ahead for other places and they had a room open so we gave them another shot. \n\n- Cons\n\n- The karaoke system is as dumb as ever. Have to get up, stand in a corner wasting time \"browsing\" through their selections. Had a \"New Songs\" tab, we hit that, list was empty...not a good sign. There was a book this time with all the songs in there...but they only gave us 1 book, and the codes in there for the songs are a mix of 6 numbers and a letter...not easy to remember as you have to get up and go to that corner to punch it in...even harder to remember after you've had a few drinks. \n\n- Besides the system, there were no new songs within the last 5 months or so. So in my opinion, the selection is quite outdated. People want to sing new songs, not come to your karaoke place over half a year in between and still sing the same old stuff they sang last time because your selection isn't updated.\n\n- We ordered Pork Buns. Buns were good, but, the issue is that some busboy-type guy came in and took our plates while we were singing, and there was still a bun there. This is just ridiculous, if they are going to take it, at least ask if we are finished with it. \n\n- Water we got tasted \"fruity\", for lack of a better word, which meant that the jar it came in probably wasn't washed very well. \n\n- Bouncers were pretty rude is telling us to leave when the place closed up. I understand it's been a long day for you all, but honestly is all the hushing and pushing and LEAVE NOW attitude necessary? No, it's not...pretty much ever. Dude tried to kick us out 3x while we were IN LINE TO PAY. If they didn't have one of our licenses and credit cards, I would've just left and sang for free. \n\nPros...well they gave us an extra pork bun because they took so long making it. But then as I mentioned above, they took that one away.

Loved the themed rooms and how clean the rooms were. Came here with a groupon in addition to it being happy hour so 50% off room rates. I would suggest coming here during happy hour specially if you have a large group of friends. \n\nWas disappointed that we weren't able to get the rooms we wanted (crown, hello kitty,) because they were booked 2 weeks in advance apparently. But when we arrived, no one was in the crown room, when we left, no party ever entered the crown room so, I'm not sure what was happening there. Miscommunication maybe? But we got the ciroc room which was pretty nice. Very comfy couches. And the best part, they have up to date songs. Except when we were trying to pick keri hilson's, \"knock you down\" it didn't work. Not sure why.  \n\nSo yelp says, 50% off room rates and drink specials. They're being sneaking with that drink special, there is no drink special menu, there is no drink menu period except for beer and soda. The food was alright, their jalapeno poppers did not disappoint, however their calamari looked like onion rings and didn't taste like calamari. \n\nWould definitely come back with a larger group, maybe when there is another groupon or something offered. Oh, and also, I didn't realize what other yelpers were talking about, it being located in the ghetto. But yes, it is located in the ghetto.

However, my boyfriend, who I adore loves this stuff and that's what he wanted to do for his birthday. That's right folks, the only person on earth I would do this for. Love hurts. :o)\n\nSurprisingly, I had a really fun time and I almost, yes ALMOST sang a song! Thankfully I didn't, otherwise the stray dogs on the other side of town would have started howling if they heard me.\n\nWe reserved a private room - the Harmonics room. I seriously thought I had been transported to a karaoke bar in Tokyo. This is one of the more subdued rooms. It's a rectangular shape, that has a long rectangular table in the middle and a booth running all around it. A little tight when you have to try to move from one part of the room to the other, but hey, we're all friends here.\n\nThe high-tech karaoke machine took a little getting used to, but they got it working and the little rock stars in everyone shined through. Admittedly I got a great deal of entertainment just by watching the horrendous videos that went with the songs. Picture it circa 1991, bad hair, bad outfits, bad European disco-pop dancing. Hilarious!!! Only a few songs actually had the artists in the videos. Oh the joys of copyright infringement.\n\nI have to say the gal that was our room attendant/waitress/hostess, whatever you want to call her was super sweet and very attentive. The bucket of beers were flowing my friends. Everyone was enjoying themselves, even me, the one who can't stand karaoke.\n\nOnce our time was up in the room, we headed out to the main part of the bar, and of course the boys kept singing. After a couple of hours my boyfriend and his best friend topped off the night as the dynamic duo on stage and took the house down.  Satisfied with their performance, we were ready to call it a night.\n\nI gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 because of the music selection in the room. Supposedly there were 100,000 songs in the system, but there were some music classics missing from the play list. Other than that, a great time was had by all and I have a sneaky suspicion we'll be back.", "author": "Susan B."}

My mouse was wavering between 3 and 4 stars like my friends' voices were wavering between notes. \n\nWe had a great time at Pandora Karaoke & Bar. I booked the 42 Below room (up to 15 people, $50 an hour) and after a brief video tutorial and explanation from our waitress we ventured into song selection. The room itself was very comfortable and clean, and I can't fault the service. We enjoyed the copious amount of alcohol we consumed, and our waitress didn't seem to mind we were packing in a few more people than the space allowed. All good things.\n\nThe drinks were brought promptly, and everyone was allowed to keep a separate tab which was paid at the end of the night. I stuck to dirty gin martinis and was very happy with whatever they put in it. There was some confusion about whose drinks were whose, but we solved it by taking sips of whatever happened to be in front of us at that time.\n\nThe karaoke sound system, as others have said, left something to be desired. There is a fairly extensive catalogue, but the process of finding songs (even with the tutorial) was difficult. There were very few songs on the list that were produce after 1990, and many of the accompanying music videos were... how shall I put this... comically sexual and dated. It was erotica meets \"Saved By The Bell\" and was confusing to say the least. We had issues with the microphones, a lot of feedback and it was hard to hear the singers even with the volume adjusted. However, that may have been more a fault of 15+ people screaming along to \"Fat Bottom Girls\" than the mikes themselves.\n\nTowards the end of the night the room was like a furnace, we had to keep the door open in order to keep the temperature down, which helped somewhat. BUT, all that being said, I would go again and recommend it to friends. Everyone really enjoyed themselves, sang their hearts out, and left smiling.", "author": "Lili K."}

I probably won't be going back there any time soon.\n\nPros:\nWe rented out the Jameson room and it was nice, large enough for our group and we appreciated the complementary drinks and sushi.  The staff was also pretty attentive to our needs whether it was changing out the batteries in the microphones or altering the temperatures in the room.\n\nCons:\nFirst of all, the neighborhood it's is pretty shady to say the least.  But as many people have said before, and this is the BIGGEST drawback to this place, the karaoke system in the rooms is HORRENDOUS.  The system is \"janky\" to say the least and it seems like a solid 3/4 of the songs are not in English.  Moreover the English selection is severely limited and even when they do have a song that you want, they're either playing some weird non-sequitur video behind the lyrics or they've blatantly ripped off the video from television or YouTube syndication.  \n\nIt certainly seems like the system was pretty much ported straight from Asia without any real consideration as to how native English speakers would react to the song crippled selection, random video backgrounds, persistent lyrics misspellings or mind-boggling interface that doesn't have a functioning search feature.  I was also floored by why there wasn't a keyboard to make things a lot easier.  Instead, searching for a song will take quite a while since most pieces of the software just flat-out don't seem to work.  Why can't they just leave a book of the available listings in the room and have users punch in a song code then manage the queue?Seems a lot easier than the system that they've got going on right now.\n\nOverall, it was fine since we were all pretty drunk by the time we got there, but next time I go looking for a karaoke bar in the city, Pandora will probably be one of the last places on my list.", "author": "Solly M."}

A couple of my friends were working at Pandora as KJs and I would go hang out and sing w/ them. I went there so often that I became \"friends\" w/ some of the staff, including the bar manager. I loved going to Pandora - friendly faces, cool lounge area and I would sing duets w/ my friends - a karaoke lovers dream. I have even celebrated my birthdays there twice. But in 2011 or 2012, I had to boycott Pandora. After spending many nights, bringing many friends there, and spending lots of money there I was not let in one night due to bringing in a slice of pizza - something I'd done before. But I'm reasonable. I understand that they are a business and they changed their outside food policy so that the upstairs restaurant could make some money. But mind you, there were times the restaurant was closed or had limited items of food. The night I went in w/ pizza the restaurant was serving 4 types of those Asian buns w/ meat inside. AND the staff were eating PIZZA and Thai food from neighboring businesses. So why was I given such a hard time? I emailed the bar manager, Van, about it and he never responded to my complaint. It was then that I decided to spend my money elsewhere. Following this incident, 2 out of the 3 friends that were KJs there quit for various reasons. (they don't treat their staff right). Last Friday, my birthday, a few of my friends and I wanted to do a little karaoke'ing after the Giants game & I decided to go to Pandora due to proximity... and my 1 friend who still works there has been trying to convince me to lift the ban. So I went, even though my friend wasn't working that night. I don't even know why I'm surprised, but I am. Maybe more like appalled. My 3 friends who arrived to Pandora before me were not let in b/c they didn't have a reservation and while they waited for me to arrive, they saw Asian and White people go in - like 20 of them. Did I mention my friends are Black? What the \"smart\" business people who run Pandora don't know is that my friends and myself are all at least Master-level educated people who truly like to have clean Karaoke fun. And have the money to spend in a nice, friendly environment. The ban is continued. I highly discourage anyone to go there b/c they do not know what good costumer service is. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED  that as a once upon a time regular, my message was not even regarded by the bar manager and the same bar manager and security person looked my friends up and down and then said no to letting them in w/out explanation.

Please put this on your list! In addition, I couldn't help but go back to my childhood days, that is the 90s and to find no Paula Abdul! Crisis. The upside of the music selection is that many of the modern music have the MTV screen plays instead of the generic, soft-porn looking type of videos. \n\nWe needed ventilation! There was a portable white fan in the back of the room which was supposed to be our AC. So we used that and left the door open which gladly the staff didn't ask us to close. \n\nService was friendly. Very attentive. Also no smoking in the rooms! Love how I don't smell like an ashtray after I leave a karaoke bar. \n\nThe systems are immediately shut off by 2AM and the staffers are adamant about kicking you out of the place.

I'm no stranger to this horribly embarrassing pastime, and Pandora is a huge step up from your typical smoky dive full of wannabee singers. Lounge-like and lowlit, the main room is perfect for gathering with your twenty (or thirty!) closest friends for a sing-a-long session. The Vegas style lights behind the stage add an extra dose of campy fun, and their song selection is ginormous! I escaped to find the bathroom during a coworker's painful rendition of a 90s radio classic and found myself wandering past a slew of private party rooms positioned along a back hallway. Each room was totally decked out in its own theme, from Crown Royal to Hello Kitty. Weird? Yes. Fun as hell? I thought so! Though the bar imposed a $20 minimum for credit card transactions, the bartenders were attentive and efficient, making it much easier to reach that total. Embarrassing antics aside, Pandora is a great destination for karaoke in San Francisco and one I will remember on future trips!", "author": "Katie C."}

Did some research and decided that besides the shady practices by management that I read about, this place would fit the bill. \n\nFrist problem: I called and emailed to book the Absolut Room. Thought it looked fun. Took a few days for them to get back to me (luckily I gave enough time before hand that it was fine). When they emailed me, they said all they needed was my credit card number to hold the room. Like any reasonable person, I didn't feel comfortable emailing that information, so I immediately responded to the email asking them to call me to provide my CC number. No call. 24 hours later I emailed again asking them to call me. By the time they called the Absolut room had been booked by someone else (mind you, they told me it was available before they went radio silent). It was fine, I took the other large room Jack Daniels. \n\nCut to night of event: UBER drops us off in the hood. This area is ghetto. But we're going inside a place guarded by big bouncers. First off, bouncers were hostile and searched everyone's bags. Once I checked in they gave me a business card-sized piece of paper that had their \"rules\" listed out. I just signed it to be done and get singing! The room itself was cool - smelt like cedar and definitely fit the 25 people that came. The song selection, on the other hand, was tragic. I was SO disappointed with the lack of classic karaoke songs from the private room. How can they go about charging $100/hour (with a 3 hour minimum) and NOT have ok songs? We were also shorted a mic (supposed to get 4, only got 3) and one stopped working halfway through. A bar back kept coming in the room to clear drinks (but no server as promised on the website, so we kept getting drinks at the bar), so I asked him to take the mic and get it fixed. After a while a girl comes in saying the microphone was dropped off on a random ledge, and that we wouldn't get my credit card back if that happened again!! Um, excuse me???? I told her the story and she said \"Never talk to the bar backs:\"...um, good to know. Someone brought a flask of alcohol, which is not allowed and they shouldn't have, and the bar back swiped it.\n\nAnyway, our machine was promptly shut off after our 3 hour window and we went to leave. One thing they fail to mention, is that if someone brings in a flask they charge you a $50 penalty fee. That's right, five zero. They also fail to mention that on top of your room charge of $100 dollars an hour, they charge you tax and 18% gratuity (we had little to no service, just an unfriendly guy taking empty cups after our multiple trips to the bar). So, all in, my humble $300 karaoke night out ended up costing $438.50 (not a single drink included in that price)\n\nI will never return to Pandora, as I know there HAVE to be better karaoke bars in the city with better song lists, less shady practices and nicer staff.", "author": "William d."}

Have fun, a few drinks, some grub and some vocal belt-ation.  \n\nThe truth of the matter is this:  \nReceptionists were very friendly and got us to our room promptly, albeit we were late for our reservation.\nThe interior design of the theme rooms are great.\nThe song selections, while spanning current hits and oldies, are limited. \nThe rooms are not sound insulated.\nThe rooms get uncomfortably hot.\nIn the private rooms, there's a constant static interruption from the wireless infared mics.\nThere's a very cool smoking area out back in between buildings.\nThe crowd is cool - most, like me, can't sing for sh!t, but cool and fun loving nonetheless.\nThe drink prices are very reasonable.\nService was at a good pace and very friendly.\n\nOverall, it was the company in the room that made up for the shortcomings of Pandora.  Good friends have great times.  The servers were fast, friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately there's only so much they can do about the poor karaoke set up in the room and the lack of a properly working cooling system.  The bar food was pretty good and the drinks are well priced.  Bottle service comes with complimentary soda and juice.  And the bar is well stocked.  \n\nIt was brought to my understanding that they are still in their Soft Opening stage.  Understandably, any new operation will have bugs that need to be addressed.  \n\nIf they keep the nice service attitude and fix the operational bugs, I will definitely, given the opportunity, give Pandora another shot and yelp accordingly.", "author": "G M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-24", "description": "We did not karaoke in the main room with the general public, so this review won't help you on that front, but if you are looking to book a private room, read on.\n\nAbout 15 of us celebrated my friend's birthday in the Peroni room. They have several rooms with different, mostly drink sponsored themes, although they do have a Hello Kitty room as well. Our room cost $50/hr + drinks and tip.\n\nThe rooms are cute, but flawed in their design. The monitors should be on the back wall, so the person singing can look out at the audience and sing to them. Unfortunately, a lot of the rooms have the monitor up in front, so you end up singing with your back to the audience. Our room had monitors on the side walls so we managed.\n\nThey do not give you books to go through, so instead of everyone being able to browse songs and pick in advance, you have to look through the computer at the front. And let me tell you, that computer was a bit of a pain. Not the most user friendly device in the world. And then you are separated from the rest of the party while you're looking for a song, and only one person can search at a time. Lousy system.\n\nThe song selection wasn't that great. Garth Brooks' \"Friends in Low Places\", a karaoke standard, wasn't there, nor was AC/DC's \"You Shook Me All Night Long\". Cee Lo's \"Fu*k You\" was though, which is somewhat recent. Perhaps they just keep it pop and urban? Not sure, but for a designated karaoke bar, I expect an incredible song selection.\n\nWe had a heck of a time getting service and several times had to go hunt down a waitress, even though we were told we'd have a dedicated server.  And not once during the whole night, did they ever clear away empty glasses. The upside to that is we have some pretty funny pictures of all the glasses stacked up in a tower. But still, they should have bussed the glasses.\n\nThe microphone's are tricky. If you touch them wrong (and let's face it, we're buzzed, we're probably not being super careful) they switch channels and people singing in the other rooms come through on your speakers. You're kind enough to listen to your own friends sing, you don't really want an echo from someone else's!  They said this was a bit complicated to fix and to just call them if it happened. We had to wait a good long time at one point before they came to fix it.\n\nAt the end of the night, they knocked off some of the charges on our bill for the trouble we had, but we weren't the only dissatisfied customers.  There was a group arguing loudly over their bill and the service they received and one guy said, \"This happens every night.\" Too bad they don't take the hint and make some changes to their entire system.\n\nIt might be fun to go karaoke there, but I wouldn't spend the money on a private room.", "author": "Indigo W."}

It's a cool place, as there are multiple-themed rooms to choose from, including the Hello Kitty room, Blue Moon room, Grey Goose room, etc. Lots of songs to choose from, ranging from English songs to Asian songs, from the computer system. In the lounge, there is a full bar, and a stage for those who want to perform in front of a crowd. It's a great place to go KTV! This is not your typical Asian KTV place; I've never seen so many White people singing KTV ^_^ This place is perfect to throw a birthday party. The more people, the merrier! Rent a large room, and get your vocals blaring out tunes like you're on The Voice or American Idol. If you sing outside in the lounge area, don some prop hats and other gag items to liven the experience. The only negativity about this place?

Comfy leather couches, great design, everything controlled by a touch screen pad (they have a mouse now for easier function, especially if you've had a few drinks).\nA full bar, with bottle service options at much cheaper than club prices YAY! It's very easy to turn the room into your personal club, if you pick the right songs ;) The VIP room with the pole will definitely help you with that! Giant flat screen TVs, top of the line equipment and song selection, yay Pandora! You can get a room that fits 10 people comfortably up to throwing a huge party for 50 people!\nThey have a full selection of food from Ahn (restaurant upstairs with the cool apple soju cups), ranging from sushi, japanese appetizers, to kimchee fried rice. Last time we were at pandora we ordered hella food, it was all really good. I had uni nigiri, we ordered bento boxes and soft shell crab, a lot of different rolls, it went so well with the goose LOL. Something about having a good food selection while drinking, makes the experience much better. If you eat enough you don't even get the 2am hunger craving!\nThe waitresses/bartenders are all nice and friendly.

We've tried a ton of spots around town, especially places w/ private rooms so trust me on this opinion. forreal, seriously, no lie.\n\nLiterally just left the spot about 20 minutes ago & feel the biggest need to review immediately.\n\nSo i had high hopes for this place. actually really excited a new karaoke spot opened around my hood & had so many good reviews already. it's thursday night. got there & it was looking good. new(er) interior, themed rooms which was different.. brownie points for that. i wanted the hello kitty room (of course), but it was taken. no biggie, we got the crown royal room instead which had a throne so hell yeah. i guess that's one of the smaller rooms, but it was still huge. and $50/hour. shet.. maaddd $$$$.. usually places will have different price ranges to accommodate different group sizes (playground is $35/hour, yamasho about $40-45/hour). they say groups of mere 2 should \"enjoy\" ourselves in the \"lounge\" area... but um, we like to sing in private, thanks. \n\nanyway, we went in knowing it was $50, but still wanted to give it a try since it's brand spanking new. and ok, i give them some slack that it's their \"soft opening\" blah blah, that's nice. but there are a few basic things that you expect from all karaoke places: COMPREHENSIVE song selection, EASE of browsing those songs, CORRECT lyrics to songs, & microphones that don't have crazy feedback even if you're near each other, let alone across the room from one another.  no to all of the above. \n\ntheir technology is impressive. big tv's w/ touch screen monitor to browse songs as opposed to the more common remote control and song books. at first it was oooh's and aaah's from us, but then waitaminute... how do you browse songs if you're NOT at the monitor? seeing that there's only ONE monitor, only ONE person at a time can look. and we all know it can take forever to find a song, if you didnt have one in mind already. godforbid there was more than two of us tonight. next, the screen was pretty dirty. my fingers got sticky & gnarly w/ gunk on the tips. they should think about investing in some stylus'. \n\ncarrying on... so if you're the lucky person at the monitor attempting to locate a song, good luck actually finding it. yes, you're able to search from multiple angles.. yes, there are multiple languages available, BUT song options to choose from are slim & few. \n\nthen, let's just say you're lucky again and were able to find that special song... 80/20 chance that there's going to be LYRICAL ERROR during that song.. actually, make that 100%. i think EVERY song had spelling mistakes and/or COMPLETELY WRONG LYRICS. i think they typed out the songs themselves because it was seriously off... all they had to do was google the lyrics, no?? cmon.. \n\nso lets say you knew alll the words to that special song you're singing by heart. awesome. and you want your friend/boyfriend/anyone to sing with you. duet. they pick up the mic and EEEEEEEEEEK feedback central. solo dolo it is. \n\nand cool, they've got some finger foods. great. nice girl takes our order. 15 minutes later comes in to check on us... no food. 10 minutes later, checks again.. we ask where the food is. she says, OH.. obviously forgot to put in the order. the food arrives another 10 minutes later (remember... this place is $50/hour) & it's the wrong order (well, one right, one wrong.. which is still wrong). we tell her. 5 minutes later, she comes back to apologize again, picks up empty beer bottles, ALONG w/ a basket (that contained correct food) that still HAS FOOD in it and takes it out. flustered much? WHAT THE CRAP. another 10 minutes later, other food order arrives. we dont even want it by then. aside from that, girl working there checked on us literally every 10-15 minutes. ok.. she's trying to be helpful & nice, but when you're in the middle of a song & trying to get into it, you really don't need/want interruptions. if we needed something, you would know. we would tell you. chill out, girlfriend. \n\nall right, all right.. so even after all that, i walked out of the room thinking i would give it three stars. but then after waiting 5 extra minutes to check out (bc no one was at the counter, and i was probably charged for), girlfriend smiles and tells us, we stayed 3 hours, but she'll charge us for 2.5. uh NO, we stayed for ALMOST 2 hours only. she calls manager, he does something and bill comes out to $173. this includes 18% gratuity ($24). WHAT? we were NOT told gratuity was included. undeserved. damn man.. after all the blunders & you being new.. not a good look, brah.\n\nin conclusion, NOT WORTH IT until they up their song options, get remotes, & spellcheck. if you really wanna go, bring a bunch of friends & take over the lounge. or better yet, check out YAMASHO. TONS of songs & less $ (and i used to think it's expensive). or head to japantown & hit up the korean spots. the one on geary rocks.", "author": "Yui K."}

I believe their defensive comments, sense of hostility and accusations illustrate my point in bullet #3 below. If you read many of the other reviews, you will find similar complaints and a downward spiral (see Yelp's comments graph)  Jeff -- I understand you may just be trying to keep your job at this point and CYA since it seems that you had a conversation with us that went against your company's own policies. We both know the situation you described is completely inaccurate nor does it add up. (However, I will note that your version of the story is quite comical!)  Regardless, your dishonestly is disheartening and unwarranted. Customers are not your adversaries. Good luck to you***** \n\nI recently visited Pandora Karaoke in celebration of a friend's birthday party for which we rented the \"Ciroc\" themed room for two hours ($50/hour). We worked with Kimmy in making the reservation, who was extremely responsive and helpful. I'd love to be able to give a great review of this place, but there are three main points which justify my one-star rating. \n\n1. The rooms are not as large as advertised. The \"Ciroc\" room that we were in was said to fit 20-25 people, however, with 15 normal sized individuals and were very cramped and  hot. I can't imagine for a second how 25 people would comfortably fit in that small space. I'm 5'6\", 135 lbs; 25 people of my size would have to sit on each other's laps (not my thing but to each their own. lol). \n\n2. As most folks have mentioned, the location is horrendous. When I get dressed up and go out for a night of fun, the last thing I want to do is walk down a dangerous urine-smelling street. To top it off, there is no parking in the area, so be prepared to dish out $20 for the lot, or, park on the street and ward off the scary characters that wonder that area. Ladies -- bring your pepper spray (or a big guy) when you walk in this area and do not leave ANYthing in your car. Disgusting and scary! \n\n3. My whole reason for writing this review is the poor service from staff - VERY unprofessional.  Management and the folks at the front door warrant some immediate customer service training.  When dealing with people and money, you've got to develop a high degree of emotional intelligence (Google that, Pandora) because you will undoubtedly encounter difficult situations. These folks completely lost their cool.  I felt like I was back in high school.  Management did nothing to diffuse or deescalate the situation.  In fact, they incited the drama!  Here's what happened:\n\nAfter purchasing bottle service for our party, spending even more money at the bar, plus the $50 per hour for the tiny room, we were given an impossible time when attempting to settle the bill.  What a hassle.  Apparently, a friend of the birthday girl brought her a bottle of Ciroc (her fav) as a gift, unbeknownst to any of us. Since outside alcohol is not allowed, after learning of the gift, the birthday girl made it a point to speak to Jeff, the manager, to inform him of the issue. He informed the birthday girl that he would have to take the bottle, but that he would not charge us any additional fees.  Fine with us since we had bottle service!  BUT, when it came time to settle the bill, Jeff did not honor his word and conveniently disappeared.  An additional fee was added and the bill required justification. After 30 mins of back and forth with the staff, Jeff finally showed up and completely denied his previous statement regarding the fee. Charming. To make matters worse, during the discussion, we were given a SECOND bill that was higher than the first, supposedly due to a billing mistake. HUH? I felt like I was in a circus (a scary one!) \n\nHonestly, if staff had been less defensive, more willing to listen to their customers, and left their attitudes at home, I would have settled whatever the balance was just to get out of there (I actually suggested that at one point, but their staff kept arguing!). I can't count the number of staff members  who kept switching in and out of the conversation after getting frustrated and just walking away (very professional, right), but who didn't even do as much as introduce themselves. Classy. \n\nSeriously, if you want a very positive experience, go to Press Club down the street. We started our night there before coming to Pandora, and I was given a complementary glass of wine while I waited, then later, a complementary bottle of champagne for the birthday girl (Christian, the manager at Press Club is  a class act! He's Fabulous!!). I don't go out looking for hand-outs, but when you're spending $100's of hard earned money at one establishment, it's nice to know that you are appreciated. \n\nIf you want to be treated poorly (or perhaps have a consultant that can perform  staff training on the spot. lol) then go to Pandora. I work too hard to waste money on an establishment that hates people", "author": "Kay R."}

The service was really good thanks waitress. It was a great room, but I agree with other reviews the karaoke system kinda blows. There was no remote control so you would need to climb to the front to pick songs, not many good songs, they didn't even have Color Me Bad, man what happened to the 90s!

The crowd was fun, too!\n\nThe one down side, and it's a big down side if you've been pre-gaming at a dive bar nearby like we were, and didn't have a chance to grab food, is there were very limited food options in the lounge. I don't know if you can order food in the private rooms, but I expected some type of food menu, since lots of private karaoke places have food in addition to drink options.  At the bar you can order Chairman Bao, which I would otherwise support (yay, local food carts) except that Chairman Bao doesn't have anything vegan (their vegetarian bao apparently has dairy). We were starving so I slipped out to the Indian restaurant on the corner and ordered some samosas and pakoras. The door man at first didn't want to let me in with them since they have a policy against outside food, but after I begged, told him I was vegan, and probably appeared to be close to a hangry meltdown, he radioed to the staff and they let me through that one time.\n\nI do agree the drink prices are too high ($5 for a bottle of Anchor Steam?!?).

My birhtday was about 2 weeks away at this point so I went to the bar to make the reservation in person.  They told me I can only make the reservation by email.  I had emailed atleast 6 times already with no response.  I let them know that and they showed no concern at all for my issue.  I went home an email again as instructed.  FINALLY I got an email back from a manager there named \"Jeff.\"  His wrote back to me \"F*ck that...you need to call.\"  Appauled, I called and asked to speak to him.  Of course they said he wasn't available.  I spoke to a female there who told me that I didn't need a reservation to just use the main area of the Karaoke Bar.  I really didn't want to use this place at all after that experience but it was now 3 days before my birthday and we had no other plans.  My guest and I arrived the night of my party and they would NOT let us in!!  Apparently they were \"full to capacity.\"  The attendant who I met before when I came there, would not even look at me.

I've been on both Fridays and Saturdays, and I've only visited the main lounge, not the private rooms.\n\nThe bar itself is great... I love the atmosphere, there are fun boardgames like candy land, the decor is nice, and the happy hour is SUPER cheap! Plus the drinks and the food are fine. The first time I came to this bar was on a Saturday and we had an all around great time! We sang a lot, there are fun props you can use, the selection of songs was decent, and we got a lot of drinks for super cheap. \n\nBut DO NOT GO ON FRIDAYS!!!!!! This was a distinctly different experience. The karaoke DJ on Fridays is just a total creep. He calls himself Ash Wednesday, he sings quite a few songs himself (is that really what they are paying him for?!), he will sing into his microphone while other people are trying to sing, instead of just playing the songs in the order that people signed up he picked out the ones that he wanted to hear, and he also brought with him a whole crowd of friends, most of them creepy as well and was having his friends sing an unproportional amount of the time (again, is this what they pay him for?!) Some of his friends were yelling at us and even videotaping us while we sang which made it really uncomfortable. At the end of the night he said \"Come again, come early, cum inside your girlfriend.\" I think that pretty much sums up how skeezy the whole thing felt.

I am used to paying $8 for the same amount and quality, maybe $10 TOPS.\n\nYou could use a credit card if you spend 20+ (but with $11 drinks that was not hard). \n\nAlso I noticed a bunch of security cameras, both inside and outside of the room.

Since I planned weeks in advance, I had no problem securing my first choice room (Crown Royal) on a Saturday night.\n\n***\n\nPROS:\n* The themed rooms are clever, modern, and most importantly -- clean!  I loved the Crown Royal room in particular because of its unique and distinguished purple throne.  Fit for the birthday princess (me)! \n* Service was great!  Our hostess helped us figure out the touch-screen in detail and patiently took food/drink orders from me and my 10 indecisive friends. \n* Food and drinks are relatively affordable.  Most bottles are about $100-$130. Depending on the number of people in your party, it may be cheaper to get bottles than to order individual shots. \n\nCONS:\n* Communication with Pandora's staff was not always coherent.  They don't always pick their phones (even during their business hours) and sometimes take days to respond to emails.\n* Pandora is located in the heart of the Tenderloin.  Need I say more? I wouldn't recommend getting there any other way but taxi or car.  Also, I suggest parking in the paid lots nearby.  [Note: The lot literally next door is the most expensive and closes the latest.  The one directly across the street is cheaper but closes at midnight.  If you're willing to walk about 1.5 blocks, look for the $10 flat rate sign.  They close at 3am.]\n* Dealing with the touch-screen was a pain.  Since the screen is located in the corner of the room, only 1-2 people can manage it at a time.  It's not like the other Japanese karaoke places where you can pass around that \"huge remote\" for song selections. \n* Music selection is very limited!  Everyone knows that Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin\" is the #1 karaoke song!  My friends and I were shocked to our very core that Pandora couldn't get the rights to this!\n\n***\n\nFor the most part, Pandora definitely helped make my birthday memorable and stress-free.  It's a fun place to go to for group celebrations, and is probably one of the few karaoke bars in the Bay Area that has a license to serve alcohol to the private rooms.  However, for a random/just-because karaoke night, I would stick to Do Re Mi or SF Town Music in Japantown.", "author": "Judy C."}

The bottom line is that this would be a good venue for larger private parties where money is not an issue.  \n\nThe GOOD:\n\n-The mics are cordless and you can hear yourself crystal clear (TIP: to minimize feedback noise, do not hold the mics at the bottom)\n-There is a \"public\" karaoke area adjacent to the bar\n-There is a bar\n-The rooms are themed and shiny and new (for now)\n-The staff is friendly and responsive\n\nThe BAD:\n\n-It's all about the Benjamins, baby.  The rooms are pricey on their own, but they also charge tax and gratuity.  They also have bottle service on the menu that is $100+.  Keep in mind they only hold reservations for ten minutes (according to the person who booked our reservation via e-mail).\n-The song selection console doesn't have a very user-friendly interface.  The artists, for whatever reason, are not listed alphabetically, and there doesn't seem to be a way to fast forward.  Being able to create a user ID and save playlists is a nice idea, should you decide to return to Pandora.\n-The layout, at least for the Harmonics room, is poorly thought out, in that it is difficult for people to move around what with a huge stationery table in the center, and people cannot select songs remotely from where they are seated.\n-The bathroom, unlike the karaoke rooms, appears to have been an afterthought.", "author": "Jenn C."}

While I liked the concept of the private karaoke rooms and it was a very clean bar, it had some problems in execution. \n\n-Customer service was not so good.  The cocktail waitress was sparse and did not check on us regularly or did  she clear off the table which by the end of the night became so full of classes it was piled high. Yuk!\n-Karaoke system and song selection is done on a computer with a mediocre interface.  They do not have books to search for songs but instead have one monitor by the singer to search songs which is tough when someone is singing.  I think part of the fun of karaoke is many people searching the books and writing down their songs.  It's also a lot easier to search a book.\n-Song selection was sparse and we could not find many songs people wanted to sing.  \n-Sound system was not adjusted properly.  It sounded flat and one mic had problems a lot.  After several attempts to have someone look at it and probably at least an hour passing a technical person finally came in and adjusted it correctly.  They should have adjusted the system before we came into the room.   \n-Lack of communication about the rooms.  I rented the room until 1 pm and was told you can usually stay in it until 2 pm if no one else wants it with no charge.  No one came in at 1 pm to see if I wanted to extend or communicate if I needed to pay or not.   While they did credit me 30 minutes for the sound problems I was charged the extra hour.   \n\nWhile this is a great idea and could be a really great experience, I think they would need to actually put someone in charge and make it their job to ensure your experience is great.  Training of the staff in customer service would be recommended.  Also the bouncer at the end of the night was not very friendly.  While he does have a tough job, we were an older tame group, but were treated pretty rough and yelled at to leave and we were still waiting for the bill.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-11", "description": "Went to Pandora this evening with my husband and three friends. We love karaoke, and were used to the 'whole bar' style rather than the private room style - the whole concept seemed like a luxury and a really great idea. We like to sing, and we like to sing a lot.\n\nBefore I explain the two star rating, I will say that I had a good time. However, I feel like it was because of some fantastic company, and not the venue.\n\nIssues:\n\n1. Audio quality. As mentioned in some other reviews, the audio quality is wildly inconsistent. One of our microphones was set so hot that there was constant feedback, regardless of how it was held; we had to turn it off and just use the other. The songs were not consistent, volume-wise, so we had to adjust the song volume constantly. When we entered the room, the volume was so loud we couldn't hear the waitress that brought us in, and the screens were set to a loop of Eminem & Rihanna - Love the Way You Lie (which may be the most odious song in the history of music).\n\n2. Venue sketchiness. The room we were in was the 42Below room, which was quite nice and comfortable. The rest of the facility - in particular the hallways and bathrooms - seemed shabby and unfinished, if not actually dirty. (As an example, instead of building a cabinet or wall around what appears to be a water heater or furnace, there was a little folding room divider in front of it.)\n\n3. Song selection interface. The touchscreen idea is nice, but several improvements are necessary to make it nice in more than concept. First, rather than being affixed to the wall, the screen needs to be something that can be passed around. Tethered is fine - put it in the middle of the table, and then we're not all climbing over one another to pick songs. Second, the interface needs to be more reliable and responsive. The touchscreen was laggy and unpredictable, and obviously desirable functions like search were buried or worked in ways not intuitive to anyone who's used a computer in the last ten years. Third, the songs absolutely need to be properly listed with fully filled-in metadata - there were lots of songs that were on the 'new releases' list that were by artists who couldn't be found via search or other lists, and there was heavy presence of other-language songs in the English list. Fourth, some settings ought to be selectable as a global - so you can (for example) set the list to only show English songs for the night.\n\n4. Song selection. For all the boasting of a huge song list, we weren't finding a lot of songs that are total karaoke standards. In fairness, this might have been due to interface and metadata fail. In any case, we were wrestling with finding songs that we felt should have been there most of the night.\n\n5. Visuals. If there's no real music video for the song, then just play over a black screen instead of 70s stock footage that was later recycled as deodorant and/or menstrual product ads.\n\n6. Prices. And yes, ok, this is a tiny thing. I was drinking sodas, and they were $4 a pop. If we weren't already paying just to be there, that might have seemed more reasonable, but getting shafted on soda while paying a premium for the room is obnoxious. The crew I was with drank beer all night, and got buckets - 6 beers for $25 - so I was paying almost as much for a soda as they did per beer. What gives?\n\nWe had a good time, but we're going to shop around for other places to ease off the frustration factor next time.", "author": "Erica T."}

Nothing like this I've seen in the city... and it's great now I have another option for my weekend festivities. \n\nUnlike all the other korean karaoke spots in the city that look like a sneeze away from falling apart... this place is sleek and modern! They also have a great amenity.... a BAR! Located in the center of Pandora. And then walking more to the back there is the hallway of private, themed karaoke rooms. Haha.. a bar was already a winner for me. No more sneaking my drinks in a brown paper bag stuffed in my purse. Back to the themed rooms... they have the Heineken room... Ciroc room... Blue moon room... among many other beverage inspired rooms. Thers is also a very roomy VIP that looks like it can fit over 20+ people comfortably... great for throwing a next bday party when I don't feel like going to the club. But my favorite of all the rooms is the Hello Kitty room! So cute! Pink and white! A bow on the bench to add a touch of my favorite cat... so sweet! This is always going to be reserved for me on my girls night out! Love it. Addition to that they have a touch screen panel to choose songs which makes the karaoke experience a bit more high tech. But what matters most to me is the videos. The music videos are the actual videos of the songs! Now I don't have to look at random scenery and girls from the year 1991 standing there doing nothing...

This was my time there and had no idea what to expect.  We were escorted downstairs and my friend paid for a private room.  When you first walk in, there's a public area where peeps were simply doin' way too much.  They were so drunk and loud.  WOW!  Is this what straight people do on Saturday nights in the ghetto?  Anyhow, we were escorted to our private room.  As we walked through the matrix of halls, the rooms were open.  I noticed they're all beer/alcohol themed.  One room was a Miller room, the other Budweiser, and another Jameson.  We ended up in the Blue Moon hefeweizen room.  It was hot inside and looked cheap.  They had 2 fans to keep us cool.  I couldn't believe it.  It wasn't like fans in the wall like a/c.  It was like \"hey the a/c is broke.  Let's go to Walmart and buy fans.\"  Then there was new paint on sections that were obviously covering graffiti.  The seats were either really bad/old leather or they were vinyl.  The seats actually reminded me of the vinyl type seats in an old school bus.  Just cheap looking and feeling.  The waitress for our room was pretty and nice.  She busted out a menu of drinks and they didn't have any champagne.  I mean really?  Bottle Service?  Private Room?  They only served stuff like Jager and other dive bar type alcohol.  To be honest, the place was just gross and I didn't feel safe there.  Everything was so pumped up to be nice, but it was really all just hot air.  I stayed for like 10 minutes and then bounced out.  The whole thing was just tacky.  If you're 21 and never experienced anything nice, then you'll probably love this place.", "author": "Shaun W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-09-20", "description": "I went to Pandora a few weeks ago with a group of friends and friends-of-friends.  Here's the scoop:\n\nPROS: (1) The place looks great.  I really liked the concept of the theme rooms.  My party started in the Crown Royal Room and had to move to the Heineken Room (see CONS below for explanation), and both were very visually appealing.  The throne in the Crown Royal room is a particularly nice touch.  (2) Even the smaller rooms were large enough for our group of 12; no cramming everyone in.  (3) A good percentage of the videos were actually the original videos by the artists (almost unheard of in karaoke land).\n\nCONS: (1) The English song selection is shockingly poor, much worse than any other karaoke place I've visited in the Bay Area.  They had scarcely more than 1,000 English songs, a list that omitted many karaoke standards.  A number of people in our party couldn't find the top several of their go-to karaoke songs on the list.  (2) The touch screen song selector, although cool-looking, was confusing to operate.  (3) Since only one person could use the touch screen at a time and, unlike most karaoke places, there were no books of songs for others to review, song selection was slow.  (4) The sound system in the Crown Royal Room did not work; we could not use both mikes without feedback.  Only after several ill-fated attempts to fix the problem over about an hour and an express request to move rooms did they move us to the Heineken Room, which did have better sound.  They should have moved us right away, without our having to ask.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  I had high hopes for Pandora.  While everyone in my group enjoyed spending time together, I go to karaoke to sing my favorite songs and, on that score, I was disappointed.  I'm not likely to return until I hear that their song selection is dramatically improved.", "author": "Andrew B."}
