While she doesn't speak English, she made sure our teapot stayed full and that we had everything we needed.\n\nWe order the beef wrap, pork dumplings in chili oil, black bean sauce noodles, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. The beef wrap and noodles were great! We also really liked the dumplings in oil (just the right level of spice and flavor) and pan fried dumplings (watch out - these guys were juicy AF). The XLB was fine for the price but it was the most average dish of the evening for us.\n\nThe total came out to be about $45 after tax and we had leftovers. I would definitely recommend this place!", "author": "Grace C."}

The secret is to order off the chef's specialty menu. The first thing I order is the XLB, if the restaurant has on their menu, then I proceed to see what appeals to me. We ordered their hand pulled noodles with braised beef and the twice cooked pork belly. The hand pulled noodles alone is worth the trip to this restaurant, if you have never experienced hand pulled noodles, it's definitely worth a try, you may get hooked like I have.  Then the twice cooked pork belly, this is not prepared the cantonese style with the persevered mustard greens, but braised in a dark soy in big chunks and served with shanghai bock choy. Yum and double yum!\nFor the price, I think the dishes were a little small, but due to food cost etc. that may be the norm now. I think the noodle dish could have been at least a little more substantial. All and all worth a try.", "author": "Raymond L."}

It might be (somewhat) healthier food now, but it was unexpected, in a good way. You still get the sweet notes (with tang from the orange peel), but there's an extra layer of flavor to the crispy chicken now. I definitely suggest giving these revamped dishes a try.", "author": "Timmy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-25", "description": "This place is so much better than Shanghai Dumpling King was (permanently closed/sold from across the street). I'm saying so much better because the dumplings and noodles are all made with dough kneaded by hand and ingredients are fresh. Textures were just right: fluffy and chewy for dumplings, crispy but soft for beef wrap. We ordered (whimsically) beef wraps for appetizer, dumplings per craving, and eggplant for some veggie relief.\n\nSide note: Not sure why this is classified as a Szechuan Chinese restaurant on Yelp - it's clearly stated Beijing style on the windows of the restaurant - but Szechuan styles sound trendier. Beijing and northern Chinese cooking is what you want in a dumpling or noodle house. These were the traditional staple foods for northern Chinese.", "author": "S J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-26", "description": "If you look at a map of China you'll notice it's a massive country, with numerous geographic regions, each with their own cuisine. Believe it or not, you can subdivide those regions even further into an almost innumerable variety of regional cuisines. It's where two regions (and their unique cultures) overlap that you find some of the most magical food.\n\nWe came to the Richmond in search of Shanghainese food, and we found an even more specific variation of that cuisine, with influences of the Muslim culture from the western part of China, here at Village House. \n\nAs with most great Chinese eats in the US, you've gotta look past the recognizable items on the menu and dig to uncover the unique specialties of the house. I've gotten to the point where I can trust my gut (literally and figuratively) and we selected several dishes that let the true regionality shine including: \nShredded Pork with Bean Curd Skin, Ro Ja Moa (aka Chinese \"Hamburger\"), Cumin Lamb, Hot and Sour Potato, Chao Bing (stir fried shredded pancake with beef and bean sprouts), AND hand folded lamb and zucchini dumplings. \n\nHard to pick a favorite from that lineup because they all had their own unique merits, but I think I fell in love with the dish that sounds the simplest... hot and sour potato. Chinese chefs are masterful with their cleaver, and to julienne a potato by hand is no small feat. The uniformity in the cutting and cooking was truly impressive, and the sour and spicy sauce made this simple dish a beautiful marriage of flavor and texture that perfectly interrupted some of the richer dishes on the table. \n\nI'd have to say my second favorite was the shredded pork with bean curd skin. The shredded pork is coated in a glistening sweet sauce and set atop a pile of sliced cucumbers and bean sprouts, garnished with fresh cilantro and surrounded by squares of bean curd skin. As with many Chinese dishes, elements combine flavors and textures for the perfect bite, and in this one, the pork is so tender delicate that the bean curd adds in the chew while the veggies add in some freshness. \n\nLastly, you can't help but notice the prep area dedicated to dumplings here. These aren't the intricate Cantonese dim sum dumplings you might've enjoyed elsewhere, but rather these are simple, handmade, and comforting dumplings, quickly boiled and served with black vinegar for dipping. They seem to make them by the bushel, almost to order, and you should absolutely try them when you're here.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with this cuisine, I'd suggest repeating our order because it really hits some high notes. We were a party of three and ordered enough food for six, and yet our bill was still only $30/pp with tax and tip. I craved these flavors for the next few days. Absolutely delicious, unique, and impressively affordable.", "author": "Michael T."}

Service was ok too. I Feel bad for the worker. He did everything while I assumed the owner and two others behind the counter didn't help when busy.

The proprietor/manager (\"Clark\"?) was very welcoming and attentive, bringing out hot tea while I looked at the menu. Ordered a pork bun and egg and tomato soup for lunch. The pork bun was hot, freshly made with lots of filling. The egg and tomato soup came a few minutes later, and although dangerously hot  at first, smelled delicious with noodles at just the right consistency. It stayed warm through to the end and I finished very satisfied and full. Would recommend during off hours, will have to check out again. Thanks!", "author": "Jay B."}

We ordered an assortment of dishes (boiled dumplings, beef noodle soup that had tasty \"handmade\" noodles but barely any beef, green onion pancake that was fantastic, Chinese hamburger which was a little odd with too much of the bun, green beans which were probably the highlight) that were all OK to pretty tasty, (except for the soup dumplings which were fairly meh with 5 out of 6 dumplings not having any soup in them and the skin being really thick).\n\nThe service was friendly and quick but what threw me off was at the end, the waiter came by and asked for our table to all give 5-star Yelp reviews and return we'd get 10% off our check.  The Yelp check-in already gives 10% off and I don't like the feeling of a business trying to \"buy\" my rating.  Minus one star for that shadiness - I think a much better approach would have been to let us know that they are a newer establishment and ask us to review them on Yelp - I would have happily rated them 4 stars even without the discount.  So if you see 5-star reviews here that are super short (and could have been typed out on a mobile phone), chances are they could have been bribed :-/", "author": "Mengo Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-15", "description": "Playing Muni Roulette on Market Street yesterday, I decided to jump on the 31 Balboa to check out Village House (\u9109\u6751\u98ce\u5473). I was probably drawn there by the fact thaat a Yelper had mentioned a \"Chinese hamburger\" and (correctly) assumed it was a roujiamo, but since it was past 5:00 when I got there I decided to make that the appetizer to  an early dinner. The young woman server was eager to promote the house-made xiaolong bao, dumplings (jiaozi) and noodles, so I ordered a basket of XLB and a lamb dumpling and noodle soup as my mains.\n\nThe roujiamo (\"Chinese Hamberger\" on the menu) was on the small side, but heck, it cost all of  $2.95. The panbread bun was about the right thickness, browned but not greasy, though a bit less dense than some versions. The meat filling was appropriately porky and salty in flavor, though the texture seemed wrong because  it was coarsely chopped (loin?) instead of stewed, so the sandwich was a bit dry as well.\n\nI don't know if they knew what they were getting into, boasting about their house-made xiaolong bao in earshot of both Shanghai Dumpling King and Shanghai House, but they didn't embarrass themselves.  Their XLB is probably better than the last I had at SDK, but not quite as good as I remember Shanghai House's to be (though I haven't been to either of these places in a long time). The wrappers were delicate, and the soup ample, though they need to push the needle away from the salty side of the dial a bit toward the sweet side. But then, those were Beijingese voices floating around the room, not Shanghainese.\n\nThe soup was hearty, with six lamb dumplings and a long ton of noodles.  The dumplings were meaty but not particularly lamb-y (but I'd like try them again, outside of soup, to be fair). The noodles were springy and fresh, if not hand pulled. The broth seemed under-seasoned, particularly lacking salt, of all things. Since there was no salt shaker of the condiment tray, I used a bit of soy sauce along with chili paste to sex it up.\n\nThe menu contains a lot that will be of interest to fans of Northern Chinese style \"dim sum.\" Chao bing was mentioned by a previous reviewer (in fact Village House has four versions), and they also have such relative rarities as sweet and savory shao bing (saobing), jian bing guozi, ji dan guan bing and doufu nao (which I'll definitely be back soon to try). In addition to other, more familiar  Northern Chinese fare, Village House's menu is augmented with a smattering of Shandong, Shanghainese, Xi'an, Sichuan and Xinjiang offerings.", "author": "Gary S."}

All of them were good and comparable to other Chinese restaurants I've been to and the prices are reasonable.  There is no complaints about the service as the same waiter is very attentive, constantly refilling my tea cup or making sure the hot water in my teapot is hot.  This is a small restaurant that seats at best (maximum 25 people).  At least for lunch, there is no waiting.  They also offer take-out and credit card charge is allowed only if  your bill is greater than $20.", "author": "cynthia n."}

We ordered the egg with tomato noodle soup, the chicken and chive dumplings, the braised tofu, and the xiao long bao. Everything tasted great and was delicious. The service was also good. The waitress checked in on us asking if the food was good which was nice and one of the cooks who I think is the owner was even nice enough to come out and refill my tea. He even gave us a free sesame red bean pancake as a dessert. We're definitely coming back to try some of the other delicious looking food on their menu.", "author": "Gabriel H."}

Yes, I've been here that many times since they opened about a year ago and not just because I live just six blocks away.  Lots of nearby restaurants, but this place is my favorite.  Spicy dumplings, I get these almost every time.  Xiao long bao is probably the best I've had anywhere in the city.  The soups are all excellent - I especially love the boiled fish with Sichuan pickles (perfect combination of spicy and sour) - and a side order of delicious hand-pulled noodles can be added to any of them.  And then there's the hot chili oil dishes - beef, lamb, or fish - these are amazing!  The oil is clean and perfectly spiced.  (We always take the extra oil home for cooking our own dishes.)  I don't care about decor or service - both are just fine, by the way - but the food is great.  Try anything.  Try everything.  You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Christopher B."}

This place is a diamond in the rough to have on Balboa.  Many thanks to the owners/staff who run the place now.  Curteous, quick and thoughful and with interesting menu and nice paper Chinese tales of dumpling and soup on the walls.  It is a Village House type simplicity replete with the classic linoleum and fluorescent lighting sf is known for :)).  House made Xiao Long Bao is ordered almost every time.  Chinese hamburger and pot stickers also good and fried but clean.  Bean paste with noodle is refreshing with raw veggies and satisfying with the pork bean paste and noodle (not house made noodle for this one but?).  The kung pao chicken is a sensation with the chili oil, whole peanut, celery, green pepper, onion, and a haunting after bite that leaves a tingle.  Numb face lamb soup at Mission Chinese only other place I've tried that has the same spice.  The soups come hot and do not taste like they have been cooked in multi dish oils or water and to top off the list are three other really good/great dishes on the menu:  the egg chow mein, the cumin lamb (double yup) and the Boiled Fish with Szhuan Pickles (two thumbs up in the air for this one) - this dish is a new must have and fave for me and I'm a caucasian who doesn't branch far in the seafood selections - food for two and a deep but light broth with white fish and big white hunks of tofu - thick but creamy and a delight.

The gal who served us (young gal with glasses) was really nice and attentive and service was great. We had the following dishes:\n\n(1) braised beef noodle soup. I really loved the broth. It's not as salty as other restaurants which I like. Tons of flavor, the noodles were chewy and fresh, and the beef was pretty lean and so tender! \n\n(2) pork and shrimp and chive dumplings. So good! And the meat is already seasoned perfectly so I wouldn't recommend dipping these in soy sauce or any kind of sauce, just eat them plain. The wrapper was homemade and fresh. \n\n(3) xlb. Another winner! Delicate light and full of flavorful soup, just how good xlb should be. \n\n(4) green onion pancakes. Crispy fried on the outside, doughy and chewy on the inside, just delicious. \n\n(5) steamed red bean bun.

When we couldn't find parking for Hong Kong Lounge, we decided to come home and walk a block to Village House. It was, in a word, disappointing. The dumplings were very doughy and bland. The fillings were also pretty tasteless.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-06", "description": "After the previous (and my favorite) dim sum place at this location closed, I was fairly apprehensive about Village House when it opened. When I first walked in I was pleasantly surprised to find that they make all their dim sum fresh, right up front for everyone to see. The atmosphere of the place is nice as well. It's small, quiet, clean and pleasantly decorated. The staff is courteous and more than willing to answer any questions you may have. The size of the menu is decent for a place like this, but what's on the menu is fairly uninspired. There isn't much you won't find at any other generic Chinese-American restaurant. The real question is... is the food any good? \n\nI have been to Village House half a dozen times over the span of a few weeks to try and get a sense of quality and consistency. Unfortunately, they are one of the most inconsistent restaurants I have ever experienced. The dim sum has ranged from absolutely outstanding to a doughy, under-seasoned mess. the chicken dumpling with green chives is the only one that really blew my mind. The potstickers, which are typically one of my favorite dishes, were a total disappointment. They charge $5.95 for 4 doughy, flavorless pockets of disappointment. I can go to any number of other dim sum places and get 3 for around $2. The spicy dumplings, which were recommended to me as their most popular dish tasted okay, but made me feel ill later that day. Also, more than one my dishes were swimming in oil, which somewhat ruined it for me. Out of curiosity I tried the Chinese hamburger. It's simple and delicious. I just wish it had more filling. I would recommend it as a late-afternoon snack to anyone walking by looking for a quick bite to eat. My biggest complaint about this place isn't actually about the quality of the food it's the fact that everything is made to order, which in this case is actually a detriment to their business model. Dim sum restaurants are supposed to be fast and have small portioned, good quality dumplings at affordable prices. Village House doesn't really offer that. The prices are too high for the quality of food they provide and because everything is made to order, you have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes for even a single order of dim sum. I haven't tried any of their soups yet and I have seen quite a few people ordering it when they eat in the restaurant. They look quite good and I look forward to trying them. Although my experiences with Village House have not been the best so far, I will go again to try different things and see if their consistency improves. \n\nOverall I believe Village House has the potential to be a great, local dim sum place, but at this point I wouldn't recommend ordering any of the actual dumplings. It is a good place to bring a date for a small meal before seeing a movie at the theater down the street. It's a quiet and pleasant experience, even if the food is subpar.", "author": "Chris S."}

Once I was inside, I was charmed by a two-year old happily being doted upon by the people working there.  How could I resist?  It was like coming inside a family's home.  I was coming from a place of not being quite sure what to order. I placed myself at the cashier's mercy.  She made a recommendation and I simply went along.  They brought me tea which a gentleman kept checking several times to make sure it was still warm.  (Could this gentleman be the child's grandfather)?  When the food came it was amazing.  It was spicy lamb that was out of this world.  When the cashier noticed I was enjoying my meal she gave me a big smile and \"thumb's up!\".  The food was so good that I ordered a \"Flaming spicy lamb\" dish to take home to my wife. She had it the next day and loved it as well.\nI would recommend Village House to anyone who would enjoy the feeling of walking into a family's kitchen and feeling right at home.  They were very gracious and the food was excellent in being both savory and spicy.  This is proof that we are so fortunate to live in a City that has a rich diversity of cultures that allow us to enjoy a very special restaurant as Village House.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-31", "description": "I was a huge fan of Jook Time for their cheap, huge selection of dim sum so I was really sad to see it go. I was very wary when I saw a much bigger seating selection while Village House was remodeling, worried that it wouldn't have dim sum options and was purely a sit down place. However, it's looking like they're doing ready to go dim sum, at least a bit! It's definitely more of a sit down place and their ready made food is a little lacking in selection, but it's there and I'm hoping they expand on it more. \n\nRegardless, I've been there a couple times now and it's been pretty good! I was again worried that it would be a copycat of Shanghai Dumpling King across the street, but their menu is different enough that it works on its own. So far I've tried the chinese hamburger, ready made and fresh made pork dumplings, ready made fried rice, green onion pancake and beef pancake. The chinese hamburger was a little dry, but the flavor was definitely there! It's a bit spicy too. I feel like the buns were what was making it dry, as they were a bit thick and dense. I wasn't a huge fan of the ready made pork dumplings. They felt a bit bland to me, but somehow the ones I ordered that were made fresh were much better. Perhaps it was because they were hot? When I ordered the green onion pancake I thought it would be the usual fried dough with green onions, but this was instead a fried dough filled with fresh veggies and green onion! It was -very- good and you get a lot. I think bits of the dough weren't cooked completely, but I honestly didn't mind in the slightest. I love the very slightly underdone texture. The premade fried rice was very bland but I liked the addition of pineapple to it. I just threw in a bit of salt when I got home and it was better. The beef pancake has to be my favorite so far, though. It's the same kind of green onion pancake dough but wrapped almost crepe style around green onion, various green veggies, beef, cilantro and a really tasty sauce. \n\nPricewise it's pretty standard. Prices range between $2.50-$10. With how downhill Shanghai Dumpling King has been feeling, it's nice to have a good lunch option for a similar price point. \n\nThey don't have any music playing, but everyone is very friendly and the wait times for food aren't super long! I've only ever done take out, but I'd like to sit down at some point and see how it goes. Definitely needs music, though. It was pretty quiet in there.  \n\nOverall I definitely recommend it! I'm knocking off a star for the fairly bland premade food, but I have high hopes for the rest of the menu!", "author": "Benny G."}
