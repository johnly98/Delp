Pretty standard for an ice cream shop. But then you realize that they have 30 gazillion flavors, and that their unusual flavors are flavors that they could've only made up. \n\nWe had the Four Cs (cherry, champagne, chocolate, and coffee) and a banana split with weird flavors: Star Wars, peanut butter Oreo, and jasmine (I'm so bad at matching ice cream because I just want to try everything). The Four Cs was probably our favorite because it had real cherry pieces and you could taste all 4 flavors separately and at different times. It was not only unique but it was done so well! The jasmine was soooo flavorful that I felt like I was eating a flower. It was wonderful! The Star Wars and peanut butter Oreo were tasty too. \n\nSome other noteworthy things:\n         -the employees are very friendly!\n         -they give you huge scoops\n         -the yelp check in offer is great!!\n         -they play cool music \n\nI have nothing bad to say about Polly Ann. It was an amazing experience and I left in a better mood than when I came in. Can't wait to come back to get my ice cream fix!", "author": "Claire C."}

I went to middle school across the block at AP Giannini Middle School so I've been coming here for many years. This is the first time I've been treated SO BADLY!\nMe and a group of friends came here on a Wednesday night, there was barely anyone here. We proceeded to ask for, at most, two samples each. At my second sample request, an older Asian lady employee or maybe owner, tells me to hurry up and order because we've asked for too many samples. I was so taken back, that I couldn't say anything. Me and my friends had even shared samples earlier to be considerate. \nThere was no sample limit on display, nor did anyone tell us there was any sample limit. We decided to avoid any problem and continued to order our flavors. However, as we walked out, my friend bit into a piece of large plastic! So not only did the lady rant about us as we were walking out, she never apologized for the piece of health hazard that my friend almost ate! \n\nI will never be coming back.

You can also spin the wheel and try your luck (they let you pick the flavors between the number it lands on and 1 to the right and left, respectively). \n\nMy absolute favorites at this point are jasmine tea, macupono, and taro. Many flavors also contain real pieces of the food, fruit, or nut of your chosen flavor (notable examples: taro, macupono, walnut/hazulnut).\n\nStaff at Polly Ann's is also always friendly and patient. They are even willing to accommodate requests. Case in point, they recently removed single split scoops in a cone from their menu. They don't advertise it, but if you are willing to get your single scoop in a cup, you can still get 2 flavors. They will also top it with a basic cone (sugar or wafer) for free if you ask. Best of both worlds!

First of all, they have almost 50 flavors to choose from, which is so difficult for indecisive people like me.

There's an offer for a free cookie or waffle cone with a Yelp check-in, except there's also a $5 minimum purchase to receive it thus me getting a double scoop instead of single. I'm not complaining though since both flavors were absolutely amazing. I loved how fragrant they infused the flavors with the florals in the Jasmine and the true bitterness of matcha in the green tea. When you can taste the bitterness of the matcha, you know you have legit green tea --yum!\n\nThere's plenty of candies and drinks to also purchase here.

Cute little ice cream shop with good ice cream, I wouldn't go out of my way to come all the way here from where I live but if I was in the neighborhood it would certainly be a place to stop by.", "author": "Peter P."}

I even did a fundraiser with them when I was class treasurer in high school and I really appreciated the support! I do have to say their flavors used to be a lot better, notably the green tea and the durian, which just aren't the same as they used to be. However, they still make the best lychee ice cream I've ever had, and their sesame is great too. The red bean ice bars are delicious and chock full of real red beans. On Tuesdays, they have discounted pre-packed ice cream ($6.95 instead of the usual $7.95) and popsicle boxes ($2.00 instead of $2.50), so this is when my family goes to pick up some treats. The young guy at the counter was very nice both on the phone when I called to confirm discount Tuesdays, and later in person when we were purchasing the ice cream (2/6/18 evening).

The young lady at the counter that night was so sweet to offer my sister water and another flavor to sample just to get that nasty taste out of her mouth. We laughed so hard though, we still talk about it months later.\n\nService is amazing, especially considering how they've got to deal with so many loud children barging in, yelling out their orders and getting on a sugar high just from being there.

They don't dye their Jasmine Tea ice cream flavor here to purple, as I've seen in many other ice cream shops...which is MUCH appreciated. \n\nMy only qualm about Polly Ann's is that they rarely have the Jasmine Tea pre-made in the buy and takeout fridges.

The ice cream was fairly smooth, but reminded me more of ice cream I make from my ice cream maker. I did like the strong spicy ginger taste. The other flavors we tried felt a little fake in terms of flavor meaning a bit chemically. It also wasn't too far from the pints you get from 99 Ranch which is where I've had them before.\n\nWith the Yelp Check-in you can get a free waffle cone.

Maybe this sounds a little scary but luckily all the flavors sound good. :) \n\nTwo of us split a single scoop of toasted almond (after losing the spin game lol) and it was plenty enough and plenty yummy. $3.50 for a single scoop & cash only for orders under $5.

Definitely subtle. Not overly sweet. I wasn't too much of a fan of this one compared to the other ones, but this was still pretty good. Which shows how much better the others one were.\n\nMintie Oreo Cookie- The mint was gooddddd. And if you love Oreo Cookie, you most definitely must get this! The oreo cookie is infused in the mint and the mint makes you wake up and loveeeeee the flavor.\n\nCCC- I had chocolate. I only remember chocolate. I remember there being chunks but I forget what exactly what was in it. Don't be me. Don't inhale it. This was by far the best of the three :) Would recommend!\n\nThey also give doggie cones (I remember seeing that in 2008 or 2009). \n\nIf you are indecisive, there is a wheel. Spin it. Whatever you land on, that's your flavor. You can't change your mind!\n\nWith a Yelp check in, you get a free upgrade to a cone :) or a free cookie.

But in-store -- this is my 2nd time here and it just.doesn't cut it.  Last time I had your basic chocolate chip and it was just \"ok.\".  This time I had a scoop of lychee, which tasted like it was from the bottom of the container, not fresh, not creamy, and nothing like the prepacked tubs I've gotten.  I also had Thai Tea which was not at all sweet and even was a bit bitter.

The line was out the door and we thought man this must be good.  With a lot of flavors on the board and no repeats, we were overwhelmed with what kind of flavor we should get.  We ordered a double scoop in a waffle cone compliments of a yelp check in and chose three flavors--almond fudge, rum raisin and pistachio almond. \n\nThe portions were huge and for the price we felt like the quantity was there.  Service was nice but slow. We must have waited approximately 30 minutes in line and I imagine it is because there's two people scooping ice cream and many guests probably ask to try a ton of flavors.  One thing I did not like is how the people serving ice cream both touch money and go back to serving.  \n\nThere's a few tables for inside seating but they were all full when we were there.  We opted to eat our ice cream in the car as eating on the sidewalk just didn't sound like fun to us.\n\nNow onto the ice cream flavors. \n\nThe strongest flavor was the rum raisin. The least flavorful was probably the pistachio almond.  The consistency of the ice cream was creamy but tasted \"icy\" and like it was stored in the freezer for awhile. \n\nParking can be disastrous in this area, but if you're willing to walk a few blocks here you can park in the neighborhoods.

It was almost like a finely chopped sno-cone - like it had thawed and was refrozen.  I then tasted my husbands and it was nice and creamy.  I told the gentleman helping us that I was unhappy with my ice cream - it was not creamy and had the texture of ice.  I then ordered their version of rocky road.  Totally different texture (creamy). When he handed me the new cone, I tried to give him the reject.  He told me I could keep it since he was charging me for both!  I was shocked!  He said since I had tasted it before ordering, I would have to pay for it.  I told him I had not tasted the ice cream before ordering it and he said I would still have to pay for it.

I was totally puzzled and pointed to him a bunch of them (20+ green-color \"green tea\" labeled quart size boxes) in the freezer.

Now the only song I knew the lyrics to at the time was Blood, Sweat & Tears' \"Spinning Wheel\"... \"What goes up must come down / Spinning wheel gotta go 'round...\" I barely got to the chorus when they stopped me and told me to apply to the food services area. That was the end of my Grammy-winning aspirations, but I managed a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when I saw the spinning wheel behind the counter at Polly Ann (photo: http://bit.ly/12Z0E4n). \"Talking about your troubles it's a crying sin / Ride a painted pony, let the spinning wheel spin...\"\n\nJamie W. and I came here after an all-day road trip we took up to Sebastopol.

In business since 1955 under various mom-and-pop owners, the spinning wheel is a leftover gimmick that allows indecisive customers to use a carnival-type wheel to determine what flavor they're going to have.

I know because I came up bust on at least one flavor.\n\nI decided to go for three flavors with a $4 Double serving in a cup. The Bumpy Freeway was their term for rocky road and just what I wanted with the marshmallows and nuts in milk chocolate ice cream. The Pistachio Almond was also fine, but the Four C's was a train wreck of a flavor. the combination of chocolate, coffee, champagne and cherry brought out a medicinal flavor I couldn't shake for quite some time (photo: http://bit.ly/10MqCb8). Jamie was wiser and stuck with a $2.95 Single in a cup combining Rum Raisin and Cookie Doughboy (photo: http://bit.ly/19jtArl).

Polly Ann's has unique flavors with deliciousness and depth!\n\nTaro is a flavor that often tastes overly sweet and artificial, whether in milk teas or ice cream, but Polly Ann's truly does it justice. Their taro has a prominent and authentic taste to it that's delicious without being too sweet.\n\nMost ice cream shops have some form of green tea ice cream, but none can compare to Polly Ann's jasmine green tea flavor. You'll taste jasmine blossoms as well as green tea in every lightly sweetened spoonful.\n\nIf you've had red bean, you'll love Polly Ann's red bean flavor. If you haven't had red bean, you'll still love it, too! The red bean is prominent without tasting sugary or artificial.\n\nMy favorite flavor by far is the black sesame ice cream I've only ever seen at Polly Ann's.

And before the whole gourmet/artisanal ice cream trend in the Bay Area, there was Polly Ann. \n\nPolly Ann is true SF original and a local staple that has been forgotten. Unlike the more trendy ice cream stores, which only offer a few flavors each day based on the seasonal availability of ingredients, Polly Ann sells ice cream in the traditional way, offering more flavors than you can possibly imagine.\n\nWhat should you get when you're there? Hands down, Polly Ann's most popular flavor is lychee. If I'm not mistaken, they're the first to make ice cream with this fruit. While most fruit-flavored ice cream tastes a little artificial, Polly Ann's lychee ice cream taste like fresh lychee. \n\nAnother one of their distinctive flavors is jasmine. Many ice cream stores now offer jasmine on their menu; Polly Ann has offered this flavor for over 20 years. Their jasmine ice cream is so fragrant, it hits your nose as you draw the scoop to your mouth. \n\nAnd lastly, their pumpkin ice cream is the best and is a must try.\n\nIf you can't decide on which flavor to choose, spin the wheel and let Lady Luck make the decision for you.\n\nAs the Upper Sunset become more trendy as the hipsters begin to move in and more higher end stores open up, I hope residents here will begin to recognize how great Polly Ann's ice cream is and help them revive their former glory as one of the best ice cream stores in the Bay.

Sesame was the creamiest and the sesame taste was comforting. The sweet yam one was comforting too. It's not too savory, it's lightly sweet with a few sweet yam pieces.\n\nEveryone else made their order and we were all satisfied. \n\nWould recommend.", "author": "Sofia R."}

Pretty \"out there\" for being in San Francisco.  Not really much around, so it doesn't make for a convenient dessert place for me.\n\nThere is a huge list of flavors, but none of them particularly stood out to me, and they aren't on display like nearly every other ice cream shop in existence, so you can't use that to help decide.  The ones I tried were pretty boring and straight forward, but at least it had a good consistency to the ice cream.\n\nThe one great aspect of Polly Ann for me was the spin wheel.  Since there are so many uninteresting flavors, it was very difficult to decide, so the spin wheel solved that problem for me.  In addition, there was a chance for free ice cream.\n\nPricing is reasonable, and they have a check-in offer for a free scoop.\n\nThe ice cream was no where close to a match for Bi-Rite or Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous.

If you buy 4 Polly Ann gift-cards for $10, you get a free steamed bun. You can redeem each gift card for a scoop of ice-cream worth about $3 each,  normally. Very good deal. Worth waiting in line for the free scoop too. The total wait starting from the door of Eggettes to Polly Ann only took about 10-15 minutes so the wait was not bad at all.

Perhaps I'm a creature of habit (or taste buds) but those 3 have served my ice cream cravings well.

(You green tea ice cream lovers will know what I'm talking about, the whole green tea ice cream debate.)  Same with the taro.  It's not dyed some crazy grape color,  isn't overly sweet, and isn't artificial: you can feel the itty bitty slivers of taro now and then.\n\nMost recently I've ventured out of my comfort zone and have tried the hazelnut, rum raisin, Thai tea, and Jasmine tea.  Jasmine was very fragrant indeed and something I will likely add to my go-to list.\n\nWanted to try macapuno this last week when I was in, but it was not on the day's line up.

Not my favorite ice cream in the world but the eclectic variety of flavors is undeniable and you'd be silly not to drop in once and at least sample some of their creations. You could always spin their wheel of fortune. When an employee spins it and it lands on free spot, you get an ice cream of your picking gratis but if it lands on a particular flavor, you're stuck with that one or it's neighbors. I'm too much of a wuss to try my hand at it but I've seen people do it every time I've come in. \n\nTheir specialties lie in the realm of Asian flavors like lychee, mango, green tea, taro coconut, thai tea, black sesame, vanilla with condensed milk, jasmine, and even durian, which is a major selling point for me. At the risk of sounding cliche, the green tea is and will always be my favorite. The non-Asian types I've tried are the pistachio, star wars, and the strawberry oreo, all of which would be best described as awesome. In addition to cups and cones, they have sundaes, banana splits, and shakes like any other classic parlor. Somehow, I've lost my childlike tendencies and get one scoop in a cup like a boring mom. \n\nI'd probably give them four stars but one of the kinds I tried was freezer burned and had some ice chips in it. Hell nawww. I guess not all of the flavors have enough turnover, which is not surprising. I can't imagine there are people making daily trips for rum raisin. \n\nFor all you East Bay people... if you don't want to venture to West Sunset, Ranch 99 in Pacific East Mall carries their products but if you want that dripping cone of Star Wars, you have to make the trip.", "author": "Ruby G."}

My reason for being sad was cause my guy chose League of Legends over me.. -sad face- (boys and their toys.. -__-) But it was made up when he treated me out for ice cream, Eggettes (next door), and a ghetto cup noodle dinner! :) \n\nWho eats ice cream on a rainy night? Apparently quite an amount of people do! When my guy and I stepped in, there were a few couples and families sitting around eating ice cream. The service is good, as we were greeted by the two girls behind the counter immediately when we stepped in. Parking can be a pain since it's street. (There were 2 spots right by the entrance but all the single cars decided to be greedy and take up two spots!).  There are probably about 4-5 tables, so if you plan on eating inside, better snag one while you can! \n\nWhat's interesting about this place is, they don't just sell ice cream...but they also sell CANDY! Now I'm not talking about M&M's, Snicker bars, and stuff from Costco...I'm talking about Sour Patch, Nerds Rope (omg, do you ever see these stuff around anymore?), ring pops, etc. Do you remember those old school Kool-Aid bottles with those twisty caps? Omg. They sell those too!! How awesome! I thought they were extinct! It's like I almost relived my childhood all over again.. \n\nWhat flavors of ice cream do they serve?? They have a variety of ice cream flavors, some interesting ones too! To name a few, there's Durian, Lychee, Taro, Jasmine, Red Bean, etc. When you look at the wall, you can be quite overwhelmed..I wouldn't blame you though, cause there's over 40 flavors! If you can't decide, just spin the wheel and let it decide for you! (Too bad it was broken when I came.. -sadface-) \n\nNow back to ordering ice cream! I ordered a mango & strawberry swirl with a scoop of vanilla on the side. I ordered it in a cup and when the girl first set it down on the counter for me while my guy ordered, the first thing I noticed was an eyelash in my mango & strawberry swirl ice cream... Does this mean the people who make the ice cream rub their eyes while making it? Anyways, I'm not the type of person to make a big deal out of things, so I just took it out and moved on with my life. The mango & strawberry swirl wasn't what I expected, maybe because I kinda had high expectations for it..so I wasn't really satisfied. As for the vanilla, you can never go wrong with vanilla! When I mixed in mango & strawberry swirl with vanilla into my mouth, the mango & strawberry swirl sure took away the flavor..I could hardly taste my vanilla! \n\nOverall, I think I will give this place a second chance some time in the future..only cause my guy says it has some good flavors, haha. Hopefully when I do come back, the wheel will work again!

It is sooooooo strong in flavor and not to mention smell that they have to separate it from everything else.  I was expecting a small hint of durian or something, but no.  It was the real deal.  It smelled like it and tasted like it.  Full on flavor.  Go Polly Ann for getting that much of flavor into it, but no thank you.  I couldn't do it.

About two weeks ago, my uncle decided it would be a bright idea to bring all my little cousins and niece here for some ice cream.

I asked the lady behind the counter if they had banana oreo ice cream. She looked at the menu on the wall, walked to the back, walked back out, looked at me, and finally found it. She told me it was the last three gallon they had. I felt so bad for making her go through the trouble that I bought a junior scoop. Though it's a unique flavor, it wasn't my cup of tea. It's just like cookies and cream with banana extract added. I'll pass. \n\nThe other day my cousin and I went to go pick up two cakes and one of them had durian ice cream. The man behind the counter said, \"The durian one is wrapped in the plastic bag...cause you know..,\" implying that it emits a foul odor. HAHA, I cracked up on the spot.

During my final exams though, as a much needed break, I finally found the perfect time to visit.\n\nThe shop located on the corner of Noriega and 39th, and serves up a variety of flavors.  Some of the standout flavors, in my opinion, were: green tea, red bean, jasmine tea, lychee, and sesame.  The sesame is very interesting and all I have to say is, make sure you try a sample before ordering it for the first time- it's very sesame-y.  \n\nI got a scoop of red bean ice cream and it's a lot bean-ier and heartier than other red bean ice creams I've had before.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy boyfriend had a scoop of the lychee and it was really delicious as well.  This ice cream was a bit smoother in consistency than my red bean, but both were great.  Their ice creams are all really flavorful and I love the different flavor options.  They still serve up the classic flavors too, if you want something a little more familiar.\n\nThe pricing is very fair/average and the service was fine.  They sell plenty of pre-packed tubs of ice cream at a very fair price as well.  I'll probably be back soon.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Much less trouble finding parking, and it doesnt get too crowded. Never a long line, usually just 1-2 persons in front of me. \n\nI was leaning towards a 3.5 stars for the ice cream, but what bumped it up to a 4 and not a 3 star was because of the many many different flavors available - and some of them are fairly unique and interesting. A lot of Asian-esque flavors. The flavors of the ice cream do not lie - they tend to be fairly strong and taste strongly of whatever flavor they are.The texture was good too, but not SUPER amazing. Creamy and fairly smooth. \n\nThey don't have any obnoxious signs about limiting the number of samples to have, which I really like. If you're not a douche, you're not gonna take THAT many samples, but sometimes, you just want more than just two! I'm looking at you, Holy Gelato. And with the sheer number of flavors they have available here, it's nice to try multiple flavors  before settling on one. \n\nOf the flavors I tried, I really liked their mango, green tea and jasmine tea. The banana oreo was super good too! I was hesitant about it, but that's what the tasting is for. The two flavors blended really well together actually. \n\nOne more unique cool thing about this place is they have this wheel-of-fortune-esque game where you can spin a wheel. If it lands on the free space, you get a free ice cream! If not, you have the choices of choosing between one of three flavors; whichever flavor the wheel lands on and the ones next to them. I have yet to be gutsy enough to try this - I like the choice of CHOOSING my flavor of ice cream. Because ice cream is serious business, yo.", "author": "Lena Y."}

If you can't decide what flavor ice cream to get (which wouldn't be surprising because they are a plethora of choices on the menu), you can spin the wheel. It's like a really relaxed version of Russian roulette, on the one side, you have to get the flavor you land on, but on the plus side, if you land on \"free\" you can get a free ice-cream cone!\n\nNow here's the funny bit, my pointer landed right in the middle of \"free\" and another flavor. So the server gave me a cone for half-price (although my friends and I would have argued that it was leaning slightly towards the free slot). But then again the store owner can do whatever she wants so...haha\n\nAnyway, anecdote aside, I got the red bean flavor ice-cream, which is something I absolutely love because it's not too sweet but has a really satisfying texture to it. The decor is kinda neat too, there are joke signs everywhere (most of them about ice cream, but some are really amusing to read).", "author": "Samuel H."}

I love this place because they actually make pretty unique flavors (there are close to fifty different unique flavors) that you would never see anywhere else. It is somewhat far away from stuff... but trust me... totally worth making the trip there! (Or if you're lazy, they sell their stuff in Asian grocery stores too... just not as extensive selection).\n\nThe green tea ice cream has a very strong flavor that I like... same with the coffee too. They have a giant wheel you can spin in the center of the store... if you're lucky, you'll get a free ice cream... whatever you want! The only catch is if you don't land on a free square, you have to take whatever flavor (number) the wheel lands on. On the bright side, if you're terrible at making decisions... the wheel is for you! Someday... maybe someday... I'll try every flavor they have.\n\nIce cream here is your typical, slightly more expensive like in any other \"boutique\" ice creamery, but it's definitely worth it. Plus I don't mind supporting my local businesses when they're that freaking good :D The store is super small (basically a counter... maybe a couple chairs and that's it), but it's super fun to read all the random stuff they have posted up on their walls while you get our ice cream. One of my favorites is the \"I only eat ice cream on days that end in Y.\" Look for it by the door.\n\nSide note: Polly Ann gives free ice cream to dogs?! I went there there with my dog once, and they give you this tiny cone with a little bit of ice cream in it for the dog. Even my dog loves Polly Ann.

The jasmine tea was good but you really have to concentrate to convince yourself you're eating taro, as it was mostly sweet with some taro bits.

The flavor wheel is creative though, I'll give them that.\n\nMy friend who always gets green tea from here ordered the lemon cheesecake this time.

What more needs to be said about this place?  I'll just add some random notes about this ol' stomping ground of mine when I lived in the city...\n\nI estimated I burned about 150 calories running at a brisk pace from my old house in the outer Sunset to the beach and back (roughly a little over a mile).  Then, I promptly added those calories back after stopping by this place to get a scoop of some good homemade ice cream.  If I felt like two scoops, then I'd run that extra mile along the beach.\n\nI recall they gave free ice cream to dogs if you bring them in.  Cute thought but bad idea.  Just what you want, a dog with the runs afterward.  I remember many of the female dog owners that would come in here were really cute.  Not that this was why I came here.  (There were other good-looking women that would come here too...minus the dog.)  \n\nSpeaking of the runs, this place is good for the lactose intolerant and very Asian friendly (yes, often they go hand-in-hand), with flavors like durian, taro, ube, lychee and logan.  My personal favorite was mango, although I still preferred the sorbet at Double Rainbow a little more.  \n\nA large variety of flavors you won't find anywhere else.

There's also a possibility of landing on a Free ice cream slot, which kinda rocks.\n\nI knew what I wanted for once, so I didn't brave the wheel. I've already tried a few of their flavors at grocery stores, so I settled on Jasmine Tea Ice Cream, which sadly, can't be bought at grocery markets. \n\nService was friendly, and my ice cream was soooo good.

The store was empty and my girlfriend and I were deciding on what flavor we wanted. \n\nWe asked to try a couple different flavors and when we requested only our SECOND flavor, the lady behind the counter (I'm assuming the owner, she was older and chinese) made a remark to us along the lines of \"This is your last taste OK!\" as if we juvenile delinquents who only came in to try free samples!\n\nI'm sorry but this is a society based on consumers and if you are going to try and restrict a patron of your store from deciding out what product of yours he would like to purchase, then you have quite an askew view of how to run a business.\n\nWith that being said, my girlfriend and I were quite offended that she has snapped at us like this and promptly informed her she had just lost two customers and that we would be taking our business elsewhere.

Perhaps my palate is not as refined as yours but what I tried was not anything better than what I could purchase at the supermarket.  To their credit they definitely have more variety than a supermarket but what's the point when the taste is average at best.\n\nNow, the main reason I will never go to Polly Ann Ice Cream is because of their rude service.  My girlfriend asked to have their wheel spun because she couldn't decide on what flavor to select.  Their response was something like \"you have to buy what the wheel lands on\" and then they spun the wheel.  WAIT A SECOND - what did they mean we have to buy what the wheel lands on?  Is someone going to strip me of my money?  I don't think so.  If the wheel lands on something I don't want to purchase you better believe I am not going to buy it.  If this business (using the term as loose as possible) wants to do things that way then have a price for spinning the wheel and have customers pay before the wheel is spun...  \n\nThen...my friend tried to pay with her credit card and mysteriously the credit card wouldn't work in their store.  Mind you this is the same credit card that worked earlier that day and later that day.  Again - in a rude manner we were informed the credit card wasn't working and we needed to pay in cash.\n\nIf you want to spend far more than you should on ice cream, then at least go somewhere else.

In each place I have come across in my travels, there has always been one location where an ice cream man set up shop and either through sheer nostalgic reasons or perhaps they're a little like Willy Wonka and try really strange flavors, they all seem to forever be known as \"the place\" to go for ice cream. \n\nThis is the location for S.F. to get your ice cream fix. Mainly due to the off the beaten track flavors that you'll possibly imagine they have. Stuff from Rose ice cream to my favorite.. Durian. \n\nYes, I said it. Durian ice cream. The one food that some pansy on the travel channel will not eat, they make into a really tasty ice cream. So you can skip the middle man of having to smell this foul smelling fruit while cutting it up and just consume it whole. \n\nThis stuff typically smells like a dead body does after a couple of days of marinating in the sun, if you catch my drift. But when you taste it.. Oh man, it's some really good stuff. Sort of taste like avocado with a better kick to it. \n\nThis place was the first place I ever had black sesame ice cream and I've seen it pop up here and there from time to time and I have to say, it's always been a nice treat to see and enjoy. \n\nSpeaking of which, I did see Avocado on the menu once here. I can imagine that it's really good. Having tried some of the other flavors, they may not all be for everyone, but the folks here are really good about giving you samples, so by all means take advantage of that before you go for a cup of whatever you're getting. \n\nNow the service of this place is pretty top notch. And while it is Cash only, I don't think that should be a deterrent.

The consistency is rich and creamy with a strong flavor of green tea that doesn't make it too bitter which is what I like.

The wheel has all their ice cream flavors on it and once you commit to spinning it, you must get the flavor that it lands on or the two flavors next to the one you land on.

Polly Ann has many flavors, I don't know how many. 30-40? I don't know, but it would take me a long time to work my around to all of them.\n\nThe prices are rather expensive for regular ice cream; I'm presuming it's because it's San Francisco and the rare flavors, but who knows why? Despite that, because the ice cream is so good, people always come back.\n\nThe service was good, the people behind the counter are super-nice. Be sure to try some new flavors you've never tried and be more adventurous. There were some annoying people with us in the store who only got the really lame flavors and didn't want to try any of the more exotic ice cream flavors that are really unique to Polly Ann. \n\nThe ice cream was really good -- the texture of the ice cream (different from gelato, which is much thicker and denser) is very light and airy. The ice cream was not too sweet but very packed with flavor. The lychee ice cream even had pieces of lychee in it; it was so delicious. \n\nGenerally, I prefer gelato over ice cream, but this is excellent ice cream. You can also buy ice cream in (half-gallon or pint or something? not sure on the size of the little tub of ice cream) a to-go container to take home, which is nice. When you have people over and just put out ice cream, they might not be so impressed, but they will be when you take out some crazy delicious honeydew melon or lychee ice cream. Yum!\n \nOne criticism: I had the lychee ice cream in my freezer for a while, and a few weeks later, the ice cream separated and tasted terrible. We had to throw it out, it was completely inedible. I'm not sure if that was because we left the ice cream out too long one day or if that's just how old ice cream gets? Just make sure to eat the ice cream quickly after you buy it to be safe. \n\nWe're coming back, though, and we're still buying the ice cream to go but eating it a lot more quickly this time.

The employees were kind, helpful, and patient (very important for an indecisive girl looking at a menu of 46 amazing flavors).

The honey dew flavor reminds me of the honey dew boba...which means it's DELICIOUS!!  It wasn't too sweet--had the right amount of honey dew in it.  It definitely satisfied my boba craving. haha  The strawberry oreo was also very delicious... think cookies and cream but with strawberry!  The strawberry had good flavor and creaminess to it.  In fact, both of them did.  \n\nOnly thing I didn't like about Polly Ann's was the service... I only tried 3 flavors, and the server was already getting annoyed.  What the heck!  She actually asked to serve someone else because I took longer than 30 seconds to decide what I wanted after my 3 samples.  LAME. She didn't even offer to spin the wheel.

They have made everything more sanitary, which is a great thing, but I missed the individual bulk candies everything used to come in. Now everything is wrapped up and much more expensive than Safeway or another old liquor store. Some of the workers seem miserable and not too great. I mean don't get me wrong, I occasionally run into some of the veteran workers who clearly remember and greet me. I LOVE EM. But some of the newer people are a little.. misfitted? I feel weird and scared walking in.\n\nPrices have slightly raised and portions have also slightly declined. They accept card now, which is a definite plus. Wish they would open later though..\n\nI guess at the end of the day, my conclusion is.. I miss the old polly anns.", "author": "Wendy X."}

Sesame and lychee are among my favorites, and while I tried the durian root on a dare, really did not find it all that horrible. They also make a mean ice cream sunday with all the fixings, and carry soft serve ice cream, frozen bananas, and a vast array of candy. They even sell their ice cream by the pint, if you're not as lucky as I am to live within walking distance.\n\nHowever, as Polly Ann's is geared more towards the to-go customer, do not expect elaborate porcelain dishes or plentiful seating. The seating is in fact extremely limited. This weekend I had to break up a fight between my boyfriend's 2 year old and some other sugar crazed child over the one precious remaining stool. He had that same glare in his eyes that I get when some poor unknowing soul comes in between me and a cab. Also, apparently in another effort to encourage customers to indulge at home, they keep all their napkins behind the counter! So be sure to ask for a big handful if you plan to eat in house and keep your mess in check.\n\nAlso, for the rest of you dog lovers out there, Polly Ann's is very dog friendly.

After realizing how far it was... my sister decided that she is going to stock up because she doesn't want to drive this far again.  lol I was the first in the store and I saw the abundant choices to choose from... so what else can I do but ask for samples! ^_^ \n\nThey ran out of Durian, but I found it in the freezer so I bought a huge tub blindly to try.

I said back in Mandarin... \"where's the hot guy?\"  They were taken aback and were surprised... I guess I could have remained incognito and listened to their conversations without them knowing but I rather shock ppl that HELLO I am Asian.

This is a very Asian flavored store so a lot of their fruit flavors have that flowery oomph in the taste.  I ended up tasting a ton of flavors but decided on the 5 mentioned above.  The durian ice cream ended up being not what I thought it to be.  I don't think it's strong enough in flavor and in taste, but it definitely has the funk! Warning... Durian is really for those who have had it, don't try it hear unless you know what it is.\n\nI thought the mango had a nice flavor with the flowery touch and the lychee was only so-so.  The best is still the black sesame and it's just as good as when we had it at Sanmi.  I think that will be the first tub to run out!

It is good, but I'm going to talk about the wheel instead.\n\nWhen you go to Polly Ann's, you should ask for the wheel.  When you do, the worker will turn around nonchalantly and spin the wheel.  While it's spinning, he or she will not seem very interested in where it lands.  That's part of their job; I've spun the wheel dozens of times, and never has an employee been interested.\n\nIn the old days, the wheel had nails in between each section so that it was clear which number you had landed on.  The nails are gone, so it's often a judgment call.  That's unfortunate, because if you're a purist, and you should be, you would insist on getting the flavor it landed on.  Even if you don't like it.  I had the distinct misfortune of the wheel landing on durian once, so I had to deal with gas-breath for two days.  But I don't regret it.  I've also won free ice cream twice with the wheel, so that one unfortunate experience was worth it.  Oh, and they've removed durian from the wheel rotation, so you don't have to worry about spinning anymore.\n\nThe weird sayings aren't as fitting in the new interior, but they're pretty cool in a corny way.", "author": "John S."}

I especially notice the Wheel Of Fortune wheel in the center.  If you can't decide, you are welcome to spin the wheel.  Each slot on the wheel has a number that represents a flavor on the menu.

You can ask the person behind the counter to spin it, and if it lands on a number, you can choose that corresponding flavor, or the two that are next to it on the wheel. If you are lucky enough for it to land on free, then I guess you get free ice cream. I don't know if you have to get the flavor that it lands on, but I don't think they enforce it that strictly. Do you really think they can FORCE you to order durian ice cream against your will? hahaha\n\nThey have a pretty good amount of flavors you can't find anywhere else. Jasmine Tea, Durian are the two that really vividly pop up in my mind, but they are always changing it up. \n\nThe texture of the ice cream is very creamy and very soft. Personally I prefer Lappert's over in Sausillito more, as far as their coconut/pineapple flavor is concerned. \n\nbut what i DOOOOOOO really really REALLY like is that they will dip your ice cream in chocolate to create that nice hard shell. i LOVE that. one extra star for just that. other wise i would have given them maybe 3 stars. \n\nThe sundae's are kinda blah. It's a tiny plastic bowl container with two scoops of ice cream (of your choice) and two toppings of your choice, the bf chose drizzled chocolate fudge and strawberry jam stuff.

When I was in my first trimester, I got a random hankering for ice cream. Not just any ice cream, mind you, but ice cream from that \"mystery-place-out-in-the-outer-sunset that-I-can-never-remember-the-name -of and-have-no-idea-how-to-find even-though-I've-been-there-3-times\" spot. \n\nSo, Mr. B and I cruised around the outer sunset doing large loops of various blocks of on-and-on identical type housing with nary a glimpse of the place. We were on both sides of Sunset Boulevard, and then all the way to the ocean and back. It was getting late. He thought I'd officially lost it in being pregnant and was merely humoring me by letting me keep looking for it... After 20 minutes, it became a QUEST and, in my mind, this mystery ice cream place was THE VALHALLA of ice creameries. Screw Mitchells and its long lines. I was gonna get me come mystery ice cream. \n\nAfter 40 minutes, we finally stumbled upon Polly Ann and made our way in, exhausted in our search, like ship wreck survivors being tossed ashore. Nah. Just kidding. We walked in and ordered some ice cream, and it was DELISH. Now, it's no Herrell's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/k6ykGROMhNbpLQqcwkVzVw?hrid=Wry9_rCVaMOLD4wy6R63Vg),  but you'd kind of have to make your ice cream with pure fat to match Herrell's creaminess. \n\nThe ice cream was great, as was the service - young clean cut kids, very friendly and polite. They will also hook you up with ice cream for your dog, if you happen to wander by with your pup. It's a great destination spot for late night ice cream if you're on the NW side of the city instead of the SE (in which case, it's obvious you should go to Mitchell's http://www.yelp.com/biz/76smcUUGRvq3k1MVPUXbnA). \n\nOn a last minute impulse, I decided to try a taste of the durian ice cream (after polishing off my scoop of mint chip, or whatever comparatively mundane - and therefore sane - flavor I'd tried). They let you sample flavors here. The fellows behind the counter were really nice about it - the stuff STINKS to high heaven, so much so that, even though it's obviously frozen, they have to keep it especially wrapped and in a separate Tupperware container so as not to stink up the store. So, it was nice of them to go through the process of exposing themselves to the stench just to give little ole me a flavah savah of it. \n\nI'm a SERIOUS garlic lover and I love onions too... Yet, since I'd gotten pregnant, I just couldn't handle the mere thought of eating either. The counter-guys explained to me that durian tasted kind of like garlic and onion together... and I STILL insisted on tasting it. Let's just say that they were right, only it's like rotten garlic and onions, with some stale milk tossed in for extra blechiness. The taste lived in my mouth for, seriously, 4 days. \n\nEven though it was the nastiest thing I've ever eaten in my life, I LOVE that Polly Ann offers it and, now, not pregnant, I'm curious to try it just one more time (glutton for punishment), just to see if it tastes different without all the hormones in my body rejecting it. \n\nSo, if you have a hankering for getting ice cream for your dog, this is the place to go. If you want some late-night ice cream, this is the spot.  If you love durian, you'd better camp outside and get it while you can (I think it's only a seasonal flavor that they carry).

Whatever flavor it lands on, you will have a choice of that flavor or one to the left or to the right of it. \n\nI've never had a bad ice cream experience at this place.

These guys serving ice cream need to take a class on \"customer service\" alone, period.

Everyday is probably a bad day for him. Poor guy! I won't be going back after today's visit. I told the guy clearly that I wanted a scoop of \"T-A-R-O\" and he gives me \"C-A-R-A-M-E-L.\" He knows he made a mistake, but insisted that he did ask me twice when \"C-L-E-A-R-L-Y\" he did not! Quit trying to cover up your mistake, fool!!!! Someone asking for taro is waaaay off from asking for caramel. Say whaaaat???? I'm sure this isn't the first time this has happened.

I'd been there a couple of times before but had never dared to cross that street to the Place of No Return and Ice Cream. But today I was finally going to do it! I had the perfect excuse: \"drama practice.\" My mother wouldn't be picking me up for an hour. That gave me ample time to walk the two blocks, purchase some delicious ice cream with money obtained from my mother (ha! foolish woman, providing the very means by which I would flout her authoritah!), return to school, sit and eat, revel in the sense of danger I felt, and then sneak back inside the building so I could say I had been there all along.\n\nI stepped off the sidewalk, and thus began my rebellion.\n\nI crossed the two streets (while looking both ways; I was rebelling, but I would never betray my beloved safety procedures), entered the store, climbed the little steps next to the door so I could see over the counter, prepared to order the forbidden coffee ice cream... and my mother walked in to pick up a treat for my brother and me.\n\nMy plan may not have worked, but she was so proud of my honesty (\"I was chasing a ball across the street because my drama teacher threw it out the window and then I saw your hair so I came over to see you and the ball rolled down the hill so you won't be able to find it but that's what happened and can I have some ice cream?\") that she let me get coffee ice cream. D'aww.\n\nSo yeah, I have fond memories of the place. When I was really little my dad would walk me up the street from our house, buy us both ice cream (I'd always get chocolate chip, he'd get turkish coffee and pretend not to notice when I stole a bite), and then carry me home once the post-ice cream bliss set in.\n\nMinus a star for the new location. I miss the dingy hole-in-the-wall. It may have been cramped and dirty, but you know what? It was home! Sort of.

If you don't know what flavor you want, you can spin the wheel and it will pick a flavor for you.  \nI went here with my gf and one of my friends and between the three of us we tried about 5 flavors....and let me say....they were all really good :-D \n\nBy far the part of place that sent it over the top for me, was their wide selection of flavors.  More specifically, they have all the traditional american classics like vanilla, chocolate, and peanut butter cup, but they also have unique choices like taro, lychee, and even a ginger one that i am clearly not brave enough to try lol  Oh and best part about that, is that you can literally go into this place and ask to try several of their flavors before you purchase one.  I know between the three of my us who went, we definitely tried a handful of their flavors.  So don't be afraid to ask for a sample when you can't make up your mind! :-)\n\nIf your filipino, their macapuno ice cream i thought was pretty good.  I personally like the kinds of macapuno that has chunks of its different ingredients...this place doesn't have those fun chunks, but the flavor was very much right on.\n\nI did deduct about half a star because of their lack of seating.  We came here during that time a month or so ago when the rain wasn't letting up because of a huge craving for ice cream, and it was definitely hard to eat ice cream standing up, while huddled inside their establishment lol.  \n\nAnyway the point is, no matter what your in the mood for, this is the ice cream shop for you!

I love going by there even though it's moved a few spaces down from it's original spot because it brings back memories from my childhood.\n\nI would walk my dog to Polly Ann's and he would get an ice cream just like mine.\n\n I think it's good that this place is still around because of what it means to the area. I would put this place in the same category as Doggie Diner as places that help create childhood memories. So much has changed in the Sunset but, some places like Polly Ann's age gracefully and become a place you would want to bring your child after their soccer game and experience the same things you did as a child.\n\nIf you go and feel adventurous spin the wheel.

There was only a narrow space in front of the counter, and stuff tacked all over the wood paneled wall behind you. I remember the wheel having some heft.\n\nI was so stoked when I eventually moved to a house around the corner from Polly Ann...only to find it closed and the building set to be demolished! A year or so went by, and then it reopened! And the place was laid out better, is probably cleaner, but for some reason lacks character. The wheel looks like it's made out of pressboard. \n\nStill, the same hand-painted flavor signs, and the same funky flavors. I think the ice cream is good. I've spun the wheel a couple of times and I tried Strawberry Rocky Road one time, which was actually very tasty. I wish they had it more often. If I get ice cream, I get it here. I hate to confess it, though - on the off chance I get to go out to Mitchell's, I find the flavors there more varied and tempting.\n\nIt's still a hit with the kids after school, though, and maybe time will \"season\" the place so it regains some warmth.

I was expecting a bit more from a small ice cream shop, a bit more of a homemade taste. There are no chunks of things in the ice cream. My butterscotch swirl had no visible butterscotch. Most of the flavorings are chemical. The black raspberry tasted cold, and that was about it.

Taste is not a problem.\n\nPrices are par with other shops.   \n\nThe thing that makes this place special is it's position in the area.  Polly Ann has been a staple in the outter sunset as long as I can remember.  Memories of coming there after school and meeting my friends there for candy brings happiness to my old heart.

You claim to be apart of the city, but it takes me longer to get from anywhere in the sunset to Down Town San Francisco, than it does from my house in Daly City. The only reason I visit is because I have friends and family living in your endless rows of city suburbia. \n\nWhen I agree to hang out with my cousin we usually do three things. Play rock band until his wife is tired of us singing to songs we think we know, but we don't. Go down to Golden Buddha so we can get horrible service, but filling food (I had the gourmet \"chicken\" and rice last night, quite tasty). Cut through the park and get some P.A.I.C. \n\nPolly Ann Ice Cream has more ice cream that you can shake a stick at,(... but why would you shake a stick at anything in large amounts?.. I don't get that... and I still don't get the phrases \"peach keen\" \"the bees knees\" \"same difference\"... ok I get \"same difference,\" but I just don't like the sound of it... ) From classic flavors like Rocky Road, to not so classic flavors as 5 korean characters that I can only guess translates to \"ginger,\" or \"death to round eye.\"\n\nBy now you must know that Polly Ann has a giant wheel of destiny, that turn turn turns, and it will give you an ice cream flavor you may or may not ever again yearn. The first and last time I spun the magic wheel I got the fun flavor of \"4 c's,\" which turned out to be c1 = chocolate, c2= coffee, c3= cherry, and c4= champagne. I like all the things separately. I like some of them in pairs, but all four, It ended up tasting like MEAT ice cream. I did eat it though, and I ended up liking it, but I don't think I could willingly order it.\n\nI guess what P.A's is a little famously kind of known for is their durian ice cream. It is a tropical asian fruit that smells and tastes like gasoline... or like when you are trying to light your gas stove... it taste how that gas smells. I've tasted it... and yeah it wasn't great. My cousins friend actually ordered it once, and threw up, silly white guy, but I have been told that it is a very popular flavor, and I believe them. \n\nIt gets three stars because you are no bi-rite creamery, but you should really get 3-1/2 because you have weird drinks with names like \"green monster\" and you also have fro-yo and candy. \n\nGood job, high five!", "author": "danny e."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-01", "description": "Polly Ann is a truly unique ice cream parlor in that they have an eclectic mix of flavors, which include such standard fare as mint chip and chocolate chip cookie dough as well as more exotic Asian varieties such as red bean paste and lychee. Moreover, the place is unique as a result of its having a wheel of fortune style spinny wheel with all of their flavors on it (with the exception of the infamous durian) that you can have the person behind the counter spin if you are either feeling adventurous or simply can't decide what to get. \n\nHowever, despite the ice cream being very good and the service very kind, my friends and I have developed a rite of passage which involves trying the aforementioned durian flavor. Now what is the big deal about durian you may ask. Well, in the words of Anthony Bourdain, the famous chef and traveler extraordinaire, durian's flavor can be characterized thusly: \"Its taste can only be described as...indescribable, something you will either love or despise. ...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother.\" In my personal experience, however, at least in terms of the durian ice cream at Polly Ann, it tastes more like gasoline than anything else. Furthermore, it seems to make you burp afterward, which means that no matter what you eat to cover up the taste (my friend ate so many Altoids that he literally teared up) you are constantly in danger of being reminded of the unholy thing you just ate should you decide to burp. \n\nThus, if you are looking for great ice cream in a cool off-beat sort of place then Polly Ann is right for you. However, if you're looking for a place to trick a friend (or enemy for that matter) into eating one of the most repugnant things imaginable then Polly Ann is even more right for you.", "author": "Nick C."}

She spun first, and of course, landed on some strange ice cream flavor (I don't remember which, but it ended up tasting pretty good).  I tried to order without spinning the wheel, but she caught me.

All thanks to the selection of both classic and exotic flavors like durian, honey dew, Turkish coffee and star wars (it's a name for one of the flavors). There's literally a wall dedicated to all the ice cream flavors, but half of that wall is occupied by a wheel. This is one of the best parts of this Polly Ann, which is often fun and helpful. If you can't decide on what to get, spin the wheel and let it choose for you. Don't worry if the flavor that the wheel chose for you is unappealing because that flavor's neighbors are part of your options too. That's the helpful aspect of the wheel and the fun part is the uncertainty of what flavor you'll end up with! If you want more than just ice cream, there are malts, milkshakes, sundaes, soft serve and banana splits. Want to take some home? There's plenty of tubs for you to choose from! \n\nThe service at Polly Ann's is always casual and friendly with a professional attitude.

Initially, I felt that all of the old charm, from the original store was lost, but I really think that the new store kept most of it's charm.  The choice of flavors are incredible!  They have so many to choose from that it is not possible for them to offer all of them at once, so they rotate the flavors and as aa ice cream lover, you can go there often to try out new flavors as they are offered.\n     I definately reccomend this place if you are an ice cream lover..  endless flavors..  yummy!", "author": "Lester S."}

As years passed, I moved to their lychee and sesame ice cream.  Polly Ann's homemade ice cream tastes natural and delicious.  They also have some interesting ice cream flavors you will not find anywhere.  Oh yeah, and if you visit during the afternoon, you'll see a cascade of middle school children lining up for ice cream!

The macapuno was delicious, however --- creamy, with chunks of tender coconut. \n\nTake your cone outside and lean against the stop sign at 39th and Noriega. You'll get a nice dose of fresh sea air and a great view of the Pacific. \n\nTwo other great things about Polly Ann's: no lines like you will find at Mitchell's, and, for the truly gluttonous, its close proximity to Eggettes. This is another unique and yummy dessert spot, and a Yelp review for another day.", "author": "Deb K."}

It's closed Mondays, even Memorial Day Mondays.  So now my daughter's lower lip is trembling, and I'm not sure an eskimo pie from the 7-11 cooler is going to save me.  So I Yelp, and my Yelp is Answered!  10 minutes later we're at Polly Ann.  Decor is circa 1987 Kentucky Fried Chicken, but the ice cream is good - at least, the chocolate and the espresso are.  You'll have to try the Gummi Bear for yourself, that's nasty.  Coolest feature is the Decision Wheel - they spin, you take what they give you.  And if it lands on \"free\" then you still have to make a decision, but it don't cost nothin'.  Worth the trip, and your daughter won't cry.  Not too shabby.", "author": "John H."}

I was too chicken to spin the flavor wheel and get something they tasted funky.  Like rose flavor.  Blech.  Personally, roses are pretty and all, and are cool for potpourri, but when it comes to ice cream, I just don't like it.  (That goes for rose flavored macaroons too).   Eventually at Polly Ann's I settled for green tea, which is kind of boring and I could have easily bought at whole tub at Sunset Super.  After all those tastings, I'm still plain and predictable.  But still, the ice cream was so refreshing and I actually went here on a freezing cold day.
