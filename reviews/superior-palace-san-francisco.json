Sadly, since she moved away several years ago, we seldom get a chance to visit.\nHowever, when the SO and I walked in we were greeted with recognition and smiles. The server (Waylan) even remembered what we used to order! (Whaaaat?) I had the usual (unusual) Vegetable Egg Foo Yung made with egg whites only and the SO ordered Pepper Steak. We split a bowl of BBQ pork won ton soup and steamed white rice. Kenny (the boss) produced a plate of Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant for us to try (on the house) and we asked for an order of Chinese Chicken Salad to take home.  \nThe Egg Foo Yung made with egg whites was fantastic as always. Most restaurants won't attempt it, it's too hard to make. The SO ate the Pepper Steak with his eyes closed he was so happy. He said it was tender, flavorful and better than any place else. The Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant was amazing! Kenny said it was new and had a Thai style sauce; a little hot, a little sweet. Absolutely delicious. We had been jonesing for the Superior Won Ton soup; the broth is delicate, yet flavorful, the won tons are a decent size (made with lots of shrimp) and we love the baby bok choy and slices of charsiu.\nChinese Chicken Salad to go? After a lunch like that you want something light for dinner. Crunchy, tangy and full of tender pieces of chicken, yummy!\nFor a clean, affordable, SF neighborhood  restaurant serving delicious Chinese food this is the place to come.\nThanks to Kenny, Waylan and the rest of the Superior Palace staff for the spectacular meal and the warm welcome. We'll be back!", "author": "Toki N."}

Its a typical night eating with my girlfriend and other friend everything is going well, were having a good time eating food drinking a beer. Then the bill comes. Everything was correct and generally i am a generous tipper, The bill comes out to $98 and some change. I Throw down $120 and sit there packing up the leftovers and finishing my bill, 5 mins of still waiting for my change i grow tiresome and asked the restaurant owner hey can i get my change back? she looks at me confused and im like we clearly paid overly to expect some change back. Waiter pulls me to the side hey its ok i will get you your change. Owner still looks confused, Like what in her right mind does she automatcially think im tipping $22 out of a $98 bill?? crazy much will not be returning to this establishment and i warn you also so you do not get ripped off by these people.

This is probably the worst Chinese food I ever had after living in SF for 30 years. Spending over $65 for a dinner for two for nasty tasting everything is just unfair. The wonton soup literally had 4 dumplings and 2 leaves of bok choy. Sweet and sour pork was just thin slices of pig fat covered in heavy breading. Egg rolls were dark brown and looked like they have suffered a bad case of bubonic plague. Not so fresh, dry tasting fried rice and slimy beef broccoli.

My family and I patron there regularly, so tonight we went for father's day dinner early at 5p when the restaurant wasn't crowded.  We ordered a bunch of entrees and they food came fairly quickly.  Midway through we still didn't get our soup, waiters were busy. Our noodles tasted old.  the old lady, owner came and snatched the platter and mouthed off it was fresh and walked off.  She came back and asked us to order another noodle entree.  We placed the order.  the new replacement noodles came and we were confused because we didn't ask for a replacement so the owner said it was complimentary.  we never got the pan fried noodle platter she insisted we order. That never came.  our check came and all in Chinese and the bad noodles were crossed off. the owner charged us as we had 8 entrees and charged for 9 items.  I flagged her down. She denied comping us, yet the item on the bill was crossed off but not the price.  She paused then snatched the bill and mouthed off again that we didn't have to eat it. I was shocked.  She adjusted the bill and slammed it down.  As I was leaving, i thanked her and she mouthed off again and wouldn't let up.  I had it. I told her it was not right giving us bad food and then promised it free, then charged us and we had horrible service way before the crowd came, so she had the nerve to be rude and I stated my parents patron there weekly.

However, as un-kept and old as it looks from the outside, the food is pretty legit. I've come here on multiple occasions now that I think this place finally deserves some Fifi love. \n\nIt's a great family restaurant and it's nice to see get together dinners held. Whether you're in for a simple weekly dinner or a family reunion, the food ain't bad. For a typical dish, they cook it well. Served to your table hot from the fresh and with enough \"wok heat\" as we like to say it. The portions are great for family style with enough to doggy bag. They also have seafood, too! Crab, lobster, shrimp, fish, etc etc. The best part is that the price ain't hyped up either. It's at a reasonable price that probably costs you about the same as if you were to buy and cook at home yourself. \n\nSide story: For my dad's early birthday dinner, we ordered a 5.5lb Alaskan King Crab at the price of $25/lb. Now, $25/lb might make you go O_____O, but really, it's a lot less than other places. All I can say was that dish was finger licking tasty. Literally. \n\nI will usually avoid Chinese restaurants, but there's something about this place that I feel okay coming. Perhaps the food seems true to its Chinese roots.

The portions are pretty large, so coming in a big group is the only way to try a lot on the menu. Pretty much the whole menu is under $10 (excluding the seafood specialties), and the portions are huge. I saw the table next to us ordered some kind of saucy entree over rice, and I could swear that could feed a person for a good 5 meals. \n\n-----FOOD-----\nWe started with a complimentary shredded lettuce and peanut chicken salad that I believe is served upon request. They gave us a generous portion enough for all of us, with a lightly sweet and savory dressing. Really refreshing and well executed for a simple salad.\n\nWe ordered mostly based off the server's recommendations, which included their renowned seafood specialties: \u77f3\u4e5d\u516c fish two ways (live fish made into a soup and a stir fry) and boiled \u73ca\u745a\u867e (the texture of this shrimp meat is better than lobster). We also had \u6e05\u84b8\u725b\u680f\u6c64 (super tender beef in a light soup reminiscent of pho broth), \u91d1\u6c99\u5357\u74dc (fried salted egg yolk battered pumpkin), honey chicken wings (these are AMAZING) mixed mushroom stir fry, stir fried pea sprouts, and probably more that I can't remember. Everything was really good, but I'd say the beef and the wings are must orders. Best wings EVER and I can't believe I'm recommending wings at a Chinese restaurant. Trust me, the skin is so crispy and sweet and the inside so juicy and perfectly tender. \n\n-----INTERIOR-----\nThe place got quite busy at lunch time and the dining space is cramped in the side room. Three tables for large parties and the chairs are arranged so that you're pretty much back to back with the person at the next table. \n\n-----SERVICE-----\nI usually expect subpar service at Chinese restaurants, so I was pleasantly surprised by our courteous waiters. Our server came by to help switch our dirty plates halfway through the meal, and helped us clear our finished dishes each time a new dish was brought.", "author": "Lily T."}

OK texture.\n\nThough the restaurant is old and dingy on the inside, all of the tables were occupied by large parties (8+). \n\nAt least they didn't try to hustle us like Hong Kong Lounge.", "author": "Jay C."}

We shared the Pot Stickers which were tasty and came with some red vinaigrette, the combination fried rice which was a huge portion and really delicious. I ordered Kung Pao beef and it was also really good. It had one of those red chili peppers and holy crap was it potent.. lots of veggies and beef. The misses had a clay pot with chicken , eggplant and salted fish and she was in heaven. If youre in the neighborhood and trying to decide where to go, there are a few places to try.. try this one first ! \n\nPS - the service was fine,  in case youre wondering.. he took the order did his job and kept refilling my cup with water because of that damn red pepper that just felt like something blew up in my mouth ..\n\nPSS - the prices I felt were reasonable. the problem is it takes a lot of Chinese food to fill me up so we order a lot !", "author": "David S."}

The people that eat here have been coming for years, very family friendly. It's really an understated restaurant and really worth a try. \n\nThey have a varied menu, but it's a must to get fresh seafood. All the specials are written in chinese, but most likely you'll see it on a neighboring table; so just point and ask. The free salad that they offer is pretty generic but I love the dressing. Always ask what fresh seafood they have, I really recommend the geoduck and fresh live shrimp if they have it. The portions are large but can be easily saved for the next days lunch. \n\nThe service is also good, although you can tell they are much more comfortable speaking in chinese. Food comes out fast and hot, and they'll come around to replace dirty plates so you can resume eating. \n\nI do have to say, the bathroom is less than satisfactory; so just hold it. \n\nIn conclusion, a great place to get authentic Chinese food in the city.", "author": "Ingrid H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-09", "description": "I rolled in here with about thirty people deep and enjoyed a delicious banquet style Cantonese dinner celebrating a family member's birthday in the private room to the left.  This place is pretty good for their friendly, attentive service and their non-greasy Chinese food- two things which typically lack in many Chinese restaurants in addition to nice decor which measured up to okay but better than most.\n\nI will go on about the great service first.  Our empty plates were bussed almost immediately.  If our plates were full of discards, the waiters exchanged them with clean plates.  The tea pots stayed full.  The servers walked around with warm smiles and catered to our requests solicitously.\n\nOur dinner consisted of several dishes which were tasty, far from greasy and mostly devoured down to a clean plate.  (fried crab, honey walnut prawns, shrimp, pork fried rice, crab soup, squab, chicken...etc)  The red bean soup that came at the end, however, was an epic fail.  It was't red and possessed more of a light brown color to it.  Yes, it tasted awful.  Rarely anyone digs sweet red bean soup at these places anyways.  \n\nThe decor in this place was acceptable.  There was an idle attempt in the main dining room with uniform artwork in black frames lining the far wall but for the most part, there is no sense of true aesthetics taken into consideration.  The private room we were in had a tiny red and gold sign written in Chinese slightly larger than a bumper sticker at the top of the otherwise white wall (odd placement), and everyone sat under a cheap acoustical tiled ceiling with what appeared to be random placement of recessed lighting.  The cheesy white place mats over the white table cloths made me wonder.  It's not as if they prevent any sort of mess on the white table cloths- just more mess and more waste.  Nevertheless, the lighting in this place is a bit dimmer than the annoying bright fluorescent lights that seem to plague most of these Richmond/Sunset Chinese restaurants.\n\nIf they gave this place more ambiance, I might give it a four star, but my school cafeteria offers better aesthetics.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

I call to order take out and am told my food will be ready in 15 minutes. That is almost not even enough time to get into my car and pick it up. But you have to love that they will have your food ready ASAP.\n\nSecond is the focus on seafood. If you are looking for Chinese food with an emphasis on seafood then look no further. \n\nFinally the price is exceptional. By exceptional I mean that every dish you order will be a dollar or two cheap than the equivalent else where but you are not getting less food.\n\nThe only reason they lose a star is because of the lack of delivery service.

Apparently there are a few restaurants along Balboa Ave. closed on Tuesdays.   According to my trusty Yelp App, this place would be a good back-up plan.\n\nTHE BAD NEWS\nBright fluorescent lights, semi-sticky lazy susan, disheveled front counter with magazines strewn around it, and only one other group of Asians quickly eating their meal in the background gave us pause to think that we might have chosen unwisely.  However, we were too tired, hungry, and annoyed at the light rain outside to remove ourselves. \n\nTHE GOOD NEWS\nI'm glad we stayed.  The folks were nice and accommodated a few necessities of ours. But most importantly, the food was good - enough so, that I'll keep them in mind next time I'm in the area.  What I liked most about this place was the simplicity of the food - seasoned just right and NO worn-down fishy taste that often accompanies places that specialize in seafood.\n\nWHAT WE ORDERED\nFried Flounder - Perfectly fried, tender flesh, very crispy skin, and light soy sauce and green onion broth was a perfect accompaniment, allowing the delicate flavors of the flounder to show itself. If you've never had flounder before, get it!  At $10.95 for a whole fish, it's quite a value.\n\nSpicy Mandarin Beef - Simple presentation with sauteed julienne green peppers and onions with tender beef. The beef glaze with a nice kick from the freshly cracked black pepper swimming it was pretty tasty - enough so that we harnessed whatever sauce was leftover on the skillet it was presented in and ate it with rice.\n\nMinced Beef Soup -Simple tasty, thick clear broth soup, with tender egg whites. Nothing to dance a jig over,  but comfort food soup.\n\nChinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - Can't go wrong here.  A good green and fresh accompaniment to the other dishes.\n\nSnow Pea Shoots - This was the favorite green dish of the night.  Simple, but it was full of flavor and offer a really tender texture. \n\nTwo Salt and Pepper Quails - a very unusual offering, two of my friends had to try it.  They were pleased.  They both agreed the quail flesh proved more flavor than chicken.  They liked how crispy it was and how it was served with ample fried garlic, jalapenos, and red peppers.\n\nBBQ Pork Chow Mein Hong Kong Style - Great smoky flavor, thin and crispy vermicelli egg noodles.  One of the better versions of this dish.\n\nComplimentary warm tapioca dessert with diced taro.  Score!", "author": "Paolo M."}

To set things right....seafood places in Hong Kong are either right by the sea (you eat outside and it's more run down), or it's some nice banquet place that can be somewhat presentable. I'm not sure how people can have wedding banquets in this place, but...alright.\n\nAnyway. We ordered a couple dishes, namely the salt and pepper prawns, the chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, the taro crispy duck, and the e-fu noodles with crab meat. Let me go over them one by one.\n\nSalt and pepper prawns: Shell's on, so prepare to get your hands dirty. The seasoning is just right, and the prawns are quite fresh. I liked it.\n\nChinese broccoli with oyster sauce: the veggies were cooked right, but the oyster sauce was...what brand did they use again? Why does it taste funny?\n\nTaro crispy duck: Crowd pleaser dish, also very filling because of the taro in it. It was good but they didn't distribute or chop the duck up enough that you have to hunt for the duck under the yummy taro-ness. Wish they would've done it right so each piece of taro gets some duck because both the duck and the taro tasted great.\n\nE-fu noodles with crab meat: Very disappointing. The crab meat is real crab meat, but other then that, nothing surprising with this dish and I can whip up a better version at home myself.\n\nOverall, it's as good as any other Cantonese restaurants, there are some good stuff I had, and some not-so-good stuff. If I ever come here again, I'd bring a huge group so I can try more of their dishes to see how the overall quality is, but so far, not very impressed.", "author": "Alice C."}

I would say this is a typical chinese restaurant but with nothing to exceptional to round up to a 4. The main thing I would tip my hat off to for this place is their freshness. The food tasted as if it was prepared from ingredients not sitting around but the flavor was not anything special. SInce this is a little further away from other chinese restaurants, Id only go here if other family members were attending. Overall its a decent chinese restaurant but nothing too amazing to recommend over another restaurant.", "author": "Robert Y."}

My family and I like to come here a lot. And it sure as hell isn't for the decor (which is . . . umm, I'm still looking for it). The ambiance of this restaurant sucks - the ceilings are high and, no offense - I'm Chinese too, Cantonese people are loud, yo. Not a date place or someplace for a nice, intimate conversation - but what can you expect? This is a REAL Chinese restaurant! No gimmicks, no novelty bullshit, it's just really decent food.\n\nDon't order the pre-set banquet meals - they're a little too pricey and overhyped, in my opinion.  Instead, come here and order yourself off the menu.  All the tofu claypots (my favorite is the salty fish and chicken - try that in the fried rice variety too, if you're salty fish fan, it's BOMB!) are yummy with a plain bowl of rice - tasty and the best kind of comfort food. The seafood is always fresh and tasty. The dry fried string beans always come piping hot, fresh and is fantastically garlicky and flavorful - same goes for their sauteed beef that comes on a hot plate. My absolute favorite is the garlic roasted (fried? Don't tell me, I really am better off not knowing) chicken! It's tender, juicy, the skin is crispy - falls right off, and there's crispy garlic bits baked into and generously scattered all over the whole thing.\n\nIt does suck to get a seat sometimes, though, and sometimes they'll get creative and push small tables together (while possibly breaking some kind of safety hazard . . . but, dude, my one track mind reads: food).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-27", "description": "Dependable and tasty Chinese food at reasonable prices. Tucked away in the far corners of the Richmond district, Superior Palace is a no-frills Chinese restaurant that serves up tasty and fresh classics with an emphasis on seafood. The food is above average and pretty much what you would expect from a decent Chinese restaurant. The crab was especially delicious and nothing like the crap that was served for 2+ times the price at HKFL (review forthcoming). The prices are about average, too, for no-frills Chinese. What I liked, however, is how clean the restaurant looked. \n\nSure, it's no-frills in a \"let's stick a random painting of Chinese flowers on the wall and call it art while covering the entire rest of the wall with scribbled menu specialties written entirely in Chinese\" way. However, it's a large space that has clean white walls, and, unlike other, more sketchy Chinese food places, the floors never seem to be scattered with those random food pieces/dropped chopsticks/dropped and/or soiled napkins that litter the floors in other no-frills joints.\n\nTheir bathrooms are also surprisingly, shockingly clean. Taking into account the locale, you really do not know what to expect when entering into the hallowed halls labeled \"Women\" (or \"Men,\" I assume, but not having visited that one, I can't really vouch for that half). Anyway, we're not talking the Park Hyatt or anything, but it's fully stocked with TP, actual honest-to-goodness pump soap, and paper towels. Yippee!\n\nAll in all, if I have to go for Chinese (which I oftentimes do considering my dad's limited adventurousness in all things epicurean), this place is A-okay in my books.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-26", "description": "At the urging of a friend, I decided to give this place a try.\n\nThey serve typical Canto dishes, and while the food is NOT top-notch, it is at least edible, and, as in the nature of most Chinese restaurants, specialize in a few dishes, while the more traditional ones are lacking in authenticity.\n\nSince this is a SEAFOOD restaurant, I let them show me a sample of their expertise.\n\n1st meal  - Catfish, fried.  Overly coated, and once cooled, became rock-hard.  Too salty.\n  - Bitter melon with beef.  Beef not tender, overall was too bitter.\n  - Beef stew in a fired hot pot.  Meat had flavor, not the broth.\n  - Deep fried pumpkin squash.  Mediocre.  No wonder it was FREE.\n  - Finally, lobster noodles.  O.K.  These ingredients have natural flavor.\n\n2nd meal - A few more different dishes, to round out their offerings.\n- Tripe in black bean sauce.  Kind of bland.\n- Prawns with Jalapenos.  Had O.K. flavor via MSG.\n- Hung Tao Yee Won Ton - Bland, with thin broth.  Much better at Kirin Restaurant on Geary.\n\nPROS  - Predictable meal.  Quality, taste, freshness was just O.K.  Would eat here for a rice plate.  Also, they feature Beef Tripe, one of my favorites that is becoming harder to find.\n\nCONS  I feel like I have to be \"on guard\" any time that I come by.  The woman who hangs out by the front door is not only annoying in that she demands to know if you're going to order something, and if you do, asks, \"why don't you order more?\".  Additionally, her voice is a most irritating kind of raspiness as she literally YELLS to all around her.  Also, I am rather annoyed that the staff will exert so much pressure to \"upsell\" their more expensive dishes, albeit only upon a select group of customers.  The last time that I was there, the 2 of us were quite astounded that the waiter, owner, owner's wife, etc. ALL approached us with the purpose of \"upselling\".  Such pressure!!  Meanwhile, a woman with her 3 children were left alone, as though the staff knew that she was on a very thin budget, with NO upselling attempted.  In fact, this woman ordered 2 low-end dishes, which totaled about 12 dollars for 4 people, while the two of us spent 38 dollars.  In fact, on my second visit to obtain a printed menu, the woman seemed annoyed that I had come in just to \"not buy anything\".  I was planning a dinner visit that evening, but as I promised her, I did show up later.\n\nAs a result, I have come to the conclusion, after 5 visits to Superior Palace for dinner, that while their specials are a good value, they come at a higher cost... that is the higher cost of their multiple attempts to upsell me.\n\nEnter at your caution.  Don't say that anyone didn't try to warn you.  It seems that even in the most subtle way, they want you to feel uncomfortable.  For example, for 2 people to order 5 dishes at full price, and the same comment is asked by the order-taker:  IS THAT ALL?  I am convinced that even if the 2 of us ordered 30 dishes, they would STILL attempt to sell us just one more high-end dish.\n\nAs for me... never again.  If I want to be abused at a Chinese restaurant, there are many others that will mistreat me for far less money.", "author": "David J."}

It seems like they're trying to improve their customer service too. It used to be that they'd present you a dish with all the residual cooking liquid or oil with the dish. Last time that I went, there was very little liquid at the bottom of the dish.", "author": "S P."}

And suprisingly, there isn't a dish that stands out amazingly.  we actually came here one time because south seafood was packed and had a wedding going on (those idiots were greedy and still took customers when there was an ongoing wedding with all the ruckus of banging chopsticks and ear piercing chinese singing)\n\nbut this was a backup sort of.  and the walnut prawns are sorta dried and looked not so fresh.  and seroiusly.  to me, you can't be serving wack walnut prawns, that's like everyone's favorite.  sweet lardish mayo on oily crisp prawns, with honey glazed walnuts??? you know each and every person will look at those as key.  \n\nbut for a cheap mediocre dinner, this place i guess can do it.  but definitely, i suggest making the inside just a tad nicer.  add some more lighting or mirrors or something.  but hey, i'm no expert.", "author": "Vincent K."}

(Ain't enough servers to serve the b-u-s-y place. Food is okie, a little salty at time. My fave here is the hot hot eggplant with tofu... yummy clay pot with rice, and garlic chicken with like this weird mustard sauce they serve it with. If u have a group, eat from the family dinner, cheap and you get pretty decent food.", "author": "Monika T."}

We were here as part of a BIG group (4 tables) and apparantly the Deluxe menu was ordered for the food kept on coming and coming. I think we had a total of about 10 dishes and we were full after about the 6th. Everything was pretty good. Stand-outs boths ways were the roasted Duck which was agreed by all as one the best we've had and the cold chicken on the opposite end (blah). Considering they were packed plus our big group the food came out quickly and over-all service was pretty good for the type of resturant.", "author": "Ed L."}

The service sucks.  You have to work hard to get their attention.  It's a small place, with tables very close to one another, and can get busy during dinner time.  I'd make a reservation for large groups.  There's also a small room off to the side that fits 3 or 4 large tables that you could have a party in.", "author": "Stacey L."}

The restaurant specializes in seafood, which was excellent, and they give you a lot of food.  This is a very Chinese place, however, so it's best experienced with a large crowd, so that you can taste many dishes.", "author": "Ray Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-04", "description": "The food here is fresh and tasty and not too greasy. It is nothing fancy, but a pretty good deal for family dinners (there's crab or lobster on the $48 dinner for 6-8 people). The cleanliness is a definite plus-I avoid the popular places like Best Panda because I lose my appetite when it's so messy and dirty! Friendly servers when we went made it a more pleasant dining experience too.", "author": "Gale H."}

The restaurant looks ok on the interior - nothing memorable but it's fine.Tables are covered with paper placemats - great for drawing on if you are so inclined.  The menu has a variety of different items. Food is good, not too salty or greasy.  Portions are reasonably sized.  We had a seafood clay pot dish that was tasty, chicken chow fun, two different vegetable dishes (tender and fresh), beef and green beans (a bit oily), soft tofu and seafood on some sort of green leaf (good flavoring but mushy - likely should have expected that since soft tofu does not hold well together in cooking), sweet and sour pork, fried whole fish, and some fried rice.  Overall the food is fine. The service isn't great but that's not unusual.  Try not to get seated right in the path where the food comes in.  The tea wasn't strong or particularly tasty.  Worth trying.", "author": "A L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-04", "description": "What can I say.... my relatives tend to be avid customers to this restaurant when we have the large family gatherings. We've gone to this location since when I was in elementary school over 20 years ago and have seen the place change hands multiple times. If I recall the current owners are the 6th ones from when a family friend owned the place. The location is difficult to obtain parking if you drive, especially for dinner since many other restaurants are nearby. The food isn't outstanding and the service is spotty at times. We normally order the set dinner menus, where there is a selection of 8-10 dishes to get a good sampling of different food items. Their soups, fried rice and vegetable dishes are always consistant. Their shrimp with honey walnut prawns is pretty good. Green onion & and ginger crab is ok, but their fish can be very bad unless you pick out of the fresh tank. Overall they are pretty cheap for the amount of food if you need to feed a large group. If you are looking for quality food items (special order menu) and more specialized chinese food I prefer Lucky Dragon down the street.", "author": "Derrick W."}

I noticed that there were only 2 of them for the whole restaurant. No hostess, just the 2 waiters. \nThe waiters kept walking passed me for few times. I waited patiently thinking that they were busy. \nFunny thing, NONE of them seem to have noticed me, it seems like they were trying very hard to avoid eye contact. \nNow I know they were busy and all, but I was hoping they would at least acknowledge my present. Nothing, nada. \nWaited for about 10 minutes and I finally walked over to the waiter station in the back area. \nAsked them if I needed to go to the kitchen myself to order food. \nAt this point, I was very annoyed. \nOne of the waiter then asked me if I wanted to eat-in or take out. \nI told them they should have more staff working. He didn't say anything back. \n\nI know it's a chinese restaurant (which most places have bad services) but still, the waiter should have tried to at least acknowledge customers, even when they were busy. \n\nSpeaking of busy, I also put blame on the owner. I mean, the place is constantly busy right? You would think that the owner would care about their customer and have enough staff. \nPlease, spend a little money that you make to hire more people, good food alone won't be not enough in the long term. \n\nI left without any food with me. I think I would rather go to another chinese rest. Horrible service. The worst.", "author": "B H."}
