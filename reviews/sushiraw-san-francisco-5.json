I don't know why it only has 3 and half stars currently because it's delicious. The sushi is super fresh all the time. Whether you order a roll, nigiri, or sashimi its always above average quality. I've introduced my friends to it, and they loved it too. Even a bar tender across the street told me her friend was visiting from Japan and agreed that sushi raw is fantastic. The environment of the restaurant is really standard, but the service is always great and friendly. I go on ladies night dates here and sip on sake with my friends. It's always a great pick with a really good happy hour most days. I have also tried their udon soup on one of San Francisco's iconically cold days and it did the trick. Would reorder. \n\nMy motto with this place \"take my money\"", "author": "Kara F."}

They started nickel and dimeing for anything extra(I ordered through an app and they refused to add spic mayo as something you paid for and would try to charge an excessive amount for it when you picked up), the quality of the meat declined drastically, and to top it all off they raised prices on their lower end items significantly. \nI loved this place but they have ripped me off, made me sick(yes the meat was that bad), and I just can't do it.

It really wasn't a lot of food so I was somewhat disappointed, especially when I'd even paid extra for a grilled fish substitution and was given such a tiny, thin portion of it.

I've tried several of their rolls and nigiri sushi and it never tastes fresh, sometimes the fish almost tastes mushy.\n\nNo matter what time or day I've visited, how slow or busy the place is, the service is just never there. I've never had rude service but the servers always have this \"I don't care\" or \"when the hell is my shift over\" attitude\n\nI went in the other day, probably for the last time and ordered a chicken teriyaki bento plate and spicy salmon roll. The bento plate was a pretty good deal I thought; came with a small serving of tempura, and three pieces of nigiri for $15. That's about all that was good though. My salad came slopped in a horrendous tasting dressing, the entire bowl of lettuce was starting to brown (took one bite and left the rest uneaten) chicken was overcooked, tempura over battered and drenched in what seemed like seriously old oil, and the fish was not fresh at all. My salmon roll actually came out decently enough but I think the best part of my meal was actually the miso soup and green tea.\n\nAs I said, don't think I'll stop here again when in the neighborhood. There's a new place, Raijin, which I've tried several times as well now... Seems promising and a hell of a lot better than what's currently available on this little lower Haight strip", "author": "Pauline T."}

I arrived early at 7:03, and had to wait a few minutes because I was early. No biggie, and the food was prepared quickly. I also asked for extra soy sauce, and they gave me 4 packets!\n\nThe red dragon roll (avocado and shrimp tempura inside, spicy tuna on top) was quite filling and tasted quite fresh. The spicy tuna held its composure (I.e., there weren't discernible chunks of tuna, which I suppose some people prefer, but I like when it has a soft texture) and the shrimp tempura stayed crispy. Definitely will order again and perhaps try other rolls too (if you're looking to get a bigger meal with the same fish components, the red dragon roll costs the same as one spicy tuna and one shrimp tempura roll).", "author": "Julia N."}

The beer and sake was buy one get one free, which was a thumbs up for me.  Then there was a select number of rolls and all only had about $2 off.  I ordered the rock n' roll, eclipse and red dragon.  Rock n' roll was just your ordinary roll, but the other two, was all filling.  Felt like they stuffed it was pureed and sauce filled spicy tuna.  And the chunk of Philly cream cheese in the eclipse was massive, so it was all that I tasted.  I guess I'm a girl who likes to taste texture of the fish, and not a mushed up mucky muck.   \n\nThe bill still came out pretty high for a happy hour, but at least a decent crowd started coming thru by the time that I left at around 5ish.  It was alright, but nothing to say, it blew me away.  Just avoid the puree and you may have fun, with their packed full menu of choices.", "author": "Janice F."}

As she mentioned the restaurant is small and narrow with an upstairs section for more seating (ideal for a party).  \n\nStaff was extremely friendly & attentive.  The bf & I shared an order of the deep fried California roll ($7.95).  I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento ($9.95) which came with mixed tempura and three pieces of sushi, as well as the standard soup and salad.  He got the three choice bento ($13.95) with short ribs, chicken teriyaki, & shrimp tempura. The roll wasn't bad, but was cut super thin!  It was hard to get the roll to our mouths without any filling falling out or the roll falling apart.  The soup was a little salty.  I liked the salad dressing though, as it was more Asian style vs. the usual mayo based dressing that you see at many Japanese restaurants.  My bento was enough for me.  The chicken teriyaki was standard & the tempura batter was good, and totally was perfect for my tummy for drinking later on that night.  I gave the sushi to bf since I don't really eat fish.  All of us also shared bottles of Wakatake Sake (cold) that went down oh so smooth & didn't taste like booze, which means that it's a lethal creeper later on!  \n\nI thought it was amusing how one of the waitresses kept saying that the sake bottle was tiny, and that a roll was too tiny for three people to share.  I kept thinking to myself, \"Why is everything so tiny here?!\"  All in all, Sushi Raw is not the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to, but it's not bad.

Four dishes that really stood out to me was the salmon and tuna tartar, Kobe beef, Otoro sashimi (aka fatty tuna) and Truffled Hirame. The salmon and tuna tartar was very unique. It was a dish with shrimp chips surrounding guacamole filled with salmon and tuna. It was a tasty and crispy appetizer. Next, he Kobe beef was fantastic. It tasted as great as it smelled! The beef was very juicy and delicious that I'm 100% ordering that every time. Also, the Otoro sashimi was just as fresh as the salmon I mentioned before. Very well done to the point where I don't think I can find this quality anywhere else in S.F. The Truffled Hirame's sauce's flavor was very distinctive.

There's nothing wrong with that, just thought I would let you know.

The nigiri is extremely well-priced, fresh and buttery, but not much else met my perfectly accessible standards.\n\nCame to the restaurant to sit at the bar and have an indulgent meal with personal attention by a sushi chef. We got our bar seats, but not once during our stay were we actually tended to by the chef across the counter from us, who looked stressed out and hurried. We did receive good service by the hostesses, though as the night wore on and the place paced towards capacity, our service dwindled to the point that we almost reconsidered our post-roll follow-up of unagi and o-toro. Alas, we are sushi fiends, my boyfriend and I, and a bit of neglect didn't succeed in stopping us. \n\nWe ordered the island roll and the jalape\u00f1o roll as the gist, with some saba and a seaweed salad to start us off. The menu is a little small as far as rolls go, and especially as far as rolls with only fresh, uncooked fish goes - many of the offerings included shrimp tempura or imitation crab meat. The rolls were unorthodox and tasty, but it should be noted on the menu that the jalape\u00f1o is cooked and that the island roll sits in a pool of vinegar. An interesting mouthfeel for the latter, my appreciation for it only took hold towards the final bite. \n\nThis is a good spot to take groups of people, as most of the patrons belonged to large parties, and there's a raised section perfect for taking sake bombs.", "author": "Jake m."}

Will the sushi melt in your mouth in a more luxurious way if you're at Okoze? Sure. You'll also drop a benjamin at a place like that.

Because otherwise, I could eat the month's family food budget in one sitting as a teen. \n\nSo the local place needed to be good. Not great, but good. First came Hanabi. The tuna was eh, the salmon was less than eh, and the halibut actually turned my stomach. The interior feels dilapidated, a little dirty, and definitely old. Bummer. Never went back. Next was Amasia's Hides, which has the distinction of running a 50% special on sake. Every day. The fish was all eh. I remember getting the tobiko and feeling like it tasted like finely ground gravel. Never went back.\n\nNext up were Sushi Time and Domo; both are fantastic, among the best in the city (up there with Shimo, thank you Danny Ronen).\n\nSushi Raw is the middle ground. It isn't as fabulous as Domo, but that  restaurants (and Sushi Time and Eiji, another great one) each seat about 12 people, max. Sushi Raw seats closer to 50. The waitresses are really cute - the first time I went it was Halloween and they were all in ears and tails. The fish is good; I had excellent Salmon last time. The spicy tuna is a little too much on the spicy and flavorless side. The 49er roll is good. The double hamachi has too much mayo. And its probably less expensive than Domo, about the same as Sushi Time. \n\nThe interior is nice, the service prompt (and cute), and this place beats the s%&t out of Iraqi food. I mean, what the hell was that place, anyway? So to review, in Duboce/Lower Haight/Hayes Valley/N. Castro Sushi choices, it goes:\n1) Domo\n2) Sushi Time\n3) Sushi Raw\n4) Barracuda\n5) Amasia's Hides\n6) Everything else in walking distance\n7) Hanabi\n\nIts worth going to.", "author": "Mark G."}

If you are tired of boring raw vegetables wrapped in rice and seaweed, typical of every sushi place I have ever been to you MUST come to Sushi Raw and be prepared for some amazing delights.  Flip to the back of the menu to the vegetarian section.  \n\nTHE BEST Veg roll - the Pink Lady.  This is a roll wrapped in light pink soy paper and shaped like a dew drop.  They place 4 dew drops next to each other to form 2 little pink hearts, and the rest of the dew drops are served in a martini glass - I kid you not.  Inside these little gems you will find tempura asparagus, mushroom carrot, sweet potato, and mango...and swirled on your plate for your dipping pleasure is a sweet mango sauce that is literally to die for.  This roll is not made for soy sauce so don't ruin your experience by using it!  Simply savor the sweetness of the roll you have rightfully chosen, feel special because your fish-eating friends do not get their sushi served in a martini glass, and get full because its really big and so worth the higher price.\n\nOne time I ordered the Swamp Roll which, when compared to the Pink Lady is just ok.  But really nothing can compare to that thing, so if you are into a more savory (soy sauce dipping) roll this is for you.  Its got sweet potatoes on the inside and seaweed salad on top...shaped like a little caterpillar and also comes with sauce on the plate.  \n\nThe only reason I give 4 stars is because the service can be really slow, unless its the end of the night - then they are super fast.  \n\nAlso, their happy hour is amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-06", "description": "There are not many sushi options in Lower Haight, but thankfully this one delivers. This place sits where Baghdad Nights used to be; too bad I never tried Nights out before it went the way of the dodo. Checked it out  during the Lower Haight Art Walk this past week and was happily surprised. Disclaimer: I have lost my passion for sushi and this is the first time I eat sushi in a very long time.\n\nAmbiance (4): It could have been the art walk going on, but the energy was nice and everybody seemed happy to be there. That to me is always a good sign; good food = happy people. Lots of art on the wall, great marble/granite/something bar that you don't actually mind sitting at, and nothing pretentious about it.\n\nFood (4): I love grilled squid and when this shows up in the menu, it's getting ordered. The key to grilled squid is that it has to taste good without the aioli/mayo sauce, otherwise it's crap dressed up with fat. Mind you, if there is sauce, something will get dipped and I did dunk some rolls into it. Don't call out blasphemy, just yet, plenty of the rolls are topped with sauce at a lot of modern sushi joints. We had some eel/avocado rolls, some spicy tuna and more tuna on top rolls, and some eel/cream cheese rolls, and they were all great. \n\nThe specialty rolls all have fancy names and the presentation is nice, bordering on a little over the top, but they tasted good so I did not mind it at all. We did not have any sashimi, but I appreciated that the little storage compartment had a thermometer showing the temp which makes you a little more certain that they are keeping the stuff at the right temp. For dessert we had mochi and green tea cheesecake. Both solid, nothing extraordinary, but I find the subtle flavors suitable for a Japanese restaurant and don't need some over the top raspberry shenanigans to end my meal.\n\nService (3): Could have used more attention and the constant swapping of who helped us out I found disconcerting.\n\nValue (4): Good prices and they had a 2-for-1 beer deal that sure helped massage the bill. Overall tab was about 50 for two large beers, 2 specialty rolls, 1 regular roll, 1 squid, 2 desserts. Good value in my book.\n\nOverall: I am very happy to have tried out some really good restaurants in the Lower Haight area that really make it stand out as one of the best SF neighborhoods. Along with Acme Burgerhaus, RNM, the Grind Cafe, Raja, and others, this is one of the restaurants in the Lower Haight area that are going into the regular rotation.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

After work, we hopped on the J and found our way over to Haight. They're still running their Grand Opening special at Sushi Raw, but we didn't want 2 for 1 (or even 1 for 1) hot sake. The bill was 10% off, though, which I basically just gave back to the restaurant in the form of extra tip... er... anyway. I tip generously, maybe compulsively so.\n\nOur waitress and all other staff were friendly and attentive. I love the metal binding on the menus. Just noticed on my way out that it matches the doorway, too, and some of the other restaurant decor. Industrial chic seems like a strange contrast with cherry blossoms, especially for a Japanese restaurant and in this neighborhood, but hey, if it works for them, right?\n\nI sipped some miso soup. It's ordinary miso soup that you would get in most restaurants, but it's yummy. (I'm glad whenever they don't give you a spoon. You're supposed to sip it from the bowl like a giant tea cup!) We split the dragon roll and the spicy salmon roll, which were both your fairly standard westernized rolls, but done very well. We also split a stunning Eclipse roll that stood up in an impressive arc shape on the plate. The special rolls aren't that expensive here, and the chefs put a lot of effort into the presentation (as it should be, right?).\n\nI accidentally startled a waitress who brought us the bill too early, because I had ordered tiramisu and I was confused when she brought me something other than food. I felt so bad for bluntly interrupting her! She looked so sad =( I found the tiramisu forgettable, but it's not my favorite dessert, so I don't really want to hold that against them.", "author": "Sharon W."}

Overall, the fish quality and service exceeded my expectations. So glad to have another option in the area besides Hanabi (which is decent, but not fantastic). \n\nA more detailed breakdown:\n\nGreat:\n\"Lover's roll\" (spicy tuna with albacore on the outside): 5 stars. Albacore was melt in your mouth delicious, and overall the balance was very nice. They even did black/orange alternating roe for Halloween :) \n\nTwo for one beers - awesome\n\nService - attentive and generally good \n\nNot too bad:\nI felt like someting heartier too, so split a chicken teriyaki rice place with the bf. The chicken was a little bland, and nothing to write home about, but serviceable. (Miso, salad, etc. was nice) \n\nRock and roll -- not as good as the other roll, a little tiny bit chewy. \n\nThe ambiance was a little bit weird, though welcoming. It's a great space, with a slightly elevated mezzanine beyond the tables in the front and the bar. I say weird because they have some beautiful Asian decor, like a huge cherry blossom branch behind the sushi bar, but then an eclectic collection of paintings on the wall leading up to the mezzanine. I can only describe the paintings as some sort of collective pop culture subconscious run through a Salvadore Dali filter. \n\nAnyway, overall very impressed and looking to coming back again.

The last time we tired to eat there, we saw they were open but by the time we had found parking, they were closed!  So this time, we left the car and walked in to see what specials come with their \"Grand Opening\".  Two-for-one drinks were nice, but not enough to convince me to make it a habit.\n\nFirst of all, the fish is very fresh.  I tried the Maguro (tuna), Hamachi (yellow tail) and Sake (salmon) and each were expertly prepared.  At $4.50 for a pair of each, you get what you pay for.  Sushi Raw is a tad on the expensive side, but at least they deliver on quality.  The cheif was very nice and offered us a range of \"special\" fish and rolls, but we couldn't really figure out what they were. I tend not to stray into mackerel and shellfish territory anyway, but he did seem to have many fresh specials.\n\nThey have some very artful rolls.  We tried the Dragon, and the Haight Street Roll, both were very good.  The bento box comes on an artful plate, is a good helping of food, and comes with a salad and miso.\n\nSome sushi bars present masterful blends of fresh fish, art, and flavors to produce the best sushi.  Sushi Raw blends good food with a good atmosphere to serve up a good dinning experience that fits the price.  \n\nI would recommend Sushi Raw to anyone with a little bit of money to spend who enjoys fresh fish, modern art, and a friendly and helpful staff who shout \"Irrashaimase!\" (welcome!) to everyone who walks in the door.", "author": "T.

My boss decided to cancel his dinner reservation for 10 people and asked me to order in sushi... he wanted to impress his friends and have the food there fast.  I started to panic!  Then, I called Sushi Raw on Haight for a last minute order.  My budget was $300 and I had to please my picky boss and his guests.  I did not even have a copy of the menu, I just asked them to send  their best rolls. WOW.  They delivered 35 creative, fresh, colorful rolls beautifully arranged on party platters- all in about one hour!  They called to check in and make sure we were happy and the delivery got there so quickly.  I was always a fan of the sushi here, but in addition to the great food the service is wonderful!  Thank you!", "author": "R G."}

I was not a happy camper when I saw a Japanese restaurant open up blocks from my dear Hanabi (R.I.P). I thought it was worth a try but as I walked in I knew we'd have a complicated relationship. Sure, the 2-for-1 beer & sake special is awesome! However, it's not so awesome when you can't even flag down the wait staff to tell them a half hour after ordering that they forgot your drinks. To Sushi Raw's defense, they seem slammed. I went on a Sunday night and the wait time was approx 15 mins. It was the kind of situation where the staff greets you kindly, sits you down asap, and then ignores you when you want to order and receive your food.\nAs far as the sushi, it was pretty good! -  better than Hanabi's.... but for me, what matters more is the soup (the RAMEN, specifically). Sushi Raw only has 1 type of ramen and it is rather underwhelming. I learned from the Hanabi owners that the owners of Sushi Raw are Korean, not Japanese. I have no idea if this would  influence the taste/style but It's kinda interesting, right?\nI may try Sushi Raw again, but I'm betting the new Japanese place that's opening where Hanabi was is going to be my ramen sanctuary!", "author": "Nicole L."}

Sushi Raw is the perfect stop when you need soup to keep you warm or a healthier meal alternative.", "author": "Makela C."}

I don't know... its not super spectacular. I'd rather order delivery from Blue Fin in the Richmond and deal with the wait.", "author": "J J."}

I consider myself a sushi connoisseur and I have to say that although the fish is fresh they do not cut it right. The pieces are a bit too thick so it doesn't melt in your mouth the way it should even though you can tell it would if it was a better cut. Also I happened to be there at the end of the night when they were closing and the owner did not treat her staff well and didn't seem to care that we saw her yelling \"HARDER, HARDER!\" to the guy mopping up the floor. I felt really bad for him. I also understand wanting to get out of work early but I think the customer should always be first and I found myself waiting for them to put things away before getting my order fulfilled. I would never go back here for the shear reason that I did not like the way the staff was treated or myself for that matter. I felt pushed out even though I was done with my meal at the exact time they closed. Also my boyfriend left his card there and they charged him twice!", "author": "D K."}

The atmosphere is pleasent and clean, the service is fast, people are helpful, and the best tempura I've ever had. Been going here for a while and love it every time.", "author": "Siannan G."}

I've eaten sushi here three times and have always left disappointed.  I found the rice really dry and rolls didn't have that much meat in them.  I also love how they've had the grand opening sign up for many months now :)", "author": "Sheila K."}

Go here if you don't want to spend the extra $50+ at Tsunami or Cebo, but don't go here expecting anything other than average Americanized sushi.. which is fine for a snack with a few beers.", "author": "Jon G."}

I was surprised at how 'swanky' this place was. really cool art, eclectic music, comfortable yet modern and stylish ambiance, and the staff was super friendly. we were starving, so we went a little crazy. we started with a big bottle of sapporo and some cold sake. they have an awesome 2 for 1 beer and sake special.  then onto a tempura appetizer, which was honestly THE best tempura i have ever had. the vegetables/shrimp were so fresh, and the batter just melts in your mouth. then the chef's choice sashimi plate. 12 pieces of amazing sashimi for only $15! then the caterpillar roll...which was decent. and the spicy tuna roll, which was only $5 and delicious! the service was great.  everyone was so friendly and really attentive. we\"ll definitely be going back. soon.", "author": "Kristin F."}
