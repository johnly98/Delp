Standing in line for the coat check (awesome coat checker!) a woman walked up beside me, didn't acknowledge me, didn't make eye contact, didn't say anything, just slowly inched past me.  When she finally was fully past me I said, \"uh, I'm in line.\"  She turned to me and said, \"I own the bar.\"  Now, I know the Stud is owned by a collective, so perhaps she's part of the collective.  But if you joined a collective so that you could tell your patrons \"I own the bar\" rather than \"I'm glad you're here\" then maybe the collective needs to re-evaluate its priorities.\n\nNot \"Happy Pride\"...not \"thanks for coming\"......not \"excuse me\"...not \"I work here and I'm not heading to the coat check I'm just trying to get to the office\"...just \"I own the bar.\"\n\nAs some of the other reviews have noted, the Stud is an SF institution.  I've been there many times.  I want the Stud to be around for many years.  And, honestly, everyone else was great...from the enthusiastic, kind coat checker, to the bartenders who jumped to offer me a drink even though the bar a really busy, to the staff collecting the remaining drinks at 2 am.  They were all professional and positive and it was great to see that kind of spirit in the place.  So, the 4 stars are for them...and it could've been 5...but I really had to resist making it 1.\n\nI left with a bad feeling because of that one person who felt they needed to assert their importance in order to feel good about themselves.

My last two experiences here have been exceedingly meh - which is a genuine shame, because queer & weird space in San Francisco is increasingly rare and special.\n\nIt comes down to an attitude problem, which - as someone who works in nightlife - is all too common among staff at places struggling to pay their rent. Ordered a couple cocktails the other night from the one bartender on staff and asked what was going on, since the bar was eerily quiet. This person was hella dismissive and obviously irritated to serve me.\n\nMy other experiences have been fine enough - I've never stumbled into an event I've needed to see or stick around for. It's a bit too off the beaten path for me to make a trip just for the hell of it. I live in Sunset and often make SoMa pilgrimages - but I do so to venues that spend half a minute trying to connect with me and make me want to return. I haven't had enough experience at STUD to say this, but I get the faint impression that this is one of those sacred queer spaces, where everyone is so politicized and potentially pissed at everything around them. It's bad that the vibe rubs off.\n\nOh, good cocktails though. Love all the sparkles on the walls.

The cover on a Friday night was $10 which, for someone who is from NYC, is actually pretty good. There were lots of wonderful drag performances to fill this little straight girls hearts desire for men in makeup between RuPaul seasons. The only thing that bothered me (and unfortunately it bothered me so much that it drove me to write this review) was the bitter lesbian serving drinks in the back theater, Bernie. When I approached the \"drink station,\" which in most other states is the area where servers stop at the bar to order, she asked me to step out of the way of it. So I did.. Thinking it was because a server was going to be picking up drinks there soon. But, being a smart cookie, I quickly discovered it was just the space to order drinks at the bar. California is weird like that. Apparently you don't just order from anywhere along the bar, there are designated spaces for that. Anyway, soon after- a nice gay gentleman asked me what she said just as she was yelling at me again about standing in the way, and offered to order me the drink I wanted with his order. All I wanted was a fucking bottle of water. Of which, regardless of the cost, I would have tipped for. So fuck that angry dyke. She never stopped to ask me of I wanted to order anything. She just kept yelling about how I was in the way. It's enough of a reason to keep me from ever going back there again. It's a simple case of being present and reflecting the kind of respect you would ask of anyone else in return.", "author": "Hallie G."}

I honestly did. But my friend has a thing for the younger homos, and he likes going here. And so I go with him.\n\nSince my initial review, I've seen a significant change in the place. It's so much nicer, and the staff has their stuff together. \n\nThe DJ has some great music list, from Top 40's to awesome mash-ups. You can find some amazing stuff on here that you start out thinking, \"What the fuck?\" and end up saying \"Hell yeah!\"\n\nMy other favorite is that you don't want more than a minute for a drink. I wish to pay a big tribute to this to my favorite bartender, Lu. This woman rocks. Like, \"Holy f-ing shit and what the hell wow!\" kinda rocks. She was on top of my orders at all times, she was sweet and friendly. Even when there was a big ol group of gay boys thirsty for liquor, she held her cool, poured them drinks, and did it all without breaking a sweat. WOW! Plus, her drinks are actually something that you can sip on and enjoy, rather than other bartenders I know that you have to choke them down because they are so strong or mixed so badly. She knows what she's doing, she does it fast, and she does it with a smile. That's my kind of lady!\n\nDefinitely check this place out on a Saturday night.

I would give it three, but I'm compensating for my mood.  I went here last night (Saturday) for Hot Mess.\n\nThe decor is a little to be desired, but it was interesting to look at all the randomness decorating the walls: picture of Jesus, toki dolls, and other odd stuff.  \n\nThe place was completely packed, to the point where I was getting pissed off because people wouldn't get out of my way, but reflecting on that, they really couldn't move either.\n\nThe DJ was hit-and-miss for me.  I loved most of the music, but when he randomly he mixed in 80s hits I was saddened.  I wasn't really digging the crowd, but I can see people who would like it.  The guy I thought was the most attractive was the bartender.  Yum...\n\nThe bathroom is to be avoided at all costs.  It's completely disgusting.  A curtain divides the toilet from the sink, and the urinal is a trough.  The door to the bathroom is small saloon swing style.\n\nThe dancers were alright.  I wasn't necessarily digging them, but again some people would.  They did look better than the ones at Hunters in San Jose.  One of the dancers thought he was hot shit, but he definitely wasn't.  He actually was semi-slutty--if that's even possible.  \n\nBy all means, this wasn't my favorite bar, but I feel I'd have more fun when I go back in better spirits.  I'll definitely hit it up to see the bartender again.  \n\nThe parking was painless, so don't worry about that.  Just make sure you want to spend some time here since it is a $5 cover.\n\nUpdate:  I've started going here more on Saturdays.

I was happy to be there, had looked forward to it for weeks, came early so I could get a good place for the show. But waiting for it, packed like pigs in a slaughterhouse, every surface sticky (although I didn't mind for the moment), you turned the volume up to 11 and forgot about it. I had my fingers in my ears and they still rang afterwards. I kept my hopes up--even though assholes all around me were smashing glasses and pushing their way forward and picking fights and the music sucked and the stage was too small and too low and it started late and well, eventually my hopes started flagging I suppose. And then the show started, and the speakers still blared painfully, and I said to myself \"nope, I don't think this'll work.\" \n\nThanks for understanding. I didn't think I was gonna get my money back, but I asked about the sound anyways so that, you know, somebody might fix it. \"We don't have a 'sound guy,'\" said the Tranny at the door. Who does the sound then? \"We have a DJ or something. I don't know. You should ask the bartender.\" Oh yes, the bartender, who is trying to serve drinks to a crowd twice what the fire marshall says is a good idea. He'll know what to do. Well, I'm leaving because the event here isn't safe, isn't well-planned, isn't worth the money, most definately isn't in a good location, and doesn't have cheap drinks which might make up for all the other stuff. I want my money back. \n\nThanks for looking me up and down, giving me a derogatory look that probably meant \"strait, drunk, or stupid,\" so that I knew exactly what the game was.

I don't have to walk six blocks in rain/cold/darkness to go clubbing. It's located on 9th and Harrison (The Stud), so street parking within a block is no longer an urban myth.\n\n-It's got a better looking crowd. Not to mention that the demographic is mostly 22-28 yr old, white, male, and rather fit. Plus the \"I think that one is hot\" percentage is 35% instead of the 12% at Boy Bar!\n\n-The music quality is better. I'm a dancing snob (queen, whatever), and my ass was going like whoa the majority of the time I was there.\n\n-There's a VIP-ish area i.e. a leather \"bed\" with wrought-iron head/footboards and a sheer muslin curtain around the sides, shutting you out/in. It's also prime location for the...oil?...wrestling. Which leads to the next and final difference.\n\n-The gogo dancers actually take off their clothes (accidentally, of course) all in the name of wrestling. On the pool table is an actual pool, albeit a blow-up kiddie one. The gogo boys get in it, get greased by the MC who is squirting liquid(s) at them, and start wrestling. One second, I see two \"dancers\" go at it high school-style, and the next I see testicles and a naked bum. Accidental? Uh huh. Suuuure.... It's fine from afar, but I worried about getting too close to the pool and getting my clothes (and hair) splashed with oil. \n\nGod knows that there are stains that can't be washed out....\n\nGo.

Shirtless, hairless, and Asian, and up til a few seconds ago seemingly straight. A few potential suitors start to gravitate towards him. He is the Death Star and they are competing Millennium Falcons. A gentleman in a tux approaches my wife and myself, whose mouths are agape watching the scene unfold. \n\"Is he dating anyone?\" he asks.\n\"At this moment, I'm gonna have to say he is available for anything... I think\" was my reply.\nHe smiles and disappears into the crowd.\nHow did we get here?? I laughingly ask myself. I can tell you how. We had all started off at Bootie where we were dancing the night away when one our group starts to complain. \"We always go to the straight bars... Just once I wanna go to my bars!\" Bye bye Bootie. Hello Stud!!\nThe DJ at Stud is on point. She controls the packed wall-to-wall sweaty crowd easily. After a few minutes of acclimation we are back to dancing and having a great time. Looking back I wonder if my experience would have been different without my wife there. I'm not egotistical enough to think I would have been hit on all night, but would I have been more self-conscious about dancing in a sea of gay men?? Either way, I'm not worrying about that, because I am dancing with a pretty lady all night. The crowd, the staff, the music at Stud... all great. I would have no qualms about coming back and getting down. \n\nBut whatever happened to my friend in the cage?? Well, that's his story to tell you....", "author": "Bucky K."}
