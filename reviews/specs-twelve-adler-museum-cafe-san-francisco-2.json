These are just some of the reasons why Specs' remains of of my favorite (cash-only) dive bars in North Beach.\n\nI used to frequent this bar a lot back when I lived in the hood 15-years ago. Located across the street from City Lights Bookstore, this watering hole really transports you the SF of yesteryear (if that's a word). I'm pleased to report that 15-years later, Specs is still the same. Nothing (and I mean NOTHING) has changed about this place. The gruff bartenders still give you dirty looks if you take too long to order or request a frou-foru drink. This place is strictly beer and hard booze, folks. If you want a fancy-schmancy Cosmo or Apple-tini, go to Tosca's next door.\n\nMy group of 7 and I squatted at a round table last Saturday night. We nursed a bunch of White Russians and Fernet, while nibbling on blocks of cheese. There's plenty of people-watching to be done at Specs. And by that, I mean there are a number or irregular regulars (everyone from Beatniks to hipsters to borderline hobos).

I had always loved going there as it was a little hidden gem in that tourist ridden area.   The last couple of years, the clientele has changed a bit.   After a long night we ended up there on New Year's. I ran to the ladies room as they were yelling for last call.  While I was in there I could hear two women verbally and physically abusing another woman and could tell it was getting violent and racial.  As I was stepping out a man walked by the ladies room and the women jumped him.  One started hitting him and the other knocked him down the stairs.  I'm not going to lie, I got around it as fast as possible.  I ran and told my husband.  He saw the guy come flying down the stairs and was trying to help him. We tried to tell the bartenders but they were more concerned with kicking everyone out.  We waited outside to see what was happening.  The man who had been attacked was trying to call the police and waiting for her to come out.  The bar managers kept saying they wanted nothing to do with it, even though it happened right in front of them.  The woman in the restroom who had been getting attacked prior to that came out and started telling people what happened as well.  She said that the bartenders were not letting the attacker out as she was \"afraid\" people were waiting for her, and they were trying to let her out the back door.  When people started knocking on the door, the bartenders said that it was not their responsibility that these people were attacked there and they would have to handle it themselves and they let her leave without calling the police.  My husband is a lawyer and quickly grabbed the two people who had been attacked by her and gave him his card.  He does not practice this kind of litigation, but we have friends who do.  He told them because this was happening in the bar during the hours it was open it WAS ABSOLUTELY their responsibility to handle it.  Yesterday we heard from the gentleman who was pushed down the stairs, and he went to the hospital with a concussion.  My husband put him in touch with another lawyer, and apparently he is looking at suing the bar for damages.  There are so many great bars in the area, I'm thinking there are others I can go to where if something like this happens, bar management will get a handle on it. I was shocked at how badly Specs let this escalate.  Not a great way to see 2017 start. We won't be going back.", "author": "J J."}

In part because the bar patrons were lively and made a lot of noise while cheering on familiar shots or cameos by the bartender made this a very enjoyable evening.\n\nThey have Sierra Nevada on tap so I was happy.  Cool bartenders and loud music played softly so one can actually enjoy good conversation without shouting.\n\nTwo of my first impressions turned out to be right.  The crowd is a good mix of friendly North Beach locals and modern day hippies, and maybe because of film night this was a very popular place on a Sunday evening.\n\nThe stuff on the wall wasn't very historical unless you consider how old they are.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-30", "description": "How can a local saloon merit a five-star rating despite the following facts? :  The place hasn't changed its interior decoration in thirty years. It's often overrun with the seventy-something equivalent of Williamsburg hipsters in aging, salty, faux-communists and self-consciously declared 'artist' types. Even if you've been going here for thirty years you're still likely to be looked upon as a clueless newcomer subtracting from the joint's authenticity. If you have been going here for a while you're likely to sit next to some thirty year-old blowhard who discovered the place three weeks ago and is waxing philosophic to the young, uneasy-looking cheeserettes next to him on the bar's 'history', Specs' merchant marine connection, and the phallic whale bone on the wall (all things you could easily pick up in one drunken visit.)\n\nBecause none of this matters. To both its absolute credit and demise, Specs never changes and as long as the man himself is making the rounds in North Beach and signing the rent checks this will remain a fact. He's loyal to his bartenders and they to him, coming back to the place after extended hiatuses. They make a mean Irish coffee (only having boosted the price a buck recently) using the same archaic blender to gently stir the cream since 1971. When they bumped the draft taps up from only Bud to Anchor and eventually a few more it remained the central topic of conversation regarding how the place had 'changed' for about fifteen years. It provides an excellent counter to Vesuvio across the street and general refuge from the touristy onslaught. It's also a great counter to the Tosca vibe next door and a drunken respite from Sean Penn-seekers and less-homey 'don't put your feet up on the furniture' admonishments. \n\nSpecs is what it is, and that it's remained so for almost forty-five years is one of those inspiring facts that one can only cling to with apprehension. The man himself is a salty pleasure, neither kissing up to patrons nor dismissing them, and over the years seems to have taken his real pleasure from mixing it up with both regulars and newcomers (none more than attractive young females) who are generally delighted to discover that he owns the place. But anyone who's been around the joint for a while has to wonder what will become of things post The Man? It doesn't seem possible that the next generation could maintain as he has for this long and one hopes there's a solid succession plan in place complete with detailed instruction book. Of the three (Vesuvios, Specs and Tosca) if you had to pick one whose removal or upheaval would permanently alter an important link to North Beach's past, it would be this place.

The fact that it's North Beach location subjects it to a horde of tourists on the weekends might detract from this somewhat, but doesn't diminish it completely.\r\n\r\nWhat you see inside is a more than just a snapshot from a single period or culture.  Browsing the walls and ceilings exposes one to a broad swath of San Francisco history that changes it's gist and period with every movement of the eye.  There's stuff from the 70's that boomers can relate to.  There are relics from the 60's that ex-hippies can appreciate.  There's city-specific history from World War II that your parents might have fond memories of.  Check out the old artifacts from the Sutro baths, and you'll see things that might even give your grandparents the warm-and-fuzzies.\r\n\r\nEven though a similar collection of artifacts could no doubt be amassed, it's haphazard assembly and mishmash arrangement weave a bizarre quilt of history whose evolution over a period of 40 or more years can't be faked.  Everywhere you look, there are pictures, papers, scribblings....some framed, some not. Some are tacked to the walls at the corners, displaying a gradual yellowing that only age can bring about and a soft curvature that's only created by decades of gentle gravitational pull.  It seems that more recent placements of items have had respect for what was existed there before, creating a delightful asymmetry that bears more witness to history than it does decorative talent.\r\n\r\nIf you're around during the weekend, pop by mid-afternoon when a smattering of the old guard locals will chat politics for hours on end.  The after-work crowd can be pretty interesting too.  Late mornings and early afternoons are hit-and-miss....sometimes it's open, sometimes it's not. Weekend nights usually draw a crowd....the tourists come in, the music goes up, and it doesn't take long for the regulars to head for the door.  Regardless, pop by to get an eye full of history...stick around for awhile if you can squeeze your way into a conversation with a group of the regulars.  But have a plan B if the tourists are about.

Most people ignored the drunks even when they would stumble upon them and bombard their conversations. The regulars or perhaps City dwellers were used of this occurrence and simply ignored them as much as possible.

This was in 1982.\n\nSince 1968, Specs Twelve Adler Museum Cafe -- Specs to you -- has thrived as a North Beach holy spot\n\nIt was a sad day in Specs' history when the door connecting the bar to the upstairs strip club was closed off, corking the stream of scantily clad women who ventured down. The bartender, patrons and owner of the North Beach saloon dealt with the convulsive change in a traditional way: They had a drink.\n\nThe bar, which is formally called Specs Twelve Adler Museum Cafe and was opened in 1968 in an alley off Columbus Avenue in San Francisco, has been home to a menagerie of misfits, from strippers and poets to longshoremen and merchant marines. A sign reading, \"Please mind your head'' hangs above the bar next to the genitalia of a walrus. A photo of Ronald Reagan stretching his legs includes the homemade caption, \"One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.\"\n\nThe bar is a slice of a bawdier San Francisco, a foil for the modern day Internet cafe, a dimly lit place that inspires conversation, debate and impromptu poetry readings. \n\nI remeber the Handwriting Lady.

I love taking out-of-town guests here as it has that feeling of old school SF.  Whenever I'm here I always feel like I'm the only person who knows about the place even though I know it's hardly a secret.\r\n\r\nIt's always confusing setting up a meetup there...some people call it Spec's, others the Adler Museum and still others \"that place in the corner in North Beach\". You'll figure it out though.\r\n\r\nSimple place with a nice feel to it unless your date likes to always order chocolate martinis like mine does.  I would stick to beer and simple concoctions of harder juice at this place.\r\n\r\nThe bric-a-brac hanging on the walls makes for good conversation once you get done talking about how confused you all were in finding the place.\r\n\r\nI've never had a problem with the Irish bartender but I can see how people would.  One time he berated a bachelor party that was getting noisy (\"PIPE DOWN!\") and another time a group of guys smoking pot outside the bar.  He told us that he doesn't have a problem with pot but \"He doesn't like the pipes!!\"  I found all of this funny (when was the last time you heard someone ask someone else to pipe down?) but if you get treated rudely yourself it's certainly off-putting.\r\n\r\nYou'll tend to meet a ton of local characters here.  Once I was drinking whiskey with a guy who was 93 and had a ton of crazy old school San Francisco stories.  Keep an eye out for Specs himself (you'll know him when you see him); he routinely hands out business cards and is quite a dapper fellow so keep your eyes on your lady!", "author": "Steve B."}

Finally locating it, I was amazed by the decor.  I never in a million years expected this kind of dive bar in the middle of North Beach.  Junk is EVERYWHERE, which makes for great conversation and really gives the place character.  Whiskey shots ensued with the bartender and every time I've been to this bar since it's a tradition for me to have at least one shot of Jameson during my stay.  \n\nOne of the most random experiences I've had here occurred when a man in a full 19th century fancy suit quietly strolled in and sat next to me.  The bartender took one look at him, pulled out a huge wheel of cheese and within minutes had a platter for him- I kid you not.  Later on, the man went out to buy sushi for the bartenders and himself, leaving the cheese as a \"gift\" to my friend and me.  That's what I love about this place- the comfortable familiarity with random characters and how down to earth everyone is.\n\nOn a side note, the dive aspect of this bar results in terrible bathrooms.

Everyone in there was sitting at little tables having a really good time drinking and hanging out with friends.

It's like this little oasis of authenticity in a desert of tourism. I say this as a frequent , unabashed tourist of the area ... I'm the guy who comes through town on business once or twice a month and wanders up here from Union Square in search of books, booze and Beats.  Totally insufferable, and completely unapologetic.  If it means anything, I am on a constant quest to dine and drink where the locals do, preferring to eschew my own kind and find out where the quality of service and goods are both high enough to impress the residents. \n\nAnyhow, Specs -- all credit to my buddy Adam (now a full-time resident of the city) for turning me onto this place.  We once held up a couple of barstools here for most of a Monday holiday after crawling our way down the street from the Rogue Public House, City Lights and Cafe Trieste. We rolled in around 4:30 p.m.  4 hours and 4 or 5 whiskeys later, we realized we'd passed one of the better evenings of our acquaintance just sitting there, shooting the shit with the regulars, reading our books and sipping some of Ireland's finest (if you're keeping score at home, that means Jameson's). The bartender brought us some delicious cheese and Saltines and introduced us to her daughter, who'd just wandered in to show mom her new tattoo (a Hawaiian dancer with her mother's name wriggling on the belly). \n\nThe clientle is a good mix of crusty regulars doing their livers no favors, familiar writerly types who occasionally stop to post a recent poem on the bulletin board and younger patrons like me and Adam, taking the bait on all manner of conversational fishing lines.\n\nWe got into an animated discussion with one older regular over the meaning of the word \"Huckleberry,\" trying to discern its definiton from contextual clues in both Henry Mancini's \"Moon River,\" (\"my huckleberry friend\") and the movie Tombstone (\"I'm your huckleberry\"). I sought advice from Dictionary.com via my trio, and then Wikipedia -- but our partner in the back-and-forth was having none of it (\"All that Internet stuff is complete crap!\"). After disappearing from the bar for a good half-hour or more, he re-appeared at the bar spouting the definition at top volume, having gone across the street to City Lights bookstore to look it up in a slang dictionary.  \n\nThat's Specs.

You know, one that is special, one that houses a lot of memories and has been there throughout my many years in San Francisco. What do you think?\", \n\nI expected a barrage of ideas. I thought these people were actually paying attention. I thought our times together were special and my stories were entertaining. I have given them a lot of love, and time, since meeting them. I am sure I gave them a pretty good glimpse into my life before yelp. \n\nInstead I was met with a whole lot of blank stares, a lot of unintelligible mumbling, the excuse \"You have already written reviews of all of the places we have been\" and the idea that I have no more bars left to write about. In short, I discovered that my friends have the attention span of a fifth of vodka. \n\nWell, bitches, sober up for just a minute! I have a whole lot of bar review left in this pickled brain, despite my best efforts to forget the last 6 months of my life and quite possibly other bits and pieces prior. You will not again forget that there are thousands of bars in this city, and that I have been to most of them. You will remember that there are plenty of places we have been together that I have yet to review.\n\nSpecs is the bar I have chosen to help me try to jog your memory and show you the way. If you have not been here with me you will go. I will tell you stories of other bars I haven't yet reviewed. I will get you drunk and reference your behavior in future bar reviews. You will learn to pay attention. Or you will get drunk and forget. \n\nOkay, now that we are clear, and without further ado, here is my 500th review;\n\nI have been to Specs at least as many times as I have sat down to my computer to write a review.

It is good that the people who drink here are patient enough to wait in the hallway while people do things in the restrooms. It is good that they have a bartender named Dancer, who is not actually a reindeer, because it would be hard to pour a strong G&T with hooves. It is good that they cleaned up the front and added urns of flowers and lights so that you don't trip on a homeless person on your way out.

She obliged for some reason.\nThe gentleman sat next to me and he and his party proceeded to drop the tumbler full of Baily's into their Guiness, splashing a little and complaining about how if she'd just given them shot glasses, there would be no mess. \nTwo minutes later, she storms over with a rag in hand and reprimands them for doing the carbombs. \"On good faith I gave those to you, and now look at what you did. It's disgusting, its gross. It's a mess I have to clean up.\" The whole party sat there wide eyed like 5th graders being yelled at. The man stammered an apology and she responded with something like \"YEAH, WELL.\"  After she left the guy wondered aloud, \"Well..why did she give us the makings for a car bomb then..?\"\nGood point. And sure, they were jerks for making a mess.

The inside is decorated with a ton of stuff, and is lit to suggest that at some point the hobbits stopped here for a drink on the way to mordor. Also appropriate for the people up front playing magic: the gathering. All nerdy-ness aside, this is a great place for groups as there's several tables as well as the bar. We went on a Monday night, and it was fairly empty, but I hear from some friends of mine that it's a great place for a Friday or Saturday night. Cheers!", "author": "Stephanie D."}

Even at their busiest its never really \"too busy\". You can usually grab a table and a drink without too much trouble. This plus the fact they have CHEESE (alas, not free though), plus all the awesome and/or crazy stuff they have all over the walls makes it the perfect spot to hang out and recuperate before hitting the craziness that is North Beach again.", "author": "Jeff S."}

One of the last places to actually display a sense of the Barbary Coast.  Appropriately located across from City Lights and Vesuvio, and next to Jazz at Pearls and Hustler's back door, Spec's is a throw back bordering on Nostalgic, like fisherman, bums and beatniks used to party here as kids in the mission think they party now.  Laid back, but not a drunkards bar, though it looks like they may have been there decades ago.  They have cheese and crackers for you, interesting reading selection, and the requisite scary bathrooms for every bar  in north beach.  Again, it just adds to the charm.", "author": "Christian W."}

Had a girl date with the SF BFF and suggested we just walk from work. I asked if she ever went to specs ad shed never heard of it. So we wandered over. Um, outside patio is cute, then you walk inside and its a smelly dive with old adventurer type stuff on the walls (we compared topossibly what indiana jones would put on the wall, but not so amazing). We sat down and both being winos asked if they had a wine llist and immediately were embarassed that we did. No wine list one red or one white - ok two reds it is. then my buddy asked if they might have any food or snackies - cheese and crackers was her reply. Again we just confirmed our being out of place and new to the joint. But she brought us some snackies and we were good for the night. there was a random mix in the bar had we of stayed for a few hours I'm sure we would have made some new friends as there's not pretension in the air at all.

Certainly not the hot spot for the hipster set, but thus is the basis of it's appeal.  Specs is the consummate 'neighbourhood watering hole'--where everyone seems to know everybody else (in a completely unpretentious way), most of the crowd are aging North Beach denizens, gossiping and swapping armchair radical politics and conspiracy theories...like a doughnut shop that sells booze.  Frequently you'll find the resident pianoman playing ragtime in the back, and there's usually a jam session composed of patrons, neighbours and the occasional bindlestiff nursing a Steelie out front.  Perhaps it's the quirky decor (the '12 Adler Museum' itself) that gives the crowd something to aspire to.  Strange maritime artifacts, masks, stolen signs, a quasi-Egyptian sarcophagus with moving eyes and spectacles cover the walls, and draw the gaze of many a drunkenly lazy eye.  My favourite:  the sign above the bar notifying patrons, \"We reserve the right to serve refuse to anyone.\"\n\nAnother of Specs' finer qualities is that steady business from neighbourhood regulars removes any need to tolerate bullshit from the bridge-and-tunnel fratboys/meatheads that make North Beach a rather miserable place on Friday/Saturday nights.  On more than one occasion have i been in Specs and seen loud, overweight twenty-somethings in \"Frisco\" hats walk in smelling like the strip club they just left, only to be tossed out in no uncertain terms by the bartender.  \"Spring break's over, asshat, better go back to Concord.\"\n\nA word about Specs himself, the bar's owner and namesake.  He bought the bar in 1968 (it apparently used to be a lesbian speakeasy), and he's been among the most adored neighbourhood personalities ever since.  Known for his generosity and quick-witted deadpan, Specs also hosts an annual celebration in honor of the man who saved his life.  Practically the whole neighbourhood shows up, and lots of people bring food to share.  The result is an impressive spread, and everyone's first drink is free.\n\nDefinitely the place to rub elbows with the locals...definitely NOT a tourist place...", "author": "J. Brandon L."}

First discovered Spec's when I stumbled down the stairs from the Garden of Eden above looking for the john. Figured it was some sort of den of iniquity at the time (this was about the early 70's, my how time flies) and didn't really put it together as \"Spec's\" until a friend \"Art\" took us there in '79 and introduced us to Gary Snyder (who was mildly underwhelming btw). Anyhow, tho not a native of The City, I make it a point to check -up on the esteemed establishment every few years when I return to The City as a tourist. So come the last day of February I'm showing my sweetie the sights and 12 Adler is on the list. We pull up a couple stools at the bar, you meet a better crowd that way, and the first thing I notice is how clean the place is, someone has actually spiffed the place up. Same funky stuff on the walls, just now it's not covered in smoke-crusted dust. Strike up a chat with the local guy next to us and he introduces us to Lucy who's tending bar (manager maybe). Lucy is one sweet lady, friendly, welcoming; who later in the evening actually buys us a drink to celebrate my companion's first trip to The City as a real grownup. Now, how nice is that? During the course of the evening a gentleman started playing the piano in the back, looked to be a customer, and laid down some sweet licks, old show tunes just smooth as silk. Anyhow the vibe is easy-going, funky, warm, friendly; just a nice, relaxing place to hang. And Lucy is real class. I'd give it 5 stars, but I don't want you to think I'm 'just a tourist'. Maybe not quite the place to carry on and flout your hubris, perhaps you can find that on down the street.", "author": "gary S."}

To me it is a welcome oasis of relative calm and genuine SF flavor in a swirling ocean of douchebaggery that is presently North Beach. I dig the lighting, the furnishings, the museum, and everything else about the joint except for the occasional clients who really don't appreciate Specs' like summa you oblivious types. First, off, for those of you who complain that the bartender asked you to quiet down because he/she did not appreciate your rendition of 'We Will Rock You,' ease up - house rules. There are plenty of bars where you can do that (Marina Sports Bar comes to mind). Also, this is a professional drinkingman's bar, not a place to order douchey frat drinks. Stick to beer, whiskey, and simple mixed drinks. Irish car bombs are for douches and probably don't go over that well with the Irish bartenders. I know a lot of you like places to be super loud so you feel that you are important, but Specs' really isn't the place to see and be seen. It is the eye of the hurricane; it is a place where you can take a book and even write a bit if you want to. There are plenty of establishments where you can bray like a donkey and \"get stupid,\" (Blondies comes to mind), go there. Leave Specs alone and let us who enjoy it the way it is, continue to enjoy it.", "author": "Christopher V."}

On this night, there were a few people playing guitar outside the front door. When you go inside, it is dimly lit and there's a lot of random stuff on the walls. Most notably, a lot of old time nude women photos. There's too much random stuff to mention, you just have to see it for yourself. There's a piano in the back with a piano man playing tunes. My friend did get him to play happy birthday for her. Another nice thing about this place is that you don't get the feeling that you should order a certain drink or look a certain way to be here. You can just show up and hang out. I'm sure there's a lot of places like this, but, it was more apparent here. Anyway, minus 1 star for cash only. I", "author": "Andrew Y."}

I have been going to Spec's for about five years now, and about a year ago I was in there with my boyfriend and while we were sitting at a table drinking a little man was busily spinning colorful, metal, toy tops on his table. He must have had about twenty of them. Then he started scrawling in his sketchbook. Meanwhile the hunched, well dressed, man with a beak, whose name I always forget, came and began to play ragtime music on the piano. Then a drag queen in a blue flapper's dress with a torn shawl began singing Edith Piaf to the piano player's music. She fanned herself with a lace fan that had spines missing from it. She looked like Katherine Hepburn after 40 years of heroine use. Then the little artist man got up and delivered a picture of my boyfriend and I that he had scrawled. About this time the drag queen stopped singing, and started arguing with the bartender. The piano man kept playing Edith Piaf. The bartender finally came, grabbed the belligerent drag queen by the arm, and they started to struggle with each other. Then out of the darkness from behind the piano a tall, beautiful black woman steps out and finishes the Edith Piaf song while the bartender pulled the drag queen out of the bar. It almost made me want to quit drinking because I knew I would never have such a lovely bar experience as that. I have had some that rivaled it, but not in the same genre. In short I would recommend this bar to magical people, and hope that yuppies, ignoramuses, and ultra-hipsters stay away.

Crazy characters hang out in front too, sometimes selling art. I had one dude refer to me and my left-leaning, if not socialist, friends as \"sadists\".
